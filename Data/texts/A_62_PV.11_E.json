(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. José Maria Neves, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Cape Verde \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Cape Verde. \r\n Mr. José Maria Neves, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. José Maria \r\nNeves, Prime Minister of the Republic of Cape Verde, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Neves (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): While we \r\ncommend the United Nations for having chosen \r\nclimate change as the theme for this sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly, at the same time we \r\nrecall that many countries in the South have, in recent \r\ndecades, warned the international community about \r\nthis phenomenon, which is being experienced here and \r\nthere through the drama of droughts and \r\ndesertification. Climate change has multiple causes, \r\nsome natural and others generated by human action. \r\nTherefore, the responsibilities of States and societies \r\nwith respect to these changes are not equal. Nor are the \r\nimpacts they have on the lives of the common citizen. \r\nLikewise, we do not have the same scientific, \r\ntechnological or financial means to prevent the \r\nnegative effects of climate change. \r\n At this point, I would like to say a few words \r\nabout drought and desertification, which demonstrate, \r\nwithout a doubt, the change of climate in the West \r\nAfrican subregion. It is needless to mention their \r\ndevastating impact on the economic and social life of \r\nthe populations. Unfortunately, in spite of conferences \r\nand grandiloquent conclusions and declarations, the \r\nrepeated calls from the Sahel have received half-heated \r\nand inconsistent responses. In view of the profound \r\nimplications of this stance for the lives of populations \r\nand States, some are depicting those responses as an \r\nabdication of responsibility on the part of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Climate change is, without any doubt, a world \r\nchallenge with many dimensions and the potential to \r\nrestructure economic, social and political life. Most \r\nlikely, we have wasted too much time in discussion, \r\nthereby delaying global acceptance of the problem and, \r\nconsequently, the formulation of strategies for \r\nadaptation and mitigation. \r\n In brief, I would like to underline the catastrophic \r\neffects, both present and future, of climate change and \r\nmore specifically, of drought and desertification on \r\nsmall island States. If the projections on sea level rise \r\nprove to be true, we will be facing a disaster of \r\nunimaginable proportions. \r\n My country, Cape Verde, an archipelago of \r\nmodest physical and demographic dimensions, is a \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 2 \r\n \r\nsmall island State and has experienced drought and \r\ndesertification and suffered from almost uninterrupted \r\nwater shortages for more than three decades. \r\n Indeed, Cape Verde, given its location, size, \r\nlandscape and the insular and archipelagic \r\ncharacteristics of its territory, is a prime example of the \r\nconvergence and concentration of the negative effects \r\nof climate change. Drought and desertification have an \r\nunquestionable impact on family income and the \r\npoverty rate. They also undermine Government efforts \r\nand strongly condition the mobilization and allocation \r\nof resources for development financing. \r\n In the light of the challenges of climate change, \r\none should recall the leading role that the United \r\nNations has had and continues to have in mustering \r\nefforts to raise awareness about this critical problem \r\nfor the future of mankind. We are convinced that the \r\nBali conference will set new parameters based on the \r\nprinciple of equity, the legitimate aspirations of \r\npopulations to development and the differentiated \r\nresponsibilities of each and everyone. \r\n We therefore call on the United Nations to pursue \r\nits efforts in this area and give very special attention to \r\nsmall island States, which have to contend with \r\nmultiple fragilities and vulnerabilities. It is imperative \r\nto resume and implement the Mauritius Strategy for the \r\nFurther Implementation of the Programme of Action \r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \r\nDeveloping States. The community of nations cannot \r\nbut acknowledge that, given their origins and their role \r\nthroughout history, small island States are a “heritage \r\nof mankind”. \r\n In spite of its structural vulnerabilities and its \r\nundeniable lack of natural resources, Cape Verde has, \r\nsince independence in 1975, followed a positive and \r\nconsistent development path. It is in this context that \r\nwe should consider Cape Verde’s graduation or, in \r\nother words, its withdrawal from the group of least \r\ndeveloped countries as of 2008. We are resolved to rise \r\nto the challenge of this new development stage and \r\nthrough audacious strategies and decisions to transform \r\nthe country. We are quite aware that the main \r\nresponsibility for Cape Verde’s development rests in \r\nthe hands of the Cape Verdean Government and \r\ncitizens. This is the spirit that has guided us in the past, \r\nand it is the spirit that will allow us to face the \r\nchallenge of graduation. Nevertheless, during the \r\ntransition period we hope to be able to count on strong \r\npartnership from the international community in \r\ndealing with Cape Verde’s structural fragility and any \r\nnew vulnerabilities. \r\n In this regard, I call on the United Nations and \r\nMember States to pay special attention to the \r\ndeclaration of the United Nations Transition Assistance \r\nGroup and to the report that the Government will soon \r\ndeliver to the Secretary-General in accordance with the \r\nresolution on graduation which the General Assembly \r\nadopted in December 2004. \r\n While it is true that our development strategy is \r\nopen, daring and driven by the desire to create \r\nopportunities for foreign direct investment, it is no less \r\ntrue that today, more than ever, we need innovative aid \r\nand financing modalities that are better adjusted to the \r\npace we want to set for Cape Verde’s development and \r\nto the imperatives of the transition. It is high time that \r\nwe move from discourse to action with respect to \r\nownership, in accordance with the spirit of the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. \r\n Allow me also briefly to recall the transborder \r\nand global nature of many modern day phenomena. I \r\nrefer to climate change and, of course, to terrorism, \r\norganized crime and trafficking of all kinds. These \r\nrepresent a threat to human security and to the \r\ndemocratic rule of law, as they corrupt values, \r\ncompromise development and thwart the most \r\nlegitimate expectations of peoples. \r\n We are living at a time when problems and threats \r\nare of concern to all. They are not confined to a single \r\nState or region. Nor can there be local solutions to the \r\nglobal threats of our era. Responses to these issues will \r\nbe ineffective unless they are undertaken within a \r\nrobust, balanced and fair multilateral perspective. \r\n The United Nations is, and should continue to be, \r\nthe foundation, the guarantor and the forum of \r\nmultilateralism. We are strongly convinced that the \r\nUnited Nations must be strengthened for the sake of \r\nthe future of the world and of the ideals of peace, \r\nsecurity and development. And we are all faced with \r\nthe challenge of translating the reiterated statements of \r\nthe international community into coherent and \r\nconsistent action. It is a question of credibility in the \r\neyes of the world, which is watching us. \r\n I cannot conclude without extending my \r\ngreetings, congratulations and encouragement to the \r\nSecretary-General and wishing him success in guiding \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n3 07-52121 \r\n \r\nour common Organization towards fully attaining its \r\nfounding goals and meeting the imperatives of \r\nincreased efficiency, modernization and \r\ndemocratization in its work. \r\n Likewise, I would like to extend warm greetings \r\nto you, Mr. President, and to assure you of our \r\nconfidence that you will face the important challenges \r\nconfronting the Assembly with serenity and a sense of \r\nduty. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Cape Verde for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. José Maria Neves, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n Address by Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Turkey \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nTurkey. \r\n Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Erdoğan (Turkey) (spoke in Turkish; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure once again to address this body where \r\nwe unite our goals and labours for a better and brighter \r\nfuture. I wish to wholeheartedly congratulate you, \r\nSir — our good friend the former Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim — on your election to preside over this global \r\nforum. \r\n I would also like on this occasion to pay tribute to \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and to wish \r\nhim success in his current position. \r\n Our world today needs, more than ever before, \r\neffective cooperation to find common solutions to our \r\nglobal problems, to replace desperation with hope, \r\npoverty with prosperity, injustice with justice and \r\nviolence with peace around the world. The United \r\nNations, created precisely for that mission, is the only \r\ninternational forum that can possibly, with our \r\ncollective resolve, lead us to those objectives. The \r\nUnited Nations is also the source of international \r\nlegitimacy for our actions to those ends. But, it is \r\nincumbent on us, the Member States, to make the \r\nOrganization stronger and more effective and to furnish \r\nit with the means and structures it needs to tackle \r\ncompetently the many challenges of our century. \r\n Here, I believe we need to be more resolute and \r\nbold in our actions while adopting more forthcoming \r\nand creative approaches. Although significant \r\nstructural reforms have been realized, the process is far \r\nfrom completed. The reform process must continue, \r\nand structural and functional adjustments should be \r\nmade to respond to needs that may arise. \r\n We must bear in mind that reforming the Security \r\nCouncil in a way that would command the widest \r\npossible consensus would also reflect positively on the \r\nlegitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the United \r\nNations itself. \r\n I wish on this occasion also to confirm Turkey’s \r\ncandidature for a seat on the Security Council at the \r\nelections to be held next year. My country, which is \r\ncommitted to the ideals enshrined in the Charter and \r\nwhich constructively contributes to the maintenance of \r\nglobal peace at a strategic crossroads where different \r\ncontinents and cultures meet, has not been represented \r\non the Council for almost half a century. I genuinely \r\nbelieve that with the valuable support of its fellow \r\nMember States, Turkey, with its European and Asian \r\nidentity, can assume a distinctive and constructive role \r\nin harmonizing and reconciling differing views within \r\nthe Security Council, just as it does in its efforts to \r\nfacilitate harmony among cultures. \r\n We have reached an important stage in the \r\nimplementation phase of the Alliance of Civilizations \r\ninitiative under the auspices of the Secretary-General; \r\nwe are co-sponsoring this initiative together with \r\nSpain. We are determined to make our vision of global \r\nharmony become a reality through the implementation \r\nof concrete projects under the strong leadership of the \r\nHigh Representative, the former President of Portugal, \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio, and with the support that I am \r\nconfident the international community will not deny \r\nthis initiative. The meeting held at the United Nations \r\nwith the Alliance Group of Friends earlier this week \r\nserved to renew our hope and confidence in the \r\npromising future of the initiative. \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 4 \r\n \r\n The vast majority of international problems of \r\nhigh priority on the agenda of the United Nations are \r\ntaking place in our immediate surroundings, the scene \r\nof major tension and transformation. We are exerting \r\nevery effort to constructively contribute to the \r\nresolution of all these disputes — which directly \r\nimpact Turkey, although we are not party to any of \r\nthem. In doing so, we seek to utilize the many \r\npossibilities offered by our strategic position, our \r\naccumulated knowledge of and insight into the region, \r\nour cultural and historical ties and our vast experience \r\nin peacekeeping. \r\n Our highest priority is to restore stability in our \r\nregion. In that connection, Turkey will resolutely \r\npursue its efforts to serve as an important factor for \r\npeace and stability and to promote multidimensional \r\nrelations with all its neighbours. The encouraging level \r\nwe have achieved in our relations with Greece today as \r\na result of the process of rapprochement that we have \r\nbeen pursuing for nearly 10 years is the tangible \r\noutcome of that resolve. \r\n Likewise, ensuring a dignified place within the \r\ninternational community for a territorially intact, \r\nnationally unified and democratic Iraq at peace with \r\nitself and with its neighbours is at the top of our \r\npriorities for restoring stability in our region. \r\n In line with our desire to realize this common \r\nvision, we continue to diversify our cooperation with \r\nthe Iraqi Government and support the process of \r\npolitical dialogue and national reconciliation in this \r\ncountry. The group of neighbouring countries of Iraq, \r\ncreated upon Turkey’s initiative and later expanded at \r\nthe meeting held in Sharm el-Sheikh to include the \r\npermanent five members of the Security Council and \r\nthe Group of Eight, is similarly intended to serve such \r\na purpose. The next ministerial meeting of the \r\nexpanded group of neighbouring countries will be \r\nhosted by Turkey at the beginning of November this \r\nyear. \r\n Another major source of instability in our region \r\nis the Middle East problem. We regard the question of \r\nPalestine, with wide repercussions both in and beyond \r\nthe region, as the crux of all ills in the Middle East. \r\nThe political rift within Palestine has further \r\ncomplicated the situation. Therefore, a lasting political \r\nsolution to the question of Palestine and peace with \r\nIsrael on the basis of a two-State solution will have \r\nimportant implications for regional as well as global \r\nstability. We believe that a negotiated settlement to this \r\nlong-standing dispute will also reflect positively on the \r\nresolution of other problems in the region. We stand \r\nready to support in every way possible the parties in \r\nthe efforts to revive the peace process and to contribute \r\nto the prospective international meetings to be \r\nconvened for this purpose. \r\n We hope to see the ongoing political crisis in \r\nLebanon promptly overcome through dialogue among \r\nthe different factions. We will continue our intense \r\nefforts, including our contributions to the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon, to assist in restoring \r\nstability in that country. \r\n We will also continue to invest in the democratic, \r\nfree and prosperous future of the friendly people of \r\nAfghanistan. Our commitment to the security of the \r\ncountry by assuming the command of the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force twice since its inception and \r\ncurrently of the Regional Command in Kabul, together \r\nwith our contributions to the reconstruction effort \r\nthrough significant infrastructure projects, are the \r\nconcrete expression of the challenging mission we \r\nhave undertaken in Afghanistan. The activities of the \r\nTurkish Provincial Reconstruction Team in the \r\nprovince of Wardak, carrying out its functions under \r\ndangerous security conditions, are also part of this \r\neffort. \r\n Moreover, the process of tripartite summits that \r\nwe have initiated, with the participation of Afghanistan \r\nand Pakistan, in the desire to enhance peace and \r\nstability in the region is helping to restore confidence \r\nbetween these two neighbouring countries. \r\n On the other hand, frozen conflicts pending a \r\nresolution continue to jeopardize regional peace and \r\nstability in the South Caucasus. Solutions to be found \r\nthrough peaceful means to existing frozen conflicts \r\nshould be based on the territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty of Azerbaijan and Georgia. \r\n In order to realize our vision of peace, stability \r\nand economic prosperity for the region, we not only \r\nseek to contribute to the resolution of these frozen \r\nconflicts, but at the same time continue to invest in the \r\ninfrastructure of regional cooperation through \r\nsignificant energy and transportation projects, such as \r\nthe Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum oil \r\nand natural gas pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars \r\nrailroad. \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n5 07-52121 \r\n \r\n At this juncture where uncertainty regarding the \r\nfinal status of Kosovo persists, we continue to maintain \r\nour view that we must mobilize all efforts to find a just \r\nand sustainable solution to this question. Turkey has \r\ncurrently assumed the command of the Kosovo Force \r\nMultinational Task Force South in the region. \r\n Turkey performs noble duties from the \r\nperspective of peacekeeping in almost all the regions \r\ncited above. Through its participation in various \r\npeacekeeping operations conducted under the banner of \r\nthe United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty \r\nOrganization, the European Union and the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \r\nTurkey has proven its capacity to significantly \r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. In this connection Turkey is also \r\nfavourably considering participation in the African \r\nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, \r\nestablished in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolution 1769 (2007), whose adoption we highly \r\nwelcomed. \r\n To the extent that we can stop and prevent the \r\nrecurrence of conflicts that exhaust our energy and \r\nresources, we will be better able to focus on global \r\nproblems that will define the common fate of \r\nhumankind. At the top of these problems is the issue of \r\nclimate change, which you, Mr. President, have in a \r\nvery timely manner designated as the main theme of \r\nthe General Assembly this year. \r\n We discussed this issue requiring urgent \r\ncollective action in all its aspects during the high-level \r\nmeeting that I also had the opportunity to attend earlier \r\nthis week. The most conclusive outcome of this \r\nmeeting was that we must all assume our fair share of \r\nresponsibility in effective international cooperation to \r\nfind solutions to global warming and climate change, \r\nwhich pose, as never before, a grave threat to \r\nhumankind’s survival. \r\n Another grim reality in this context is that the \r\ndeveloping world, bearing the least responsibility for \r\nclimate change, will be the most adversely affected by \r\nits consequences. It is therefore incumbent on us all to \r\nassist, to the best of our ability, the developing \r\ncountries in overcoming the many overwhelming \r\nchallenges that they confront. \r\n To this end, Turkey is rapidly becoming a donor \r\ncountry with the significant development, technical and \r\nhumanitarian assistance it has been providing in recent \r\nyears. The development aid provided by Turkey \r\nthrough official and private sources reached 1.7 billion \r\ndollars last year. We intend to continue our \r\ncontributions to the relevant United Nations funds, as \r\nwell as assistance at the bilateral level. \r\n The Ministerial Conference of the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries hosted by Turkey in Istanbul in \r\nJuly this summer is another concrete expression of our \r\nresolve to assist the developing countries and enable \r\nthem to take full advantage of the benefits of \r\nglobalization. We are already taking steps to follow up \r\non the outcome of this conference. \r\n Our commitment to peace and development in \r\nAfrica also finds expression in our development \r\nassistance to the continent coordinated through the \r\nbranch offices of the Turkish International Cooperation \r\nand Development Agency, which have been established \r\nsince 2005 in Ethiopia, Sudan and Senegal. The \r\nTurkey-Africa Cooperation Summit, which we will \r\nhost in 2008, and our participation in seven different \r\nUnited Nations and European Union peacekeeping \r\nmissions in Africa are other concrete examples to this \r\neffect. \r\n Turkey also seeks to diversify and expand its \r\nnetwork of political and commercial cooperation with \r\nthe countries of South Asia, the Far East and the \r\nPacific region, as well as Latin American countries and \r\nthe Caribbean. \r\n Terrorism continues to threaten the security of all \r\nfree nations. An act of terror committed in any part of \r\nthe world in essence targets us all, as it constitutes a \r\nheinous crime against humanity. We condemn in the \r\nstrongest terms this scourge that recognizes no national \r\nboundaries. As the Prime Minister of a nation that has \r\nexperienced first-hand the bitter consequences of \r\nterrorism, I renew from this rostrum my appeal to the \r\ninternational community for an enhanced collective \r\ncommitment and cooperation in the combat against this \r\nthreat to humanity. \r\n Considering the sophisticated new technologies \r\nterrorist elements are utilizing today, effective \r\ninternational cooperation to prevent the proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction takes on a whole new \r\nmeaning and urgency. Turkey strongly supports the \r\nUnited Nations and the United Nations-led efforts to \r\nintensify international cooperation aimed at preventing \r\ntheir proliferation. \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 6 \r\n \r\n Finally, Turkey and the Turkish Republic of \r\nNorthern Cyprus have been supporting the efforts to \r\nfind a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem \r\nunder the good-offices mission of the United Nations \r\nSecretary-General on the basis of well established \r\nUnited Nations parameters. The United Nations \r\nremains the sole forum for a solution. \r\n It should be recalled that the comprehensive \r\nsettlement plan of the former United Nations \r\nSecretary-General emerged in 2004 as a result of \r\nextensive negotiations between the parties and was \r\nsubmitted to a simultaneous referendum on both sides \r\nof the island. The Turkish side overwhelmingly voted \r\nin favour of the Secretary-General’s plan, whose \r\nimpartiality cannot in any way be called into question. \r\nThe Greek Cypriots, however, were misled by their \r\nleadership to reject the plan. \r\n Despite the constructive attitude displayed by the \r\nTurkish side since then, no progress has been achieved \r\ntowards a settlement owing to the intransigence of the \r\nGreek Cypriot side. It is our hope that the Annan \r\nreport, which has not been endorsed yet by the Security \r\nCouncil, will be endorsed soon. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n Address by Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign and \r\nPolitical Affairs and Economic Planning of \r\nthe Republic of San Marino \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Head of Government and Minister for \r\nForeign and Political Affairs and Economic Planning of \r\nthe Republic of San Marino. \r\n Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign and Political Affairs and \r\nEconomic Planning of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Fiorenzo Stolfi, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign and Political \r\nAffairs and Economic Planning of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Stolfi (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe Government and the people of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, I join the unanimous tribute paid to you, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session by \r\nexpressing my most sincere congratulations on your \r\nelection to this high office. I am confident that you will \r\nbe able to give new momentum to the process of \r\nrenewal and reform of the United Nations. \r\n In particular, I wish to express my gratitude and \r\nappreciation to the outgoing President, Her Excellency \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, who has carried out \r\nwith determination and commitment an intense activity \r\naimed at implementing the reform programme \r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General. \r\n The Republic of San Marino is deeply concerned \r\nabout the latest events in Myanmar and expresses its \r\nsolidarity to the families of the victims. We hope that \r\nthe violence will soon be stopped and a dialogue \r\nimmediately re-established. \r\n The Republic of San Marino firmly believes in \r\nthe role and effectiveness of the entire structure of the \r\nUnited Nations, as well as in the process of progressive \r\nrenewal of its main bodies, which is now more than \r\never necessary, given time, evolution and the need to \r\nbest enhance the participation by the great family of \r\nthe Member States in the management of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n A small country like San Marino gains \r\nconsiderable strength and legitimacy from the major \r\ninternational organizations in its efforts to make its \r\nvoice heard regarding the great issues and main \r\nchallenges of our time. We are still determined to play \r\nthis role and will continue to fulfil the commitments \r\nundertaken, individually or in partnership with other \r\ncountries, to affirm those principles of solidarity and \r\nthe protection of rights, in which our history is rooted. \r\n In this regard, we believe that forms of \r\ncooperation among small countries can prove \r\nundoubtedly useful to major projects and deliver \r\npositive and effective messages of multilateral \r\ncooperation, in a spirit of mutual belonging to an \r\ninternational community, albeit still characterized by \r\nlarge gaps. \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n7 07-52121 \r\n \r\n In this context, an example is the commitment \r\ntaken by San Marino, together with a group of small \r\nEuropean countries, in favour of a United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund project against HIV and destined for \r\nchildren living in Gabon. At the same time, the small \r\ncountries are intensifying their contacts within the \r\nUnited Nations to adopt further joint intervention \r\nprogrammes, mainly of a humanitarian character. \r\n The Republic of San Marino promotes and \r\nsupports, with the strength of its millenary history of \r\ncivilization, peace and respect for human rights, any \r\ncall advanced at a national or international level \r\nentailing a moral and civil commitment to the \r\naffirmation of specific ideological and cultural \r\nidentities, which, as is the case for San Marino, are \r\nbased on the principles of peaceful coexistence and \r\nrespect for others. \r\n It is in this spirit that my country believes in and \r\nactively commits itself to the promotion of \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue, as a \r\nfundamental instrument to prevent tensions and \r\nconflicts arising from intolerance and to promote peace \r\nbased on the principles of respect for fundamental \r\nhuman rights, justice and international cooperation. \r\n During its six-month chairmanship of the \r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, \r\nwhich ended last May, the Republic of San Marino \r\nbased its activity on the promotion of a culture of \r\ntolerance and mutual understanding by organizing \r\nhigh-level meetings and debates aimed at fostering \r\ndialogue among cultures and religions. In this context, \r\nthe conference organized last April in San Marino on \r\nthe religious dimension of intercultural dialogue in \r\nEurope, a priority issue of the San Marino \r\nchairmanship, met with great success. This conference \r\nwas attended by the representatives of the Council of \r\nEurope member countries, religious leaders belonging \r\nto the three major European monotheistic religions and \r\nexperts from civil society. At the end of its work, the \r\nconference adopted a final document, which testifies to \r\nthe wide range of this debate and marks a significant \r\nmoment in the process undertaken by the Council of \r\nEurope to promote, stimulate and develop intercultural \r\ndialogue in Europe, with particular reference to its \r\nreligious dimension. \r\n Among the initiatives taken in the last few \r\nmonths on this issue, it is worth mentioning the \r\nmeeting organized by the Permanent Mission of San \r\nMarino in New York on dialogue between religions, \r\nwith the presence and participation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the President of the General Assembly and \r\nrepresentatives of more than 70 countries. \r\n In line with its history of peace, which makes it \r\nan ideal place for meeting and mediation, the Republic \r\nof San Marino will coordinate, starting from next year, \r\nthe future meetings of the Council of Europe on the \r\nreligious dimension of intercultural dialogue. It is in \r\nthis spirit that I will take part next week in the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace, organized \r\nby the presidency of the General Assembly. \r\n My country welcomes the adoption of this \r\ninitiative, which further stresses the need for us to join \r\nour efforts in support of dialogue among cultures and \r\nreligions, as an instrument to strengthen the climate of \r\nconfidence indispensable to promote peace, prevent \r\nconflicts and combat the threat of discrimination, \r\nracism, violence and terrorism. \r\n The Republic of San Marino is particularly \r\nsensitive to the issue of climate change, in the \r\nconviction that addressing this problem is an \r\nimperative for each member of the international \r\ncommunity, called upon to take action and share \r\ncommon strategies to prevent and face situations of \r\ndegradation and extreme emergency, which are \r\nbecoming increasingly evident and require joint actions \r\nthat can no longer be postponed. We are witnessing \r\nalarming phenomena that are deteriorating every \r\nelement of the environment, mainly due to human \r\nactivities. It is therefore necessary to develop \r\nalternative strategies, which can protect the climate \r\nfrom the increasingly serious threat posed to the entire \r\necosystem. \r\n The San Marino Government has expressed its \r\nstrong determination to progressively accede to the \r\nmajor international instruments, adopted in the \r\nframework of the United Nations, on environmental \r\nprotection and gas emissions, from the Vienna \r\nConvention and Montreal Protocol thereto, to the \r\nKyoto Protocol, in the awareness that the consequences \r\nof climate change are a serious obstacle to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. At \r\na domestic level, San Marino is preparing legislation \r\npromoting new technologies based on renewable \r\nenergy sources that will substantially modify the \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 8 \r\n \r\nenergetic and environmental habits of the entire \r\ncountry. \r\n Just a few days ago, the Secretary-General \r\norganized a high-level event on climate change, which \r\ngave further momentum to the activity of our \r\nGovernments. \r\n It is worth reiterating that we take a strong stance \r\nagainst the death penalty on the basis of political and \r\nmoral principles. Indeed, the death penalty denies the \r\nright to life, and we deem it a groundless deterrent, as \r\ndo an increasing number of countries, which are \r\nprogressively abolishing it from their legal systems. \r\nThe Republic of San Marino expresses its satisfaction \r\nat the steps taken in this direction at a multilateral level \r\nand supports the new interregional initiative. We are \r\nconvinced that by promoting first of all a moratorium, \r\neach and every country can gradually achieve a \r\nmoderate attitude and eventually reach the decision to \r\nabolish the death penalty. \r\n San Marino fully shares the commitment \r\nundertaken on a global scale to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and is ready to offer its own \r\ncontribution and its partnership to eradicate endemic \r\nproblems, by fully recognizing the fundamental rights \r\nof the most vulnerable groups of society, such as the \r\nelderly, women, children and disabled people. \r\n In this regard, I would like to underline in \r\nparticular the value of the action carried out by the \r\nUnited Nations in favour of social policies addressed to \r\npersons with disabilities, which has led to the adoption \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Rights of \r\nPersons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. In \r\nthis context, the Republic of San Marino was one of \r\nthe first States to subscribe to these instruments. \r\n To achieve these objectives, which were also \r\namong the main issues included in the programme of \r\nthe recent chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers \r\nof the Council of Europe, my country has launched \r\nsome awareness raising and effective intervention \r\ncampaigns, such as the campaign on violence against \r\nwomen and in favour of children’s rights. \r\n I wish to refer in particular to the protection of \r\nchildren’s rights, to which my country pays special \r\nattention, prompted by the conviction that only the \r\nmobilization of Governments and societies can save \r\nchildren all over the world from today’s sufferings and \r\nfrom enduring conditions of underdevelopment and \r\npoverty. My country has promoted legislative measures \r\nand solidarity initiatives with the precious contribution \r\nof institutions and civil society, and it commits itself at \r\na political, moral and social level to providing any \r\npossible instrument of protection and guarantee in \r\nfavour of minors. \r\n It is in this spirit and in full agreement with the \r\nprinciples contained in the detailed study on violence \r\nagainst children, drafted by United Nations expert \r\nPaulo Sergio Pinheiro, that the Republic of San Marino \r\nwill soon sign the Convention on the Protection of \r\nChildren against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual \r\nAbuse, adopted by the Council of Europe and aimed at \r\ninvolving the States in the drafting and implementation \r\nof an international plan to prevent and counter these \r\nphenomena. \r\n San Marino is fully aware of the need for the \r\nUnited Nations to maintain and strengthen its own \r\nstructure by revitalizing the main bodies, to attain \r\nimproved efficiency and progressive adjustment to a \r\nbroader multilateral context. \r\n In the light of the above and well aware of its \r\nstatus as a small country, San Marino is however \r\nintensifying its activities within the major international \r\norganizations. It has responsibly taken on the task of \r\nfacilitator assigned to it and to Senegal by the \r\nPresident of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly in the revitalization process of this organ. \r\n This task, performed by the San Marino \r\nPermanent Mission in New York, attributes to this tiny \r\nState a delicate and important role at an international \r\nlevel, which certainly represents a significant \r\nrecognition of the work done since 1992 to the present \r\nand of the commitment with which the Republic \r\nparticipates in the life of the international community, \r\nwith its renewed efforts to enhance dialogue and \r\ncooperation. \r\n The objective of revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly is a priority in the reform and modernization \r\nprocess of the main bodies of the United Nations, since \r\nthe General Assembly is the main representative and \r\ndecision-making body of the Organization, where all \r\nStates are permanent members and can and must play \r\nan important role by virtue of the principles of \r\ndemocracy and equal representation enshrined in this \r\nOrganization. \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n9 07-52121 \r\n \r\n The Republic of San Marino believes it necessary \r\nto strengthen the role of the General Assembly by \r\nenabling it to act efficiently and to cooperate with \r\nother statutory bodies in a more coordinated manner. In \r\nthis regard, San Marino expresses the hope that, in \r\norder to fully support the activities of this body, which \r\nis responsible for the whole process of standardization \r\nand codification of international law, the international \r\ncommunity will commit itself to increasingly receiving \r\nand implementing its resolutions. \r\n At the same time, it reiterates the need to reach \r\nthe broadest possible political agreement on the reform \r\nof the Security Council. This agreement should be the \r\nresult of a concerted and open vision in view of any \r\nadjustments that may be required in the years to come. \r\nFor many years, San Marino has constantly paid great \r\nattention to this issue of topical interest, because of its \r\nstrategic and structural implications. In this regard, I \r\nbelieve that today the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly deserves our unanimous gratitude for its \r\nreport, which represents an excellent basis to continue \r\nto consider this item on the agenda of the sixty-second \r\nsession. \r\n On behalf of a State, the Republic of San Marino, \r\nthat has always based its peaceful coexistence with \r\nother States and the spirit of its profound national and \r\ninternational solidarity on aspirations for international \r\npeace and security, I would like to express my \r\ncomplete confidence in the long-term effectiveness of \r\nthe United Nations system. Each and every State must \r\ntry to make a political and ideological contribution \r\nthrough concrete proposals to that system, on which \r\nevery State continues to place high expectations \r\nbecause of the impact of its activities at a national and \r\ninternational level. \r\n Allow me to conclude my statement by offering a \r\nbrief reflection, by virtue of the fact that I come from a \r\ncountry without any macroeconomic or military \r\ninterests, or any interests regarding the political \r\nbalance among the great Powers. I believe that the \r\nspace and attention we all devote to the international \r\ncommitment and contribution made by every State, \r\neven the smallest, can be a positive investment in the \r\nfuture of the United Nations, a future characterized by \r\nincreased understanding, closer cooperation and the \r\npromotion of dialogue and mutual respect, upon which \r\nthe foundations of this Organization rest. \r\n This renewed momentum will therefore provide \r\nlarge countries with the opportunity to demonstrate \r\ntheir full respect for international justice and will show \r\nsmall countries how useful their activities are in the \r\ncommunity of nations — activities that translate into \r\ncontinuous efforts aimed at achieving peace, mutual \r\nunderstanding and better living conditions for all \r\npeoples. \r\n With those hopes in mind, I express to you, Sir, \r\nmy most sincere wishes for a successful presidency of \r\nthis greatest of world assemblies, and I assure you that \r\nyou can fully rely on our support throughout the sixty-\r\nsecond session. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of Government of \r\nthe Republic of San Marino for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\nMr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign and Political Affairs and \r\nEconomic Planning of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nImmigration of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. \r\n Mr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nYear after year the international community meets in \r\nNew York in September to debate the major issues of \r\nconcern to humankind. This traditional encounter is of \r\nspecial importance in that it enables us to grasp very \r\ndirectly and intensively, in all their complexity, the \r\nchallenges that confront us, but also to bolster our \r\ndetermination to search for common solutions. That is \r\nthe very essence of the effective multilateralism that, \r\nwith great conviction, my country, Luxembourg, has \r\nplaced at the heart of its international action. \r\n And what could be a stronger illustration of this \r\nshared perception of what is at stake globally and this \r\nresolve to seek viable solutions in the short, medium \r\nand long, even very long, term than the high-level \r\nevent organized at the beginning of the week at the \r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General devoted to the \r\nproblems of climate change? \r\n As already said on behalf of the European Union \r\nby the Prime Minister of Portugal (see A/62/PV.4), \r\nwhose statement I fully support, it is essential that \r\nDecember’s Bali negotiations on an effective and \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 10 \r\n \r\nviable post-Kyoto regime get off to a successful start. \r\nThat is our most basic responsibility vis-à-vis present \r\nand future generations. For its part, as a member of the \r\nEuropean Union and a State party to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, Luxembourg, which has already undertaken \r\nweighty individual commitments, is ready to engage \r\nwith great resolve in the quest for innovative and bold \r\nsolutions. \r\n In order to address successfully the problems of \r\nclimate change, we must tackle them in all their \r\ncomplexity. In this regard, it should be noted that in the \r\nabsence of concerted and energetic international action, \r\nthere is a great risk that countries and populations that \r\nhave contributed the least to the emergence of this \r\nphenomenon are likely to be the ones to bear the \r\nheaviest adverse consequences. \r\n This, as I see it, is a political problem — and, I \r\nwould say, a moral problem — of the first order. More \r\nthan ever, the issue of development and hence of \r\nsustainable development both in the North and in the \r\nSouth must remain in the forefront of international \r\nattention. Important decisions have already been taken. \r\nHere, I would refer in particular to the decision taken \r\nby the European Union in 2005 under the Luxembourg \r\npresidency to attain the objective of 0.7 per cent of \r\ngross national income for official development \r\nassistance (ODA) by 2015. Faced with the risk of \r\nstagnation in ODA, we must redouble our efforts to \r\nmeet our commitments. \r\n A member of this all-too select “0.7 Group” — \r\nwith ODA that in 2007 reached close to 0.9 per cent of \r\ngross national income, and looking forward to \r\nachieving the objective of 1 per cent that we have set \r\nfor ourselves — Luxembourg can only look forward to \r\nthe expansion of this club. \r\n The year that lies ahead is crucial from the \r\nstandpoint of development. There will be a need to \r\nundertake resolutely, and in a way that seeks a \r\nconvergence, the World Trade Organization trade \r\nnegotiations, the follow-up to Monterrey in the area of \r\nfinancing for development, and the implementation of \r\nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Only if we \r\nadopt generous and courageous policies will we be able \r\nto build on these advances and reduce the delays that \r\nunfortunately persist, particularly in a number of \r\nsub-Saharan African countries, with regard to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The convening in 2008 of a high-level meeting on \r\nmid-term implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals would undoubtedly be a good \r\nopportunity to take stock and relaunch our efforts. Here \r\nI would also applaud the recent establishment at the \r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Africa Steering Group. I am \r\nconvinced that this will make a significant contribution \r\nin terms of coordination and intensification of efforts \r\nvis-à-vis a continent with which Luxembourg \r\nmaintains relations of intense and multifaceted \r\ncooperation. \r\n The problems associated with climate change and \r\nsustainable development bring me to another subject \r\nthat is dear to my heart and is at the core of the \r\ninternational activities of the Luxembourg Government: \r\nhumanitarian action. When it first discussed the \r\nquestion of climate change (see S/PV.5663), the \r\nSecurity Council highlighted the numerous complex \r\ninteractions that could exist among natural disasters, \r\nthe stepping up of violent conflicts within and among \r\nStates and humanitarian disasters in various parts of \r\nthe world. We must tackle these emergency situations \r\non the operational level, seeking to make our action as \r\nefficient and prompt as possible. But there is also a \r\nneed increasingly to place these emergency situations \r\nin their political, socio-economic and cultural context \r\nin order to try to mitigate their effects and, as far as \r\npossible, to prevent recurrence. \r\n It is from this standpoint that a new Luxembourg \r\nGovernment strategy in the area of humanitarian crisis \r\nmanagement has recently been presented. The strategy \r\nthat rests on three pillars: emergency relief; \r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction in the transitional \r\nphase; and prevention. \r\n On the basis of the United Nations finding that \r\none euro invested in prevention may make it possible \r\nto save eight euros in crisis response and resolution, \r\nnearly 5 per cent of the Luxembourg humanitarian \r\nbudget will henceforth be devoted to a proactive, \r\npreventive approach. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome, which is more \r\nthan ever the road map for international action, \r\nstressed the fundamental finding according to which, \r\n“development, peace and security and human rights are \r\ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing” (resolution 60/1, \r\npara. 9). \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n11 07-52121 \r\n \r\n For my part, I believe that this is a cardinal \r\nprinciple that should guide and inspire all action by the \r\nUnited Nations and its Member States from an overall \r\nstandpoint of coherence in addressing the great \r\nproblems of the time: conflicts in Africa — and I am \r\nthinking particularly of the situations with tragic \r\nhumanitarian consequences currently prevailing in the \r\nSudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, and, to be sure, Zimbabwe; the Middle East, \r\nwhere it is important to support fully ongoing Israeli \r\nand Palestinian efforts and to progress ultimately \r\ntowards a negotiated solution of two States living side \r\nby side in peace and security, and also towards a \r\nlasting solution for the whole region; and Afghanistan, \r\nBurma/Myanmar and other hotbeds of violence and \r\ninstability. There is no denying that we must take into \r\naccount simultaneously the dimensions of peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights, States rights, the rule of law \r\nand socio-economic development. \r\n I would like now to speak of the courage of the \r\nBurmese monks and other citizens who for weeks have \r\nbeen peacefully expressing their aspiration to \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. I condemn \r\nmost energetically the violence of the Burmese security \r\nforces against these peaceful demonstrators and call the \r\nauthorities to put an end to it. \r\n The imperative that I mentioned a moment ago \r\ncan also be seen very clearly in the work of a new and \r\ninnovative organ, of which Luxembourg has been a \r\nmember since the beginning of the year: the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. The integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies for each of the countries \r\nconcerned should take into account all the factors \r\ninvolved in order once and for all to break the cycles of \r\nviolence and place those countries on a stable track \r\ntowards development. I would like also to mention in \r\nthis context the essential dimension of reconciliation \r\nand combating impunity and to applauding in \r\nparticular the activities of the various international \r\ncourts, in particular the International Criminal Court. \r\n The protection and promotion of human rights is \r\none of the key focuses of Luxembourg’s foreign policy. \r\nI continue to place great hope in the new Human \r\nRights Council, which has just finished setting up its \r\ninstitutional structures, including, in particular, the \r\nuniversal periodic review mechanism, which is a \r\nsignificant innovation. \r\n Faithful to its convictions and commitments, my \r\ncountry fully associates itself with the initiatives \r\nannounced by a group of States from all parts of the \r\nworld aimed at making progress in the international \r\ndebate on the question of abolishing the death penalty. \r\n In this rapid overview of the international \r\nsituation in the area of peace and security, allow me to \r\nlinger for a moment on an important issue that is of \r\nsuch concern to both the United Nations and the \r\nEuropean Union, namely Kosovo. The last act of the \r\nYugoslav tragedy, an urgent solution for the Kosovo \r\nissue must be found. The Special Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General, President Ahtisaari, has been \r\nworking energetically to establish, in keeping with the \r\nestablished guidelines, the basis of the future status of \r\nKosovo. The Troika of representatives from the \r\nEuropean Union, the United States and Russia is also \r\ncommitted to a final attempt to bring the two parties \r\ntogether. These efforts have been continued in recent \r\ndays in New York. As members know, the parties are \r\neven now meeting in this building; I have high hopes \r\nthat dialogue will ensue. The Troika has agreed to \r\nsubmit its report to the Secretary-General by \r\n10 December. I reiterate that the European Union is \r\nready to fully assume its responsibilities in the region, \r\nfor which a European future lies ahead. \r\n I turn my attention to another issue that is of \r\nconcern to international public opinion and whose \r\npotential impact on peace and security is very \r\nworrisome: the area of disarmament and nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation. A few days ago, I had the \r\nopportunity to state the views of the Luxembourg \r\nGovernment at the General Conference of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Here at \r\nthe General Assembly I advocate once again for \r\ncontinued efforts in the area of nuclear disarmament \r\nand a strengthening of the non-proliferation regime, of \r\nwhich the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons is and should remain the keystone. \r\nMr. Romero-Martínez (Honduras), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n I would also like to speak briefly about other \r\ntypes of arms with destabilizing effects or unacceptable \r\nconsequences for civilians; small arms and light \r\nweapons and sub-munitions. I hope that significant \r\nadvances may soon be made, on those two categories \r\nof weapons in particular. The Luxembourg Government \r\nfor its part intends to participate actively in this debate \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 12 \r\n \r\nand is currently preparing a bill forbidding the \r\nmanufacture, storage, utilization and trade in weapons \r\nemploying sub-munitions. \r\n The quest for international disarmament and the \r\nstrengthening of international regimes on weapons of \r\nmass destruction consistently remain objectives of the \r\nLuxembourg Government, because of the serious \r\nconcern we feel as we observe certain current \r\ndevelopments with regard to respect for existing \r\ninternational norms, in particular with reference to the \r\nIranian issue. \r\n While the agreement that has just been concluded \r\nbetween the secretariat of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency — specifically Mr. ElBaradei — and \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran goes in the right direction, \r\nwe note with concern that Iran has not yet taken the \r\nnecessary measures to bring itself into conformity with \r\nthe three relevant resolutions of the Security Council. I \r\nappeal to Iran finally to take that action and to suspend \r\nall activities linked to enrichment. \r\n On the set of issues that I have just mentioned, \r\nthe Charter has entrusted a central role to the Security \r\nCouncil. It is essential for the Council to adapt to the \r\npolitical realities of the beginning of the twenty-first \r\ncentury by enlarging its membership in the categories \r\nof permanent and non-permanent members, \r\nguaranteeing an appropriate place for the small States \r\nthat represent the vast majority of States Members of \r\nthe Organization. It is important also to modernize the \r\nCouncil’s functioning for the sake of enhanced \r\neffectiveness and transparency, with broader \r\ninvolvement for the entire membership. On the basis of \r\nthe consensus decision that was adopted at the end of \r\nthe sixty-first session of the General Assembly (see \r\nA/61/PV.109), I venture to hope that significant \r\nprogress will be achieved in the area of Security \r\nCouncil reform in months to come. My country is \r\neager to make its contribution to the achievement of \r\nthe purposes of the Charter and to shoulder its share of \r\nresponsibility in international peace and security, and \r\nthus wishes to become — for the first time since it \r\nplaced its signature on the San Francisco Charter in \r\n1945 — a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil for 2013 and 2014. \r\n Security Council reform is an important portion \r\nof the United Nations reform agenda outlined at the \r\n2005 Summit. If recourse to a multilateral machinery, \r\nwith the United Nations at its core, is to be credible, \r\nthen the tool made available to the international \r\ncommunity must be commensurate with the \r\ndevelopments of our time and capable of responding \r\nadequately to the expectations of efficiency and \r\neffectiveness harboured by States and peoples \r\nworldwide. \r\n The reform effort should be pursued and \r\nsupported with conviction by a revitalized General \r\nAssembly, exercising its prerogatives with energy and \r\ndiscernment and achieving its priority objectives. \r\nReform, and thus the modernization of multilateralism, \r\ncan succeed only if it rests on the common will of all \r\nMember States. \r\n That applies in particular to the field of system-\r\nwide coherence in operational activities. To overcome \r\nthe fragmentation that has developed over more than \r\n60 years of United Nations history, to restore to the \r\nsystem and its actors a more effective capacity for \r\naction, particularly at the level of the countries and \r\npopulations concerned, and to strengthen operational \r\ncoherence in the eight areas covered by the report of \r\nthe High-level Panel (A/61/583) are primary objectives \r\nfor the performance and thus the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations system. They are also decisions that \r\nneed to be taken courageously and proactively in the \r\nappropriate forums. \r\n While the success of reform would be reflected in \r\na win-win-win situation for donor countries, recipient \r\ncountries and the United Nations as a whole, as \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon has rightly said, the failure of reform \r\nwould be likely to marginalize the entire system over \r\nthe long term. The choice is before us; we must \r\nshoulder our political responsibilities. \r\n More than ever, effective multilateralism is a \r\ngreat hope of our populations aspiring to a more just, \r\nmore peaceful and more prosperous world, where the \r\ngreat ecological balance is preserved and where every \r\nman and every woman can live in dignity and in full \r\nenjoyment of his or her human rights. Let us not \r\ndisappoint that expectation.  \r\n And let us remember this very wise saying from \r\nthe Roman philosopher Seneca: It is not because it is \r\ndifficult that we do not dare to do it; it is because we \r\ndo not dare to do it that it is difficult. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Abdelwaheb \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n13 07-52121 \r\n \r\nAbdallah, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Tunisia.  \r\n Mr. Abdallah (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express to His Excellency \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim and to his friendly country our most \r\nsincere congratulations on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We \r\nare confident that under his skilful and effective \r\nleadership, our deliberations will be successful.  \r\n I wish also to extend to our sister, Her Excellency \r\nMs. Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, our deep thanks \r\nand appreciation for her valuable efforts as President of \r\nthe Assembly at its previous session towards the \r\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals and \r\ntowards enhancing dialogue among all members of the \r\ninternational community and reviving the Security \r\nCouncil reform process.  \r\n I wish also to express our appreciation to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his endeavours and \r\nhis determination to reform the functioning of the \r\nOrganization. We wish him every success.  \r\n Signs of new dynamism in the United Nations \r\nreform process reflect a true desire to improve the \r\nOrganization’s work so as to bring it in line with the \r\nrequirements of the new world realities and with new \r\nconcepts arising from the profound and speedy \r\ntransformations the world has experienced in recent \r\ndecades.  \r\n In our view, giving effect to that desire requires \r\nnew working frameworks and mechanisms to reinforce \r\nthe underpinnings of international peace and security \r\nand enable us to achieve collective solutions to the \r\ncommon challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity. We should be inspired in that endeavour by \r\na new vision that lays the foundation for a \r\ncomprehensive, effective and solidarity-based global \r\npartnership among the members of the international \r\ncommunity, on the basis of constructive dialogue \r\namong peoples, cultures, civilizations and religions.  \r\n On the basis of that conviction, Tunisia has \r\nlaunched international initiatives with political, \r\nhumanitarian and social dimensions. Some of these \r\ninitiatives were adopted by the United Nations, such as \r\nthe establishment of the World Solidarity Fund. We \r\nlook forward to increased efforts by the international \r\ncommunity to operationalize the Fund.  \r\n The President returned to the Chair.  \r\n Since the early 1990s, Tunisia has been in the \r\nforefront of countries drawing attention to the dangers \r\nof terrorism and its negative impact on world security \r\nand stability. Today, Tunisia renews its call for an \r\ninternational conference, under United Nations \r\nauspices, in order to formulate an international code of \r\nconduct for combating terrorism, by which all parties \r\nwould abide.  \r\n Convinced of the significant role that dialogue \r\namong civilizations plays in obviating the dangers of \r\nextremism and intolerance, Tunisia has consistently \r\nendeavoured to be the world capital of dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, by hosting several regional and \r\ninternational conferences and seminars. It has also \r\ntaken initiatives in this field, such as the publication of \r\nthe Carthage Charter for Tolerance in 1995, the appeal \r\nby President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for a pedagogy of \r\ntolerance, the 2001 Tunis Declaration on Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations, and the establishment, in the \r\nUniversity of Tunis, of the Ben Ali Chair for Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations and Religions.  \r\n We take note with satisfaction of the focus on the \r\ntheme of climate change during the current session’s \r\ngeneral debate, in view of the fact that environmental \r\nissues are a basic pillar of sustainable development and \r\none of the major elements of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals — one that has an impact on \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n Tunisia believes that climate change poses a \r\ncommon threat to all States of the world without \r\nexception. This has prompted Tunisia to host, next \r\nNovember, an international ministerial workshop to \r\ndiscuss climate change in Africa and the Mediterranean \r\nregion, as a contribution to increasing and deepening \r\nawareness of the importance of this issue and to \r\nenriching regional dialogue on it.  \r\n The international community and all its members \r\nmust devote more attention to the environment and to \r\nfinding urgent and effective collective solutions to \r\nenvironmental issues in certain regions of the world — \r\nnotably in Africa, which suffers most from the climate \r\nchange that is threatening the continent’s aspirations to \r\ndevelopment and to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.  \r\n The fact that several important international \r\npolitical problems remain unsolved continues to be a \r\nsource of concern for us. Today, Tunisia reaffirms that \r\nit upholds the values of peace and justice and the \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 14 \r\n \r\nprinciples of international legitimacy, and that it is \r\nprepared to contribute to the dissemination and \r\npromotion of the values of tolerance, moderation and \r\nmutual respect among nations and peoples. In our view, \r\nthat should help consolidate a constructive dialogue \r\namong civilizations and establish international \r\ncooperation and a solidarity-based development \r\npartnership that will help eliminate the causes of \r\ntension and conflict worldwide.  \r\n On this occasion, we reaffirm our principled and \r\nconstant support for the Palestinian people in their \r\nstruggle for their just cause. We urge the international \r\ncommunity, in particular the influential parties and the \r\nQuartet, to intensify their efforts aimed at reviving the \r\npeace process, on the basis of United Nations \r\nresolutions and the relevant Arab and international \r\nterms of reference, inter alia, the Arab Peace Initiative, \r\nwith a view to finding a just and comprehensive \r\nsolution that would guarantee the restoration of the \r\nPalestinians’ legitimate rights, foremost among which \r\nis the establishment of their own independent State.  \r\n We welcome the initiative taken by President \r\nBush and certain international influential parties to \r\nrevive the peace process. In this context, we wish to \r\nstress the importance of convening an international \r\npeace conference that should yield concrete proposals \r\nfor achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace in the \r\nMiddle East and lead to the restitution of all occupied \r\nArab territories and guarantee security and stability to \r\nall the countries and peoples of the region.  \r\n By the same token, we call for concerted regional \r\nand international efforts to help the brotherly Iraqi \r\npeople to restore the deteriorating security, economic \r\nand humanitarian situation in their country, through the \r\nachievement of a consensual political settlement \r\namong all its segments and factions that preserves the \r\nunity and sovereignty of Iraq. As far as the situation in \r\nLebanon is concerned, we urge all Lebanese parties to \r\nfavour dialogue as the sole way to prevent the scourge \r\nof dissension among the Lebanese people and to \r\nrestore confidence and reconciliation among them.  \r\n Since 7 November 1987, Tunisia, under the \r\nleadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, has \r\nsucceeded in making pioneer achievements and gains \r\nin different fields. This has been made possible thanks \r\nto comprehensive reforms that allowed Tunisia to \r\nconsolidate the rule of law and institutions, as well as \r\npublic freedoms, and to disseminate, in theory and \r\npractice, the culture of human rights, thus enhancing \r\nthe democratic structure of the country and paving the \r\nway for contributions by all components of civil \r\nsociety to define national orientations and choices for \r\nthe future.  \r\n The reform process implemented in Tunisia has \r\nallowed the achievement of numerous Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which has translated into better \r\nliving standards for Tunisians and well-being for all \r\nsegments of Tunisian society. This reflects the \r\ncorrectness of development choices made by Tunisia, \r\nwhich has also allowed it to hold an advanced position \r\namong countries with the highest level of human \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n On many occasions, Tunisia has stated its \r\nconviction of the need for building international \r\ncooperation and partnerships based on a \r\ncomprehensive approach aimed at achieving \r\ndevelopment for all and laying the foundations for \r\nconstructive relations among countries of the North \r\nand the South. In this context, President Zine \r\nEl Abidine Ben Ali called from this rostrum in 1989 for \r\nthe adoption of a charter of peace and progress \r\nbetween the countries of the North and the South.  \r\n The international community is called upon to \r\nexert more efforts to enable all the peoples of the \r\nworld, particularly the least developed countries, to \r\nbenefit from the digital revolution and to acquire \r\nknowledge. This will require operationalizing and \r\nimplementing the recommendations and resolutions \r\nmade by international conferences in our country in \r\nNovember 2005 to contribute to the building of a \r\nglobal, more equitable and solidarity-based \r\ninformation society.  \r\n The integration of Tunisia in its regional and \r\ninternational environment is one of the priorities of its \r\nforeign policy, which endeavours to enhance political \r\nrelations with brotherly and friendly nations as well \r\nwith regional and international organizations. Tunisia \r\nlooks forward to the broadening and diversification of \r\nthe scope of its cooperation with all its partners in \r\norder to bring it to the level of an efficient partnership \r\nbased on mutual respect and common interest. Hence, \r\nTunisia is constantly striving, with its brotherly \r\nMaghrebian countries, to complete the formation of the \r\nMaghreb Arab Union and to consolidate its structures \r\nand institutions in order to reinforce integration and \r\ncomplementarity among the peoples of the region.  \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n15 07-52121 \r\n \r\n Tunisia has equally sought to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of Arab common action. It seeks to \r\nupgrade its interaction with the changes and challenges \r\nconfronting the region and to further the process of \r\nreform and modernization in this field, in conformity \r\nwith the decisions and recommendations of the Tunis \r\nSummit, the Algiers Summit and the Riyadh Summit.  \r\n On the other hand, Tunisia, being a member of \r\nArab committees entrusted with Palestinian, Lebanese \r\nand other issues, is participating effectively in the work \r\nof those committees for the benefit of Arab causes.  \r\n As far as Africa is concerned, Tunisia has \r\nenhanced its relations with African countries and has \r\nstrengthened cooperation with them. It has made active \r\nefforts to contribute effectively to the process of \r\nbuilding the structures and institutions of the African \r\nUnion and to the consolidation of the fundamentals of \r\npeace, security and stability in the continent and \r\nopening promising new horizons for development in \r\norder to further enhance integration among its peoples.  \r\n In view of the strategic importance of its relations \r\nwith the European Union, Tunisia has been constantly \r\nseeking to advance those ties and to broaden their \r\nscope, so as to cover all fields of cooperation with the \r\naim of building a solidarity-based partnership with \r\nEuropean Union countries based on mutual respect and \r\ncommon interest.  \r\n Tunisia also endeavours to strengthen the \r\nEuro-Mediterranean cooperation process. In this \r\nconnection, Tunisia has welcomed the initiative \r\nlaunched by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France for \r\nestablishing a Mediterranean Union. Tunisia has \r\nfurther expressed its readiness to contribute to and \r\nparticipate in shaping the content of such a union and \r\nin defining its objectives.  \r\n Since the establishment of the United Nations, \r\nTunisia has expressed constant faith in the noble \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Organization. It has \r\nalways been committed to lending its support to efforts \r\naimed at creating favourable conditions for appropriate \r\ncollective responses to global common challenges and \r\nfor solving the various problems that are a source of \r\nconcern to the world, as well as establishing solidarity-\r\nbased cooperation and partnership among all \r\ncomponents of the international community.  \r\n From this perspective, Tunisia, which will assume \r\nchairmanship of the next session of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament, is determined to work, in coordination \r\nwith Member States, for the achievement of tangible \r\nprogress regarding issues on the agenda of the \r\nConference. In so doing, Tunisia will seek to enhance \r\nconstructive and positive dialogue on those issues in \r\norder to achieve the objectives of the Conference and \r\nto contribute to the consolidation of peace and security \r\nin the world and to the dissemination of a global \r\nculture of peace, thus consecrating the noble values \r\nand principles for which our Organization has been \r\ncreated.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Russian Federation.  \r\n Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Traditionally, the General Assembly sums up \r\nthe results of the ending political year. This requires \r\nserious and joint consideration. It is essential to \r\nidentify agreed solutions for today’s global problems \r\nbased on the collective analysis of current international \r\naffairs. It appears that no one is challenging that \r\nsecurity and prosperity are inseparable in an \r\nincreasingly globalized world. Our approach should be \r\nsimilarly comprehensive, taking into account the \r\ninseparable link between the issues of peace and \r\ndevelopment, which has been amply proven by our \r\nrecent experience.  \r\n The expanding range of conflicts in international \r\npolitics through the exacerbation of regional crises, the \r\nincreasing threat of terrorism, the risk of the spread of \r\nweapons of mass destruction and stagnation on \r\ndisarmament jeopardize international stability, divert \r\nresources from constructive uses and undermines the \r\npotential for sustainable worldwide economic growth. \r\nAnd it is such growth that is our common fundamental \r\ngoal. Poverty and economic backwardness expand the \r\nbreeding ground for extremism.  \r\n On the other hand, developments over the past \r\nyear provide convincing proof that an essentially new \r\ngeopolitical situation has been developing in the world, \r\none that is defined primarily by emerging multipolarity. \r\nWe need to agree on what inferences we can draw from \r\nthis. In his Munich speech in February, President \r\nVladimir Putin of the Russian Federation called for an \r\nopen and sincere dialogue that would enable us to work \r\nout a common understanding of the current historical \r\nepoch and of the modus operandi it obliges our nations \r\nto adopt.  \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 16 \r\n \r\n The international landscape is changing, due to \r\nnewly emerging centres of global growth. Today, \r\nnobody can cope with global challenges single-\r\nhandedly. Neither diktat nor bipolar dominance can \r\nfulfil the task of world governance. What is needed is \r\ncollective leadership by major States; this should be \r\nrepresentative both geographically and in terms of \r\ncivilizations. The basis for such an informal \r\nmechanism can be provided only by the United Nations \r\nwith its unique legitimacy.  \r\n Multilateral diplomacy based on international law \r\nhas come to the fore. Like any society of free people, a \r\nworld of free nations needs universal regulatory \r\nprinciples to ensure predictability and confidence in \r\ninternational affairs. The way to achieve this goal lies \r\nthrough strengthening the United Nations system by \r\nfurther adapting it to modern global realities. Decisions \r\nhere should be based on the broadest possible \r\nconsensus among Member States and on the universal \r\nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations. It is \r\nfrom that perspective that we view the reform \r\ninitiatives proposed by Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon.  \r\n It will be in our common interest to make more \r\nactive use of United Nations peacekeeping capabilities. \r\nThese could be improved by more effective use of a \r\nbody such as the Military Staff Committee. The \r\ninitiative put forward by the President of Russia in \r\n2000 to enhance the work of the Military Staff \r\nCommittee remains relevant. Naturally, a renewed \r\nCommittee should operate with the participation of all \r\nmembers of the Security Council, as provided for in \r\nthe United Nations Charter.  \r\n Much remains to be done also in improving the \r\ninteraction of the United Nations with regional \r\norganizations that have proven their ability to \r\neffectively participate in resolving security and \r\ndevelopment issues. A positive interrelationship \r\nbetween the principles of multilateralism and \r\nregionalism is obviously very important. At present, \r\nmore than 50 per cent of international trade is carried \r\nout under regional trade agreements. Global trade \r\nregulation mechanisms cannot be effective without \r\nregional integration, which is key to the economic \r\nwell-being of all the regions of the world.  \r\n Russia is actively signing and using regional \r\ntrade agreements to achieve mutual liberalization of \r\ntrade. Russia intends to use its current chairmanship of \r\nthe Eurasian Economic Community to give a more \r\npractical focus to the organization, which since 2003 \r\nhas had observer status in the General Assembly. \r\nRussia, along with other sponsors, will submit to the \r\nGeneral Assembly a draft resolution on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Eurasian \r\nEconomic Community, aimed at providing a more \r\nsystemic basis and facilitating the timely realization of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We also hope that \r\nUnited Nations Member States would honour the \r\nEurasian Development Bank the status of observer in \r\nthe General Assembly. We shall actively promote the \r\nattainment of these objectives, including in the \r\nframework of the process to reinvigorate the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States and build up \r\nstrategic offensive capabilities.  \r\n The international community’s efforts should \r\nremain focused on reaching the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We are concerned that today, \r\nseven years since the Millennium Summit, many \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed \r\ncountries, are still significantly behind schedule in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nParticular attention should be paid to the specific needs \r\nof the African continent.  \r\n Russia fully shares the principles of global \r\npartnership in the interest of development, as approved \r\nat the Monterrey International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development and intends to increase its \r\ninput to our common efforts in that area. We shall \r\nconsistently strengthen our position as a donor country \r\nin accordance with the approach to Russian \r\nparticipation in international development assistance \r\napproved by President Putin in June 2007.  \r\n We are confident that concrete steps to ensure \r\nsustainable socio-economic development in all regions \r\nare a sure remedy against threats to peace and security.  \r\n There is a pressing need to use any means \r\navailable to strengthen the leading role of the United \r\nNations in fighting terrorism. Here, the Organization’s \r\nactivities should be based on a comprehensive \r\nframework, including the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy adopted last year as \r\nresolution 60/288, and on a comprehensive convention \r\non international terrorism. The Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization is contributing to these efforts and \r\nhas established useful interaction with the United \r\nNations.  \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n17 07-52121 \r\n \r\n Our efforts to resolve regional conflicts and \r\nurgent social and economic problems should form part \r\nof our counter-terrorism efforts.  \r\n Iraq has become a source of destabilization for \r\nthe whole region. Ensuring security, not to mention \r\neconomic development, in that country requires a new \r\nstrategy focused on reaching genuine national \r\nreconciliation with the participation of all of Iraq’s \r\nneighbours and with the support of the international \r\ncommunity. We call upon the Secretary-General to take \r\nan active role in this issue, given the additional power \r\nthe United Nations can wield towards an Iraqi \r\nsettlement. The participants in recent multilateral \r\nmeetings on Iraq have upheld that approach, and we \r\nsupport the decision endorsed at those meetings.  \r\n The indivisibility of security is to be seen clearly \r\nin the Middle East. Early solution of the Palestine \r\nproblem based on the two-State concept and the \r\nachievement of a comprehensive Middle East \r\nsettlement underpinned by the international legal \r\nplatform developed by the United Nations are next on \r\nthe agenda. We are convinced that this goal could be \r\nadvanced by holding a representative international \r\nconference preceded by thorough preparation. We \r\nconsider the United States initiative to convene in \r\nNovember a multiparty meeting on a Middle East \r\nsettlement as a step in that direction. We appreciate the \r\npreliminary considerations voiced by the United States \r\nside regarding the agenda and composition of that \r\nevent. We reaffirm the importance of involving the \r\nQuartet of international mediators and the Arab League \r\nin the preparations.  \r\n Settlement of the Kosovo problem is only \r\npossible within the framework of international and law \r\nbased on negotiations. Unilateral steps will not lead to \r\na lasting peace and will create the risk of \r\ndestabilization in the Balkans and other regions.  \r\n Complex problems require an integrated \r\napproach. This is particularly true for the situation \r\naround Iran. The goal of nuclear non-proliferation is an \r\nabsolute priority. At the same time, we should not \r\nignore the task of engaging Iran in constructive efforts \r\nto resolve regional and international issues.  \r\n Urgent steps are needed to strengthen the \r\nnon-proliferation regime while providing all States \r\nwith legitimate access to the benefits of the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy. The joint initiative of the \r\nPresidents of Russia and the United States, put forward \r\nat their Kennebunkport meeting, is aimed at starting \r\njoint practical work in this field.  \r\n We are confident that today peace should be \r\nbased on willingness to cooperate, especially on \r\nmatters directly affecting strategic stability. In this \r\ncontext, we cannot neglect the unilateral plans in the \r\narea of missile defence. President Putin has proposed a \r\nconstructive alternative: collaborative work with the \r\nparticipation of Russia, the United States and Europe, \r\nand subsequently with that of other countries. Such \r\nwork could lead to a genuinely global strategic alliance \r\nencompassing the entire Euro-Atlantic region, which \r\nwould allow us to move forward in establishing an \r\nopen system of collective security. Our proposals are \r\nunder discussion, and we hope that the collective \r\napproach will prevail. \r\n The principle of the indivisibility of security \r\nshould form the basis for resolving the situation around \r\nthe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. \r\nRussia stands ready to engage in that process, and \r\nproposals are well known. We expect that these \r\nproposals will be seriously discussed during the \r\nupcoming consultations. \r\n The possibility of deploying weapons in outer \r\nspace poses a serious threat. The magnitude of that \r\nthreat is determined by the global coverage of the \r\ndeployment, which can endanger all States without \r\nexception. We consistently oppose the deployment in \r\nspace of weapons of any type, and we call upon the \r\ninternational community to conclude an agreement to \r\nthat effect. \r\n Another outstanding global issue is the effective \r\nprevention of climate change, which requires agreed \r\nand scientifically based solutions that are realistic and \r\nbalanced and that do not undercut countries’ right to \r\ndevelopment. Russia has always stood for a \r\nconstructive dialogue with a view to giving a genuinely \r\nuniversal character to the international climate \r\nprotection regime. We hope that the important meetings \r\nthat took place this week in New York and Washington \r\nwill facilitate thorough preparations for a successful \r\nlaunch in December in Bali of negotiations on joint \r\npost-2012 efforts. \r\n The spiritual and moral foundations of human \r\nsolidarity are of increasingly vital importance. The \r\nspiritual values of all world religions demand that we \r\nachieve intercivilizational accord and fight \r\nmanifestations of xenophobia and racism, as well as \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 18 \r\n \r\nthe resurgence of neo-Nazi trends. Those are the tasks \r\nto be tackled within the framework of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, which we support.  The World Summit of \r\nReligious Leaders held in Moscow last year added a \r\nnew dimension to this endeavour. We propose to build \r\nupon the results of the Summit and to think about \r\nestablishing, under United Nations auspices, a special \r\nforum — a kind of consultative council of religions — \r\nfor exchanges of views among representatives of major \r\nworld faiths. \r\n Russia will spare no effort to strengthen \r\nmultilateral cooperation within the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations. I am convinced that with a continued \r\ncommitment to the principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter, we can make progress in the creation of an \r\neffective system of collective security, as was the will \r\nof the founding fathers of the world Organization. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Yang Jiechi, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the People’s Republic of China. \r\n Mr. Yang Jiechi (China) (spoke in Chinese): I \r\nwish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. I am convinced that under your able \r\nleadership, the current session will be a fruitful one. I \r\nalso wish to thank Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for \r\nher contribution during her presidency of the previous \r\nsession. \r\n The current international environment is highly \r\ncomplex. Mankind is facing both unprecedented \r\nopportunities and challenges. There is a growing trend \r\ntowards peace, development and cooperation in the \r\nworld. But, on the other hand, traditional and non-\r\ntraditional security threats are intertwined; hotspot \r\nissues are acute; the gap between the North and South \r\nis widening; trade protectionism is resurfacing; and \r\ndeveloping countries generally remain in a \r\ndisadvantaged position. The steady trend towards \r\neconomic globalization and towards a multi-polar \r\nworld is fostering a new way of thinking about \r\ninternational relations. \r\n In this Hall two years ago, Chinese President Hu \r\nJintao called on mankind to build a harmonious world \r\nwith lasting peace and common prosperity in the \r\ntwenty-first century (see A/60/PV.5). The core message \r\nof his call is that, while recognizing the diversity of the \r\nworld, differences of interests and diversity of cultures, \r\nwe should harmonize interests, defuse conflicts and \r\npromote cooperation for win-win progress in a \r\npeaceful and cooperative manner. \r\n In its 62-year history, the United Nations has \r\nplayed an irreplaceable role in promoting humankind’s \r\ncause of peace and development. The current session of \r\nthe General Assembly should focus on promoting \r\nharmonious coexistence among countries. Resolving \r\nhotspot issues and peacefully settling international \r\ndisputes through dialogue and cooperation are not only \r\nexplicitly called for by the United Nations Charter. \r\nThey are also the right way to uphold world peace and \r\nstability and achieve mutual benefit and a win-win \r\nsituation for all. \r\n China remains committed to seeking a peaceful \r\nsolution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula \r\nthrough dialogue to uphold peace and stability on the \r\npeninsula and throughout North-East Asia. The Six-\r\nParty Talks have become an important platform for the \r\nparties concerned to maintain dialogue and \r\nconsultations on achieving denuclearization on the \r\npeninsula, normalizing relations between the countries \r\nconcerned and building a new harmonious architecture \r\nin North-East Asia. We will continue to play a \r\nconstructive role in advancing the process of the Six-\r\nParty Talks and the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula. \r\n Diplomatic negotiations are the best option for \r\nresolving the Iranian nuclear issue peacefully and \r\nmeeting the common interests of the international \r\ncommunity. China opposes nuclear-weapon \r\nproliferation and stands for upholding the international \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and peace and \r\nstability in the Middle East. No non-proliferation effort \r\nshould deviate from the goal of upholding international \r\npeace and stability. Countries should honour their due \r\ninternational obligations, and their right to peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy should be fully respected. China \r\nurges the parties concerned to show flexibility and \r\nresume negotiations at an early date. China will \r\ncontinue to contribute its share to the peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Iranian nuclear issue. \r\n The Palestine-Israel conflict is at the core of the \r\nMiddle East issue. China supports the just cause of the \r\nPalestinian and other Arab peoples and the restoration \r\nof their lawful national rights, and it sincerely hopes \r\nthat Arab countries and Israel will promptly end their \r\ndisputes through political negotiations on the basis of \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions and the principle of \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n19 07-52121 \r\n \r\nland for peace. China calls on Palestine to strengthen \r\nits unity and welcomes the initiative to hold an \r\ninternational conference on the Middle East. We hope \r\nthat the Iraqi people will continue to work for national \r\nreconciliation and restore peace and stability at an \r\nearly date, and that this will lead to a comprehensive, \r\njust and lasting resolution of the Middle East issue. \r\n The trilateral dialogue and consultation among \r\nthe United Nations, the African Union and the \r\nSudanese Government on an equal footing is an \r\neffective mechanism for resolving the Darfur issue. \r\nThe international community should work to sustain \r\nthe current sound momentum and give full play to the \r\nrole of the trilateral mechanism as the main channel. \r\nWe should adhere to dual-track strategy, promote \r\nbalanced progress in peacekeeping operations and the \r\npolitical process and seek a lasting solution to the \r\nDarfur issue through making progress in the security, \r\npolitical, humanitarian, economic and social areas. \r\nChina is committed to a proper settlement of the Darfur \r\nissue. It has provided humanitarian assistance to Darfur \r\non a number of occasions and will send a military \r\nengineering unit to join the peacekeeping operations \r\nthere. China will continue to firmly support the peace \r\nand national reconciliation process in the Sudan and \r\nwill contribute to the resolution of the Darfur issue and \r\npeace, stability and development in the Sudan. \r\n At its current session, the General Assembly \r\nshould promote the peaceful development of all \r\ncountries. Poverty is a major source of disputes, and \r\nonly development can eliminate poverty. Human \r\ndevelopment concerns us all. Obviously, it is \r\nimpossible to build common prosperity when there is a \r\nhuge chasm between the North and the South. The \r\ninternational community should act with a sense of \r\nurgency and redouble its efforts to deliver the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, narrow the North-\r\nSouth gap and, in particular, meet Africa’s special \r\ndevelopment needs. Developed countries should \r\nincrease assistance, further open their domestic \r\nmarkets, transfer more technologies to developing \r\ncountries and provide greater debt relief to them. \r\n For their part, developing countries, on their part, \r\nshould adopt development strategies and policies \r\nsuited to their national conditions and boost their \r\neconomic development. We should support an open, \r\nequitable and fair multilateral trade regime and oppose \r\ntrade protectionism. We should work for an early, \r\ncomprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha \r\nRound negotiations and make it a development round. \r\nReform of the international economic system should \r\nfully reflect changes in the world economy and should \r\ngive developing countries more say and greater \r\nrepresentation in the international economic system. \r\n China gives a high priority to strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation on development as it \r\ndevelops itself. We seek coordinated and balanced \r\nglobal development. While a developing country itself, \r\nChina has all along provided assistance to African \r\ncountries and other developing countries, according to \r\nits ability, and has helped them to improve their \r\ncapacity for independent and sustainable development. \r\nThat is because we believe that lasting peace and the \r\ncommon prosperity of the world is possible only with \r\nthe development of developing countries. \r\n To help Africa attain stability, security and \r\nsustainable development is the common responsibility \r\nof the international community. China and African \r\ncountries enjoy mutual political respect and equality \r\nand economic mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. \r\nThey support one another and maintain close \r\nconsultation in international affairs. We draw on one \r\nanother’s strengths in governance to promote \r\ndevelopment. Thanks to our joint efforts, China-Africa \r\ncooperation has yielded fruitful results. Such \r\ncooperation is well received by the African countries, \r\nand it has brought great benefits to both the Chinese \r\nand African peoples. China’s cooperation with Africa \r\nfacilitates Africa’s cooperation with other countries and \r\nis not targeted against any third party. \r\n The current session of the General Assembly \r\nshould be devoted to promoting harmony between man \r\nand nature. Development in the world has both \r\nadvanced material progress and caused ecological \r\nimbalance and environmental pollution. To protect our \r\ncommon homeland is a matter of vital importance for \r\nour common future. \r\n Climate change is an environmental issue, but \r\nultimately it is an issue of development. It has arisen in \r\nthe course of development and can be resolved only \r\nthrough development. We should uphold the \r\nframework of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \r\nand adhere to the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. Developed countries \r\nshould face up to their responsibilities, fulfil their \r\ncommitments on emissions reduction in earnest and \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 20 \r\n \r\ncontinue to take the lead in emissions reduction after \r\n2012. We should strengthen international cooperation \r\non energy, resources and the environment, step up \r\nefforts to develop and introduce energy-conserving \r\ntechnologies, environmental protection technologies \r\nand low-carbon energy technologies, and establish \r\nreasonable mechanisms for financing and technology \r\ntransfer. That will enable developing countries to gain \r\naccess to and afford advanced environmental-\r\nprotection technologies, enhance capacity to respond to \r\nclimate change and effectively address climate change \r\nthrough achieving sustainable development. \r\n China takes climate change seriously. Though its \r\ncurrent per capita carbon dioxide emissions are less \r\nthan one third of the average of developed countries, \r\nChina, acting in a way that is highly responsible to \r\nmankind, has taken many effective measures to tackle \r\nclimate change, including adopting a series of laws and \r\nregulations and setting the goals of reducing energy \r\nintensity and increasing forest cover. The Chinese \r\nGovernment has set the following targets: to reduce \r\nenergy intensity and total discharge of major pollutants \r\nby about 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively and \r\nto increase the forest cover rate to 20 per cent for the \r\nperiod between the end of 2005 and 2010. Under its \r\nNational Climate Change Programme, China will take \r\nan active part in international cooperation in climate \r\nchange and contribute its share to protecting the global \r\nclimate. \r\n Advancing United Nations reform and enabling \r\nthe Organization to play a more important role in \r\nmaintaining world peace, promoting common \r\ndevelopment and strengthening cooperation among \r\ncountries is crucial to building a harmonious world. \r\nChina supports the reform of the United Nations. The \r\nreform decisions made at the high-level meeting \r\nmarking the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nheld in 2005 should be implemented in a \r\ncomprehensive and balanced manner. Priority should \r\nbe given to reform in the area of development, and the \r\nUnited Nations should increase its input in that area. \r\nThe Human Rights Council should build on the \r\noutcome of reform in its previous phase and become a \r\nplatform for dialogue and cooperation rather than an \r\narena for political confrontation. Security Council \r\nreform should give priority to increasing the \r\nrepresentation of developing countries and give small \r\nand medium-sized countries more opportunities to \r\nparticipate in decision-making. Reform proposals \r\nshould be based on the widest possible consensus. \r\nChina is ready to work with all other parties to turn \r\nreform into a process of strengthening consultation and \r\ndialogue and promoting solidarity and cooperation \r\namong all United Nations Member States. \r\n China is committed to building a society of \r\ndemocracy, the rule of law, equity and justice, integrity \r\nand amity, vitality, stability and order, where people \r\nlive in harmony with nature. To achieve that goal, \r\nChina is fully implementing the outcomes of scientific \r\nthinking on development. We are working to boost \r\nsocial productivity and ensure people’s rights in the \r\npolitical, economic, cultural, social and other fields. By \r\nstriving to build a harmonious society and by \r\nimproving the material and cultural life of one fifth of \r\nthe world’s population, China is making a true \r\ncontribution to the building of a harmonious world. \r\n China has always pursued its own development as \r\na part of the global effort to promote the common \r\nprogress of mankind. In international affairs, we are \r\ncommitted to the following goals: promoting \r\nparticipation in international affairs by all countries on \r\nan equal footing and democracy in international \r\nrelations; enabling all countries to share the benefits of \r\neconomic globalization and progress in science and \r\ntechnology for a win-win outcome; promoting \r\nexchanges and understanding among civilizations and \r\ndiversity in the world; enhancing dialogue and trust \r\namong countries; and jointly tackling global issues. \r\nChina unswervingly pursues a path of peaceful \r\ndevelopment and will continue to make further \r\ncontributions to humankind’s cause of peace and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. \r\nWe will not permit any challenge to the one-China \r\nprinciple and General Assembly resolution 2758 \r\n(XXVI). For 15 years running, since 1993, the General \r\nAssembly has rejected the inclusion of Taiwan-related \r\nissues in the agenda of the General Assembly session. \r\nThis fully demonstrates that any move that runs \r\ncounter to the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter or attempts to distort and deny General \r\nAssembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) will not receive any \r\nsupport from the United Nations Member States and is \r\ndoomed to failure. We hope that the countries \r\nconcerned will not allow themselves to be manipulated \r\nby the Taiwan authorities and will stop making wrong \r\nmoves of this kind. \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n21 07-52121 \r\n \r\n The Taiwan authorities are now obstinately \r\nclinging to the separatist course of “Taiwan \r\nindependence” and are trying by all means to secure a \r\nreferendum on applying for membership of the United \r\nNations under the name Taiwan. This is another \r\ndangerous step towards “de jure Taiwan independence” \r\ntaken by the Chen Shui-bian authorities. If unchecked, \r\nthis move will gravely endanger peace and stability \r\nacross the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\nThe Chinese Government has always made every effort \r\nto promote with all sincerity peaceful development of \r\ncross-Strait relations and to seek peaceful \r\nreunification. However, we will never allow anyone to \r\nseparate Taiwan from China in name or in any other \r\nway. We hope that the international community will \r\ncontinue to support China’s cause of peaceful \r\nreunification, support the Chinese people in opposing \r\nand repulsing separatist activities for “Taiwan \r\nindependence” and work with us to maintain peace and \r\nstability across the Taiwan Straits and in the Asia-\r\nPacific region. \r\n The Olympic Games, which represent humanity’s \r\naspiration for peace, development, cooperation and \r\nfriendship, will for the first time be held in China, a \r\ncountry both ancient and youthful, starting on 8 August \r\n2008. One World, One Dream — this is the theme of \r\nthe Beijing Olympic Games. The 1.3 billion people in \r\nChina, together with the rest of the world, are eagerly \r\nlooking forward to the opening of the Games. The \r\n2008 Olympic Games are a great event for both the \r\nChinese people and the other peoples of the world. We \r\nare confident that with the efforts made by the Chinese \r\npeople and with strong support from the international \r\ncommunity, the 2008 Olympic Games will stand out as \r\na highly successful event. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Arab Republic of Egypt. \r\n Mr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Six \r\nyears ago, in September 2001, we, the representatives \r\nof the international community, stood united and in \r\nsolidarity in the face of international terrorism. In all \r\nour languages, faiths and cultures, we expressed our \r\ncondemnation of any terrorist act that targets innocent \r\ncivilians. We denounced and deplored such acts, then \r\nresolved to work seriously to combat this grave and \r\nalarming phenomenon. We agreed to work earnestly, \r\nnot only to deal with terrorism from a security \r\nperspective, but also to achieve long-awaited \r\nbreakthroughs in the old crises and conflicts, which \r\nbecause of their complexity and longevity have \r\noverwhelmed the desperate and the hopeless in our \r\nparticular region. Those conflicts fuel people’s sense of \r\ninjustice and despair and push them into the ranks of \r\nthose who espouse dark extremist ideas that consider \r\nviolence as the only means of operation and even \r\nsometimes as an end in itself. \r\n We were all prepared for action. There was a \r\nwidespread belief in the Middle East region that major \r\nbreakthroughs were imminent, that the successful \r\ncontainment and eradication of international terrorism \r\nwould take place not only through security operations \r\nbut also through concurrent actions of equal \r\nimportance aimed at draining its intellectual resources \r\nand freezing its human and financial assets. \r\n However, we seem to have gone astray during \r\nthose six years. Our objectives were fragmented, and \r\nour energies were scattered. We failed as an \r\ninternational community to maintain the huge \r\nmomentum generated in this very Hall in September \r\n2001, that momentum which found expression in our \r\nresolve to work together to defuse tensions in our \r\nregion as a step towards the settlement of its chronic \r\npolitical conflicts. \r\n Regrettably, narrow-minded, domestic political \r\nagendas have been imposed by some, and unwise \r\nobjectives have replaced the lofty ones that we had \r\nplanned to achieve. Instead of focusing on the \r\neradication of the hotbeds of international terrorism — \r\nhotbeds which were not numerous six years ago — we \r\nlost sight of our main goal and vision. The eradication \r\nof international terrorism was no longer the goal but \r\ninstead became a loose phrase. There was oppression, \r\ntorture and humiliation, and, on the other side, more \r\nviolence, resistance and atrocities. \r\n This came as no surprise to us, since the objective \r\nwas regrettably lost. We all stood stunned and \r\nflabbergasted before the events that were unfolding in \r\nthis region and the world. How could we have been \r\ndiverted from our goal? How could it be that our world \r\nwas dragged down almost to the level of a clash \r\nbetween civilizations, cultures and religions? Why are \r\nsome attempting to thrust the holy religion of Islam \r\ninto the labyrinth of a limitless clash with the West, a \r\nclash that serves no one’s interests? To the contrary, it \r\ncauses everyone grievous harm. Here comes the \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 22 \r\n \r\nquestion: what can we, the national people of the \r\nworld, do to get back on course? \r\n In all honesty, I must tell you that this last \r\nquestion is our main concern in the Middle East. \r\nDespite the importance of the other questions, and even \r\nthough we are fully aware of the answers thereto, we \r\nprefer to leave aside these questions and to let the \r\nhistorians and scholars probe them, detect any errors \r\nand assign historical responsibility to each party. \r\n But in truth the more urgent task is to get back on \r\ncourse by finding a way out of the dark tunnel we have \r\nbeen forced into. In our opinion, the right way to \r\nproceed is to go back to where we should have started \r\nfrom in the first place and to address directly and \r\neffectively the chronic conflicts, foremost among them \r\nbeing the Arab-Israeli conflict and its core issue, the \r\nPalestinian question. \r\n Any attempt to achieve stability and disseminate \r\npeace and security in the world without a serious \r\nsettlement of the Palestinian question and the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict will not be successful. The opposite is \r\nalso true. Serious and sustained action to achieve a just \r\nand comprehensive settlement of that conflict and that \r\nquestion directly serves international peace and \r\nsecurity and contributes to the stabilization of the \r\nMiddle East region. All of us are aware of the \r\nimportance of Middle East stability for the stability of \r\nthe world at large. Furthermore, we are duty-bound to \r\ncontinue our work to defuse tensions in Iraq and \r\nLebanon and to stabilize and improve the situation in \r\nDarfur. \r\n It is hard to believe that sixteen years have \r\nalready passed since the convening of the historic \r\nMadrid Peace Conference between the Arabs and \r\nIsrael. Fourteen years have elapsed since the signing of \r\nthe first Palestinian-Israeli accord in Oslo. Eleven \r\nyears ago, Arab States adopted peace as their strategic \r\noption to end their conflict with Israel. Five full years \r\nhave passed since the declaration by the Arab States of \r\ntheir historic initiative regarding their readiness to \r\nestablish normal peace relations with Israel in return \r\nfor the latter’s withdrawal from the territories it \r\noccupied by force in 1967 and for the just settlement of \r\nthe Palestinian question. It has also been five years \r\nsince the Palestinians and the Israelis reached a number \r\nof agreed points and memorandums that come very \r\nclose to the final settlement of this question. \r\n Given all of the above, one would scarcely \r\nbelieve that peace today still seems farther away than it \r\nwas in the early 1990s. It is hard to believe that there is \r\nnow talk going around in vicious circles about the \r\nbases and principles of the settlement, which are \r\nalready known to all of us. It is also hard to believe \r\nthat strenuous efforts are made to resume negotiations \r\nto agree yet again on mechanisms and formulations. \r\nRehashing those old and worn-out subjects is an \r\nexercise in futility. \r\n We in Egypt realize that the persistence of this \r\nconflict inflames passions and minds in the region. The \r\nAssembly knows the efforts and sacrifices made by \r\nEgypt in order to put a just and comprehensive end to \r\nthis historic conflict in a manner that serves the \r\ninterests of all parties. \r\n But this issue requires leadership; it requires \r\ncourage from all parties. It also requires a clear and \r\ncorrect vision that the lack of a peaceful settlement of \r\nthis conflict not only denies the right of a whole people \r\nto freedom and dignity, but also feeds directly the calls \r\nfor violence, extremism and the relinquishing of \r\npeaceful and political negotiation as a means to \r\nachieve the objective. Thus the conflict will continue to \r\nrage for years to come; peoples will continue to suffer; \r\nthe world will continue to face the current state of \r\nsharp instability and polarization, as we are currently \r\nwitnessing. \r\n Egypt has displayed and continues to display its \r\nconstant readiness to work with all parties: \r\nPalestinians, Israelis, Americans, Europeans and all \r\nthose who take to heart the interests of the Palestinian \r\npeople, the interests of the peoples of the region and \r\nthe interest of world peace and stability. Our purpose is \r\nto achieve the resumption of serious political dialogue, \r\nwhich would lead to a settlement within a strict, \r\nspecified time frame.  \r\n We will spare no effort to achieve that objective. \r\nWe will not despair in the face of problems and \r\ndifficulties. We will work in all sincerity because we \r\nare committed to the cause of our Palestinian brothers \r\nand to the establishment of an independent, sovereign \r\nPalestinian State on the Palestinian territories occupied \r\nin 1967, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. We will \r\ncontinue to work because we are committed to the \r\nliberation of the rest of the occupied Arab territories in \r\nSyria and Lebanon and because we are committed to \r\nthe objective of achieving just and comprehensive \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n23 07-52121 \r\n \r\npeace in the Middle East. In this respect, the meeting \r\ncalled for by President Bush this fall may, if well \r\nprepared, provide an important opportunity to achieve \r\nlong-awaited progress. \r\n Brotherly Iraq continues to bleed; thousands of \r\nits citizens continue to be killed; thousands more \r\ncontinue to flee as a result of difficult living \r\nconditions. The state of today’s Iraq breaks the heart of \r\none and all. In spite of the political process in Iraq, \r\nwhich we understood and encouraged, events on the \r\nground, with their extremely negative repercussions, \r\nare what shapes today’s Iraq and its image before the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n Iraq today sorely needs leaders and leaderships \r\nthat are keen on preserving the unity of this major Arab \r\ncountry. It needs leaders who seek consensus and steer \r\naway from sectarianism and confessionalism. It needs \r\nleaders who extend the hand of dialogue to each other, \r\nwho do not point guns at one another: it needs leaders \r\nwho close ranks to combat the illegal armed factions \r\nand militias that take the lives of dozens of Iraqis \r\neveryday. It needs leaders who would sit together to \r\nagree on the shape and future of the State of Iraq in the \r\nIraqi Constitution, which we believe should express the \r\nhopes and dreams of all Iraqis without exclusion or \r\nmarginalization. It should build a modern developed \r\nState that is enriched by its diversity and that does not \r\nallocate its posts on the basis of sect or ethnic \r\nbackground in a manner that causes tension and \r\nincreases discord. \r\n Egypt reiterates the importance of the unity, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq in a manner \r\nthat enjoys the consensus of all Iraqis. We also reiterate \r\nthe need for foreign interventions to cease influencing \r\ndevelopments in that sisterly country. Egypt reaffirms \r\nits full support for any regional or international effort \r\nthat assists Iraqis to overcome this difficult situation. \r\nBy the same token, Egypt will continue to consistently \r\ncall upon Iraqis to show unity and engage in dialogue \r\nin order to restore and strengthen trust among them. \r\n Brotherly Lebanon is also going through a \r\nsensitive crisis. The prospects for settling that crisis \r\nseem remote and difficult in view of internal \r\ndifferences and the regional tug-of-war. The situation \r\nin Lebanon is delicate and must not be burdened by the \r\nweight of the conflicts raging in the region. Therefore, \r\nEgypt has consistently called for Lebanon to be left to \r\nits people to determine what they wish for themselves. \r\nWe continue to encourage Lebanon’s politicians to \r\nengage in dialogue among themselves. It is our hope \r\nthat they will be able to deal with the upcoming \r\nentitlements, foremost and most important among \r\nwhich are the presidential elections, in a manner \r\nconsistent with the Lebanese Constitution and that \r\nwould enable them to preserve Lebanon’s \r\nconstitutional institutions and the proud achievements \r\nof its democracy. The Lebanese model of coexistence \r\nis significant and should not be allowed to suffer a \r\nsetback similar to that suffered in the past. Egypt will \r\nwork with all parties to achieve that objective. \r\n Since the onset of its crisis, the Darfur region of \r\nSudan has witnessed difficult conditions. This has \r\nrequired time, effort and hard work from all of us to \r\ndefuse that crisis and to reach a settlement that would \r\nensure for the whole population of the region the right \r\nto a decent life. Egypt welcomed the broad concern of \r\nthe international community over those difficult \r\nconditions and sought, in cooperation with concerned \r\ninternational and regional parties, to bring the parties \r\nin the crisis close to each other.  \r\n As concrete proof of its concern for the \r\nstabilization of the situation in Darfur, Egypt has \r\noffered a generous contribution of nearly 3,500 troops \r\nto the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation \r\nin the region. That offer still stands. In addition, Egypt \r\nhas contributed to the development of the region by \r\ndrilling 40 boreholes that would make water resources \r\navailable to larger numbers of people in Darfur. \r\n Egypt profoundly believes in the three main \r\npillars of international disarmament treaties:  \r\nnon-proliferation, disarmament and the inherent right \r\nof every State to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In \r\n1995, Egypt accepted the indefinite extension of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nwithin an integrated package that included a resolution \r\ncalling upon all States of the region without exception, \r\nto accede to the Treaty and compelling those States \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international \r\nsecurity to discharge their responsibilities. However, \r\nthis objective is still to be achieved because Israel has \r\nnot yet acceded to the Treaty despite all the \r\ninternational and regional calls on it to do so. \r\n Today’s world is regrettably witnessing an \r\nimbalance and double standards in dealings with the \r\nvarious parties that have nuclear ambitions, potential or \r\nexpertise. Egypt believes that the international \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 24 \r\n \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation system will be \r\nstrengthened and that regional security in the Middle \r\nEast will be reinforced only when a single standard is \r\napplied equally to all the States of the region without \r\nexception. \r\n The previous session witnessed many serious \r\nefforts and consultations concerning the question of the \r\nreform and expansion of the Security Council. Despite \r\nthe plethora of consultations, meetings and endeavours, \r\nthis objective remains elusive. As a member of the \r\nAfrican Group, Egypt once again states its full \r\ncommitment to the specifics of the unified African \r\nposition. It remains a fair and balanced position that \r\nwould, if implemented, achieve legitimate African \r\naspirations. I cannot fail to refer here to the fact that \r\nthe reform of the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil is a genuine objective in itself that must not \r\nfade or be obscured by the attempts of some to expand \r\nthe Council. \r\n We have plenty of work to do, but since time is \r\nshort I would like to say that the state of our world is \r\nno cause for rejoicing. Rather it is a cause for concern. \r\nThis requires us to work together with open minds in \r\norder to change it for the better, and in order to meet \r\nthe aspirations of our peoples to freedom, justice, a \r\ndignified life, security and peace. \r\n During this session, Egypt will raise and defend \r\nthe priorities and visions I have put forward in this \r\nstatement along with a host of other subjects that time \r\ndid not allow me to address. It is our hope that we will \r\nall write in responding to the challenges facing us. We \r\nall bear responsibility and will all suffer the \r\nconsequences of failure. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nHighness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab \r\nEmirates. \r\n Sheikh Al Nahyan (United Arab Emirates) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): It gives me great pleasure to \r\nexpress, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, our sincere congratulations to you, Sir, and \r\nto your friendly country on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \r\nWe look forward to working closely with you as you \r\nseek to successfully discharge your mission. \r\n I would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nyour predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for \r\nher remarkable achievements during her presidency at \r\nthe sixty-first session of the General Assembly, in \r\nparticular her efforts to stimulate more active debate \r\namong cultures. \r\n I also take this opportunity to express our \r\nwarmest greetings to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nthe Secretary-General, and to note our appreciation of \r\nthe initiatives he has taken to promote the role of the \r\nUnited Nations since assuming his post. \r\n Our world still suffers from a wide range of \r\nregional and international issues, conflicts and threats, \r\nmost visible among which are the worldwide spread of \r\npoverty and epidemics, the degradation of the \r\nenvironment, terrorism, organized crime, the spread of \r\nextremism and violations of human rights, and attempts \r\nto obtain nuclear weapons. This should prompt us to \r\nmake sincere and determined efforts to implement the \r\nrecommendations, decisions and plans of action \r\napproved by the world’s leaders and by the United \r\nNations. \r\n Given its interest in and commitment to the \r\nprinciple of good-neighbourly relations, as well as its \r\nrespect for the national sovereignty of other States, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates would like to draw attention to \r\nthe fact that, thus far, no progress whatsoever has been \r\nmade on the issue of the Iranian occupation since 1971 \r\nof three islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates: \r\nthe Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. This \r\nis despite the consistent efforts expended and the \r\npositive peaceful initiatives taken by my country, \r\nwhich wants this issue settled by peaceful means, \r\neither through bilateral and unconditioned negotiations \r\nor by referral of the issue to the International Court of \r\nJustice for legal arbitration. \r\n Severe conflict has sorely wounded our region, \r\nand quick and effective treatment is required. As for \r\nIraq, we express our firm belief that all should abstain \r\nfrom interference in Iraq’s internal affairs and should \r\nshow respect for the national sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Iraq. This requires that all parties should \r\ncooperate to bring to an end the cycle of violence and \r\nthe inflaming of passions, and it calls for partition and \r\ndivision. Let us give our support to an Iraqi \r\nGovernment that truly works to achieve national \r\nreconciliation. The United Arab Emirates renews its \r\nencouragement for the efforts made to promote \r\nreconstruction in Iraq. \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n25 07-52121 \r\n \r\n Regarding the Middle East crisis, we call on the \r\nUnited Nations, and the Security Council in particular, \r\nto play a more active role, together with the Middle \r\nEast Quartet, to give new momentum to the Middle \r\nEast peace process. We stress that no solution to the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict is possible without Israel’s \r\nacceptance of the Arab Peace Initiative, which is based \r\non the relevant United Nations resolutions and offers a \r\nbalanced and comprehensive solution to this long-\r\nstanding conflict. \r\n In this context, we are following with interest the \r\nefforts to convene the international peace conference \r\nfor the Middle East later this year with the \r\nparticipation of all concerned parties. We look forward \r\nto a balanced and fair settlement of the issue on the \r\nbasis of the Arab Peace Initiative, the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, and the rules of \r\ninternational legitimacy. We also renew our support for \r\nSyria’s right to regain its full sovereignty over the \r\noccupied Golan Heights. \r\n We note with satisfaction the United Nations role \r\nin restoring security and stability in Lebanon, thanks to \r\nthe pressure put on Israel to fulfil its legal obligations \r\nunder Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), \r\nincluding respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty, \r\nwithdrawal from the Shaba’a farmlands and the village \r\nof al-Ghajar and the handing over of detailed maps and \r\ncoordinates of the landmines that Israel planted in \r\nsouthern Lebanon. \r\n We reaffirm our support for the reconstruction \r\nefforts and for the stability and territorial integrity of \r\nLebanon as well as for the maintenance of its \r\nconstitutional institutions. In this respect, the United \r\nArab Emirates has undertaken a number of \r\nreconstruction projects in Lebanon and has provided \r\nhumanitarian assistance. The United Arab Emirates \r\ncollaborates closely with the Lebanese Government \r\nand the United Nations to remove mines and \r\nunexploded ordnance, this work having originally \r\ncommenced as part of an initiative taken by the United \r\nArab Emirates in 2001, when my Government provided \r\ninitial funding of $50 million. \r\n We hope that talks between Iran and the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency will eventually \r\nlead to a permanent, peaceful solution that will spare \r\nthe region further tensions and conflicts and will help \r\nto reassure countries in the region that they will not be \r\nfaced with any threats to their security. We stress again \r\nthat Israel should not be excluded from the terms of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n The United Arab Emirates continues to cooperate \r\nfully with all efforts to combat all forms of terrorism, \r\nincluding associated money-laundering. We also \r\nemphasize the importance of promoting dialogue \r\namong cultures and civilizations and of enhancing \r\ntolerance among religions. \r\n The United Arab Emirates contributes generously \r\nto the financing of development projects in some \r\n95 States. Such assistance has exceeded $70 billion and \r\nis intended to promote a culture of peace and stability \r\nin those countries and throughout the world. Consistent \r\nwith that approach, the United Arab Emirates has \r\ncreated a number of institutions, including the Abu \r\nDhabi Fund for Development, the Zayed Charitable \r\nand Humanitarian Foundation, the Khalifa bin Zayed \r\nFoundation for Charitable Work and the Mohammed \r\nbin Rashid Al Maktoum Charity, which recently \r\nlaunched the “Dubai Cares” charity campaign, which \r\nseeks to guarantee education for 1 million children \r\naround the world, especially in Asia and Africa. \r\n Since its creation in 1971, the United Arab \r\nEmirates has achieved economic, social and cultural \r\nprogress that has helped to establish stability and well-\r\nbeing for citizens of the Emirates and job opportunities \r\nfor the millions who work in our country. \r\n We have also launched an interim political reform \r\nplan, in whose first phase half of the members of the \r\nFederal National Council were elected as an important \r\nstep towards political participation. In this context, I \r\nshould also like to make reference to the significant \r\nnational gains that have been made by women in the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates. Two women sit in the Council \r\nof Ministers, and women hold approximately a quarter \r\nof the seats in the Federal National Council. They are \r\nalso represented in the judiciary and in other senior \r\nleadership and decision-making positions. \r\n In the context of its national, regional and \r\ninternational efforts and cooperation, the United Arab \r\nEmirates has enacted laws to counter terrorist crimes \r\nand money-laundering and has frozen many suspect \r\nbank and corporate accounts. It has also enacted laws \r\non issues such as human trafficking and international \r\njudicial cooperation on criminal matters, and has \r\nadopted import and export control procedures for a \r\nrange of commodities. \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 26 \r\n \r\n In its desire for educational and cultural contact \r\nwith the rest of the world, the United Arab Emirates \r\nhas launched a number of initiatives, including the \r\n$2-million Sheikh Zayed Book Award, designed to \r\nmotivate creative writers and intellectuals to make \r\ncontributions in all spheres of the humanities. \r\n As part of our efforts to bring the experience of \r\nthe world’s most prestigious universities to the United \r\nArab Emirates, we have recently launched the Paris-\r\nSorbonne University Abu Dhabi and have inaugurated \r\nthe Emirates Foundation to raise our educational, \r\ntechnological, intellectual and research resources to the \r\nhighest global levels. Further underlining our belief in \r\nthe importance of cultural communication among the \r\nworld’s peoples for the preservation of the historical \r\nheritage of human civilization, we have agreed to build \r\ntwo world-class satellite museums in the United Arab \r\nEmirates: the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the Guggenheim \r\nAbu Dhabi. \r\n The United Arab Emirates prides itself on being \r\nhome for people of all religions, ethnicities, cultures \r\nand countries from all continents. Indeed, the number \r\nof countries represented in the Emirates exceeds the \r\ntotal membership of the United Nations. All these \r\npeople live in the Emirates in harmony, forming a \r\nmodel for what the modern world should be like. \r\n In compliance with its obligations under \r\ninternational human rights and labour treaties, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates has enacted legislation to \r\nguarantee the full rights of its expatriate workforce in \r\naccordance with relevant national and international \r\nlaws and treaties. I affirm here that the relevant \r\nauthorities in the United Arab Emirates are determined \r\nthat these laws and treaties should be fully \r\nimplemented so as to protect workers and provide them \r\nwith the best working and living conditions. \r\n Finally, we hope that our deliberations on the \r\nurgent international issues on the agenda of the current \r\nsixty-second session of the General Assembly will \r\ncontinue in a spirit of solidarity and will lead to \r\npositive steps towards the eventual fulfilment of our \r\naspiration to peace, development and prosperity for our \r\nworld and its peoples. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Ursula Plassnik, Federal Minister for \r\nEuropean and International Affairs of the Republic of \r\nAustria. \r\n Ms. Plassnik (Austria): Let me address at the \r\noutset a burning issue: the situation in \r\nMyanmar/Burma. We join the call of many, including \r\nour partners in the European Union and in the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, for an \r\nimmediate cessation of violence. The bloodshed has to \r\nstop. Democratic rights and the freedom of assembly \r\nand expression have to be respected. We reiterate the \r\ncall for the release from detention of Nobel Peace Prize \r\nlaureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burmese \r\ndemocratic opposition. That appeal was also made at \r\nthis morning’s meeting of the Women’s Empowerment \r\nNetwork, which unites women leaders from around the \r\nglobe. \r\n We can all feel a sense of urgency at this sixty-\r\nsecond General Assembly session about the need to \r\ncounter contemporary challenges with decisive joint \r\naction. Climate change, disarmament and dangerous \r\ntechnologies are just three examples requiring such \r\njoint action, now. \r\n Let me thus call for relaunching effective \r\nmultilateralism. And let me make the case for a new \r\nglobal partnership — the joint search for sustainable \r\njoint solutions, united by a shared sense of \r\nresponsibility and purpose. The very concept of \r\npartnership is key in addressing the new challenges, \r\nboth inside our societies and in the global village. \r\nPartnership is an eye-to-eye approach, based on \r\nrecognizing and respecting each other as equals. \r\nPartnership is also a demanding option: anyone who \r\nwants to be treated as a partner has to behave as a \r\npartner. \r\n We all know that none of us, not even the \r\nstrongest, can master the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury on his or her own. In the age of globalization, \r\nunilateralism and nationalism are dead-end streets. \r\nThey simply do not achieve effective and durable \r\nresults. We thus need both global processes and global \r\nobjectives. We need to actively engage to build \r\nconfidence and to counter the erosion of trust that so \r\noften breeds unilateral action. \r\n Climate change is the obvious challenge to be \r\naddressed in such a new global partnership. The United \r\nNations is the only framework in which a fair and truly \r\nglobal agreement can be designed. Regional and \r\nsectoral efforts need to be linked, feeding into this \r\nglobal process. Furthermore, it is here only that those \r\nwho contribute least to climate change but are most \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n27 07-52121 \r\n \r\naffected by it — such as the small island developing \r\nStates — can make their voices heard. \r\n Disarmament, arms control and conflict \r\nprevention are next in need of a credible relaunch of \r\nmultilateralism and a new partnership. In the nuclear \r\nage, we simply cannot afford to acquiesce to the \r\npresent level of armament and to signs of a new arms \r\nrace. Non-proliferation and an actual reduction of \r\nweapons stockpiles thus have to make an immediate \r\ncomeback to the top of the global agenda. \r\n On certain limited issues, multilateral progress is \r\nwithin reach. A consistently growing number of States \r\nis rallying behind our call for the adoption by 2008 of a \r\nlegally binding instrument to prohibit cluster \r\nmunitions, which cause unacceptable harm to civilians. \r\nAustria is determined to continue leading this process \r\nby example, with a total national ban of this atrocious \r\nweapon. \r\n Nuclear technology is a third field for a new \r\nglobal partnership. The world is turning nuclear, \r\nwhether we like it or not. This in itself is regrettable \r\nfor countries like Austria which have renounced \r\nnuclear energy altogether because we believe it is a \r\ndangerous and non-sustainable source of energy. \r\nInevitably, the rise of nuclear power across the globe \r\nwill lead to more and more tensions with regard to the \r\nnature — whether for energy purposes or for weapons \r\ndevelopment — of national nuclear programmes. There \r\nis a highly dangerous grey zone between what is \r\npermitted and what is possible. \r\n A new global partnership where sensitive parts of \r\nthe nuclear fuel cycle are multilateralized could offer a \r\nway out. We should create a regime in which \r\nenrichment facilities would be placed under the control \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nThe Agency would guarantee adequate fuel supply to \r\nthose who fulfil strict non-proliferation criteria through \r\nan international nuclear fuel bank. This would help to \r\ndissuade tensions and make new national enrichment \r\nfacilities superfluous. \r\n At present, the Iranian nuclear programme — for \r\nmany reasons — is deeply upsetting for the entire \r\ninternational community, not just for some of us. Iran \r\nshould take these concerns very seriously. It is clearly \r\nup to Iran to dispel any shadow of doubt over the \r\nnature of its programme by providing undisputable \r\nproof to the world’s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, now. \r\nLike many others, we strongly support Director \r\nGeneral ElBaradei’s appeal for a double time-out and \r\nurge Iran to heed this call. \r\n Our engagement for peace and security is rooted \r\nin the firm belief that right must prevail over might. \r\nSmaller and medium-sized Member States like Austria \r\nunderstandably have a profound attachment to the rule \r\nof law. For us, respect for the rule of law is a matter \r\nnot of choice but of necessity. Together with many \r\nother like-minded countries, we will continue \r\npromoting the rule of law and will give strong support \r\nto the newly established Rule of Law Assistance Unit. \r\n Austria believes in the power of partnership, \r\nwhere equality, mutual trust and respect for diversity \r\novercome the crude logic of power. From our \r\nexperience, effective global partnership best builds on \r\nboth regional partnerships and regional ownership. \r\nAustria is thus committed to developing a new \r\nrelationship among equals between the European \r\nUnion and the African Union, at the forthcoming \r\nEuropean Union-Africa summit in Lisbon. \r\n To this end, Burkina Faso and Austria will \r\nco-host a conference in Ouagadougou in November on \r\nhow to create sustainable peace. The meeting will unite \r\nparticipants from countries of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States and Europe in an \r\nendeavour to provide a common input to the Lisbon \r\nsummit — by furthering policies of good-\r\nneighbourliness, the rule of law and good governance; \r\nby fighting the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons; by creating employment for young people; \r\nand by actively promoting the education of girls. \r\n Together with the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion is currently breaking new ground with the \r\npreparations for the African Union-United Nations \r\nHybrid Operation in Darfur. The human suffering we \r\nwitness in the region sometimes goes beyond \r\nimagination. We therefore welcome the ongoing efforts \r\nto alleviate this plight, including in neighbouring \r\nStates. \r\n We Europeans cannot credibly call upon other \r\nregions of the world to assume their regional \r\nresponsibilities if we remain unable to cope with the \r\nchallenges on our own continent, and in particular the \r\nKosovo issue. We need to resolve the last open status \r\nissue in the Western Balkans now. We therefore fully \r\nsupport the ongoing efforts of the Kosovo Troika and \r\nencourage Belgrade and Pristina to energetically make \r\nuse of that negotiating space. The Special Envoy of the \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 28 \r\n \r\nSecretary-General, President Ahtisaari, has provided us \r\nwith a clear sense of direction. We Europeans want \r\neach and every person in Kosovo to live in dignity, \r\nfreedom and security. The international organizations \r\nconcerned, including the European Union, must spare \r\nno effort towards that end. It is also our continued \r\nobligation under Security Council resolution 1244 \r\n(1999), which referred to the specific contribution the \r\nEuropean Union can make to the stability of Kosovo as \r\nwell as the entire Balkan region. \r\n Women around the world are ready to bear a key \r\nresponsibility in conflict prevention, conflict resolution \r\nand peacebuilding. But women also need to be given a \r\nfair share of positions in international mediation and \r\npeacebuilding efforts. Not so long ago, there was not a \r\nsingle woman among the 54 United Nations Special \r\nRepresentatives and Envoys to conflict and post-\r\nconflict regions. I am encouraged by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s support on this matter and the recent \r\nnomination of three women Deputy Special \r\nRepresentatives: for Liberia, the Sudan and Lebanon. It \r\nis also up to us, the Member States, to nominate more \r\nwomen for such positions. \r\n No conflict is too complex or too deep to durably \r\nresist dialogue. The absence of dialogue breeds \r\nmisperceptions and sometimes even opens space for \r\nviolence. Austria has long-standing experience in \r\npromoting dialogue among civilizations, religions and \r\ncultures, and we will continue our activities in that \r\nfield with vigour. We must actively combat attempts to \r\nhijack religion for other purposes anywhere in our \r\nglobal village. Religious leaders must also take a clear \r\nstance in condemning and fighting practices not related \r\nto religion, such as so-called honour killings or female \r\ngenital mutilation. \r\n Austria firmly supports the current bilateral and \r\ninternational efforts that are taking place to renew the \r\ndialogue between Israel and its Arab neighbours. We \r\nhope that the meetings between Prime Minister Olmert \r\nand President Abbas will create the basis for \r\nimplementing the two-State solution: Israel and a \r\nPalestinian State living as neighbours in peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n We appreciate the efforts by the United States for \r\nan international meeting later this year to assist the \r\nparties in their quest for a just solution. We expect that \r\nmeeting to advance the peace process substantially and \r\nsustainably by addressing the core issues, and we stand \r\nready to assist in preparatory and follow-up activities. \r\nThe people of the entire Middle East region are thirsty \r\nfor a new perspective of hope. \r\n In 2008 we will celebrate a landmark in the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights: the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights and its immutable foundation, the universality \r\nof fundamental rights. All human beings are born free \r\nand equal in dignity and rights. It is therefore not \r\nacceptable that human rights be revitalized or \r\ndiminished in relation to geography or other factors. \r\nThere is no doubt that women must enjoy the same \r\nuniversal rights, wherever they live and whatever their \r\nculture, creed or religion. \r\n Our peoples expect from their leadership nothing \r\nless than a life in dignity, but above all a life in \r\nfreedom from fear and in freedom from want. If we are \r\ntruly committed to human security, it is essential that \r\nwe make every effort to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by determined, concerted action to \r\neradicate poverty and hunger, to promote equality \r\nbetween men and women and to protect our planet’s \r\nresources. The Austrian Government has made it an \r\nexplicit priority to actively live up to the rising \r\nchallenges. \r\n Based on our long-standing engagement for the \r\nprinciples and values of the United Nations, I pledge \r\nthat Austria will be a responsible and reliable partner \r\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council \r\nfor the term 2009-2010. We hope that the Members of \r\nthe United Nations will entrust Austria with that \r\nresponsibility, which we stand ready to shoulder in a \r\nspirit of true partnership. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ivailo Kalfin, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria. \r\n Mr. Kalfin (Bulgaria): It is a privilege and an \r\nhonour for me to address this audience and to represent \r\nBulgaria in its new status as a State member of the \r\nEuropean Union. Having subscribed to the statement \r\nmade by the Prime Minister of Portugal (see \r\nA/62/PV.4), I would like to assure the Assembly that, \r\nas part of the European family, my country is now even \r\nmore committed to the universal and normative role of \r\nthe United Nations in today’s globalized world. \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n29 07-52121 \r\n \r\n I warmly congratulate you, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, on \r\nyour assumption of the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session. We are delighted \r\nto see in the leadership of this body an outstanding \r\nrepresentative of a neighbouring State and of our \r\nregion, South-Eastern Europe. I reiterate that my \r\ncountry fully supports the priorities you have outlined \r\nfor the work of this session. We wish you every success \r\nin the months ahead. \r\n Our gratitude goes to Her Excellency Sheikha \r\nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her leadership as \r\nPresident of the sixty-first session. I also take this \r\nopportunity to commend the dedicated and energetic \r\nperformance of the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, \r\nduring his first nine months in office. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n I would like to thank the President for having \r\nchosen climate change as a central theme for our \r\ndebate. That world challenge calls upon all of us to \r\nprovide an immediate response based on shared but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities of Member countries. We \r\nwelcome the fact that the high-level event on climate \r\nchange held on 24 September has given considerable \r\nimpetus to future negotiations on a new international \r\nagreement, which will benefit broadly from the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the Kyoto Protocol. \r\n Global warming is exacerbating the serious \r\neconomic and social problems that developing \r\ncountries are facing. It also threatens the \r\nimplementation of development goals set by the \r\ninternational community, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. In that regard, we join other \r\ncountries in supporting the recent United Kingdom \r\ninitiative calling for urgent action to meet those goals. \r\nBulgaria is prepared to play its part in solidarity with \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Unfortunately, the list of serious threats to our \r\ncommon security is not short. Non-proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction, arms control and \r\ndisarmament continue to be at the forefront of the \r\ninternational scene. Strengthening the regime of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to \r\nmake it truly universal remains one of the major \r\npriorities of our time. It is regrettable that no progress \r\nhas been achieved on the pending question regarding \r\nIran’s nuclear programme. \r\n Bulgaria reaffirms its support for the United \r\nNations Programme of Action on Small Arms. We are \r\nfirmly committed to the process towards adoption of an \r\ninternational treaty on the arms trade in the near future. \r\n My country unambiguously condemns terrorism \r\nand rejects terrorist ideology in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. Terrorism cannot be linked to any \r\nspecific culture or religion. The United Nations must \r\ncontinue to play a central role in mobilizing the \r\ninternational community to meet this challenge and to \r\nmeet the related challenge of radicalism and political \r\nextremism. \r\n In order to combat terrorism, we must first \r\naddress the fundamental problems of poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment, overcome prejudices and \r\nstereotypes and promote tolerance in a world of great \r\ndiversity. That is why Bulgaria has joined the Group of \r\nFriends of the Alliance of Civilizations, fully \r\nsupporting other complementary initiatives as well. \r\n The situation in Iraq continues to be a source of \r\nconcern for the international community. This calls for \r\nthe commitment of the United Nations. Bulgaria is \r\nparticipating in joint efforts to ensure that Iraq will be \r\nable to achieve its vision of a safe, unified and \r\ndemocratic State. \r\n Afghanistan is another example where a powerful \r\nneed has been felt to see increased involvement of the \r\nUnited Nations, along with NATO and the European \r\nUnion, to support the difficult national reconstruction \r\nprocess. \r\n Progress towards peace in the Middle East is of \r\nprimary importance for the international community. \r\nBulgaria welcomes the resumption of bilateral talks \r\nbetween President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert \r\nand hopes that they will lead to a just and lasting \r\nsolution in accordance with the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe Security Council and the Quartet principles. \r\nLebanon too continues to require a strong commitment \r\non our part to secure its national unity, territorial \r\nintegrity, recovery and reconstruction. \r\n Today, the role of the United Nations is no longer \r\nsolely to maintain peace, but to ensure that peace is \r\nfirmly rooted and sustainable. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is now up and running. We believe that it \r\nhas great potential, and its position vis-à-vis the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations must be \r\nstrengthened and better defined. We see the future of \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 30 \r\n \r\nthe Commission as a modern multilateral instrument \r\nfor the long-term resolution of conflicts. \r\n The institution-building process in the Human \r\nRights Council has led to a compromise. We believe \r\nthat this has led to opportunities for us to make the \r\nCouncil an effective international tool to promote \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. \r\n Bulgaria fully shares the view that human life has \r\nsupreme value and invites Member States to support a \r\ndraft resolution on a moratorium on and abolition of \r\nthe death penalty. \r\n For multilateralism to be effective, it must \r\ninvolve strong partnership between the United Nations \r\nand regional organizations. We heartily endorse the \r\ngrowing interaction between the United Nations and \r\nthe European Union. The recently updated Joint \r\nDeclaration on United Nations-European Union \r\nCooperation in Crisis Management has provided a new \r\navenue for joint action. In addition, the United Nations \r\nand the African Union are involved in an \r\nunprecedented peace operation, the African Union-\r\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, for \r\nremedying the critical situation in Darfur. We also \r\nwelcome the pragmatic cooperation established \r\nbetween the United Nations and NATO. \r\n Various forms of regional and subregional \r\ncooperation have always been the cornerstone of a \r\nglobal system of collective security. Bulgaria is now \r\nchairing two regional organizations: the Central \r\nEuropean Initiative and the South-East European \r\nCooperation Process. Regional cooperation in South-\r\nEast Europe has grown stronger and is gaining \r\nmomentum. The Stability Pact, which was launched at \r\nthe initiative of the European Union in 1999, has \r\nprovided important impetus. In accordance with the \r\nconcept of regional ownership, the key role today has \r\nbeen assumed by the South-East European Cooperation \r\nProcess. Agreement on the creation of a regional \r\ncooperation council secretariat has just been signed by \r\nthe Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the member \r\ncountries in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv. \r\n Bulgaria is now leading this process and will \r\nspare no effort to strengthen the prospects for \r\nEuropean integration for the entire South-East \r\nEuropean region. Our priorities focus on cooperation in \r\nsectors such as infrastructure, security, energy, the \r\nenvironment, tourism, justice and domestic affairs. \r\n The unresolved status of Kosovo has a negative \r\neffect on security in the entire region. We regret that \r\nthe Security Council has not been able to adopt a new \r\nresolution to replace resolution 1244 (1999) and thus to \r\nconfirm its backing for a negotiated solution on the \r\nbasis of the proposal of Special Envoy Ahtisaari. \r\nBulgaria steadily supports all efforts aimed at reaching, \r\nas quickly as possible, a viable and legitimate solution \r\nwith respect to the status of Kosovo. Such a settlement \r\nwould guarantee regional peace and stability; it should \r\ntake into account the interests and the concerns of \r\nneighbouring countries. \r\n Thanks to the efforts deployed by the Contact \r\nGroup Troika, we now have perhaps the final chance to \r\nfind a negotiated solution. We hope that Belgrade and \r\nPristina will be able to take this opportunity to find a \r\ncompromise that can open the path to a new European \r\nfuture. While these talks are under way, it is essential \r\nto prevent any worsening of the situation. The \r\ninternational community — first and foremost the \r\nUnited Nations, NATO, the European Union and the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope — are working together with local institutions, \r\nand they must continue to provide the necessary \r\ninstruments and the guarantees to preserve regional \r\nstability. \r\n Promoting democratization, stability, security and \r\ncooperation is a major challenge in the Black Sea \r\nregion. Consistent efforts are required so that we can \r\narrive at a settlement of the of the frozen conflicts in \r\nTransdniestria and in the southern Caucasus, which \r\ncontinue to undermine stability and hamper regional \r\ncooperation. \r\n Bulgaria actively supports the formulation and \r\nimplementation of the Black Sea dimension in the \r\npolicy of good-neighbourliness with the European \r\nUnion. Major projects have been started in important \r\nsectors such as transportation, energy, trade, \r\nenvironment and border security. Stability and \r\npredictability in this region are more important than \r\never to ensure energy security in Europe and to ensure \r\nthe diversification and reliability of energy supplies to \r\nthe continent. \r\n Bulgaria is firmly convinced that in order for the \r\nUnited Nations to play its role effectively worldwide, it \r\nmust steadfastly pursue the radical reforms identified \r\nat the 2005 World Summit. Progress was achieved at \r\nthe sixty-first session, but much remains to be done so \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n31 07-52121 \r\n \r\nthat the reforms meet the international community’s \r\nhopes. \r\n Despite the good-faith efforts of the mediators, \r\nno tangible progress has been seen on a question that \r\nhas been discussed at length: reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. My delegation supports the recommendation \r\nto move this process forward to the negotiation phase, \r\nwith a view to reaching a broadly acceptable \r\ncompromise that would take account of equitable \r\ngeographic representation. It is obvious that reform of \r\nthe Council will not be an easy task. We will require \r\ninterim solutions at various stages over a certain period \r\nof time. The first step, however, cannot be put off \r\nindefinitely, because if we are unable to reform the \r\nSecurity Council, then broad reform of the United \r\nNations will be incomplete. \r\n A critical consideration of the implementation of \r\na number of pilot countries in the One United Nations \r\nInitiative has revealed positive results. But consensus \r\nhas yet to emerge on how to further the process of \r\nattaining system-wide coherence in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations. We hope that the final outcome will \r\ntake the form of improved and increased development \r\nassistance, which would go together with a United \r\nNations synergy in the concerned countries and the \r\ncompetent structures. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n In conclusion, we should recognize that progress \r\nhas been made in a number of reform areas. But we \r\nhave not yet achieved enough. Bulgaria expects that \r\nthe remaining tasks on the United Nations reform \r\nagenda will be pursued energetically and without delay. \r\nTo that end we appeal to Member States to show more \r\nflexibility on the decisions needed to ensure the \r\nconsistency of the reform process. It is in our common \r\ninterest to ensure that the sixty-second session is a \r\nsuccess. So let us work together and with goodwill to \r\nmake it happen. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nBahrain. \r\n Shaikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nIt is my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, upon your \r\nelection as President of the Assembly at this session. \r\nThere is no doubt that your expertise and your \r\nknowledge of international affairs will ensure anther \r\nsuccessful session this year and will contribute to \r\nfulfilling the aspirations of our peoples for the United \r\nNations. \r\n I take this opportunity to express my deepest \r\nthanks and appreciation to our dear sister, Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, and \r\nto commend her for the way in which she so ably and \r\nwisely guided the work of the Assembly. As a result, \r\nserious ideas were put forward that yielded tangible \r\nresults for the development of the Organization and the \r\nrevitalization of its role. In that respect, we want to \r\nexpress our appreciation to all delegations that \r\ndisplayed a spirit of cooperation with her during her \r\npresidency. \r\n I have the pleasure also to thank His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his ongoing efforts \r\nto strengthen and develop the role of the United \r\nNations. We are confident that the Secretary-General’s \r\nlong experience as an able diplomat will enable him to \r\nundertake further efforts to strengthen the effectiveness \r\nof our international Organization. \r\n In our joint endeavours to achieve world peace, \r\nprosperity and justice, we must address the challenges \r\nand dangers confronting our world today from a \r\nstandpoint of faith in our one human destiny. We \r\nshould realize that international security is based on \r\njoint efforts to guarantee regional security and the \r\nstability of States. At the same time, international \r\npeace requires respect for international legitimacy, the \r\nrule of law and justice. Since comprehensive \r\ndevelopment is a national and international \r\nrequirement, it is important that we collectively and \r\nseriously face threats regardless of their forms or \r\nmanifestations, such as conflict, war, nuclear \r\nproliferation, terrorism, environment disaster, poverty, \r\nbackwardness and extremism, in accordance with the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the resolutions and decisions adopted by \r\nthe General Assembly, including the United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). \r\n The resolution containing the Millennium \r\nDeclaration was a unique and pioneering endeavour \r\nwhich embodied a consensus among the world leaders \r\nwho set out the goals we must reach in this new \r\nmillennium. In this respect, the Kingdom of Bahrain is \r\nproud, by the grace of God, to have witnessed \r\ncomprehensive political developments in its \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 32 \r\n \r\ndemocratic march forward, under the leadership of His \r\nMajesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, King of \r\nBahrain, where free and fair elections were held with \r\nbroad participation. \r\n Meanwhile, its comprehensive development \r\nefforts were crowned by the United Nations presenting \r\nthe 2006 Special Citation of the United Nations Human \r\nSettlements Programme Scroll of Honour Award to His \r\nHighness Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Bahrain. This reflected \r\ninternational appreciation for the developments that \r\ncontinue to be witnessed by the Kingdom, especially in \r\nthe field of urban development. \r\n Social and economic achievements, under the \r\npatronage also of His Highness Shaikh Salman bin \r\nHamad Al-Khalifa, Crown Prince and Commander-in-\r\nChief of the Bahrain Defence Force, have continued \r\nunabated. They are based on strategies and policies \r\ndesigned to ensure the welfare of all citizens by \r\nencouraging investment, strengthening the national \r\nhuman rights machinery, reforming the labour market \r\nand developing the education sector. \r\n In the decades since the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations, our world has witnessed both unipolar \r\nand bipolar world orders. Worldwide events and the \r\nensuing results proved that such orders were not \r\nenough to guarantee security, peace, stability and \r\nprosperity in the world. Therefore, the time is now \r\nright to enable everybody to participate effectively in a \r\nuniversal system based on a just multilateralism that \r\nguarantees collective work towards achieving common \r\ngoals. \r\n We, as the United Nations, pledged in the \r\nCharter, in the name of our peoples to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to reaffirm \r\nfaith in fundamental human rights. That calls upon the \r\ninternational community promptly and effectively to \r\naddress threats to international peace and security. At \r\nthe forefront of those threats are the ongoing regional \r\nissues that the Middle East faces on various fronts, the \r\nmost important of which is the situation in the \r\nPalestinian and other occupied Arab territories. \r\n In this respect, we welcome the initiative of \r\nPresident George Bush of the United States to convene \r\nan international conference on Middle East peace this \r\nyear. We hope that this will mark the beginning of a \r\nnew stage in dealing with the core issue of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict in a just and equitable manner, putting \r\nan end to the suffering of the Palestinian people and to \r\nthe occupation since 1967 of the Palestinian territories, \r\nthe Syrian Golan and other occupied Arab territories in \r\nsisterly Lebanon. It should also lead to the \r\nestablishment of an independent, contiguous and viable \r\nPalestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. Such a \r\nState should also be able to engage in development and \r\nto live in peace and stability with all States in the \r\nregion, including Israel, in accordance with the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative, United Nations resolutions and other \r\nrelevant international agreements and terms of \r\nreference. \r\n The second front is represented by the events in \r\nbrotherly Iraq, whose people suffer from continued \r\ninsecurity and instability as a result of the ceaseless \r\nwaves of violence and the killing of innocent people. It \r\nis our view that the responsibility for breaking out of \r\nthis vicious circle and achieving national reconciliation \r\nand stability lies primarily with the Iraqi people and \r\ntheir political leadership. To enable Iraq to do that, \r\nthere must be no interference in Iraq’s internal affairs, \r\nand its borders must be fully respected. We stress here \r\nhow important it is for neighbouring States, the Arab \r\nLeague and the United Nations to continue to support \r\nthe legitimate Iraqi Government and its efforts to \r\nmaintain security and stability in Iraq and to preserve \r\nits Arab and Islamic identity. \r\n It seems clear that the attainment of stability in \r\nLebanon is closely bound to free national \r\nreconciliation, and to strengthened national, Arab and \r\ninternational efforts and support for Lebanon’s \r\nlegitimacy, with a view to preserving its security, \r\nsafety and stability. Lebanon is an integral part of the \r\nsystem of regional peace and security in the Middle \r\nEast and as such should be supported. We express our \r\nregret at the assassinations of many politicians, \r\nofficials and innocent people in Lebanon. We hope that \r\nLebanon will overcome the current crisis so that its \r\npeople can live in security and peace. \r\n The stability and unity of the Sudan are \r\nfundamental pillars of the political, economic and \r\nsocial unity of Africa. We commend the decision of the \r\nbrotherly Sudan to agree to the deployment of a United \r\nNations-African Union hybrid force in Darfur. In that \r\ncontext, we hope that the parties to the conflict in the \r\nSudan will come together for the sake of their country \r\nand its prosperity. \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n33 07-52121 \r\n \r\n The Kingdom of Bahrain recently joined the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), because \r\nof its belief in the Agency’s important role in \r\nstrengthening nuclear non-proliferation. In order to \r\navoid a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain underlines the importance of \r\nfreeing the region from nuclear weapons. It therefore \r\nurges the parties concerned, including the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, to be more transparent and to \r\ncooperate fully with the terms of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) so as to \r\nbuild tranquillity and peace of mind among \r\nneighbouring States in the Gulf. The Kingdom of \r\nBahrain reaffirms the right of all States to utilize \r\nnuclear power for peaceful purposes. It also demands \r\nthat Israel place all its nuclear facilities under the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the IAEA and \r\nbecome a party to the NPT in order to promote the \r\nTreaty’s universality. \r\n In order to promote friendly relations and \r\ncooperation between members of the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil (GCC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the right of the brotherly \r\nUnited Arab Emirates to recover its three occupied \r\nislands. It hopes that the two countries will increase \r\ntheir efforts and their contacts to resolve this issue \r\neither through direct negotiation or by referring it to \r\nthe International Court of Justice. \r\n Global climate change has become one of the \r\nmost dangerous challenges threatening the world and \r\nits inhabitants. Climate change not only has an impact \r\non the environment, but also severely affects the \r\nworld’s economic and social order and hinders \r\ndevelopment. We therefore call upon all States to \r\ncooperate in order to identify solutions and ways to \r\ndeal with this phenomenon. Here I wish to commend \r\nthe high-level event on climate change, convened by \r\nthe Secretary-General on 24 September 2007 in New \r\nYork, on the theme “The future in our hands: \r\nAddressing the leadership challenge of climate \r\nchange”. \r\n Our faith in a single human destiny requires us to \r\nconsolidate a culture of peace, brotherhood and \r\ndialogue among all nations and peoples and to abandon \r\nphenomena of hatred, discrimination and division — \r\nincluding what has been dubbed Islamophobia — \r\nwhich some are promoting to incite upheaval and \r\nhatred between peoples in order to serve their own \r\nnarrow political agendas and interests. Those \r\nindividuals forget that Islam is a monotheistic religion \r\nand that it stresses brotherhood, love, coexistence and \r\ntolerance. We hope in this context that the High-level \r\nDialogue to be held by the General Assembly on 4 and \r\n5 October will contribute to reinforcing the values of \r\ntolerance, understanding and respect for religions and \r\ncultures. \r\n The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the \r\nimportance of joint efforts towards a new international \r\nenvironment, in which we can achieve our hope and \r\naspiration to live in peace, security and stability in a \r\nworld in which mankind will also live in respect, \r\ndignity and humanity; a world in which nations will \r\nachieve development and build prosperity and well-\r\nbeing; a world that will accept the cultures of others in \r\npeaceful coexistence, free from hatred and intolerance; \r\nand a world that believes in the unity of human destiny \r\nand will work to attain security, prosperity, justice and \r\npeace for humankind. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. George Yeo, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Singapore. \r\n Mr. Yeo (Singapore): The item at the top of our \r\nagenda is climate change. The upcoming Bali \r\nConference needs our full support. Climate change is a \r\nchallenge that can only be overcome by our collective \r\nefforts. If we fail, the future will be troubled. Small \r\nisland countries like Singapore will be in great danger. \r\nPeople living in the lowlands will have to move to \r\nhigher ground. The pressure of migration into spaces \r\nwhich become more habitable because of global \r\nwarming may well become unstoppable. There will be \r\nnew conflicts in the world. \r\n We are coming now to understand better the role \r\nof climate change in the conflict in Darfur. It does not \r\nexcuse the heinous crimes that have been committed \r\nthere, but understanding the water situation in that \r\nregion will help us find more durable solutions for the \r\nfuture. Many historians are now reassessing the role of \r\nclimate change in major political events in the past. \r\nMr. Hannesson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We cannot be sure whether our best efforts can \r\nstop global warming. The Earth’s climate has always \r\ngone through cycles. But, even if all we can do is to \r\nslow down the process that will buy us time: time to \r\naccumulate knowledge, to develop new technologies \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 34 \r\n \r\nand to adapt. For example, the cost of recycling or \r\ndesalinating water has been steadily coming down and \r\nis becoming completely affordable for us in Singapore. \r\nImprovements in water technology can defuse political \r\ntensions in many parts of the world.  \r\n Many problems we face can only be overcome by \r\nthe nations of the world acting together. Climate \r\nchange is one. Another is the danger of global \r\npandemics, which must also be kept high on our \r\nagenda. The late Director-General of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO), Lee Jong-wook, once said that a \r\nnew global pandemic was not a question of “whether” \r\nbut of “when”. With the mass movement of human \r\nbeings, much of it at jet speed, a new bug can spread \r\nquickly.  \r\n Only a few years ago, we had the scare of Severe \r\nAcute Respiratory Syndrome. We are still not sure why \r\nthat epidemic burned out so quickly, but luckily it did. \r\nDuring the few months it hit us in Singapore, our \r\neconomy was severely affected. Our tourism industry \r\nwas devastated. As our economy is so dependent on \r\nexternal trade, shutting our airport was not an option. \r\nInstead, we hurriedly converted military night-vision \r\ndevices into thermal scanners and used them at the \r\nairport so that arriving and departing passengers with \r\nfever could be pulled aside for medical examination. \r\nWe knew we could not overcome this problem on our \r\nown. The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) convened an emergency meeting to \r\nwhich the Premier of China, the Chief Executive of \r\nHong Kong and the Director-General of WHO were \r\nalso invited. \r\n Whether it is climate change, global pandemics, \r\nthe fight against terrorism, the multilateral trading \r\nsystem or international finance, we need better global \r\ngovernance. During the cold war, the world was \r\ndivided into two camps with each super-Power taking \r\nthe lead in its own sphere. That era is now behind us. A \r\nmultipolar world is crystallizing. On no major issue \r\ncan one country, however powerful, now act on its \r\nown, completely disregarding the views of others. The \r\nsituation in Iraq is a sad example of that. Russia, \r\nChina, India and Brazil are emergent or re-emergent \r\nPowers whose interests must increasingly be factored \r\nin. Smaller countries too have become more assertive, \r\nrefusing to let bigger countries ride roughshod over \r\nthem.  \r\n When major international institutions like the \r\nUnited Nations, the World Bank, and the International \r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) were established many years \r\nago, after the end of the Second World War, the world \r\nwas very different from what it is today. Because of \r\nthis, those institutions are not as effective as they ought \r\nto be. However, we have to work with those \r\ninstitutions as they are and not as we would want them \r\nto be if they were to be newly established today. Unless \r\nthere is another global conflagration, the improvement \r\nof global governance can only be achieved through \r\ngradual evolution, not revolution. \r\n We can do that at two levels: at the level of the \r\nmajor Powers and at the level of small and medium-\r\nsized countries. At the level of the major Powers, \r\ninternational institutions should increasingly reflect the \r\nmultipolar reality. For example, the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, including the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, should take into account the weight of India, \r\nJapan, Germany and Brazil and the growing \r\nimportance of regional organizations. Selection of \r\nheads of the IMF and the World Bank should be \r\nwidened. Membership of the Group of Eight (G-8) \r\nshould be enlarged to include countries such as China \r\nand India. It is also important that international \r\norganizations be held to the highest standards of \r\nmanagement. We must maintain their moral authority \r\nin the eyes of the world if they are to stay effective. \r\nThat Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s recent visit to a \r\nrefugee camp in Darfur received so much applause was \r\nbecause of the prestige of the United Nations and the \r\nhope reposed in the Blue Helmets. \r\n On climate change, it is good that the United \r\nStates has convened a meeting in Washington of the \r\nworld’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. As the \r\nworld’s biggest economy, the United States has to \r\nexercise leadership. But it cannot do it on its own. \r\nWithout major emitters achieving a certain common \r\nunderstanding among themselves, we will not make \r\nmuch progress at the coming Climate Change \r\nConference in Bali.  \r\n The involvement of small and medium-sized \r\ncountries in international institutions has to be \r\nenhanced. It is unhealthy if the only way small and \r\nmedium-sized countries can ensure their interests are \r\ntaken into account is by threatening to block the \r\nprogress of others. Indeed, if every country in \r\ninternational organizations had the power of veto the \r\nresult would be paralysis. As a small country itself, \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n35 07-52121 \r\n \r\nSingapore takes the view that small and medium-sized \r\ncountries have both rights and responsibilities. We too \r\nmust have a sense of responsibility for the global \r\nsystem. A rules-based world gives us more freedom \r\nthan one where “might is right”. \r\n Regional groupings can help small and medium-\r\nsized countries strike this balance between rights and \r\nresponsibilities. The African Union offers a good \r\nexample of how the discipline of a group gives each of \r\nits members a greater say in world affairs than it could \r\nhave on its own. Group solidarity enables regional \r\norganizations such as ASEAN to play a bigger role in \r\nthe world. ASEAN will soon be strengthened by the \r\nleaders’ adoption of a formal charter next month.  \r\n Both formal and informal arrangements have \r\ntheir uses. For example, the Forum of Small States is a \r\nloose coalition of 100 countries that meet regularly to \r\nexchange views and to give support to one another. \r\nThey make up more than half the Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. Formal and informal groups can play a \r\nconstructive role by taking the middle ground and \r\nmoderating the excessive demands of radical members. \r\nLet us, through the groupings to which we belong, \r\nencourage each other towards compromise on the \r\nvarious issues. An example is the Doha Development \r\nAgenda. The positions are not so far apart now and it \r\nwould be a great pity to walk away from a Doha deal \r\nbecause of relatively small differences when the deal \r\ncould add hundreds of billions of dollars to global \r\nwelfare. \r\n However effective they are, international \r\ninstitutions cannot stop the natural rivalry among \r\nnation States. The major Powers will still throw their \r\nweight around, but rules can be established for \r\ncivilized behaviour and to prevent countries from \r\ntaking extreme actions that will endanger the planet we \r\nshare and our common heritage.  \r\n We are not a union of nations, but we are at the \r\nvery least a confederation of nations. There are limits \r\nto the sovereignty we exercise as independent nation-\r\nStates. For example, the countries of the world have \r\nnot only a legitimate right but also a responsibility to \r\ndecry the brutal suppression of demonstrators in \r\nMyanmar. Yesterday the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN \r\nexpressed our revulsion through a Chairman’s \r\nstatement which also called on the Myanmar \r\nGovernment to abandon its old ways and take a fresh \r\napproach towards national reconciliation with all \r\ngroups in the country. We applauded the initiative of \r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General to dispatch \r\nSpecial Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Myanmar and urged \r\nthe Myanmar Government to work with him for the \r\ngood of the people of the country. \r\n Six months before 11 September 2001, the people \r\nof the world watched with shock and horror the \r\ndeliberate destruction of the ancient Buddha statues in \r\nBamiyan by the Taliban. We must never allow such \r\nwanton acts to take place again, whether the injury is \r\nto world heritage sites, to the environment or to human \r\nbeings.  \r\n Behind such acts is an attitude of hatred and \r\nintolerance that must never be condoned. If this \r\ncentury is to be one of peace and development, all of \r\nus must internalize a spirit of interfaith understanding \r\nand common humanity. Recently, the Indian \r\nGovernment announced its intention to revive the \r\nancient Buddhist university at Nalanda and offered it to \r\nAsian countries as a project to promote cultural and \r\nreligious understanding and exchange. For hundreds of \r\nyears Nalanda was a great university drawing students \r\nfrom all over Asia to study not just Buddhism but also \r\nphilosophy, science, mathematics and other subjects. \r\nThat project deserves our support. \r\n We need many such endeavours in the world \r\ntoday so as to create a greater awareness of our \r\ncommon origins, our growing interdependence and our \r\ncommon future. Without that larger sense, the \r\nchallenge of global governance will be difficult to \r\novercome. Without all countries feeling a sense of \r\nshared responsibility for the Earth’s environment, for \r\nexample, climate change will become much worse \r\nbefore effective measures are taken, by which time it \r\nmay be too late for many of us. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sergei Martynov, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Belarus. \r\n Mr. Martynov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): All \r\nof us seated in this Hall witnessed the collapse almost \r\ntwo decades ago of a seemingly invincible \r\ninternational system based on the antagonism of two \r\npoles of power. It collapsed instantly. The system that \r\nensued, based on the antagonism of one powerful pole \r\nto the rest of the world, is already splitting apart before \r\nour very eyes and creating strains that will inevitably \r\nlead to its collapse. Simple logic, which does not aspire \r\nto explain the laws of the universe, tells us that systems \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 36 \r\n \r\nbased on confrontation are short-lived. They are \r\ndoomed. But this is not the end of history: this is a \r\nprocess of history. As the twenty-first century begins, \r\nsystems based on antagonism and confrontation are \r\nbecoming a thing of the past. The sands of time are \r\ninexorably flowing out of them. New international \r\nsystems based on partnership must replace them. \r\n Those thoughts are not a digression into the \r\nabstract. Though still split by the old paradigm of \r\nNorth-South confrontation and the imposed myth of \r\nconfrontation between developed and developing \r\nStates, and the myth of a clash of civilizations, the \r\ninternational community should through its actions \r\ntoday build a practical partnership that will lay the \r\nfoundations of new systems for the world order. When \r\nwe succeed in working together, we will be able to \r\ntackle the most serious problems. \r\n Let us take the subject of terrorism. Force alone, \r\neven the most powerful and the most sophisticated, \r\ncannot overcome terrorism. Its use instead causes a \r\nfurther spiral of terror. We have all painfully come to \r\nrealize this. Instead, we have understood the true \r\nimpact of poverty, inequality, social vulnerability and \r\nilliteracy on the rise of extremism and terrorism and \r\nhave taken up the fight against terrorism through joint \r\nand comprehensive efforts, and have thus started to \r\nundermine the very foundations of terrorism. The \r\ndecisive role in this, in our opinion, belongs to the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The United Nations must also reassert its leading \r\nrole in the fight against such growing evils as \r\ntrafficking in human beings and bring about \r\ncooperation between the countries of origin and \r\ncountries of destination of modern-day slaves. Having, \r\nin 2006, taken the first steps towards coordinating the \r\nefforts of the international community in this sphere \r\n(see resolution 61/180), the General Assembly should \r\noffer to its intergovernmental and non-governmental \r\npartners a practical vision of a global partnership in \r\nthis fight. As an optimal form of such a partnership, \r\nBelarus would opt for a United Nations plan of action \r\nor strategy to counter human trafficking and other \r\nmodern forms of slavery. Let us determine the optimal \r\nformat for our cooperation through a thematic General \r\nAssembly debate and begin this without delay during \r\nthe current session. \r\n We are certain that it is time for our common \r\nOrganization, the United Nations, to begin looking for \r\nways, obviously based on cooperation, to deal with \r\nwhat is de facto the most topical problem facing \r\nhumankind: the energy problem. Antagonism between \r\nsuppliers and consumers of energy resources and a \r\nprice race will not resolve the energy problem. Such \r\nantagonism is itself a superficial phenomenon. At the \r\nend of the day, we are all energy consumers, and this, \r\nin principle, is where we have common interests. How \r\nare we to solve this problem, given the rapid pace of \r\ngrowth of the world economy and the consequent rush \r\nfor energy sources? It is clear that the future belongs to \r\nalternative and renewable sources of energy. This \r\nmeans that today the United Nations must work out \r\npractical arrangements for the transfer and distribution \r\nof alternative and renewable energy technologies on a \r\nglobal scale. That is a fundamental prerequisite for the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n Such practical measures should include the \r\nmethods of dealing with the obvious problem that these \r\ntechnologies are concentrated in the hands of a small \r\ngroup of States. Otherwise, the pricing for these \r\ntechnologies tomorrow will emulate today’s exorbitant \r\nprices for traditional energy resources. If a few decades \r\nago the international community drew on the \r\nenlightened minds of researchers and managed to \r\ndecide that a future controlled fusion technology, as a \r\nperpetual source of energy, should belong to all \r\nhumanity, why can the United Nations today not take a \r\nsimilar decision with respect to alternative and \r\nrenewable sources of energy? It would probably be \r\nright to hold, during the next session of the General \r\nAssembly, informal thematic debates on technologies \r\nfor alternative and renewable energy resources as the \r\ncommon property of humankind. \r\n The problem of global climate change — a key \r\ntopic for this year’s general debate — is becoming \r\nincreasingly acute. At present, the Kyoto Protocol is \r\nthe most important international instrument for \r\naddressing this issue. In 2006, with an eye to full-\r\nfledged participation in the Kyoto Protocol, Belarus \r\nbecame the first and so far the only country to initiate \r\nan amendment to annex-B of the Protocol. In view of \r\nthe worsening problem of climate change and \r\nincorporating the wishes of our partners, we have \r\nundertaken the most stringent commitments on the \r\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region. \r\nThrough joint efforts by the parties to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, let us ensure prompt ratification of the \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n37 07-52121 \r\n \r\namendment and its entry into force, thereby setting a \r\nmajor practical precedent by enlarging the circle of \r\nparticipants in the Kyoto Protocol.  \r\n The fact that Belarus takes climate change and \r\nenvironmental protection issues so seriously is not \r\naccidental. Like our neighbours, the Russian \r\nFederation and Ukraine, for the past two decades now \r\nBelarus has had to deal with the consequences of the \r\ndeadliest man-made disaster of the twentieth century, \r\nthe accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. \r\nThanks to great effort and at tremendous cost the most \r\nurgent problems of providing emergency assistance to \r\nthe population today have been dealt with. In the years \r\nto come we will face an equally challenging task, \r\nnamely, to restore the economic potential of the \r\naffected areas and to create a viable environment for \r\npeople and pollution-free production. As before, we \r\nwill bear the main burden ourselves. However, we hope \r\nthat the proposed proclamation by the United Nations \r\nof a decade of rehabilitation and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of Chernobyl-affected areas, which was \r\nendorsed by the 2006 Minsk Chernobyl International \r\nConference, will have the support of the Assembly and \r\nthat a new resolution of the General Assembly will \r\nofficially announce the beginning of the decade of \r\nChernobyl, thus ensuring the cooperation and solidarity \r\nof the international community. \r\n From this rostrum much has been said about the \r\nproblems of the Doha round of negotiations on \r\ninternational trade. There is one more aspect of this \r\nsubject, the unacceptable practice of certain countries \r\nthat use the process of accession to membership of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) as a convenient \r\ninstrument of pressure on candidate countries. This has \r\ninvolved not only economic pressure, in order to \r\nreceive coerced and unilateral additional benefits from \r\nWTO expansion, but also political pressure. The \r\nUnited Nations must take a firm stand in favour of \r\nestablishing, with the participation of all interested \r\nStates, fair conditions for WTO accession that take into \r\naccount the trade and financial needs of the acceding \r\ncountries and their genuine development needs. \r\n Belarus rejects the use of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures in international relations as an instrument of \r\npolitical and economic pressure on sovereign States. \r\nSuch measures not only contradict the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law but breed \r\nalienation, mistrust and hostility among nations. We \r\nend up dealing with simply absurd situations when \r\neconomic sanctions are imposed under the pretext of \r\npromoting workers’ rights but lead ultimately to job \r\nlosses. By applying increasingly unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures of economic pressure, including \r\nextraterritorially, the well-known world centre of \r\npower has assumed de facto the rights of the United \r\nNations Security Council. We have all witnessed this \r\nduring the current general debate in the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n We wish to draw the attention of the General \r\nAssembly to a particular aspect, the abuse by the \r\nUnited States of the right to be the world reserve \r\ncurrency manager and its deliberate creation of \r\nobstacles to the lawful economic activity of legitimate \r\ncompanies and banks from countries that are not \r\ndeemed acceptable by the United States. This is a \r\nwake-up call for the entire international community. By \r\ndesignating States at will as acceptable or \r\nunacceptable, as good or bad, the United States is \r\ncreating an atmosphere that suppresses dissent and \r\ndiversity in international relations. That not only brings \r\nideology and politicking into international relations but \r\nis an act of confrontation with each and every one who \r\ndares to have an independent opinion or who has the \r\ncourage to pursue an independent foreign policy. The \r\nmajority in this hall are member States of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM). They are non-aligned \r\nto confrontation. Five decades ago the creation of the \r\nMovement was a protest against confrontation and a \r\nglobal response to the global challenge of \r\nconfrontation. Today it is within our power to stop \r\nconfrontation and to reject the solutions that it seeks to \r\nimpose. Tomorrow belongs to positive ideas and \r\nactions and to interaction and cooperation for peace in \r\nthe common interest of the entire international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Abdelelah Al-Khatib, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. \r\n Mr. Al-Khatib (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme to congratulate the President on his assumption of \r\nthe presidency of this session of the General Assembly \r\nand wish him every success in leading its deliberations. \r\nI should also like to extend my thanks to his \r\npredecessor Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her \r\ngood management of the deliberations of the previous \r\nsession. I would also like to express my sincere thanks \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\nunrelenting efforts since he assumed his office to \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 38 \r\n \r\nadvance the work of the Organization and activate its \r\nrole in the service of international peace and security. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The Middle East region, of which Jordan is an \r\nintegral part, continues to face formidable challenges \r\nstemming from the failure to make any progress \r\ntowards solving its main regional issues. Jordan, \r\nhowever, has realized that these challenges should not \r\nbecome a justification for abandoning its national \r\npriorities regarding political and economic reform and \r\nfor achieving the highest degree of openness and \r\nparticipation. Therefore, Jordan has adopted a national \r\nstrategy that strikes a balance between continuing to \r\neffect reform and protecting its national security. \r\n Jordan has also continued to deal with regional \r\nissues on the basis of its belief that it is necessary to \r\nreach just solutions by peaceful means and in a way \r\nthat protects the rights of all concerned and that \r\nachieves regional stability. Jordan is firmly convinced \r\nthat the use of military force and the imposition of \r\nunilateral solutions lead only to the aggravation of \r\nproblems, increase the suffering of the people and \r\nthreaten regional and international stability. \r\n The Palestinian question, which is at the core of \r\nthe Middle East conflict, is now at a decisive \r\ncrossroads: either the regional parties and the \r\ninternational community succeed in making real and \r\ntangible progress and reach a just and lasting solution \r\nwithin a reasonable and agreed-upon time frame, or the \r\nentire region will be swept into extremism and anarchy, \r\nwhich will be a grave threat to world peace and \r\nsecurity. Therefore, the international meeting \r\nscheduled to be held before the end of this year may be \r\nthe last chance to make that progress. This makes it \r\nimperative for the United States, which called for that \r\nconference, the members of the International Quartet \r\nand the regional parties to prepare for it well, ensuring \r\nthat final status issues between Palestine and Israel are \r\nseriously discussed and in a way that will allow real \r\nprogress to be made on those issues and a lasting \r\nagreement to be reached and implemented quickly \r\nwithin a time frame agreed upon by the two parties. \r\n The situation in the region cannot withstand the \r\ncontinuation of developments that do not allow for real \r\nprogress. The holding of international and regional \r\nmeetings and negotiations should not be an end in itself \r\nbut rather a means to an end, namely reaching a real \r\npeace, accepted and preserved by the peoples of the \r\nregion. Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been going \r\non for a long time. The whole world knows that records \r\nof those negotiations contain alternatives that provide \r\nsolutions for final status issues. What is needed now is \r\nthe political will to reach an agreement instead of \r\nlooking for pretexts and prolonging the negotiations.  \r\n Israel will never enjoy the security it seeks and \r\nthe Middle East region will not enjoy stability unless \r\nthe Palestinian people recover their national rights \r\nthrough the establishment of an independent, \r\ncontiguous and viable Palestinian state in the \r\nPalestinian territories occupied in 1967, including East \r\nJerusalem, and unless other Arab occupied territories \r\nare returned. The current situation in the Palestinian \r\nterritories is not at all in harmony with the wish to \r\nachieve peace. In order to give the impression of \r\nhonest movement towards peace, settlement activities \r\nmust stop immediately, as must tampering with the \r\nstatus of East Jerusalem, including stopping all \r\nexcavations in the Jerusalem holy sanctuary at Haram \r\nal-Sharif and putting an end to all practices that violate \r\ninternational law, in particular the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention. \r\n Achievement of the desired progress requires a \r\nvast change to the tragic situation experienced by the \r\nPalestinians living in the occupied territories. There is \r\nan immediate need to revive the Palestinian economy \r\nin a manner that would lead to launching investment, \r\ncreating vital projects and providing work \r\nopportunities. That revival will not materialize unless \r\nthe Palestinians enjoy freedom of movement, which \r\nrequires ending the closures, removing security \r\nroadblocks and stopping military operations. It is also \r\nimperative to enable the Palestinian National Authority, \r\nled by President Mahmoud Abbas and his legitimate \r\nGovernment, to rebuild its institutions so as to succeed \r\nin executing its national programmes, which deserve \r\nfinancial support from the international community. \r\n A united and stable Iraq constitutes an essential \r\ncomponent of balance and stability in the region. While \r\nJordan welcomes the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1770 (2007), it supports the United Nations \r\nplaying a central role in ensuring reconciliation and \r\nstability in that country. The preservation of any \r\nachievements on the security front will be \r\naccomplished only within an appropriate political \r\nenvironment, and this will necessitate real national \r\nreconciliation that will guarantee the participation of \r\nall segments of the Iraqi people in a political process \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n39 07-52121 \r\n \r\nbased on reviving Iraqi nationalism rather than \r\nsectarianism and ethnicity. It must be founded on the \r\nbasis of the unity of the State and the sole right of the \r\nState to maintain security and ban militias from \r\nencroaching on that exclusive right. Moreover, we \r\nmust prevent any interference in Iraq’s internal affairs, \r\nwhilst implementing what has been agreed upon, \r\nincluding a review of the Constitution and other laws \r\nand the building of national security and government \r\ninstitutions. \r\n The fact that huge numbers of Iraqis have been \r\nforced to leave their country puts a tremendous burden \r\non neighbouring countries, including Jordan. Jordan \r\ncontinues to host hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, with \r\nall the pressures that this imposes on Jordan’s \r\neconomy, resources and infrastructure, with little help \r\nfrom the international community. While we call on the \r\ninternational community to stand by us in dealing with \r\nthis huge burden, we believe that a lasting solution to \r\nthis problem lies in restoring stability to Iraq, so that \r\nits citizens can return to their country and contribute to \r\nits reconstruction.  \r\n Jordan and the Arab Group condemn the \r\nassassinations that have taken place in Lebanon, the \r\nlatest of which being the assassination of member of \r\nParliament Antoine Ghanem, a few days ago. These \r\nassassinations reflect the dangerous situation in that \r\ncountry and highlight the need for the international \r\ncommunity to take a firm stand in putting an end to \r\nthese grave violations of Lebanese sovereignty and to \r\ntake all measures to stop any foreign interference in its \r\ninternal affairs. This will ensure that the Lebanese \r\npeople will find appropriate solutions through their \r\nconstitutional institutions so as to ensure internal \r\nlegitimacy, including the holding of presidential \r\nelections in accordance with the Constitution and \r\nwithin the time frame provided therein. \r\n Jordan is working today within the Group of \r\nEleven, which was launched at the initiative of His \r\nMajesty King Abdullah II to establish economic \r\ncooperation and support the development process of \r\nlower-middle income countries. We look forward to \r\nworking with other States and groups of States, \r\nincluding, in particular, the Group of Eight (G-8), in \r\norder to establish cooperation that will enable the \r\nGroup of Eleven members to preserve their economic \r\naccomplishments and achieve a breakthrough that will \r\nlead to success in attaining sustainable development. \r\n Confronting extremism and terrorism requires \r\nmore effective international cooperation as well as \r\nactivating channels of cultural and religious dialogue, \r\nespecially within the United Nations system. At the \r\nsame time, there is an urgent need to refrain from \r\nIslamophobia and from inciting animosity against this \r\ntolerant divine religion. Today’s world requires a more \r\neffective United Nations role in addressing \r\ninternational challenges, such as human rights, \r\narmaments, climate change, terrorism, international \r\ncrime, poverty, hunger, infectious diseases, and \r\nincreasing factional, sectarian and ethnic conflicts. In \r\nthis context, we emphasize the importance of building \r\nupon what has been achieved, and we call for \r\nadvancing the process of reform of the United Nations \r\nand its agencies in order to enable them to enhance \r\ntheir performance. We view the reform process as vital \r\nand of the highest priority. Jordan will continue to play \r\na constructive role in this area and will continue to \r\noffer reasonable and applicable visions, especially \r\nwithin the context of reforming the work mechanisms \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n Finally, I assure the Assembly that Jordan will \r\nkeep its commitments to the achievement of \r\ninternational peace and security. The size of the \r\nJordanian forces participating in peacekeeping \r\noperations and their geographically wide deployment \r\nreflect the actual role of Jordan in the United Nations \r\nsystem and reflect also its political will to help \r\naccomplish the mission of the Organization. We take \r\nthis commitment very seriously and place the \r\nresources, professionalism and discipline of our armed \r\nforces at the service of international peace and security. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Miguel Angel Moratinos Cuyaubé, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of \r\nSpain. \r\n Mr. Moratinos Cuyaubé (Spain) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Mr. President, at the outset I wish to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \r\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly. It \r\nis a great pleasure for me to address the General \r\nAssembly for the third time in order to take stock of \r\nthe actions of the international community and to \r\nexpress commitment and share our thoughts regarding \r\nthe priorities on our agenda. \r\n When this world forum was created six decades \r\nago, it was an expression of will and necessity; out of \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 40 \r\n \r\nwill came commitment and out of necessity came \r\nawareness. The States represented here today are more \r\ncommitted and are more conscious than ever of the \r\nneed to advance in establishing peace, combating \r\npoverty, protecting human rights, and furthering \r\ndemocracy and international law.  \r\n In our complex and uncertain world new and old \r\nchallenges, new and old conflicts exist simultaneously. \r\nOur cooperation has improved in quality, but poverty \r\ncontinues to affect a large sector of the world’s \r\npopulation. We are moving forward in promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights, but gross violations persist. \r\nWe seek peace, prosperity and dignity for all. What \r\nmeasures and instruments do we have to meet these \r\nchallenges? How can we adapt them in order to \r\nrespond more effectively?  \r\n Today, we know that no State alone can \r\neffectively address the global agenda and guarantee \r\nhuman development in a world that is increasingly \r\nuncertain and interdependent — though no less \r\nstimulating and creative for that. The means exist at the \r\nuniversal, regional and bilateral levels, as well as at the \r\nlevel of our many interrelationships. The structures and \r\norganizations that the international community has \r\nbuilt with so much effort form a complex framework \r\nthat we must reform, strengthen and update. Spain \r\npromotes effective multilateralism inspired by values \r\nand principles sustained by the people. The \r\ninternational community recognizes the need for a \r\ngreater political consensus and effective cooperation, a \r\ntrend seen within the United Nations system as well as \r\nin regional structures such as the European Union \r\n(EU), the Iberoamerican Community of Nations, or the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE). Spain participates in those organizations, \r\nwhere optimism on progress is tangible. Despite the \r\nsometimes slow pace of progress, there is a global \r\npolitical awareness of the challenges affecting \r\ndemography, sustainable human and economic \r\ndevelopment and their link to climate change. \r\n Peace is possible and necessary — real peace, not \r\njust the absence of war. We need to clear the way for \r\npeace and political reason in the Middle East, a region \r\nfraught with violence and dramatic tension, which in \r\nturn affects the security and confidence of the \r\ninternational community. We must choose the power of \r\nwords over that of arms, trust over mistrust, \r\ncommitment over fear and dialogue and effective \r\nconcerted action over disagreement. Spain wishes to \r\nhelp the parties and joins with the Quartet and its \r\nrepresentative in seeking a final solution. In order to do \r\nthis, we must establish an open dialogue without \r\npreconditions and draw renewed inspiration from the \r\nMadrid Conference. For peace to be complete, it must \r\ninclude Syria and Lebanon.  \r\n The meeting proposed by President Bush is an \r\nappropriate occasion to formalize everyone’s \r\ncommitment to this desired peace. Spain unreservedly \r\nsupports that initiative.  \r\n We wish for a peaceful, viable and democratic \r\nPalestinian State, living in peace with Israel, and an \r\nIsrael that is secure and has good relations in its region. \r\nThe international community must support and assist \r\nparties in their efforts. Spain is firmly determined to \r\nmake its contribution effective. \r\n Spain’s commitment in the region is also \r\ndemonstrated by its participation in the United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). I truly hope that \r\nthe Lebanese political forces will reach a consensus \r\nresolution of their political crisis without interference. \r\nI appeal for a political agreement in the name of peace, \r\nin the national interest of Lebanon and in the interest \r\nof the region. \r\n The conflict in Western Sahara is one of the main \r\nobstacles to the integration process of the Arab \r\nMaghreb Union. We are actively committed to seeking \r\na just and final political agreement that respects the \r\nprinciple of self-determination within the framework of \r\nthe United Nations. Spain trusts that with the \r\nassistance of the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy \r\nand the support of friendly nations, all parties will \r\nmake progress and that the direct negotiations that \r\nhave already been initiated will culminate in an \r\nagreement. \r\n Constructive trust is fundamental, and that was \r\nbehind the dialogue forum on Gibraltar in which \r\nimportant agreements were reached on matters of local \r\ncooperation of benefit to all. Spain hopes to make \r\nprogress in reaching a final solution to the sovereignty \r\ndispute in accordance with the resolutions and \r\ndecisions of the United Nations.  \r\n We have seen uneven progress in conflicts with a \r\nhistory of devastation and violence. We have also seen \r\nprogress and change in conflicts that had been \r\ndeadlocked, such as those in Georgia, Nagorny \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n41 07-52121 \r\n \r\nKarabakh and Transdniestria, as well as in that relating \r\nto the status of Kosovo.  \r\n Peace is possible and necessary, and we are \r\nmoving towards it despite being hit by terrorism, which \r\nposes a serious threat to peace and security. This global \r\nviolence aims at undermining the stability of free and \r\ndemocratic societies and, as we agreed a year ago in \r\nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\n(resolution 60/288), we must prevail over that violence \r\nby coordinating our efforts and responding collectively. \r\nWe are pleased that, in our determination to defeat \r\nterrorism, victims and their families have not been \r\nforgotten, and that the international community \r\ncontinues to urge respect for them. I believe that this is \r\na well deserved acknowledgement and that without it \r\nthe strategy against global terrorism would be \r\nincomplete. \r\n Spain participates in peacekeeping operations \r\nauthorized and mandated by the Security Council, in \r\nLebanon, Afghanistan and the Balkans. Allow me, here \r\nin the General Assembly, to express my gratitude to the \r\nSpanish armed forces, the State security forces and \r\nothers engaged in cooperative efforts for their work \r\nand solidarity in favour of peace. In particular, I pay \r\nheartfelt tribute to those Spaniards who have lost their \r\nlives in this effort and to their families and friends; \r\nonly four days ago two Spanish soldiers died in \r\nAfghanistan. To assist in the logistics of peacekeeping \r\noperations, Spain has offered to establish a United \r\nNations support base in Quart de Poblet in Valencia. A \r\ncommunications centre will be established there for the \r\ndevelopment of peacekeeping operations on the \r\nground. \r\n It is possible to defeat poverty. It is an ethical and \r\npolitical duty, a duty that Spain is firmly determined to \r\nshoulder. I am pleased and proud to say that my \r\ncountry today is the eighth-largest contributor to the \r\nUnited Nations system; our goal is to devote 0.7 per \r\ncent of our gross domestic product to development aid \r\nby 2012. In only three years, backed by political and \r\nsocial consensus, we have reinforced cooperation and \r\nincreased its volume — to nearly €4.5 billion this year. \r\nSpain has expressed profound solidarity with and \r\ncommitment to the goals set forth in the alliance \r\nagainst hunger and poverty.  \r\n We want access to drinking water and sanitation \r\nto be a universally enjoyed right. Water will be the \r\ncentral theme at International Expo Zaragoza 2008. \r\nThat event will give participating countries and visitors \r\ninsights into the fundamental aspects of water in the \r\ntwenty-first century, such as the environment, \r\ninternational cooperation and prospects for scientific, \r\ntechnological and economic management. I encourage \r\nand invite members to participate in the 2008 Zaragoza \r\nexposition on water and sustainable development. \r\n Spain wishes to assist in the structural \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and believes that \r\ninstitutional and managerial reform taking account of \r\nglobal civil society inputs is a priority. \r\n That comment, Mr. President, is intended to \r\nhighlight the progress made on the Security Council \r\nissue at the sixty-first session of the General Assembly, \r\nduring the mandate of your predecessor. It is essential \r\nfor this very sensitive aspect of reform to be resolved \r\nthrough a political decision adopted by consensus, and \r\nnot in haste.  \r\n We welcome the Human Rights Council as a \r\nforum to debate issues related to rights and freedoms. \r\nSpain reiterates its trust in that body and its desire to \r\nbecome a member next year. The protection and \r\npromotion of human rights is a fundamental pillar of \r\nSpain’s foreign policy, because we are convinced that \r\nthe violation of these rights leads to oppression and \r\nviolence. We hope for the adoption at this session of a \r\ndraft resolution on the abolition of the death penalty or, \r\nat the very least, on a universal moratorium. \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations will mobilize the \r\ninternational community and global civil society to end \r\nthe risk of polarization caused by the prejudices, \r\nerroneous ideas and extremism that can disrupt \r\npeaceful coexistence. Mr. Jorge Sampaio, the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, has presented \r\nan implementation plan programme, and a trust fund \r\nfor voluntary contributions has been set up with the \r\nsupport of the Group of Friends, involving more than \r\n70 States and international organizations. \r\n This has been a good year for Spain, and we \r\nwould like to share it with the international community. \r\nOur presence abroad has increased due to the active \r\ninvolvement of our citizens and our institutions, \r\neconomic stability and business activity, all of which \r\nhas been conducive to greater openness to the rest of \r\nthe world. This is not the time to be discouraged; \r\nrather, it is a time for commitment and optimism. An \r\nobjective and rational analysis of the progress that the \r\ninternational community has made in recent years \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 42 \r\n \r\nshould inspire hope and strengthen the will to work \r\ntowards the development of a balanced agenda that \r\naddresses the challenges of our times. The States \r\nmembers of the General Assembly are more aware than \r\never that only through united action in solidarity can \r\nwe meet these challenges effectively by using political \r\ndialogue, preventive diplomacy and public and \r\nhumanitarian diplomacy. Spain sees the situation as \r\npositive. In that regard I would quote the Spanish poet \r\nBlas de Otero: “I ask for peace and I ask to speak ... in \r\ndefence of man and his justice”. That means a \r\ncommitment to action, not rhetoric. \r\n The President: I call on His Excellency Mr. Song \r\nMin-soon, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nthe Republic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Song Min-soon (Republic of Korea): I \r\nshould like first to offer my warmest congratulations to \r\nyou, Mr. Kerim, on your assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I \r\nam confident that under your distinguished leadership \r\nwe will achieve great results during this important \r\nsession. I take this opportunity to assure you of the \r\nRepublic of Korea’s full support for your noble \r\nendeavours.  \r\n I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\nexcellent service during his first year in office. Based \r\non long experience of working closely with him, His \r\nExcellency President Roh Moo-hyun of the Republic of \r\nKorea and I have every confidence that he will \r\ncontinue to fulfil his role with distinction. \r\n Today’s global challenges require a collective \r\nresponse. Ever-widening globalization has brought \r\nwith it a growing role for the United Nations. By virtue \r\nof its universality, the United Nations is the right body \r\nto deal with these global issues. No other organization \r\ncan provide the legitimacy and authority that the \r\nUnited Nations offers. The United Nations has played \r\nan indispensable role in setting international norms and \r\nprinciples. It has pointed States and peoples in the right \r\ndirection. By enhancing predictability and rule-based \r\ninteraction between and among nations, the United \r\nNations is able to prevent conflicts of interest from \r\nerupting into crises. Those are the quiet successes of \r\nthe United Nations that often go unnoticed, precisely \r\nbecause the Organization helps to keep the \r\ninternational system running smoothly. This aspect of \r\nthe work of the United Nations deserves full \r\nrecognition and should be further strengthened.  \r\n At the same time, the United Nations can do \r\nbetter. We should persist in our efforts to strengthen the \r\nworld body through reform. This will be essential in \r\nenabling the United Nations to respond effectively to \r\nthe most daunting challenges of our era. As steps \r\ntowards achieving that end, the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Korea fully supports the important \r\ninitiatives that the Secretary-General has taken to \r\npromote the efficiency, effectiveness and \r\naccountability of the Secretariat. In particular, we \r\nappreciate his strenuous efforts to lead by example in \r\nchanging the Secretariat’s working culture. \r\n Development, human rights and peace and \r\nsecurity are the three pillars of the United Nations. \r\nThey are all imperatives, and they are mutually \r\nreinforcing. Let me begin with development. The \r\nMillennium Development Goals agreed upon by our \r\nleaders in 2000 have a target year of 2015. We are \r\nalready at the midpoint. It is essential that we assess \r\nthe current situation and renew our commitment. But \r\nsuch actions will not be enough on their own. We need \r\nto identify more effective means to fulfil those \r\ncommitments.  \r\n The Republic of Korea has been redoubling its \r\nefforts to enhance its official development assistance \r\n(ODA). We have committed ourselves to a threefold \r\nincrease by 2015 from our current ODA level. To \r\nfurther support the international effort to eradicate \r\npoverty, we have joined the air-ticket solidarity levy \r\ninitiative, an innovative source of financing for \r\ndevelopment. At the same time, drawing lessons from \r\nour own history of development, we place emphasis \r\nnot only on increasing the scale of our aid but also on \r\neffectively sharing our experience with developing \r\ncountries. \r\n An issue closely related to development is \r\nclimate change. There is a growing consensus that \r\nclimate change is placing serious constraints on \r\nworldwide development capacity. It affects everyone \r\neverywhere. Therefore it must be urgently addressed. I \r\nhope that the political will shown by the leaders of \r\nmore than 150 nations at the gathering held here on \r\nMonday, 24 September, leads to the adoption of a road \r\nmap to a post-2012 regime of realistic, tangible \r\nsolutions to this pressing concern. They should be \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n43 07-52121 \r\n \r\ncomprehensive and flexible enough to ensure \r\nparticipation by as many countries as possible. \r\n Turning to human rights, it is vital that the \r\nHuman Rights Council live up to the high expectations \r\nthat surrounded its creation. We must do all we can to \r\nenable the Council to make real progress in the \r\npromotion of human rights. Let us renew our \r\ncommitment and strengthen our joint efforts to ensure \r\nits success. As an inaugural member of the Council, the \r\nRepublic of Korea is fully committed to the principle \r\nof all human rights for all.  \r\n In that regard my Government is deeply \r\nconcerned about the current situation in Myanmar and \r\nthe loss of civilian lives during the continuing protests. \r\nWe strongly hope that the Government and the people \r\nof Myanmar will work together peacefully towards \r\ndemocratization and national reconciliation.  \r\n My Government has substantially increased its \r\nefforts to eliminate discrimination against vulnerable \r\ngroups such as women, children and persons with \r\ndisabilities. We have vigorously pushed for necessary \r\nlegislation and the improvement of institutional \r\nframeworks to protect and promote the rights of such \r\nindividuals. Also, we adopted a national action plan for \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights in May \r\nthis year. \r\n In the area of peace and security, United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions are continuing to grow in \r\nimportance as well as in the size and scope of their \r\nactivities. The strengthened United Nations Interim \r\nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL), operating in southern \r\nLebanon, and the deployment of the African Union-\r\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur are two \r\nprominent examples. \r\n Indeed, the rising demand for peacekeeping and \r\nthe broad support of the international community are \r\nclear evidence of the crucial role of the United Nations \r\nin maintaining peace and security. For our part, the \r\nRepublic of Korea’s recent participation in UNIFIL \r\ntestifies once again to our firm commitment to United \r\nNations peacekeeping activities. We will make every \r\neffort to enable our well-trained and disciplined \r\nKorean contingents to contribute further to \r\npeacekeeping activities.  \r\n Peace cannot be sustained without development. \r\nA comprehensive approach is required in order to make \r\nthe fragile peace of post-conflict situations durable and \r\nirreversible. With the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the critical task of \r\nconsolidating peace and development has been \r\ninstitutionalized. In that regard, I believe that the \r\nexperience of the Republic of Korea over the past half \r\ncentury in rebuilding the nation from the ashes of war \r\nsince the 1950s could provide useful insights and \r\nencouragements that might help the post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding activities of the United Nations. \r\n Terrorism continues to be one of the gravest \r\nchallenges of our times. The Republic of Korea \r\nstrongly condemns terrorism in all forms, committed \r\nby whomever, wherever and for whatever purpose. We \r\nfully support the ongoing global anti-terrorism efforts. \r\nThe Republic of Korea is party to 12 existing anti-\r\nterrorism conventions, while being in the process of \r\nratifying the latest International Convention for the \r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We are also \r\nof the view that the United Nations should lose no \r\nmore time in concluding a comprehensive convention \r\non terrorism. \r\n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\n(WMDs) and their delivery systems poses an \r\never-increasing threat to the international community. \r\nTo curb WMD proliferation, our highest priority must \r\nbe to restore the integrity and relevance of the global \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. In fact the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) \r\nregime is at a crossroads. It has faced unprecedented \r\nchallenges in recent years. In responding to those \r\nchallenges we need to pool our wisdom to strengthen \r\nthe current nuclear non-proliferation regime. The \r\ninherent deficiencies in the NPT should be remedied, \r\nand effective multilateral tools should be further \r\ndeveloped to better serve the purposes of both nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy.  \r\n As home to the world’s sixth-largest civil nuclear \r\nenergy industry, the Republic of Korea regards the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy as crucial to our \r\nsustainable energy supply and economic development. \r\nThat is all the more reason why we support \r\nstrengthened safeguards against possible proliferation \r\nas a guarantee of the expanded use of nuclear energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes. \r\n Among the proliferation challenges facing the \r\ninternational community, the nuclear issue of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea requires our \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 44 \r\n \r\nimmediate attention. That problem, if not resolved \r\nsoon, will seriously undermine the NPT regime. It also \r\nhas significant implications for peace and security in \r\nNorth-East Asia and beyond. The Six-Party Talks are \r\nthe main vehicle through which to resolve the nuclear \r\nissue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nThat process has made significant progress since its \r\nlaunch in 2003. In the Joint Statement of September \r\n2005, the six nations agreed on a blueprint for the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The \r\nAgreement on Initial Actions, of February this year, \r\ntook that consensus another step forward, laying out \r\nspecific actions to implement the Joint Statement. We \r\nhope that another agreement will be reached during the \r\nnew round of the Six-Party Talks now under way in \r\nBeijing, leading to the disabling of the nuclear \r\nfacilities of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. \r\n On the Korean peninsula, inter-Korean relations \r\nwill be taken to a higher level with the summit meeting \r\nto be held in Pyongyang next week between President \r\nRoh Moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong-il. The summit \r\nwill first of all aim at consolidating peace on the \r\nKorean peninsula. The Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea will be encouraged to move forward on the \r\npath to denuclearization. In the same vein, the leaders \r\nwill explore ways to increase mutual trust through \r\npolitical and military confidence-building measures, as \r\nwell as ways to lay the groundwork for an eventual \r\ninter-Korean economic community. With progress in \r\nthe denuclearization process, a new peace regime will \r\nbe established on the Korean peninsula to replace the \r\nhalf-century-old armistice. The deepening of inter-\r\nKorean relations and the improvement of ties between \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and other \r\ncountries concerned will warrant such a change.  \r\n The resolution of the nuclear issue of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will thus have \r\na ripple effect, extending its benefits well beyond the \r\nKorean peninsula. The denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula will strengthen the NPT regime, serving as a \r\nuseful example of a negotiated solution for similar \r\nproblems in other parts of the world, including those in \r\nthe Middle East. A peace process on the Korean \r\npeninsula will open the path to a regional security \r\ndialogue, and the resultant improvement in North-East \r\nAsian security will further strengthen regional and \r\nglobal cooperation for peace and prosperity.  \r\n That may be an optimistic view. But it is \r\nimportant that we see not only the threats and \r\nchallenges in our world but also the opportunities. With \r\nthe ongoing Six-Party Talks and next week’s inter-\r\nKorean summit, we see a real opportunity for change, \r\nand we hope that our partners in this process will help \r\nus to transform today’s uncertainty into tomorrow’s \r\nstability and prosperity. \r\n Our efforts in North-East Asia are a testament to \r\nthe importance of diplomacy and international \r\ncooperation, as exemplified by the United Nations. \r\nEven the most daunting challenges can be overcome \r\nwhen nations join forces to share the burden. For the \r\nRepublic of Korea, that is a lesson we have learned \r\nthrough hard experience. Ever mindful of the days \r\nwhen we gratefully received the assistance and support \r\nof the international community for our very survival, \r\nwe now try to help others, whether by working to \r\nstrengthen regional security, participating in \r\npeacekeeping missions far from home, or sharing our \r\nresources and knowledge. These will be our modest \r\ncontributions to the betterment of all humanity, the \r\nnoble purpose embodied in the United Nations. \r\n The President: I call on Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and External Trade of the Republic of Iceland. \r\n Mrs. Gísladóttir (Iceland): First, allow me to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. At \r\nthe same time, I should like to pay tribute to the work \r\nof your predecessor, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa. \r\n On this occasion I want to say how much my \r\ncountry has benefited from the existence of the United \r\nNations. The universal values enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter and the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights have given a context and perspective to \r\nour sovereignty and self-determination. Iceland’s story \r\nis testimony to the fact that it is through civilized \r\ncoexistence within the community of nations that \r\nsocieties prosper. Within living memory, Iceland \r\nprogressed from being one of the poorest countries in \r\nEurope to one of the most prosperous. We have had the \r\ngood fortune to be able to build a Nordic welfare \r\nsociety on the sustainable harvesting of our natural \r\nresources.  \r\n As a small, dynamic State without a military, it is \r\nour natural inclination to look for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes within the international \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n45 07-52121 \r\n \r\ncommunity. Our independence, which we achieved \r\nsome 60 years ago, is built on more than our \r\ndemocratic institutions, fundamentally important \r\nthough they are. Our freedom in the widest sense has \r\nbeen achieved through economic development as well \r\nas the guarantee of human rights and democracy.  \r\n In our experience, freedom is complex and \r\nmultifaceted. All human rights are universal, \r\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. But it is \r\nevident that poverty, inequality and the lack of \r\neconomic and social rights can make the exercise of \r\npolitical and civil rights difficult.  \r\n We are now about halfway to our deadline for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The year 2015 is \r\naround the corner and we will soon need to deliver on \r\nour promises. There has been some good news: it \r\nseems likely that the goal of halving the number of \r\npeople living in extreme poverty by 2015 will be \r\nreached. However, progress on many human \r\ndevelopment goals, such as on child mortality, has been \r\ndisappointing. Regional challenges remain, particularly \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It is incumbent \r\nupon those who have the good fortune to be prosperous \r\nto join in solidarity with others to make these rights \r\navailable to all. What is more, the security challenges \r\nthat we face this century are such that they can only be \r\naddressed together, in solidarity with others. Climate \r\nchange is a prime example. \r\n Indeed, the phenomenon of climate change is \r\nalready devastating the lives of millions across a broad \r\nswathe of Africa, among many small island States and \r\nwidely in Asia. Every region and most countries can \r\nexpect to feel the effects of climate change in the near \r\nfuture. How we address this issue as an international \r\ncommunity is a test of our commitment to the \r\nfundamental values of the United Nations and our \r\nability to act together in light of our shared \r\nresponsibility. The discussions that took place earlier \r\nthis week were an important step in identifying means \r\nand measures in this respect, and I thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his initiative. Although climate change is a \r\nglobal phenomenon, it tends to be the poorest in \r\ndeveloping countries that are hardest hit — those that \r\nare least responsible for causing climate change. \r\nClimate change is thus a severe threat to poverty \r\nreduction. \r\n It is important that the international community \r\ntreats adaptation to climate change not as a stand-alone \r\nissue but as an integral part of our common efforts to \r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. A \r\ncomprehensive approach is needed if we are to see \r\nresults. The Government of Iceland is committed to \r\nshowing solidarity with the most vulnerable in \r\nadapting to the effects of climate change. \r\n Iceland regards women’s empowerment and full \r\nparticipation at all levels as a fundamental issue for the \r\nnew millennium. Whether in relation to peace and \r\nsecurity, health, poverty or climate change, the \r\nempowerment of women is the key to success. Women \r\nand men need to be equally represented and listened to \r\neverywhere. I should like to reiterate Iceland’s support \r\nfor the recommendations of the High-level Panel on \r\nUnited Nations System-wide Coherence regarding \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment. The \r\ncurrent United Nations structure and approach to \r\ngender issues is too fragmented. The excellent work of \r\nthe United Nations Development Fund for Women \r\n(UNIFEM) must be built upon and reinforced within \r\nthe new structures. We firmly support the \r\nestablishment of a new gender entity to strengthen the \r\nperformance of the United Nations in this field of \r\nwork. Establishing the post of Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for gender equality issues should provide \r\nstrong leadership and coordination, and it is my hope \r\nthat this post will be quickly filled. Gender \r\nmainstreaming has to be addressed throughout the \r\nwhole United Nations system in a more systematic \r\nmanner. Let us use the current momentum to bring this \r\nprocess forward at this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Official development assistance (ODA) plays a \r\nvital role in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Let me state clearly that Iceland views these \r\nGoals as common goals. We see development as \r\nmutually beneficial co-operation. Freedom for Iceland \r\nhas been built through development and it is a vital \r\nelement of freedom for all peoples. Donors need to \r\ndeliver on their promises and accelerate their efforts in \r\nincreasing development assistance. The Government of \r\nIceland stands ready to shoulder its responsibility. Our \r\nODA has doubled over the past four years and we aim \r\nto be among the top ODA contributors. Increased aid \r\neffectiveness is central to development results. The \r\nGovernment of Iceland believes that the United \r\nNations should be at the forefront of such efforts. We \r\nsupport the follow-up of the report of the High-level \r\nPanel on System-wide Coherence (A/61/583), which in \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 46 \r\n \r\nour view will make the United Nations more effective \r\nin delivering results on the ground. \r\n ODA is of course not a panacea. We need to make \r\nprogress in international trade negotiations. When I \r\nhad the privilege of attending the meeting of the \r\nAfrican Union in Accra this summer, I was made aware \r\nby colleagues of the tremendous potential that African \r\ncountries see in closer integration across that continent. \r\nIn a globalized world closer regional cooperation and \r\nintegration, including trade relations, has, in our \r\nexperience, been a step towards a better future, a joint \r\ninvestment of nation States in their common well-\r\nbeing. \r\n Iceland pledges full political support to our \r\ncommon goal of halting global warming. Bearing in \r\nmind that there is now a window of opportunity, which \r\nmay close within a decade, the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendation on \r\nhalving emissions should be taken seriously. Iceland \r\nhas set itself a long-term aspirational goal of reducing \r\nnet greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 75 per cent by \r\n2050. The Kyoto Protocol provides a basis for effective \r\naction by developed nations, which must lead the way \r\nin controlling emissions. But Kyoto is not universal \r\nand it is not enough. Iceland believes that the Bali \r\nmeeting should start a process leading to a \r\ncomprehensive climate agreement, ideally to be \r\nconcluded in 2009, the year of the summit in \r\nCopenhagen. This agreement would cover the \r\npost-2012 period.  \r\n There is no “silver bullet” solution to the problem \r\nof global warming. The issue of deforestation, \r\nespecially the rain forests, must be addressed. The role \r\nof new technology is crucial, particularly in regard to \r\nalternative, sustainable and clean sources of energy. In \r\nthe field of geothermal energy, where Iceland has \r\nconsiderable experience, there is wide scope for \r\ndevelopment. New technology must not, however, \r\nexacerbate the very serious problems we already face. \r\nIt is, for example, a matter of grave concern that \r\nincreases in the production of biomass-based energy \r\nsources could be raising food prices. New sources of \r\nrenewable energy must also adhere strictly to long-\r\nterm environmental demands. This is particularly \r\nrelevant to the planned build-up of nuclear energy \r\nreactors. The creativity and research capabilities of \r\nuniversities, the commitment and inclusiveness of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the drive of business \r\nand industry must be activated in a broad and \r\nconsistent effort. Governments cannot do this alone. \r\n Iceland regards human security, as formulated for \r\nexample by the 2005 World Summit, to be of \r\nfundamental political and conceptual importance when \r\nit comes to discussing and deciding on action \r\nconcerning peace and security. A key instrument for \r\nensuring human security is Security Council resolution \r\n1325 (2000), which needs to be thoroughly \r\nimplemented. Millions of individuals experience \r\nassaults on their personal security. I am thinking of the \r\nbrutality inflicted by some Governments on their own \r\npeople and by terrorists or irregular forces on civilians.  \r\n In this context allow me to express deep concern \r\nover events in Myanmar where the democratically \r\nelected leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been held in \r\ndetention for years and where the peaceful expression \r\nof political dissent is at present being brutally \r\nrepressed.  \r\n I am thinking of the attacks on the providers of \r\nhumanitarian aid in many conflict regions. I am \r\nthinking of the failure of authorities around the world \r\nto ensure the protection of women and children from \r\nviolence and trafficking. In this context I should also \r\nlike to encourage other Member States to support the \r\ndraft resolution on a moratorium on the use of the \r\ndeath penalty. \r\n I wish to express appreciation for the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, the African \r\nUnion Commission Chairman, and the Security \r\nCouncil in finding a way forward towards alleviating \r\nthe suffering of the people of Darfur. There is however \r\nstill much to be done.  \r\n Crucial discussions are currently in progress to \r\nsolve the decades-long situation in the Middle East. It \r\nis clear to me that most people in Israel and Palestine \r\nyearn for peace. Indeed, opinion polls bear this out. In \r\nparticular, women from both sides voice their distress \r\nat the long-term effects of continued conflict on their \r\nchildren, who are the future of this region. The talks in \r\nprogress at the moment, with the support of the \r\nQuartet, the efforts of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, \r\nand, most important, the efforts of the Israeli and \r\nPalestinian Governments, give some hope. I encourage \r\npolitical leaders to ensure that the will for peace among \r\na great many people on both sides is reflected in the \r\npolitical process. This requires political courage and \r\ntrue leadership. It requires restraint when restraint is \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n47 07-52121 \r\n \r\nmost difficult. It requires a determination to outflank \r\nthe spoilers on both sides who wish to sacrifice the real \r\nprospects for a peaceful and fulfilling life for millions \r\nto the distant mirage of some unattainable utopia. Final \r\nstatus issues, which are critical to the Palestinians and \r\nthe Israelis, must be on the agenda for the peace \r\nconference that the President of the United States has \r\nproposed. The outcome must give both sides a clear \r\nview of a realistic and acceptable future for their \r\nchildren. Meanwhile, all who have it in their power, \r\nbear a responsibility to do their utmost to ensure the \r\nhumanitarian needs of the civilian population. \r\n Jordan and Syria, neighbouring States of Iraq, \r\nhave made generous provision for hundreds of \r\nthousands of refugees from Iraq. Iceland is determined \r\nto contribute to alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi \r\npeople and has pledged funds to the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for \r\nthe provision of schooling for Iraqi children in Jordan. \r\nWe also stand firmly behind United Nations-mandated \r\nefforts to assist in the stabilization and rebuilding of \r\nthe country.  \r\n Clearly a major threat to human security as well \r\nas State security is the proliferation of arms. Iceland \r\nregrets the current situation in the fields of arms \r\ncontrol, disarmament and non-proliferation. Despite \r\nsustained efforts by the majority of Member States \r\nover a number of years, only limited progress has been \r\nmade, some of it outside the United Nations \r\nframework. Our failures in this area pose a constant \r\nthreat to peace and security. Now is the time to renew \r\nour efforts. The conclusion of an arms trade treaty \r\nwould certainly be a significant achievement. A \r\nnumber of projects launched by the United Nations \r\nSummit of 2005 have made steady progress, including \r\nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council and of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. The 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) also gave the \r\nGeneral Assembly the task of reforming the Security \r\nCouncil. The momentum for completing this work \r\nmust be maintained so that the Security Council can be \r\nmore representative of our world at the beginning of \r\nthe twenty-first century. This would entail an increase \r\nin the number of elected and permanent seats.  \r\n Iceland has been an active and committed \r\nMember of the United Nations since 1946. In the light \r\nof the principle of rotation and the importance of all \r\nMember States sharing in the responsibility of serving \r\non the Security Council, we announced in 2000 our \r\nfirst-time candidacy for a seat for the period 2009-2010 \r\nwith elections to be held next autumn. This \r\ncandidature, which is actively supported by the other \r\nNordic States — Denmark, Finland, Norway and \r\nSweden — reflects Iceland’s firm commitment to play \r\nan active role in cooperation with others in addressing \r\nthe most pressing security threats of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. As a Nordic country we stand for a long \r\ntradition of active commitment to the United Nations \r\nand to the best interests of the whole. The Nordics have \r\na reputation for being bridge-builders — trusted \r\nmediators in complex situations. Iceland seeks to \r\nshoulder the responsibility to exercise with fairness \r\nand firmness the role of a Security Council member. \r\n The President: I now call on His Royal Highness \r\nPrince Mohamed Bolkiah, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Trade of Brunei Darussalam. \r\n Prince Bolkiah (Brunei Darussalam): May I offer \r\nmy congratulations to you, Mr. President, your \r\nGovernment and people on your election. I would also \r\nlike to offer my thanks to your predecessor, Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \r\nleadership of the General Assembly over the past year. \r\nI also offer my congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the progress he has made during the past \r\nnine months. His first report (A/62/1) is very \r\nencouraging, and we welcome his response to the new \r\nchallenges we are all facing. I also wish to thank our \r\nUnited Nations representatives, workers and volunteers \r\nthroughout the world who are undertaking very hard \r\ntasks which are often extremely dangerous. We thank \r\nthem for their professional dedication. This is \r\nespecially so in many parts of the Middle East. Here I \r\noffer once more our continued strong support for all \r\nthe efforts being made by the United Nations to find a \r\nsolution to the suffering of the Palestinian people. In \r\ndoing so we reaffirm our solidarity with the people of \r\nPalestine in their efforts to find a just and lasting \r\nsolution to problems that have been going on for \r\nalmost 60 years.  \r\n My last word of thanks, Mr. President, is to you \r\npersonally. We were most encouraged by your \r\nacceptance speech and your plan for the future. We \r\nwere pleased to hear you express strong support for \r\nmultilateral solutions to world problems. We certainly \r\nagree on the need for the United Nations to strengthen \r\nits central position in the multilateral system. Most of \r\nall, we are very happy with the idea of a lasting \r\nconsensus among Member States, the private sector, \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 48 \r\n \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society. We \r\nare especially pleased that civil societies were \r\nincluded. That means giving ordinary people a place in \r\nthe consensus. That is why we found the statement so \r\nencouraging. Nevertheless, it has set a very serious \r\nchallenge to the United Nations. It is most important \r\nthat our people gain the understanding that comes from \r\nknowledge, experience and expertise. Our theme of \r\nclimate change at this session shows this very clearly. \r\n The many discussions we have had this week \r\nhave taught us that all modern problems are extremely \r\ncomplicated. It has also shown us how important it is \r\nto gain a full understanding of these difficulties. If our \r\npeople are to gain such understanding, it will come \r\nfrom having universal good education, good health and \r\nstrong social services. This will come only when all \r\ncountries have reached the United Nations Millennium \r\nGoals. So it is more urgent than ever that these Goals \r\nbe reached on time. They cover all aspects of modern \r\nlife — political, social, cultural, and, perhaps above all \r\ntoday, economic and commercial. As such they provide \r\na way for people to understand modern problems well, \r\ntake a full part in the consensus and help to find a \r\nsolution.  \r\n I say this because we are now at the critical \r\nhalfway point that we set seven years ago in planning \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The discussion we \r\nhave had all week on climate change shows how vital \r\nthe next seven years will be. In my own country we \r\nhave only just started to realize how difficult the \r\nsubject is. It is like security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment and energy. These are all new, \r\ntwenty-first century problems, and they all mean that \r\nour people need to learn more and more and to learn \r\nvery quickly. \r\n We need to include the subject I have mentioned \r\nin all aspects of national development planning, and we \r\nneed to share knowledge and expertise. We believe that \r\nthis is more important than ever. This is because by \r\nexchanging views and information on climate change \r\nthis week we have also learned another new lesson, \r\nwhich teaches us that when it comes to modern twenty-\r\nfirst century problems we are all in them together. That \r\nis what your consensus, Mr. President, means. It \r\nrecognizes that we all have an important contribution \r\nto make — if we work together. That is why we very \r\nmuch value the partnership you have proposed. We \r\nhope it will result in our people becoming far more \r\nthan just receivers of solutions. We hope it will start to \r\nmake them one of the most important agents in finding \r\nsolutions. \r\n We feel you have begun your term of office, \r\nMr. President, by inviting us all to share a modern \r\nplatform on which we can all work well. We are very \r\npleased to join you and your consensus for the sixty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly, and we wish \r\nyou much success in broadening and strengthening it \r\nduring the coming year. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Moussa Okanla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, African Integration, La Francophonie and \r\nBeninese Living Abroad of the Republic of Benin. \r\n Mr. Okanla (Benin) (spoke in French): \r\nMr. President, at the outset I should like to offer you \r\nmy sincere congratulations on your brilliant election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. I assure you of my delegation’s full \r\ncooperation. It will spare no effort to contribute to the \r\nsuccess of the deliberations of this session, at your \r\nside, of course, because Benin is one of the Vice-\r\nPresidents. \r\n I also pay tribute to the excellent job done by \r\nyour predecessor, Her Excellency Mrs. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa. Throughout her term she was able to give \r\nnew momentum to the General Assembly by \r\nrelaunching the dialogue on the implementation of the \r\nglobal partnership for development. Under her clear \r\ndirection our delegations were able to thoroughly study \r\nthe many questions that have been pending within the \r\nframework of the implementation of the conclusions of \r\nthe 2005 Summit, and they have been able to assess the \r\nchallenges to be met.  \r\n We also express appreciation to the new United \r\nNations Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon. He has been able to follow in the footsteps of \r\nhis illustrious predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan, by \r\nmaintaining the pace of his reforms. Mr. Ban has not \r\nonly maintained the momentum of the reforms but has \r\nalso given them a visible personal mark that denotes a \r\nwill to streamline in an innovative and consensual way \r\nthe use of resources available for concrete action in \r\nkeeping with the perils that confront us.  \r\n We support the United Nations, which must assert \r\nitself as an effective organization, capable of serving as \r\na melting pot for multilateral, inclusive, productive and \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n49 07-52121 \r\n \r\nconclusive cooperation in the search for appropriate \r\nsolutions to the many challenges of our time. \r\n These challenges include ongoing conflicts, the \r\nrise of extremism, the weakening and destabilization of \r\nentire regions, the continued impoverishment of the \r\nmost vulnerable populations and the practice of trade \r\nsubsidies and protectionism in developed countries. \r\nThey deny us our comparative advantages and stifle \r\nour producers by distorting the international market. It \r\nis necessary and urgent to establish a safety net so that \r\nAfrican countries affected by subsidies can compensate \r\nfor the enormous losses that they suffer. In addition, \r\nsocial inequalities between States and within our \r\nsocieties are ever greater. The proliferation of endemic \r\ndiseases decimates human resources. Malnutrition, \r\ndesertification and coastal erosion dangerously reduce \r\nvital space and accentuate competition for survival, \r\ntogether with repeated flooding resulting from global \r\nwarming linked to climate change. \r\n We have indeed made considerable progress since \r\nthe Rio Summit in terms of the implementation of \r\ninstruments for global governance in the area of the \r\nenvironment. Given the warnings and many alarms that \r\nscientists have sent us in recent years we now need to \r\naccelerate their comprehensive implementation, \r\nbecause they give clear guidance to the efforts \r\nundertaken by men to restore control over phenomena \r\nand changes that jeopardize the conditions of our \r\nexistence on Earth. It is urgent to maximize synergies \r\nwithin the framework of the implementation of these \r\ninstruments to ensure greater effectiveness. That is one \r\nof the urgent tasks to be put on the agenda of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change scheduled \r\nfor December 2007 in Bali, Indonesia. \r\n The risks stemming from climate change are \r\nterrifying, particularly for low-income coastal \r\ncountries such as Benin. They dictate that we act in \r\nadvance instead of in response because we need to deal \r\nwith well-established contingencies via a precautionary \r\napproach and by consistent implementation of the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility. \r\nBeyond the vast investments required to deal with \r\ncoastal erosion and the deterioration of lands, the \r\neradication of poverty and improving the living \r\nconditions of the poorest sections of the population are \r\nessential aspects of efforts undertaken to strengthen the \r\nresistance of our societies to the negative impacts of \r\nclimate change.  \r\n Above all we must increase our efforts to \r\ntransform our patterns of consumption and global \r\nenergy policies by using renewable energy sources. By \r\nway of example, switching from firewood to solar \r\nstoves would save many hectares of forests that are \r\nannually decimated by the poorest populations to \r\nensure their energy supplies. It has been established \r\nthat the manner in which the world’s energy needs, \r\nparticularly those of developing countries, will be \r\ncovered in the decades to come will be key to our \r\nability to address climate change. We need to carry out \r\na change of mindset to bring about a change in \r\nbehaviour. To do this, the question of financing needs \r\nto be resolved in a clearly understood spirit of \r\ninternational solidarity and interdependence. \r\n The international community will need to deliver \r\non the pledges made in Monterrey and Gleneagles by \r\nmobilizing the funds to ensure implementation of the \r\nnational programmes of action and adaptation and the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nIt is fortunate that the high-level dialogue to be held in \r\nNew York on 23 and 24 October 2007 and the meeting \r\nto be held in Qatar in 2008 will give us an opportunity \r\nto bring about a thorough evaluation of the situation in \r\norder to seek the optimum solutions to the problems \r\nbefore us.  \r\n Assessing performance in the area of financing \r\nfor development is how we should measure the \r\neffectiveness of international financial institutions. Our \r\nhope is that appropriate reforms will be undertaken so \r\nthat they will be able to fully shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities in terms of mobilizing resources for \r\npoor countries so that they can make up the lag. \r\n Special attention needs to be given also to \r\ninternal constraints related to governance and to the \r\nmeagre mobilization of local resources that curb \r\neconomic and social development. The Government of \r\nBenin, for example, has intensified its efforts to root \r\nout corruption and promote transparent and effective \r\nmanagement of public finances. Our efforts in these \r\nareas are coupled with measures to facilitate \r\ninvestment, including the establishment of a \r\npresidential investment council and the proclamation \r\nof free nursery and primary schooling, measures that \r\nhave been judged to be essential for the continued \r\nstrengthening of democracy, economic growth and \r\nsocial progress. The assistance from the international \r\ncommunity is greatly appreciated and is now being \r\ndirected exclusively to the goals agreed upon. In this \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 50 \r\n \r\nregard, Benin has joined the peer review mechanism \r\ninstituted by the African Union within the framework \r\nof the promotion of good governance and \r\npeacebuilding continent-wide. \r\n Our search for solutions to the new threats can \r\nonly progress if we are able to preserve international \r\npeace and security. It is disappointing that our efforts \r\nsince the 2005 Summit to reform the body which has \r\nthe primary responsibility for this, have been less than \r\nconclusive. We need to rekindle our fervour in order to \r\ngive the Organization a Security Council that is more \r\nrepresentative in terms of its membership and more \r\ntransparent and effective in its working methods. \r\nWhatever the formula decided upon, reform of the \r\nSecurity Council cannot be viable if it does not take \r\ninto account the realities of today’s world, which differ \r\ngreatly from those of the 1940s. It cannot be fair if it \r\ndoes not rationally rectify the boundless harm done to \r\nAfrica by excluding it from the category of permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council. \r\n Reform of the Council will undoubtedly reflect \r\non its authority and its ability to fulfil its mandate in a \r\nsatisfactory manner with respect to the situations \r\nconcerning the fundamental principles of the Charter, \r\nsuch as the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which \r\nis more than 50 years old now. That conflict continues \r\nto destabilize the Middle East, and it cannot be \r\notherwise so long as the vision of two sovereign, \r\ncontiguous States has not been implemented and the \r\noccupied territories, including the Golan Heights and \r\nthe Shaba’a farmlands, have not been returned. \r\n We are also concerned by the continued arms race \r\nand the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nas well as the stalemate in the multilateral negotiations. \r\nWe need to stem the illicit trafficking in small arms and \r\nlight weapons by adopting and implementing a treaty \r\non arms trafficking. The proliferation of non-State \r\narmed groups, widespread violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law and war crimes against civilian \r\npopulations, particularly against women and children \r\nin situations of conflict, must continue to be given our \r\nunswerving attention. The perpetrators of these crimes \r\nneed to be tried by the International Criminal Court, \r\nwhose role as a deterrent needs to be enhanced by \r\ngreater cooperation with the Security Council and the \r\nauthority to initiate proceedings itself. We welcome the \r\nfact that great progress has been made in the \r\ndeployment of a United Nations mechanism for \r\nmonitoring and outreach on the recruitment and use of \r\nchildren in armed conflicts and on the possibility of it \r\nbeing extended. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union within the framework of the \r\nimplementation of the Union’s 10-year plan of support \r\nfor capacity-building needs to be continued in \r\naccordance with the spirit of Chapter VIII of the \r\nCharter. Management of the situation in Darfur has \r\ngiven us a field for experimentation that will enable us \r\nto draw lessons to strengthen the effectiveness of this \r\ncooperation beyond the constraints and handicaps by \r\nlooking at optimal solutions. We welcome the \r\nestablishment of the hybrid force. Our hope is that its \r\nnumerical and logistical capacities will enable it to \r\ndeal with the crisis. We hope that similar efforts will be \r\nundertaken for Somalia. \r\n The promotion of human dignity is necessary to \r\nbe able continually to strengthen international peace \r\nand security. It is at the heart of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, proclaimed on \r\n10 December 1948. We commemorate its sixtieth \r\nanniversary next year. This is an opportunity to \r\nundertake singular and proactive action to disseminate \r\nhuman rights for rural and peri-urban populations and \r\ncommunities, which are for the most part illiterate. \r\nThese social strata have been cut off from the benefits \r\nof human rights but would be empowered and would \r\nbecome responsible for their own fulfilment if given \r\naccess to human rights.  \r\n My country, which is firmly committed to \r\ndemocracy, here reiterates its unswerving commitment \r\nto make an effective contribution commensurate with \r\nits means to the protection and promotion of human \r\ndignity. That is the aim of my country’s proposal for a \r\nnew agenda item at the current session of the General \r\nAssembly with the consensus title of “Celebration of \r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights”. A draft resolution will be submitted \r\nand negotiated under this item. It could also serve as \r\nthe framework for the proclamation of an international \r\nyear for the promotion, dissemination and \r\nappropriation of human rights. \r\n In that connection, my country, together with the \r\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF) and all \r\ninterested parties, proposes to organize an international \r\nconference in 2008 on the challenges and issues \r\ninvolved in democratic changes of government. I urge \r\nall United Nations Member States to support these \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n51 07-52121 \r\n \r\ninitiatives so that they will come to pass for the \r\nbetterment of our peoples. \r\n The President: I call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Adrian Mihai Cioroianu, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Romania. \r\n Mr. Cioroianu (Romania): Allow me to begin by \r\nexpressing my sincere appreciation and congratulations \r\nto you, Mr. President, upon your election to the \r\npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session and to wish you full success in \r\nthis challenging endeavour. At the same time, I should \r\nlike to extend my appreciation to Her Excellency \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her excellent \r\nwork as President at the sixty-first session. Romania \r\nfully subscribes to the statement delivered by His \r\nExcellency José Socrates, the Prime Minister of \r\nPortugal, on behalf of the European Union. I would \r\nalso like to add some reflections on the interests of my \r\ncountry. Romania remains firmly attached to its \r\nengagement in favour of efficient multilateralism on all \r\nthree pillars of United Nations activity — peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and sustainable development. \r\n Romania wishes to be an active participant in all \r\nongoing reform processes according to the guidelines \r\nwe accepted in the Millennium Summit Outcome. It \r\nseems there is a quasi-consensus on the principle of the \r\nenlargement of the Security Council but not yet on the \r\npractical ways in which this could take place. We all \r\nknow that this is because the structural reform of a \r\nprincipal organ has profound political implications. It \r\nseems also that there is little disagreement on the \r\ngeneral principle that the Security Council should \r\nreflect the geopolitical configuration of the present-day \r\nworld. We believe that the comprehensive solution \r\noffered by an intermediary stage should be regarded \r\npositively, precisely because at this stage it is general \r\nenough to allow everybody to see that the new \r\nconfiguration would come closer to one’s aim. Let us \r\nsee if it stands the test of substantive negotiations. \r\nNevertheless, negotiations on the enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council should not prevent progress and \r\ndecisions being made on other dimensions, namely, \r\nimproving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil, particularly on the issue of the transparency \r\nof Security Council activity and the possibility of \r\nlimiting veto use. Finally, with 23 members the Eastern \r\nEuropean Group should be entitled to at least one \r\nadditional seat in the Security Council in any formula \r\nto be agreed upon. It should also be re-emphasized \r\nthat, despite being the most dynamically growing \r\nregional group within the United Nations General \r\nAssembly, the Eastern European presence in \r\nmanagerial positions in the United Nations Secretariat \r\nand in United Nations bodies is still minimal. \r\n Romania follows with particular attention the \r\nlatest developments in Kosovo. The solution for the \r\nstatus of the province of Kosovo needs to be in line \r\nwith the international law in force. We welcome the \r\nefforts of the Troika to facilitate the negotiations \r\nbetween the two parties. The direct talks that were held \r\ntoday here in New York represent a positive evolution, \r\nand similar meetings should be organized in the \r\nmonths to come. Direct negotiations between Belgrade \r\nand Pristina will contribute to reaching a genuine \r\ncompromise that will support the stability of the \r\nWestern Balkans and the European perspective of this \r\nregion. \r\n(continued in French) \r\n In Iraq positive developments in the area of \r\ninstitution building, interfaith reconciliation and \r\nsecurity must be consolidated through regional and \r\ninternational support. The new Security Council \r\nresolution 1770 (2007) represents a broad United \r\nNations mandate to provide assistance for development \r\nand reconstruction and mediation for political dialogue \r\nat the national and regional levels. We welcome the \r\nministerial meeting on Iraq on 22 September last, \r\nchaired by the Prime Minister of Iraq and the United \r\nNations Secretary-General. We believe that the efforts \r\nof the international community with regard to Iraq will \r\nbear fruit. Romania is present on the ground and stands \r\nwith the people and Government of Iraq. \r\n Preventing and combating terrorism require \r\neffective multilateralism, based on the norms of \r\ninternational law. We must meet the threat of \r\ninternational terrorism with concerted action. Global \r\naction against terrorism requires measures to disrupt \r\ngroups involved in terrorist activities through \r\ninternational cooperation. Our efforts to combat \r\nterrorism must be unrelenting but they must respect \r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms. Combating \r\nterrorism must also take account of the social and \r\neconomic roots of terrorism. No country can ensure its \r\nsecurity alone. Romania supports efforts undertaken by \r\ninternational, regional and subregional organizations to \r\nbuild up international solidarity against terrorism in \r\naccordance with international law, and it cooperates \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 52 \r\n \r\nbilaterally with other countries to prevent and combat \r\nthis scourge. \r\n The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains the \r\npillar for the international legal system in the area of \r\nnuclear non-proliferation. It is also an essential \r\ninstrument for promoting international peace and \r\nsecurity. Despite all the difficulties in recent years, the \r\nNPT is still relevant and significant. The balance \r\nbetween rights and duties enshrined in the Treaty is \r\nessential for the stability of the international system. \r\nThe maintenance of the fundamental principles of the \r\nTreaty on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and \r\ninternational cooperation, as well as guarantees to \r\nobserve non-proliferation requirements, are essential.  \r\n Romania places a great deal of importance on \r\ndeveloping nuclear energy and promoting its peaceful \r\nuse in areas such as medicine, industry, agriculture and \r\nin other areas of public usefulness. Romania also \r\nagrees with the idea that adopting nuclear energy as an \r\necologically sound alternative source of energy in the \r\ncontext of implementing the Kyoto Protocol is an \r\nimportant choice. \r\n The international community must give priority \r\nattention to the threat of the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction and access by terrorists to these \r\ntypes of weapons. My country does not neglect \r\nproblems related to conventional weapons and firmly \r\nsupports the need to start structured consideration of \r\nthe question of a future international legal instrument \r\non the weapons trade.  \r\n Romania is participating actively in peacekeeping \r\noperations by providing military observers, staff \r\nofficers, guards and police officers to 10 peacekeeping \r\noperations in four continents — Haiti, Congo, Ethiopia \r\nand Eritrea, Sudan, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, Nepal, \r\nTimor-Leste, Georgia and Kosovo. Romania is also \r\nparticipating in peace operations in the Western \r\nBalkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.  \r\n The Blue Helmets deserve the gratitude of host \r\ncountries and of the international community. We \r\nbelieve that in setting up multinational forces under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations we should take account \r\nof the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the \r\ncountry where the Blue Helmets are deployed. \r\n Romania, now a member of the European Union, \r\nevolved under the political idea that democracy, human \r\nrights and the rule of law are essential for the \r\ndevelopment of our societies. That is why we would \r\nlike to commit to supporting, in an imaginative \r\nfashion, human rights, democracy, tolerance and \r\ndiplomacy as a means for settling all disputes, as well \r\nas dialogue between cultures and civilizations. It is \r\nworthwhile recalling that Bucharest hosted the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) High-Level Conference on Combating \r\nDiscrimination and Promoting Mutual Respect and \r\nUnderstanding in June 2007. That Conference was an \r\nopportunity to highlight the need to react at the \r\npolitical and institutional levels to combat all forms of \r\nintolerance and discrimination in order to guarantee \r\nrespect for human rights and to ensure that every \r\ncitizen feels protected by the law and has concrete \r\nproof of the solidarity of others when his or her rights \r\nare flouted.  \r\n I believe that the international community needs \r\nto give deeper consideration to some sensitive issues in \r\norder to adopt appropriate measures. I am thinking \r\nabout the need to ensure that the rights of children are \r\nprotected, and that is why Romania supports the \r\nestablishment of the post of Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General to combat violence against \r\nchildren. \r\n My Government pays particular attention to \r\naction taken by the Human Rights Council, especially \r\nsince from last June to mid-2008 the chairmanship of \r\nthis new institution is held by Romania. The \r\ninstitutional structure of this organization is almost \r\ncomplete. What we have achieved is a compromise. \r\nThe new Council is not the irreproachable body that we \r\nhad imagined, but it needs to be used, because \r\npromotion of respect for human rights is a battle we \r\nmust wage relentlessly. The General Assembly’s \r\napproval of the report of the Human Rights Council, \r\nwhich also includes the institutional package adopted \r\nhalfway through this year, will certainly help us meet \r\nthis goal. This new institution must put to greater use \r\nits calling, which is to increase awareness of and \r\nrespect for human rights and to strengthen those rights \r\nworldwide. It must also ensure that States honour their \r\ncommitments. Romania reiterates its confidence in the \r\ncapacity of the Human Rights Council to become a \r\nsound and credible example in the institutional system \r\ndevoted to protecting human rights. \r\n Democracy is a global process. Twenty-five years \r\nago, less than one third of the States worldwide could \r\nbe deemed to be true democracies. Now that \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n53 07-52121 \r\n \r\npercentage has increased considerably and represents \r\nthe standard. We believe that progress in the principles \r\nof democracy and human rights in political decisions \r\nrepresents a victory for us all. With the common efforts \r\nof member States, a considerable number of resolutions \r\nand declarations on various aspects related to \r\ndemocracy have been adopted. For example, in 2000 \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution \r\n2000/47, “Promoting and consolidating democracy”, \r\nintroduced by my country.  \r\n The resolution brought together, for the first time \r\nin a single coherent document, the principles, values \r\nand practices that represent a framework for actions \r\ntaken by governments to promote democracy.  \r\n Of course there are close ties between democracy \r\nand respecting human rights. That is the primary \r\nmessage that Romania and other sponsors wanted to \r\ntransmit through resolutions on pursuing dialogue on \r\nmeasures to promote and consolidate democracy, \r\ndemocracy and human rights, and reinforcing the role \r\nof regional, subregional and other mechanisms and \r\norganizations to promote and consolidate democracy. \r\nAll those resolutions were adopted. \r\n We are also very pleased to see that the \r\nCommunity of Democracies has now become an active \r\ngroup committed to promoting the values and standards \r\nof democracy. We are prepared to work with other \r\ndelegations that are members of the working group in \r\nthe Community of Democracies. Romania recently \r\ntook on the task of coordinating the group in \r\nanticipation of the next ministerial conference, to be \r\nheld in Bamako. \r\n As a Member of the United Nations that benefits \r\nfrom constant and sound economic growth, Romania \r\nwill join the group of donor countries by the end of this \r\nyear. Official development assistance designed as a \r\ngradual and progressive commitment will now be a key \r\npart of our foreign policy and an expression of our \r\ninternational solidarity with countries in transition or \r\ndeveloping countries. We already have a national \r\nstrategy, an institutional structure and a budget with a \r\nline item for official development assistance. Above \r\nall, we have unswerving political commitment. We will \r\nlook closely at all options for providing voluntary \r\ncontributions through the United Nations system in \r\nsetting our initial priorities. \r\n On climate change, the United Nations clearly \r\nhas a key role to play in assisting regions devastated by \r\nnatural catastrophes. We are fully aware of the \r\nstaggering impact of climate change on human beings. \r\nLet us recall the words of Immanuel Kant, who said \r\nthat “Two things fill the mind with ever new and \r\nincreasing admiration and awe: the starry heavens \r\nabove me and the moral law within me”. Let moral law \r\nand reason prevail so that we can preserve the starry \r\nsky. It is likely that the general degree of freedom has \r\nnever attained such a high level in the history of \r\nmankind as it has in our day. If we are freer, more \r\ninformed and more aware than our forefathers, we also \r\nhave a greater responsibility to care for our \r\nenvironment. This year, Romania, like other countries, \r\nhas suffered the consequences of climate change — \r\nextremely hot temperatures and drought followed by \r\ntorrential rains and flooding. Political leaders must \r\nsupport the formulation of a new legal instrument. \r\nThey must support scientific research in order to \r\nreduce the world economy’s dependence on fossil fuels \r\nand to stimulate the discovery of new technologies.  \r\n In 1990, Romania began political and economic \r\naction towards sustainable development and a \r\nsustainable economy. Thus, in 1994 Romania ratified \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and in 2001 the Kyoto Protocol. Given these \r\nalmost unprecedented phenomena, we need to \r\nconsolidate regional and European capacity to act. To \r\nthat end, the relevant Romanian institutions have \r\nconsidered holding a high-level regional meeting to \r\ndiscuss policies in response to global warming, in \r\nparticular action and support mechanisms with regard \r\nto problems related to drought. This initiative will be \r\nconcentrated on Central Europe and South-East \r\nEurope. \r\n Romania places particular importance to the \r\ndialogue among cultures and religions. We believe this \r\nhas become essential for meeting today’s global \r\nchallenges. My country is rich in cultural diversity. It \r\nlies at the crossroads of cultures and civilizations and \r\nis fully engaged in international and regional initiatives \r\nto promote intercultural and interfaith dialogue. The \r\nthird European Ecumenical Assembly, which was held \r\nat the beginning of September at Sibiu, Romania — the \r\nEuropean Capital of Culture for 2007 — is a clear \r\nrecent example of our culture of dialogue. \r\n Today’s world is constantly changing and \r\nrequires increased cooperation within the international \r\ncommunity. That is why we welcome the joint \r\nactivities of the United Nations and the International \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 54 \r\n \r\nOrganization of La Francophonie (OIF). From 25 to \r\n29 September 2006, that forum met in Bucharest, \r\nRomania. As host country for the eleventh Summit, our \r\ncountry chaired the Conference of Heads of \r\nFrancophone State or Government, as well as the \r\nMinisterial Conference of La Francophonie. In playing \r\nthis double role we felt it our duty to be very actively \r\ninvolved not only in institutional reform but also in \r\nfurthering cooperation among French speakers. \r\n Despite criticism, deserved or not, the United \r\nNations is still a necessary organization without which \r\nthe international community would lose its way. \r\nEconomic globalization and the information society are \r\nstrengthening, not weakening, the universal calling, the \r\nlegitimacy and the moral authority of this \r\nOrganization. But it is up to us, the Member States, to \r\nserve the Organization beyond our narrow or fleeting \r\ninterests. \r\n The President: I call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Masahiko Koumura, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Japan. \r\n Mr. Koumura (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): First, let me \r\njoin other speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-second session. I should also like to pay \r\nhigh tribute to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa for her leadership during the previous \r\nsession. My great appreciation goes as well to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication and \r\ninitiative in addressing the many challenges \r\nconfronting the United Nations.  \r\n In the face of new challenges, the United Nations \r\nneeds to transform itself from forum to actor. The \r\ndemands of the twenty-first century call for the \r\ncreation of a United Nations that is proactive. I \r\ncommend the Secretary-General’s determination to \r\nbring about this change. It is no coincidence that, given \r\nthe current international environment, Japan also has \r\nembarked on a proactive foreign policy. With our \r\napproaches thus in harmony, Japan and the United \r\nNations can and must work together. In my remarks \r\nthis evening I will emphasize two areas in which the \r\ncooperation between the two actors may be optimized: \r\nclimate change and African development. I will also \r\ntouch on the need for United Nations reform, notably \r\nthe reform of the Security Council, so that the United \r\nNations may address those missions effectively. \r\n In the era of globalization, the international \r\ncommunity has come to face new challenges that reach \r\nacross borders. In particular, climate change will be a \r\ncrisis for all humanity, not only the people of today but \r\nalso the generations of the future. Now is the time for \r\nall of us to take action for future generations, giving \r\nspecial consideration to vulnerable countries. Let us \r\nleave behind discord and division among nations and \r\nshift gears to combine our efforts in order to face this \r\ncommon challenge. The Intergovernmental Panel on \r\nClimate Change (IPCC) has indicated that the fact of \r\nglobal warming is unequivocal, so world leaders have \r\nthe responsibility to make bold new political decisions \r\nto address this growing challenge. With such \r\nresponsibility in mind, Japan presented a new proposal \r\non climate change in May and has proposed that we \r\ncollectively embrace a long-term vision for developing \r\ninnovative technologies and building a low-carbon \r\nsociety. Japan has also called for a mid-term strategy \r\nfor a new framework that includes all major emitters of \r\ngreenhouse gases.  \r\n We need to tackle climate change without pause \r\nup to and beyond 2012. In this regard, I highly \r\ncommend the political commitment expressed by world \r\nleaders at the high-level event held on 24 September \r\nunder the initiative of the Secretary-General. Japan for \r\nits part will contribute to the negotiations for an \r\ninternational agreement through the Group of Eight \r\n(G-8) Hokkaido-Toyako Summit to be held next year, \r\nand will feed the results back into the United Nations \r\nprocess. \r\n Japan has gained in international competitiveness \r\nby improving energy efficiency and decreasing oil \r\nconsumption during a period in which its gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) doubled. We are ready to \r\nshare our technologies and experience, which hold the \r\nkey to achieving environmental preservation, energy \r\nsecurity and economic growth in tandem. At the same \r\ntime, each and every one of us needs to move forward \r\nfrom mere ideas and reconfigure our own way of life. \r\nJapan is promoting a new national campaign aimed at \r\nreducing the carbon dioxide emissions of individual \r\nhouseholds, in addition to the introduction of the Cool \r\nBiz — casual dress code — initiative. The spirit of \r\nmottainai — rejecting wastefulness — and the Three \r\nRs initiative to reduce, reuse and recycle waste also \r\ncontribute to this aim. It is my intention to globally \r\nbroaden the campaign to restructure our lifestyles. To \r\nthat end, my Government values exchanges with \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n55 07-52121 \r\n \r\ncorporations, academics, non-governmental \r\norganizations and various other actors in public \r\nforums, while at the same time cooperating with the \r\nUnited Nations Global Compact. \r\n Another priority area for Japan is African \r\ndevelopment. Africa as a whole is now undergoing \r\npositive change. Peace is being consolidated in several \r\nformer conflict areas. Meanwhile, many countries, both \r\nwith and without natural resources, are growing \r\nrobustly.  \r\n For Africa to become a more vibrant continent, a \r\ncontinent of greater hope and opportunity, three things \r\nare particularly important in addition to the prevention \r\nand resolution of conflicts. First and foremost, \r\neconomic growth must be enhanced and sustained. \r\nSecondly, human security needs to be ensured through \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), the consolidation of peace and the \r\nestablishment of democratic governance. Finally, the \r\nissues of the environment and climate change must be \r\naddressed.  \r\n Japan will host the fourth Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development (TICAD IV) in \r\nYokohama in May 2008. TICAD, whose first meeting \r\nwas held in 1993, is a process open to all. The TICAD \r\nprocess places particular importance on African \r\nownership and true partnership with the international \r\ncommunity. The three areas that I have just mentioned \r\nwill be the focus of the discussion at TICAD IV, which \r\nwill be a fresh opportunity to mobilize the knowledge \r\nand resources of the international community for \r\nAfrican development. South-South cooperation \r\nbetween Asia and Africa will remain a key feature in \r\nthe TICAD process.  \r\n Without peace in Africa, the world at large will \r\nnot enjoy peace and prosperity. Japan cannot ignore the \r\nsituation in Darfur. Faced with the world’s worst \r\nhumanitarian crisis, Japan has provided assistance \r\namounting to approximately $85 million. Japan also \r\nwelcomes the establishment of the African Union-\r\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and looks \r\nforward to its early deployment as well as to steady \r\nprogress in the political process in Darfur. Japan \r\nintends to further enhance its contribution for the \r\nconsolidation of peace and stability in Africa. \r\n Peace paves the way for development and human \r\nsecurity. However, achieving peace is not an easy task. \r\nIraq, for example, is struggling to achieve security and \r\nreconciliation, and the foundation for peace remains \r\nweak. Japan has been assisting the reconstruction \r\nefforts of the Iraqi people by measures such as \r\ndispatching its Self-Defence Forces and providing \r\nofficial development assistance of up to $5 billion.  \r\n To help in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, \r\nJapan has played a leading role in the field of \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration and the \r\ndisbandment of illegal armed groups, working in close \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan. Japan hosted the Conference \r\non Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups in Tokyo in \r\nJune this year to contribute to the rebuilding of \r\nAfghanistan through joint efforts with the United \r\nNations. \r\n To build peace, it is essential for the international \r\ncommunity to ensure a seamless and comprehensive \r\neffort to fulfil tasks ranging from resolving conflicts to \r\nassisting reconstruction. As current Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, Japan is resolved to make \r\na significant contribution to such international efforts. \r\nOne concrete measure that has been taken is the launch \r\nof the Hiroshima Peacebuilders Centre to train civilian \r\nexperts in Asia to better respond to various needs on \r\nthe ground.  \r\n Free and fair elections and democracy are also \r\nessential for the consolidation of peace. Japan spares \r\nno effort to provide assistance in order to promote \r\ndemocratization. Japan has dispatched election \r\nobserver missions to a number of countries, including \r\nTimor-Leste and Sierra Leone. Japan has also provided \r\nelection-related support and dispatched arms monitors \r\nto Nepal.  \r\n It is extremely regrettable that the crackdown on \r\nthe demonstrations in Myanmar has caused casualties, \r\nincluding the death of a Japanese citizen. Japan calls \r\non the Government of Myanmar to exercise utmost \r\nrestraint and to refrain from the use of oppressive \r\nforce. Japan demands that the Government of Myanmar \r\nmake every effort to resolve the situation through \r\ndialogue. \r\n Along with democracy, the rule of law helps to \r\nlay the groundwork for peace and prosperity. To \r\npromote the rule of law in the international community, \r\nJapan will accede to the Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court next month, and is helping to improve \r\nlegal systems in developing countries. In February, in \r\norder to give proactive support to the norm-setting role \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 56 \r\n \r\nof the United Nations, Japan signed the International \r\nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance and today I have signed the \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \r\n Behind those endeavours lies the conviction that \r\nthe international community must cooperate in \r\naddressing international challenges based on such \r\nfundamental principles as freedom, human rights, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. The primary pillar of \r\nsuch fundamental values is respect for human dignity. \r\nThe issue of abductions by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea poses a serious challenge to human \r\ndignity. It is essential that the international community \r\nsend a strong message calling for the earliest resolution \r\nof the abduction issue so that the victims and their \r\nfamilies may be reunited and have an opportunity to \r\nrecapture their former happiness. Japan will continue \r\nto work towards the resolution of this issue as well as \r\nthe settlement of the issues of the unfortunate past \r\nthrough dialogue in accordance with the Pyongyang \r\nDeclaration. With hope for an improvement of the \r\nhuman rights situation, Japan will also pursue the \r\nadoption of a draft resolution on the situation of human \r\nrights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at \r\nthis session of the General Assembly. \r\n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand their means of delivery is another challenge that \r\nrequires the undivided attention of humankind. From \r\nthat point of view I welcome the Security Council’s \r\nadoption by consensus of a series of resolutions on the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran. It is \r\nnow up to all of us to translate the will of the \r\ninternational community into concrete action through \r\nfull implementation of the relevant resolutions. Japan \r\nwill continue its efforts to achieve the denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula through the Six-Party Talks. \r\nJapan will also continue to urge Iran to heed the \r\nunanimous voice of the international community and \r\nsuspend its enrichment-related activities.  \r\n Nuclear disarmament should receive no less \r\nattention. I reiterate here the determination of my \r\ncountry to reinforce international efforts for nuclear \r\ndisarmament, as the only country in the world that has \r\nsuffered nuclear devastation. Japan will again submit a \r\ndraft resolution at this session of the General Assembly \r\nto map out concrete measures towards the total \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. \r\n The issue of terrorism also requires sustained \r\nefforts as it becomes increasingly complex. In that \r\nregard, Japan welcomes the adoption of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1776 (2007). For our own part, we \r\nwill make efforts to continue our refuelling activities in \r\nthe Indian Ocean to fulfil our role as a responsible \r\nmember of the international community. Japan also \r\nsupports the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy (resolution 60/288). Furthermore, to \r\nstrengthen the legal counter-terrorism framework I call \r\nupon every State to exercise the utmost flexibility for \r\nan early conclusion of the negotiations on a draft \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\n In the face of a variety of threats to international \r\npeace and security, the Security Council has come to \r\nplay a more relevant role than ever before. For the \r\nSecurity Council to live up to its expected \r\nresponsibilities, we need to make it more \r\nrepresentative and effective. I therefore renew Japan’s \r\ndetermination to pursue early reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, with the expansion of both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership. As has been reiterated \r\ntime and time again, no reform of the United Nations \r\nwill be complete without reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. The momentum for such reform, renewed by \r\nformer Assembly President Al-Khalifa, must be \r\nstrengthened as we enter the sixty-second session. All \r\nMember States must work together so that we can \r\nachieve concrete results through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during this session. \r\n What is required today is not to wait for change, \r\nbut to bring it about. The question is not what to expect \r\nof the United Nations, but how we may revitalize the \r\nOrganization. We need to enhance the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations to deal with new challenges. \r\n In addition to striving to implement Security \r\nCouncil reform, Japan will actively engage in efforts to \r\nstrengthen the ability of the United Nations to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. Japan also supports \r\nthe ongoing endeavours to enable the United Nations \r\nsystem to work more coherently and effectively in the \r\nareas of development, humanitarian assistance, the \r\nenvironment and human rights. At the same time, we \r\nneed to achieve concrete results in management \r\nreform. \r\n In connection with reform, let me remind \r\nMember States that world leaders took a major step \r\nforward in 2005 by resolving to delete the long-\r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n57 07-52121 \r\n \r\nobsolete “enemy States” clauses from the United \r\nNations Charter at the earliest opportunity (see \r\nresolution 60/1, para. 177). Next year, Japan will take \r\ncentre stage in international efforts. At TICAD IV in \r\nYokohama and the G-8 Summit at Tokyo, Japan will \r\nset forth principles for dealing with imminent \r\ninternational challenges. I hope to bring back solid \r\nresults to New York a year from now.  \r\n Let me conclude my remarks by renewing Japan’s \r\nunwavering commitment to work, in close cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations, to change the world for the \r\nbetter. \r\n The President: I should like to congratulate \r\nMr. Koumura on his recent appointment as Minister for \r\nJapan. \r\n We have heard the last speaker in the general \r\ndebate for this meeting. Several representatives have \r\nasked to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I \r\nremind members that statements in exercise of the right \r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n I shall now call on those representatives who \r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. \r\n Mr. Mavroyiannis (Cyprus): I am taking the \r\nfloor to exercise my right of reply to the statement \r\nmade earlier today by His Excellency the Prime \r\nMinister of Turkey, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. \r\nMr. Erdoğan referred to the so-called Turkish republic \r\nof northern Cyprus. I will not elaborate on that \r\nimaginary entity, created by Turkey in the area of \r\nCyprus it has occupied since 1974 and which has been \r\ncondemned by the Security Council in its resolutions \r\n541 (1983) and 550 (1984). I will only point out that \r\nthis insistence on promoting it verifies that Turkey has \r\nno interest in the reunification of Cyprus and is making \r\nno effort to that end. Firmly glued to the past, the \r\nTurkish Prime Minister continues to recite his \r\ncountry’s long-standing position on the 2004 Annan \r\nPlan to solve the Cyprus problem. He fails to mention, \r\nhowever, that his country’s fondness for that Plan \r\nderives from the fact that it was deliberately tailored to \r\nsuit its interests and was therefore risk-free for it. In \r\naddition, the acceptance of a plan that was prearranged \r\nto entail no unmanageable or unfavourable after-effects \r\nfor Turkey is by no means an accomplishment. \r\n Mr. Erdoğan’s assessment of why the Greek \r\nCypriot community was compelled in exercise of their \r\ndemocratic rights to overwhelmingly reject the Plan is \r\ninsulting and falls outside the boundaries of diplomatic \r\nconvention. In addition, Mr. Erdoğan is in no position \r\nto speak of intransigence, since the non-settlement of \r\nthe Cyprus problem after all these years is due \r\nexclusively to the refusal of Turkey and its supporting \r\nTurkish Cypriot leadership to negotiate on the core of \r\nthe Cyprus question.  \r\n It is ironic that Mr. Erdoğan is calling for the \r\nresumption of negotiations when his side has been \r\ngradually driving to ruins an ongoing dialogue on the \r\nimplementation of the carefully crafted 8 July 2006 \r\nagreement, which is the only existing process and \r\nwhich can lead to meaningful negotiations through a \r\ngradual approach that is based on progress ultimately \r\nyielding a comprehensive settlement. \r\n It is not enough to rehearse a series of \r\nunsubstantiated slogans that are devoid of meaning and \r\ncontribution. That applies to the entirety of \r\nMr. Erdoğan’s statement vis-à-vis Cyprus, including \r\nthe reference to restrictions imposed on Turkish \r\nCypriots. What Mr. Erdoğan means by this, of course, \r\nis the situation Turkish Cypriots find themselves in \r\nbecause of his country’s invasion of Cyprus. Even so, \r\nTurkish Cypriots enjoy a per capita income that \r\nTurkish citizens would envy. If Mr. Erdoğan aims at \r\npromoting the economic development of Turkish \r\nCypriots, then all he has to do is lift the restrictions his \r\narmy imposes through the occupation of one third of \r\nCyprus, so that Turkish Cypriots may go back to living \r\nin normal conditions.  \r\n As equal citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, \r\nTurkish Cypriots enjoy a high level of social and other \r\nprotection by the Cyprus Government, but of course in \r\na manner that simply does not accommodate the illegal \r\nregime. The Government of Cyprus has no doubt about \r\nits sovereignty over the totality of its territory, its \r\nterritorial sea and its airspace or about its sovereign \r\nrights over its exclusive economic area, its continental \r\nshelf and the resources therein. It has never sought \r\nanything more than peaceful existence. But as if it \r\nwere not enough for the aggressor to have denied us \r\nthat for all these years, Turkey adds insult to injury by \r\nquestioning my country’s sovereign rights and coveting \r\nits sovereign resources and by using its power to \r\nmalevolently prevent my country from attaining the \r\npeaceful existence and coexistence it so desires.  \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 58 \r\n \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): I am \r\nspeaking in exercise of the right of reply to respond to \r\nthe unacceptable claims made by the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates. This \r\nafternoon the Foreign Minister of the United Arab \r\nEmirates made some unacceptable claims against \r\nIranian territorial integrity in the vicinity of the Persian \r\nGulf. The Islamic Republic of Iran has clearly and \r\nrepeatedly put on record its position on this issue, and I \r\ndo not intend to repeat it here in detail.  \r\n Suffice it to say that the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nis fully committed to its international obligations, \r\nespecially those arising from the memorandum of \r\nunderstanding of 1971 between Iran and Sharjah on \r\nthis very issue. We firmly believe that \r\nmisunderstandings over the interpretation or \r\napplication of that memorandum of understanding, if \r\nany, should be addressed with goodwill and through \r\nmutually agreed mechanisms in order to find an \r\nacceptable solution. My Government has always \r\nwelcomed interaction and exchange of views between \r\nthe relevant officials of Iran and the United Arab \r\nEmirates on issues of mutual interest and concern. We \r\nalways give the highest priority to promoting friendly \r\nrelations with the brotherly littoral countries of the \r\nPersian Gulf. We firmly believe that continuous \r\ndialogue between the two States, based on mutual \r\nrespect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity, could continue, in order to remove any \r\nexisting misunderstanding. \r\n Mr. Al-Hebsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): On behalf of my country’s delegation I should \r\nlike, once again, to express our disappointment at what \r\nhas just been said by a member of the Iranian \r\ndelegation with regard to the Emirates’ three occupied \r\nislands — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates regrets that such untrue \r\nclaims continue to be made by the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran on the pretext of what it calls a misunderstanding \r\nover the islands. But in reality, this is an attempt to \r\ncover up attempts to change historical, legal and \r\npolitical facts pertaining to its occupation of these \r\nislands. We consider that unbalanced Iranian policy to \r\nbe a clear violation of the principles of the United \r\nNations Charter and international law as well as the \r\nfirm foundations that govern international relations and \r\nthe principle of good-neighbourliness between \r\ncountries.  \r\n We wonder why the Islamic Republic of Iran has \r\ncontinued for years to refuse to respond to repeated \r\npeaceful initiatives by my country calling for serious \r\nand direct bilateral negotiations on the details of this \r\nissue in order to guarantee a fair resolution, or for \r\nresort to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to seek \r\na fair legal opinion on the matter. We interpret Iran’s \r\ncontinued rejection of these peaceful initiatives as a \r\nweakness in the political and legal argument that it \r\nuses to entrench its unjust and illegitimate military \r\noccupation of our three islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser \r\nTunb and Abu Musa.  \r\n This comes at a time when my country has all the \r\nfacts, documents and historical, legal and demographic \r\nevidence that prove that those islands fall under the \r\nnational sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates.  \r\n We therefore hope once again that the Iranian \r\nGovernment will reconsider its policy and respond \r\nseriously to my country’s language of logic and \r\nwisdom in order to reach a just, comprehensive and \r\nequitable resolution of this issue in conformity with \r\ninternational law — a resolution that would return the \r\nthree islands to United Arab Emirates sovereignty. If \r\nthat were to be achieved, it would strengthen good-\r\nneighbourliness and cooperation between our two \r\ncountries and peoples and would help to spread peace, \r\nsecurity, stability and prosperity throughout the region. \r\n Mr. Pak Tok Hun (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): I should like to speak in exercise \r\nof the right of reply to the statement just made by the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Japan. In his statement, \r\nhe mentioned the issue of the abduction of a few \r\nJapanese, distorting the facts by saying that nothing \r\nhas been done concerning this issue. In fact, when the \r\ndelegation of Japanese political parties, led by the \r\nformer Prime Minister of Japan, Tomiichi Murayama, \r\nvisited Korea in 1999, Mr. Murayama asked my \r\nGovernment to confirm the whereabouts of the \r\n13 Japanese who had been reported missing. So my \r\nGovernment, taking the humanitarian nature of the \r\nissue of the missing persons into consideration, \r\norganized a special investigative committee in 2002 to \r\nconduct the investigation on a nationwide scale. The \r\nresults of the investigation proved that there were cases \r\nin which some Japanese had been abducted by \r\nindividual Koreans, dating from the late 1970s and \r\nearly 1980s.  \r\n A/62/PV.11\r\n \r\n59 07-52121 \r\n \r\n So, during the visit by former Japanese Prime \r\nMinister Koizumi to my country in 2002, the Japanese \r\nside was informed of the results of the investigation, \r\nnamely that the 13 missing Japanese were confirmed to \r\nbe abductees. Formal regret was also expressed for the \r\nemergence of the abduction issue. Five of them were \r\nstill alive and eight had died. \r\n It was by no means a cynical decision that the \r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea opted to settle, among other things, the issue of \r\na few more than 10 Japanese abductees out of sincerity, \r\nin particular given the fact that Japan forcibly drafted \r\nmore than 8.4 million Koreans, killing more than \r\n1 million and forcing 200,000 Korean girls and women \r\ninto sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army. \r\nFurthermore, in November 2004 my country provided \r\nevery facility to the Japanese Government joint \r\ndelegation made up of relevant officials from the \r\nCabinet, Foreign Ministry and National Police Agency \r\nand medical-legal experts, so that they could visit my \r\ncountry for a week and confirm on the spot the deaths \r\nof the aforementioned Japanese. As I have already \r\nmentioned, thanks to the sincere efforts exerted by the \r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, five survivors from among the 13 abductees, \r\nand all of their seven sons and daughters, went to \r\nJapan.  \r\n Those are the real facts of what we have done in \r\norder to solve with sincerity this abduction issue. We \r\nhave dealt with this issue with sincerity and will also \r\ndo that in future. If Japan continues to insist on its \r\nposition that all those abductees should be returned to \r\nJapan, then the abduction issue can be settled only \r\nwhen the dead return to life and all those missing \r\nJapanese reappear. We hope that the Japanese side will \r\naccept today’s reality concerning the abduction issue \r\nand deal with it with prudence. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): I \r\napologize for taking the floor again. It is so unfortunate \r\nthat our very good neighbour country tried to change \r\nthe nature of a bilateral problem, in two senses: \r\ntechnicality and locality. It is a change in terms of \r\ntechnicality because it is a change from our technical \r\nunderstanding of existing bilateral agreements through \r\nthe memorandum of understanding of 1971 between \r\nthe two countries, at the time between Iran and \r\nSharjah, turning it into a multilateral problem by \r\nexpanding it to the International Court of Justice and to \r\nother regional countries that have no direct relationship \r\nto the problem at all.  \r\n The locality of the problem could be resolved \r\nbetween the two parties on the basis of the \r\nmemorandum of understanding of the time. My country \r\nis totally available and accessible, and is willing to \r\nresolve this issue bilaterally. \r\n Mr. Shinyo (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nrespond to the statement just made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. The statement made by the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is entirely \r\ngroundless, and we cannot accept it. The abduction \r\nissue has not been solved. The abduction issue still \r\nexists. Therefore, we cannot accept the allegation made \r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The \r\nabduction issue is a most serious issue, not only for \r\nJapan in that it relates directly to the lives and security \r\nof Japanese citizens, but for the entire international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n The resolution on the human rights situation in \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea adopted \r\nlast December by the General Assembly (resolution \r\n61/174), explicitly expressed very serious concern at \r\nunresolved questions of international concern relating \r\nto the abduction of foreigners in the form of an \r\nenforced disappearance, which violates the human \r\nrights of the nationals of other sovereign countries.  \r\n The Government of Japan has identified 17 \r\nJapanese citizens who were victims of abduction by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. Of the 17, \r\nonly 5 have returned to Japan. Of the remaining 12 the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea claims that \r\n8 are dead and four never entered the country, and that \r\nthe abduction issue has therefore been resolved. That is \r\nnot a satisfactory explanation. It is not true. For the \r\nfates of those 12 victims, no satisfactory explanation \r\nhas ever been provided by the authorities of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. Under the \r\ncircumstances Japan has to believe that the 12 victims \r\nare still alive.  \r\n The fundamental policy of Japan remains \r\nunchanged. Based on the Pyongyang Declaration, \r\nJapan will continue to make every effort to normalize \r\nrelations through the settlement of the unfortunate past \r\nand through comprehensive resolution of outstanding \r\nproblems such as those relating to nuclear issues, the \r\nabductions and missile issues. Japan would like to \r\nA/62/PV.11  \r\n \r\n07-52121 60 \r\n \r\nconsult with the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea on concrete steps that might be taken towards \r\nnormalization based on the outcome of the recent \r\nmeeting of the working group on the normalization of \r\nJapan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nrelations. \r\n Numbers of Korean people who were taken to \r\nJapan during the Second World War were also \r\n \r\nmentioned. The numbers cited by the representative of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are totally \r\ngroundless. Such an argument lacks evidence and is not \r\nwell proven, so we are not able to accept that \r\nallegation made by the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n The meeting rose at 9.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
