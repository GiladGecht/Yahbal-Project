(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Tzipi Livni, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Israel. \r\n Ms. Livni (Israel): Three thousand years ago, the \r\npeople of Israel journeyed from slavery in Egypt to \r\nindependence in the land of Israel. The Bible tells us \r\nthat on their voyage to liberty they made a crucial stop \r\nand received the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai. \r\n As the General Assembly gathers this year, the \r\nJewish people recall that historic journey by marking \r\nthe festival of Sukkot. And every year, at this time, our \r\npeople remember that the long march to freedom \r\nrequires the acceptance of humanity’s basic values. \r\n For 60 years, since the rebirth of our State in our \r\nancient homeland, with Jerusalem at its heart, we have \r\nnot lost sight of this principle. The core values of \r\ntolerance, coexistence and peace that lie at the heart of \r\nevery democracy must be protected within societies \r\nand promoted between them. This is the calling of our \r\ngeneration. \r\n The conflict in our region is driven by those who \r\nreject these core values — those who seek power \r\nwithout responsibility, those whose aim is not to \r\nrealize their own rights but to deny those rights for \r\nothers. At its heart, this is a conflict not about territory, \r\nbut about values. \r\n There is, of course, a territorial dimension to our \r\ndispute. We know this and, as we have proven in the \r\npast, we are prepared for the territorial compromise \r\nthat lasting peace entails. But we also know, especially \r\nafter withdrawing from Lebanon and Gaza, that \r\nterritorial withdrawal by itself will not bring peace \r\nunless we address the core clash of values that lies \r\nbeneath the conflict. \r\n Israel may be on the front lines of this battle, but \r\nit is not our fight alone. This is a global battle. The \r\nnotion that this battle is a local one, limited to isolated \r\nregions, collapsed in this city with the twin towers on a \r\nSeptember morning six years ago. Today, it is clear that \r\nthe extremists are engaged in a bloody war against \r\ncivilians and communities, against hearts and minds, in \r\nevery corner of the world. \r\n And it is clear, too, that the Middle East conflict \r\nis not the cause of this global extremist agenda, but a \r\nconsequence of it. Yes, it is up to the parties in the \r\nMiddle East to settle their political conflict, and Israel, \r\nfor its part, desires to do so. But for success to be \r\ngenuine and lasting, you, the nations of the world, need \r\nto be partners in a shared global struggle against the \r\nextremism and terror that feed conflict, for your sake, \r\nnot just for ours. \r\n It is in this spirit that I would like to speak today \r\nabout resolving our particular conflict, but also about  \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 2 \r\n \r\nthe wider battle being waged today — the battle that \r\naffects us all. This battle is global, not just because it \r\ntargets civilians everywhere, but also because the \r\nextremists have taken aim at the fundamental pillars of \r\nevery modern society — namely, democracy, tolerance \r\nand education. These are the new battlefields of the \r\ntwenty-first century, and it is in these arenas, more than \r\nany other, that the future of our world will be decided. \r\n I believe in democracy. I believe in its \r\nextraordinary power to produce free and peaceful \r\nsocieties founded on respect for human rights. \r\nDemocracy is a profound ideal, but it is also a \r\nvulnerable one. \r\n Today, in different parts of the world, extremists, \r\nwho are opposed to the very ideals of democracy, are \r\nentering the democratic process, not to abandon their \r\nviolent agenda but to advance it. As a spokesman for \r\nAl-Qaida recently declared, “We will use your \r\ndemocracy to destroy your democracy”. This should be \r\na wake-up call for all of us. \r\n It is time to reclaim democracy, and this begins \r\nby rejecting those who abuse it. Genuine democracy is \r\nabout values before it is about voting. No true \r\ndemocracy on Earth allows armed militia or groups \r\nwith racist or violent agendas to participate in \r\nelections. But some demonstrate a troubling double \r\nstandard. There are some who insist on high standards \r\nin their own country but forget them when they look \r\nabroad. Violent extremists who could never run for \r\noffice at home are treated as legitimate politicians \r\nwhen elected elsewhere. As a result, we empower those \r\nwho use democratic means to advance anti-democratic \r\nends. And we strengthen the forces of those who not \r\nonly undermine their societies but also threaten our \r\nown. \r\n Today, from this podium, I call on the \r\ninternational community to adopt at the global level \r\nwhat democracies apply at the national one: a universal \r\nset of standards for participation in genuine democratic \r\nelections. We need a universal democratic code that \r\nrequires that all those seeking the legitimacy of the \r\ndemocratic process earn it by respecting such \r\nprinciples as State monopoly over the lawful use of \r\nforce, the rejection of racism and violence and the \r\nprotection of the rights of others. \r\n The goal of such a universal code is not to dictate \r\nour values or to stifle legitimate voices with which we \r\nmay disagree. Its goal is to protect core democratic \r\nvalues from those determined to use the democratic \r\nsystem against itself; and to make clear that \r\nparticipation in the democratic process is not just a \r\nright — it is also a responsibility. \r\n I know that the temptation to engage with \r\nextremists can be strong. It may seem to promise \r\nstability and quiet. We may hope that by feeding the \r\nbeast we can gradually tame it. As free societies, we \r\npride ourselves, rightly, on our respect for difference \r\nand diversity. But we do a disservice to diversity when, \r\nin its name, we tolerate the intolerant. \r\n Bitter experience has shown that buying off \r\nextremists is a short-term fix for which we will pay \r\ndearly in the long run. Instead, groups such as Hamas \r\nand Hizbullah must be presented with a clear choice \r\nbetween the path of violence and the path of \r\nlegitimacy. They cannot have both. And it is this same \r\nstark choice that must be presented to the radical \r\nregime in Iran. \r\n No responsible State disagrees that Iran is the \r\nmost prominent sponsor of terrorism. It is a major \r\nsource of instability and conflict in Iraq, Lebanon, \r\nPalestine and across the entire Middle East; and it is \r\nthe enemy of Arab-Israeli coexistence. No one \r\ndisagrees that Iran denies the Holocaust and speaks \r\nopenly of its desire to wipe a Member State — mine — \r\noff the map. And no one disagrees that, in violation of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, it is actively pursuing the \r\nmeans to achieve this end. \r\n But there are still those who, in the name of \r\nconsensus and engagement, continue to obstruct the \r\nurgent steps that are needed to bring Iran’s sinister \r\nambitions to a halt. Too many see the danger, but they \r\nwalk idly by, hoping that someone else will take care \r\nof it. What is the value, we have to ask, of an \r\norganization which is unable to take effective action in \r\nthe face of a direct assault on the very principles it was \r\nfounded to protect? \r\n It is time for the United Nations, and the States of \r\nthe world, to live up to their promise of never again, to \r\nsay enough is enough, to act now and to defend their \r\nbasic values. It is also time to see this same kind of \r\nmoral conviction in the Human Rights Council, so that \r\nit can become a shield for the victims of human rights, \r\nnot a weapon for its abusers. \r\n Israel has never tried to avoid genuine discussion \r\nof its human rights record. But so long as the Council \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n3 07-52293 \r\n \r\nmaintains its wildly disproportionate focus on Israel, it \r\nweakens the moral voice of the United Nations, and the \r\nprice of this blindness is paid by the victims of human \r\nrights atrocities in Darfur and Myanmar and \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n There is no more accurate forecast for the future \r\nof a society than the lessons we teach our children. \r\nUnfortunately, in our region, we see children’s \r\ntelevision programmes in which Mickey Mouse \r\npuppets teach the glory of being a suicide bomber and \r\na seven-year old girl sings of her dreams of blood and \r\nbattle. Religion, rather than being a source of hope and \r\nspiritual healing, is abused as a call to arms, as God is \r\ndragged once again onto the field of battle. \r\n It is time to reclaim religion from those who have \r\nmade it a weapon rather than a shelter. It is time to \r\nreclaim education from those who use it as a tool of \r\nhate rather than an opportunity. As always, the most \r\npowerful form of education, and the hardest, is to teach \r\nby example. We cannot expect our younger generation \r\nto value what we are not prepared ourselves to protect \r\nand pay a price for. And there is a price to pay. From \r\nthe leader who has to withstand public pressures. From \r\nthe businessman who has to forgo economic \r\nopportunity. From the teacher and spiritual guide who \r\nmust find the inner strength to teach truth and tolerance \r\nin a climate of extremism and hostility. At all levels of \r\nsociety, there is a price to be paid. But if we do not pay \r\nit today, we, and those who follow us, will face a far \r\ngreater bill tomorrow. \r\n These thoughts are in my mind as we seek, today, \r\nto advance the cause of Israeli-Palestinian \r\nreconciliation. Reconciliation is not about deciding \r\nwho was right or who was wrong in the past; it is about \r\nsharing a common vision and a common responsibility \r\nfor the future. In the last months, Prime Minister \r\nOlmert and President Abbas have been engaged in a \r\nsincere and genuine effort to reach the widest possible \r\ncommon ground on political understandings. There is \r\nno substitute for the bilateral process. Failure is not an \r\noption, but it is for the parties themselves to define \r\nsuccess. The foundation for true peace lies in the vision \r\nof two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side \r\nin peace and security. The world shares this vision, but \r\nit is also important that it clearly embrace the two core \r\nprinciples that emerge from it. \r\n The first of these principles is: two States, two \r\nhomelands. Just as Israel is homeland to the Jewish \r\npeople, so Palestine will be established as the \r\nhomeland and the national answer for the Palestinian \r\npeople, including the refugees. \r\n The second is: living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity. Just as a viable and prosperous Palestine in \r\nthe West Bank and Gaza is an Israeli interest, so must a \r\nsecure Israel be a Palestinian interest. The world \r\ncannot afford another terror State. \r\n Guided by these principles, the parties can define \r\na common border and turn the two-State vision from a \r\ndream into reality. To succeed, we must set our sights \r\non a brighter future, while responding to the challenges \r\nof the present and learning the lessons of the past. As \r\nwe make progress on concrete political understandings, \r\nit is just as important to change the reality on the \r\nground — to show Palestinians and Israelis that the \r\npromise of peace exists in practice, not just on paper. \r\n In recent months, Israel has taken tangible \r\nmeasures to create a better environment, and we are \r\nready to do more. We know that Palestinian life is full \r\nof day-to-day hardship. We know also, and only too \r\nwell, the burden of terror that Israelis bear and of our \r\nprimary obligation to their security. Together, we can \r\nchange this reality; we do not need to submit to it. \r\n We are not naive. We can see the difficulties \r\nahead and the enemies of peace that stand in our way. \r\nBut practical progress is possible in those areas where \r\nthere is an effective Palestinian Government that \r\naccepts the Quartet’s principles and implements, \r\nalongside Israel, the existing Road Map obligations. \r\n As the parties take the risks for peace, we look to \r\nthe international community and the Arab and Muslim \r\nworld to offer support, not to stipulate conditions. This \r\nsupport comes in many forms. It comes through \r\neconomic and political assistance to the new \r\nPalestinian Government committed to coexistence and \r\nseeking to build the foundations of a peaceful and \r\nprosperous State. It comes through the clear \r\nendorsement of any political understandings reached \r\nbetween the parties. It comes through enhancing and \r\ndeepening regional ties and cooperation between the \r\nArab world and Israel, while in parallel we advance \r\ntowards Israeli-Palestinian peace. And, finally, it \r\ncomes by confronting those determined to prevent us \r\nfrom succeeding. \r\n We must stand up to those who have no respect \r\nfor human life or human liberty, those who hold \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 4 \r\n \r\ncaptive soldiers — Gilad Shalit, Udi Goldwasser and \r\nEldad Regev — whose families are with us today and \r\nwhose pain remains always in our hearts. \r\n We must stand up to those who, after we \r\nwithdrew from Gaza to give peace a chance, chose not \r\nto build but to destroy and who choose, on a daily \r\nbasis, to target Israeli homes and kindergartens with \r\ntheir missiles. \r\n And we must stand up to those who see \r\ndemocracy as a tool to advance hate, who see tolerance \r\nas a one-way street and who see education as a means \r\nof poisoning the minds of the next generation. \r\n I believe that, despite all the obstacles, there is a \r\nnew moment of opportunity and an alliance of interest \r\nthat favours peace. Time is of the essence. We owe it to \r\nourselves and to our children to find both the courage \r\nand the wisdom to make the right choices in the right \r\nway. \r\n On this festival of Sukkot, Jews commemorate \r\nthe journey from slavery to freedom by leaving their \r\nhomes to live in fragile huts, like the shelters in which \r\nour ancestors lived on their way to the Promised Land. \r\nFor 3,000 years, these temporary huts, open to the \r\nelements, have been a reminder that stability and \r\nsecurity are ensured not only by the structures that we \r\nbuild but also by the values that we share. Perhaps it is \r\nfor this reason that the Sukkah, this fragile shelter, has \r\nbecome the Jewish symbol of peace. \r\n We turn to Jerusalem and say in our prayers every \r\nday: Spread over us the canopy of your peace. May it \r\nbe in our days, and for all nations. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, Deputy Prime Minister in \r\ncharge of Foreign Affairs, Cooperation, La \r\nFrancophonie and Regional Integration of Gabon and \r\nformer President of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Ping (Gabon) (spoke in French): At the \r\nbeginning of my statement, I would like to convey my \r\nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. Your election, Mr. President, \r\nconstitutes undoubtedly significant recognition of your \r\ncountry for its prioritized and resolute actions with \r\nrespect to implementation of the goals of the United \r\nNations. But it is also, in personal terms, the successful \r\noutcome of a long and fruitful career as a diplomat and  \r\nprofessor of international relations. In addition, in \r\nwarmly congratulating you, I would like to assure you \r\nof the support my country, and of my own support, as \r\nyou carry out your challenging and noble mission. \r\n Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \r\nfor the dedication, wisdom and skill with which she \r\nsteered our deliberations, and particularly for her \r\nhaving led the necessary negotiations with respect to \r\nconsideration and implementation of the important \r\nrecommendations of the 2005 World Summit, which \r\nincluded reform of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the Security Council. \r\n To the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, I \r\nwould like to express my full encouragement as he \r\ncarries out his functions at the head of the United \r\nNations. The major reform that he has initiated in order \r\nto adapt the Organization to the needs of a world in \r\nconstant change deserves everyone’s support. \r\n The theme for the general debate, climate change, \r\nwhich you have proposed for this year, is one of the \r\nprimary concerns of the international community. The \r\nselection of this very theme by the Secretary-General \r\nas the framework for the discussion during the high-\r\nlevel debate that was just held is additional evidence of \r\nthis. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005 and \r\nwas a major historical milestone in the process of \r\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n With respect to trends in this phenomenon, every \r\none can note that the goals set forth in the Protocol \r\nhave yet to be fully achieved. We, therefore, need to do \r\nour utmost so that the Bali meeting in Indonesia, slated \r\nfor December 2007, will be an opportunity to reach \r\nagreement on a common, global strategy in order to \r\ncarry out more robust, collective action to mitigate \r\nsignificantly the negative effects of global warming. \r\n Africa, which contributes least of all to the \r\nworsening of this phenomenon, is unfairly undergoing \r\nthe serious consequences of it. Therefore, the principle \r\nof common but differentiated responsibilities needs to \r\nbe applied. For its part, Gabon, whose forest is one of \r\nthe essential components of the major Congo Basin, \r\nthe second ecological lung of the planet after the \r\nAmazon, has unreservedly acceded to the Convention \r\non Biological Diversity and has joined up in the fight \r\nagainst climate change. \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n5 07-52293 \r\n \r\n Moreover, it has decided to devote 11 per cent of \r\nits territory to humankind, particularly by establishing \r\n13 national parks. Recently, Lopé park was named as a \r\nnew UNESCO world heritage site, and Gabon is \r\nprepared to go much further, because protection of the \r\nenvironment is an important pillar in the fight against \r\npoverty and an essential condition to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n As is evident, then, Gabon has undertaken \r\nconsiderable efforts in order to bring about greater \r\nprotection of nature and of ecosystems. As a result, \r\nGabon, together with other African countries, deserves \r\nto benefit from compensatory measures from \r\nindustrialized countries, the main emitters of carbon \r\ndioxide.  \r\n From this standpoint, we urge the establishment \r\nof a stabilization fund to compensate for existing forest \r\ncarbon stocks. We also would like to ensure that our \r\nforests are included in the carbon market mechanisms.  \r\n The General Assembly is the appropriate forum \r\nto discuss the major challenges that our world is \r\nfacing. That was the strong message reaffirmed by the \r\nworld’s leaders when they assembled here for the \r\nSeptember 2005 world summit. I welcome the fact that \r\nthe major decisions taken at that time continue to drive \r\nthe reform of our Organization.  \r\n The report of the High-level Panel on United \r\nNations System-wide Coherence indicates the scope of \r\nthe changes to be made to ensure greater effectiveness \r\nin implementation of the Organization’s programmes. \r\nHere, I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-first session for \r\nhaving launched intergovernmental consultations on \r\nthis important issue. \r\n The intensive activities of the General Assembly \r\nin recent years clearly attests to its central role as the \r\nprincipal representative organ and deliberative body \r\nresponsible for setting the policies of the Organization. \r\nI have no doubt that you, Sir, will continue your efforts \r\nto strengthen the authority and primary role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Similarly, one of the key measures \r\nthat our Organization needs to bring about to improve \r\nthe implementation and ensure the legitimacy of its \r\ndecisions is reform of the Security Council. We will \r\nneed to reach agreement in order to carry out this \r\nreform that is so important for the future of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n This session is beginning in a complex and \r\nunstable international context that is marked by deep \r\ncrises and many kinds of threats. The geography of the \r\nconflicts puts the spotlight on Africa and the Middle \r\nEast.  \r\n In Africa, the situation in Darfur continues to be \r\nof concern. However, I would like to praise the efforts \r\nof the Sudanese Government, which has undertaken to \r\nparticipate in comprehensive peace talks on 27 October \r\n2007 in Tripoli and to accept the principle of a \r\nceasefire. Gabon, for its part, will continue to firmly \r\nsupport the national peace and reconciliation process in \r\nthe Sudan. To this end, it welcomes the adoption by the \r\nSecurity Council of resolution 1769 (2007), \r\nauthorizing the deployment of an Africa Union-United \r\nNations hybrid force in the Sudan.  \r\n Furthermore, Gabon, which has for many years \r\nplayed a major role in the many negotiations on \r\nnational reconciliation in Africa, supports the efforts \r\nundertaken by the European Union, particularly in \r\nprotecting civilians and providing humanitarian \r\nassistance in Chad and the Central African Republic.  \r\n Specifically with regard to Chad, Gabon is \r\ncurrently facilitating peace and reconciliation talks \r\namong factions in that country.  \r\n The instability in Somalia for the past 15 years \r\nhas negated any possibility of development. However, \r\nwe need to mention the praiseworthy decision of the \r\nPeace and Security Council of the African Union in \r\nauthorizing the deployment of a peacekeeping mission \r\nin that country.  \r\n With respect to the situation in the Middle East, \r\nmore specifically, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, only \r\nconcerted and sustained efforts based on the principle \r\nof two States, Israel and Palestine, coexisting in peace \r\nand security within secure and internationally \r\nrecognized borders, can bring about a lasting and just \r\nsettlement of this conflict.  \r\n My country endorses the idea of holding an \r\ninternational conference under the auspices of the \r\nQuartet, in order to relaunch the process of direct and \r\nconstructive negotiations.  \r\n With respect to Lebanon, Gabon reaffirms its \r\nsupport for implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1701 (2006). \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 6 \r\n \r\n With respect to the issue of international \r\nterrorism, I would like to commend the General \r\nAssembly’s adoption on 8 September 2006 of the \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. While politically \r\nthat is praiseworthy progress, nevertheless in legal \r\nterms we need to accelerate current negotiations in \r\norder to adopt a general counter-terrorism convention.  \r\n In the twenty-first century, threats to international \r\npeace and security are not limited solely to terrorism, \r\nwar and international conflicts. Organized crime, civil \r\nviolence, poverty, infectious diseases, natural disasters \r\nand weapons of mass destruction are also phenomena \r\nthat can undermine the survival and foundations of the \r\nState as the basic element of the international system. \r\n With respect to weapons of mass destruction, we \r\nneed urgently to end the stalemate in the multilateral \r\ntalks and to again place disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation issues at the forefront of the concerns of \r\nthe international community. Our collective security \r\ndepends on it.  \r\n On the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which severely \r\naffects many African countries, we need to act \r\nproportionately to the seriousness of this scourge. \r\nFurthermore, as was underscored in the political \r\ndeclaration on HIV/AIDS adopted in New York on \r\n2 June 2006 as the outcome of the high-level meeting \r\non that pandemic, the African countries are already \r\nallocating considerable financial resources to counter \r\nthis scourge. Despite these efforts, our countries \r\ncontinue to face a shortfall of the resources necessary \r\nto achieving universal access to prevention, care and \r\ntreatment by 2010. From this standpoint, Gabon \r\nwelcomes the commitment taken by Group of Eight \r\n(G-8) in Germany, granting to Africa under \r\ndevelopment assistance the amount of $60 billion to \r\nfight malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.  \r\n More than a year ago, our Organization gave \r\nitself a peacebuilding mechanism. Here, I would like to \r\nreiterate my appreciation of the work already done by \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission under the presidency of \r\nAngola, as well as by all of the members of the \r\nCommission for their efforts to devise an effective \r\nstrategy bringing together all the national and \r\ninternational players involved in the processes of \r\nreconstruction in Burundi and Sierra Leone. \r\n These countries, like all developing countries, \r\nneed ongoing support from the international \r\ncommunity, in accordance with the decisions taken \r\nunder the Monterrey Consensus and reaffirmed at the \r\n2005 World Summit. From this standpoint, the donor \r\ncountries need to meet their pledges for assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in the areas of debt \r\nrelief and opening their markets. To that end, the \r\nimplementation of the Doha programme is an \r\nimperative for developing countries and will \r\nparticularly enable countries in Africa to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  \r\n Similarly, we need to continue our brainstorming \r\nin order to identify and launch innovative sources for \r\ndevelopment financing. That is a priority objective for \r\nour countries, particularly since our resources are \r\nlimited because of debt reimbursement, and this \r\nprevents us from responding effectively to \r\ndevelopment needs. \r\n Here, I would like to pay tribute to the Paris \r\nClub, which has agreed to the principle of Gabon’s \r\nbuying back its debt. This agreement is key for Gabon \r\nin its legitimate quest for economic prosperity and \r\nsocial well-being. \r\n It is in this spirit of renewed international \r\nsolidarity and in effective partnership that we will be \r\nable to build a better world that respects the rights and \r\ndignity of the individual. This vision of the founding \r\nfathers of our Organization is also shared by my \r\ncountry and its President, El Hadj Omar Bongo \r\nOndimba, who has always been able to work for the \r\nprotection and promote human rights. \r\n In keeping with these values, the Government of \r\nGabon recently decided to abolish the death penalty \r\nand was a sponsor of the draft resolution on \r\nestablishing a moratorium on the death penalty. \r\n The United Nations has existed now for sixty-two \r\nyears. From the cold war to the collapse of the Berlin \r\nWall, it has been able to stand, together with the \r\nsociety of nations, the test of time. Unfortunately, \r\nhowever, and despite its long history, it has not been \r\nable to fully bring about the profound aspirations of \r\nliberty, equality and peace and justice, as expressed by \r\nthe peoples of the world. The ongoing reforms need to \r\nbe continued in order to enable the United Nations to \r\nbe the mirror of diversity and human values. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Hor Namhong, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation for \r\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia. \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n7 07-52293 \r\n \r\n Mr. Hor (Cambodia): First of all, I wish to \r\nwarmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Kerim of the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia for his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. I am confident that, under his able guidance, \r\nthis year’s session will be concluded with success. My \r\nappreciation also goes to Her Excellency Ms. Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain for her \r\nbrilliant leadership as the President of the sixty-first \r\nsession, which produced significant achievements \r\nduring the past year. \r\n I am also very delighted to express my most \r\ncordial felicitations to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-\r\nmoon on his appointment as the United Nations \r\nSecretary-General. I have no doubt that under his wise \r\nleadership our world body will certainly become even \r\nmore relevant and effective in responding to the \r\nchallenges facing us in the twenty-first century. \r\n Today, the world continues to confront a myriad \r\nof problems, ranging from peace and security to \r\ndevelopment, such as terrorism, regional conflicts, \r\npoverty, global warming, pandemic diseases, and so \r\nforth. These old and new emerging crises are indeed of \r\nglobal proportion, which require greater collective \r\nefforts by the world community. Therefore, as United \r\nNations Member States, we have to share the common \r\nresponsibility to address these issues more effectively \r\nfor the sake of humanity. \r\n Concerning weapons of mass destruction \r\n(WMDs), it is imperative that all States fully comply \r\nwith the existing non-proliferation legal instruments in \r\norder to build a better and safer world for all, \r\nparticularly the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which laid \r\ndown a long-term perspective toward achieving a non-\r\nproliferation regime for WMDs and preventing them \r\nfrom falling into terrorist hands, which could trigger \r\nthe gravest of dangers to the international community. \r\n Combating terrorism remains one of the top \r\npriorities for all Governments. No single country can \r\ndeal with this unconventional threat without \r\ncooperation and concerted efforts, which should be \r\nfurther strengthened, particularly in the areas of \r\neducation and information-sharing among law \r\nenforcement authorities and intelligence agencies. \r\n In terms of security, we certainly cannot \r\nunderestimate the illegal use and circulation of small \r\narms and light weapons, as they can be an equally \r\ndangerous source of terrorism, violence and regional \r\nconflicts. In this context, Cambodia believes that the \r\n2001 United Nations Programme of Action on Small \r\nArms should remain the cornerstone for us all to work \r\ntogether to address this issue. In Cambodia, the Royal \r\nGovernment has developed a number of programmes, \r\nranging from law enforcement on arms control to a \r\nprogramme of weapons for development, which has \r\nsuccessfully led to the seizure and destruction of more \r\nthan 200,000 small arms and light weapons. \r\n Likewise, landmines still remain a serious threat \r\nto many nations in the developing world, especially \r\nthose facing armed conflicts as well as those emerging \r\nfrom war. These “silent killers” have destroyed the \r\nlives of many innocent peoples and maimed countless \r\nothers. Landmines are not only a security problem, but \r\na humanitarian one, as the victims become permanently \r\ntraumatized and physically handicapped, while their \r\nfamilies suffer untold misery and spiritual and material \r\ndeprivation. Landmines also have great impact on the \r\neconomy and development, as the victims constitute a \r\nheavy economic and social burden for governments. \r\n In Cambodia, the Royal Government is \r\ncontinuing its campaign of mine clearance by placing \r\nthe demining operation in its national agenda, such as \r\nthe Cambodian Millennium Development Goals and its \r\n“Rectangular Strategy”. By July this year, more than \r\n1.5 million landmines had been cleared. To share our \r\nown experiences with other countries that are also \r\nvictims of landmines, Cambodia has dispatched 135 \r\ndeminers of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to \r\nSudan for demining action under the umbrella of the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation. \r\n Everyone nowadays recognizes that climate \r\nchange has become one of the most serious threats to \r\nhumanity and affects the whole world in this new \r\ncentury. To reverse this negative megatrend, Cambodia \r\nis of the view that all countries should effectively \r\nimplement the relevant United Nations instruments, \r\nespecially the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. We also \r\ncall on countries that produce more greenhouse gases \r\nto commit to gradually reducing their emissions as \r\nmuch as possible.  \r\n At the same time, we need to develop and share \r\nknow-how on bioenergy in order to take measures \r\nagainst global warming. In addition, we need to stop \r\nthe deforestation in the developing countries by \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 8 \r\n \r\nassisting them with appropriate measures and \r\nresources. \r\n In the framework of the Association of South-\r\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN), our leaders will sign \r\nthree important documents related to climate change, \r\nenergy and environment during the coming ASEAN \r\nSummit in November of this year in Singapore. The \r\nsigning of these declarations clearly reflects the \r\npolitical commitments that ASEAN, both collectively \r\nand individually, has attached to the issues of climate \r\nchange. \r\n Cambodia highly appreciates the United Nations \r\ninitiative of convening the High-level Event on \r\nClimate Change here in New York on 24 September \r\nthis year. We hope that that high-level meeting will \r\nlead to significant and concrete actions to address \r\nopportunely this very critical issue. However, I believe \r\nthat a world summit under the auspices of the United \r\nNations would keep climate change alive on the agenda \r\nof world’s leaders. A global problem needs a global \r\nsolution. \r\n With regard to the regional situation, Cambodia \r\nwelcomes the agreement reached in February this year \r\nthrough the process of the six party talks leading to the \r\nclosing down of the nuclear facilities in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. This is a very positive step \r\nfor peace, security and stability in the region. We hope \r\nthat it will serve as an effective tool to pave the way \r\nfor complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \r\n Concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we \r\napplaud recent active diplomatic initiatives, in \r\nparticular the high-level talks between the Prime \r\nMinister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority. We hope that those meetings and activities \r\nwill lead to a definitive solution that establishes a State \r\nof Palestine, coexisting permanently and peacefully \r\nside by side with Israel, in order to end the killing and \r\nsuffering of their peoples and for the sake of peace and \r\nsecurity in the region. \r\n With regard to the current appalling situation in \r\nIraq, we applaud the recent decision of the United \r\nStates to sizeably reduce the number of its troops in the \r\ncountry. However, the final and decisive solution will \r\ndepend on how the Iraqi people reconcile among \r\nthemselves. That is a sine qua non for ending the civil \r\nwar in the country. Otherwise, I fear that chaos will \r\nensue after the withdrawal of United States troops. \r\n In the light of our own experience, I believe that \r\nthe only option that will bring peace and stability to \r\nIraq is national reconciliation, with a win-win policy \r\nfor Shiites and Sunnis. But the main question that we \r\nshould ponder is: who or which country can contribute \r\nto the initial process of confidence-building before any \r\ngenuine reconciliation can be achieved? \r\n This year marks the halfway point between the \r\nadoption of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) in September 2000 and the target date of \r\n2015. Notwithstanding some overall progress, \r\ndeveloping countries have been experiencing \r\ndifficulties in meeting the MDG targets. This is despite \r\nthe outcomes of the many high-level meetings that \r\nhave been taking place throughout the world aimed at \r\nimproving economic development and the livelihoods \r\nof peoples in developing countries, such as the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation. In reality, however, the situation of \r\ndeveloping countries has not improved much. What we \r\nneed now is strong commitment and political will on \r\nthe part of all, in particular those in the developed \r\nworld, to ensure that globalization will be a \r\nglobalization of wealth for all peoples living on this \r\nplanet. I hope that that is not just a dream, but a goal \r\nfor all. \r\n The Royal Government of Cambodia has come up \r\nwith its own MDGs, in addition to the rectangular \r\nstrategy and the national strategic development plan \r\n2006-2010, to work to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The carrying out \r\nof those national blueprints has yielded strong \r\neconomic growth that has averaged more than 11 per \r\ncent over the past three years.  \r\n Therefore, at the Annual Ministerial Review of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, held in Geneva in \r\nJuly of this year, Cambodia was invited, together with \r\nfive other countries, to make a national presentation on \r\nactual progress made in achieving our MDGs.  \r\n Concerning our Organization, the United Nations, \r\nwe are more than ever convinced of the urgent need for \r\ncomprehensive reform — and not just of the Security \r\nCouncil — because we need to mobilize our collective \r\nefforts and wisdom to address, in a responsive and \r\ncomprehensive way, the problems we are facing in the \r\ntwenty-first century. \r\n Mr. Al Bayati (Iraq), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n There is no doubt that the status quo does not \r\ncorrespond with the challenges confronting the world \r\ntoday. Cambodia is of the view that United Nations \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n9 07-52293 \r\n \r\nreform must be comprehensive. Therefore, instead of \r\nfocusing primarily on reform of the Security Council, \r\nperhaps we can start with reform that can garner a \r\nconsensus. For example, we could begin by \r\nconsidering how to make the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil more effective and more relevant so that it can \r\ndeal with the problems of development in the context \r\nof the MDGs. Then, of course, we also need to \r\nempower the General Assembly so that it can play a \r\nprominent role in addressing today’s global problems \r\nas a democratic, deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. Next, \r\nhaving built up momentum and consensus by \r\nreforming both the Economic and Social Council and \r\nthe Assembly, we could move on to reform of the \r\nSecurity Council to ensure that it reflects today’s \r\nrealities, with equitable representation for developed \r\nand developing countries. \r\n To conclude, I would like to say that our world is \r\ncurrently facing serious threats of great proportion and \r\nsevere regional crises. At the same time, development \r\nand poverty remain high on the agendas of countries in \r\nmany parts of the world. Therefore, the United Nations \r\nmust play a more leading role if it is to respond \r\neffectively to those challenges. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic. \r\n Mr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): At the outset, let me express, on behalf of \r\nthe Lao delegation, my cordial salutations and \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. I should also like to take this opportunity to \r\npay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his strong commitment to the reform process in \r\npursuit of a strong, fully mobile and multifunctional \r\nUnited Nations. His great efforts and dedication to the \r\ncause of enhancing peace and security and promoting \r\nglobal socio-economic development and justice also \r\ndeserve our praise.  \r\n The issue of development is becoming \r\nincreasingly prominent. Today, our world remains far \r\nfrom secure. Parts of our planet are beset by violence, \r\nnatural disasters and pandemics. All of humankind \r\ncontinues to live under the threat of nuclear weapons \r\nand in fear of terror and the spread of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. That fear will become much greater if \r\nthose weapons fall into the wrong hands. Furthermore, \r\nthe use or threat of use of force to resolve international \r\nproblems, together with violations of the sovereignty \r\nof Member States, persists. That hinders progress in the \r\nenhancement of international peace and security and \r\ndevelopment cooperation among Member States. \r\n Despite the fact that globalization offers new \r\nopportunities for development, developing countries — \r\nin particular least developed, landlocked and small \r\nisland developing States — have not reaped its \r\nbenefits, as they ought to be able to do. That is due \r\nprimarily to a lack of basic infrastructure, as well as a \r\nlack of access to markets, modern technology, \r\nfinancing and investment. In order to guarantee greater \r\nbenefits for the most vulnerable countries, the \r\ninternational community must intensify its concerted \r\nefforts to assist them in fully and effectively \r\nimplementing its respective programmes of action, as \r\ncalled for in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1). This should include strengthened \r\ninternational partnerships, increased official \r\ndevelopment assistance, greater market access and \r\nspecial and preferential tariffs for their exports.  \r\n Further measures should be taken to ensure debt \r\nsustainability, technology transfer and the promotion of \r\nequitable structures of international trade and finance \r\nin favour of those vulnerable countries. In addition, the \r\ninternational community should give priority to the \r\nprovision of both financial assistance, in the form of \r\ngrant aid or soft loans to those countries, and technical \r\nassistance. \r\n The world community is facing challenges caused \r\nby human activity, such as climate change, which \r\naffects all nations, rich and poor. Yet the Member \r\nStates who suffer most from this catastrophe are the \r\nleast developed countries and small island developing \r\nStates, due to their lack of resources and capacity for \r\nadaptation. In that context, I believe that the outcome \r\nof the High-level Event on Climate Change will \r\nsignificantly contribute to successful negotiations on a \r\ncomprehensive agreement under the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change to deal \r\nwith the matter.  \r\n I hereby affirm that efforts to address climate \r\nchange should not compromise attainment of the \r\ndevelopment objectives of developing countries. \r\nAddressing the issue should fully cover the three \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 10 \r\n \r\npillars of sustainable development. The efforts should \r\nbe based on the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibility between the developed and developing \r\ncountries. In order to enable the developing countries, \r\nparticularly the two most vulnerable groups among \r\nthem, to achieve sustainable development and address \r\nclimate change, the developed countries should provide \r\nthem with the necessary financing for adaptation, \r\nmitigation and the transfer of appropriate technology. \r\n For the United Nations to meet the daunting \r\nchallenges that lie ahead, it should transform itself into \r\na strong, efficient and effective organization. To that \r\nend, the United Nations reform process should be \r\nconducted in a comprehensive, inclusive, transparent \r\nand balanced manner. A strong and effective United \r\nNations would better perform its mandate to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security through the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and the promotion of \r\ninternational cooperation for development. However, \r\nthe United Nations reform process would not be \r\ncomplete without the Security Council being \r\nrestructured into a more legitimate, representative, \r\ndemocratic and effective organ. \r\n Like other Member States, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic welcomes the progress achieved \r\nin the implementation of the outcome of the Six-Party \r\nTalks on the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula. We \r\nbelieve that through committed efforts by all concerned \r\nparties, the results of the talks will be fully translated \r\ninto action, thus contributing to the eventual \r\ndenuclearization of the region. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic reaffirms \r\nits continued support for the General Assembly \r\nresolutions urging an end to the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed on Cuba. Contrary to \r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter, those \r\ncoercive measures have caused great difficulties and \r\nlosses to the people of Cuba. \r\n The prolonged and persistent violence in the \r\nMiddle East remains a cause of concern to the world \r\ncommunity. As a result, the Palestinian, Lebanese and \r\nIraqi peoples have suffered great losses in human life \r\nand property. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nreaffirms its support for the Palestinian people in their \r\nstruggle for the right to self-determination, including \r\nthe right to establish a sovereign and independent State \r\nof Palestine, living side by side in peace with Israel \r\nand other countries in the region. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is \r\nenjoying unwavering peace, political and social \r\nstability and economic growth. This year is the second \r\nyear of the continued implementation of the country’s \r\nsixth Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan, \r\nfor 2006 to 2010. As a result, significant achievements \r\nhave been recorded. The poverty rate declined from 48 \r\nper cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2005. Opium \r\ncultivation was completely eradicated in 2006. The \r\npractice of shifting cultivation declined six times from \r\n2001 to 2005. Tourism, particularly cultural and \r\necotourism, has been broadly promoted and expanded, \r\nthus attracting more and more tourists to the country. \r\nThe Lao Government continues to pursue a \r\ndevelopment policy that is aimed at promotion of \r\nsustainable development, sustained use and \r\nconservation of natural resources, exploitation of clean \r\nenergy and protection of the environment and the \r\necosystem. \r\n In November 2006, in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the Lao \r\nGovernment held the ninth Round-Table Meeting, \r\nwhich provided a consultative forum for the \r\ndevelopment partners and various Lao Government \r\nagencies to engage in a constructive and frank dialogue \r\non development assistance. The meeting adopted the \r\nVientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which \r\nreflects the commitments of the Lao Government and \r\nits development partners to improve the coordination \r\nand effectiveness of official development assistance. \r\n In pursuance of its foreign policy of peace, \r\nfriendship and cooperation with all countries in the \r\nworld, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has had \r\ndiplomatic relations with 125 countries and has \r\nbecome a member of various regional and international \r\norganizations, with a view to integrating itself into the \r\nregional and international economic system. One of the \r\nsignificant events for the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic this year is the convening of the twenty-third \r\nministerial meeting of the International Organization of \r\nla Francophonie on 20 and 21 November 2007 in \r\nVientiane. As the host country, the Lao Government \r\nwould like to encourage all member States to \r\nparticipate and actively contribute to the success of \r\nthat meeting. \r\n To conclude, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic reaffirms its unswerving commitment to \r\ncontinue cooperating with the international community \r\nin pursuit of a peaceful, equitable and prosperous \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n11 07-52293 \r\n \r\nworld, free of fear and want, in order to ensure the \r\nwell-being of all peoples on the basis of respect for the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law, as well as the recognition of diversity \r\nand respect for the social, cultural and historic reality \r\nof each country. To that end, greater efforts and \r\nsacrifices are definitely required from us all. Yet I am \r\nsure that together we will be able to make it happen. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Tavau Teii, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Natural Resources of Tuvalu. \r\n Mr. Teii (Tuvalu): Today has a very special \r\nmeaning for us: twenty-nine years ago, under the \r\nblessings of this body, Tuvalu was granted its \r\nindependence. I am honoured, therefore, to speak on \r\nbehalf of the people and Government of Tuvalu and to \r\nconvey to this session of the United Nations General \r\nAssembly our warmest greetings.  \r\n At the outset, Tuvalu wishes to associate itself \r\nwith previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Kerim in \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. We also wish to take this \r\nopportunity to welcome and congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Ban Ki-moon, on his appointment as head of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n As we celebrate our twenty-ninth anniversary of \r\nindependence, let me convey our most sincere thanks \r\nand gratitude to the international community, \r\nespecially to our traditional development partners, \r\nclose friends and international and regional \r\norganizations for their support and cooperation over \r\nthe past years. We are confident that such gestures of \r\nunderstanding, friendship and cooperation will \r\ncontinue in the years ahead. Our endeavours to achieve \r\nexcellence have been guided by the United Nations \r\nprinciples of good governance, respect for the rule of \r\nlaw and for human rights, democracy and self-\r\ndetermination. Our future survival as a nation is \r\nfounded on these basic ideals of the United Nations.  \r\n Tuvalu welcomes the key priority issues of \r\nclimate change, financing for development, achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, countering \r\nterrorism, and the United Nations reform agenda, \r\nwhich the President has clearly identified and \r\nhighlighted in his opening address at the sixty-second \r\nsession. We would like, however, to focus on five main \r\nissues: the United Nations reforms, the United Nations \r\npresence in Pacific small island developing States, the \r\nquestion of Taiwan’s membership in the United \r\nNations and its agencies, criteria for least developed \r\ncountries graduation, and responding to climate \r\nchange. \r\n On the United Nations reforms, we acknowledge \r\nwith sincerity the tremendous efforts that the \r\nOrganization has made in fulfilling its purpose, based \r\non its noble pillars of development: peace and security \r\nand human rights, as enshrined under its Charter. \r\nThrough such efforts, the United Nations has reached \r\nout to many countries of the world in providing the \r\nrequired services for those who need them most. \r\nHowever, these efforts always encounter many \r\nchallenges that can be resolved only if the United \r\nNations membership and all its subsidiary bodies \r\ncommit to work together in harmony and with respect \r\nfor each other. \r\n The need for the United Nations to ensure \r\nefficiency, effectiveness and transparency in carrying \r\nout its mandates and all its related programmes cannot \r\nbe overemphasized. In this connection, Tuvalu \r\nwelcomes and supports the ongoing work on United \r\nNations reform. In particular, Tuvalu supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s report in response to the \r\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on United \r\nNations System-wide Coherence and agrees that the \r\nUnited Nations system must be more results-oriented, \r\nefficient and accountable. \r\n Tuvalu fully supports the ongoing reform work of \r\nthe United Nations that promotes country-driven \r\nprogrammes. However, we are very disappointed with \r\nthe unjustifiably slow progress in establishing the \r\nUnited Nations presence in the remaining Pacific small \r\nisland developing States that do not have United \r\nNations offices. As a full Member of the United \r\nNations, we feel that Tuvalu and other small island \r\ndeveloping States from the Pacific each deserve to \r\nhave a United Nations office established in-country, \r\nwhich will be instrumental in the coordination and \r\nimplementation of United Nations projects and \r\nprogrammes on the ground. Our isolation and \r\ngeographical fragmentation in itself is justification for \r\nestablishing a joint United Nations office in Tuvalu. \r\nWe appeal to the United Nations for the earliest \r\nimplementation of this long overdue commitment.  \r\n Tuvalu highly commends the momentum of the \r\nwork on the reform of the Security Council, especially \r\nthe excellent work done by the Open-ended Working \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 12 \r\n \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security \r\nCouncil. Tuvalu warmly welcomes the next step of \r\nsubmitting the issue for further intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations as a way forward. Tuvalu further supports \r\nthe draft resolution tabled by India for the same \r\npurpose in addressing this very important task. \r\n However, we are very disturbed with the \r\ncontinuance of finger-pointing and undiplomatic \r\nlanguage being directed at small island developing \r\nStates for their contributions to the Security Council \r\nreform process. As a small peace-loving nation and a \r\nfull Member of the United Nations, Tuvalu has the \r\nsovereign right to support any issue that will benefit \r\nthe achievement of the United Nations goals. We \r\nstrongly believe that open dialogue and working \r\ntogether in mutual understanding under the framework \r\nof the United Nations is the only way to reach our \r\nshared destiny in diversity and to respect one another.  \r\n Tuvalu firmly believes that the paramount \r\nmission of the United Nations must remain the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security while ensuring the \r\nuniversal participation of all nations of the world, as \r\nclearly articulated in the Preamble to the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\n However, the United Nations cannot be said to be \r\nuniversal nor can global peace and security be assured \r\nuntil the issue of Taiwan’s membership and \r\nparticipation in the United Nations is properly \r\nresolved. It is disappointing to note that this body does \r\nnot even want to at least put Taiwan’s membership \r\napplication on its agenda for proper consideration. \r\n Let me reaffirm Tuvalu’s strong support for \r\nTaiwan’s membership application to the United \r\nNations. We feel that this issue is long overdue and \r\nneeds to be considered more seriously and purely on its \r\nown merits.  \r\n Taiwan has shown international responsibility \r\nand has helped many countries in the world — \r\nincluding my own country, Tuvalu — with \r\ndevelopment assistance. It is our strong opinion that \r\nTaiwan is a country with a clearly defined territory and \r\nan established democratic system of government and is \r\na responsible international player in world trade, \r\ndevelopment and diplomatic relations. The rights and \r\nself-determination of the Taiwanese people to join the \r\nUnited Nations should be urgently addressed. Taiwan \r\nhas all of the capabilities needed to fulfil its \r\nobligations as a peace-loving State and become a full \r\nMember of the United Nations as required under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.  \r\n Despite all this, it is sad to note that the United \r\nNations has continued to turn a blind eye to the wishes \r\nand needs of the people of Taiwan, who simply want to \r\nbe part of the international family and participate \r\nactively in the attainment of the noble pillars of \r\ndevelopment, security and human rights. More sadly, \r\nthe action taken by the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations in not complying with the requirements of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the rules of \r\nprocedure of the Security Council is disappointing. \r\nTuvalu further appeals for the proper and urgent \r\nconsideration of Taiwan’s membership application to \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n The issue of graduating from the least developed \r\ncountries (LDC) category has caused great anxiety for \r\nTuvalu. As recognized in the Mauritius strategy for \r\nsmall island developing States, it is most alarming that \r\nall the potential candidates for graduation from the \r\nLDC list are Pacific small island developing States, \r\ndespite our special disadvantages and environmental \r\nvulnerabilities. We appeal to this Assembly, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and our development \r\npartners to carefully reconsider the criteria for LDC \r\ngraduation and their application, taking into account \r\nthe special disadvantages of small island developing \r\nStates. \r\n The President’s leadership in choosing \r\n“Responding to Climate Change” as the theme of this \r\nsession is highly commendable. Likewise, Tuvalu \r\napplauds the leadership of the Secretary-General on \r\nclimate change. We are pleased that world leaders at \r\nthe High-level Event on Climate Change have agreed \r\non the urgency of addressing climate change in a \r\ncomprehensive way. We believe we are now ready to \r\nmake a historic agreement in Bali to start negotiations \r\non a new climate change agreement.  \r\n As the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, Mr. Apisai \r\nIelemia, clearly stated in the June issue of the United \r\nNations Chronicle magazine, “If there is one issue that \r\nstrikes at the heart of my nation, Tuvalu, it is climate \r\nchange.” Climate change is undoubtedly an issue of \r\nextreme importance to a small, atoll nation like Tuvalu. \r\nThe recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \r\nClimate Change highlights the extreme vulnerability of \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n13 07-52293 \r\n \r\nisland countries like Tuvalu to the impacts of climate \r\nchange and the urgent necessity for global action to \r\naddress this vulnerability. In this context the coming \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nBali will be very important.  \r\n In our view, the Conference in Bali should have \r\nthe following components: First, it should reconfirm \r\nthe important role of the Kyoto Protocol and encourage \r\nparties to the Protocol to pledge new and substantial \r\nemissions reductions and encourage others to become a \r\nparty to it.  \r\n Secondly, we should agree to amend the Kyoto \r\nProtocol so that we open the door for newly \r\nindustrialized countries, countries with economies in \r\ntransition and any other interested countries, including \r\ndeveloping countries, to take on commitments to \r\nreduce their greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n Thirdly, we must commit to a new global \r\nframework on adaptation to the impacts of climate \r\nchange. For highly vulnerable countries like Tuvalu \r\nthis is an essential step in the process. \r\n Lastly, we must agree on a new negotiation \r\nprocess under the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change that will establish a \r\nnew legal agreement to allow developing countries to \r\nmake voluntary commitments to reduce their \r\nemissions. Under this agreement we envisage that \r\ndeveloping countries will be able to make voluntary \r\ncommitments to reduce emissions from the energy, \r\ntransport and forestry sectors. These commitments \r\nwould be linked to appropriate incentive mechanisms.  \r\n In the context of reducing emissions from \r\ndeforestation we believe that any agreed measures \r\nmust bring about real reductions in global emissions. \r\nActions to reduce emissions from deforestation should \r\nnot undermine or devalue efforts to reduce emissions \r\nfrom other sectors. Furthermore, these actions should \r\nnot infringe upon the rights of indigenous peoples and \r\nlocal communities. The causes of deforestation are \r\ncomplex, particularly as there are serious governance \r\nissues to resolve. Let us make sure to get a durable \r\nsolution to this issue that will achieve a lasting climate \r\nchange outcome.  \r\n There are a number of elements that we think are \r\nessential in a new global framework on adaptation. We \r\nelaborated some of these during the High-Level Event \r\non Climate Change. Let me highlight two: First, we \r\nmust establish a whole new source of funding for \r\nadaptation and a new approach on how adaptation \r\nfunding is managed. A potential new source of funding \r\nfor adaptation could come from a tax levied on \r\ninternational aviation and maritime transport. \r\nSecondly, we must establish a global insurance facility \r\nto help assist vulnerable countries recover from the \r\nimpacts of climate change.  \r\n We must seize the opportunity at Bali. We must \r\nset ourselves a short timeframe to create a new legally \r\nbinding agreement on climate change. This should not \r\nundermine the Kyoto Protocol but should build on its \r\nstrengths. Those countries that have turned their backs \r\non the Kyoto Protocol must now take part in the global \r\neffort and commit to reducing their emissions within a \r\ntight timeframe. Once this is done, then we will see the \r\nrest of the world move forward, for it is crucial that all \r\ncountries must make an effort to reduce their \r\nemissions. We must not waste the opportunity at Bali.  \r\n In conclusion, my Government encourages all \r\ncountries to support the reform agenda for the United \r\nNations including the serious consideration of self-\r\ndetermination and the universal participation of all \r\nnations. We strongly encourage all Governments to use \r\nthe next climate change Conference of the Parties in \r\nBali to be a starting point for new negotiations on \r\nclimate change. The future of Tuvalu and lives of many \r\nothers like us is at stake. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Andrei Stratan, Deputy Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and European Integration \r\nof the Republic of Moldova.  \r\n Mr. Stratan (Moldova): I would like, first of all, \r\nto join the speakers who have already addressed this \r\nAssembly in congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session.  \r\n It also gives me great pleasure to welcome the \r\nappointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General \r\nand to acknowledge the distinct manner in which he \r\nhas started his activities, as well as his tireless efforts \r\nto breathe a new dynamism into the United Nations \r\nwith the purpose of optimizing its functioning. \r\n The present session is especially meaningful for \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, marking the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of its having joined the United Nations \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 14 \r\n \r\nfamily. As a State Member of the United Nations, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova has demonstrated faithfulness to \r\nthe principles and purposes of the United Nations \r\nCharter by totally supporting the objectives of the \r\nOrganization and sharing its responsibilities. \r\n The globalization process is occurring \r\neverywhere and is of concern to all of us. As members \r\nknow, those issues are addressed in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). In our opinion, the \r\npresent level of aid is not sufficient; the identification \r\nof innovative sources of financing and an increase in \r\nthe effectiveness of existing aid are imperative. In that \r\nvein, we hope that the recommendations in the areas of \r\ndevelopment contained in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-level Panel on United Nations System-\r\nwide Coherence (A/61/583) will help us overcome the \r\nfragmentation of the United Nations so that the system \r\ncan deliver as one, in partnership with all Member \r\nStates. \r\n The high-level event organized under the \r\nauspices of the Secretary-General that preceded the \r\ngeneral debates drew attention to climate change, \r\nwhose fatal effects have been experienced all over the \r\nworld. We know about that very well as, this summer, \r\nour country suffered the worst drought in 60 years. We \r\nhighly appreciate the United Nations institutions, first \r\nand foremost the Food and Agriculture Organization of \r\nthe United Nations and the World Food Programme, \r\nand all Member States which immediately answered \r\nour request for help. We continue to count on such aid \r\nin mitigating the consequences of the drought. \r\n Under these circumstances, we favour the \r\nadoption of a new international agreement in this area, \r\nand we hope that the next session of the Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change will be able to \r\nnegotiate new arrangements for moving beyond the \r\nKyoto Protocol. \r\n Terrorism remains a major threat to the internal \r\nsecurity of countries and to international security. In \r\nthat regard, the Republic of Moldova wholeheartedly \r\nsupports United Nations efforts in fighting terrorism. \r\nOne example of this is our joining the International \r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear \r\nTerrorism. Internally, the Government has undertaken a \r\nseries of concrete actions towards fighting terrorism by \r\nadopting its national strategy for preventing and \r\nfighting money-laundering and terrorism financing, as \r\nwell as by implementing relevant resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n We see in the present session of the General \r\nAssembly an opportunity to finalize the draft of a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\naimed at reaching an international consensus on a \r\nnormative framework in that area. Heightened attention \r\nmust be given to the fight against terrorism nourished \r\nby separatist tendencies that affect the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States. I wish to assure members \r\nthat our delegation will participate actively in \r\ncoordinating the negotiating process in the Sixth \r\nCommittee of the General Assembly.  \r\n The United Nations has represented for decades \r\nthe proper forum for tackling varied problems related \r\nto disarmament and non-proliferation. The Republic of \r\nMoldova welcomes the new approach to controlling \r\nsmall arms and light weapons and in that context we \r\nare in favour of a new agreement in the area of arms \r\nsales. We support the international community’s efforts \r\naimed at establishing an efficient security system and \r\narms control system and remain a faithful supporter of \r\nimplementing the Treaty on Conventional Armed \r\nForces in Europe (CFE).  \r\n I wish to reiterate on this occasion the position of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova that the withdrawal of the \r\nRussian troops that remain on Moldovan territory \r\nagainst our will, in conformity with the obligations \r\nassumed by the Russian Federation in 1999 in Istanbul, \r\nwould create the necessary conditions for ratifying and \r\napplying the adapted CFE Treaty. \r\n The Transdniestrian conflict remains a continuous \r\nobstacle to promoting reforms and ensuring the social \r\nand economic development of our country. A year ago, \r\nspeaking in the Assembly, we addressed in great detail \r\nthe problems related to the conflict and expressed hope \r\nfor a final sustainable solution. Today, I have to state \r\nregretfully that the negotiations process — suspended \r\nsince April 2006 because of the rigid and non-\r\nconstructive position of separatist leaders supported \r\nfrom outside Moldova — could not be restarted, in \r\nspite of our constant efforts. That serves as a screen for \r\npromoting some political and mafia interests foreign to \r\nthe people of the region. Continuous violations of \r\nfundamental human rights in the Transdniestrian region \r\nand the inefficiency of the existing peacekeeping \r\nmechanism make imperative the need to transform that \r\nmechanism into a multinational civil mission with an \r\ninternational mandate. \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n15 07-52293 \r\n \r\n In the context of United Nations consolidation, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova supports the adoption of \r\ndecisions necessary for the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, reform of the Security Council and \r\nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. \r\nIn that respect, we consider that the Security Council \r\nneeds to be extended in both permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories, as a result of which the Eastern \r\nEuropean Group would be offered an additional  \r\nnon-permanent seat. \r\n We welcome the adoption of resolution 61/16, on \r\nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nthe major body for coordinating the economic and \r\nsocial activities of the United Nations. The Republic of \r\nMoldova presented its candidature for the current \r\nyear’s elections to the Economic and Social Council, \r\nand I take this opportunity to thank all the Member \r\nStates that granted us their trust. \r\n The Republic of Moldova has constantly \r\nsupported the maintenance and consolidation of the \r\nOrganization’s role in resolving crisis and conflict \r\nsituations, aiding in post-conflict construction and \r\nproviding humanitarian assistance to affected zones in \r\nvarious parts of the world, especially to the zones \r\naffected by conflicts, including the GUAM region. In \r\nthat respect, we welcome the decision of the General \r\nAssembly to maintain in the agenda of the current \r\nsession item 16, entitled “Protracted conflicts in the \r\nGUAM area and their implications for international \r\npeace, security and development”, and the increased \r\nattention it is paying to the issue. \r\n I would like in conclusion to reaffirm the will of \r\nthe State I represent to cooperate in and actively \r\ncontribute to the common efforts of Member States to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations as the Organization that \r\nholds the key role in peacekeeping, security and \r\nsustainable development. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Minister Sayyid Badr Bin \r\nHamad AlBusaidi, Secretary General of the Foreign \r\nMinistry of the Sultanate of Oman. \r\n Mr. AlBusaidi (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, it gives me pleasure to extend to the President \r\nand his friendly country, the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, my country’s warmest congratulations \r\non Mr. Kerim’s assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are \r\nconfident that his vast diplomatic experience will help \r\nus to achieve desired objectives and will steer the \r\nAssembly to a successful conclusion. Let me also pay \r\ntribute to his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Al-Khalifa, \r\nfrom the sisterly Kingdom of Bahrain, for the optimal \r\nmanner in which she so ably and wisely conducted the \r\nwork of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment as \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. We are \r\nconfident that he will render valuable services to this \r\nOrganization, with his vast experience in both political \r\nand diplomatic fields. I assure him of my delegation’s \r\nreadiness to offer all the necessary assistance to help \r\nhim discharge his responsibilities. We wish him every \r\nsuccess. I would like also to commend Mr. Kofi Annan \r\nfor all the efforts he made to promote the work of this \r\nOrganization during his tenure as Secretary-General. \r\n The annual session of the General Assembly \r\nprovides us with the opportunity to address various \r\nregional and international issues and to express our \r\nconcerns and interests. I would like to point out here \r\nthat the efforts exerted by the United Nations have \r\nhelped us to understand the process of addressing many \r\ninternational problems, including the important \r\nquestion of the Middle East. \r\n Despite the fact that efforts made to address the \r\nsituations in Palestine, Iraq, Darfur, Somalia and other \r\nareas have so far failed to provide conclusive solutions, \r\nthey are nevertheless positive indications demonstrating \r\nthe willingness and determination of the international \r\ncommunity to shoulder its responsibilities in order to end \r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of establishing a \r\nPalestinian State living in peace side by side with the \r\nState of Israel. \r\n The withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian \r\nterritories occupied since 1967, the establishment of \r\nthe State of Palestine and the withdrawal of Israel from \r\nthe Syrian Golan Heights and Lebanese Shaba’a farms \r\nwill promote security and stability in the Middle East \r\nregion. This will encourage the development of \r\ncooperation among the countries and peoples of the \r\nregion. We sense that there are positive trends and new \r\nconvictions among Israeli political leaders, and in \r\nIsraeli society at large, on the need to reach a peaceful \r\nsolution based on the relevant resolutions of the United \r\nNations, in order to put an end to decades of conflict in \r\nthe Middle East region. \r\n It is necessary to point out here that Arab States \r\nhave on many occasions stressed their conviction that \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 16 \r\n \r\nthe achievement of a just and equitable peace with \r\nIsrael depends on the withdrawal of Israel to the \r\nborders of 1967. Establishing such a peace is the Arab \r\nStates’ strategic choice. \r\n We call upon the international community, \r\nespecially the major Powers, to promote this positive \r\nconviction within Israel and the Arab States in the \r\ninterest of achieving peace. \r\n Iraqi blood continues to be spilled. We believe \r\nthat the extension of the new responsibilities of the \r\nUnited Nations in Iraq, in accordance with Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1770 (2007), is a positive step that \r\ncommands our full support. In this respect, we urge our \r\nbrothers in Iraq, especially the Iraqi Government, to \r\nmove from a stage of discord to a stage of problem-\r\nsolving in the national interest of Iraq. \r\n We are optimistic about the sincere efforts \r\nexerted by the Sudanese Government and the African \r\nUnion to reach a political settlement among the various \r\nSudanese parties in Darfur. We support the tripartite \r\nagreement signed by that Government, the United \r\nNations and the African Union, on providing support to \r\nAfrican forces and on deploying more troops in Darfur \r\nto restore security and achieve success in the \r\nnegotiations between the Sudanese Government and \r\nthe opposition groups in Darfur. \r\n Somalia is still suffering the consequences of a \r\ncivil war that has claimed the lives of thousands of \r\npeople and displaced hundreds of thousands more. We \r\nbelieve that accord among the different Somali factions \r\nis the only way out. We also believe that the \r\ninternational community has a major responsibility to \r\nhelp Somalia restore its unity and security. To \r\nguarantee the effectiveness of the assistance given by \r\nthe international community, we urge all tribes and \r\nfactions in Somalia to be decisive and to help those \r\nwho are trying to help them. \r\n We have always welcomed the continued \r\ncooperation between the friendly Islamic Republic of \r\nIran and the International Atomic and Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA). There are hopes and opportunities that augur \r\nwell for a peaceful solution guaranteeing the right of \r\nIran to benefit from peaceful nuclear technology and \r\nassuages the concerns of the international community.  \r\n We as human beings are all partners on this \r\nplanet and we have to work together to build it and \r\ndevelop and preserve its resources. Therefore, it is \r\nimportant for the international community to observe \r\nthe extraordinary weather conditions such as \r\nhurricanes, floods and the erosion and loss of arable \r\nland that are taking place in different continents. These \r\nphenomena have inflicted human and economic losses, \r\ndisplaced hundreds of thousands of people from their \r\nhomes and have damaged the necessary sources of \r\nhealth and livelihood, in addition to other essential \r\nservices.  \r\n In this context, we commend the vital role played \r\nby the United Nations and recognize its efforts in \r\norganizing the High-level Event on Climate Change \r\nthat was held on 24 September. We also urge the \r\ninternational community to develop specific measures \r\nand identify steps and solutions to face these \r\nchallenges. \r\n More than ever before, the international \r\ncommunity is called upon to commission \r\nenvironmental and scientific studies to face the dangers \r\nposed by such phenomena, in order to maintain \r\necological balance and diversity, which both are \r\nnecessary if life is to continue on this planet. Hence, \r\nwe must harness the new technological and electronic \r\ndevelopments in order to combat pollution and \r\npreserve the environment and biological diversity. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome and are pleased to be among \r\nthe many States that have endorsed the special \r\ninitiative on the Millennium Development Goals with \r\nregard to the call for action that was adopted recently. \r\n We also welcome the convening of the high-level \r\ndialogue on cooperation between religions and \r\ncultures, scheduled to be held during this session in \r\nOctober. We hope that the meeting will succeed in \r\nadopting a futuristic view that focuses on the positive \r\naspects, based on understanding between religions and \r\ncultures. Such understanding must be based on mutual \r\nrespect for all religious beliefs and cultures. \r\n In closing, we wish this session every success and \r\nwe hope that we may be able to leave it with a vision \r\nthat defines the road for the future in the service of \r\nmankind with renewed commitments among Member \r\nStates to United Nations resolutions and to respect for \r\nthe provisions of the Charter. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Walid Al-Moualem, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic. \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n17 07-52293 \r\n \r\n Mr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session and to wish him \r\nevery success in his important task. Allow me also to \r\nsalute his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed  \r\nAl-Khalifa of sisterly Bahrain and to express our \r\nappreciation of the efforts she deployed to bring the \r\nwork of that session to a successful conclusion. \r\n I also wish to express to the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, our best wishes for success \r\nin his noble mission, namely, that of guiding our \r\ninternational Organization towards the realization of \r\nthe purposes and principles of its Charter. \r\n The Middle East region has been an arena of \r\ndaunting challenges and heightened tensions owing to \r\nthe Israeli occupation, since 1967, of Arab territories \r\nand to the denial of the legitimate national rights of the \r\nPalestinian people. Although this is not a new \r\ndevelopment, recent challenges and tensions have been \r\nescalating and, as such, they not only threaten security \r\nand stability throughout the region, but also \r\ninternational peace and security. The hopes of the \r\npeoples of the region of achieving a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace and living in a secure and stable \r\nenvironment have faded, if they have not totally died. \r\nMoreover, the current situation in Iraq and the \r\nattendant anger and apprehensions it has generated \r\nhave turned the region into an explosive hotbed of \r\ntensions and a theatre of confrontations, instead of \r\nallowing it to prosper, pursue its development goals \r\nand achieve progress. \r\n May I, therefore, ask what have we accomplished \r\nover the past year or during the previous session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in terms of addressing the root \r\ncauses of tensions plaguing the Middle East region? \r\nThat situation does not serve the interests of any of the \r\nparties, inside or outside the region. The prevailing \r\ntrends have not changed: Israeli occupation of Arab \r\nlands continues, so does the denial of the legitimate \r\nrights of Palestinians. One can even say that the \r\nsupport, financing and arming of those policies have \r\ncontinued unabated and have even surpassed previous \r\nrecords. The recently reported figures on the increased \r\nUnited States arming of Israel speak for themselves. \r\n The latest act of aggression against Syria on \r\n6 September 2007 is proof of Israel’s desire to escalate \r\ntensions. We reiterate that the failure of the \r\ninternational community, including the Security \r\nCouncil, to condemn that act of aggression will \r\nencourage Israel to persist in that hostile pursuit, and \r\nwill lead to the exacerbation of tensions in the region. \r\nSome sources in the United States have spread rumours \r\nand fabricated news in order to justify that act of \r\naggression. By distorting the facts they have become \r\nIsrael’s accomplices in that act. \r\n Addressing and pursuing peace in the Middle \r\nEast require first and foremost evincing the will to \r\nmake peace on the basis of law and justice. \r\nRegrettably, that will does not factor into the priorities \r\nof some of the policies pursued nowadays. The \r\ncontemplated substance, approach and objectives of an \r\ninternational gathering that seeks to find a \r\ncomprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\nremain vague. Furthermore, the proposed gathering \r\nfails to identify the purpose, basis, terms of reference \r\nand time frame of the process. \r\n Syria has repeatedly stressed and stresses again \r\ntoday that peace is its strategic choice. President \r\nBashar Al-Assad highlighted that fact in the statement \r\nhe made before the People’s Assembly on 17 July \r\n2007. He stated that Syria is ready for a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace built on resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy, which he deemed to be the \r\nprelude to the realization of peace and security in the \r\nregion. The statement confirms that Syria has the will \r\nto make a genuine peace that would recover the rights \r\nand return the land to its rightful owners and that \r\nwould guarantee peace for all. We have repeatedly \r\ncalled for a resumption of the peace process on the \r\nbasis of the Madrid terms of reference and the principle \r\nof land for peace. Let me ask here: does the Israeli \r\nGovernment or the current American administration \r\nstill have that will, the will to make genuine peace? \r\nRegrettably, actions and realities on the ground suggest \r\notherwise. \r\n The current situation in Iraq presages great \r\ndangers for Iraq and the region. Addressing that \r\nsituation requires effective cooperation among all \r\nparties inside Iraq, in the region and the world at large. \r\nThe absence of a genuine political vision for a solution \r\nand the exclusive reliance on a military solution further \r\naggravate the situation. We have always stressed the \r\nneed to preserve the unity of the Iraqi people and the \r\nIraqi land, the non-interference in its internal affairs, \r\nthe preservation of its sovereignty and independence, \r\nits Arab and Islamic identity and the rejection of any \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 18 \r\n \r\nclaims to divide it. We believe that the solution in Iraq \r\nmust begin with national reconciliation based on the \r\nprinciple of respect for the will of all segments of the \r\nIraqi people to determine their political future or to lay \r\nthe foundation for a new Iraq that is built on equal \r\ncitizenship. We therefore stress the need for the \r\nwithdrawal of all foreign forces from Iraq, in \r\nagreement with the Iraqi Government, because that \r\nmeasure will contribute to curbing the violence. We \r\nhave repeatedly stressed our condemnation of all \r\nterrorist acts committed in Iraq that claim the lives of \r\ninnocent civilians. Occasional allegations that \r\ncombatants are infiltrating into Iraq through the \r\nSyrian-Iraqi border cannot be farther from the truth. \r\nThey fail to acknowledge the strict measures that Syria \r\nhas put in place to control those borders. We believe \r\nthat the purpose of those unfounded accusations is to \r\nassign to others the responsibility for the failure of the \r\noccupying Power to achieve security and stability in \r\nIraq. \r\n The deteriorating security situation in Iraq has \r\nprompted many Iraqis to flee their country. There are \r\nover 1.6 million Iraqi refugees in Syria today. In \r\naddition to the security and social repercussions \r\nassociated with their presence, Syria is bearing an \r\nenormous financial burden to satisfy their economic \r\nneeds and to provide them with services. It is \r\nregrettable that the international community has failed \r\nto discharge its responsibility to assist Iraqi refugees \r\nuntil it becomes safe for them to return to their homes \r\nand country. The occupying Power spends hundreds of \r\nbillions of dollars on military operations inside Iraq, \r\nbut fails to allocate any resources to assist Iraqis who \r\nhave been forced out of Iraq as a result of the \r\noccupation and its repercussions. \r\n Official visits exchanged between fraternal Iraq \r\nand Syria have opened broad horizons for mutual \r\ncooperation and have identified the main areas of \r\ncooperation at all levels. Syria, for its part, plans to \r\nimplement all the measures agreed to during those \r\nvisits. \r\n The critical and sensitive situation in brotherly \r\nLebanon requires that the Lebanese act together in \r\norder to emerge from the current state of affairs and \r\narrive at solutions that will serve the interest of \r\nLebanon and its future. Syria has consistently \r\nsupported all initiatives aimed at activating Lebanese \r\ndialogue within the country with a view to arriving at a \r\nconsensus. We believe that the run-up to the coming \r\npresidential elections constitutes a good basis for \r\nconsensus-building among the Lebanese to elect a \r\npresident in accordance with constitutional rules, free \r\nfrom foreign intervention and in a manner that would \r\nsafeguard Lebanon’s interests and its relations with \r\nArab countries. \r\n Syria reaffirms its position calling for the \r\nelimination of all weapons of mass destruction from \r\nthe Middle East region. Allow me to recall that in 2003 \r\nSyria tabled a draft resolution before the Security \r\nCouncil on behalf of the Arab Group, and we are still \r\nlooking forward to its adoption. \r\n I would like to affirm that Syria associates itself \r\nwith the declared positions of other developing \r\ncountries, which stress the freedom and the right of all \r\ncountries to acquire nuclear technologies to use them \r\nfor peaceful purposes. We believe that it is necessary to \r\ncompel Israel, the sole party in the region that \r\npossesses nuclear weapons, to submit its facilities to \r\nthe safeguards regime of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) and to adhere to the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive \r\nSafeguards Agreement. \r\n Like many others, I wonder whether the world \r\nhas become safer many years after the beginning of the \r\nwar on terrorism. The answer is common knowledge. \r\nTerrorism has spread to areas that have never known \r\nthat phenomenon before. Syria believes that fighting \r\nterrorism by force alone is useless. We must address \r\nthe root causes of terrorism and firmly distinguish \r\nbetween combating terrorism and the legitimate right \r\nof people to resist foreign occupation. We call on all \r\nStates to cooperate in the fight against terrorism. At the \r\nsame time, we warn against using terrorism as a pretext \r\nto compromise peoples’ rights and to instil hatred \r\namong religions and civilizations instead of promoting \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogues in the interest \r\nof humanity at large. \r\n Earlier on in the debate we listened to calls \r\nadvocating interference in the internal affairs of States \r\nunder the pretext of defending human rights and \r\npromoting democracy. Syria questions the discrepancy \r\nbetween words and actions in Palestine, Iraq, Lebanon \r\nand other parts of the world. The inhumane practices \r\nwe learned of in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and the \r\ncondoning of Israeli aggression against Lebanon last \r\nyear and other Israeli practices in Palestine and the \r\nGolan constitute grave violations of human rights. That \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n19 07-52293 \r\n \r\nprompts us to question in turn, and rightly so: which \r\nhuman rights are they advocating? \r\n More than ever before our world needs a \r\nreaffirmation of our commitment to the principles and \r\npurposes of the United Nations, in order to avoid \r\napplying double standards and to free the Organization \r\nfrom those few who try to control its decisions and \r\ndictate their policies to its organs. The conflicts and \r\ncrises with which our world is plagued today must \r\nprompt us to seek solutions based on enhanced \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogues, and to \r\npersevere in our pursuit of the political solutions to \r\ncurrent international problems in a manner that would \r\npreserve international peace and security. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nyamaa Enkhbold, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Mongolia.  \r\n Mr. Enkhbold (Mongolia): We are at the middle \r\nof the road, halfway towards the 2015 deadline for \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. Eight \r\nyears are left — is that much? Are we keeping the \r\npace? Measured against the history of the human race \r\nit is but a sand particle in an hourglass. But measured \r\nagainst the hopes and expectations of millions of \r\npeople living in abject poverty with no access to clean \r\nwater, for children with little prospect of gaining an \r\neducation and reaching their full potential in life, for \r\nwomen dying in childbirth, for infants who will never \r\nlearn how to walk or talk or read and write, who are \r\ntaken away by preventable diseases — that surely \r\namounts to much more than a sand particle. \r\n By 2015 our peoples will judge whether the \r\npledges and commitments made by their leaders and \r\nthe international community as a whole were genuine. \r\nThey shall ascertain whether the conferences and \r\nillustrious gatherings of the world leaders stand for \r\nactual deeds or whether they simply equal empty words \r\nand hollow promises. The eight years towards 2015 are \r\nthus a litmus test of our credibility. To pass the test or \r\nnot is, therefore, upon us. We must deliver what we \r\npledged. We must achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and other internationally \r\nagreed development goals. We must exert our best \r\nefforts individually as nations and we must exert them \r\ncollectively as the international community. \r\n In order to do this, we must now look back at our \r\nindividual progress so far. We must take stock of what \r\nhas already been achieved and what is yet to be done to \r\nachieve the Goals on time. My country, Mongolia, is \r\nintimately monitoring its own progress on the path \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs. The second national \r\nreport on MDG implementation in Mongolia has only \r\nrecently been considered by the national Government. \r\n Implementation of the MDGs is about meeting \r\nthe basic needs of the people and securing their social \r\nand personal welfare, and my Government is very \r\nserious about delivering them for our people. \r\nUnfortunately, despite the considerable efforts made, \r\nsuccess is still far from assured on a number of goals \r\nand, first and foremost, on the goal to halve poverty. \r\n On a global scale, the MDG progress report of \r\n2007 revealed the same mixed picture. The report made \r\na strong case for concerted additional action to be \r\ntaken immediately and sustained until 2015 if the \r\nworld is to attain the MDGs. It argued that the lack of \r\nany significant increase in official development \r\nassistance since 2004 makes it impossible, even for \r\nwell-governed countries, to meet the MDGs. \r\n Against that backdrop, I lend my full backing and \r\nsupport to the proposal of the President of the General \r\nAssembly to have an MDG leaders’ meeting here at the \r\nUnited Nations. Such a meeting must, in our view, not \r\nonly serve as a midterm review mechanism, but also \r\ncoin concrete proposals and recommendations on the \r\nway forward. \r\n We are fully aware of our primary responsibility \r\nfor our own development, yet there are factors well \r\nbeyond our control that impede progress, and climate \r\nchange figures prominently among them. Climate \r\nchange is definitely no longer a subject of pure \r\nscientific and academic discourse. Nations large and \r\nsmall, coastal and landlocked alike, are feeling its \r\neffects on their economies and the livelihoods of their \r\npeoples. The recent report of the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change indicated that poor countries \r\nwill be the hardest hit by climate change, in spite of the \r\nfact that they contribute the least to the phenomenon. Is \r\nthat fair? \r\n The contribution of my country to global \r\nwarming is negligible at best, yet Mongolia is severely \r\naffected by the negative consequences of climate \r\nchange. To give but a few examples, over the past 60 \r\nyears the average temperature in Mongolia has risen by \r\nalmost 2°C, compared to a rise in the global mean \r\ntemperature of about 1°C over the last century. Some \r\n80 per cent of the land surface has been degraded, \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 20 \r\n \r\nmostly by wind erosion combined with human \r\nactivities, including mining and overgrazing by \r\nlivestock. Desertification is rampant. Pastures that \r\nsupport the semi-nomadic lifestyle of Mongols have \r\ndecreased and become more fragile. Over the past 40 \r\nyears, soil fertility has decreased by a factor of two to \r\nthree. The country has been subject to the ever-more \r\nfrequent occurrence of natural disasters, such as \r\ndrought and dzud — cold winters with heavy  \r\nsnowfalls — in recent years, which have had a severe \r\nimpact on the pastoral economy of the country. \r\n Fair or not, no country can stand aside or afford \r\ninaction in the face of such truly global challenges like \r\nclimate change. We all must carry our share of the \r\ncommon endeavour, yet it is only natural that those \r\nwho contribute the most to global warming bear the \r\nbulk of the burden. Hence, the industrialized countries \r\nshould fulfil their commitments to taking the lead in \r\nreducing their greenhouse gas emissions and to \r\nproviding financial resources and transferring clean \r\ntechnologies to developing countries. \r\n The comprehensive implementation of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\n(UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol remains a priority \r\neven as the international community embarks on the \r\nroad towards shaping the post-Kyoto framework. The \r\npost-Kyoto framework should be flexible and diverse, \r\ntaking into consideration circumstances in each \r\ncountry. It must include all the major emitters and \r\nachieve compatibility between environmental \r\nprotection and economic growth by utilizing advances \r\nin technologies to the greatest extent possible. \r\n The United Nations Climate Change Conference \r\nto be held in Bali in December will have a crucial role \r\nin shaping such a future framework. We must seize the \r\nopportunity and fully utilize the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to build the groundwork for the Bali \r\nConference. \r\n Regional and subregional mechanisms should \r\nalso be mobilized as complementary and \r\nsupplementary instruments to global efforts. Mongolia, \r\na North-East Asian country, attaches particular \r\nimportance to developing environmental cooperation \r\nmechanisms in the subregion, as dust and sand storms \r\noriginating in the expanding Gobi desert have become \r\na familiar phenomenon for inhabitants of Beijing, \r\nSeoul, Tokyo and beyond. \r\n North-East Asia is one of the most dynamic and \r\ndiverse regions of the world. It contains some of the \r\nworld’s major economic powerhouses, such as China, \r\nJapan, the Republic of Korea and the Russian \r\nFederation, along with the smaller and more vulnerable \r\neconomies of Mongolia and the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. The subregion is also home to a \r\nquarter of the world’s population. The sheer size and \r\ndiversity of the subregion mean that climate change \r\nmanifestations are wide-ranging, yet intimately felt in \r\neach and every country. \r\n Mongolia has therefore come up with an initiative \r\nto hold a North-East Asian summit on climate change \r\nin the nearest future. We hope that such a high-level \r\nevent will achieve a breakthrough in regional \r\ncooperation on climate change and serve as a tangible \r\ncontribution to global efforts. \r\n Nationally, Mongolia has been making \r\ncontinuous efforts to address the challenges posed by \r\nclimate change by appropriately improving its legal \r\nenvironment and actively implementing various \r\nprogrammes and projects. In 1996, a national action \r\nplan to combat desertification was adopted. In 1999, \r\nwe established a national climate change committee \r\nentrusted with formulating national policy on \r\nadaptation to climate change and reduction of \r\ngreenhouse gases, preparing reports on national \r\ngreenhouse gas inventories, policies and measures. In \r\n2000, the Government of Mongolia launched its \r\nnational action programme on climate change aimed \r\nnot only at meeting UNFCCC obligations, but also at \r\nsetting priorities for action and integrating climate \r\nchange concerns into other national and sectoral \r\ndevelopment plans and programmes. \r\n Furthermore, our MDG-based national \r\ndevelopment strategy, the draft of which was recently \r\nsubmitted to Parliament for its consideration and \r\napproval, contains a separate chapter on environmental \r\npolicy. It identifies the protection of nature and the \r\nenvironment, the reasonable use of natural resources, \r\nand climate change concerns among national priority \r\ngoals. The draft strategy is expected to be approved by \r\nParliament this autumn. \r\n On a more practical side, in 2005 my Government \r\nlaunched a major programme on agroforestry \r\ndevelopment, entitled Green Belt, in an attempt to \r\ncombat desertification, stop sand movement, and  \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n21 07-52293 \r\n \r\nreduce dust and sand storms. Upon its completion, a \r\ngreat green wall will extend for 2,500 kilometres from \r\nthe East to the West of the country, shielding the \r\nsteppes from the Gobi desert. \r\n In the energy sector, which is mostly based on \r\nfossil fuels, particularly coal, the Government is \r\nmaking continued efforts to introduce an alternative or \r\nrenewable source of energy. To that effect, the \r\nconstruction of hydro-power plants has started, along \r\nwith the implementation of the 100,000 Solar Ger \r\nprogramme. \r\n The landlocked geographical situation of my \r\ncountry is an additional hurdle for our development \r\nefforts and MDG implementation. Indeed, our lack of \r\nterritorial access to the sea, remoteness from world \r\nmarkets, and subsequent high transportation costs and \r\nundue delays are major impediments to the trade of \r\nlandlocked developing countries. Higher trade costs \r\nreduce a country’s welfare and inhibit economic \r\ngrowth by making imports expensive and exports \r\nuncompetitive. \r\n Hence, Mongolia, together with other like-\r\nminded countries, has endeavoured to raise the \r\nawareness of the international community of the need \r\nfor support and assistance for land-locked developing \r\ncountries and to promote the common position and \r\ninterests of the group at both the United Nations and \r\nthe World Trade Organization. Here, I wish to highlight \r\nthe importance of the meeting of trade ministers of \r\nland-locked developing countries and the thematic \r\nmeeting of land-locked developing countries and their \r\ntransit neighbours on trade and trade facilitation issues, \r\nheld last month in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of \r\nMongolia, for setting the priorities of the group in the \r\ncontext of the Doha Round of multilateral trade \r\nnegotiations and in the lead-up to the midterm review \r\nof the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n Security concerns continue to affect global \r\ndevelopment. Despite our best efforts, the world \r\naround us is still not a safe place for many. Millions \r\nsuffer on a daily basis from hunger, illness, insecurity \r\nand the threat of violence. Thousands and thousands \r\nperish in sectarian violence, terrorist attacks and \r\ninternal conflicts, with thousands more having fled \r\nviolence, thus augmenting the growing ranks of \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons. All this \r\ninvariably takes a heavy toll on the development \r\naspirations of the affected countries. \r\n Many of us come from countries not ravaged by \r\nconflicts or from regions that lie thousands of miles \r\nfrom conflict zones, yet, in this age of globalization, \r\nnone of us remains unaffected. Record-setting oil \r\nprices triggered by the situation in the Middle East \r\nhave a profound impact on the world economy. Small, \r\nvulnerable and commodity-dependent economies, such \r\nas that of Mongolia, are hit hardest, along with other \r\noil-importing developing countries. However, it is \r\nordinary people in the Middle East who bear the brunt \r\nof the suffering. The international community must \r\ndeliver a promise of peace and security to the peoples \r\nof Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Darfur and other conflict \r\nzones. \r\n We must continue our global fight against \r\nterrorism, with the United Nations at the helm of that \r\ncollective effort. The recent hostage crisis in \r\nAfghanistan came as a sobering reminder of the threat \r\nstill posed by the Taliban. It proved once again that \r\nterrorists prey on those who cannot fight back. Thus, it \r\nis our solemn duty to offer protection to those who \r\ncannot defend themselves. \r\n Mongolia, a country with internationally \r\nrecognized nuclear-weapon-free status, is pleased with \r\nthe progress achieved in the six-party talks on the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the latest \r\nround of which took place last week in Beijing. As its \r\ncontribution to advancing the six-party talks, on 4 and \r\n5 September Mongolia hosted a bilateral working \r\ngroup session on the normalization of relations \r\nbetween Japan and the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea this year, and stands ready to continue such \r\nefforts in the future. \r\n Mongolia is heartened at the news about the \r\nforthcoming inter-Korean summit meeting, to start \r\ntomorrow. We are hopeful that it will contribute to the \r\ncause of bringing about peace, security, and eventually \r\na peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. In \r\nlight of the promising political dynamics in the \r\nsubregion, Mongolia is optimistic that its early call for \r\na multilateral security cooperation mechanism in \r\nNorth-East Asia will gain support in the subregion and \r\nbeyond. \r\n With scores of countries having embarked in \r\nrecent decades on a path towards establishing modern \r\nand functioning democratic societies built upon the \r\nprinciples of pluralism, respect for human rights, \r\nfreedom of the press and democratic governance, \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 22 \r\n \r\ndemocracy has been firmly established as a truly \r\nuniversal value. \r\n We in Mongolia believe that democracy is the \r\nbest possible environment for sustained economic \r\ngrowth. Democracy and respect for human rights have \r\nbeen, in our view, inherently woven into the MDGs. \r\nProceeding from that premise, in 2005 Mongolia was \r\nthe first country to adopt a ninth MDG on \r\nstrengthening human rights and fostering democratic \r\ngovernance. \r\n We are proud of its successful democratic \r\ntransition, with major gains in the political, economic, \r\nsocial and spiritual areas of our societal life. Yet, as a \r\nyoung democracy, my country is also intimately aware \r\nof the complex challenges faced by countries in \r\ntransition. We believe in international cooperation and \r\nsupport for democratization efforts. In that regard, \r\nMongolia applauds the increased role of the United \r\nNations in fostering democracy and good governance, \r\nnot only through assistance in holding credible \r\nelections, but through a wide range of activities to \r\npromote democratic institutions and practices. The \r\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund, which has already \r\nfunded over 100 projects around the globe, is a notable \r\nexample. The United Nations has also been an \r\nimportant stakeholder in the success of the new or \r\nrestored democracies process. \r\n Global challenges require global approaches, and \r\nno other body is better equipped to serve as the \r\nsteering house of the collective efforts of the \r\ninternational community than the United Nations. The \r\nUnited Nations is the world’s most universal, \r\nlegitimate and authoritative organization. It is a true \r\npolitical centre of global cooperation. It gives us \r\nlegitimacy. It gives us legality. \r\n Our world Organization has embarked on a \r\nprocess of reform in order to better respond to the \r\nmultifaceted challenges, both existing and emerging, in \r\nthis era of rapid globalization and its ensuing growing \r\ncomplexities. Progress has been made in several reform \r\nareas, yet greater efforts, combined with stronger \r\npolitical will, are needed to follow through with \r\nreforms related especially to the system-wide \r\ncoherence of the United Nations and the Security \r\nCouncil. Mongolia has full confidence in Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and supports his efforts aimed at \r\nimproving the management, efficiency and internal \r\ncohesion of the United Nations system. \r\n Our success as a community of nations in \r\ntackling the challenges of climate change, achieving \r\nthe MDGs and other internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, countering terrorism, preventing \r\nconflicts, promoting democracy and human rights, and \r\neffectively addressing other pressing issues of today \r\nlargely depends on the success of that transformation. \r\n The clock is ticking. We cannot afford to pursue \r\nbusiness as usual. If we are to honour, in good faith \r\nand on time, the pledges and commitments we made to \r\nour peoples, we must redouble our concerted efforts to \r\nwin this historic race. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Aïchatou Mindaoudou, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and African \r\nIntegration of the Niger. \r\n Mrs. Mindaoudou (Niger) (spoke in French): \r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Kerim most \r\nwarmly on his outstanding election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We \r\nare convinced that his professional qualities and his \r\nvast and rich academic, diplomatic and business \r\nexperience will lead to the success of our work. I \r\ntherefore assure him of my delegation’s fullest support \r\nin the discharge of his mandate. \r\n With respect to outgoing President Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, I wish to express our great \r\nsatisfaction at her dynamic and skilful handling of the \r\nwork of the previous session. \r\n As to the Secretary-General, I take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate the Niger Government’s \r\nadmiration and encouragement on his assumption of \r\nthe leadership of our collective Organization. \r\n Two years after the 2005 World Summit, which \r\ngave our leaders an opportunity to address the \r\nchallenges and threats confronting humankind, we \r\ncannot help feeling optimistic — despite the \r\npersistence of such scourges as international terrorism \r\nor the slow progress towards fulfilling the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals — as we consider the unflagging \r\nwillingness of the international community resolutely \r\nto seek solutions consonant with the threats that have \r\nbeen identified. \r\n In the field of international peace and security, \r\none element of the significant developments in certain \r\nparts of the world is, without a doubt, the positive \r\nimpact of the Peacebuilding Commission, in particular \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n23 07-52293 \r\n \r\nin Burundi and Sierra Leone. That alone makes the \r\ncreation of that new body worthwhile. In Africa, such \r\npositive and encouraging trends can be witnessed in \r\nthe hope raised by developments in certain conflict \r\nareas.  \r\n In West Africa, Liberia continues to move ahead \r\nwith national reconstruction and consolidation of \r\npeace.  \r\n In Côte d’Ivoire, the peace process has shown \r\ngreat promise since the Ouagadougou agreement was \r\nsigned in March 2007 and a “flame of peace” \r\nceremony took place. Those two major events bear \r\nwitness to the parties’ will to put a permanent end to \r\nthe crisis that exploded in that country five years ago.  \r\n Sierra Leone, for the first time, and after a long \r\nperiod of instability, has organized free and transparent \r\nlegislative and presidential elections, bearing witness \r\nto the resolve of the suffering people of that country to \r\nmove beyond tragedy and to resolutely build a bright \r\nfuture.  \r\n In Central Africa, the adoption by the Great \r\nLakes countries of the Pact on Security, Stability and \r\nDevelopment leads us to expect, in the medium term, a \r\nmeaningful improvement in the troubled situation that \r\nhas prevailed there for some years now. It is \r\nencouraging to note that Burundi is already at the point \r\nwhere it can do without the international community’s \r\nsupervision in peacekeeping efforts within its borders \r\nand to devote itself fully to the task of economic and \r\nsocial development.  \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is another \r\ncase in which we will allow ourselves to have great \r\nhopes if all the parties join in the peace movement and \r\ntake part in the ongoing democratic process.  \r\n In Darfur, the situation remains worrisome to be \r\nsure, but thanks to the agreement between the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the United Nations and \r\nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 \r\n(2007) on 31 July, we hope that there will soon be a \r\nreturn to peace and security in that part of the Sudan.  \r\n In Western Sahara, we are gratified by the \r\ninitiation of direct negotiations between Morocco and \r\nthe POLISARIO Front, including the two meetings \r\nheld under the aegis of the Personal Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General subsequent to the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1754 (2007).  \r\n Finally, with regard to Somalia, we earnestly \r\nhope that the national reconciliation conference and the \r\nefforts of the international community will yield \r\npositive results and enable that brother country to \r\nemerge forever from the crisis that has prevailed there \r\nfor years. \r\n The situation in the Middle East, dominated by \r\nthe Israel-Palestine conflict, requires more focused \r\nattention by the international community. My \r\ndelegation feels that the resumption of the political \r\nprocess remains the only way to move towards a just \r\nand lasting solution, on the basis of the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions and the principle of two viable \r\nStates living side by side in peace and security. The \r\nQuartet Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative remain \r\nframes of reference in this regard.  \r\n Generally speaking, the coherent subregional \r\napproach employed by the United Nations and the \r\nsubregional organizations seems well suited to \r\nhandling conflicts, and also to responding to other \r\nconcerns, such as international migration, trafficking in \r\nhuman beings, trafficking in drugs, transnational crime \r\nand the proliferation and spread of small arms and light \r\nweapons. From this perspective, in particular as \r\nregards the African continent, the capacity of \r\nsubregional organizations and the African Union \r\nshould be reinforced.  \r\n The United Nations Ten-year Capacity-Building \r\nProgramme for the African Union is to be commended, \r\nas it opens new possibilities for conflict prevention and \r\nthe maintenance of lasting peace on the continent, in \r\nparticular through the creation of an African \r\nintervention force. Along these lines, the open debates \r\nof the Security Council on strengthening the role of the \r\nCouncil in conflict prevention and resolution, in \r\nparticular in Africa, are of great importance.  \r\n Conflicts are not the only threats to international \r\npeace and security. Other phenomena, sometimes more \r\ndevastating and unforeseeable, threaten the ability of \r\npeoples around the world to enjoy their legitimate right \r\nto peace and security. Those phenomena include \r\ninternational terrorism, transnational crime and all \r\ntypes of trafficking.  \r\n In this connection, the Sahara, a geographical \r\nzone that the Niger shares with several other African \r\ncountries, is becoming a den of drug and arms \r\ntraffickers, fuelling and perpetuating insecurity in the \r\nregion. The Niger intends to participate intensively in \r\nany effort to enhance the international community’s \r\nefforts to eradicate that scourge, which undermines the \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 24 \r\n \r\neconomies of the countries concerned and threatens the \r\nfoundations of democracy.  \r\n In that regard, my delegation considers \r\ninternational cooperation and assistance for affected \r\ndeveloping countries to be indispensable if we are to \r\nsucceed in combating drug trafficking and trafficking \r\nin small arms and light weapons, including anti-tank \r\nand anti-personnel mines. These are used by armed \r\ngroups to continue to inflict untold suffering on \r\ninnocent civilians, obstruct trade and hinder all \r\ndevelopment activities in infested areas. The scope and \r\ngravity of the phenomenon truly require that the \r\ninternational community give it all due attention and \r\nfirmly condemn the criminal acts being carried out by \r\nthese networks of traffickers, in particular in our \r\nregion. \r\n The linkage between peace, security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights, spelled out in the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), has lost \r\nnone of its relevance and continues to fuel our \r\nthinking. That is why the Niger continues to feel a \r\nsense of solidarity for all initiatives, present or future, \r\ndesigned to give new momentum to development \r\nefforts.  \r\n Niger welcomes the initiative of the informal \r\nthematic debate entitled “Partnerships towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals: Taking \r\nstock, moving forward”, held on 27 November 2006 \r\nand the first in a series of three debates organized by \r\nthe General Assembly in the context of its \r\nrevitalization process. On that occasion, some \r\ndevelopment partners were able to undertake concrete \r\ncommitments, such as that of the Islamic Development \r\nBank, which announced the creation of a poverty \r\nmitigation fund endowed with a $10 billion budget. \r\nThe Government of the Niger, through me, would like \r\nto commend that exemplary initiative, which is part of \r\nan ever more effective development partnership.  \r\n The Niger sees the General Assembly’s adoption \r\nof resolution of 61/16 on strengthening the role of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council as a great step forward. \r\nThe resolution names the Economic and Social Council \r\nas a principal body responsible for economic and social \r\ndevelopment and, in particular, for the implementation \r\nof the international development goals agreed at the \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n We congratulate the State of Qatar on having \r\nhosted the preparatory meeting for the Monterrey \r\nConsensus review conference, to be held in Doha in \r\n2008. Moreover, the unparalleled commitment of the \r\nGovernment of Qatar to international development led \r\nit to host the Conference on Consolidating Food \r\nSecurity in Niger, which was held in Doha with the \r\nsupport of the Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\nand proved most successful. I therefore take this \r\nprivileged moment at the rostrum of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session to reiterate the \r\nprofound gratitude of the people and Government of \r\nthe Niger to that friendly country, the entire Islamic \r\nummah and all other partners who kindly supported \r\nthat initiative. \r\n The international community should pay \r\nparticular attention to one category of countries that is \r\neven more vulnerable. I am referring to land-locked \r\ndeveloping countries, whose geography puts them at a \r\ngreat disadvantage. In 2003, the Almaty Conference, \r\nhaving considered their situation, adopted a \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, the \r\nimplementation of which is soon to be reviewed. The \r\ntime has therefore come to launch an urgent appeal to \r\nall development partners to resolve to take the \r\nnecessary measures not only to help those countries to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, but also \r\nto enable them to mitigate the negative impacts of \r\ndesertification, environmental degradation and climate \r\nchange.  \r\n Desertification and the deteriorating environment \r\nare two problems that seriously affect the countries of \r\nthe Sahel, including mine. The combined efforts of the \r\ninternational community effectively to combat those \r\nscourges should be stepped up. The action taken by the \r\nNiger, based on the experience gained through the \r\nspecial programme launched by the President of the \r\nRepublic, has allowed us to achieve spectacular \r\nsuccesses that deserve to be consolidated and \r\nstrengthened. \r\n Thanks to the work to restore degraded soil, \r\nremove sand and reforest the landscape undertaken \r\nover the past few years and stepped up in the \r\nframework of that programme, 3 million hectares have \r\nbeen reclaimed from the desert, according to satellite \r\nmonitoring undertaken in 2006 and transmitted by the \r\nregional Agrimet centre. Large expanses that were \r\ndesperately arid have now become productive  \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n25 07-52293 \r\n \r\nagricultural areas and pasture land thanks to water-\r\nretention and infiltration activities that have raised the \r\nwater table. It is worth noting that such activities are \r\nbeing carried out by several thousand young people \r\nbeing paid through a cash-for-work programme.  \r\n The public debate in the Security Council and the \r\nthematic debate in the General Assembly dedicated to \r\nclimate change highlighted the scope and gravity of the \r\nphenomenon by emphasizing the need for urgent \r\ncollective action. The eloquent statements made at the \r\nhigh-level meeting organized by the Secretary-General \r\non 24 September lead us to believe that the parties are \r\nwilling to move to achieve essential objectives, which \r\nis the only way to secure a wholesome and reliable \r\nenvironment for present and future generations. The \r\nNiger resolutely supports that momentum and, within \r\nits national strategy and plan of action for climate \r\nchange and viability, has drafted a national programme \r\nof action for adaptation to climate change. \r\n All such questions, which fall within the context \r\nof a comprehensive vision of sustainable development, \r\nare covered in our revised poverty reduction strategy, \r\nwhich is the reference framework for my country’s \r\noverall economic and development policy. I take this \r\nexceptional opportunity solemnly to invite all our \r\ndevelopment partners to participate in the international \r\nconference on the Niger’s revised poverty reduction \r\nstrategy, to be held in Brussels in October. The \r\nconference has been called, inter alia, to harmonize and \r\ncoordinate the contributions of our development \r\npartners. \r\n Harmonization and coordination are topical \r\nissues in the United Nations. They are essential to \r\nincreasing the Organization’s effectiveness in \r\ncollective action to address global challenges and \r\nthreats. My delegation agrees that system-wide \r\ncoherence in United Nations activities should be a \r\nprincipal focus for the implementation of reforms \r\nadvocated in the Outcome Document of the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. We must therefore find the means to \r\nimplement them. I note that we see such reforms as a \r\nway of better helping developing countries to achieve \r\nlasting economic growth, develop sustainably and \r\neradicate poverty.  \r\n That is the vision that leads me to reaffirm the \r\nNiger’s conviction that coherence and coordination \r\nmust be inspired by the cardinal principles of \r\nownership, national leadership and respect for national \r\ndevelopment priorities. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Rita Kieber-Beck, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Liechtenstein. \r\n Mrs. Kieber-Beck (Liechtenstein): Climate \r\nchange, at the centre of the high-level event a week \r\nago, constitutes one of the greatest challenges of our \r\ngeneration. It puts to the test our ability to create the \r\ncollective political will necessary to counter a \r\nphenomenon of potentially disastrous socio-economic \r\nconsequences. It also offers a great opportunity to \r\nmake the best use of the unique framework that this \r\nOrganization provides. The Bali meeting must bring \r\nabout a long-term commitment by all States to \r\nlaunching an ambitious and practical road map towards \r\na gradually decarbonized global economy. We can \r\nreach that goal if we translate today’s political \r\nmomentum into concrete action that goes beyond \r\ntomorrow’s activities.  \r\n Climate change is but one of the areas of concern \r\nto the international community, where it is absolutely \r\nclear that the United Nations is today more than ever \r\nan indispensable Organization. It appears indeed that \r\nits unique nature and potential are more widely \r\nrecognized and accepted today than they were until \r\neven very recently. In the words of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon, the pendulum is swinging back in our \r\nfavour. As a strong believer in multilateralism, we \r\nwelcome that development. \r\n However, as true friends of the United Nations, \r\nwe must also continue to question the ability of the \r\nOrganization to fully use its potential and to fulfil the \r\npurposes and principles of its Charter. Our record in \r\nthe area of reform, two years after the 2005 World \r\nSummit, is mixed. We yet have to achieve certain \r\ninstitutional reforms, and the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect must be translated into \r\nconcrete action, such as in the case of the oppressive \r\npolicies of the regime in Myanmar against its own \r\npopulation. Of course, however, reform of an \r\norganization with tasks as diverse and daunting as the \r\nUnited Nations is never concluded. We must always be \r\nprepared to make the adjustments that are necessary to \r\nimprove its impact, its legitimacy and its efficiency. \r\nToday, such adjustments require a two-fold approach. \r\nOn the one hand, we must strengthen its operational \r\nparts and, on the other hand, we must ground the work \r\nof the Organization more firmly in its origins, namely, \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 26 \r\n \r\n The demands in the area of peacekeeping are \r\ngreater than ever before. That attests to the faith placed \r\nin the United Nations, but it also makes the \r\ndeficiencies in the management of the Organization a \r\nmore pressing issue. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nwas therefore right to propose changes to strengthen \r\ninstitutional support for the Organization’s field \r\nactivities. We look forward to further progress in that \r\nrespect, in particular in the area of procurement. We \r\nare not convinced that the lessons from the oil-for-food \r\nscandal, which has done great damage to the United \r\nNations, have been fully absorbed, let alone fully \r\ntranslated into concrete action. We must also credibly \r\nimprove the financial efficiency and accountability of \r\nthe Organization. That will, in turn, allow us to present \r\nto our domestic constituencies the ever-increasing bills \r\nfor peacekeeping operations. \r\n All the strengthening of the operational and \r\nmanagerial capabilities of the United Nations will not \r\nchange the fact that, operationally and financially, this \r\nis not a powerful Organization. Its budget will always \r\npale in comparison to what a number of States spend \r\non their defence budgets, to cite an obvious example. \r\nThe genuine power and strength of the Organization \r\nlies in its foundation in international law. The Charter \r\nitself can be regarded as the greatest achievement in \r\nthe history of international law. More important, \r\nthough, the United Nations has the unique ability to \r\nbestow legitimacy and legality on international action. \r\nIn the eyes of the world, the United Nations \r\nsymbolizes the rule of law in international relations.  \r\n That is a tremendous asset that we must cherish \r\nand promote wherever possible. The United Nations \r\nand its organs must always be seen as the guardians of \r\ninternational law. Given its central place in the \r\ninstitutional architecture of the Organization, that \r\napplies in particular to the Security Council. The \r\ncurrent practice of the Council with respect to the \r\nlisting and de-listing of individuals targeted by \r\nsanctions is therefore a cause for concern. We believe \r\nthat disregarding international standards of due process \r\ndoes nothing to improve the effectiveness of sanctions \r\nregimes, but much to undermine the authority of the \r\nCouncil itself. \r\n Long years and much energy have been spent on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council. It would appear \r\ntoday that we are as far from a solution as ever. We \r\nbelieve that the legitimacy of the Council’s actions has \r\na number of sources, the most important of which are \r\nthe quality of its decisions and the extent to which they \r\nreflect international law. In addition, the decisions of \r\nthe Council have the necessary legitimacy if they are \r\ngenuinely taken on behalf of the membership as a \r\nwhole, and therefore also on behalf of the vast majority \r\nof States that do not serve on the Council. That can be \r\nachieved through greater involvement by non-member \r\nStates, in particular if and when their interests are \r\ndirectly affected. Finally, of course, the membership of \r\nthe Council must be more representative of the overall \r\nmembership of the Organization, and of the developing \r\nworld in particular. \r\n The past few years have not brought about the era \r\nof the rule of law that some had hoped for. Quite to the \r\ncontrary, there have been concerted, and ultimately \r\nunsuccessful, attacks on the importance of the rule of \r\nlaw in international relations. Nevertheless, we have \r\nachieved very significant progress in some areas, in \r\nparticular in the area of international criminal justice. \r\nThe Security Council has led the way through the \r\nestablishment of international and hybrid tribunals. But \r\nthe crowning success, of course, was the establishment \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC).  \r\n The referral of the situation in Darfur to the Court \r\nwas a landmark decision, both legally and politically. It \r\nwas a strong message by the Security Council that the \r\ninternational community does not accept impunity for \r\nthe most serious crimes under international law. That \r\nmessage, however, needs to be backed up by \r\nenforcement action, in particular by the arrest of all \r\nindictees sought by the Court. We therefore call on all \r\nStates and the United Nations to cooperate with the \r\nICC to that end. \r\n We will continue to take great interest in the work \r\nof the Security Council. At the same time, of course, \r\nwe will focus our energy on making the General \r\nAssembly a more relevant and more essential part of \r\nthe United Nations system. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation looks forward to the President’s leadership \r\nand to closely cooperating with him on the priority \r\nissues he has identified. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Karel de Gucht, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Belgium. \r\n Mr. De Gucht (Belgium) (spoke in French): We \r\nlive in an increasingly complex world of ever more \r\ndiverse challenges. Actions taken in isolation are no \r\nlonger enough. Given such complexity, the United \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n27 07-52293 \r\n \r\nNations should not only be a bulwark against arbitrary \r\nactions in international relations but also, above all, the \r\nvehicle for effective responses. I am pleased to note \r\nthat there is growing consensus on this issue. \r\n Climate change was the topic of a recent high-\r\nlevel event. A Security Council summit meeting has \r\njust addressed the situation in Africa. In addition to \r\npeace and international security, the United Nations \r\nmust also tackle a wide array of issues. The fight \r\nagainst terrorism, pandemics, human rights, \r\ndisarmament, migration and the environment are \r\nexamples of the diverse subjects requiring a \r\nmultilateral approach. \r\n Multilateralism has been reinvigorated, especially \r\nin the areas of peacekeeping and security. The current \r\n18 peacekeeping missions and the 100,000 Blue \r\nHelmets now in the field clearly attest to that. Belgium \r\nhas witnessed that evolution up close since becoming a \r\nmember of the Security Council at the beginning of \r\n2007. We shall continue to strengthen multilateralism \r\nin that body. \r\n In Africa, working through the United Nations, \r\nthe international community has been actively engaged \r\nin the search for solutions to the issues of Darfur, \r\nChad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Congo and Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n The efforts of the United Nations Organization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\n(MONUC) have been crucial to re-establishing peace \r\nand setting up democratic institutions in that country. \r\nNow is not the time to scale back our efforts. The \r\ntenuous situation in the eastern part of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the resumption of fighting \r\nin North Kivu pose serious risks to the process of \r\nstabilizing the country. They also have tragic \r\nhumanitarian consequences. Moreover, the scourge of \r\nthe recruitment of child soldiers takes on new \r\nproportions. As pointed out by the Secretary-General, \r\nwe urgently need a global solution, including a \r\nregional dimension that will allow us to make better \r\nuse of MONUC’s input. While the Congolese \r\nauthorities are preparing for local elections, which will \r\nstrengthen democratic culture across the country, they \r\nneed our full support. Belgium will continue to \r\nmobilize the attention of the international community \r\non this important matter. \r\n In Sudan, it is imperative that we make progress \r\nin our search for a political solution for Darfur. I \r\nencourage all parties to take advantage of the Tripoli \r\nconference in order to identify the elements of the \r\nconflict, such as the distribution of resources and \r\npower-sharing, and to establish the foundation for a \r\nlasting settlement. We need to speed up the deployment \r\nof the peacekeeping force, with the full cooperation of \r\nthe Sudanese Government. Moreover, we will have to \r\ncontinue to consolidate reconciliation between north \r\nand south of the country. \r\n Furthermore, the role of regional organizations in \r\nmanaging crises has significantly increased over the \r\npast year. The African Union has invested its efforts, \r\nboth in Somalia and in Darfur, where new ways of \r\ncooperation with the United Nations are developing. \r\nThe hybrid force is an example of this new form of \r\ncooperation.  \r\n As for the European Union, it has supported \r\nMONUC’s efforts in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. It will also contribute to curbing the \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Chad and in the Central African \r\nRepublic by sending a military force to support the \r\nUnited Nations missions in the region. Belgium will \r\nparticipate in this effort. The European Union has also \r\ndeveloped a close cooperation with the African Union \r\nby supporting its efforts in crisis management, while \r\npaying close attention to the strengthening of its \r\neffectiveness. On the whole, we welcome this regional \r\ninput and the increasing synergies among the United \r\nNations, the African Union and the European Union. \r\n Regarding Kosovo, it is, on the other hand, \r\nregrettable that the Security Council was unable last \r\nJune to assume its responsibility on a matter for which \r\nthe solution is essential for peace and stability in \r\nEurope. I urge both parties to seize this present \r\nopportunity to come to a compromise. This is a matter \r\nof urgency. The status quo is not an option, as we are \r\nall aware. Absent an agreement between the parties, \r\nEurope will then have to shoulder its responsibilities. \r\n In the Middle East, the international community \r\nhas mobilized in order to contribute to a solution to the \r\ncrisis in Lebanon. By extending for one year the \r\nmandate of the United Nations Interim Force in \r\nLebanon (UNIFIL), in which Belgium participates with \r\nclose to 400 troops, it has recognized UNIFIL’s role in \r\nthe solution of the crisis.  \r\n But the current political stalemate is alarming. All \r\nparties should demonstrate a sense of responsibility. \r\nThe institutions should be allowed to function normally \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 28 \r\n \r\nagain, beginning with the election of the president in \r\naccordance with the constitutional process, in the \r\nassigned timetable and without foreign interference. \r\nThe latest attack that claimed the lives of member of \r\nParliament Antoine Ghanem and nine other people \r\nshows how impunity threatens the stability of the \r\ncountry. The establishment of the Special Tribunal for \r\nLebanon is clear evidence of the support that the \r\nmultilateral system is willing to provide to the fight \r\nagainst this impunity. \r\n In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, neither the \r\ncontinuation of firing rockets at the Israeli population, \r\nnor the deterioration of the living conditions of \r\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip, is acceptable. Regular \r\nmeetings between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders \r\nconstitute an encouraging development after so many \r\nyears of misunderstanding and lack of true dialogue. I \r\nhope that these steps will be bear fruit at the \r\ninternational meeting slated for before the end of this \r\nyear. Belgium actively supports any progress in the \r\npeace process. \r\n The Security Council has recently reinforced the \r\nmandate of the United Nations in Iraq. The United \r\nNations can, in fact, play an important role in \r\nhumanitarian emergency matters, in regional \r\ncooperation and in national reconciliation. But its \r\naction will depend on the security conditions and will \r\nhave to be able to rely truly on the support of the \r\ninternational community, the Iraqi Government and the \r\nneighbouring countries, as expressed at the \r\n22 September meeting. \r\n In dealing with the nuclear issue in Iran, Belgium \r\nhas, from the outset, supported a multilateral approach. \r\nWe have to resolutely use the multilateral mechanisms \r\nsuch as the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) and the Security Council, in order to obtain \r\ntangible results. In the past, Iran has not fulfilled its \r\nobligations regarding the transparency of its nuclear \r\nactivities. In order to restore confidence and to make \r\nthe best use of the objective verification capacities of \r\nthe IAEA, Iran will have to fully respect the \r\nregulations of the Comprehensive Safeguards \r\nAgreement and the Additional Protocol. However, the \r\nmeasures prescribed in Security Council resolutions go \r\nbeyond those regulations and aim at creating the \r\nconditions for restoring international confidence in the \r\nIranian nuclear programme. Complete and immediate \r\ncompliance with these resolutions by Iran is a \r\ncondition to resume the dialogue that had to be \r\ninterrupted in 2005. The credibility of the Security \r\nCouncil is also at stake. \r\n In Asia, the mission of good offices of the \r\nSecretary-General has made it possible for us to follow \r\nclosely the situation in Myanmar. The latest \r\ndemonstrations show the determination of the \r\npopulation and should finally incite the Government to \r\ninitiate an inclusive dialogue with a view to restoring \r\ndemocracy in Myanmar. Use of violence will not be \r\ntolerated. \r\n Beyond crisis resolution, progress has also been \r\nmade in the area of peacebuilding. The international \r\ncommunity must remain vigilant. The cost of leaving a \r\ncountry too quickly is always higher than investing in \r\npeacebuilding. The true success of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will be judged by the long-term stability \r\nof the countries currently on its agenda, namely, \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone. \r\n The recent adoption of concrete recommendations \r\nfollowing the deterioration of the political situation in \r\nBurundi illustrates its increasing capacity to react \r\nquickly to events that could jeopardize the stabilization \r\nof the countries with which it is dealing. In Burundi, \r\nthe dialogue must definitely be pursued in order to \r\nsolve the political stalemate, which impedes the normal \r\nfunctioning of the State’s institutions. Every effort \r\nmust be made in order to bring the Forces nationales de \r\nlibération (FNL) back to constructive negotiations with \r\nthe Government as soon as possible. \r\n Three of the most recent and expensive \r\npeacekeeping operations have been deployed in \r\ncountries where conflicts were fuelled by the illegal \r\nexploitation of natural resources, namely, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra \r\nLeone. That clearly illustrates the urgent need to \r\ndevelop mechanisms that break the link between the \r\nillegal exploitation of natural resources and conflict.  \r\n This issue was the central theme of our \r\npresidency of the Security Council last June. We \r\nidentified several courses of action. For example, we \r\nmust reinforce the capacity of the Secretariat to deal \r\nwith such issues; define more precisely, as necessary, \r\nthe mandates of peacekeeping operations; cause the \r\nsanctions committees to operate in a more targeted \r\nmanner; and consolidate the methods of the work of \r\nexperts groups. In the coming months, it is our \r\nintention to pursue our efforts in these areas, which \r\nrelate to both security and development. We hope that \r\nwe can rely on the support of Member States. \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n29 07-52293 \r\n \r\n Our attention to crisis management and \r\npeacebuilding must not diminish the importance that \r\nwe accord to preventive diplomacy. I welcome the \r\ninitiatives of the Secretary-General in this area, such as \r\nstrengthening United Nations mediation capacities and \r\nupgrading the mandates concerning prevention of \r\ngenocide and mass atrocities and concerning \r\nresponsibility to protect. We also have to make this \r\nconcept operational. \r\n Conflict affects civilian populations long after the \r\nend of hostilities. The prevention of conflict should not \r\noverlook human security. That is why our country is \r\nworking to promote an international instrument on \r\ncluster bombs; that is why it supports negotiations on a \r\ntreaty on arms trafficking, and that is also why we are \r\npursuing action against the recruitment and use of child \r\nsoldiers. \r\n Crisis prevention also entails development. \r\nEveryone should have the opportunity to choose his or \r\nher way in life with dignity. The alternative is \r\nfrustration that often leads only to violence. The \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the fight against \r\npoverty therefore remain a major challenge.  \r\n In this context, Belgium pays special attention to \r\ngood governance. Last March, in cooperation with the \r\nWorld Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-\r\noperation and Development, we organized in Brussels \r\nan international conference on good governance and \r\nthe fight against corruption. That conference illustrated \r\nthe potential in this area — triangular partnerships \r\namong donor countries, recipient countries and the \r\nprivate sector — which needs to be explored, including \r\nwithin the United Nations. \r\n Poverty also forces many migrants to leave their \r\ncountry, having no other choice. In July 2007, Belgium \r\norganized, in the presence of the Secretary-General, the \r\nfirst Global Forum on Migration and Development. \r\nThat was a new opportunity to demonstrate our firm \r\nmultilateral commitment. It emerged that legal \r\nmigration can be an opportunity for both the countries \r\nof origin and the countries of destination. In addition, \r\nwith good cooperation between the countries involved, \r\ndevelopment can also foster migration by choice rather \r\nthan by necessity. Belgium will contribute to the \r\nfollow-up of this initiative with the Philippines, which \r\nwill organize the second Global Forum in 2008. \r\n Human rights are one of the pillars of our \r\ncollective security. We must ensure respect for those \r\nrights under all circumstances. That is why in 2005 we \r\nemphasized the need for in-depth reform of the former \r\nCommission on Human Rights. At this stage, however, \r\nI regretfully note that the new Human Rights Council \r\ndoes not meet our expectations. An institutional \r\nagreement that was reached between the members of \r\nthe Human Rights Council in Geneva in June came at \r\nthe expense of difficult concessions. The capacity of \r\nthe Council to react promptly to human rights \r\nviolations will thus be compromised. \r\n Multilateralism is back. Nevertheless, it is only a \r\nmethod, not an end in itself, and this method can be \r\ndisappointing if it does not bring results. We therefore \r\nneed an instrument that will animate multilateralism \r\nand adapt the United Nations to the current \r\nenvironment. Achieving our common objectives \r\ndepends on developing a modern organization that is \r\nwell adapted, well equipped and well managed. We \r\nwill therefore need to consolidate the bases for a \r\nresponsible and professional Secretariat. \r\n System-wide coherence in the United Nations is \r\nalso indispensable from this standpoint. In order to \r\nfoster coherence of development activities by the \r\nUnited Nations in the field, the current reform effort \r\nhas as its main objective to reinforce its efficiency for \r\nthe benefit of developing countries. \r\n After years of discussion, it is unfortunate that we \r\nhave not been able to make progress on the \r\nindispensable reform of the Security Council. We \r\nundoubtedly need a new working method that would \r\nallow us to get the technical working group out of New \r\nYork, where it is bogged down, and to involve the \r\ncapitals and the political levels more. I therefore \r\nsuggest appointing a high-level special envoy for \r\nSecurity Council reform, who would be responsible for \r\nleading these consultations and for presenting us with a \r\nproposal. \r\n As far as I am concerned, my clear preference \r\ngoes to a formula that would consist initially of an \r\naddition of new, semi-permanent seats, without \r\nmodifying the current balance between permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members. Later on, permanent \r\nmembers would accept to give up their right of veto. \r\n The United Nations must serve the general \r\ninterest of the community of Member States, as well as \r\nof the populations they represent. The United Nations \r\nwill succeed only if those States manage to transcend \r\nthe sum of their particular interests. It is the shared \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 30 \r\n \r\nresponsibility of each of us to display the necessary \r\nvision in order to put our Organization in the service of \r\nthe common good. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, \r\nSecretary for Relations with States of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Mamberti (Holy See): \r\nMr. President, the Holy See takes this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate you on your election and looks forward to \r\nworking with you. At the same time, it is my pleasure \r\nto greet the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, and wish him well at his first full \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n Less than a year ago, the General Assembly \r\napproved the project to renovate these United Nations \r\nHeadquarters. Such material renovation seems an \r\nappropriate reminder for States of the need to be \r\nconstantly renewed in the pursuit of the great \r\nobjectives that inspired the creation of the Organization \r\nof the United Nations.  \r\n Sixty-two years ago, the United Nations was \r\nestablished in order to save future generations from the \r\nscourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human \r\nrights and in the dignity and value of the human \r\nperson, to ensure respect for international law and to \r\npromote social progress in universal freedom. Today, \r\nonce more, we must reaffirm those values in order to \r\ndeliver a forceful “no” to war and an equally forceful \r\n“yes” to human dignity. \r\n The Preamble of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, in its reference to the fundamental rights and \r\nthe dignity of the human person, uses the word “faith” \r\nand links it to dialogue and cooperation among nations. \r\nIn this way it is affirmed that there is such a thing as \r\nuniversal and transcendent truth about man and his \r\ninnate dignity, which is not only prior to all political \r\nactivity but determines it, so that no ideology of power \r\ncan eliminate it. \r\n This innate dignity also determines the just \r\nmeasure of national interests, which may never be \r\nconsidered absolute, and in defence of which not only \r\nis it never right to harm the legitimate interests of other \r\nStates, but there is an obligation at the same time to \r\nhelp promote the common good of all people. Respect \r\nfor human dignity, therefore, is the deepest ethical \r\nfoundation in the search for peace and in the building \r\nup of international relations corresponding to the \r\nauthentic needs and hopes of all the peoples of the \r\nEarth. To forget or to accept partially and selectively \r\nthat principle is what lies at the origin of conflict, \r\nenvironmental degradation and social and economic \r\ninjustice. \r\n The terrorist attacks that marked the beginning of \r\nthe twenty-first century have given rise to pessimistic \r\nvisions of humanity based on a supposed clash of \r\ncivilizations. At times, people respond by returning to \r\nextreme forms of nationalism, or by extending \r\njustification for the use of force, or by further \r\nrelativizing values essentially tied to human dignity, in \r\nparticular the universal right to life and to religious \r\nfreedom. \r\n Nowadays, the binomial “culture and religion” is \r\nincreasingly heard in this Hall. The Holy See welcomes \r\nthe initiative to hold a High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace, which will take place here on  \r\n5 October under the leadership of the General \r\nAssembly President. Indeed, dialogue among peoples \r\nof different cultures and religions is not an option; it is \r\nsomething that is indispensable for peace and for the \r\nrenewal of international life. \r\n The Holy See hopes that the increased interest on \r\nthe part of non-religious bodies and institutions will \r\ncontribute to a greater respect for religious freedom \r\neverywhere. Today, the right to religious freedom \r\ncontinues to be disregarded, and even violated, in \r\ncertain places. Such violations have become a pretext \r\nfor various other forms of discrimination. If religious \r\nleaders and believers expect States and societies to \r\nrespect them and acknowledge their religions to be true \r\ninstruments of peace, they themselves must respect \r\nreligious freedom; they must show that they pledge to \r\npromote peace and shun violence; they must \r\ndemonstrate that religion is not and must not become a \r\npretext for conflict; and they must declare without \r\nambiguity that to promote violence or to wage war in \r\nthe name of religion is a blatant contradiction. \r\n At the difficult crossroads at which humanity \r\nfinds itself today, the use of force no longer represents \r\na sustainable solution. It is important to help the \r\nConference on Disarmament find a way out of the \r\nimpasse in which it has been languishing for more than \r\na decade, to relieve the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons from the severe strain to which it \r\nhas been increasingly subjected lately, and to give new \r\n A/62/PV.12\r\n \r\n31 07-52293 \r\n \r\nimpetus to recognizing the value of the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. This year’s fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the entry into force of the Statute of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency is a most fitting \r\noccasion to reaffirm our commitment to a peaceful \r\nfuture through the non-proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons, the reduction and definitive dismantling of \r\nexisting nuclear weapons and the non-discriminatory, \r\npeaceful and safe use of nuclear technology. \r\n Moreover, this Organization must take further \r\nsteps on arms control in the field of conventional \r\nweapons, including small arms and light weapons. The \r\nHoly See associates itself with all appeals that \r\nunderline the importance of adopting a common \r\napproach aimed at combating not only illegal traffic in \r\nsuch weapons but also other connected activities, such \r\nas terrorism, organized crime and trafficking in drugs \r\nand in precious raw materials. \r\n Another important area in which the Holy See \r\nurges serious and effective action on the part of the \r\ninternational community is that of cluster munitions. A \r\nrapid response to this problem is becoming an ethical \r\nimperative because of the high cost in human life, the \r\nmajority of the victims being civilians, especially \r\nchildren. \r\n This Organization has expressed its willingness \r\nmany times to devote more resources to conflict \r\nprevention, particularly in the area of mediation. In this \r\nregard, the Holy See has a particular interest in the \r\nefforts of the Department of Political Affairs to create a \r\nstanding team of expert mediators as part of the \r\nSecretary-General’s goal to make more effective use of \r\nhis good offices for conflict prevention. While the \r\nmultiplication of peace operations could mean that \r\nthere has been a failure to prevent conflict situations \r\nfrom erupting into full-scale armed conflicts, it is also \r\na sign of the trust that the international community \r\nplaces in the mechanisms of the United Nations and in \r\ntheir cooperation with regional agencies. In this \r\ncontext, we look forward to the day that peacekeeping \r\nefforts in Darfur will finally be fully operational. \r\n I wish to recall the contribution of the United \r\nNations towards a just and final solution to the \r\nconflicts that for too long have caused bloodshed in the \r\nMiddle East. There is need for renewed commitment \r\non the part of all Member countries in the pacification \r\nand reconstruction of long-suffering Iraq, a \r\nreconstruction that is more moral and political than \r\neconomic. There is a need for renewed commitment in \r\nthe search for a solution through dialogue of the \r\nconflict between Israelis and Palestinians, one which is \r\ncapable of recognizing the legitimate expectations of \r\neach side.  \r\n Renewed commitment is needed in ensuring that \r\nLebanon will continue to be a free and independent \r\ncountry, a democratic, multicultural and multi-\r\nconfessional society, equitable and respectful of all \r\npeople and of the various trends present in its midst, \r\nlike a common home open to others. This is \r\nparticularly necessary in the present crucial period \r\nleading to an election of the new head of State. \r\n Finally, I cannot but make reference to what is \r\nhappening in Myanmar, which these days occupies the \r\nattention and concerns of the General Assembly and of \r\nthe whole international community. I wish to reiterate \r\nthe appeal made yesterday by Pope Benedict XVI: \r\nthrough dialogue, good will and a spirit of humanity, \r\nmay a solution to the crisis be found quickly for the \r\ngood of the country and a better future for all its \r\ninhabitants. \r\n The creation two years ago of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission was based upon the conviction that it is \r\nnot enough to put an end to wars, but it is also \r\nnecessary to help reconstruct individual lives and the \r\nsocial and institutional fabric. Now, the biggest test for \r\nthe international community is to give the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission the mandate and the means \r\nto prove on the ground that it can successfully manage \r\nand support the difficult transition from war and \r\nmisery to peace and development. \r\n Many of the problems that are attributed today \r\nalmost exclusively to cultural and religious differences \r\nhave their origin in economic and social injustice. \r\nFreedom from want, illness, hunger and ignorance is a \r\nnecessary precondition for a serene dialogue of \r\ncivilizations. Forty years ago, in his encyclical \r\nPopulorum Progressio, Pope Paul VI stated that \r\ndevelopment is the new name for peace. The Holy See \r\nis concerned about the inability of rich countries to \r\noffer the poorest countries, especially those in Africa, \r\nfinancial and trade conditions capable of promoting \r\ntheir sustainable development. \r\n I salute the high-level event on climate change \r\nheld here on 24 September. The Holy See wishes to \r\nunderline once again the moral imperative incumbent \r\nA/62/PV.12  \r\n \r\n07-52293 32 \r\n \r\nupon each and every one of us in safeguarding the \r\nenvironment — our fundamental common good. \r\n We are approaching the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, yet many \r\nhave never heard of it or been given the benefits of its \r\nprinciples. Those rights are not based on the mere will \r\nof human beings, or in the reality of the State or in \r\npublic powers, but rather are grounded in the objective \r\nrequirements of the nature bestowed on man. \r\n The most important part of our work in that \r\ncontext is to ensure that the right to life is respected \r\neverywhere. That fundamental right must be protected \r\nfrom conception until natural death. Therefore, we \r\nmust work to stop and reverse the culture of death \r\nembraced by some social and legal structures that try to \r\nmake the suppression of life acceptable by disguising it \r\nas a medical or social service. In that sense, the \r\nabolition of the death penalty should also be seen as a \r\nconsequence of full respect for the right to life. \r\n The legitimate quest for equality between men \r\nand women has achieved positive results. Nevertheless, \r\ninequalities in the exercise of basic human rights \r\nunfortunately still persist in many places. That leads to \r\na breakdown in the social fabric and results in women’s \r\nobjectification and exploitation. The vindication of \r\nequality needs to be accompanied by the awareness \r\nthat it goes hand in hand with and does not endanger, \r\nmuch less contradict, the recognition of both the \r\ndifference and the complementarity between men and \r\nwomen. \r\n The Holy See looks forward to the \r\ncommemorative high-level meeting on the follow-up to \r\nthe outcome of the special session on children, \r\nscheduled for 11 and 12 December 2007. It will be an  \r\nopportunity to refocus our commitments to children \r\nand to redouble our efforts to promote their rights, end \r\nviolence against them and support the family. \r\n Faith in human dignity demands that the problem \r\nof migration be approached in the context of human \r\nrights, family rights and children’s rights. While it is \r\nessential to fight human trafficking and legitimate to \r\ncurb illegal migration, no one can justify measures \r\nwhich put lives at risk or gravely offend human dignity \r\nand human rights. The Holy See welcomes the \r\nmomentum created by the first meeting of the Global \r\nForum on Migration and Development, held in \r\nBrussels in July, and looks forward to more progress in \r\nthat regard. \r\n We must continue to ensure that peace and \r\nsecurity and development and human rights are \r\neffectively combined and mutually reinforcing, in \r\norder to show the international community that the \r\nrenovation of United Nations Headquarters is not only \r\nphysical, but also a renewal of the Organization’s \r\nideals and intentions. A renewal that reaches into the \r\ndeepest corners of the Organization is one in which all \r\nnations of the world will rightly take pride. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Before proceeding \r\nfurther, I wish to draw the attention of the General \r\nAssembly to document A/INF/62/4, which contains the \r\nprogramme of work of the Assembly and schedule of \r\nplenary meetings for the period from October to \r\nDecember 2007 and which has been distributed desk to \r\ndesk. I wish to inform Members that the list of \r\nspeakers for the items listed in A/INF/62/4 are open.  \r\n The meeting rose at 1.35 p.m. \r\n"
