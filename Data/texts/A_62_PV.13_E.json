(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency The \r\nHonourable George Andre Wells, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Vanuatu. \r\n Mr. Wells (Vanuatu): I bring to this Assembly \r\nwarm greetings from the people of Vanuatu. \r\n Today is an important day in the histories of four \r\nof our Members of the United Nations family, and my \r\nGovernment and the people of Vanuatu congratulate \r\nthe people of Tuvalu, Nigeria and Cyprus on their \r\nindependence anniversaries, and the people of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China on the anniversary of the \r\nfounding of that great nation. \r\n Let me also join others in extending our \r\nfelicitations to you, Sir. You take up your high position \r\nat a time when the United Nations is confronted by \r\nsome enormous challenges. The uncertainty shrouding \r\nthe horizon will severely test our common resolve to \r\naddress global problems.  \r\n Mr. Mavroyiannis (Cyprus), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n The escalating tension and animosity in the world \r\ntoday are an affront to the principles and values of the \r\nOrganization and ultimately challenge international \r\norder. What the world needs right now is a hand of \r\nfriendship to rebuild trust and faith among and between \r\nMembers. The resounding war of words must not be \r\naccepted with complacency. \r\n As one of the smallest members of the United \r\nNations family of nations, Vanuatu would like to \r\nreaffirm its commitment to building global peace and \r\nsecurity. We will also continue to participate in United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions. \r\n May I also take this opportunity to acknowledge \r\nthe anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade some \r\n200 years ago. My country also suffered tremendously \r\nfrom those horrendous acts executed by the great \r\nchampions of deception and iniquity, who were \r\nresponsible for enslaving thousands of men, women \r\nand children and shipping them to foreign shores under \r\ninhumane conditions using malicious torture. The days \r\nof blackbirding are long gone, but the bitter memories \r\nand injurious social consequences are entrenched in the \r\nhistory of my country and people. I honour all the \r\ndescendants of slaves for their courage and their \r\ndetermination to live on. They deserve a special place \r\nin the countries in which their forefathers were forced \r\nto live. There also remains a huge debt owed to the \r\ncountries that suffered large human losses from those \r\nheinous crimes against humanity. We cannot exonerate \r\nthe past, but we can all hope for a just and better \r\nfuture. All countries must work together to prevent \r\nother insidious contemporary forms of slavery that \r\nhave established themselves in our societies. \r\n I welcome and support the decision to make \r\nclimate change the theme of this session of the General \r\nAssembly. In the same vein, my Government highly \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 2 \r\n \r\ncommends the Secretary-General for convening last \r\nweek’s high-level meeting, which should provide an \r\nimportant catalyst for the conference to be held later \r\nthis year in Bali. \r\n I should now like to take this opportunity to \r\nrecognize and commend the work done under the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange to address the effects of climate change and to \r\npromote mitigation and adaptation strategies. But the \r\npoint must be made that rapidly reducing the emission \r\nof greenhouse gases by all major emitters must be \r\nensured within the next 10 to 15 years.  \r\n We followed with great interest the recent debate \r\nabout the criteria and rules that the United Nations uses \r\nto decide whether a country should or should not be \r\nremoved from its list of least developed countries. \r\nGraduation is desirable and fair if, and only if, it is the \r\nculmination of a process of structural progress over \r\ntime — that is to say, progress based on irreversible \r\nimprovements in the structure of the economy or in the \r\nbasic indicators of development. It is only fair and \r\nlogical, therefore, that the criteria used as a basis for \r\nidentifying a country for graduation should be \r\nstructural criteria. \r\n The United Nations currently uses three criteria \r\nto identify cases for graduation. Admittedly, only two \r\nof the three are structural in nature. One relates to \r\nhuman capital — essentially as regards health and \r\neducation — and the other to economic vulnerability. \r\nThe proponents of reform of the graduation rule rightly \r\npostulate that those two criteria together should form \r\nthe basis for identifying a country for graduation. The \r\ncurrent graduation rule allows the United Nations to \r\ndeclare a country ready for graduation even if only one \r\nof those two paramount thresholds has been met. We \r\nconsider the current practice to be conceptually flawed \r\nand fraught with serious implications. We believe this \r\nanomaly can easily be remedied. \r\n My Government is of the view that the General \r\nAssembly should invite the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to revisit the graduation rule in the light of the \r\nongoing debate, and that the experts who advise the \r\nCouncil should be mandated to explore reform of the \r\nrule with a view to making human assets and economic \r\nvulnerability paramount. Such a reform would do \r\njustice to countries that have not achieved the implied \r\nstructural progress. The Government of Vanuatu will \r\ndo its utmost to cooperate with the relevant United \r\nNations bodies and other like-minded nations and \r\nfriends in forging consensus on this matter. I am \r\nconvinced that such consensus implicitly exists, and \r\nneeds only to be formalized. \r\n Experts and members of the Committee for \r\nDevelopment Policy should also be encouraged to \r\nundertake in-country consultations and to experience \r\nfirst-hand the development conditions of countries that \r\nare on the verge of graduation. We are talking about the \r\nlivelihoods of peoples who may be seriously affected \r\nby decisions that are made at the United Nations. \r\n We must continue to work together in shaping the \r\narchitecture of the United Nations so that it is more \r\nresourceful and relevant to our times and to the peoples \r\nwhom we represent. \r\n I would like to commend the United Nations for \r\nincreasing its presence in the Pacific region though its \r\ncountry-based offices. We will encourage more \r\ndecentralization of functions to regional offices, which \r\nare better suited to responding to the needs of \r\nMembers.  \r\n The situation in the Middle East is of grave \r\nconcern to all peace-loving Members of the United \r\nNations. We earnestly pray and hope for an early end to \r\nthe conflict and to the suffering of all innocent \r\nchildren, women and men. Both Israel and Palestine \r\nhave the right to live in peaceful coexistence as \r\nindependent and sovereign States. The international \r\ncommunity must be realistic about the future. Let us \r\nallow justice, security and long-lasting peace to prevail \r\nfor both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. \r\n My Government very much welcomes the \r\nadoption of the Declaration on the Rights of \r\nIndigenous Peoples. It is our hope that the Declaration \r\nwill provide a framework for addressing the grievances \r\nof indigenous peoples, who remain suppressed, \r\nalienated and disadvantaged in the land of their \r\nforefathers. We can only hope that this instrument will \r\nprovide an enabling mechanism to allow indigenous \r\npeoples the freedom to fully participate, without fear of \r\nreprisals, in the affairs and development of their \r\ncountries. The Declaration should also serve to restore \r\ndignity to those who have remained second-class \r\ncitizens in the land of their fathers. We cannot turn \r\nback the clock, but we can create a better future for \r\nthem. \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n3 07-52299 \r\n \r\n The Charter of the United Nations espouses the \r\nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization’s \r\nefforts in the process of self-determination. The \r\nCharter calls for recognition of, and respect for, the \r\nfundamental and inalienable rights of people and \r\nterritories still under colonial rule to determine their \r\nown future. We cannot champion democracy while \r\nturning a blind eye to those who have cried out for \r\npeace and freedom for many years, as have our \r\nbrothers in West Papua. It is the moral responsibility of \r\nthe Organization to act with diligence and to work \r\ntowards promoting better conditions in larger freedom. \r\n Finally, I would like to acknowledge the support \r\nof Vanuatu’s major development partners — in \r\nparticular Australia, New Zealand, France, Japan, the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, the United States of \r\nAmerica and the European Union. I would also like to \r\nexpress my Government’s gratitude to India, Thailand, \r\nMalaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Turkey and various \r\nUnited Nations agencies for their ongoing \r\ncontributions to the development of Vanuatu. \r\n In conclusion, the world we live in today can \r\nonly become a better place if all countries — big and \r\nsmall, powerful and weak — recognize, understand, \r\nvalue and respect each other as equals. The pride of the \r\nhuman person is the essence of building equality \r\nbetween all persons. Respect also means accepting the \r\nnational sovereignty of each individual country and \r\nrefraining from interfering in the internal affairs of any \r\nState. If we are to work towards building a future that \r\nwill provide security, peace, hope and prosperity for all \r\nfuture generations, those important values must be \r\nupheld at all times. \r\n May I remind the Assembly that our personal \r\naims should not be paramount. We must work with all \r\nthe diligence and wisdom that God the Almighty has \r\ngiven us to serve His people.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency The Honourable Archibald Lesao Lehohla, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs \r\nand Public Safety of Lesotho. \r\n Mr. Lehohla (Lesotho): My delegation associates \r\nitself with the compliments extended to Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim on his election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at this session and to his predecessor, \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain. I also \r\nwish to take this opportunity to welcome His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to assure him of my \r\ncountry’s unconditional support during his tenure as \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. \r\n Lesotho congratulates the presidency on having \r\ninvited Member States to comment on the theme \r\n“Responding to Climate Change” during this session. \r\nIn 1992, the first Earth Summit, the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development, was \r\nheld in Rio de Janeiro. It was at that conference that we \r\ncommitted ourselves to achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century. We reaffirmed \r\nour commitments in Johannesburg at the 2002 World \r\nSummit on Sustainable Development. It would seem \r\nthat, for far too long thereafter, we agreed to disagree \r\nuntil we were confronted by the glaring and compelling \r\nscientific evidence that the link between global \r\nwarming and human activities was unequivocal. We \r\nwaited for the adverse effects of climate change to \r\nbegin to be felt all over the globe before we could \r\nacknowledge that consensus was essential for \r\nconcerted action on climate change. \r\n Sadly, natural disasters have begun to strike. As is \r\nusually the case, it is the poorest nations and the most \r\nvulnerable countries that are being worst affected. My \r\ncountry is one of these. Unfavourable climatic \r\nconditions that are attributable to climate change have \r\nled to severe drought, which has resulted in acute food \r\nshortages. In order to address that crisis, my \r\nGovernment has declared a state of emergency on food \r\nsecurity. \r\n As the world prepares for the United Nations \r\nclimate change conference, which will take place in \r\nBali, Indonesia, in December 2007, we need to be \r\nreminded of the urgent need to build a solid and \r\nsustainable consensus on a global response to climate \r\nchange for the period following the expiry of the 1997 \r\nKyoto Protocol in the year 2012. My delegation calls \r\nupon the international community to endeavour to \r\nreach consensus on, among other things, steps that \r\nmust be taken to reach the 60 to 80 per cent emission \r\ncuts that are required to stabilize the atmosphere. In \r\nthat regard, the industrialized countries must assume \r\nthe major responsibility, because scientific evidence \r\nhas confirmed that it is the greenhouse gas emissions \r\nfrom those countries that are making natural disasters \r\nworse. The international community must also reaffirm \r\nits commitment to assisting the regions, such as Africa, \r\nthat are the most vulnerable to climate change. In \r\naddition, my delegation calls upon developed countries \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 4 \r\n \r\nto assist developing countries in strengthening their \r\ncapacity to adapt to climate change. \r\n Allow us further to share our thoughts on what \r\nwe consider to be the role of the United Nations in the \r\ntwenty-first century. Our thoughts cover three areas: \r\ndemocracy, conflicts and development.  \r\n The United Nations was formed against the \r\nbackdrop of colonialism, particularly on the African \r\ncontinent. As colonial rule slowly but surely ended, it \r\nleft behind a legacy of undemocratic Governments. \r\nAfrican countries were characterized by coups d’état \r\nday in, day out. Very few African countries have not \r\nhad the “pleasure” of military rule. \r\n Faced with that disturbing reality, some regional \r\norganizations adopted instruments to deal with \r\nunconstitutional changes of Government by carrying \r\nout sanctions. Here, mention should be made of the \r\nOrganization of African Unity; its successor, the \r\nAfrican Union; and the Commonwealth group of \r\nnations. Significantly, however, our Organization, the \r\nUnited Nations, has not adopted any instrument to \r\ncarry out sanctions against defaulting Member States. \r\nThat is what the United Nations must now do. \r\n Today, the overwhelming majority of the world’s \r\ncountries adhere to the principles of democracy. Those \r\ncountries hold periodic elections. However, the \r\nbroadest common denominator of developing countries \r\nis the non-acceptance of election results; it has become \r\na tradition for losing political parties to dispute them. \r\nRegrettably, that is done through unlawful means more \r\noften than not, despite the fact that there are always \r\nlawful mechanisms for challenging election results. \r\nThis is one area in which we see a role for the United \r\nNations, as the universal institution with the capacity \r\nnecessary to assist requesting Member States in \r\nreversing these trends. \r\n Just as the United Nations plays a critical role in \r\nworld economic development, it should see as part of \r\nits role aggressively inculcating the culture of \r\ndemocracy in all nations. In particular, the \r\nOrganization must help developing countries fight the \r\nculture of impunity. The common understanding must \r\nbe a simple one: “When the people have spoken, \r\nrespect their voice”. Victors must learn to accept \r\nvictory with humility and magnanimity, and losers to \r\naccept defeat with grace. In that way, the post-election \r\nperiod can be devoted to development, with all sides \r\njoining hands in a collective national effort. We must \r\nhasten to acknowledge the role that the United Nations \r\nis now playing in democratization processes, but we \r\nfeel that it can do more. \r\n That brings us to the second area: conflicts. \r\nConflicts always feature prominently in our addresses \r\nbefore the Assembly. We must acknowledge that inter-\r\nState conflicts are on the decline across the globe. The \r\nsame, however, cannot be said about internal conflicts. \r\nIt cannot be denied that intra-State conflicts occur \r\nwhere there is little or no regard for democratic \r\ngovernance. If a country is not accustomed to holding \r\nelections or to accepting election results, conflicts \r\narise. Other causes, which are also attributable to lack \r\nof democratic governance, include a lack of judicious \r\nsharing of a country’s wealth, rampant poverty and \r\nethnic strife. \r\n In all such conflicts, small arms and light \r\nweapons have become weapons of choice. We therefore \r\nstill consider it regrettable that in the year 2005, \r\nMember States were not able to adopt a legally binding \r\ninternational instrument on the marking and tracing of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons. We share the view that \r\nsuch an instrument could curtail the production, \r\ntransfer and civilian possession of illicit small arms \r\nand light weapons. It is the urgent responsibility of the \r\nUnited Nations to facilitate the adoption of an effective \r\ninternational instrument for curbing the illicit trade in \r\nconventional weapons, which would make it harder for \r\nsuch weapons to end up in the hands of criminals. We \r\nhope that the arms trade treaty that is being proposed \r\ncan be concluded expeditiously. \r\n We must recall that in the year 2005, the \r\nAssembly solemnly proclaimed that the role of the \r\nentire international community, acting through the \r\nUnited Nations, was to protect populations from \r\ngenocide, war crimes and other crimes against \r\nhumanity. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening \r\non the ground. We still notice inaction on the part of \r\nthe Security Council, or its reaction coming too late. \r\nThe harrowing experiences of Rwanda and now Darfur \r\nare living testimony to that. We attribute such inaction \r\nto the skewed composition and powers of the Council, \r\nespecially the right of veto, which we are now \r\nconvinced, more than ever before, is extremely \r\nsubjective and exercised according to the interests of \r\nthe concerned permanent member. That has, in some \r\ninstances, caused a breaking of the ranks among the \r\nbig five. \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n5 07-52299 \r\n \r\n We continue to witness unilateral economic and \r\nfinancial blockades being imposed against other \r\ncountries, and the denial to peoples of their right to \r\nself-determination, while others are still subject to \r\noccupation. Cuba, Palestine and the Western Sahara are \r\nhere cases in point. We submit that it must remain the \r\nrole of the United Nations in the twenty-first century to \r\nproactively preserve international peace and security. \r\nOur call is therefore that, where peace and security are \r\nthreatened, the United Nations, through the Security \r\nCouncil, must act swiftly and decisively at all times. \r\n But the United Nations can do so only if its \r\nstructures are reformed to make them democratic and \r\nrepresentative. Our basic premise would continue to be \r\nthat the United Nations in the twenty-first century \r\nshould inculcate democracy not only in Member \r\ncountries, but also within itself. \r\n It is a hard fact that the reform of the United \r\nNations will not be complete without the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Members of this body have on \r\nseveral occasions reiterated the fact that the Security \r\nCouncil in its current form does not reflect the realities \r\nof today’s world, and yet, for more than a decade now, \r\nthe Assembly has remained stagnant on that issue. The \r\npresentation per se of various positions by major \r\nstakeholders, as well as various attempts to bridge \r\nmajor differences in those positions, have thus far \r\nfailed to produce tangible results. Hence, my \r\ndelegation shares the view that it is now time to move \r\nforward and begin intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nHowever, we wish to underline that, while the reform \r\nof the Security Council is possible, all Member States \r\nneed to garner the necessary political will to attain that \r\ngoal. The credibility of the Council is at stake. \r\n Sustainable world peace and stability create the \r\nnecessary space to deal with the development \r\nchallenges of our countries and peoples. The world has \r\nacknowledged that the HIV and AIDS pandemic \r\nrepresents the top most challenge. The untold miseries \r\nbrought about by that scourge are common cause. To \r\nthe extent that no cure is available, HIV/AIDS will \r\ncontinue to be a threat to human existence. That threat, \r\nparticularly in Africa, is compounded by worsening \r\npoverty and famine levels brought about, in most \r\ncases, by unfavourable weather conditions, \r\ncompliments — in large measure, of climate change. \r\n It is our view that, in a country enjoying political \r\nstability, the potential for all sectors of that nation to \r\naddress those challenges is greatly enhanced. \r\nMoreover, no economic development can take place \r\nwithout democracy, peace and stability. Of course, the \r\nsupport of the developed countries will always be \r\ncalled for; hence, the need for them to fulfil their \r\npromise on official development assistance, which \r\nplays such a critical role in the economic development \r\nof the developing countries. \r\n My delegation congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his commitment to the \r\nstrengthening of the Organization. For this \r\nOrganization to acquit itself successfully in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, the role of its Secretary-General must \r\nremain sacrosanct. He must remain immune to \r\ninfluence by the interests of any groups or Powers. He \r\nmust be faithful to the interests of all in the service of \r\nour family of nations. Above all, he must help, through \r\nthe United Nations, to create a world at peace with \r\nitself. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Come Zoumara, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and \r\nla Francophonie of the Central African Republic. \r\n Mr. Zoumara (Central African Republic) (spoke \r\nin French): On behalf of the delegation of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, and in the name of our Head of \r\nState, President of the Republic François Bozizé, I \r\nextend warm and heartfelt congratulations to \r\nMr. Kerim on his election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session. We are also \r\ngratified to assert that his distinctive skills will \r\nguarantee the success of our work. \r\n I also wish to pay a warm tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain. Five decades after the presidency \r\nof Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit of India, she wisely led \r\nthe work of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, to the great satisfaction of all. \r\n Finally, on behalf of President of the Republic \r\nand Head of State François Bozizé, allow me to \r\naddress our sincere congratulations to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his dynamism and the \r\nefficiency with which he has undertaken his work in \r\nthe context of current important international issues, \r\nincluding the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, climate change, human rights, and combating \r\ndrugs and terrorism in all its forms, which remain \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 6 \r\n \r\npressing issues that no country in the world can address \r\nin isolation. \r\n The conflicts afflicting the innocent civilian \r\npopulations in the Middle East, the Great Lakes region \r\nand the Sudan, a neighbour of the Central African \r\nRepublic, with their hosts of refugees and displaced \r\npersons, are causes of grave concern. The conflict in \r\nDarfur and the presence of rebels, armed groups and \r\nroad-blockers cause the proliferation and unlawful \r\ncirculation of small arms in that subregion, thus \r\nprovoking widespread and continuous insecurity.  \r\n The consequences for the Central African \r\nRepublic often take the shape of recurrent crises that \r\nchronically undermine the economic fabric and \r\naggravate the poverty of our people by creating \r\nhazardous and precarious living conditions. All of this \r\nleads to the breakdown of the social fabric, the loss of \r\ncivic spirit and, ultimately, the failure of confidence in \r\ntheir institutions and, especially, in justice.  \r\n We applaud the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1778 (2007) on the deployment of the hybrid \r\nmultidimensional force to the borders of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, Chad and the Sudan. We should like \r\nto see it accompanied, however, by genuine support for \r\nthe reinforcement of institutional capacities in the \r\nCentral African Republic. In that regard, we thank and \r\npraise France for its courageous decision and effective \r\nparticipation in that peacekeeping force. \r\n During the fifteenth session of the Commission \r\non Sustainable Development, held in New York from \r\n30 April to 11 May 2007, whose chosen theme was \r\nturning commitments into action and working together \r\nin partnership, participants highlighted the correlation \r\nand interdependence among the four areas of the \r\nthematic cluster: energy for sustainable development, \r\nindustrial development, air pollution and climate \r\nchange. The Commission’s fifteenth session also \r\ndemonstrated that much significant progress remains to \r\nbe achieved: advances in those sectors are minimal and \r\nstill far from the objectives the international \r\ncommunity set for itself in Rio in 1992 and in \r\nJohannesburg in 2002. \r\n In order to meet these challenges of the \r\nenvironment in particular and sustainable development \r\nin general, a partnership endeavour, supported by \r\nsufficient resources, is absolutely essential in order to \r\nallow developing countries, in particular in Africa, the \r\nCaribbean and the South Pacific, to implement these \r\ncommitments, especially since those regions, and \r\nparticularly Africa, while bearing but little \r\nresponsibility for the advent of this phenomenon, are \r\nmore vulnerable to the risks associated with climate \r\nchange. \r\n By choosing climate change as a central topic of \r\nthis General Assembly session and organizing the high-\r\nlevel dialogue “The future in our hands: Addressing the \r\nleadership challenge of climate change”, the Assembly \r\nPresident has pinpointed the growing concern \r\nassociated with global warming for a country such as \r\nours, the Central African Republic. Indeed, the \r\nproblems associated with climate change now lie at the \r\ncore of international debates. The moment has thus \r\narrived to transform good intentions into concrete \r\nactions. \r\n For its part, the Central African Republic hopes \r\nthat during the Bali Climate Change Conference this \r\nDecember the wealthy countries will at last honour \r\ntheir commitments in the area of technology transfer \r\nand will provide assistance to strengthening the \r\nnational and regional structures required for effective \r\naction to combat climate change. I would like to pay a \r\nwarm tribute to the Secretary-General for the interest \r\nhe has shown in these problems and for his initiative of \r\nappointing three special envoys in the area of climate \r\nchange. \r\n Allow me to present the specific case of my \r\ncountry, the Central African Republic, which spans \r\nthree climatic zones, with great diversity in its \r\necosystem, from dense humid forest in the south, to the \r\npre-Sahelian area in the north.  \r\n This central position at the crossroads of different \r\nAfrican ecosystems — from the Sudan-Sahelian areas \r\nin the north to the dense humid forest in the south — \r\ngives it great ecological potential. It has many assets: \r\nrich and fertile soil, mineral and forest wealth, \r\ndiversified fauna and varied agriculture, with the latter \r\nbeing the country’s economic base. \r\n The Central African Republic understands the \r\nwealth of its natural resources, but also the threats \r\ninvolved. That is why we have built environmental \r\nconcerns into the constitution of our country, notably \r\nin its preamble and its article 9 where the collective \r\nconsciousness is called upon to respect the principle of \r\ngood environmental governance.  \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n7 07-52299 \r\n \r\n Despite these resources, the economic reality of \r\nthe country shows that the Central African Republic is \r\namong the least developed countries, where the \r\npopulation lives on less than a dollar a day. In recent \r\nyears, the rate of economic growth has fallen below the \r\naverage predictions. Structurally, the country comes up \r\nagainst many obstacles in its development efforts. For \r\ninstance, its domestic market is tiny, and it is isolated \r\ndomestically and externally because of its distance \r\nfrom maritime ports. The economic situation may be \r\nsummed up as follows: lack of individual income, \r\nlimited State resources, inequality between men and \r\nwomen and the rate of illiteracy.  \r\n Our economy is largely dependent on \r\nenvironmental resources. Aware of the difficulties it \r\nfaces, the Government has opted for regional and \r\ninternational cooperation by participating in many \r\ninitiatives concerning the environment and sustainable \r\nforestry management, such as the Central African \r\nForest Commission, the Network of Protected Areas of \r\nCentral Africa, the Sangha Tri-National Landscape and \r\nthe Congo Basin Forest Partnership. \r\n Generally speaking, the implementation of most \r\nof these initiatives has not met expectations: the \r\ninitiatives were ambitious, but the capacities for \r\nimplementation and the financial resources were \r\ninadequate. The enterprises exploiting these resources \r\nimpose binding environmental rules on us while the \r\npopulation does not reap any benefit.  \r\n We need to halt and eliminate poverty with the \r\nparticipation of all. Poverty creates injustice. Here I \r\nwish to cite President Sarkozy, the printed text of \r\nwhose recent statement observed that justice meant the \r\nsame chances for success for each poor child in the \r\nworld as for each rich one. In this very Hall, President \r\nSarkozy said:  \r\n “Justice means that a developing country on \r\nwhich we wish to impose environmental rules, \r\neven though its inhabitants have barely enough to \r\neat, can be helped to put such rules in place. \r\nJustice means that we cannot tap a country’s \r\nresources without paying a fair price for them. \r\n “... \r\n  “I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to \r\nconcern itself with the issue of fairer distribution \r\nof wealth and of the income derived from \r\ncommodities and technology” (A/62/PV.4). \r\n The Central African Republic is ready to open its \r\nborders to developed nations and to public and private \r\ninvestors in order to increase its resources. The Central \r\nAfrican Republic applauds the great nations — France, \r\nthe United States, China, Japan, Germany, Britain and \r\nRussia and certain emerging countries of the South — \r\nfor their willingness to cooperate in order to slow the \r\ndeterioration of the environment. \r\n We thank the European Union and the African \r\nDevelopment Bank for their assistance and, in \r\nparticular, the International Monetary Fund and the \r\nWorld Bank for having allowed the Central African \r\nRepublic to reach the decision point under the \r\nenhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. \r\nWe praise the actions of those international financial \r\ninstitutions, and we ask them to open a new chapter on \r\nthe environment and the economies of poor countries. \r\n We call on all for a continuing effort to reduce \r\ninequality between men and women, because in Africa, \r\nwomen are very often heads of families in the most \r\nremote regions. They play a very important role. In that \r\nway, the support of the international community in \r\neliminating inequality will provide a solution in terms \r\nof sustainable development.  \r\n We cannot achieve a healthy environment without \r\nwiping out illiteracy. We hope that the developed \r\ncountries of the South and the North will help poor \r\ncountries to create the right conditions in terms of \r\ninforming and training their populations in order to \r\nshow them that they have an interest in preserving the \r\nenvironment. \r\n Our country is rich. It wishes to exploit the \r\nwealth of its subsoil in order to protect its \r\nenvironment. With assistance, we can hope to bring \r\nourselves closer to the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby 2015.  \r\n In his opening statement, the President stated, \r\n“Keep your mind level. If the mind is level, the whole \r\nworld will be level” (A/62/PV.4). \r\n The President of the Central African Republic, \r\nMr. François Bozizé, often teaches us about the mind — \r\nthe spirit: \r\n “Infinite spirit is all. All is one. All is all. \r\nAnd all is the Universe. The Universe is calm. If \r\nwe have understood this, let the world follow the \r\nexample of the wise by avoiding the errors of the \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 8 \r\n \r\nsemi-wise who perish because of their \r\nfoolishness”. \r\n I would like to hope that this message will be \r\nfavourably received by our partners, both bilateral and \r\nmultilateral. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Uganda. \r\n Mr. Kutesa (Uganda): Allow me at the outset to \r\nextend our congratulations to Mr. Kerim on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. I wish to thank most sincerely his \r\npredecessor, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nKhalifa of Bahrain, for the able manner in which she \r\nhandled the vital business of the sixty-first session. I \r\nalso wish to express my gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership of our \r\nOrganization, and most especially for his untiring \r\nefforts in favour of conflict resolution and peace on the \r\nAfrican continent and elsewhere. \r\n Sixty-two years ago, the founding fathers of the \r\nUnited Nations came together, determined, in the \r\nwords of the Charter, “to employ international \r\nmachinery for the promotion of the economic and \r\nsocial advancement of all peoples”. The Organization \r\nthey created was to be a centre for harmonizing the \r\nactions of nations in the attainment of these common \r\ngoals. Today humankind is faced with a common threat \r\nin the form of climate change. The General Assembly’s \r\nchoice of responding to climate change as the theme \r\nfor this session is timely. It will help draw attention to \r\nthe global challenge for which no single country has a \r\nsolution. It is only through concerted and sustained \r\ninternational cooperation that action to combat the \r\neffects and further escalation of climate change can be \r\ntaken. \r\n There is no doubt that climate change is the \r\nbiggest danger facing humankind, especially the poor. \r\nThe threat of extreme conditions, including floods and \r\ndrought, is a major concern. It has many implications \r\nfor development, particularly for agrarian communities \r\nwith fewer resources to cope with additional stresses \r\nand shocks brought about by this phenomenon. The \r\nincreasing frequency and severity of prolonged drought \r\nthreaten water supplies to millions of people in poor \r\ncountries, as well as agriculture which is \r\noverwhelmingly subsistence and rain-fed and, \r\ntherefore, vulnerable to climate variability and change. \r\n The vulnerability of the health sector has also \r\nbeen evident as frequent floods result in outbreaks of \r\nwaterborne diseases, such as cholera, typhoid, \r\ndysentery and the increased incidence of malaria. \r\n Indeed, climate change today constitutes a danger \r\nto human security, considering the effects of climate \r\nchange on the very existence of some small island \r\nStates and coastal cities, as well as the devastation by \r\nhurricanes and typhoons. \r\n Several years ago, the world was alerted to the \r\ndanger of climate change. Under the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, a number \r\nof actions were agreed upon. We all agreed to \r\nundertake a three-pronged approach, including \r\ndevelopment, access to appropriate technology, \r\nmitigation and adaptation. It is unfortunate that, so far, \r\nno meaningful actions have been undertaken to \r\nimplement these agreed interventions. \r\n My delegation believes that the time is now to \r\nimplement these high-priority activities. We should, \r\nhowever, recognize that responding to climate change \r\nwill require political leadership at all levels, starting \r\nfrom the centre and extending to the grassroots. \r\nIncreasing collaborative action on adaptation is \r\nurgently needed, so that vulnerable countries and \r\ncommunities can cope with the unavoidable impact of \r\nclimate change. Reforestation efforts and control of \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions are urgent actions that we \r\ncan undertake together. However, reforestation on its \r\nown will not produce the desired results without \r\nadequate investment in renewable energy sources as a \r\nmeasure against the massive depletion of forests for \r\nfuel. Developed countries should encourage companies \r\nto invest in hydro-electric power generation and other \r\nclean energy sources in developing countries. For such \r\nprojects to be undertaken, measures such as a \r\nsuccessful fifteenth International Development \r\nAssociation replenishment is critical. We all must learn \r\nto safeguard and use available resources sparingly for \r\nthe sake of future generations. \r\n Uganda considers the United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference, to be held in Bali, Indonesia, this \r\nDecember, to be critical in the development of a long-\r\nterm response to climate change. It is an opportunity to \r\nbegin concrete negotiations on a global strategy that is \r\nacceptable to all and implementable. Prior to Bali, \r\nhowever, this Assembly should agree on guiding \r\nprinciples that can help bring together all relevant \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n9 07-52299 \r\n \r\naspects of the problem. The industrialized countries \r\nshould take the lead in cutting emissions, while \r\ndeveloping countries will have to pursue low-emission \r\ndevelopment strategies and benefit from incentives for \r\nassistance for adaptation and for limiting emissions. \r\nWe must commit ourselves to an approach that \r\nbalances adaptation and mitigation, underpinned by \r\nadequate financing arrangements and investments in \r\nnew and innovative technologies. \r\n As Members of the United Nations, our countries \r\nshare a vision of a better standard of life, in larger \r\nfreedom, as enshrined in our Charter. We are, however, \r\nchallenged by a persistence of poverty in many of our \r\ncountries. Recent statistics indicate that, worldwide, \r\n1.2 billion people live on one dollar a day, while \r\n2.8 billion survive on less than two dollars. The gap \r\nbetween the rich and the poor continues to widen, both \r\nwithin States and among States. \r\n The World Bank reported in 2003 that average \r\nincome in the wealthiest 20 countries is 37 times that \r\nof the poorest 20, which is twice the ratio of what it \r\nwas in 1970. Many countries, especially those in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, ended the last decade with lower \r\nper capita incomes than at its beginning. Poverty is one \r\nof the biggest threats to international peace, security \r\nand the environment. \r\n At the Millennium Summit, world leaders \r\nexpressed their determination to halve world poverty \r\nby the year 2015. The midpoint progress report on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that was \r\nreleased in July this year indicates that countries in \r\nAfrica and elsewhere are proving that large-scale \r\nprogress in achieving the MDGs is possible under \r\nconditions of adequate financing, much of which \r\nshould flow from a strengthened global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. It is critical that the Monterrey targets be \r\nmet. \r\n As we respond to climate change, the fight \r\nagainst poverty remains an integral part of the effort. \r\nUnless we address poverty in developing countries, the \r\npoor will continue to destroy the environment by \r\ncutting trees for firewood and employing poor \r\nagricultural practices. \r\n There are time-tested ways to bring people out of \r\npoverty. Trade liberalization and export-led growth \r\nhave the potential to lift millions out of poverty. \r\nHowever, to benefit from trade, developing countries \r\nmust add value to their raw materials and sell them as \r\nfinished products, taking advantage of appropriate \r\nvalue chains. That will not only increase earnings but \r\ncreate jobs, thus ending the mass migrations to the \r\ndeveloped countries. They should develop their human \r\nresources through education and better health services. \r\nEducation is a critical factor in transforming society. \r\nAn educated middle class with adequate income to \r\nspend is critical for industrialization and the transition \r\nof societies. That has happened in some countries of \r\nSouth-East Asia; it can happen elsewhere in the \r\ndeveloping world. As a priority, agriculture needs to be \r\ncommercialized. Related to that is the urgent need for \r\nregional integration so as to enlarge markets. \r\n Under heavy pressure, many developing countries \r\nhave removed trade barriers, while the developed \r\ncountries have not reciprocated in such key areas as \r\nagriculture and textiles, where the former have a \r\ncomparative advantage. Is it not absurd that a cow in \r\nthe European Union gets a daily subsidy of $2.2, while \r\n40 per cent of the world’s population lives on less than \r\n$2 a day? The World Bank estimates that protectionism \r\nby the developed world costs developing countries \r\n$100 billion annually. A fair system will require \r\nappropriate measures to deal with the unfair trade \r\nprivileges of developed countries that hinder market \r\naccess. It is vital that the stalled trade talks under the \r\nDoha Development Round be resumed and \r\nsuccessfully concluded. \r\n Peace and security are necessary conditions for \r\nsustainable development. The rise in inter- and intra-\r\nState conflict has been the hallmark of the post-cold-\r\nwar era. Internal conflicts have spilled over borders to \r\ncreate regional instability. Internal displacement has \r\ntaken place, and equally alarming has been the \r\ninternational refugee crisis that has resulted from such \r\nconflicts. In some countries, central authority has \r\ncollapsed, creating havens for terrorists and drug \r\ntraffickers, with the attendant threats to international \r\npeace and security. No meaningful actions against \r\npoverty and in favour of environmental protection can \r\ntake place in that kind of atmosphere. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Most of Africa is now peaceful, and democracy is \r\nbeing consolidated through regular elections, the \r\nobservance of human rights and constitutionalism. \r\nHowever, there are some areas that require urgent \r\ninternational attention. There is a need to ensure peace \r\nand stability in Darfur in accordance with the \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 10 \r\n \r\ninternationally agreed framework under Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1769 (2007). Further attention \r\nshould be given to supporting the implementation of \r\nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the Sudan People’s \r\nLiberation Movement in the South. \r\n In Somalia, the General Assembly should support \r\nan all-inclusive peace and reconciliation process and \r\nthe Africa Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM) with the necessary resources to facilitate \r\nthe peacekeeping. Uganda has honoured its pledge of \r\ntroops for peacekeeping; we call on other countries that \r\nmade similar pledges to fulfil them. The international \r\neffort in Somalia should focus on capacity-building to \r\nempower the Somali people to solve their own \r\nproblems. We also call on the Secretary-General to \r\nfinalize plans for possible deployment of a United \r\nNations peacekeeping force to replace AMISOM, as \r\ncalled for in Security Council resolution 1772 (2007). \r\n In the Great Lakes region, various efforts are \r\nunder way to improve peace and security and to create \r\nan atmosphere conducive to development. Through the \r\nTripartite Plus One Commission, bringing together the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi \r\nand Uganda, we have agreed on a framework and \r\nactions to deal with negative forces that pose a threat \r\nto peace and security in the region. In that regard, we \r\nrefer to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and \r\nto provisions of Security Council resolution 1756 \r\n(2007). The Security Council should reinforce the \r\nmandate and the means of the United Nations \r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo to enable it effectively to work with \r\nCongolese armed forces to totally eradicate the threat \r\nof negative forces operating in the territory of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n In northern Uganda, we are holding peace talks \r\nwith the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). Of the five \r\nagenda items, two agreements have been concluded \r\nand signed. Those are the Cessation of Hostilities \r\nAgreement and an agreement on comprehensive \r\nsolutions. However, the LRA has not met any of the \r\nterms of the very first Agreement on Cessation of \r\nHostilities. For example, it is stipulated that LRA \r\nforces assemble at Ri-Kwangba in southern Sudan; \r\nthey have, however, not done so to date. They are still \r\ncamped in Garamba National park in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. We urge the international \r\ncommunity to bring adequate pressure to bear on the \r\nLRA to assemble at Ri-Kwangba and to set a time \r\nframe for the talks. Talks cannot go on forever. As we \r\ninch towards a comprehensive peace agreement, \r\ninternational support and understanding are required to \r\nbalance the need for durable peace and stability on the \r\none hand, and the imperative for justice on the other. \r\n I wish to assure the General Assembly that \r\nUganda is fully aware of its obligations under the \r\nRome Statute and cannot undermine it. We cannot \r\ncondone impunity. To that end, we are working closely \r\nwith the International Criminal Court to ensure \r\naccountability under the complementarity stipulations. \r\nUganda will be convening a Consultative Group \r\nmeeting later this year to mobilize resources and \r\ncoordinate actions for the post-conflict reconciliation \r\nprogramme in northern Uganda. The international \r\ncommunity is invited to support that programme. \r\n When you chose “Responding to climate change” \r\nas the theme for this session, Sir, I believe you \r\nintended to have this session consider and recommend \r\nways of addressing that common threat. You believed, \r\nas indeed we do, that a world that pays no attention to \r\nthat problem is fatally damaging the interests of future \r\ngenerations. Addressing climate change will involve \r\nfighting poverty, ensuring peace and security, and \r\ninvesting in clean energy, especially in developing \r\ncountries. This session should be the turning point at \r\nwhich we all come together and agree on ways to save \r\nour planet. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Kinga Göncz, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Hungary. \r\n Mrs. Göncz (Hungary): Allow me first of all to \r\nwarmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. I am pleased to see you, a high-ranking official \r\nfrom the rather underrepresented Eastern European \r\nGroup, assuming that prestigious post of the United \r\nNations. In fulfilling your challenging tasks during this \r\nsession, you may be assured of the support and \r\ncooperation of the delegation of Hungary. I would also \r\nlike to pay tribute to your predecessor, Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa. \r\n During the sixty-first session, Member States \r\nworked hard to come to agreement on the proposals \r\nmade at the 2005 Summit meeting, but we still need to \r\ndo more to ensure that the United Nations system is \r\nmanaged coherently and effectively. I believe that the \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n11 07-52299 \r\n \r\nworld needs, more than ever before, effective \r\nmultilateralism, which is still a key word for the future. \r\nWe should make progress on management reform, \r\nmandate review and disarmament, and define further \r\nconcrete steps towards a renewed Security Council. \r\n Hungary would have preferred for the issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform to have seen more progress \r\nduring the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. \r\nThe impasse was certainly not due to the lack of effort \r\non the part of the President of the General Assembly or \r\nto a shortage of creative ideas. We believe that the best \r\nsolution would still be a balanced increase of seats to \r\nbetter reflect the political realities of today. The \r\nenlargement process should be combined with tangible \r\nimprovement of the Council’s working methods. \r\n We welcome the adoption of the new resolution \r\non the revitalization of the General Assembly. It is up \r\nto each Member State to make the work of the \r\nAssembly meaningful and to ensure that the Assembly \r\ntakes up issues of genuine concern and takes decisions \r\nthat have a real impact on the political process. \r\n Let me now turn to Geneva, where important \r\nreforms have taken place as well. The Human Rights \r\nCouncil has finally started its work, in an atmosphere \r\nof high expectations. The consensus over the universal \r\nperiodic review mechanism sends a clear message that \r\nall countries will have their human rights records \r\nexamined at regular intervals. Thus, no country will be \r\nimmune from international scrutiny. However, in order \r\nto make it truly meaningful, we have to build a credible \r\nand robust mechanism. Special procedures and \r\ncontributions to the review from treaty bodies and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations will prove to be essential \r\nin that regard. \r\n In order to better protect human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, the system of special \r\nprocedures — a unique web of protection — has \r\ncontinued to provide effective action for the benefit of \r\nvictims of human rights abuses. Special rapporteurs \r\nand independent experts have continued their work, \r\ngiving a voice to the voiceless, even at times when the \r\nCouncil was focusing mainly on the task of institution-\r\nbuilding. \r\n We are thoroughly convinced that both thematic \r\nand country-specific mandates remain valid, given the \r\nnumerous human rights violations still occurring on a \r\ndaily basis. In that regard, we concur with the \r\nSecretary-General, who has emphasized the need to \r\nconsider all situations of possible human rights \r\nviolations on an equal footing. Not having a special \r\nrapporteur assigned to a particular country does not \r\nabsolve that country from its obligations under the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and other \r\nhuman rights instruments. \r\n I should now like to share some thoughts about \r\nan issue dear to my country. We welcomed with great \r\nsatisfaction the recent decision of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to establish a forum on minority issues. I am \r\nconfident that the forum will provide a useful platform \r\nfor dialogue and exchange of views between \r\nminorities, Governments and other stakeholders on \r\nissues related to national or ethnic, linguistic and \r\nreligious minorities. \r\n Allow me to place special emphasis on the \r\nempowerment of women. We firmly believe in the need \r\nfor the effective involvement of women in the \r\ndecision-making processes at both the national and the \r\ninternational levels. In that regard, Hungary supports \r\nthe ongoing debate on the future of the strengthened \r\ngender equality architecture. We welcome the steps \r\ntaken towards achieving effective gender \r\nmainstreaming throughout the entire United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n On 30 March, we witnessed the signing ceremony \r\nof the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities. That new international instrument will \r\nimprove the living conditions of almost 650 million \r\npersons with disabilities all over the world, ensuring \r\nequal opportunities for them in all aspects of life. As \r\nthe second State party to ratify the Convention and its \r\nOptional Protocol, we hope that they will enter into \r\nforce soon. \r\n Seven years ago, our Governments made a \r\nremarkable promise to the world in adopting the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Although \r\nthere has certainly been some progress in achieving its \r\nobjectives, there will be regions of the world where the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) will not have \r\nbeen met by 2015 if we do not intensify our efforts. In \r\nthe meantime, we must also emphasize the central role \r\nof national policies and development strategies in \r\nachieving the Goals. The sustainability of development \r\ndepends heavily on national ownership and leadership. \r\nAt the global level, the United Nations has a \r\ncomparative advantage in providing technical \r\nassistance in the preparation and implementation of \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 12 \r\n \r\nnational development plans. We fully support the \r\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on United \r\nNations System-wide Coherence to improve the \r\noperational effectiveness, inter-agency cooperation, \r\npredictability and accountability of the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals represent \r\nthe global commitment to fundamental rights, which \r\nmust be guaranteed if we genuinely seek to strengthen \r\nour democracies. Democracy should also mean \r\ncreating the conditions for sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment that provides people with access — \r\nthrough decent jobs — to opportunities to achieve full \r\npersonal development. \r\n We are particularly pleased that Hungary can \r\nshare its transitional experiences, both as a member of \r\nthe Advisory Board of the United Nations Democracy \r\nFund and through the International Centre for \r\nDemocratic Transition, which is based in Budapest and \r\nwhich has a partnership agreement with the Democracy \r\nFund. The United Nations has a special responsibility \r\nto address challenges related to institution-building and \r\nto promote democracy. As Amartya Sen, the Nobel \r\nPrize winning economist has said, countries need not \r\nbe fit for democracy; they need to become fit through \r\ndemocracy. \r\n Hungary, as an emerging donor, is determined to \r\nmeet the obligations set out in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWe are ready to increase our official development \r\nassistance and to carry out our efforts in line with the \r\nEuropean Consensus on development and the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. However, we are \r\nconvinced that scaling up the volume of aid in itself \r\nwill not necessarily lead to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. It is also important to \r\nemphasize the need for better complementarity, \r\ncoordination and coherence in development \r\ncooperation. \r\n Having been fully integrated into the European \r\nUnion (EU) and NATO structures, we are committed to \r\ncarrying out qualitative change in the outreach of \r\nHungarian foreign policy. We want to make our policy \r\nand our presence more visible in all parts of the world: \r\nan active development cooperation and assistance \r\npolicy coupled with an increased presence in United \r\nNations bodies. We are resolved to attach special \r\nattention to creating more balance in the geographical \r\nscope of our cooperation policy in order to include \r\nAfrican, Asian and Latin American countries. Stepping \r\nup our outreach efforts and developing not only \r\nassistance activities but also economic ties with Africa \r\nwill mark the beginning of a new era in our \r\nrelationship with that continent. \r\n We are also ready to assume more responsibilities \r\nin various international forums. Our ambitions are best \r\nembodied in our application for a non-permanent seat \r\non the Security Council for the period 2012-2013. We \r\nview our potential membership as an opportunity to \r\nengage in constructive cooperation with all our \r\npartners in order to achieve our common objectives on \r\nthe basis of shared interests and values. \r\n Let me now focus on some of the most urgent \r\nforeign policy issues of our day. \r\n Peace and stability in the Balkan region is of \r\nparamount importance to my country, and to Europe as \r\na whole. While the question of the future status of \r\nKosovo has drawn international attention, we are aware \r\nthat the issue of Kosovo is a challenge that needs to be \r\nprimarily tackled by Europe. Nevertheless, the United \r\nNations has played a pivotal role in the process to date. \r\nOur hope is that that will continue to be the case until a \r\nproper solution is found. \r\n There is no doubt that there is a significant role to \r\nbe played by the EU in facilitating a satisfactory \r\nsolution for Kosovo. One thing is certain among all the \r\nuncertainties: the status quo is not a solution. More \r\nthan ever, the region needs stability, economic \r\ndevelopment and inter-ethnic reconciliation. The \r\nEuropean Union has invested much in the region in \r\nterms of material, political and military assistance. It \r\nhas also offered the countries of the region prospects \r\nfor joining the European Union. \r\n With regard to Serbia, we are convinced that \r\nreinforcing the prospects for future membership of the \r\nEU may facilitate finding a solution to the question of \r\nKosovo. Hungary therefore looks forward to a \r\nsuccessful outcome to the new round of negotiations \r\nfacilitated by the EU-United States-Russia Troika, \r\nwhich the parties should approach in a constructive and \r\nfrank manner. We hope that the encouraging signs of \r\ntrust and a constructive approach will prevail in the \r\ncourse of the entire process, and that the parties will be \r\nable to come to an agreement endorsed by the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n13 07-52299 \r\n \r\n We are following with great attention the work of \r\nthe teams set up recently by Israeli Prime Minister \r\nEhud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud \r\nAbbas to negotiate core issues related to a permanent \r\nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We welcome \r\nthe initiative of the President of the United States to \r\nconvene an international conference in November. \r\n Hungary is firmly committed to the \r\nreconstruction of Afghanistan. As a State member of \r\nthe North Atlantic alliance, we have been involved in \r\nthe NATO-led International Security Assistance Force \r\nsince 2003. On 1 October 2006, we took over the \r\nleadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in \r\nBaghlan province. I am proud of the successful work \r\ndone by Hungary’s military contingent and by \r\nHungarian teams of aid workers. Moreover, I can \r\nconfirm our future commitment in Afghanistan, which \r\nenjoys broad political consensus among all the parties \r\nrepresented in the Hungarian parliament. Nevertheless, \r\nwe must not forget that the primary responsibility for \r\nthe stabilization and development of Afghanistan lies \r\nwith the Afghan people themselves. We are concerned \r\nabout the security situation and the attacks carried out \r\nby Taliban and anti-Government forces, and we firmly \r\ncondemn all hostage-taking actions. Drug production \r\nand trafficking continue to be a major source of \r\ninstability, and we note the increase in opium \r\nproduction with grave concern. We encourage the \r\nAfghan Government, working in close cooperation \r\nwith the international community and in particular with \r\nits regional partners, to take effective measures to \r\nstabilize the whole region. \r\n The stabilization of Iraq is one of the major \r\nchallenges in the Middle East. We appreciate the \r\nresults that have been achieved so far in the course of \r\nthe country’s democratic transformation. However, the \r\nIraqi political class needs to overcome the present state \r\nof deep division and start to walk down the path of \r\nreconciliation and cooperation in order to bring peace \r\nand stability to the country. As a precondition for a \r\nlong-lasting settlement of the conflict, the international \r\ncommunity must enable Iraqi leaders to assume \r\nownership and govern their country in an independent \r\nway. \r\n Hungary is very concerned about the acts of \r\nviolence perpetrated by the security forces of the \r\nBurma/Myanmar Government. We are committed to \r\nrespecting human rights and democracy, and we \r\ntherefore strongly condemn the brutal physical attacks \r\nagainst peaceful demonstrators. I reiterate our previous \r\ncall on the Government of Burma/Myanmar to fully \r\nrespect human rights and the norms of democracy, in \r\nparticular the rights to peaceful assembly and to the \r\nfree expression of opinions. \r\n Due to one of the most worrisome conflicts on \r\nthe African continent — the one raging in Darfur — \r\nthe situation in the Sudan and nearby countries is still \r\nunpredictable and explosive. Hungary welcomes the \r\nrenewed momentum in the efforts to resolve the Darfur \r\nconflict, in particular the agreement reached on the \r\ndeployment of the African Union-United Nations \r\nhybrid force and the subsequent adoption of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1769 (2007). We consider it \r\nessential that the Hybrid Operation be launched, and \r\nthat troops be fully deployed in the full number \r\nauthorized, as soon as possible. I would like to \r\ncommend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on having \r\nmade resolving the Darfur conflict a priority, as well as \r\non his visit to the Sudan. It is in that context that I \r\nreaffirm our support for the peacebuilding and \r\npeacekeeping efforts of the United Nations. \r\n Hungary welcomes the fact that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has started its work and has \r\nmet in a country-specific format to consider the cases \r\nof Burundi and Sierra Leone. We look forward to the \r\nfirst report on its work. We consider the Commission to \r\nbe an important instrument to enhance the capabilities \r\nof the United Nations to support countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict. \r\n We are fully aware of the need to strengthen the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to mount and sustain \r\ncomplex and multidimensional peacekeeping \r\noperations. Hungary commends the efforts made by the \r\nSecretary-General to achieve that purpose and \r\nwelcomes the General Assembly’s decision to establish \r\nthe Department of Field Support. My country’s track \r\nrecord in the field of peacekeeping demonstrates that \r\nwe are willing to actively support the Security \r\nCouncil’s decisions. Hungarian military and police \r\npersonnel are present in many of the peacekeeping \r\nmissions of the United Nations, namely, in Cyprus, \r\nGeorgia, Kosovo, Lebanon and Western Sahara. \r\n My recent participation at the fifty-first General \r\nConference of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) and my talks with Director General Mohamed \r\nElBaradei reaffirmed my conviction that questions \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 14 \r\n \r\nrelating to nuclear safety and non-proliferation should \r\nremain high on our agenda. \r\n Hungary shares the concerns of the international \r\ncommunity over Iran’s nuclear programme. We deplore \r\nIran’s failure to take the steps required by the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors and by Security Council \r\nresolutions, steps necessary to re-establish \r\ninternational confidence in the peaceful nature of its \r\nnuclear programme. We welcomed the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747 \r\n(2007), and we fully comply with the obligations set \r\nforth therein. We hope that Iran will soon realize that a \r\ndiplomatic and negotiated solution is possible and that \r\ncompliance has many benefits. \r\n Hungary continues to support the process aimed \r\nat achieving the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula in a peaceful manner and welcomes the first \r\npromising results of the Six-Party Talks. Developments \r\nrelated to the North Korean nuclear issue have \r\nunderscored the importance of the early entry into \r\nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \r\n Hungary supports all multilateral, regional and \r\nbilateral efforts that contribute in an effective manner \r\nto our common goal of achieving disarmament and \r\ncurbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nSuch efforts must also aim at upholding and \r\nstrengthening key international treaties and export \r\ncontrol regimes. In that context, one of the most \r\nimportant challenges is to ensure compliance with the \r\nTreaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nMoreover, Hungary welcomes the entry into force of \r\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of \r\nActs of Nuclear Terrorism, which we ratified in April. \r\n An urgent issue in the field of counter-terrorism \r\nis the full and earliest possible implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In \r\nthat regard, the main responsibility lies with Member \r\nStates, which should all also actively participate in the \r\nupcoming implementation review. The conclusion of a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\nremains another high priority for Hungary. \r\n Fifteen years after the United Nations Conference \r\non Environment and Development, the Rio Summit, it \r\nis evident that, at the current pace, our efforts will not \r\nbe sufficient to halt the emerging global threats, in \r\nparticular that of climate change. The European Union \r\nhas a clear position in that regard, and it has proposed \r\nto speed up the drafting of a new global compact. As a \r\nmember of the EU, Hungary fully agrees with the \r\nurgency of the matter. We hope that the ongoing \r\ndeliberations on the future of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and of the \r\nKyoto Protocol will lead to concrete results within two \r\nyears. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome \r\nthe efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to \r\nraise awareness about climate change in the \r\ninternational community. \r\n On behalf of my country, I would like to reiterate \r\nHungary’s commitment to upholding the rule of \r\ninternational law, to giving priority to effective \r\nmultilateralism, to spreading the culture of cooperation \r\nand the peaceful settlement of international disputes, \r\nand to making every effort to preserve a sustainable \r\nenvironment for future generations. \r\n In conclusion, Hungary is strongly committed to \r\nworking with you, Mr. President, during the sixty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly to achieve the \r\nobjectives set out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mourad Medelci, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nAlgeria. \r\n Mr. Medelci (Algeria) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe particular pleasure of conveying to you, Sir, my \r\nsincere congratulations on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. This attests to the esteem and trust enjoyed by \r\nyour country. Your unanimous election to your high \r\noffice is also recognition of your ability and your \r\nwealth of experience as a talented academic and \r\ndiplomat, which we believe will ensure success in the \r\nwork of this session. I assure you of my delegation’s \r\nsupport and its full readiness to assist you in carrying \r\nout your lofty mission. \r\n I should also like to thank Her Excellency \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her commendable \r\nefforts throughout the entirety of the previous session \r\nof the General Assembly. The measures she took are a \r\nfurther step towards modernizing the United Nations \r\nand improving its effectiveness. \r\n I would also like to express our sincere gratitude \r\nto Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to tell him how pleased we \r\nare to see him participating in the work of the General \r\nAssembly as Secretary-General. By unanimously \r\nelecting him to lead the Organization, we have \r\ndemonstrated our confidence in his ability to continue \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n15 07-52299 \r\n \r\nthe work of reforming the United Nations begun by his \r\npredecessor with a view to making the Organization an \r\neffective tool in achieving the noble objectives of \r\npromoting peace and development throughout the \r\nworld. We should continue to support him in realizing \r\nthat enormous and ambitious undertaking. \r\n Gathered here at the General Assembly two years \r\nago for the World Summit, our heads of State or \r\nGovernment took historic decisions for the future of \r\nthe United Nations. Although we are pleased with the \r\nprogress made to date, there is still a long way to go in \r\nachieving all the goals set at the Summit. Efforts must \r\nstill be made to find the most appropriate response to \r\nthe serious threat posed by climate change, which was \r\nthe subject of discussion last week; achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism, \r\nwhich has still not been agreed; strengthening United \r\nNations system-wide coherence; and reforming the \r\nSecurity Council, without which the overall reform \r\nprocess will remain incomplete. Algeria, which has \r\nalways called for thorough and comprehensives reform \r\nof the Organization, continues to believe that decisive \r\ncommitment and the widest possible endorsement by \r\nMember States are crucial to achieving the fruitful \r\nconsensus to bring about a positive outcome of this \r\nambitious reform effort. \r\n The world today faces new types of destabilizing \r\nfactors and numerous threats that jeopardize \r\ninternational peace and security. That is especially the \r\ncase with regard to terrorism, which is by definition a \r\nthreat to the basic right to life. It spares no region of \r\nthe world and makes no distinction as to race, gender \r\nor religion. It therefore requires resolute international \r\nmobilization and a collective and decisive response \r\nbased on solidarity from the international community. \r\nOnly in that way can we ensure the effectiveness and \r\nsustainability of the effort. \r\n My country has long suffered from heinous \r\nterrorism, which we have fought on our own and for \r\nwhich we paid a great price due to the indifference of \r\nthe international community in the 1990s. We therefore \r\nappreciate the daily growing awareness of the dangers \r\nposed by that phenomenon and of the need to prevent \r\nand eradicate it. In that regard, Algeria supported the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \r\nwhich was adopted by the General Assembly in \r\nSeptember 2006 as resolution 60/288. We call for a \r\ncommitment by Member States to implement it \r\nimmediately. We would like to point out, however, that \r\nthe fight against terrorism should not be waged solely \r\nthrough the use of force but should also entail \r\naddressing the underlying causes of the phenomenon, \r\nin particular by finding just and equitable solutions to \r\nconflicts, especially the conflict in the Middle East.  \r\n In addition to expeditious measures to thwart this \r\ndevastating phenomenon, it is also urgent to conclude a \r\ncomprehensive convention against international \r\nterrorism that includes a clear definition of the concept \r\nof terrorism. Such a convention should also clearly \r\nde-link terrorism from the legitimate struggle of \r\npeoples against occupation. It should also not equate \r\nterrorism with any religion, civilization or geographic \r\nregion. \r\n In a world torn by conflict and tormented by \r\nextremism and intolerance of all sorts, it is essential \r\ntoday that we work to calm hearts and minds in order \r\nto promote a productive dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations, so as to dispel misunderstanding, \r\neliminate prejudices and stereotypes and strengthen \r\nmutual understanding. With patience, determination \r\nand solidarity, we should dispel all theories and \r\nassociations that promote the dangerous discourse of a \r\nclash of civilizations. \r\n We have great hopes for the General Assembly’s \r\nforthcoming High-Level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace. \r\nWe hope that the dialogue will serve to bring \r\nrationality to debates surrounding this issue, in line \r\nwith the ambitious efforts of the Alliance of \r\nCivilization. Algeria is pleased at the particular \r\nattention given to this issue, including the appointment \r\nof Mr. Jorge Sampaio as High Representative for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations. We will spare no effort to \r\npromote this approach, which is more crucial than ever, \r\nto achieve a productive dialogue among civilizations \r\nthat makes it possible for us to address such common \r\nchallenges as underdevelopment, ignorance, poverty, \r\nracism and extremism.  \r\n Despite the Organization’s laudable efforts, the \r\ntask of decolonization remains unfinished. I would like \r\nto refer in particular to Western Sahara, which is the \r\nlast case of decolonization in Africa. Its people are still \r\ndeprived the right to self-determination enshrined in \r\nthe relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. The international community had \r\nharboured genuine hope for a just and lasting \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 16 \r\n \r\nresolution of the conflict, especially in the wake of the \r\nSecurity Council’s unanimous support for the peace \r\nplan proposed by Mr. James Baker, former Personal \r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General — a plan that \r\nresolution 1495 (2003) rightly referred to as an \r\n“optimum political solution” (para. 1).  \r\n We are resolutely committed to the search for a \r\npeaceful solution under international law. Algeria \r\nwelcomed the adoption on 30 April 2007 of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1754 (2007), which clearly \r\nemphasized the need to find a just and lasting political \r\nsolution which will provide for the right of self-\r\ndetermination of the Saharawi people. We hope that the \r\nnegotiations that began in June and resumed in August \r\nat New York will continue, in order to allow the two \r\nparties — Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO — to \r\nreach an agreement in line with international law that \r\nmakes it possible for the people of Western Sahara to \r\ndecide their own fate freely and without constraints in \r\na referendum on self-determination. \r\n Other tragedies are taking place in Africa: \r\nfratricidal wars, pandemics and natural disasters. This \r\ntragic situation only serves to push countries with \r\nlimited resources into a precarious situation that \r\ndiminishes the possibility of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment of any kind. \r\n Although, from its inception in 2004 the Peace \r\nand Security Council of the African Union (AU) has \r\nbeen providing appropriate African solutions to \r\nconflicts on the continent, and as commendable as \r\nthose have been, its efforts will not be effective \r\nwithout the firm commitment and considerable \r\nsustained assistance of the entire international \r\ncommunity — such as the tremendous efforts made \r\nrecently to resolve the crisis in Darfur. Effectively \r\naddressing the multidimensional problems involving \r\npeace, security and development faced by the continent \r\ntoday also requires that the international community \r\nsupport the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD), which is a viable vehicle to address Africa’s \r\nsocio-economic concerns. \r\n In the Middle East, which is another especially \r\nunstable part of the world, the situation is \r\ndeteriorating. This is reflected in daily violence and \r\nrecurring crises. If we are not vigilant, that situation \r\nthreatens to undermine any hope of establishing lasting \r\npeace in the region. The international community must \r\nonce again become more involved in order to establish \r\na just and lasting peace in the Middle East that is based \r\non the implementation of the Road Map and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. In that regard, Algeria welcomes the \r\nrenewed attention being given to the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, as reflected in President Bush’s proposal to \r\nhold an international peace conference this fall. The \r\ninternational community should support that effort, \r\nwhich has rekindled hope for a comprehensive \r\nresolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, in order to avert \r\nfailure, which would have enormous consequences for \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n The situation in Iraq also continues to be of \r\nconcern. That fraternal country is experiencing scenes \r\nof deadly violence on a daily basis. Sectarian and \r\ncommunal violence also prevails throughout the \r\ncountry, which undermine the values of citizenship and \r\ncoexistence among the children of a single people. \r\nThose events appeal to our collective conscience and \r\ncall on us to mobilize assistance to that country by \r\nmaking our contribution to finding a solution that \r\npreserves Iraq’s national unity, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. \r\n I should also like to express my country’s \r\nconcern about the current impasse in the multilateral \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation process: the failure \r\nof the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) \r\nheld in May 2005 and the impasse at the 2005 World \r\nSummit on this issue. This is a matter that calls on us \r\nto act, for it is of crucial importance to the future of \r\nhumankind. My country continues to believe that \r\ncomplying with the NPT entails the comprehensive and \r\nequitable implementation of all its provisions, ensuring \r\na balance between the rights and obligations of States \r\nparties. The three fundamental pillars of the Treaty \r\nmust be inseparable and complementary. Moreover, the \r\ngoal of preventing nuclear proliferation should not be a \r\npretext for preventing developing countries from \r\nhaving access to nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes. \r\n On the basis of that deeply held belief, on \r\n9 January 2007 Algeria was host to the first African \r\nhigh-level regional conference on the theme of nuclear \r\nenergy’s contribution to peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The goal was to translate into action the \r\ncommon African concern to ensure that nuclear energy \r\nserves to promote peace and sustainable development \r\non the continent.  \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n17 07-52299 \r\n \r\n The issue of development has always been at the \r\ncore of the international community’s concerns. In that \r\nregard, it is extremely important that it continue to be a \r\nvery high priority for the Organization. In the light of \r\nthe September 2000 Millennium Summit and the \r\nfollow-up meetings held both under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations and outside the system, it is clear that \r\nthe issue of development has become one of the major \r\nchallenges — such as peace, with which it is \r\ninextricably linked — that the international community \r\nmust address. In that connection, African heads of \r\nState, who launched NEPAD, and the leaders of the \r\nGroup of Eight (G8) met last June at Heiligendamm, \r\nGermany, and took up the issue of peace and \r\ndevelopment in Africa as part of the agenda of that \r\nmeeting. My country welcomes the decision taken by \r\nthe G8 to provide $60 billion in assistance to combat \r\nAIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other pandemics in \r\nAfrica.  \r\n Implementing that decision — and the progress \r\nmade in other areas, such as in effectively liberalizing \r\ninternational trade — should be important steps \r\ntowards achieving the development goals set by the \r\ninternational community. To that end, we believe that it \r\nis essential that the entire international community — \r\nand developed countries in particular — becomes more \r\ninvolved and honour the commitments undertaken at \r\nthe 2000 Millennium Summit, the 2002 Monterrey \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit \r\non Sustainable Development and the 2005 World \r\nSummit. \r\n In that regard, we are pleased to note that there \r\nwere a number of encouraging signs during the high-\r\nlevel dialogue on climate change held at the United \r\nNations last week. That illustrates that there is now a \r\ncollective awareness of the reality of the threat to \r\nhumankind posed by climate change and of its \r\ncorrelation with the issue of development. In that \r\nconnection, I would like to emphasize the central role \r\nthat should be played by the United Nations in carrying \r\nout negotiations in advance of the Conference of States \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, which is to be held in Bali, so as to \r\nensure that the meeting produces a global regime to \r\nreplace the Kyoto Protocol upon its expiry, in 2012. \r\nThat regime should include an emissions reduction \r\nstrategy that is fair, effective and equitable and based \r\non the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. In essence, it is a matter of \r\nsafeguarding the interests of developing countries, \r\nespecially African countries, which pollute the least but \r\nare the most exposed to the effects of climate change. \r\n We are determined to continue our active \r\nparticipation in the international effort to protect the \r\nenvironment. Algeria has made its energy strategy part \r\nof its sustainable development policy by deciding to \r\npromote renewable sources of energy.  \r\n I am also pleased to note that, on 5 June 2006, \r\nAlgeria had the distinct honour of hosting the \r\nfestivities for World Environment Day. In addition, \r\nfrom 17 to 19 December 2006, we hosted the Joint \r\nInternational Conference on Desertification, which was \r\nheld to mark the end of the International Year of \r\nDeserts and Desertification, an issue which is linked to \r\nthat of climate change. \r\n Algeria has embraced the Millennium Declaration \r\nand has spared no effort to take concrete steps through \r\nits national development policies. We are also working \r\nwithin the context of NEPAD to promote all efforts that \r\nwill contribute to development on the African \r\ncontinent.  \r\n Consolidating domestic reforms by strengthening \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law as important elements of \r\ngood governance stems from our desire to modernize \r\nour country, economy and society. In that vein, Algeria \r\nhas voluntarily agreed to peer review under the African \r\nevaluation Mechanism established for that purpose. \r\nThat undertaking is part of Africa’s efforts to \r\ncontribute concretely to strengthening good \r\ngovernance in every country of Africa, and in the \r\ncontinent as a whole.  \r\n A report was presented to heads of States \r\nmembers of the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\nmeeting at Accra in June 2007. Among other things, \r\nthe report underscored Algeria’s great socio-economic \r\nprogress. It also welcomed the steps that have been \r\ntaken to achieve national reconciliation, which were \r\nthe result of a courageous and visionary political \r\ndecision taken by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika that \r\nhas now been realized through a popular referendum \r\nthat reaffirmed a very broad-based desire for \r\nreconciliation. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to point out that in 2005, \r\nwhen we commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nfounding of the United Nations, we charted a course to \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 18 \r\n \r\nundertake genuine reorganization in the architecture of \r\ninternational relations by adapting the Organization to \r\nthe world we live in today. Only an Organization that is \r\neffective, just and credible will be able to meet the \r\ndemands brought about by change and to rise to the \r\nchallenges produced by the turbulence of today’s world \r\nin order to ensure peace, security and development for \r\nfuture generations. That is Algeria’s firm conviction, as \r\nwell as that of the entire international community. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Aboubakr A. Al-Qirbi, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Yemen. \r\n Mr. Al-Qirbi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. I am confident that, with your \r\nwisdom and experience, you will lead our work to \r\nsuccess. I wish you every success. I also wish to \r\ncommend Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-\r\nKhalifa, from the sisterly Kingdom of Bahrain, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, for all her constructive and concrete efforts to \r\nensure the success and positive results of the \r\nAssembly’s work. \r\n The sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly coincides with the sixtieth anniversary of my \r\ncountry’s joining the United Nations, on 30 September \r\n1947. The Republic of Yemen was one of the first \r\ncountries to realize the importance of participating and \r\ninteracting in an international forum that serves noble \r\nhuman objectives, the reason for which this \r\nOrganization was established. We also became aware \r\nof the role of the United Nations in safeguarding \r\ninternational peace and security and in promoting \r\ncooperation among Member States with the aim of \r\nachieving prosperity for all societies. \r\n On this occasion, I cannot fail to refer to the \r\ntransformations that the Republic of Yemen has \r\nundergone since its inception on 22 May 1990, be it in \r\nhuman development, freedoms, democracy or \r\nprotection of human rights. However, during the past \r\ntwo years in particular we have had significant success \r\nin establishing good governance and enlisting popular \r\nparticipation in local council elections, and we have \r\nembarked on an integrated ambitious programme for \r\neconomic, political, social, judicial and administrative \r\nreform. This has come to be known as the National \r\nReform Agenda. \r\n The presidential and local elections held in \r\nSeptember 2006, the transparency and fairness of \r\nwhich were attested to by all international observers, \r\nare evidence of the practice of democracy, freedom of \r\nexpression, peaceful change of government, political \r\npluralism, and decentralization in the management of \r\nState affairs. Yemen has also granted local councils \r\nbroad authority. Several pieces of legislation to combat \r\ncorruption were passed by the Yemeni Parliament, \r\nincluding the establishment of a Supreme Anti-\r\nCorruption Commission. They deal with procurement, \r\ntenders and bidding, and the establishment of an \r\nindependent Commission, financial disclosure for \r\npublic servants and basic reform in the judiciary. The \r\nGovernment now seeks to amend the laws that govern \r\nthe press in order to remove all constraints. \r\n Yemen has acceded to several international \r\nagreements relating to the fight against corruption, \r\nincluding the initiative of international transparency in \r\nthe mining and extraction industry sector. \r\n Today the world is witnessing political changes in \r\nYemen: freedom of expression and of demonstration \r\nfor its citizens, accorded to them by the constitution \r\nand by law. Even though some people have used these \r\nfreedoms to cause anarchy and violence, the \r\nGovernment has dealt with them in consonance with \r\nthe constitution and the law. \r\n I reiterate that my country abides by the approach \r\nthat it decreed for itself: democracy, political \r\npluralism, peaceful change of authority and recourse to \r\nthe ballot box as the best and only way for change. It is \r\nworth recalling here that the Government of Yemen has \r\ndeclared its intention to amend the constitution so as to \r\nreduce the presidential term of office from seven to \r\nfive years and the term of office of Parliament \r\nmembers from six to four years. It also intends to \r\namend the law pertaining to local administration, so \r\nthat governors would be elected directly, and to turn \r\nlocal administration into local government, so that \r\nmore decentralization and participation in governance \r\ncan be realized. \r\n As it moves along this path, Yemen faces several \r\nchallenges in the areas of development, poverty and \r\nunemployment. These challenges compel Yemen to call \r\non other States and on international organizations to \r\nhelp it overcome obstacles and to increase their \r\ndevelopment aid to Yemen, especially as the per capita \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n19 07-52299 \r\n \r\nassistance provided to the Yemeni individual does not \r\nmeet the internationally accepted standard. \r\n No one today questions the existence of global \r\nwarming, the results of climate change that the world is \r\nexperiencing, or the damage that is being inflicted on \r\nthe environment. Hence, it is only natural to stress that \r\nwe should all assume our common responsibility to \r\ncontain the damage caused by some wrong-headed \r\npolicies and practices, given that the devastating \r\neffects of such policies are evident to each and every \r\none of us. Over the past year we have seen floods, \r\nhurricanes and global warming in many regions of the \r\nworld. The future has in store more catastrophes that \r\nmay affect or wipe out millions of people, especially in \r\nthe third world. Consequently, the poor would continue \r\nto pay for the luxuries of the rich. \r\n We would like to recall all the agreements \r\nrelative to the environment and the resolutions that \r\nhave been adopted at conferences to protect it. We \r\nshould therefore seek to contain the climatic changes \r\nthat result in desertification and flooding. \r\n The tense situation in the Palestinian territories \r\nand the violence the Palestinian people are facing from \r\nthe Israelis are matters that run contrary to the \r\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter, international \r\nlaw, international agreements, the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention. While the Arabs in the past have been \r\ncriticized for not providing an Arab vision to put an \r\nend to the Arab-Israeli conflict, they were indeed \r\nsurprised that, when they presented their own Arab \r\nPeace Initiative, it was totally ignored by Israel and the \r\ninternational community, in spite of all the elements \r\nthat would secure a comprehensive and just solution to \r\nthe conflict. Thus, it is our hope that the Arab follow-\r\nup committee of the Arab initiative will have created a \r\npositive atmosphere leading to an international \r\nconference to be held under international supervision \r\nto achieve peace in the Middle East. It is also our hope \r\nthat the United States of America will keep its promise \r\nregarding the establishment of the Palestinian State on \r\nnational soil, with Holy Jerusalem as its capital, based \r\non the principles of total sovereignty, viability, and \r\nreturn of refugees; and we hope that the solution will \r\nbe widened to include total Israeli withdrawal from the \r\nGolan and the Sheba’a farms. We emphasize the \r\nimportance of the participation of all the parties \r\nconcerned in the international conference to be held \r\nsoon. \r\n On this occasion, we call on our Palestinian \r\nbrothers to return to dialogue, to unite their positions, \r\nto abide by the Arab Peace Initiative, to reorganize the \r\nPalestinian house in accordance with the constitution \r\nand Palestinian legitimacy. I refer here to the recent \r\nYemeni initiative to bring the Palestinian factions \r\ntogether to serve the unity and ambitions of the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\n The Republic of Yemen welcomes Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1770 (2007) on Iraq. From this \r\nrostrum it calls on the international community to stand \r\nwith the elected Iraqi Government to extend its \r\nauthority, to put an end to sectarian violence, to control \r\nall the armed militias and to face the terrorist elements \r\nthat seek to spread anarchy and undermine legitimate \r\nresistance and efforts at national reconciliation. We \r\nemphasize the necessity for dialogue among all the \r\nnational groups in Iraq in order to reach a common \r\nvision that could restore Iraq’s security and stability \r\nand its pioneering role in the region. The Republic of \r\nYemen calls on everyone to stop interfering in the \r\ninternal affairs of Iraq, to respect its unity and Arab \r\ncharacter, to put an end to the occupation of its lands \r\nand to reject any plan to divide it. \r\n Regarding the Sudan, we welcome its \r\nGovernment’s acceptance of an expansion of the forces \r\nand mandate of the African Union-United Nations \r\nHybrid Operation in Darfur. We support the efforts of \r\nthe Sudanese Government to restore peace in that \r\nregion in accordance with the security plan presented \r\nby the Security Council, provided that the sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity and unity of the Sudan will never be \r\njeopardized under any pretext.  \r\n The Republic of Yemen blesses the reconciliation \r\nagreement signed by the Somali factions in the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, which came about as a \r\nresult of African, Arab and international efforts. Yemen \r\ncalls on all international actors to provide further \r\nassistance and support to the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment in a manner that would enable it to rebuild \r\nSomalia. We emphasize the importance of providing \r\nenough African peacekeeping forces to stabilize and \r\nnormalize the security situation in Somalia. That would \r\nhasten the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces. As has \r\nalways been the case, the Republic of Yemen will \r\nremain a partner in the reconciliation process, \r\nsupporting all the parties, rejecting any foreign \r\nintervention in Somalia and emphasizing the need for \r\nreconstruction in Somalia, with a view to enabling the \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 20 \r\n \r\nTransitional Federal Government to rebuild State \r\ninstitutions. \r\n The Republic of Yemen emphasizes the right of \r\ncountries to possess nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes. It continues to support a special General \r\nAssembly declaration of the Middle East as a zone free \r\nfrom all nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, and resolutions demanding that Israel \r\nabide by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), in order to guarantee the \r\nstability of the region and to prevent a nuclear arms \r\nrace there. \r\n The Republic of Yemen emphasizes the \r\nimportance of achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), adopted in 2000. We also support the \r\nobjectives set out in the Monterrey Consensus. My \r\ncountry is convinced that the mobilization of financial \r\nresources for development and the effective use of \r\nthose resources in developing countries and countries \r\nin economic transition, are two crucial areas in which \r\ntrue international partnership should be encouraged. It \r\nis worth mentioning that the responsibility of creating \r\nand managing development programmes is first and \r\nforemost the responsibility of national Governments, in \r\naccordance with their priorities, needs and \r\nspecificities, and in keeping with international \r\nstrategies stemming from the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. This should take place in partnership with donor \r\ncountries and international organizations, and in \r\naccordance with national goals and programmes \r\ndevoted to human development.  \r\n The Republic of Yemen wants the human being to \r\nbe the centre and goal of its development and has \r\nplaced the MDGs high among the priorities of its \r\npolicies and its five-year development plan for the \r\nperiod 2006-2010. It has strenuously sought to take the \r\nsocial, economic and environmental dimensions of \r\ndevelopment into consideration. It has also involved \r\ncivil society organizations in implementing these \r\nstrategies. In addition, my country is working with \r\ndonor countries, international specialized agencies and \r\nother institutions to implement our third five-year plan, \r\nwith the objective of alleviating poverty by supporting \r\nsmall-scale programmes, expanding technical \r\neducation, enabling women, providing investment \r\nservices and opportunities and strengthening good \r\ngovernance. This is an ambitious plan that requires \r\ninternational support if it is to fully achieve its \r\nobjectives of bringing about a qualitative change in \r\nhuman development in Yemen.  \r\n There have been difficulties, however, in the \r\nimplementation of this ambitious reform programme, \r\nincluding frequent increases in the price of food stuffs, \r\nsuch as wheat flour, which has affected the standard of \r\nliving of Yemeni citizens, placing increasingly heavy \r\nburdens on them. Accordingly, it is incumbent on rich \r\nStates to consider how to deal with inflation in \r\ninternational markets, so that countries’ efforts to \r\nimplement their reform programmes will not be \r\njeopardized and so that those countries can strike a \r\nbalance between the costs of reform on the one hand \r\nand living standards, social peace and political stability \r\non the other.  \r\n In conclusion, allow me to express on behalf of \r\nthe Government of the Republic of Yemen our deep \r\nthanks to the Secretary-General, His Excellency  \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his sincere and strenuous efforts \r\nat the helm of the Organization. We are confident that \r\nhe is capable of leading it with a view to bringing \r\nabout justice and fulfilling the principles and values of \r\nthe United Nations to which we all aspire. We look \r\nforward to his continued leadership, especially in the \r\nsearch for a just and comprehensive peace in the \r\nMiddle East.  \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency  \r\nMr. Pranab Mukherjee, Minister for External Affairs of \r\nIndia. \r\n Mr. Mukherjee (India): Kindly accept my \r\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \r\nMy delegation assures you of its full cooperation as we \r\naddress issues identified in the annual report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/62/1) and as we responsibly and \r\ncreatively move forward with pending reforms of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n At the outset I would like to express India’s deep \r\ngratitude to all Member States for the recent \r\nunanimous adoption by the General Assembly of \r\nresolution 61/271, deciding to annually observe the \r\nInternational Day of Non-Violence, on 2 October, the \r\nanniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. I also \r\nlook forward to participation by Member States in the \r\ninformal plenary meeting of the General Assembly and \r\nother functions being organized tomorrow at the United \r\nNations to mark the first International Day of \r\nNon-Violence. \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n21 07-52299 \r\n \r\n A central topic for this year’s debate — \r\nresponding to climate change — is both timely and \r\nrelevant. India’s views on it were recently set forth at \r\nthe high-level event on climate change, which took \r\nplace here on 24 September. Combined with the \r\nexchange of views in the general debate, it will no \r\ndoubt provide a useful backdrop to the meeting of the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange to be held later this year in Bali, Indonesia.  \r\n The impact of climate change and environmental \r\ndegradation falls disproportionately upon developing \r\ncountries. Developing countries are the most \r\nvulnerable to it, and also lack the means to tackle it. \r\nMeasures to address climate change must be based on \r\nmitigation and adaptation strategies with fair burden-\r\nsharing and measures to realize sustainable patterns of \r\nconsumption and production. The process of burden-\r\nsharing must also take into account where the primary \r\nresponsibility for the present state of greenhouse gas \r\nconcentration in the atmosphere rests and not foreclose \r\nrapid and sustained economic development for the \r\ndeveloping world, which, in any case, is an imperative \r\nfor adaptation. \r\n Technology is the other key area that needs to be \r\naddressed. It is important that critical clean \r\ntechnologies be made available and affordable to \r\ndeveloping countries. The intellectual property rights \r\nregime must balance rewards for innovators with the \r\ncommon good of humankind. Concerted international \r\naction to address climate change, in accordance with \r\nthe principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as \r\nnational circumstances and social and economic \r\nconditions, is the need of the hour. India, for which \r\nenergy security is a national imperative, has a very \r\nsmall individual carbon footprint, with per capita \r\ncarbon dioxide emissions at just about a quarter of the \r\nworld’s average. Even so, we are determined that, as \r\nwe pursue economic growth, our per capita greenhouse \r\ngas emissions will not increase beyond those of the \r\nindustrial countries. \r\n Poverty and underdevelopment are amongst the \r\ncentral challenges of our times. The overarching \r\nrequirement is for sustained economic growth to \r\neradicate poverty in developing countries. However, \r\neconomic growth must also be measured against the \r\ntemplate of social inclusion. Growth alone is not \r\nenough if it does not produce benefits that are \r\nsufficiently dispersed, not only in terms of increased \r\nincome and employment, but also for improved health, \r\nnutrition and education for all. \r\n I affirm India’s resolve to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Government \r\nof India accords the highest priority to inclusive \r\ngrowth, including the political, legal, educational and \r\neconomic empowerment of women, effective and \r\naffordable public health, and enhanced access to \r\neducational opportunities, especially for all those who \r\nare disadvantaged. \r\n It is apparent that progress in the achievement of \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals has been \r\ntardy. The international community, through the United \r\nNations system, must more effectively support the \r\nefforts of developing countries to achieve the \r\ndevelopment goals. A comprehensive reform of the \r\ninternational financial architecture is a key ingredient \r\nin that process. The United Nations must play an \r\nimportant role in overseeing the reform of the \r\ninternational financial architecture. That should include \r\nmeasures to ensure a greater voice for and participation \r\nby developing countries in the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. The process of reform must be carried to \r\nits logical conclusion if the credibility of those \r\ninstitutions is to be enhanced. \r\n We must also address as a priority the regrettable \r\ninversion of global resource flows. Today, instead of \r\nthe urgently needed inflow of resources to developing \r\ncountries to buttress their national economic \r\ndevelopment plans, we are confronted with a net \r\noutflow from them. Official development assistance \r\n(ODA) showed a marked fall during 2006 and remains \r\nwell below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nproduct. It is primarily being used to finance debt \r\nrelief. That this is happening after so many years of \r\nliberalization and globalization highlights our \r\ncollective failure. Perhaps we should be considering \r\nmechanisms, such as an international debt commission, \r\nto redress the problem of developing country debt.  \r\n The least developed countries, which are \r\nparticularly hard hit by rising energy costs, find \r\nthemselves in an even more difficult situation. \r\nEnhanced and predictable resource flow to developing \r\ncountries remains a key objective of the global \r\npartnership for development. India will continue to do \r\nwhat it can to help with capacity-building in other \r\ndeveloping countries and to assist them through ODA \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 22 \r\n \r\nwithin the limits of its capacity. By the end of the year, \r\nimports from least developed countries into India will \r\nface a zero-tariff regime. \r\n Early and substantive progress at the Doha Round \r\nof trade negotiations, based on the primacy of the \r\ndevelopment dimension, is another imperative. We \r\nmust return to the negotiating table with a redoubled \r\nsense of urgency, while recognizing that adherence to \r\nthe existing mandate remains critical. Nor can the \r\ninterests of subsistence farmers be ignored or equated \r\nwith those of other sectors. An illogical linkage \r\nbetween agriculture and non-agricultural market access \r\nwill only complicate the development impact of the \r\nRound. The overarching principle of special and \r\ndifferential treatment for developing countries remains \r\na categorical imperative. \r\n As part of India’s commitment to the \r\nachievement of human rights for all, and as a member \r\nof the Human Rights Council, we remain actively \r\ninvolved in developing the institutional framework of \r\nthat body, including the universal periodic review \r\nmechanism, based on effective international \r\ncooperation as a central principle in the Council’s \r\nmethods of work. India will work towards developing \r\nan international normative framework for the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. India is \r\nhonoured to be one of the first signatories of the \r\nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearance. Earlier today, I \r\nalso had the honour of depositing India’s instrument of \r\nratification of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities.  \r\n As the largest democracy in the world, India has \r\ndeveloped a system of local self-government with \r\ndemocratically elected institutions of representative \r\nGovernment at all levels — the village, the district, the \r\nState and the nation. The effort to make participatory \r\ndemocracy more meaningful to every Indian citizen \r\nunderpins what is perhaps one of the greatest social \r\nexperiments in the world today, namely, the transfer of \r\ndecision-making power to nearly one million elected \r\nwomen local Government representatives. As a result, \r\nwomen are not merely the beneficiaries of change in \r\nIndia, but are its instruments. \r\n As the world’s largest democracy, it was also \r\nnatural for India to support the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund. We made an initial \r\ncontribution of $10 million to the Fund and remain \r\nactively and constructively involved in realizing the \r\nobjectives for which it was set up. As a small token of \r\nour commitment to that laudable initiative, I have the \r\nprivilege of announcing a further pledge of $10 million \r\nto the United Nations Democracy Fund. \r\n The international system cannot be reordered \r\nmeaningfully without a comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. If the Organization is to remain the \r\ncornerstone of the international architecture in this \r\ncentury, it cannot remain mired in the realities of the \r\n1940s. Despite substantive implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations reform agenda that emerged from the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome, such reform will \r\ninevitably remain incomplete without comprehensive \r\nreform and expansion of the Security Council and \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Elements and \r\nideas on the reform of the Security Council have been \r\ndiscussed for well over a decade in numerous reports \r\nand interminable consultations. It is now time for \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to commence in order \r\nto make the Security Council more democratic, \r\nrepresentative and responsive.  \r\n We, together with partners from Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and Asia, tabled a resolution on 11 September \r\n2007, spelling out the principles on which reform \r\nought to be based if it is to be meaningful. These \r\nprinciples are expansion in both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories of membership; greater \r\nrepresentation for developing countries and \r\nrepresentation for developed countries that is reflective \r\nof contemporary world realities; and comprehensive \r\nimprovement in the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil, including ensuring greater access for island \r\nand small States. We welcome recent statements from \r\nthis podium by President Bush of the United States of \r\nAmerica and other world leaders on the need for \r\nSecurity Council reform in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. It is high time that we \r\ncollectively bring these ideas to implementation. \r\n Reform of the United Nations would also be \r\nincomplete without revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. The central goal of such revitalization must \r\nbe the restoration and enhancement of the role and \r\nauthority of the General Assembly as originally \r\nenvisaged in the Charter. \r\n Given the significance of developmental \r\nactivities for the developing world, India sees a \r\ncorresponding need for the reform of United Nations \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n23 07-52299 \r\n \r\noperational activities in favour of development. Since \r\nthese activities are aimed at supporting the work of \r\nMember States, it follows that Members must \r\ndetermine their direction and shape through an \r\nintergovernmental process. The litmus test for any \r\nreform proposal is whether it improves the support \r\nextended by the United Nations to the efforts of \r\nprogramme countries. India would therefore judge \r\nreform proposals by their impact on the ground, by the \r\nresultant improvement in the effectiveness of the \r\nsystem and by the impact on transaction costs for the \r\nUnited Nations development system. \r\n Steps to achieve the complete elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons have also only made limited headway. \r\nDespite some progress, the world remains far from \r\nachieving the objective of total elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons. India’s long-standing commitment to \r\nuniversal, non-discriminatory and comprehensive \r\nnuclear disarmament is embodied in the vision of late \r\nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-free and \r\nnon-violent world. This vision was put forward nearly \r\ntwo decades ago. It remains undiminished today.  \r\n Indeed, it is all the more relevant today, given the \r\nfact that peaceful uses of nuclear energy can address \r\nthe inexorably growing demand for new and  \r\nnon-polluting sources of energy to fuel economic \r\ndevelopment. We will be bringing proposals to \r\nMember States and this Organization to see how we \r\ncan refocus on general and complete disarmament, \r\nparticularly nuclear disarmament. Disarmament is our \r\nagreed goal, and it subsumes arms control and \r\nnon-proliferation. \r\n It is well known that India has an impeccable \r\nrecord in preventing the proliferation of sensitive \r\ntechnologies. That is in keeping with our commitment \r\nto being a responsible nuclear Power. India is ready to \r\nwork with the international community to develop a \r\nnew international consensus on non-proliferation. The \r\ninternational community needs to intensify the effort to \r\naddress the very real threat posed by the link between \r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\n(WMDs) and related materials and technologies and \r\nthe ability of non-State actors to acquire them. The risk \r\nposed by the intersection between proliferation and \r\nterrorism is real and serious. The central objective must \r\nbe to ensure that our solidarity in words is translated \r\ninto action. \r\n The adoption of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy last September was a \r\nnoteworthy development, signalling the will of the \r\ninternational community to combat this menace in a \r\nholistic and coordinated manner. Welcome as the \r\nStrategy is, there is much more that needs to be done to \r\ncombat the menace that international terrorism has \r\nbecome. India is convinced that without the early \r\nadoption of a comprehensive convention against \r\ninternational terrorism, the global struggle against \r\nterrorism remains incomplete and likely to succeed \r\nonly partially. We must ensure that there is zero \r\ntolerance for all forms of terrorism. \r\n In conclusion, I would express the hope that our \r\ndeliberations in the year ahead will lead us to \r\nenlightened action. With maturity and resolve we will \r\nsuccessfully overcome the many challenges before us. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency  \r\nMr. Patteson Oti, Minister for Foreign Affairs, External \r\nTrade and Immigration of Solomon Islands. \r\n Mr. Oti (Solomon Islands): Mr. President, I am \r\nprivileged to stand before you today in the place of my \r\nPrime Minister, Mr. Manasseh Sogavare, to renew the \r\nfirm commitment of the Government and the people of \r\nSolomon Islands to the principles, ideals and values \r\nthat gather us together here annually for their \r\nre-examination and reaffirmation. The privilege of \r\nmembership in the United Nations allows my country \r\nto sit amongst Member States and stand up for, as well \r\nas against, decisions on issues that either unite or \r\ndivide us. Belonging to this Organization for almost \r\nhalf the time it has existed is a proud feat for a country \r\nthat is barely 30 years old. The experience of nearly \r\nthree decades of sovereign statehood has taught \r\nSolomon Islands many lessons that we can share with \r\nthe rest of the world. In particular, we are well placed \r\nto highlight the fragility of our independence as a \r\nnation of peoples whose survival is both threatened and \r\nguaranteed by our interdependence with the \r\ninternational community as represented in this \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. President, representing my Prime Minister \r\nand addressing this Assembly on behalf of more than \r\nthe half a million people of Solomon Islands, I wish to \r\nbegin by congratulating you on your recent election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at our sixty-second \r\nsession. Both you and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon \r\nhave been selected by fate to pledge your devotion to \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 24 \r\n \r\nduty in a cause challenged by humanity’s survival. We \r\ntrust you to do what is right to attain the best for the \r\nrest of us. Your distinguished predecessors have paved \r\npathways for the progress of this Organization along \r\nmany routes which you must now travel to fulfil our \r\nCharter’s promises to us and those whom we are \r\nfortunate to represent. \r\n Mr. Jallow (Gambia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Much has happened in Solomon Islands since my \r\nPrime Minister’s address to this Assembly in \r\nSeptember last year. Turning firstly to cataclysmic \r\nevents, just six months ago, a series of earthquakes and \r\ntsunamis terrorized, devastated and swallowed up some \r\nof our islands, their inhabitants, homes, gardens, \r\nanimals and worldly possessions. From that \r\ncatastrophe alone, we suffered the loss of more than 50 \r\nlives and injury to countless more, the total destruction \r\nof over 3,240 homes and severe damage to another \r\n3,000 homes. The damage bill is estimated to exceed \r\n$100 million. Thanks to the instantly televised news \r\ncoverage of the devastation, the entire world was \r\nshown graphic evidence of the sinking of some of our \r\nislands, the elevation of submerged reefs 3 metres \r\nabove sea level and the submersion of many coastal \r\nlands.  \r\n Not visible at the time were the immediate and \r\nfuture effects of nature’s structural adjustments on the \r\ndaily livelihoods of Solomon Islanders. Traditional \r\nfishing grounds have shifted. Agricultural activities \r\nhave had to be relocated. The debris is slowly being \r\ncleared. The water supply is being restored. Roads, \r\nwharves and bridges are being rebuilt and hospitals, \r\nclinics, schools and houses are being repaired or \r\nreconstructed. Entire villages will need to be relocated \r\nand rebuilt. Life can no longer be the same for the vast \r\nmajority of our people in rural areas, who depend on \r\nfishing and subsistence agriculture for their daily \r\nsurvival. Any slight tremor or vibration causes them to \r\nflee to higher ground in panic. The emotional and \r\npsychological effects of nature’s non-negotiable terrors \r\nare what our people have to struggle with for the rest \r\nof their lives. \r\n My snapshot of the April earthquakes and \r\ntsunamis and of their aftermath would not be complete \r\nif I did not acknowledge and place on record the \r\neternal gratitude of Solomon Islands to all those \r\nGovernments, international organizations and peoples \r\nwho offered sympathy, prayers and a helping hand \r\nthrough the humanitarian relief that was dispatched to \r\nour affected areas. Without the assistance and \r\ninvolvement of all those who volunteered their time \r\nand resources and the generosity of those who donated \r\nemergency relief funds, supplies and provisions, my \r\nGovernment would not have progressed to the \r\nrehabilitation phase of the disaster recovery \r\nprogramme as fast as we have. It is at this time of \r\nsuffering and need that we appreciate the true value of \r\nhuman compassion and sacrifice. \r\n With the increasing incidence of disasters all over \r\nthe world, we must bolster the resources of the United \r\nNations humanitarian relief programme and its \r\ncapacity to respond rapidly and effectively to such \r\ncrises to alleviate human suffering. As much as we \r\nappreciate the quantum of funds pledged by \r\nsympathetic individuals, institutions and nation-States, \r\nwe are left to wonder whether the filtering of donor \r\nfinancial assistance through national charitable \r\norganizations is calculated to whittle down its value \r\nthrough the consumption of largesse in its delivery and \r\nadministration. Respecting the generosity and altruism \r\nof those who give and the desperation of those who \r\nneed requires that we enshrine the principles of \r\nefficiency and effectiveness to guide humanitarian \r\nrelief efforts across international borders. Human \r\ncharity and human suffering are done a disservice \r\nwhen disasters create “feeding frenzies” for \r\nnon-governmental charitable organizations. The recent \r\nexperience of Solomon Islands mirrors what many \r\nother nations have undergone and underlines the need \r\nfor concerted international action to regulate the \r\ncollection and delivery of humanitarian aid. \r\n Dealing with the effects of environmental \r\ncatastrophes rather than their causes takes us only half \r\nas far as we ought to go. The proceedings of last \r\nweek’s High-level Event on Climate Change have \r\nemboldened small island developing States to rally \r\ntogether to demand the intensification of international \r\nefforts to curb global environmental recklessness.  \r\n It appears that the fragility of States such as \r\nSolomon Islands has less to do with the quality of our \r\ngovernance machinery and more to do with our \r\necological vulnerability. My Government wonders: \r\nwhat is so virtuous about foreign aid when billions of \r\ndollars can be spent on improving the governance \r\nstructures of an economy that derives its export income \r\nfrom the destruction of tropical forests, when just a \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n25 07-52299 \r\n \r\nfraction of that expense is all that is needed to preserve \r\nour forests and finance our annual national budgets? \r\nSolomon Islands believes that the protection of our \r\nglobal environment is a matter of international \r\nresponsibility and that it can be capably addressed \r\nthrough the enunciation of principles that dictate \r\nreciprocal undertakings aimed at the continued \r\ngranting and receipt of foreign aid. \r\n I now turn to the ongoing disputes concerning the \r\nfuture occupation of Solomon Islands by the \r\nAustralian-led visiting contingent. My Government has \r\ninitiated a parliamentary review of the legislative basis \r\nfor the continued presence of the occupying police, \r\nmilitary and civilian personnel from our neighbouring \r\ncountries. Credit must, however, be given to the \r\nvisiting forces deployed in 2003 to restore law and \r\norder in Solomon Islands following many years of \r\nethnic rivalry and violence. The policing of the crisis \r\nfor four years has contained it on the surface, without \r\naddressing the underlying socio-cultural roots of \r\ndissension. My Government is determined to delve \r\ndeeper into the historical causes of the friction between \r\nour peoples and to do what is necessary to resolve the \r\ndisputes that prevent their reconciliation.  \r\n The Commission of Inquiry into the April 2006 \r\nCivil Unrest in Honiara — capital of Solomon \r\nIslands — whose establishment was announced by the \r\nPrime Minister during his most recent address to the \r\nAssembly (see A/61/PV.17), finally became functional \r\nthis year after the failure of externally orchestrated \r\nmanoeuvres to derail it. The Commission of Inquiry’s \r\ninterim reports have exposed major flaws in our \r\nnational security operations. My Government \r\nappreciates the support of and the financial assistance \r\npledged by Papua New Guinea in staffing the \r\nCommission of Inquiry. The Commission’s final report \r\nand recommendations should be available in the next \r\nfew months. \r\n Our people’s gratitude to Australia and New \r\nZealand for financing the deployment of their nationals \r\nto police our crisis with the help of a small contingent \r\nof personnel from neighbouring Pacific island nations \r\nis often expressed and is genuine. However, as our \r\nfellow Pacific island States can readily appreciate, our \r\nsovereign right to determine the terms under which the \r\nGovernment of Solomon Islands will permit our \r\ncontinued occupation by the visiting contingent cannot \r\nbe undermined by any Member of the United Nations.  \r\n The long neglect of our internal problem by the \r\nUnited Nations, followed by the hasty conclusion of \r\nthe regionally based multilateral agreement, which led \r\nto the dispatch of the initial visiting contingent of \r\nAustralian, New Zealand and other Pacific island \r\nforces, have caused the ongoing controversies \r\nconcerning their continued existence and eventual \r\nreturn to the Organization’s doorstep. Viewed from the \r\nperspective of Chapter VIII of the Charter, the nature \r\nof the arrangements and activities embraced by the \r\n2003 agreement, as well as their practical application \r\nand operation since that time, appear to transgress \r\nArticle 52 of the Charter as a result of apparent \r\ninconsistencies with Articles 1 and 2.  \r\n However disguised and rationalized, intervention \r\nand occupation allow assisting nations to spend and \r\nearn substantial revenue for their supporting businesses \r\nand industries. My Government is too nationalistic to \r\nbecome captive to the fortunes that justify our \r\nperpetual retention under a state of siege. My Prime \r\nMinister and my fellow ministers and parliamentarians \r\nremain unmoved by Australian resistance to our \r\nattempts to reclaim our sovereignty and independence.  \r\n In keeping with our obligations under Article 54, \r\nwe shall keep the Security Council fully informed of \r\nthe activities undertaken under the 2003 agreement and \r\nshall seek its assistance in reducing the financial \r\nburdens that Australia and New Zealand needlessly \r\nbear under the current arrangements. \r\n As members of the Assembly know only too well, \r\nthose who pay the piper call the tune. Our experience \r\nwith the Australian-designed cooperative intervention \r\npackage demonstrates the need for greater United \r\nNations involvement in the leadership of future \r\nregional peacekeeping operations. \r\n The impetus for Australia’s involvement in our \r\ninternal unrest was a dramatic change of focus and \r\nheart concerning the protection of its strategic interests \r\nin the Pacific region. The threat of terrorist penetration \r\nthrough porous frontiers is sufficient cause for \r\ninternational anxiety, insecurity and sometimes \r\nparanoia. Despite global condemnation of terrorism, \r\nthe struggle for consensus on an acceptable definition \r\nof terrorism retards the progress of multilateral \r\ninitiatives in the formulation of a comprehensive anti-\r\nterrorism convention. \r\n Illustrative of the potential for overreaction to \r\nterrorism is the indignity that I, as Foreign Minister of \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 26 \r\n \r\nSolomon Islands, had to suffer when my multiple-entry \r\nvisa to Australia was suddenly cancelled last year. The \r\nwritten explanation for that decision identified me as a \r\nrisk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian \r\ncommunity under Section 116 (1) (e) of its Migration \r\nAct. One would have to admit that that is an incredible \r\njustification for excluding democratically elected \r\nleaders of neighbouring countries not known for \r\nbreeding terrorists. Just over a century ago, many of \r\nour ancestors were kidnapped and forcibly taken to \r\nwork as labourers in a country that is now quick to \r\nregard their descendants as terrorists. Defining \r\nterrorism has proved to be more difficult than \r\ndeploring it. \r\n Moving from the preoccupations of the past year \r\nto our perennial protestations, Solomon Islands is \r\ncompelled by principle, rather than pragmatism, to \r\nventilate again our people’s concerns arising from the \r\nnon-representation of the Government and people of \r\nTaiwan in this Assembly. Our recent attempts to \r\nchannel Taiwan’s application for admission through the \r\nestablished gateways was resisted — without any \r\nregard for the legitimate quest of 23 million Taiwanese \r\npeople for self-determination — by fellow Member \r\nStates committed to upholding a peremptory rule of \r\ninternational law also enshrined in Article 1 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Organized international \r\nhypocrisy is the only basis for explaining the indignity \r\nthat the Taiwanese people must suffer at the hands of a \r\npowerful constellation of States interested only in the \r\nprotection of trade and investment and not any \r\nhumanitarian concerns. \r\n China’s assertion of sovereignty over Taiwan \r\nmust be the pretence that it invariably is, since most of \r\nits major trading partners have also forged and \r\nmaintain bilateral relations with Taiwan, which are \r\nultimately predicated on politico-juridical autonomy. \r\nSolomon Islanders have a native empathy for all people \r\nwho are struggling to reclaim what is rightfully due to \r\nthem under international law. Our support for their \r\nstruggle stems from our convictions about what is right \r\nand just. Our sovereign conscience is not a tradable \r\ncommodity. Our rejection of regular approaches for the \r\nreconsideration of our existing allegiances to Taiwan is \r\npremised on our preference, ideally, to recognize both \r\nChina and Taiwan on a realistic rather than an \r\nimaginary politico-juridical footing. \r\n This Assembly is the forum in which mutual \r\nrespect and goodwill prevail and enable us to implore \r\nChina, as one of the oldest civilizations of our world, \r\nto pledge its non-resort to force in settling the disputed \r\nquestion of its sovereignty over Taiwan. \r\n As one of Taiwan’s long-standing diplomatic \r\nallies, and undeterred by the result recently engineered \r\nby international political pragmatism, Solomon Islands \r\ncannot shirk its Charter obligations under Article 35, \r\nparagraph 1, to bring to the attention of this Assembly \r\nthe situation currently prevailing between Taiwan and \r\nChina. The situation is clearly of a nature requiring \r\ninvestigation by the Security Council, pursuant to \r\nArticle 34, on the basis that it “might lead to \r\ninternational friction or give rise to a dispute”. The \r\nSecurity Council is obliged to investigate the situation \r\nin order to determine whether the continuance thereof \r\nis likely to endanger the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.  \r\n Having now brought the situation to the attention \r\nof this Assembly, Solomon Islands expects that we will \r\nfollow the stipulations of Article 11, paragraph 2, in \r\ndiscussing any questions relating to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and making the \r\nnecessary recommendations or taking the requisite \r\naction that this Assembly is empowered to make and \r\ntake under the applicable provisions of the Charter. A \r\nfull, frank and fair discussion of the situation is the \r\nleast the Assembly can undertake to affirm our faithful \r\nobedience to our Charter’s creed and satisfy ourselves \r\nas to the existence of grounds for our further proactive \r\ninvolvement. \r\n Led by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, my \r\nGovernment belongs to a constituency of States for \r\nwhom the United Nations represents the promise of \r\nhope for civilizations condemned by circumstance to \r\neternal misery. The effective representation of our \r\nhope, voice and vision in this Organization can be \r\nachieved only by the reform of its governance \r\nstructures to reflect the changing configurations of \r\ngeopolitical power and influence. Solomon Islands \r\ntherefore supports the proposal for the enlargement of \r\nthe Security Council. We also believe that India and \r\nJapan must be allocated permanent seats on the \r\nCouncil. \r\n The attainment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals will remain elusive for many nations unless \r\ninnovative strategies for debt conversion and \r\ncancellation are devised and adopted to fast-track the \r\npoor’s exit from poverty. We look forward to exploring \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n27 07-52299 \r\n \r\nthat prospect at the forthcoming meeting on financing \r\nfor development in Doha. \r\n Solomon Islands has reason to register its \r\ndisappointment with the Division for Ocean Affairs and \r\nthe Law of the Sea for its tardy action in releasing \r\nfunds that are payable to us from the Trust Fund for \r\nSpecial Aspects of the Implementation of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea to defray \r\nthe costs and expenses of establishing our sovereign \r\nclaims to continental shelf areas registrable under \r\narticle 76 of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea. We are concerned that any further \r\ndelay in accessing those funds might affect our \r\nregistration entitlements due to non-compliance with \r\ntime restrictions. \r\n Time deprives me of the opportunity to chronicle \r\nmany more grievances that we needlessly experience in \r\nsecuring the benefits accorded us by virtue of our \r\nmembership in this Organization. The appointment of \r\nthe Deputy Resident Representative of the United \r\nNations Development Programme, stationed in the \r\nSolomon Islands, is a welcome sign of the United \r\nNations interest in my country’s problems and permits \r\nus to interact more closely with the Organization in \r\nprioritizing the remedial action we need to undertake \r\nfor the betterment of the lives of our population. With a \r\nvisible presence in our midst and on our shores, the \r\nUnited Nations will no longer be remote from the \r\nconsciousness of the people it exists to serve. \r\n Before I conclude, allow me to take this \r\nopportunity to extend to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon my Prime Minister’s invitation to visit our \r\nshores during his tenure in office. We sincerely hope \r\nHis Excellency will honour the Government and people \r\nof Solomon Islands by becoming the first Secretary-\r\nGeneral to venture to my country. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham, \r\nSecretary of the General People’s Committee for \r\nForeign Liaison and International Cooperation of the \r\nSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. \r\n Mr. Shalgham (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I would like to congratulate \r\nthe President on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am \r\nconfident that, thanks to his experience and wisdom, he \r\nwill lead the work of this forum to the best results. I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to express our \r\nsatisfaction with the manner in which Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa conducted the deliberations of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session and the \r\nefforts she made for United Nations reform and, with \r\nregard to several controversial issues, to arrive at \r\nsolutions acceptable to all. I also wish to express our \r\ngratitude for the efforts exerted by His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, since his appointment as Secretary-\r\nGeneral, to implement the resolutions of the United \r\nNations and to achieve the purposes of the Charter. \r\n The reform of the United Nations has been the \r\ncentral issue in our deliberations in the General \r\nAssembly and in a number of other forums over the \r\npast two years. We were able to move forward towards \r\nachieving our goals on some aspects of the reform \r\nprocess. However, there is still a long way to go, \r\nespecially in the absence of real progress towards \r\nreforming the Security Council and enhancing the role \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n That issue has been the subject of intensive \r\nconsultations in which many ideas were put forward, \r\nsome of which were realistic and based on the \r\nprinciples of equal sovereignty for all nations and \r\nequitable geographical representation. Other ideas, \r\nhowever, involved consolidating the control of the \r\npowerful States over the United Nations bodies and the \r\nconcept that those with privileges in the Security \r\nCouncil should maintain those privileges and reject any \r\nactive role for other actors in that respect. That latter \r\nattitude cannot lead to any true reform contributing to \r\nthe realization of the purposes embodied in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n A realistic assessment of progress made in the \r\nprocess of United Nations reform, especially in light of \r\nthe impasse in negotiations regarding Security Council \r\nreform, leads us to the conviction that there is an \r\nurgent need for a new world summit conference that \r\nwould push forward the reform process and bring to a \r\nconclusion the work that we began two years ago. \r\n In order to achieve this, Libya calls, from this \r\npodium, for a high-level summit meeting to be held at \r\nthe United Nations in Geneva within the framework of \r\nthe sixty-third session of the General Assembly, in \r\n2008. Such a meeting would be devoted to the reform \r\nprocess of the United Nations and the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council. Holding such an important meeting \r\nin Geneva, a city that lies at the centre of the world, \r\nwould provide the opportunity for all world leaders to \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 28 \r\n \r\nattend, to present constructive proposals and to \r\nparticipate in decision-making regarding this thorny \r\nissue that concerns the entire world. \r\n True reform of the United Nations means putting \r\ndecision-making powers in the hands of all of its \r\nMembers, that is to say, in the hands of the General \r\nAssembly, where all countries have equal vote. The \r\nSecurity Council would thus become an instrument for \r\nimplementing General Assembly resolutions and we \r\nwould overcome the obstacles caused by the veto, \r\nwhich puts international decision-making power in the \r\nhands of the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil and greatly encourages selectivity and double \r\nstandards in dealing with international problems. \r\n In our efforts to reform the Security Council, we \r\nmust consider a new formula for permanent \r\nmembership in which membership would be awarded \r\nto geographical groups and not to specific countries. In \r\nthis regard, we demand that the African Union — since \r\nAfrica is the only continent which has no \r\nrepresentative among the permanent members — be \r\ngranted permanent membership in the Security Council \r\nwith all the privileges enjoyed by other permanent \r\nmembers. \r\n While we encourage the current negotiations \r\nregarding reform of the Security Council, we stress the \r\nfact that Libya adheres to the Common African \r\nPosition, issued at the fifth African Union Summit, \r\nheld in Sirte on 4 and 5 July 2005. This position was \r\nconfirmed at subsequent African Union summit \r\nconferences. It calls for the African continent to be \r\ngranted five non-permanent seats and two permanent \r\nseats with all the privileges that other permanent \r\nmembers enjoy, including the right of veto. \r\n Libya seeks the support of all Member States for \r\na seat on the Security Council so that it may continue \r\nto carry out its efforts to achieve the objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations, building on its experience of non-\r\npermanent membership in 1976 and 1977. Libya has \r\ntherefore submitted its candidature for non-permanent \r\nmembership for the coming period 2008-2009. This \r\ncandidature enjoys the support of the African Union as \r\nexpressed in its resolution EX.CL/DEC. 308 (IX) \r\nissued in Banjul on 29 June 2007, of the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference in its resolution ORG 33/2 \r\nissued in Baku on 21 June 2006 and of the Arab \r\nLeague in its resolution on 6 September 2006. \r\n Libya’s firm commitment to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, its notable \r\ncontribution to international peace and security and its \r\nsupport for development, especially in Africa, \r\ndemonstrate that Libya is highly qualified for \r\nmembership in the Security Council. \r\n As a member of the Council, Libya would strive \r\nto emphasize the central role played by the United \r\nNations in achieving international peace and security; \r\nto strengthen respect for international law and the \r\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter; to enhance \r\npluralism in international relations through the United \r\nNations; to strengthen cooperation between the United \r\nNations and regional organizations in solving \r\ninternational problems; to contribute to United Nations \r\nreform; to work to increase cooperation and \r\ncoordination between the Security Council and the \r\nother organs of the United Nations, particularly the \r\nGeneral Assembly; to encourage swift and effective \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination in disaster \r\nmanagement and in the protection of human rights; to \r\ncontribute to the creation of permanent solutions to \r\ninternational problems based on justice, equity, and \r\nrespect for the principles of international law and to \r\nencourage further cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the African Union in the areas of conflict \r\nresolution, consolidation of peace and support for \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\n Libya strongly believes in the objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations and consistently meets its obligations \r\nto the Organization. Among Member States, Libya was \r\nthe second-largest African contributor to the United \r\nNations budget and to the budget of peacekeeping \r\noperations in the biennium 2004-2006. Furthermore, \r\nLibya provides a large share of voluntary contributions \r\nto serve the goals of the United Nations. \r\n Moreover, Libya is one of the countries that have \r\nmost often resorted to the mechanisms of the United \r\nNations to resolve international disagreements. For \r\nexample, it resorted to the International Court of \r\nJustice to resolve its border problems with Chad, \r\nTunisia and Malta and has accepted and implemented \r\nthe rulings of the Court. \r\n Libya has been a key mediator in the resolution \r\nof a number of conflicts and disputes, especially in \r\nAfrica, and has dispatched peacekeeping forces to the \r\nCentral African Republic, monitored the border \r\nbetween Chad and the Sudan and taken part in the \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n29 07-52299 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations mission in Darfur. Libya has also \r\nbegun to nominate personnel from the Libyan police \r\nforce to serve in United Nations missions in a number \r\nof African places. \r\n Libya has established partnerships with a number \r\nof countries, in the field of development, particularly \r\nin Africa. Additionally, in cooperation with the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, \r\nLibya is implementing numerous projects that provide \r\nfood in a number of African and Arab States. \r\n In cooperation with Cuba and Nigeria, Libya \r\nestablished the South-South Programme for health care \r\nin Africa and, in 2006, launched the Gaddafi \r\nProgramme for African women, children and young \r\npeople, which provides health care and educational \r\nservices in Africa. \r\n Libya has provided humanitarian aid to numerous \r\ncountries in order to alleviate the effects of disasters. \r\nRecipient countries have included Niger, Chad, the \r\nSudan, Somalia, Palestine, Indonesia, Pakistan and \r\nMauritania. Libya has also provided substantial aid to \r\nseveral African countries to combat desert locusts. \r\n In the field of disarmament, Libya believes that \r\ncomprehensive and complete disarmament, beginning \r\nwith the elimination of weapons of mass destruction \r\n(WMDs), is an essential prerequisite for the \r\nconsolidation of international peace and security. For \r\nthis reason, Libya initiated its voluntary abandonment \r\nof all programmes related to WMDs and their means of \r\ndelivery. Libya hopes that all nations that possess such \r\nweapons or related programmes will follow its \r\nexemplary behaviour. \r\n International cooperation, under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations, has achieved good results in the \r\nfight against terrorism. However, concentrating on the \r\nfight against this phenomenon, while ignoring its root \r\ncauses, will not bring terrorism to an end. Libya was \r\namong the first countries that called for coordination of \r\ninternational efforts to fight global terrorism. Since \r\n1992, Libya has called for a special session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to study this phenomenon and to \r\ntake the necessary measures to combat it by eradicating \r\nits root causes. \r\n We believe that the time has come to heed this \r\ncall and establish a precise definition of terrorism that \r\nwould protect human rights and halt the practice of \r\nconfusing terrorism with the legitimate right of people \r\nto fight against foreign occupation and to exercise self-\r\ndetermination and attain independence. \r\n Ending terrorism will require practical measures \r\nto eliminate its root causes, including effective action \r\nto promote human rights for all peoples, putting a stop \r\nto acts of aggression and the occupation of the land of \r\nothers, fighting poverty and encouraging democracy. \r\n Foreign occupation is the worst form of \r\nterrorism, because occupation forces subject entire \r\npeoples to measures which violate the most basic \r\nprinciples of human rights and commit daily crimes \r\nagainst those peoples in order to maintain their \r\noccupation. In our campaign to fight terrorism, it is \r\nimperative that we coordinate our efforts to finally put \r\nan end to foreign occupation, enable peoples to \r\nexercise their right to self-determination and prevent \r\ninterference in internal affairs.  \r\n We urgently need to implement the pledges that \r\nwe adopted in the Millennium Declaration, the Doha \r\nDeclaration and the outcomes of the Monterrey and \r\nJohannesburg conferences so that we can make ideal \r\nuse of our planet’s resources, end conflict, poverty, \r\nilliteracy and disease, provide all people with safe \r\ndrinking water, safeguard the environment and achieve \r\nsustainable development.  \r\n It falls upon the shoulders of the United Nations, \r\nin particular the Economic and Social Council, to \r\nestablish international partnerships for development \r\nwhich can achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nSuch partnerships should facilitate dialogue between \r\nNorth and South on the basis of respect for \r\nsovereignty, equality and sharing of benefits, and \r\nshould ensure that we reach the agreed goal of \r\ndevoting 0.7 per cent of the developed countries’ gross \r\nnational income to official development assistance \r\n(ODA) to developing countries. Such partnerships must \r\nlikewise ensure the appropriate application of all \r\nmultilateral free trade principles and must strengthen \r\nWorld Trade Organization measures regarding \r\npreferential treatment for developing countries, \r\nincluding making it easier for developing countries to \r\njoin that organization.  \r\n Countries with a colonial past bear the largest \r\nshare of responsibility to provide aid to developing \r\ncountries and to compensate them for the damage they \r\nsuffered during the colonial era. Similarly, countries \r\nthat waged war on the territories of other countries \r\nhave a responsibility to remove the mines, unexploded \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 30 \r\n \r\nordnance and explosive remnants of war they left in \r\nthose countries. They must provide the necessary maps, \r\nequipment and technical know-how to reclaim and \r\nrehabilitate damaged land in those developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n I call upon all Member States to aid the African \r\nUnion in its efforts to ensure that all African countries \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n The Palestinian people have lived in great misery \r\nfor more than half a century, since their land was \r\nseized. More than half of them were displaced to \r\nvarious parts of the world and those who remain have \r\nbeen subjected to a bloody and vicious Israeli \r\noccupation and to systematic violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law: houses are demolished, lands are \r\nconfiscated and Palestinian agricultural land is \r\nbulldozed. Under siege and denied food and medicine, \r\ninhabitants are expelled and unarmed citizens killed \r\nwhile the building of an apartheid wall continues. The \r\noppression to which the Palestinian people are \r\nsubjected and the failure of the United Nations to \r\nprotect them and to aid them in attaining their rights —\r\nthe right of return, the right to self-determination and \r\nthe right to establish an independent State on all \r\nPalestinian land — are factors that prevent the \r\nrestoration of peace and security in the region. It is \r\ntime to address the issue of Palestine more seriously \r\nand to refrain from attempts to impose a fait accompli \r\non the Palestinian people, depriving them of their \r\nlegitimate rights.  \r\n The tragedy that has befallen brotherly Iraq and \r\nthat has resulted in hundreds of thousands of Iraqi \r\ndeaths, injuries and refugees, requires an urgent United \r\nNations initiative to stop the bleeding, resolve the \r\ncrisis, ensure the withdrawal of the occupation forces, \r\nrestore Iraq’s stability and sovereignty, maintain Iraq’s \r\nterritorial integrity and empower the Iraqis to control \r\ntheir own resources and freely decide their own \r\ndestiny, while enabling all citizens to participate in the \r\nadministration of their country without the \r\nmarginalization of any group by any other group, so \r\nthat peace, security and prosperity may prevail in that \r\ncountry.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Osman Mohammed Saleh, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Eritrea. \r\n Mr. Saleh (Eritrea): Allow me to extend my \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to \r\nthe high office of President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session. I would also like to recognize \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain for her \r\ndistinguished service as President of the Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session. \r\n Please allow me also to extend my appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his strong \r\ncommitment and unceasing efforts in addressing issues \r\nof peace and security in many parts of the world where \r\nmany conflicts and tensions remain unresolved. I wish \r\nto assure him of my Government’s constructive support \r\nand its wholehearted commitment to peace and security \r\nin our region.  \r\n This session of the General Assembly provides \r\nMember States with the opportunity to address the \r\nchallenges and threats that continue to preoccupy us, \r\nincluding the lack of peace and security and the \r\npresence of extreme poverty, underdevelopment, \r\nenvironmental degradation and natural disasters.  \r\n In the interest of brevity, let me now revert to \r\nmore pressing problems closer to home. For the past \r\nfive years, it has, sadly, become almost a ritual for my \r\nGovernment to urge, from this rostrum, the \r\ninternational community, and especially the Security \r\nCouncil, to shoulder their fundamental responsibilities \r\nfor the maintenance of peace and security in our part of \r\nthe world. The legal principles at stake and the \r\nlooming threat to regional peace and stability have \r\nbeen and remain stark indeed. The hard facts are \r\nneither controversial nor ambiguous.  \r\n In flagrant breach of international law, the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the Algiers Peace \r\nAgreement, Ethiopia continues to occupy sovereign \r\nEritrean territories through military force. Ethiopia \r\ncontinues to reject the final and binding decision of the \r\nEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) and to \r\nobstruct the demarcation of the boundary, to which end \r\nthe international community has deployed the United \r\nNations Mission in Eritrea and Ethiopia (UNMEE) at \r\nan annual running cost about $200 million. Ethiopia \r\ncontinues to violate with impunity fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law, including full respect \r\nfor the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a fellow \r\nUnited Nations Member State, the integrity of \r\ninternational treaties and the norms of settling disputes \r\nthrough binding arbitration. Those are the indelible \r\nfacts on the ground that have been and are spawning a \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n31 07-52299 \r\n \r\nclimate of permanent and escalating tension in our part \r\nof the world. \r\n Throughout these years, the Boundary \r\nCommission has filed no less than 24 reports to the \r\nSecurity Council underlining the gravity of the \r\nsituation. The EEBC has no independent means or \r\npowers of enforcement. The legal authority and powers \r\nof enforcement reside, squarely and explicitly, with the \r\nSecurity Council, which is the guarantor of the Algiers \r\nPeace Agreement. As such, the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil should long have taken remedial action, both \r\nin accordance with Article 14 of the Algiers Peace \r\nAgreement as well as on the basis of Article 39 of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. But that has not happened to \r\ndate. Ethiopia has managed to frustrate the EEBC \r\ndecision and the demarcation of the boundary — which \r\nshould have been completed by 2003 — because of the \r\nunwarranted positions of some United Nations Security \r\nCouncil member States, and especially the United \r\nStates of America, which has regrettably chosen to \r\nplacate Ethiopia at the expense of international law and \r\nthe interests of regional peace and security. \r\n It was against the backdrop of Ethiopia’s defiance \r\nand violation of international law that the Boundary \r\nCommission convened a meeting of the parties in The \r\nHague early last month. Ethiopia first sought to prevent \r\nthe meeting from taking place by raising spurious legal \r\nobjections to the original venue — New York. And \r\nwhen that bogus pretext was removed and the meeting \r\nwas convened in The Hague, Ethiopia failed to respond \r\nto the five conditions that the Commission had \r\nimposed so that it could proceed and embark on the \r\ntime-bound schedule of operations that had been \r\nworked out in order to complete pillar emplacements \r\nalong the 1000 kilometre border in the coming months. \r\nThe five conditions that Ethiopia was requested to \r\nfulfil were: first, to indicate its unqualified acceptance \r\nof the 2002 Delimitation Decision without requiring \r\nbroader ranging negotiations between the parties; \r\nsecondly, to lift restrictions on the movement of EEBC \r\npersonnel; thirdly, to provide security assurances; \r\nfourthly, to meet payment arrears and fifthly, to allow \r\nfree access to pillar locations. \r\n At the Commission’s meeting, Eritrea committed \r\nitself once again to cooperate with the demarcation in \r\nall of the respects regarding which the Commission had \r\nexpressed concern. Eritrea’s commitments were made \r\nboth in writing and verbally, in front of the \r\nCommission and other participants. \r\n Eritrea asks merely that Ethiopia make the same \r\ncommitment to support the demarcation in accordance \r\nwith the Commission’s legitimate instructions. \r\nEthiopia, however, made it clear that it had no \r\nintention of complying with the Commission’s \r\ndemarcation instructions and raised tangential issues, \r\nwhich my delegation has fully addressed in the full text \r\nof my statement.  \r\n After the recent Boundary Commission meeting in \r\nearly September in The Hague — which I mentioned — \r\nthe text of a letter came to Eritrea’s attention. The letter \r\nhad been circulated to the public and the media without \r\ncommunicating it to the Eritrean Government through \r\nappropriate diplomatic or legal channel. In the letter \r\nthe Ethiopian Foreign Minister indicated Ethiopia’s \r\nintention to attempt to renounce the two Algiers \r\nAgreements in accordance with which the Eritrea-\r\nEthiopia border war of 1998-2000 was brought to an \r\nend.  \r\n The substance of Ethiopia’s letter and its timing \r\nunderscored the fact that the letter was intended simply \r\nas another effort to subvert the implementation of the \r\nfinal and binding award of the Eritrea-Ethiopia \r\nBoundary Commission. As such, that effort is clearly \r\nunlawful under the Vienna Convention on the Law of \r\nTreaties and other principles of international law, as \r\nwell as highly detrimental to regional peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n The Vienna Convention does not support \r\nEthiopia’s effort to deny legal force to the \r\nCommission’s award. Even if Ethiopia’s renunciation \r\nattempts were legally effective — which they are  \r\nnot — Article 70 of the Convention states that the \r\nboundary established under the Algiers Agreement \r\nremains binding on both parties. \r\n The Vienna Convention cannot simply be \r\ninterpreted to permit the dissatisfied party in a \r\nboundary arbitration to renounce the result \r\nretroactively. Indeed, Ethiopia seems to be planning to \r\nuse its unlawful attempt to renounce the Algiers \r\nAgreements in order to renew hostilities. The Algiers \r\nAgreements were designed to put an end once and for \r\nall to the two States’ conflicting claims to territory and \r\nthus to leave the two States free to rebuild their \r\nrelationship for the good of both of their peoples.  \r\n In the five and one half years since the Boundary \r\nCommission’s delimitation decision, however, Ethiopia \r\nhas repeatedly obstructed implementation of the \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 32 \r\n \r\ndecision and threatened to walk out on the process \r\naltogether, if it was not given everything that it wanted. \r\nWhile tens of thousands of Eritreans indigenous to the \r\nEthiopian-occupied regions wait in internally displaced \r\npersons camps for the chance to peacefully enjoy the \r\nbenefits of the final and binding award, Ethiopia is \r\nmoving new settlers onto their land, attempting to \r\nmake its illegal occupation of Eritrean territory \r\npermanent. That is in breach of the Algiers \r\nAgreements, in particular the Agreement on Cessation \r\nof Hostilities, and Chapter VII of the United Nations \r\nCharter should have been invoked to end Ethiopia’s \r\nflagrant violations with impunity of international law.  \r\n Eritrea sincerely hopes that the demarcation \r\nprocess can be restarted, in accordance with \r\ninternational law and consistent with the final and \r\nbinding delimitation award of 13 April 2002. This is \r\nthe central tenet of the Algiers Agreements and the key \r\nto reinstating regional harmony. It is important for \r\neffective action to be taken in the interest of legality \r\nand the maintenance of regional peace and security. \r\nThe United Nations and the Security Council have \r\nunequivocal legal and moral responsibilities to ensure \r\nthat this occurs without further delay and some Powers \r\nwith major interests in the region need to reassess their \r\npolicies so that the peoples in the region can live in \r\npeace and harmony. \r\n Ethiopia’s invasion of Somalia has become a \r\nserious concern in our region, and the Security Council \r\nand members of the international community must \r\ninsist on the unconditional and immediate withdrawal \r\nof all Ethiopian troops from Somalia in order to end \r\nthe occupation. \r\n I do not wish to conclude my statement without \r\nbriefly touching on the progress and the challenges that \r\nlie ahead in the peace process in the Sudan. The Sudan \r\nhas come a long way in addressing its internal \r\nconflicts, both by concluding peace agreements and by \r\nengaging in the implementation process of the terms \r\nand conditions of the peace accords. Eritrea will \r\ncontinue to lend its support to the peace process in \r\nDarfur by working closely with all concerned parties \r\nand countries, including the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union, in order to achieve a robust peace \r\npackage that will bring a lasting solution. In that \r\nregard, Eritrea looks forward to the Tripoli meeting \r\nlater this month. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nyan Win, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Union of Myanmar. \r\n Mr. Win (Myanmar): At the outset, I would like \r\nto congratulate the President on his assumption of the \r\nhigh office of President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. I would also like to convey \r\nMyanmar’s appreciation to his predecessor, Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, for her \r\nable stewardship of the previous session. The annual \r\nreport of the Secretary-General reflects the significant \r\nwork done in the past year by the United Nations in \r\nmeeting the challenges we face. We congratulate \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his successful first \r\nyear in office and welcome his timely initiative with \r\nregard to such pressing global issues as climate change. \r\nThe High-level Event on Climate Change has reignited \r\nthe international community’s interest in climate \r\nchange, and rightly so. Climate change remains the \r\nmost critical challenge that the international \r\ncommunity faces today. The adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, such as sea-level rise, hurricanes, floods, \r\ndrought and desertification, particularly in recent \r\nyears, are a stark reminder of the negative impact that \r\nclimate change has on the long-term economic and \r\nsocial development of the global community, \r\nparticularly the developing countries.  \r\n To address the adverse impacts of climate change, \r\nwe need concerted action at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. We need to be mindful that climate \r\nchange is not merely an environmental issue, but also a \r\nsustainable development issue. Accordingly, an \r\nintegrated and coordinated approach is required. For its \r\npart, Myanmar is pursuing a national environmental \r\npolicy based on the sustainable utilization of natural \r\nresources. In 1991, we adopted the Myanmar Agenda \r\n21, which serves as an important guideline for both the \r\npublic and private sectors. \r\n Myanmar also pursues a system of sustainable \r\nforest management. We have implemented a \r\nnationwide programme of afforestation and \r\nreforestation. As a result, we have been able to retain a \r\nforest cover of 50 per cent in the country. Myanmar \r\nwas among the 12 nations that took part in the Asia \r\nLeast-cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy in \r\ncooperation with the Asian Development Bank. The \r\ninventory of greenhouse gas emissions taken under the \r\nStrategy confirms that Myanmar is more of a sink than \r\na source of carbon dioxide emissions. The baseline \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n33 07-52299 \r\n \r\nprojection of the 2020 national greenhouse inventory \r\nalso shows that the forestry sector will continue to be a \r\nsignificant sink in Myanmar in the future. \r\n The economic activities undertaken by developed \r\ncountries, both historically and currently, are mainly \r\nresponsible for the emissions of greenhouse gases that \r\naffect the global climate system. The developing \r\ncountries, which are least responsible for contributing \r\nto climate change, face the greatest risk from its \r\nadverse impacts. Addressing the challenge of climate \r\nchange requires an integrated approach to economic \r\ngrowth, social development and environmental \r\nprotection. Concerted action must be taken within the \r\nframework of the internationally agreed United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and its \r\nKyoto Protocol, based on the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. It will require developed \r\ncountries to provide new and additional financial \r\nresources to developing countries and to fulfil the \r\ncommitments made at various international \r\nconferences. \r\n The impact of climate change is particularly felt \r\nin developing countries and has adversely affected \r\nnational development prospects. In order to effectively \r\nmeet the challenge of climate change, we would also \r\nhave to address poverty alleviation; then and only then \r\nwould the developing countries be able to achieve \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. It is, therefore, \r\nincumbent on the developed countries, whose \r\ndevelopment process rely heavily on the natural \r\nresource acquired from the developing countries, to \r\nprovide the necessary financial resource. \r\n Underdevelopment and mass deprivations lead to \r\neconomic, political and social hardships in developing \r\ncountries. Development provides an environment \r\nconducive to democracy. I would like to call upon the \r\nentire international community to work together for \r\npoverty alleviation. \r\n The scourge of terrorism knows no boundaries. \r\nCombating terrorism is the common endeavour of the \r\nentire international community. I would like to stress \r\nhere that terrorism in any form or manifestation must \r\nbe rejected. It is the innocent people who bear the \r\nbrunt of terrorist activities. To combat terrorism \r\neffectively, we also must address its root causes. \r\nPoverty, grievances and underlying political, economic \r\nand social conditions provide fertile ground for the \r\nspread of terrorism. These root causes of terrorism \r\nmust be addressed. \r\n Friendly relations among nations should be based \r\non respect for the principles of equal rights and self-\r\ndetermination. Countries should show goodwill, \r\npractice tolerance and live together in peace and \r\nharmony. Nations have various historical backgrounds, \r\ndiffering cultures, and different religions and customs. \r\nNations are not identical. However, respecting those \r\nbasic principles and practicing friendship and goodwill \r\nwill effectively contribute to our common endeavour to \r\ncombat terrorism. \r\n Today, the world is facing diverse problems and \r\ndaunting challenges. The United Nations, which \r\nrepresents the world community, is called upon to \r\nresolve them. Our Organization was formed in order to \r\nmaintain international peace and security, develop \r\nfriendly relations among nations and promote \r\ncooperation in solving international problems of an \r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character. In \r\norder to effectively address the full range of \r\nchallenges, the reform of the United Nations, as called \r\nfor by our leaders in the World Summit Outcome, must \r\nbe successfully implemented. \r\n I am confident, Mr. President, that under your \r\nable leadership we will make significant progress in \r\nthe United Nations reform process, taking into \r\nconsideration the position of the vast majority of the \r\nmembership. \r\n We are greatly disturbed to witness \r\nneocolonialism rearing its ugly head in recent years. \r\nThe strategies employed are obvious. As a first step, \r\nthe neocolonialists conduct media campaigns against \r\nthe targeted country and spread disinformation that the \r\ncountry concerned is committing gross human rights \r\nviolations. They portray these campaigns as a fight for \r\ndemocracy. Secondly, they impose sanctions, which \r\nhinder economic development and cause poverty \r\namong the people. Here I would like to stress that \r\neconomic sanctions are counterproductive and can only \r\ndelay the path to democracy. As a third step, they \r\nprovide political, financial and other material support \r\nin order to create unrest in the country. Finally, under \r\nthe pretext that a country is undemocratic and unstable \r\nand that it poses a threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity, they intervene directly and invade the country. \r\nCurrent events clearly show that such a course of \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 34 \r\n \r\naction can only result in conflict and untold suffering \r\nfor the people of the country. \r\n My country is currently subjected to such courses \r\nof action. The international community should also be \r\nwary of those neocolonialist attempts. Here it must be \r\nstressed that the destiny of each and every country can \r\nonly be determined by its Government and its own \r\npeople. It cannot be imposed from outside. On our part, \r\nwe are determined to proceed resolutely towards \r\ndemocracy along our chosen path. \r\n In the life of every nation, there are times when it \r\nmust face challenging situations and overcome them. \r\nMyanmar has gone through such a challenge recently. \r\nThe situation would not have deteriorated, if the initial \r\nprotest of a small group of activists against the rise in \r\nfuel prices had not been exploited by political \r\nopportunists. They sought to turn the situation into a \r\npolitical showdown, aided and abetted by certain \r\npowerful countries. They also took advantage of \r\nprotests staged initially by a small group of Buddhist \r\nclergy demanding an apology for the maltreatment of \r\nmonks by local authorities. The security personnel \r\nexercised the utmost restraint and did not intervene for \r\nnearly a month. However, when the mob became \r\nunruly and provocative, they were compelled to declare \r\na curfew. Subsequently, when protestors ignored their \r\nwarnings, they had to take action to restore the \r\nsituation. Normalcy has now returned to Myanmar. \r\n The rule of law is a fundamental principle \r\naccepted by nations. Without it there can be neither the \r\norderly conduct of the day-to-day affairs of State nor \r\nthe enjoyment of human rights and democracy by the \r\npeople. \r\n Myanmar is a multi-ethnic and multireligious \r\nsociety. It is home to over 100 national races who have \r\nlived together in weal or woe over the centuries. \r\nNational unity is of paramount importance to us. We \r\nhave, therefore, been striving to strengthen the fabric \r\nof our nation. In keeping with the aspirations of the \r\npeople for democratization, a seven-step road map was \r\ndeclared, and a national convention was held to lay \r\ndown the principles for a new constitution. Work was \r\nconcluded on 3 September 2007, adopting by \r\nconsensus the fundamental principles for the new \r\nconstitution. Based on these principles, a draft \r\nconstitution will be drawn up by legal experts. All the \r\nremaining steps will be implemented phase by phase. \r\n This process is applauded by the people. To date, \r\npeople in 11 townships have convened rallies in \r\nsupport of the successful conclusion of the national \r\nconvention. Townships all over the country are \r\nexpected to hold similar rallies. \r\n Recent events make clear that there are elements \r\nwithin and outside the country that wish to de-rail the \r\nongoing process so that they can take advantage of the \r\nchaos that would follow. They have become more and \r\nmore emboldened and have stepped up their campaign \r\nto confront the Government. \r\n The Myanmar Government is fully aware of its \r\nresponsibility to lead the nation in the process of \r\ntransformation to a disciplined democracy. We have \r\nlaid out a road map and will work conscientiously to \r\nachieve our goals. Significant progress has already \r\nbeen made. The process can be successfully completed, \r\nsooner rather than later, if no obstacles are placed in \r\nour path. In this regard, the international community \r\ncan best help Myanmar by showing greater \r\nunderstanding. They can begin by refraining from \r\nmeasures which would result in adding fuel to the fire. \r\n One area where the international community can \r\ndemonstrate good faith and objectivity is to \r\nacknowledge the good work done in Myanmar in \r\ncombating the scourge of narcotic drugs. As a result of \r\nour efforts to rid our country of those drugs by the year \r\n2014, the production of opium has plummeted to \r\nunprecedented levels. In the World Drug Report 2006, \r\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported \r\nthat in 2005 the total area under opium poppy \r\ncultivation showed a decrease of 26 per cent when \r\ncompared to that of 2004. The World Drug Report 2007 \r\nconfirms that in 2006 the total area under opium poppy \r\ncultivation was approximately 21,500 hectares, \r\nrepresenting a decrease of 34 per cent compared to \r\n2005. Here, I would like to stress that in terms of \r\nopium production, the decline is 88 per cent over a \r\nspan of eight years, declining from 2,560 tons to an \r\nestimated 292 tons. \r\n Myanmar regards the eradication of narcotic \r\ndrugs as a national priority. We have enhanced our \r\nenforcement capacity and have been providing \r\nalternative livelihoods to farmers to encourage them to \r\nend their dependence on opium poppy cultivation. We \r\nare also taking effective measures with regard to the \r\nemerging threat posed by methamphetamine-type \r\nstimulant drugs. Myanmar neither produces nor \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n35 07-52299 \r\n \r\nimports the precursor chemicals required for the \r\nproduction of those drugs. \r\n Cooperation with the United Nations is a \r\ncornerstone of Myanmar’s foreign policy. It is in this \r\nspirit that we continue to cooperate with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral with regard to his good offices role mandated \r\nby the General Assembly. We have agreed to the visit \r\nof his Special Adviser, Under-Secretary-General \r\nIbrahim Gambari, who is presently in my country. We \r\nwill continue to work closely and cooperate actively \r\nwith the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency The Honourable Sahana Pradhan, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Nepal. \r\n Mrs. Pradhan (Nepal): I congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession and pledge Nepal’s support in the successful \r\nexecution of his duties. I would also like to place on \r\nrecord our appreciation of the leadership of Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa during the \r\nsixty-first session. My delegation expresses its \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his stewardship of the United Nations and wishes him \r\na very successful tenure. \r\n The United Nations today remains the only truly \r\nglobal Organization to seek solutions to the world’s \r\nmost pressing issues. The increasing importance of \r\nmultilateralism has made the United Nations \r\nindispensable. The principles and purposes enshrined \r\nin the United Nations Charter should continue to guide \r\nus to address all the issues that confront us. Nepal has \r\nadopted these purposes and principles as the basic \r\ntenets of its foreign policy. \r\n The General Assembly has before it an important \r\nagenda that seeks to deal with the world’s most \r\npressing issues and problems. I fully agree with the \r\npriorities that the President of the General Assembly \r\nhas outlined for this session. \r\n The pledge of a road map for development in the \r\nform of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nremains to be fully achieved. As we approach the half-\r\nway point, this Assembly should review the progress \r\nmade to devise ways and means for achieving the full \r\nand effective implementation of the commitments \r\nmade in the Millennium Declaration. The follow-up \r\nconference on Financing for Development to be held in \r\nDoha in 2008 should be used as an opportunity to \r\neffectively meet the financing gap and explore \r\ninnovative ways of financing for development. \r\n We commend the Secretary-General for \r\nconvening a high-level meeting on climate change. I \r\nhope that the momentum generated will pave the way \r\nfor an agreement on climate change with long-term and \r\ncomprehensive global commitments beyond 2012, \r\nstarting the process in Bali later this year. \r\n Climate change is linked to human security, \r\nsocial and economic development and environmental \r\nprotection. Scientific studies point out that a solution to \r\nclimate change is within human reach and that we can \r\nachieve it without compromising economic \r\ndevelopment and human progress, if we start to act \r\nnow. \r\n Climate change demands a coordinated and \r\ncomprehensive global response. As enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities should be the basis for addressing the \r\nchallenges of climate change. Mandatory targets for \r\nemissions reduction are necessary in order to stabilize \r\nthe greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at \r\nsafe levels. Industrialized countries should assume \r\nleadership and demonstrate the necessary political will \r\nin adopting long-term commitments to reduce \r\nemissions. \r\n While sea levels are rising, the Himalayan \r\nglaciers are retreating, and surrounding areas are \r\nwitnessing an increasing intensity of disasters induced \r\nby climate-change, such as glacial lake outbursts, \r\nextreme rainfalls, recurring floods and massive \r\nlandslides. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n It is ironic that the world’s most vulnerable \r\ncountries, such as least developed and small island \r\ncountries, get the worst affects of climate change \r\nalthough they are the least responsible for the same. In \r\nthe new compact in climate change, there should be \r\nspecial provisions for addressing the mitigation and \r\nadaptation needs of the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) and small island nations to address their \r\nspecial vulnerabilities. \r\n Nepal stands firm against any form of terrorism. \r\nWe have been implementing the provisions of various \r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions to combat \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 36 \r\n \r\ninternational terrorism. Effective implementation of the \r\nprovisions of the United Nations global counter-\r\nterrorism study adopted last year can foster \r\ninternational cooperation against terrorism. We call for \r\nan early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism. There should be a coordinated \r\nglobal response, including through the mechanism at \r\nthe United Nations, to address the underlying social, \r\neconomic and political causes of the existence and \r\nspread of global terrorism. \r\n Reform of the United Nations has constantly \r\nengaged us. We need to reflect contemporary realities \r\nfor making the Organization more effective, \r\nrepresentative, responsive and capable of handling the \r\nincreasingly complex global problems. The General \r\nAssembly needs to be further strengthened as a true \r\ndecision-making body. We should develop an effective \r\nmechanism to implement its decisions. \r\n The reform of the United Nations should include \r\nreform of its Security Council. We support extending \r\nmembership in both permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories to reflect the realities of the day. We feel \r\nthat India, Brazil, Germany and Japan deserve \r\npermanent places in the expanded Council, while \r\nAfrica should also be fairly represented. We also \r\nfavour a tangible improvement in the working methods \r\nof the Council, and we welcome the agreement that the \r\nGeneral Assembly should start the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on this important issue as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n Nepal welcomes the restructuring of the \r\npeacekeeping-related departments of the United \r\nNations Secretariat, including the creation of a new \r\nDepartment of Field Support. In view of the increasing \r\ncomplexity and size of the peacekeeping operations, \r\nwe hope these changes will further enhance \r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations and ensure \r\nthe safety and security of peacekeeping personnel. \r\n Nepal has continuously participated in the in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations for last five \r\ndecades. To this date, Nepal has sent more than 60,000 \r\ntroops to over 30 United Nations missions. At present, \r\nNepal is the fourth largest contributor of troops and \r\npolice personnel to United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions. Nepalese Blue Helmets have been \r\ncommended for performing extremely well in all \r\ncircumstances. Many have sacrificed their invaluable \r\nlives to the cause of peace worldwide. \r\n Peacekeeping is the soul of the United Nations, \r\nits largest function and the most successful invention in \r\nthe realm of international relations. This enterprise can \r\nsucceed only with meaningful participation of troop-\r\ncontributing countries in decision-making processes \r\nand their increasing role in senior positions. \r\n Nepal stands for general and complete \r\ndisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, \r\nincluding biological, chemical and nuclear weapons \r\nunder effective international control in a time-bound \r\nmanner. \r\n We are concerned by the lack of progress in \r\nmajor multilateral negotiations in disarmament, \r\nincluding in nuclear disarmament, and in control of \r\nillegal proliferation of small arms and light weapons. \r\nWe call upon Member States, especially the nuclear \r\nweapon States, to step up measures for disarmament to \r\nrelease much-needed dividends for development. We \r\nhope that the newly established office of High \r\nRepresentative for Disarmament Affairs will infuse \r\ndynamism into the process. \r\n We look forward to the inauguration of the \r\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and \r\nDisarmament for Asia and the Pacific soon in \r\nKathmandu, in accordance with resolution 61/94, \r\nadopted by the Assembly last year for relocation of this \r\ncentre. The Government of Nepal and the United \r\nNations Secretariat have already signed the host \r\ncountry agreement and the memorandum of \r\nunderstanding to this effect. Through this Centre, \r\nNepal is committed to revitalizing the process of \r\nregional disarmament, including the Kathmandu \r\nprocess. \r\n The ideals of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) \r\nremain as valid today as they were when the Movement \r\nwas founded. The principled position of the NAM \r\ncountries should guide the Assembly’s deliberations. I \r\nwish to reiterate Nepal’s commitment to the principles \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, including the \r\nprinciples of non-interference in internal affairs and the \r\npeaceful coexistence of States. \r\n The Group of 77 and China has become highly \r\nrelevant in advancing the interests of the developing \r\ncountries in the United Nations. The Assembly should \r\ncontinue to protect the interests of the developing \r\ncountries. We also need to advance meaningful South-\r\nSouth cooperation to complement global partnership \r\nand North-South cooperation. \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n37 07-52299 \r\n \r\n We call for concerted efforts to address the \r\nspecial needs and difficulties of the LDCs and the \r\nlandlocked developing countries, including the \r\nnegative impacts and marginalization of globalization. \r\nWe urge the developed countries to meet the targeted \r\nofficial development assistance to the LDCs, give \r\nproducts of the LDCs duty-free, quota-free and \r\nunhindered market access and extend debt relief \r\nmeasures to cover all LDCs. We should ensure \r\neffective implementation of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction for LDCs for the rest of decade, based on the \r\nmid-term review held last year. \r\n I would like to draw the attention of the \r\ndevelopment partners to addressing the special needs \r\nof the LDCs emerging from conflict and the need to \r\nsupport them financially and technically, to help them \r\nachieve sustained peace and development and prevent a \r\nrelapse into the conflict situation. \r\n The landlocked developing countries face special \r\ndifficulties in the transit and transport of goods and \r\nservices to and from the sea. The Almaty Programme \r\nshould be sincerely implemented for meaningful \r\ncooperation in transit, transport and trade facilitation in \r\nthe landlocked developing countries. The mid-term \r\nreview process of the Programme, to be held in 2008, \r\nshould focus on fulfilling gaps in implementation of \r\nthe agreed commitments. \r\n We must not further delay the World Trade \r\nOrganization trade negotiations for advancing the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda. Those negotiations should find \r\nways to further protect the interests of the least \r\ndeveloped and landlocked countries to make them able \r\nto compete in global markets. In particular, the \r\ninternational community must meet the resources gap, \r\noperationalize aid for trade initiatives, strengthen \r\ntrading capacities and support trade adjustment costs in \r\nthe LDCs and the landlocked developing countries.  \r\n Nepal welcomes the proposal for United Nations \r\nsystem-wide coherence on development, environment \r\nand humanitarian issues. This process should \r\nstrengthen the national and regional focus and country \r\nownership of development programmes. \r\n We support effective gender architecture in the \r\nUnited Nations and an even stronger regional and \r\ncountry presence of the United Nations on gender \r\nissues. Nepal accords high priority to promotion of \r\nwomen’s right, gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women. A parliamentary declaration adopted on  \r\n30 May 2006 has provided for equal property and \r\ncitizenship rights to women and for their representation \r\nin at least one third of the elected bodies, including in \r\nthe Parliament. \r\n Nepal is committed to the protection and \r\npromotion of the rights of children, including those \r\naffected by conflict. The peace agreement provides for \r\nimmediate release of children if found recruited as \r\ncombatants and their rehabilitation and integration \r\nback into their families. The Government is committed \r\nto implementing recommendations of the Security \r\nCouncil Working Group on Children and Armed \r\nConflict in Nepal. \r\n The United Nations has been rather slow to \r\nrespond to the world’s major conflicts and \r\nhumanitarian crises, in places ranging from the Middle \r\nEast to Darfur and Somalia. Although the agreement on \r\nthe African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur is a step forward, there were missed \r\nopportunities in addressing the long-standing \r\nhumanitarian crisis in that region. \r\n The situations in Afghanistan and Iraq demand \r\nmore proactive United Nations engagement. The \r\nOrganization should continue to play a constructive \r\nrole in helping those countries to achieve stabilization, \r\nnational unity and reconciliation. \r\n We support the democratic aspirations of people \r\nall over the world. We hope that a solution to \r\nMyanmar’s internal situation will be found by the \r\npeople of that country through dialogue and the \r\ndemocratic process. \r\n Since 1990, Nepal has been sheltering more than \r\n100,000 refugees from Bhutan on humanitarian \r\ngrounds. There is a stalemate in this long-standing \r\ncrisis, mainly because of Bhutan’s reluctance to \r\nimplement the agreements already reached or to engage \r\nin negotiations with a view to finding some other \r\nacceptable solution. That procrastination has caused \r\nrefugees to run out of patience. The true solution to \r\nthis problem lies in giving refugees the opportunity to \r\nbe able to return to Bhutan and to participate in the \r\ncountry’s political process in a fully democratic way, \r\ntaking into account the people’s cultural diversity and \r\nhuman rights. However, we are positively considering \r\nthe offers made by some countries to give refugees the \r\nvoluntary option of third-country resettlement, should \r\nthey so choose it, as part of a provisional solution. That \r\nshould not absolve Bhutan of its responsibility towards \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 38 \r\n \r\nits exiled citizens, which is a problem between the \r\nrefugees and the Bhutanese regime. Nepal appreciates \r\nthe continued humanitarian assistance extended by the \r\ninternational community, the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and other \r\nagencies for the care of refugees. \r\n Nepal is in the process of leaving behind its \r\ndecade-long internal conflict though a unique and \r\ninternally driven peace process. We are committed to \r\nbringing that process to a successful conclusion. The \r\nGovernment is engaged in dialogue with the \r\nCommunist Party of Nepal (Maoist) to ensure that the \r\nelections to the Constituent Assembly are held on \r\n22 November, thus sincerely honouring and \r\nimplementing the commitments set out in the peace \r\nagreements.  \r\n It was through dialogue that the Government of \r\nNepal recently concluded agreements with the leaders \r\nof the Madhesi Janajati movement, enabling them to a \r\nhave stronger voice in the political arena and broader \r\nrepresentation in the Constituent Assembly. \r\n Despite the challenges associated with the peace \r\nprocess, the Government is determined to hold the \r\nelections to the Constituent Assembly on time. With \r\nthe necessary technical, legal and logistical \r\ncompetence, the Election Commission has made \r\npreparations for holding the elections as scheduled and \r\nin a free and fair manner. I would like to invite friendly \r\ncountries and organizations to send observers to Nepal \r\nduring the elections. \r\n The people of Nepal have expressed their desire \r\nfor a peaceful political and socio-economic \r\ntransformation. They have spoken out in favour of an \r\ninclusive, democratic and participatory restructuring of \r\nthe State. I have every confidence that the peace \r\nprocess will reap numerous dividends for the Nepalese \r\npeople through the creation of a new Nepal. In that \r\nprocess, we expect generous assistance from our \r\ndevelopment partners, including assistance in meeting \r\nNepal’s reconstruction and development needs. \r\n On behalf of the people and the Government of \r\nNepal, I wish to express sincere gratitude to the \r\ninternational community for its strong support and \r\nsolidarity during our struggle for democracy and our \r\nongoing peace process. \r\n Last year, we invited the United Nations to \r\nfacilitate the peace process through arms monitoring \r\nand through technical support for the Constituent \r\nAssembly elections. We express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his personal attention and \r\ninterest in assisting the peace process. We also \r\ncommend the role played by the United Nations \r\nMission in Nepal in that process. \r\n The Government is steadfast in protecting and \r\npromoting human rights, in keeping with its \r\ninternational commitments. We welcome the adoption \r\nby the Human Rights Council of the universal periodic \r\nreview of all Member States. That exercise should be \r\nfree from politicization, selectivity and double \r\nstandards. \r\n There has been a remarkable improvement in the \r\nprotection of human rights in Nepal since the start of \r\nthe peace process. The Government has extended full \r\ncooperation to the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights in Nepal. The recent appointment of \r\nmembers of the National Human Rights Commission of \r\nNepal is expected to further enhance our national \r\ncapability to protect and promote human rights. \r\n The Government is determined to bring an end to \r\nthe environment of impunity that was present during \r\nthe armed conflict. We hope that the establishment of a \r\ntruth and reconciliation commission, as stipulated in \r\nthe peace agreement, will also help us to put our past \r\nbehind us and to prevent a recurrence of such grave \r\nhuman rights violations.  \r\n As a nation that has a diverse ethnic composition \r\nand that is home to various indigenous peoples, Nepal \r\nwelcomes the adoption of the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the \r\nGeneral Assembly this year. We hope that the \r\nDeclaration will serve as a useful reference for \r\nindigenous issues throughout the world. \r\n In conclusion, the General Assembly has before it \r\nan important opportunity to address the most pressing \r\nissues of our times — issues that are of lasting \r\nsignificance. We should strive to advance agreements \r\nto address climate change, follow up on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, seek new resources \r\nfor development financing, break the impasse in the \r\nnegotiations on trade and disarmament and reform the \r\nSecurity Council. We should also seek solutions to \r\nunresolved conflicts and humanitarian crises. \r\n Today, the world’s major problems demand the \r\nleadership of the United Nations. We should rise to the \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n39 07-52299 \r\n \r\noccasion and demonstrate our ability to work together \r\nto solve urgent problems that confront us. Solutions to \r\nmost global problems are within our reach if we act in \r\nunison, guided by our collective wisdom and reason. \r\nTogether, we can make progress in all these areas. I \r\npledge Nepal’s constructive participation in arriving at \r\nimportant decisions on all these issues here at the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The President: Before proceeding further, I \r\nwould like to remind members that, as announced in \r\ntoday’s Journal, the informal meeting of the plenary to \r\nobserve the first International Day of Non-Violence \r\nwill be held tomorrow, 2 October, from 9.30 to 10 a.m. \r\nin this Hall. All are invited to attend. \r\n I now call on His Excellency Mr. Mohamed \r\nBenaissa, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation \r\nof Morocco. \r\n Mr. Benaissa (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nshould like at the outset to express heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its present \r\nsession, as well as my best wishes for every success \r\nduring your tenure. I also wish to thank Her Excellency \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her constructive \r\nand tireless efforts during her remarkable and fruitful \r\npresidency at the previous session, which was a source \r\nof pride for her country, Bahrain, and for the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n As this is the first session of the General \r\nAssembly under our newly appointed Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, I should like to reaffirm, \r\non behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco, our full \r\nconfidence in and support for his tireless efforts and \r\ngood offices aimed at enabling the United Nations to \r\nattain its lofty objectives and to fulfil the aspirations of \r\nall nations. It is our hope that, at the dawn of the third \r\nmillennium, a more just and effective world system can \r\nemerge, enabling nations to achieve collective peace \r\nand sustainable development.  \r\n Our session takes place at the eve of the \r\ncelebration by the United Nations of the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of two important historical events that \r\nhave marked its activities, forged its identity and \r\nproved its added value and its outstanding contribution \r\nto strengthening international cooperation, protecting \r\nhuman dignity and consolidating world peace and \r\nsecurity. These events are the General Assembly’s \r\nadoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and the deployment of the first United \r\nNations peacekeeping operation in that same year. In \r\nthis context, it is appropriate to pause and take stock of \r\nwhat has been done in these two vital areas, and to \r\noutline the work objectives of our Organization in \r\norder to develop and optimize our common assets in a \r\ncomplex international melieu.  \r\n The Universal Declaration of Human Rights laid \r\nthe foundations of international consensus regarding \r\nuniversal values and subsequently contributed to \r\ninternational efforts for the codification, protection and \r\nrespect of basic cultural, social, economic and political \r\nrights. To this end, the international community is \r\ninvited, through the United Nations, to take concrete \r\nmeasures to implement the provisions of this \r\nDeclaration and give effect to confirm concretely its \r\npolitical and legal values.  \r\n In that connection, His Majesty King Mohammed \r\nVI stated in a royal address on 9 December 1999 that \r\namong the appropriate means of ensuring respect for \r\nhuman rights was the commitment to the relevant \r\ninternational covenants and the setting up of \r\nmechanisms for respecting and safeguarding these \r\nrights. He added that those legal and institutional \r\ninstruments were, however, insufficient if respect for \r\nhuman rights was not part of standard conduct at all \r\nlevels, or if, in other words, it did not become a shared \r\nculture. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco has embarked, under \r\nHis Majesty’s enlightened leadership, on a thorough \r\nand ambitious process of political openness, human \r\ndevelopment and social modernization. In parallel, it is \r\nwilling to participate in constructive international \r\nefforts aimed at establishing world consensus on \r\nhuman rights concepts, so that they no longer \r\nconstitute a source of conflict and confrontation but are \r\nrather a motive for cooperation and consultation. Those \r\nconcepts should not remain mere universal values but \r\nshould become a reality, taking into consideration the \r\ndiversity and indivisibility of human rights.  \r\n In this regard, the Kingdom of Morocco proposed \r\nlast March, in the Human Rights Council, the adoption \r\nof a universal declaration on training and education in \r\nthe culture of human rights, whose objective would be \r\nto consolidate and reinforce the values, principles and \r\nconcepts of human rights by all international social \r\ncomponents, so that they become a daily concern and a \r\nresponsible practice. Morocco hopes that this proposal \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 40 \r\n \r\nwill be supported by all States, so that it may constitute \r\na valuable contribution to the celebration of the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nrights.  \r\n Peacekeeping operations are a key element of the \r\nactivities of the United Nations, embodying the \r\ncollective security principle that is one of the pillars of \r\nthe United Nations Charter. Thanks to this mechanism, \r\nthe United Nations has displayed a great capacity to \r\nadapt to change and has been able to participate in a \r\ndirect and effective manner in the reinforcement of \r\ninternational peace.  \r\n The importance of peacekeeping operations has \r\nincreased with the evolution of the traditional concept \r\nand the accumulation of tasks, which are no longer \r\nlimited to peacekeeping per se. These tasks have also \r\nbroadened in scope to encompass assistance to States \r\nundergoing reconstruction or engaged in the \r\nimplementation of transitional justice, the \r\nconsolidation of human rights, or good governance. \r\n In this respect, the Kingdom of Morocco has been \r\na pioneer in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, \r\nsending since 1960 more than 50,000 Blue Helmets to \r\n13 peacekeeping operations across four continents. \r\nThanks to their sacrifice and determination to uphold \r\nthe principles of the United Nations, the Royal Armed \r\nForces, along with the other peacekeeping troops, \r\nhelped the United Nations to win the Nobel Peace \r\nprize.  \r\n In view of its cumulative experience and field \r\nexpertise, the Kingdom of Morocco believes that it is \r\nhigh time to examine ways and means of reinforcing \r\nthe legal basis and organizational framework of \r\npeacekeeping operations, while taking into \r\nconsideration the changes undergone by this United \r\nNations mechanism, as well as the need for \r\nimprovement of the deployment conditions and work \r\narrangements of its personnel.  \r\n Accordingly, the Kingdom of Morocco proposes \r\nthe organization next year of a high-level meeting to \r\nexamine this issue in all its aspects, with a view to \r\nadopting recommendations for the development of new \r\nnorms and work arrangements that will ensure the \r\nsuccess of peacekeeping operations.  \r\n Despite its efforts, Africa still faces major \r\nsecurity challenges and significant difficulties in \r\nimproving the health and living conditions of its \r\ncitizens. Given its deep-rooted African identity and its \r\nprofound historical, human and cultural ties with \r\nAfrican States, the Kingdom of Morocco has, as \r\ndirected by His Majesty the King, made its relations \r\nwith the continent one of the priorities of its foreign \r\npolicy. These relations are based on the principles of \r\nmutual respect, active solidarity, fruitful cooperation \r\nand constructive involvement in the regional initiatives \r\nand international strategies related to the continent. \r\n Besides participating in development \r\nprogrammes aimed at effectively revitalizing South-\r\nSouth cooperation and undertaking numerous solidarity \r\nactivities with African States victims of natural \r\ndisasters, the Kingdom of Morocco hosted the first \r\nAfrican Conference on Human Development, held in \r\nApril 2007 in Rabat in cooperation with the United \r\nNations Development Programme. The Conference \r\ncreated an opportunity to establish a complementary \r\nstrategy to meet the particular needs of Africa in the \r\ncontext of achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n In this regard, the Rabat Declaration on human \r\ndevelopment and the plan of action and \r\nrecommendations of the Conference, constitute a \r\nframework of reference for the holding next year of a \r\nhigh-level meeting on Africa and development, as \r\nproposed by Morocco. Likewise, the conclusions of the \r\nRabat Conference could contribute significantly to the \r\nwork of the World Millennium Development Goals \r\nsummit to be held next year in response to a proposal \r\nmade by the United Kingdom Prime Minister.  \r\n Morocco expresses the hope that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s next report on the causes of conflicts and the \r\npromotion of peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica will contain practical recommendations and a \r\nclear political vision aimed at the reinforcement of \r\nstability, peace and security on the African continent, \r\nthe consolidation of democracy and human rights, \r\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nAfrican States, and the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nin accordance with the principle of good \r\nneighbourliness. \r\n The Moroccan Sahara issue, one of the longest \r\nregional disputes in Africa, is at a historical turning \r\npoint as a result of the launching of the Manhassett \r\nnegotiations between the parties to the dispute, held \r\nunder United Nations auspices. This turning point \r\nresults from the dynamic created by the Moroccan \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n41 07-52299 \r\n \r\nautonomy plan for Moroccan Shara, a plan which has \r\nopened promising perspectives for overcoming the \r\nstalemate on this issue at the United Nations. It offers \r\nthe fundamental elements necessary for a realistic, \r\napplicable, definitive and final political solution to a \r\nregional dispute that has hindered the development of a \r\nstrong and homogeneous Maghreb that interacts with \r\nits geopolitical and geostrategic environment. \r\n The Moroccan autonomy plan, which since 2004 \r\nhas answered the calls by the Security Council for the \r\nneed to find a political solution to that dispute, is in \r\nconformity with the provisions of international law. It \r\nis the result of wide-ranging international consultations \r\nand in-depth deliberations involving inhabitants of the \r\nregion through the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan \r\nAffairs. \r\n In the light of that positive dynamic, the Security \r\nCouncil adopted resolution 1754 (2007), which \r\nrepresented a departure from former approaches in the \r\ntreatment of the issue, since it called for negotiations \r\nwhile taking into account recent developments, in \r\nparticular the Moroccan plan and the efforts of the \r\nKingdom which the Security Council has recognized as \r\nserious and credible. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco, which took part in \r\nthose negotiations in good faith and with an open and \r\nconstructive attitude, reiterates its commitment to \r\nadvance the process in order to reach a final solution to \r\nthe dispute within the framework of its national \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity as well as on the \r\nbasis of the autonomy plan, as the ultimate objective of \r\nthe negotiation process and as an open, flexible and \r\nindivisible offer. The solution to this regional dispute \r\nin the light of the Moroccan plan would lead to the \r\ncreation of a stable regional security order, based on \r\ncooperation between the States of the region, which \r\nwould deal with the serious security challenges of the \r\nregion, including terrorism, human trafficking and \r\nother clandestine activities. The impact of such \r\nactivities will go beyond the region and will affect \r\nEuropean, Mediterranean and West African countries \r\nas well. \r\n The difficult circumstances in the Middle East \r\nrequire strengthened coordinated efforts in order to put \r\nan end to a lengthy and bitter conflict that has caused \r\ngreat suffering for the people of the region for more \r\nthan half a century. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco, which follows closely \r\nall those developments, affirms once again from this \r\nrostrum the pressing need to reactivate the peace \r\nprocess in the Middle East according to a \r\ncomprehensive approach and on the basis of \r\nagreements signed by the parties, the Road Map and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative. That is a strategic choice and \r\nreflects the sincere will of the Arab States to search for \r\na just and lasting peace in the Middle East — a peace \r\nthat guarantees the national rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople, including the right to establish an independent \r\nState, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, and \r\nwithdrawal from occupied Arab territories in Syria and \r\nLebanon, in order to allow the States and peoples of \r\nthe region to live in peace and security. \r\n Morocco is optimistic about the positive results \r\nthat will ensure from the international conference on \r\nMiddle East peace to be held in the United States \r\nbefore the end of this year. Moreover, the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco, which chairs the Al-Quds Committee in the \r\nperson of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, insists \r\nonce more on the need to respect the special status of \r\nJerusalem and to preserve its cultural and spiritual \r\nidentity. In that respect, His Majesty King Mohammed \r\nVI has endeavoured to draw the attention of the United \r\nNations and influential actors to the illegal, invalid \r\narchaeological excavations around the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque and to obtain their good offices so as to put an \r\nend to them. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco follows with great \r\nconcern the difficult situation in the brotherly country \r\nof Iraq and calls upon the various sects and factions to \r\nallow the virtues of wisdom and clear-sightedness to \r\nprevail, through serious dialogue and national \r\nreconciliation with the aim of preserving the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and in order \r\nto put an end to the cycle of violence threatening its \r\nstability, security and its unity. \r\n Finally, I wish to recall that the world is \r\nundergoing considerable changes and is confronted \r\nwith numerous serious and global challenges, such as \r\nclimate change, which is the main topic of this annual \r\nsession. All these challenges call for multilateral \r\ninstitutions that are able to establish effective \r\nmultilateral cooperation and coordination among States \r\nto promote coherence and synergy among the various \r\nnational and regional initiatives. Hence the crucial \r\nimportance of a stronger United Nations that enjoys the \r\nconfidence and commitment of its Member States and \r\nA/62/PV.13 \r\n \r\n07-52299 42 \r\n \r\ntheir support in order to make a success of its reform \r\nprogramme. The Organization also needs to strengthen \r\nits credibility in order to harmonize its agenda with our \r\ncrucial priorities and with the need to ensure a better \r\nfuture for humanity within the framework of more \r\nbalanced, interdependent and tolerant international \r\nrelations. \r\n The President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. May I remind members that, in \r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five \r\nminutes for the second intervention and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nheard again a number of absurd distortions and \r\nbaseless allegations against my country by the \r\nrepresentative of the Zionist regime, a regime which \r\nhas based its policies, practices and behaviour on \r\noccupation, State terrorism, violence and bloodshed. I \r\nwould like to place on record that my delegation rejects \r\nthose baseless allegations and distortions and also \r\nstresses that this is yet another preposterous and indeed \r\nwell-worn practice by this regime to distract the \r\ninternational community’s attention from its criminal \r\npolicies and abhorrent atrocities in Palestine and \r\nelsewhere in the region. \r\n It is evident that no amount of slander or \r\ndeception or a smear campaign by the Zionist regime \r\ncan cloud the obvious fact that the regime poses the \r\nsole and the most real, serious and urgent threat that \r\nthe world and the region are facing today. It is \r\ntherefore imperative for the international community to \r\ncounter such a threat decisively. Moreover, that regime \r\npersists in its systematic and intentional defiance of \r\nmany international laws and norms as well as dozens \r\nof United Nations resolutions, as is known to all. \r\n In that context it suffices to refer briefly to the \r\nabhorrent policies and practices of that regime as far as \r\nhuman rights and weapons of mass destruction are \r\nconcerned. The record of that regime on issues such as \r\nState terrorism and suppression of people living under \r\nits brutal occupation is well known and needs no \r\nelaboration. The appalling and notorious record of the \r\nZionist regime’s violations of all human rights — first \r\nand foremost the right to life as the most basic human \r\nright — is well documented by many international \r\nhuman rights bodies and organizations, especially the \r\nUnited Nations human rights machinery. The ill-\r\nintended and futile attempts of that regime to raise \r\nallegations against others regarding human rights \r\nsituations is nothing but a ridiculous practice to distract \r\nthe attention of the international community from its \r\nshameful human rights record. \r\n On the question of the defiance of international \r\nlaw, particular reference should also be made to its \r\nconcealment and unabated pursuance of nuclear \r\narsenals during the past several decades. The Prime \r\nMinister of the Zionist regime’s acknowledgement of \r\nthe unlawful possession of nuclear weapons in his \r\ninterview with a German television channel on \r\n11 December 2006 revealed the real nature of that \r\ndeceptive regime’s clandestine nuclear activities, \r\nwhich pose a serious and continuing threat to \r\ninternational as well as regional peace and security.  \r\n It is undisputable that nuclear weapons in the \r\nhands of a regime marked with a long catalogue of \r\nvarious crimes, such as State terrorism, aggression and \r\noccupation, present a real threat to regional and \r\ninternational peace and security, and thus require \r\nurgent and decisive action by the international \r\ncommunity. Indeed, that regime should face a united \r\nfront and must be kept under continuous pressure to \r\nrelinquish its terrorist acts and its nuclear programme, \r\nand to place all its nuclear facilities under international \r\nmonitoring.  \r\n Mr. Botora (Ethiopia): The Foreign Minister of \r\nEritrea, in his statement this afternoon, once again \r\nlevelled accusations against Ethiopia about the lack of \r\nprogress in the implementation of the Eritrea-Ethiopia \r\nBoundary Commission’s delimitation decision for \r\nborder demarcation and in the peace process. It is no \r\nsurprise at all for delegations familiar with general \r\ndebates in the past to hear such baseless accusations \r\nfrom Eritrea. What the Foreign Minister said, in view \r\nof the actions taken by Eritrea for quite some time, is \r\nnothing but an insult to the intelligence of the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n Eritrea moved its armed forces into the \r\ndemilitarized zone known as the Temporary Security \r\nZone — from which Ethiopia had willingly withdrawn \r\nits troops — displacing United Nations peacekeeping \r\nForces and violating the Algiers Agreements of 2000. \r\nNot only does Eritrea continue to violate the \r\nAgreements and defy Security Council resolutions, \r\n A/62/PV.13\r\n \r\n43 07-52299 \r\n \r\nwhich urged it to withdraw its forces and create the \r\nnecessary condition for demarcation to begin, but, on \r\nthe contrary, it has increased its military presence in \r\nthe demilitarized zone by adding heavy military \r\nequipment and military personnel, as confirmed by the \r\nrecent report of the Secretary-General to the Security \r\nCouncil dated 30 April 2007 (S/2007/250).  \r\n As a result, today there is no demilitarized zone \r\nthat can separate the two armies and allow the border \r\ndemarcation process to begin. Instead of complying \r\nwith the Algiers Agreements and Security Council \r\nresolutions, Eritrea has reinforced its military presence \r\nin the demilitarized zone, thereby making it completely \r\nnon-existent and further strengthening the already \r\nsevere restrictions imposed on the freedom of \r\nmovement and monitoring operations of the United \r\nNations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).  \r\n My Government, therefore, in view of the \r\nflagrant violations of the Algiers Agreements, has sent \r\nnotification to Eritrea reminding it that unless its forces \r\nare withdrawn completely from the Temporary Security \r\nZone, allowing UNMEE to carry out its monitoring \r\nmandate, Ethiopia has the inherent right to invoke all \r\npeaceful and legal measures.  \r\n Ethiopia has accepted the Boundary \r\nCommission’s delimitation decision without condition. \r\nEthiopia remains committed to the objectives and the \r\npurpose of the Algiers Agreements. Ethiopia will \r\ncontinue to cooperate with all concerned parties with a \r\nview to bringing about sustainable peace and avoiding \r\nanother crisis.  \r\n What the Foreign Minister said with regard to \r\nEthiopia’s presence in Somalia was a pure fabrication \r\ndevoid of an iota of truth. It is abundantly obvious to \r\nthe international community and to the General \r\nAssembly that Ethiopia is in Somalia upon the request \r\nof the legitimate Transitional Federal Government of \r\nSomalia and its parliament. Ethiopia has no separate \r\nagenda in Somalia, other than that of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, the \r\nAfrican Union and the Security Council, which is to \r\nsupport and assist the legitimate Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment and the federal institutions in their efforts \r\nto bring about stability and sustainable peace in the \r\ncountry.  \r\n It is Eritrea that is actively destabilizing Somalia \r\nby training, equipping, financing and politically and \r\ndiplomatically supporting well-known international \r\nterrorists, including those appearing on the \r\nconsolidated list of the Security Council. The Security \r\nCouncil Monitoring Group on Somalia, in its recent \r\nreport to the Council (S/2007/436, enclosure), \r\nconfirmed that Eritrea is a conduit for arms to the \r\nterrorists in Somalia, who aim to destabilize the \r\ncountry and the region as a whole. It is therefore the \r\nresponsibility of the international community to take \r\nappropriate action against Eritrea to stop its \r\ndestabilizing acts in support of international terrorists \r\nin Somalia and throughout our region.  \r\n The meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.  \r\n \r\n"
