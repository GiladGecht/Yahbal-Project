(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Maxime Bernier, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCanada. \r\n Mr. Bernier (Canada) (spoke in French): It is an \r\nhonour for me to speak before this Assembly. The \r\nUnited Nations is the very embodiment of the \r\ncommitment we have all made to contribute to peace \r\nand security and to create better living conditions in a \r\ngreater climate of freedom. For its part, the \r\nGovernment I represent has never ceased strengthening \r\nits actions in the international arena. The Canadian \r\nGovernment is a responsible partner and a fully \r\nengaged Power. We are guided by unwavering \r\nprinciples. Canada’s commitment is not only linked to \r\nour interests, but above all to the values that inspire \r\nCanadians, which are freedom, the rule of law, \r\ndemocracy and human rights. They are the values \r\nunderlying our presence in Afghanistan, in Haiti, in the \r\nSudan and elsewhere in the world.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nAnd they are the values and aspirations that are \r\nembodied in the Preamble to the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights: the inherent dignity and the rights of \r\nall members of the human family are the foundation of \r\nfreedom, justice and peace. Article 1 of the Declaration \r\nsays further “All human beings are born free and equal \r\nin dignity and rights”.  \r\n Those are not abstract concepts. They are real and \r\nconcrete concepts with effects both immediate and \r\nprofound. Promoting them is not enough. They must be \r\nprotected and defended, particularly when they are \r\nunder assault — in Burma, in Afghanistan, in the \r\nSudan, in Iran and elsewhere. \r\n In Kabul, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has \r\nconfirmed the desire of the United Nations to stabilize \r\nAfghanistan. Canada has engaged its political \r\ncommitment and practical capabilities to rebuild \r\nsecurity, democracy, human rights and prosperity in \r\nthat country.  \r\n Canada believes that a united international \r\ncommunity must support efforts to rebuild Afghanistan. \r\nInternational organizations, including the United \r\nNations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the \r\nWorld Bank, must work towards that common goal. No \r\none country can do that alone. To fully implement \r\nSecurity Council decisions, we must work in close \r\npartnership, both with the Government of Afghanistan \r\nand with our friends and allies. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n To ensure a successful commitment, Canada \r\ndeploys the necessary resources, as with our mission in \r\nAfghanistan. Under the terms of a clear United Nations \r\nmandate, Canada joined the coalition of the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. \r\nMore than 60 countries and international organizations \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 2 \r\n \r\nhave undertaken with us to help the democratically \r\nelected Afghan Government rebuild its country. \r\n Canada believes that the efforts of the countries \r\nand organizations working in Afghanistan are \r\ncommendable and also reflect the core principles \r\nespoused by the United Nations. The challenge is great, \r\nbut the principles we are defending are greater still. \r\n The countries assisting Afghanistan are united by \r\na single conviction: there can be no reconstruction \r\nwithout security. Democracy and political stability \r\ncannot flourish in a climate of terror. Health care and \r\neducation cannot be provided where anarchy prevails. \r\nEconomic development is impossible when chaos is all \r\naround. Security is the crucial foundation on which \r\neverything depends, but long-term security requires \r\nsustainable investment in the country’s development; \r\none goes hand in hand with the other. \r\n Thanks to the assistance of Canada and the \r\ninternational community, Afghanistan has made \r\nprogress. Afghan police officers are currently being \r\ntrained, Afghan refugees are returning home and \r\nAfghan children are learning to read and write. Canada \r\nis having a real and direct impact on the lives of the \r\nAfghan people and is contributing to the achievement \r\nof the vision of the future expressed in the Afghanistan \r\nCompact which was signed in 2006. In order to make \r\nthat vision a reality, it is crucial that the United Nations \r\nand the Government of Afghanistan ensure the \r\nfulfilment of the Compact. And yes, despite the \r\nincidents of intimidation and violence, the situation of \r\nthe Afghan people is improving.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Last year, Prime Minister Harper emphasized \r\nhere that the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan was the most important special political \r\nmission of the United Nations. The Canadian \r\nGovernment continues to support the leadership role of \r\nthe United Nations in Afghanistan. For that reason, \r\nCanada supports having a new high-level United \r\nNations special envoy for Afghanistan. \r\n In the past year, our Government has \r\ndemonstrated its multifaceted commitment to that \r\nmission. We have increased our development spending, \r\nour diplomatic presence and our military engagement. \r\nWe welcome Security Council resolution 1776 (2007). \r\nIt extends the authorization of the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force in Afghanistan and calls on \r\nMember States to contribute personnel, equipment and \r\nfunding. The Canadian Government encourages \r\nmembers of the Assembly to actively support that \r\nresolution and its implementation. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n There are other challenges we must also meet. In \r\nHaiti, the Canadian Government has asked the Security \r\nCouncil to extend the mandate of the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti. That represents \r\nCanada’s most substantial development programme \r\nand its largest stabilization mission in the Americas. \r\n In Burma, it is imperative to restore democracy \r\nand human rights. We expect the United Nations to be \r\nat the forefront of those efforts. Although we have \r\ndisagreed on occasion with the decisions and processes \r\nof the United Nations Human Rights Council, the \r\nconvening of a special session of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil on Burma is an example of the sort of activism \r\nand engagement that Canada expects of that body, \r\nespecially in dealing with countries that perpetuate \r\nhuman rights violations. \r\n In the Sudan, innovative peacekeeping missions \r\nare creating a security framework which will become \r\nthe foundation upon which a durable peace can be \r\nbuilt. The international community must demonstrate \r\nthe political will to find new solutions. Those solutions \r\nmust be aimed not only at immediately ending the \r\nhorrific violations of human rights occurring daily in \r\nDarfur, but also at addressing the issues of freedom and \r\ndemocracy that must form the foundation for a durable \r\npeace. Canada’s substantial contribution to the Sudan \r\ncontinues in the form of humanitarian assistance and \r\nequipment. Of course, we condemn the intolerable \r\nattack against soldiers of the African Union force. \r\n The scope of the challenges we must overcome to \r\nmaintain our security is such that no country can hope \r\nto tackle them alone. We, the Member States, can and \r\nmust show the determination and political will so that \r\nthe United Nations may truly reflect the principles that \r\nits founders wanted it to embody. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Canada is and will remain a committed partner \r\nfor all those who seek to work for freedom, to work for \r\ndemocracy and to work for human rights and the rule \r\nof law. \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n3 07-52428 \r\n \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Raphael Tuju, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Kenya. \r\n Mr. Tuju (Kenya): It is my very great pleasure to \r\naddress the General Assembly. I join other speakers in \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly. My delegation \r\nhas every confidence in your ability to discharge this \r\nchallenge. I assure you of our support.  \r\n I commend your predecessor, Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, for ably steering the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I would also like to \r\ntake this opportunity to once again congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General on his appointment. My delegation \r\nwelcomes his commitment to strengthen the pillars of \r\nthe United Nations: security, development and human \r\nrights. \r\n Last year, when I had the privilege of addressing \r\nthe Assembly, I dwelt on the issue of Somalia and how \r\nthe dynamic in that country had an impact in our \r\ncapitals and cities around the world, such as Toronto, \r\nStockholm, Rome, Nairobi and Mogadishu. Even \r\ncountries that are thousands of miles away and whose \r\ninteraction with Somalia has been minimal have been \r\nforced to awaken to the reality that we have become a \r\nglobal village when their citizens plying international \r\nwaters have been hijacked or robbed by pirates in the \r\nIndian Ocean along the coast of Somalia. \r\n Let me thank the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council for listening to our pleas from the \r\nregion. I appeal for closer collaboration by the \r\ninternational community in addressing the complex and \r\ndifficult problems of Somalia. Yet, within all these \r\nchallenges, there are several windows of opportunity \r\nthat we must take advantage of to prevent extreme \r\nhuman suffering, especially of women and children, in \r\nthat sister country. \r\n Mr. Romero-Martínez (Honduras), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n My delegation commends the African Union for \r\nits support for the African Union Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM). We pay special tribute to the Ugandan \r\ntroops for the important role they are playing in \r\nSomalia under very trying circumstances. We appeal \r\nfor the deployment of the remaining peacekeeping \r\ntroops to strengthen AMISOM. Kenya also urges the \r\nUnited Nations to assume greater responsibility in \r\nSomalia in line with Security Council resolution 1772 \r\n(2007). A United Nations presence on the ground in \r\nSomalia would complement regional and international \r\nefforts to promote peace, stability and reconciliation in \r\nthat country. \r\n Kenya unequivocally supports national \r\nreconciliation in Somalia. We see it as a process, not a \r\nsingle event. We urge all the political actors that \r\nhitherto boycotted the talks to embrace the process, \r\nbecause, no matter how long it takes, the final \r\nresolution of the Somalia crisis will only come about \r\nwhen all Somalis agree to sit down and talk. The \r\nregion and the international community can only \r\nprovide support. Ultimately, it is the people of Somalia \r\nwho can resolve their difference through a spirit of \r\ngive and take. For our part, as the international \r\ncommunity, we must honour our pledges to provide the \r\nnecessary resources to Somalia. The problem with \r\nSomalia may be less visible today, probably because it \r\nhas been overshadowed by the conflict in Darfur, but \r\nthe Somalia crisis is far from over. \r\n According to the Human Security Report 2005, \r\nthe number of armed conflicts in the world has fallen \r\nby over 40 per cent during the past 13 years. The \r\nreport’s overall conclusion that conflict is becoming \r\nless common in the world in general as well as in \r\nAfrica is very encouraging. Conflict is a major \r\ndisincentive to investment and poses an intolerable \r\nburden in terms of human suffering. The end of wars in \r\nSierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, Burundi, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Southern Sudan \r\nis a welcome development in Africa. \r\n While we may celebrate the end of those wars, it \r\nis imperative that the international community make \r\nthe urgent and essential investments that will \r\ncontribute to the prevention of recurrence of such \r\nconflicts. The local populations should experience \r\npeace dividends so as to sustain peace. \r\n Kenya urges a strengthening of partnerships \r\nbetween the African Union and the United Nations \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations in the area of \r\npolitical and technical cooperation, as well as \r\npartnerships with the continent’s subregional \r\norganizations. The African Union’s peacekeeping \r\ncapabilities and capacity must be strengthened through \r\nprovision of financial, technical and logistical support. \r\nThe recent deaths of many African Union soldiers in \r\nDarfur underline the urgency of the need for logistical \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 4 \r\n \r\nsupport by the United Nations to African Union \r\nmissions within the agreed-upon frameworks. In this \r\nregard, my delegation welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to provide assistance to the African \r\nUnion to enhance its military capabilities and \r\nmediation role in conflict resolution. \r\n The United Nations has deployed a lot of time \r\nand resources in the area of disarmament and \r\ndevelopment. The proliferation of illicit small arms and \r\nlight weapons in the Horn of Africa continues to \r\nundermine our security and development. It has \r\ncontributed to making our neighbourhood a very tough \r\none. \r\n In order to address this challenge, the States of \r\nthe region rallied together in 2000 to sign the Nairobi \r\nDeclaration on the Problem of the Proliferation of \r\nIllicit Small Arms and Light Weapons in the Great \r\nLakes Region and the Horn of Africa. The Declaration \r\nwas upgraded in 2004 to a legally binding Protocol, the \r\nfirst intergovernmental instrument of its kind to \r\naddress the proliferation of small arms. In 2005, the \r\nProtocol established the Regional Centre on Small \r\nArms and Light Weapons (RECSA), with the main \r\nobjective of providing a comprehensive framework to \r\ncombat the availability of illicit small arms and light \r\nweapons in the region. In view of the importance of the \r\nCentre, Kenya has requested the inclusion of an item in \r\nthe agenda of this session of the General Assembly to \r\ninvite RECSA to participate in the work of the \r\nAssembly as an observer. Addressing the problem of \r\nthe proliferation of small arms is important; we are up \r\nagainst the very powerful international vested interests \r\nof small arms manufacturers and traders. \r\n Kenya was among the six sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution on the arms trade treaty that was \r\noverwhelmingly adopted during the last session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as resolution 61/89. In that \r\nresolution, the General Assembly requested that the \r\nSecretary-General, among other things, seek the views \r\nof Member States on the feasibility, scope and draft \r\nparameters for a legally binding arms trade treaty. We \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for the progress made \r\nso far in the implementation of that resolution. We look \r\nforward to the establishment of a group of \r\nGovernmental experts to begin work next year and to \r\nthe group’s report to the General Assembly at its next \r\nsession.  \r\n I recently had occasion to address a group of my \r\nfellow Foreign Ministers from our close neighbour, \r\nEurope, on a couple of subjects that increasingly define \r\nour relationship with the rest of the world, among them \r\nillegal immigration. It is one of the ironies of history \r\nthat there was a time when my brothers and sisters who \r\nwere unlucky and could not run fast enough were \r\ncaught as slaves and shipped across the oceans in very \r\ninhuman conditions. A large number died during the \r\njourney as they were sent to different parts of the world \r\nto provide slave labour. \r\n Today, many of my brothers and sisters are often \r\nvoluntarily offering themselves and handing over their \r\nlife savings to be shipped across oceans in almost \r\nsimilar inhuman conditions. Many of them have lost \r\ntheir lives during the journey. They play cat and \r\nmouse, attempting to avoid border patrols equipped \r\nwith tracer dogs and electronic monitoring, so as to get \r\na chance to slave most of their lives in the minimum-\r\nwage bracket. \r\n The clock has ticked full circle. But a lot has \r\nchanged as well. And I come back to my assertion that \r\ndistances between us have shrunk and we must now \r\nrecognize that, in this global village, a phenomenon \r\nsuch as economic refugees is going to be a cause of \r\ntrauma in our communities. You can build great walls, \r\nintroduce and increase more menacing border patrols \r\nand make your immigration meaner, but the respite can \r\nonly be temporary. You can whip up xenophobic \r\nsentiment, especially around national election times. \r\nBut that amounts to an ineffectual Band-Aid and does \r\nnot address the fundamentals of the crisis we are facing \r\ntoday. \r\n Even in the most developed countries, unless a \r\nsociety addresses the problems and stress in the poor \r\nneighbourhoods and inner cities, any solution like \r\nmigration into the suburbs and the construction of \r\ngated communities will only provide some temporary \r\nrelief. Crime will continue unabated. Muggings, \r\ncarjackings, kidnappings and other violent crime will \r\ncontinue to prevail. We have to address the \r\nfundamental problems in our poor neighbourhoods not \r\njust for the sake of those living in those \r\nneighbourhoods but also for the sake of those who live \r\nin relatively affluent areas. \r\n What I am talking about is not really rocket \r\nscience or some very complex social engineering \r\nconcept. It should be clear to all of us that, in the \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n5 07-52428 \r\n \r\nglobal village that we have come to be, it is in the \r\ninterest of all of us to work together to address the \r\nconspiracy of factors that create so much stress and \r\ntension within and among our countries. We must be \r\nlevel-headed enough to recognize that angry \r\nunemployed young men in one country will spill over \r\nsooner or later into other countries’ capitals and create \r\nproblems. \r\n If nothing else, the phenomenon of global climate \r\nchange should teach us the lesson that our destinies as \r\nhuman beings are inextricably intertwined. Vehicular \r\nemissions in New York do the same thing to our village \r\nEarth as our cutting of equatorial forests in Africa to \r\nmake charcoal. Both actions may introduce incidents of \r\nfloods due climate change all the way over in distant \r\nChina. \r\n As neighbours in the global village, it is certainly \r\na good thing if we both come to recognize that if \r\nwealthy countries’ policies and actions confine us to \r\nabject poverty, then it is only a matter of time before \r\nthe stress in my country will spill over into their \r\nneighbourhood — maybe in the form of illegal \r\nimmigration, terrorism or whatever. However, sooner \r\nor later we all have to pay for the consequences of \r\nselfish and short-sighted policies of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund \r\n(IMF) and the World Bank. \r\n It is therefore important that as we talk about \r\nreform and paradigm shifts in any of these \r\ninternational institutions we should adopt the right \r\nattitude: that nobody is doing the other a favour. We \r\nare in this small boat called Earth together. When the \r\npowerful think that they are playing their advantage in \r\nthe global scene and winning the battles, such victory \r\ncan only be temporary. The only real victory is when it \r\nis a win-win outcome. The other outcome, when a large \r\npart of the world emerges as losers, is unsustainable. It \r\nbreeds anger and vengeance. \r\n Most of the resources and capacity to change our \r\nworld for the better are domiciled in the developed \r\nworld. The resources needed are more than enough in \r\nthe more endowed countries. The knowledge of what \r\nwe must do to make a positive difference is simple and \r\nevident. Yet as world leaders we must bear the \r\ncollective guilt of failing to focus on providing the \r\nsolutions. \r\n I come from a country in a region, for example, \r\nwhere factors such as poverty and lack of education \r\nconspire to stress and destabilize our communities and \r\ncountries. There is an autocatalytic relationship \r\nbetween poverty and low education. Those who have \r\nlow education tend to become poorer. And those who \r\nare poorer tend to have low education. There is also a \r\ncorrelation between poverty and low formal education, \r\non one side, and inter-ethnic, clan, religious and even \r\nracial tension, on the other side. This invariably leads \r\nto unstable societies. \r\n When people are poor and less educated, their \r\nreference point tends to become only their ethnic, clan, \r\nreligious or racial identity. With a few exceptions, the \r\neducated and affluent are at least able to operate at a \r\nhigher level. A doctor, a lawyer, a teacher or an \r\nengineer is usually less xenophobic. \r\n In Kenya, we understand this, and therefore we \r\nunderstand the importance of education. We have \r\ninvested up to 30 per cent of our annual budget to \r\nprovide free primary education. Next year, we will \r\nhave free secondary education. That is the type of \r\nsocial and economic investment we all must make now \r\nif we expect to have a better, more prosperous and \r\nmore stable world 10 years from now. We may make \r\nfine speeches and express a commitment to creating a \r\nsafer, friendlier and more prosperous world. But as \r\nlong as we fail to make the right investment in \r\neducation and poverty alleviation, we are only engaged \r\nin empty talk. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \r\nimportant medium- and long-term goals — 10 years in \r\nscope, usually. However, our democracies operate on a \r\nshorter calendar of four or five years. In both the \r\ndeveloped and the less developed countries, many of \r\nthe leaders tend to do what they must to survive and \r\nsucceed in the next elections. Even with best of \r\nintentions, the nature and scope of the challenges of \r\ndevelopment that we must address cannot be \r\nadequately solved with official development assistance \r\n(ODA) programmes that are implemented and \r\ncompleted within the political calendar of changing \r\nregimes. We need more paradigm shifts and a longer-\r\nterm vision in that regard. \r\n In conclusion, many of our countries are now \r\ncrashing under the weight of international debt. Those \r\nwho have actually crashed are the ones that have been \r\nextended a parachute after they have crashed. I am \r\namazed by this undertaker mentality. \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 6 \r\n \r\n I do not wish to blame the current generation of \r\nleaders in the developed countries for the status quo. I \r\nknow that there is some financial and economic \r\nprinciple here. Most of the current leaders in these \r\ncountries are innocent. The deals that were cut in the \r\npast, which put us in the kind of debt we are in today, \r\nare no longer in place. But I feel I must say that the \r\nload and the burden of our international debt is heavy \r\nand debilitating. A lot of it should not have been \r\nundertaken on in the first place; there is some \r\ncomplicity in the dishonesty on both sides that \r\nprevailed before we, today’s leaders, came onto the \r\nscene. \r\n It is important that today we secure the future of \r\nall our children, who must share this increasingly \r\nintertwined world. We must put behind us those \r\nnegative things, such as the unjustified debts of the \r\npast, that can only breed anger and bitterness and affect \r\nfuture generations. We must make the sacrifices and \r\nthe investment today for the future of humanity. That \r\nwould be a favour to all of us, and not just to one \r\ngroup. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Basile Ikouebe, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and la \r\nFrancophonie of the Republic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): As he \r\nhad to leave New York earlier than scheduled owing to \r\npressing engagements, President Denis Sassou \r\nNguesso has asked me to address the Assembly on his \r\nbehalf in order to share with other Member States the \r\nperspectives of the Congolese Government on items on \r\nthe General Assembly’s agenda at this session. \r\n On behalf of my delegation, I wish first to thank \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain for her \r\nexcellent work. I also thank the President on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. The five priorities that he has \r\narticulated and the road map for climate change, the \r\ndrafting of which he announced at his election, \r\nrepresent an agenda that is in line with the objectives \r\nthat have been pursued by the United Nations since the \r\nMillennium Summit of September 2000. He can rely \r\non my delegation’s cooperation when we consider \r\nthose issues. \r\n To Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in his first experience of \r\nthe General Assembly’s general debate as Secretary-\r\nGeneral, I reaffirm my Government’s commitment to \r\nassisting him in the direction he seeks to set for our \r\nOrganization. My country is sensitive to the many \r\ndisplays of interest in us that he has demonstrated time \r\nand time again since his election last year. Proof of \r\nthat, inter alia, are the visit he made to Brazzaville in \r\nJanuary 2007 and his choice of a son of our country, \r\nMr. Rodolphe Adada, former Foreign Minister of the \r\nCongo, to direct the African Union-United Nations \r\nHybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). We are very \r\ngrateful to him for that. \r\n Following the violent crises that shook our nation \r\nin the late 1990s, the Congo has gradually found peace \r\nand stability through political dialogue and national \r\nreconciliation, which remain our ongoing objectives. \r\nThe return of a number of Congolese who left the \r\ncountry during the civil wars is part of that positive \r\ntrend. The legislative elections that have just been held \r\npeacefully are indeed the sign of a democracy at peace. \r\nThat favourable dynamic needs, of course, to be \r\nencouraged, assisted and supported by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Despite enormous losses in human life and \r\nconsiderable material damage, at the end of the civil \r\nwar the Congo was not considered to be a country in a \r\npost-conflict situation. We had to undertake at our own \r\nexpense the vast task of restoration and reconstruction. \r\nWe therefore plunged resolutely into difficult \r\nnegotiations with the Bretton Woods institutions to \r\nelaborate a programme of debt relief, implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals — including the \r\nfight against poverty — and economic recovery. In that \r\ncontext, in order not to exacerbate further the daily \r\nexistence of the majority of our people already living \r\nwithout the basic necessities, we are trying to prevent \r\nthe negotiations from being an intolerable burden on \r\nthem. We therefore hope to bring the negotiations to a \r\nconclusion as soon as possible so as not to delay the \r\nimplementation of the necessary reforms. \r\n The return to peace and stability has allowed my \r\ncountry to resume its place on the international stage. \r\nIn less than three months, the Congo will end its term \r\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council. \r\nFor the past 20 months, we have participated in the \r\nCouncil’s deliberations in a constructive spirit. We \r\nhave always favoured the resolution of disputes \r\nthrough peaceful means and dialogue, seeking \r\ncompromise and enhanced multilateralism. Our \r\nparticipation has strengthened our belief in the need \r\nand urgency of reform of that main organ of the United \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n7 07-52428 \r\n \r\nNations, entrusted with the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Our position and that \r\nof Africa is well known on that question. We have also \r\nfocused on improving the Council’s working methods \r\nin order to ensure greater transparency and \r\ninclusiveness in its decision-making process. \r\n During the presidency of the African Union \r\nassumed by Congolese President Denis Sassou \r\nNguesso in 2006, the Congo had occasion to speak on \r\nbehalf of a continent whose issues occupy the lion’s \r\nshare of the Council’s agenda. We made the case for \r\nstrengthening the partnership between the United \r\nNations and the African Union in order to ensure that \r\nthe Council’s decisions take the concerns of African \r\ncountries into consideration and are thereby legitimate \r\nand viable. We called for ongoing dialogue between the \r\nCouncil, on the one hand, and the African Union, \r\nthrough its Peace and Security Council, and African \r\nStates as a whole, on the other, as well as parties to \r\nconflicts.  \r\n We encouraged the international community to \r\nremain involved in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo through the United Nations Organization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nincluding after the elections, which clearly represented \r\na great step forward but left unresolved the questions \r\nof peace in the East, the disarmament of armed groups, \r\nthe repatriation of foreign combatants and economic \r\nreconstruction. Such developments could be facilitated \r\nin the context of the pact signed at the conclusion of \r\nthe second summit of the International Conference on \r\nthe Great Lakes Region, which is an appropriate \r\nregional framework. \r\n In the Côte d’Ivoire, after much uncertainty, it is \r\ncomforting to note that the process engaged by the \r\nOuagadougou agreement has opened prospects for a \r\nresolution of the crisis, which we need to encourage \r\nand assist.  \r\n The same prospects for encouraging \r\ndevelopments are now open to Darfur following the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). \r\nIn his statement to the Council summit of \r\n25 September, the Congolese Head of State called on \r\nthe international community to seize this opportunity to \r\nact with a sense of urgency.  \r\n We must accelerate the pace of work in the \r\nfollowing three areas, as emerged from the high-level \r\nmeeting on Darfur held here in New York on \r\n21 September. First, political dialogue is to resume on \r\n27 October in Tripoli, where all parties must \r\nparticipate, bearing in mind the exceptional open-\r\nmindedness of the Sudanese Government, which has \r\ndecided to observe a ceasefire once the Tripoli talks \r\nbegin. Sanctions should be considered for all reticent \r\nparties. To encourage the initiative of political \r\ndialogue, which will determine any possible success \r\nfor the international community’s involvement in \r\nDarfur, my Government has decided to contribute to \r\nthe special Trust Fund created by the Secretary-General \r\nto that end. \r\n Secondly, peace must be maintained via the \r\ndeployment of UNAMID. The creation of the force was \r\na most significant decision that must be implemented \r\nwithout delay in order to avoid any political setback \r\nand any deterioration of the situation on the ground. In \r\nthat area, too, my Government has demonstrated its \r\nsolidarity by deciding to dispatch a contingent, along \r\nwith the military observers it sent earlier as part of the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in Sudan. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation vigorously condemns the recent attack on \r\nthe African Union peacekeepers in Haskanita in \r\nsouthern Darfur. We ask that the perpetrators be \r\nactively sought and punished. \r\n Thirdly, humanitarian assistance and economic \r\nrecovery are more than indispensable to stabilization \r\nand a return to normalcy in Darfur. With respect to \r\nAfrican crises, we cannot ignore the tragedy of \r\nSomalia. As we all know, Africa has committed to \r\ndeploying the Africa Union Military Observer Mission \r\nin Somalia, which should be vigorously supported and \r\nultimately relieved by a United Nations force. Somalia \r\nmust not become a forgotten crisis. The Somalis \r\nthemselves, however, must assume their \r\nresponsibilities and make a serious commitment to an \r\ninclusive political dialogue that will lead to genuine \r\nnational reconciliation. \r\n Until the end of this month, the Congo is the \r\nPresident of the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States. Our subregion has always been \r\ninvolved in international initiatives concerning the \r\nsituations in its various constituent countries. A \r\ncontingent put together by some of those countries is \r\ntherefore contributing to the stability of the situation in \r\nthe Central African Republic. The twenty-sixth meeting \r\nof the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on \r\nSecurity Questions in Central Africa, held in Yaoundé \r\non 7 September 2007, resulted in a series of \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 8 \r\n \r\nconclusions including, in particular, an appeal to the \r\ninternational community and the donors to help the \r\nGovernments of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and Chad secure their borders and improve \r\ngeneral security conditions; support for the \r\nmultidisciplinary operation to be deployed to secure \r\nthe situation in the areas of Chad and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic bordering the \r\nSudan — the subject of Security Council resolution \r\n1778 (2007), adopted on 25 September — and pursuing \r\nsubregional cooperation on questions of security, \r\nincluding the announcement of the military exercise of \r\na simulated peacekeeping operation, scheduled for \r\nChad in November.  \r\n And finally, still in Yaoundé, on the margins of \r\nthe meeting of the Advisory Committee, a ministerial \r\nconference on cross-border security questions in \r\nCentral Africa resulted in the adoption of a statement, \r\nwhich amounts to a political commitment, by the States \r\nin the subregion to implement organizational, \r\nadministrative, legal and technical mechanisms of \r\ncooperation in border areas. This will allow us to \r\ntackle such phenomena as uncontrolled or forced \r\nmovement of populations, criminal activities of armed \r\ngroups, illicit flows of small arms and light weapons \r\nand the illegal exploitation of natural resources.  \r\n My country also remains vigilant to the threats \r\nthat weigh on other parts of the world and crises that \r\nshake several regions around the globe. In this spirit, \r\nwe have always supported a peaceful settlement to the \r\nMiddle East conflict that takes into account the \r\nQuartet’s Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. We \r\nhave also called for an international conference on the \r\nMiddle East, with the participation of all countries in \r\nthe region that can make a useful contribution. We \r\ntherefore welcome with interest and hope the \r\nannouncement of the November conference on the \r\nMiddle East.  \r\n In terms of nuclear non-proliferation, we have \r\nalways called for compliance with the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty in all its aspects, including \r\nthe right of all countries to develop nuclear technology \r\nfor civil purposes. We have always insisted on the \r\ncrucial role of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\nand on the need for a political dialogue with the \r\ncountries whose nuclear programs raise questions. In \r\nthis respect, we are pleased with the evolution of \r\nnegotiations with North Korea, and we encourage \r\npursuing dialogue with Iran to make sure that there is \r\nno slippage in the programme that country is \r\ndeveloping. \r\n My delegation is also pleased with the \r\nmobilization of the international community around a \r\nquestion crucial for the future of mankind: the real \r\nthreat of climate change. Now, thanks to science, it has \r\nbeen clearly established that it is human activity that is \r\nat the origin of this scourge. We agree with the \r\nSecretary-General and the President of the General \r\nAssembly that the time has come to act. Therefore, we \r\nwelcomed the high-level meeting held here on \r\n24 September on this theme. The President of the \r\nCongo personally participated in that meeting to show \r\nthe commitment of the countries of the Congo Basin — \r\nthe world’s second ecological lung, after the Amazon \r\nBasin — in the struggle for survival of our species and \r\nsafeguarding the planet overall. On the basis of a \r\nstrategic plan called the convergence plan, a ten-year \r\nplan, these countries have made a commitment to \r\nnational and subregional actions having to do with \r\nsustainable management of forest ecosystems in the \r\nBasin.  \r\n The awareness that we have a responsibility in \r\nthis common fight has led us to cooperate with the two \r\nother great forest areas — the Amazon and in \r\nBorneo — to promote better forestry and commercial \r\npractices. The talks that these three areas held on \r\n24 September, on the margins of the high-level \r\nmeeting, have permitted our delegations to prepare for \r\na common approach to be presented at the conference \r\nof the States parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change in Bali this December. \r\n Our constant commitment to peace and \r\ninternational security today includes many aspects. \r\nClimate change merits this special attention that this \r\nAssembly, as the world’s conscience, must give to \r\nthese great challenges confronting humanity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Reinaldo Gargano, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Eastern Republic of \r\nUruguay. \r\n Mr. Gargano (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwish to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session.  \r\n On behalf of my country, Uruguay, I would like \r\nto pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and to all of those \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n9 07-52428 \r\n \r\nwho today are paying their respects and are celebrating \r\nthis International Day of Non-Violence.  \r\n The Eastern Republic of Uruguay would like to \r\nbegin by reiterating its ongoing commitment to the \r\nprinciples and guidelines which are and will continue \r\nto be at the very core of its international activity: the \r\nsovereign equality of States, the rejection of the use of \r\nforce or the threat of the use of force, peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes, attachment to and \r\nsupport for institutions of international law, support for \r\ninternational law itself, non-intervention in the internal \r\naffairs of other States, the self-determination of \r\npeoples, the promotion of human rights, international \r\ncooperation in economic and social matters, and \r\nsupport for multilateralism and for the quest for \r\ncollective answers based on consensus and respect for \r\nlaw, and within the framework of the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter — which means the rejection \r\nof any attempt to impose the will of one State over that \r\nof others. \r\n Achieving these principles is sometimes impeded \r\nby the attitude of a few dominant States that impose \r\nillegitimate decisions, provoking conflicts that involve \r\na large part of humankind and affect the weakest \r\ncountries. But above all, they weaken the legal and \r\npolitical authority of the United Nations. It is clear \r\ntoday that lying behind those attitudes we can discern \r\nhegemonic economic interests.  \r\n In accordance with the suggestion of the \r\nPresident, we will address the proposed agenda, \r\nbeginning with climate change. \r\n At the High-level Dialogue here on \r\n24 September, Uruguay expressed its opinions and \r\nreferred to various aspects of this problem that lead to \r\na serious and paradoxical situation for less developed \r\ncountries: even though they do not contribute \r\nsignificantly to global warming, they are the ones that \r\nsuffer the most and are the most vulnerable to its \r\naffects.  \r\n Regrettably, as we all know, there are highly \r\nindustrialized countries responsible for emitting \r\nmillions of tons of gas that cause global warming and \r\nclimate change, which, however, do not seem ready to \r\nreduce their emissions nor to cooperate with the \r\ninternational community to compensate for these \r\neffects. We must call upon those countries to sign the \r\nKyoto Protocol and to contribute, in a way that is \r\nproportionate to their responsibility in generating this \r\nproblem, so that this struggle can be carried forward by \r\nall the nations of our planet in solidarity.  \r\n For basically agricultural and fishing countries \r\nsuch as Uruguay and many other undeveloped \r\ncountries, climate is a decisive factor for development. \r\nThe dramatic climate variations that are increasingly \r\nnotorious constitute a serious threat for their \r\npossibilities for progress and the well-being of their \r\npopulations. This is why our countries have affirmed \r\nthat temporary aid and depending on the goodwill of \r\nrich countries when faced with specific catastrophes \r\ndoes not accomplish much. Rather, we need effective \r\nmeasures to be adopted from now on to prevent these \r\ncatastrophes and commitments that are to be made now \r\nin order to avoid continuing to create the conditions \r\nthat produce these catastrophes. \r\n In considering the topic of financing for \r\ndevelopment, we should begin with the following \r\nquestion. What have been the causes of \r\nunderdevelopment, economic and political dependency \r\nand poverty for billions of people, most of whom live \r\nin the southern part of the planet?  \r\n Looking for such financing, we tend to \r\nimmediately think of financial organizations like the \r\nWorld Bank, or those which, in order to maintain \r\nbudgets — that is, economic and social programmes — \r\nreflecting fiscal imbalances, have for decades \r\nprescribed economic formulas, such as those applied \r\nby the International Monetary Fund, which instead of \r\nleading to development have destroyed the productive \r\napparatus of entire regions of the planet, thus \r\ngenerating unemployment, increasing poverty and \r\nconcentrating wealth.  \r\n My country, along with other countries of the \r\nSouth American region, the Cairns Group and the \r\nGroup of 22, has been saying for two decades that it is \r\nimportant to have just standards of trade rather than \r\npreaching about the unconditional opening of markets \r\non the pretext of free trade while simultaneously \r\npractising the crudest and most ruthless protection of \r\nthe world’s predominant systems of production and \r\nstubbornly refusing to comply with part V of the \r\nAgreement on Agriculture, annexed to the Marrakesh \r\nAgreement, whose objectives include the elimination \r\nof subsidies and the opening up of markets. \r\nUnfortunately, we have not managed to convince the \r\nUnited States and the European Union of this.  \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 10 \r\n \r\n To put it briefly and concisely, developing \r\ncountries do not need to be “helped”; they need \r\nguarantees of free access to markets and, in particular, \r\nthe elimination of domestic production subsidies, \r\nwhich violate the competitiveness guarantees, which \r\nare so highly touted. It is in agriculture that the \r\nsouthern countries are highly competitive and produce \r\nconsumer goods of high quality, generally free of \r\ngenetic modification. Real free trade would not make \r\nthem turn to international credit and would enable \r\nthem to generate their own resources to finance their \r\nown development, integrate their economies, to expand \r\ntheir markets, create their own multilateral credit \r\ninstitutions and diversify their products and, as a result, \r\ntheir markets.  \r\n Uruguay is the Chairman pro tempore of the \r\nCommon Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and we \r\nfirmly believe in the regional integration of all of the \r\ncountries of South America. That is their strategic \r\noption in foreign policy.  \r\n Our South America possesses all of the natural \r\nresources that we find in the world; we have energy \r\nreserves for more than 100 years; we have the potential \r\nto produce food for 4 billion people; we have the \r\nlargest global freshwater reserves; we have major \r\nmineral resources. Hence, we can make decisive \r\neconomic and social progress, with a view to \r\neliminating poverty.  \r\n But despite all of that, we face an absurd and \r\ncriminal situation: out of 400 million people in South \r\nAmerica, 200 million live under the poverty threshold; \r\nthere are areas of the continent where there are \r\nextremely high rates of infant mortality. Life \r\nexpectancy for part of that population is practically \r\nhalf of what it is in developed countries.  \r\n We cannot forget that in today’s world South \r\nAmerica is a factor of peace and political stability. All \r\nof the current Governments of South America have \r\nbeen democratically elected. Both in MERCOSUR and \r\nin its associated States, we have adopted the so-called \r\ndemocratic clause that says that a country can belong \r\nto these integration systems only if it respects \r\ndemocratic principles.  \r\n That is why, after 200 years of non-integration, \r\nwe will tenaciously defend that achievement — so that \r\nanti-democratic and destabilizing interference will fail \r\nand so that the continent of hope, as we call it, can \r\nhave an impact on the world to affirm peace and \r\nrespect for international law, democratic stability, \r\nfundamental freedoms and human rights, which with \r\ngreat sacrifice these people have recovered after \r\ndecades of a doctrine focusing on national security.  \r\n Uruguay reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). In order to \r\nachieve them, we need greater social justice, a better \r\ndistribution of wealth and the gradual establishment of \r\nnew criteria that would place the economy at the \r\nservice of humankind instead of being a factor of \r\nslavery and poverty for a large part of humankind — a \r\ntool that is used for the excessive enrichment of \r\nprivileged groups.  \r\n Our country knows the difficulties that all \r\ndeveloping nations face in working towards those \r\nobjectives. The current Uruguayan Government \r\ninherited a country that had experienced the worst \r\ncrisis in its history, with levels of poverty affecting \r\n1 million people out of a population of 3.5 million \r\npeople; in tens of thousands of cases poverty reached \r\nthe levels of abject poverty. All of this was the result of \r\nthe application of a foreign economic model which was \r\ncontrary to the interests of the region and its people.  \r\n Tackling this reality meant not only medium-term \r\nand long-term productive development measures, but \r\nalso emergency social measures. Thus, in 2005 we \r\nimplemented an emergency plan which in two years \r\nreduced the number of poor by 120,000, eliminated \r\nabject poverty and helped to socially reintegrate a large \r\npercentage of those who had been affected.  \r\n The Government is moving forward with a social \r\nequity plan, which involves the integration of more \r\nthan 500,000 people — one seventh of the \r\npopulation — into the national health system, which is \r\nalso being substantially modified. It also includes \r\nbenefits of roughly $40 per month to all children who \r\ngo to primary school and roughly $45 per month for \r\nthose who attend secondary or technical school. All of \r\nthis will help bring about a positive process of social \r\ninclusion.  \r\n Likewise, laws are being considered to transform \r\nthe entire educational sector and which are also aimed \r\nat achieving the MDGs. At present, school is \r\nmandatory from the age of 4 and special attention is \r\nbeing paid to dealing with the problem of dropouts. \r\n For Uruguay, no type of terrorism is acceptable or \r\njustifiable: neither State terrorism, which we \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n11 07-52428 \r\n \r\nexperienced during the 1970s and 1980s and which \r\nbecame a national security doctrine, nor the terrorism \r\nthat is practiced by some groups to further their social, \r\npolitical, religious or other demands, claiming victims \r\nwho, in the end, are always innocent people.  \r\n In the United Nations context, Uruguay is a party \r\nto all United Nations-system counter-terrorism \r\nconventions. We have submitted the relevant reports to \r\nall United Nations committees in this area.  \r\n Uruguay is concerned both by acts of terrorism \r\nand by their underlying causes. These include the \r\npromotion of hate based on cultural, political, racial or \r\nreligious differences; the talk of a so-called inevitable \r\nclash of civilizations; military invasions; and the \r\npersistence of difficult conditions for part of \r\npopulations living in occupied territories. \r\nInterventionism and non-compliance with United \r\nNations resolutions to resolve conflicts are causing an \r\nincrease in extremism and religious fanaticism among \r\nsuch peoples and seem to be the factors that have \r\ncontributed most to the worsening and proliferation of \r\nterrorist attacks.  \r\n Uruguay calls for all cultures and peoples to \r\ncome together in a respectful dialogue so that what is \r\ndifferent or foreign will not be a reason for aggression, \r\ndiscrimination, subjugation or hatred. We fully support \r\nthe initiative of Spain and Turkey: the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations.  \r\n In the view of Uruguay, peacekeeping in conflict \r\nzones is an essential mission not only of the United \r\nNations, but also of all countries wishing to cooperate \r\nin building a safer world where peace and cooperation \r\nare the norm. Our country currently takes part in 12 of \r\nthe 15 peacekeeping missions of the Organization \r\ndeployed in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Despite \r\nthe fact that we have only 3.5 million people, we are \r\nthe seventh largest troop contributor to those \r\noperations and we are the greatest per-capita troop \r\ncontributor in the world.  \r\n Uruguay has acquired experience in matters \r\nlinked to peacebuilding and reconstruction in areas \r\ndevastated by conflict, and offers electoral assistance \r\nto States as well. \r\n With respect to United Nations reform, Uruguay \r\nbelieves it is a priority to strengthen mechanisms to \r\neliminate the resort to preventive wars, interventionism \r\nand unilateral actions that are undertaken without \r\ntaking into account the opinion of the international \r\ncommunity. Uruguay also expresses its full support for \r\nthe new Human Rights Council, in which we have been \r\nhonoured to serve as one of the Vice-Presidents. With \r\nrespect to Security Council reform, we hope that in the \r\ncurrent session we will be able to move forward on the \r\nbasis of a consensus. Uruguay supports the inclusion of \r\nBrazil as a permanent member, as well as that of India, \r\nGermany and Japan, and an increase in the number of \r\nnon-permanent members.  \r\n The effectiveness of the United Nations is a topic \r\nthat concerns us. Uruguay is one of the countries that \r\nhave been chosen for the “One United Nations” pilot \r\nplan, within the framework of the recommendations of \r\nthe High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence. The \r\nGovernment of Uruguay has committed itself to \r\ncarrying out this pilot project in coordination with the \r\nUnited Nations agencies in Uruguay, defining three \r\nstrategic areas as the basis of that coordination: State \r\nreform, especially in health, education and \r\ndevelopment strategies; decentralized development, \r\nwith civic participation; and policies to eradicate \r\npoverty and structural inequities.  \r\n Lastly, Uruguay believes that all United Nations \r\nMember States must abandon patterns that date back to \r\nthe Second World War and develop organizational \r\nstandards for the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the other principal organs of the United \r\nNations. Member States should establish conditions \r\nthat would bring the United Nations into the twenty-\r\nfirst century, thus guaranteeing peace and providing a \r\nforum in which to promote a dignified life for peoples \r\nalong the axis of freedom, which is the basis for \r\njustice. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Vladimir Norov, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan. \r\n Mr. Norov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAllow me, on behalf of the Republic of Uzbekistan, to \r\nwelcome the participants in the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session and wish this forum success in \r\nits work. \r\n I am not mistaken if I say that the world \r\ncommunity is looking forward to concrete results from \r\nthe realization of the development goals formulated in \r\nthe Millennium Declaration. A special role has been \r\nassigned to the United Nations in achieving the \r\nobjectives set by the Declaration, including elaborating \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 12 \r\n \r\nfair and acceptable approaches to the issues of the \r\naccess to, and use and distribution of, natural \r\nresources; maintaining environmental sustainability; \r\ncombating transnational threats; and establishing a \r\nfree, tolerant and stable developing world in the \r\ncontext of globalization. \r\n One of the most serious problems of the present \r\nday is the reasonable use of natural resources and, \r\nabove all, water and energy resources. Various and \r\nambiguous approaches in this sphere hamper the \r\nprocess of development and lead to conflict situations \r\nand sometimes to ecological catastrophes. The fate of \r\nthe Aral Sea may serve as an example. The receding of \r\nthe Sea has tragic consequences not only for the \r\npeoples of Central Asia but also for the larger \r\nsubregion and even all of Eurasia. \r\n It is necessary to underscore that the major point \r\nis the use of resources and watercourses of \r\ntransboundary rivers, which over the span of centuries \r\nhave met the vital needs of States and peoples living \r\nalong these rivers. The Republic of Uzbekistan \r\nbelieves that all decisions on the use of the \r\nwatercourses of transboundary rivers, including the \r\nconstruction of hydropower facilities, must in no way \r\ninflict ecological damage or infringe upon the interests \r\nof the population of countries in the neighbouring \r\nterritories. \r\n The Convention on the Environmental Impact \r\nAssessment in a Transboundary Context of February \r\n1991, the Convention on the Protection and Use of \r\nTransboundary Watercourses and International Lakes \r\nof March 1992, and the Convention on the Law of the \r\nNon-navigational Uses of International Watercourses \r\nof 1997 directly point to the reasonable use of \r\ntransboundary river resources. Those Conventions \r\nrequire that transboundary waters be used in a \r\nreasonable and equitable way, taking into particular \r\naccount their transboundary character, in the case of \r\nactivities that have or are likely to have a \r\ntransboundary impact. \r\n In the case of the infliction of damage, all \r\nmeasures must be taken to repair or mitigate such \r\ndamage, and, if necessary, the issue of compensation is \r\nto be considered. It is underscored in United Nations \r\nConventions that the watercourse States shall cooperate \r\non the basis of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, \r\nmutual benefit and good faith. According to those \r\nfundamental requirements of the Conventions, \r\nauthoritative international experts must give guarantees \r\nthat the construction of hydrotechnical facilities will \r\nnot have irremediable ecological consequences and \r\nwill not throw off the established balance of the use of \r\nwatercourses of transboundary rivers by all States \r\nlocated in the basin of those rivers. \r\n We are convinced that those requirements must \r\nbe fulfilled in the implementation of various projects \r\nbuilding hydropower facilities in Central Asia with the \r\nparticipation of both national and transnational \r\ncompanies, so as not to allow for a catastrophic \r\ndeterioration of the ecological situation in the region. \r\nWe would like to remind investor countries who have \r\nexpressed a wish to participate in the implementation \r\nof such projects of those conditions. \r\n The current situation in Central Asia \r\ndemonstrates the interlinking of many contradictory \r\nprocesses, which could negatively influence security \r\nnot only in our region, but also far beyond its limits. \r\nUzbekistan has consistently supported the effective \r\npost-war recovery of Afghanistan. We strongly believe \r\nthat stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan should be \r\naccomplished not through militarization, but through \r\ndemilitarization, the resolution of outstanding social \r\nand economic problems and support to the country’s \r\npopulation through the active participation and \r\nassistance of the world community. Certainly, the most \r\nimportant conditions for that are the reaching of a \r\nconsensus, the taking of coordinated measures by all \r\nparties interested in stabilizing and reviving \r\nAfghanistan and curbing the ever-present drug threat \r\nthat emanates from that country. \r\n The matter of shaping and promoting an ideology \r\nof tolerance, mutual understanding and cultural \r\ndiversity has taken on a special urgency in the context \r\nof maintaining peace and security at the regional and \r\nglobal levels. The Republic of Uzbekistan makes its \r\nown contribution to the support of the dialogue among \r\ncultures and civilizations, which must be maintained in \r\nthe framework of international law without strain or \r\npressure, without attempts to impose unacceptable \r\nvalues and moral norms and by preserving respect for \r\npeoples, thought processes which have been shaped \r\nover many centuries and millennia. The correctness of \r\nsuch an approach was particularly stressed during the \r\ninternational conference on Uzbekistan’s contribution \r\nto the development of Islamic civilization, held in \r\nUzbekistan in August 2007, and attended by prominent \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n13 07-52428 \r\n \r\nscholars, theologians and government and public \r\nfigures from different parts of the world. \r\n The designation by the Islamic Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization of Tashkent, the \r\ncapital of Uzbekistan, as a world capital of Islamic \r\nculture represented the recognition of the role and \r\nsignificance of Uzbekistan in Islamic civilization. \r\nUzbekistan has for centuries been a centre of \r\nenlightened Islam, which seeks to strengthen in the \r\nconsciousness of people such eternal values as the \r\naspiration towards kindness and peace, tolerance in \r\ninter-ethnic and inter-faith relations, and mutual \r\nrespect and accord among peoples, regardless of the \r\ncolour of their skin or their beliefs. That is why we are \r\nseriously concerned about some negative \r\ninterpretations of the historical role of Islam and the \r\ndeliberate distortion of historical facts. We resolutely \r\noppose the transformation of counterterrorism into \r\nIslamophobia and into an overt or covert stand-off with \r\nthe Islamic world. \r\n In such circumstances, the role of the United \r\nNations is more important than ever before in \r\nencouraging and promoting cultural diversity, tolerance \r\nand mutual understanding among religions. In that \r\ncontext, Uzbekistan welcomes the High-level Dialogue \r\non Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace to be held on 4 and 5 October. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to express the sincere hope \r\nthat the results of the work of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session will promote the successful \r\nrealization of the joint efforts of Member States to \r\naddress challenges and threats to global security, as \r\nwell as the further peaceful development of the world’s \r\nnations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the \r\nMaldives. \r\n Mr. Shahid (Maldives): Allow me at the outset to \r\nextend to Mr. Kerim my delegation’s warmest \r\ncongratulations on his election to preside over the \r\nsixty-second session of the General Assembly. His \r\nelection to that high office is a tribute to his wisdom \r\nand skill, as well as a true reflection of the important \r\nrole played by his country in the international arena. I \r\nassure him of my delegation’s full cooperation in his \r\nwork. \r\n At the same time, allow me to place on record my \r\ndelegation’s profound gratitude and appreciation to his \r\npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the \r\ncommendable manner in which she guided the work of \r\nthe sixty-first session. \r\n Let me also take this opportunity to express my \r\ndelegation’s deep appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his dedication and \r\nleadership. The Maldives pledges its full support for \r\nthe Secretary-General’s untiring work in promoting the \r\nnoble principles of this Organization. \r\n It is indeed a privilege for me to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on this historic day, when the \r\nUnited Nations is observing the International Day of \r\nNon-Violence. On this day, we pay special tribute to \r\nMahatma Gandhi, one of the greatest men of all times.  \r\n The Maldives has always been a country which \r\nhas promoted peace, non-violence, tolerance and \r\nhuman rights. However, the spectre of terrorism visited \r\nthe Maldives this past weekend. On Saturday \r\nafternoon, an improvised explosive device was \r\ndetonated in the commercial area of our capital, Malé, \r\ninjuring 12 innocent bystanders. That unprovoked \r\nattack was the first of its kind in our history. I would \r\nlike to extend our sincere sympathies to those who \r\nwere injured and to their families.  \r\n The Maldives is a country renowned for its \r\ntranquillity and warm welcomes. Our people are united \r\nin shock and outrage that this happened on our soil. \r\nThat shock is matched by a determination that such \r\ncowardly acts of aggression will not be allowed to \r\nundermine or jeopardize the maintenance of our \r\npeaceful and harmonious society. On behalf of the \r\npeople of the Maldives, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank our many friends in the \r\ninternational community for their expressions of \r\nsupport and solidarity. I would particularly like to \r\nthank those countries that have provided us with their \r\nexpertise, technical advice and assistance in the \r\nongoing investigations. Finally, I would like to \r\ncommend the work of our domestic law enforcement \r\nand other agencies that have reacted to the incident \r\nwith such speed and professionalism. The incident \r\nserves as a reminder that no State is immune from the \r\nscourge of terrorism. The Maldives utterly condemns \r\nall acts of terrorism, wherever they are perpetrated. \r\n The Maldives, as a low-lying small island State, \r\nis particularly vulnerable to the perils of global climate \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 14 \r\n \r\nchange, a point brought sharply into focus by the \r\nrecent sea swells that submerged a large part of the \r\ncountry. For the past 20 years, the Maldives, along \r\nwith its partners in the Alliance of Small Island States, \r\nhas thus been at the forefront of efforts to bring the \r\nissue of climate change and its devastating impact on \r\nsmall island developing States to the world’s attention. \r\n Addressing this Assembly in 1987 at the high-\r\nlevel debate on environment and development, the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives, Mr. Maumoon \r\nAbdul Gayoom, said: \r\n “The profound dilemma of environmental \r\ntransition is a global one, and its implications are \r\nworldwide and long-term. Though the Maldives \r\nand other low-lying archipelagic nations may \r\nhave to suffer the most immediate and the most \r\nextreme effects of a global sea-level rise, there is \r\na potential danger to a significant portion of the \r\nworld’s population in the near future … No one \r\nnation, or even a group of nations, can alone \r\ncombat the onset of a global change in \r\nenvironment.” \r\n Since that ground-breaking debate, the \r\ninternational community has convened numerous \r\nconferences and summits at which it has agreed on a \r\nwide range of plans and programmes of action aimed at \r\naddressing global climate change. However, as a \r\ncommunity of nations we must regretfully concede \r\nthat, all too often, the reality of implementation has \r\nfailed to match the ambitions of rhetoric. \r\n Twenty years on, greenhouse gas emission levels \r\nare continuing to increase unabated and the \r\nconsequences of global warming are becoming ever \r\nmore  apparent. One can only therefore conclude that \r\nthe past 20 years have been an era of missed \r\nopportunities. \r\n Despite those stark facts, last week’s high-level \r\ndebate on climate change has once again given us some \r\nhope and encouragement. As a result of a palpable \r\nchange in world opinion, there is now a real sense of \r\ninternational momentum leading towards December’s \r\ncrucial Conference in Bali. We believe that the \r\nConference offers us a chance to overcome the failed \r\npromises and missed opportunities of the past, and to \r\nbuild a new global consensus on climate change. \r\n We must take collective responsibility and agree \r\nto an integrated and comprehensive approach to \r\nclimate change that recognizes and covers all four \r\npillars of climate change policy — mitigation, \r\nadaptation, technology transfer and funding. While the \r\nnecessary steps are clear, the crucial question, as \r\nalways, is whether the international community has the \r\npolitical will to undertake those steps; to build on the \r\ncommitments entered into in Rio, Kyoto, \r\nJohannesburg, New York and elsewhere; and to secure \r\na successful outcome from the Bali process. \r\n I can assure the Assembly that the Maldives will \r\nplay its part in this process. I am happy to announce \r\nhere today my Government’s intention to host a \r\npreparatory meeting for the Alliance of Small Island \r\nStates in the Maldives in November. The purpose of \r\nthis meeting is to draft a collective stand on the \r\nindividual human dimension of climate change for \r\nsubmission to the Bali Conference.  \r\n The Asian tsunami of 2004 represented the worst \r\nnatural disaster in the history of the Maldives. The \r\neconomic damage and losses alone were equivalent to \r\nalmost two thirds of the country’s gross domestic \r\nproduct. Although much remains to be done to \r\ncomplete the process of recovery, a considerable \r\namount has already been achieved. We need the \r\ncontinued support of our development partners and the \r\ninternational community to overcome the challenge of \r\ntsunami recovery. \r\n The devastating tsunami threatened to derail the \r\nMaldives in its attempts to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and our planned \r\ngraduation from the list of least developed countries \r\n(LDCs). \r\n Despite the tsunami, the Maldives continues to \r\nmake strong progress towards the attainment of the \r\nMDGs. The Maldives has already achieved Goal 1, the \r\neradication of extreme poverty and hunger, and Goal 2, \r\nthe achievement of universal primary education. We \r\nare also on course to meet Goals 4, 5 and 6 on reducing \r\nchild mortality, improving maternal health, and \r\ncombating communicable diseases, respectively. \r\nConsolidating and strengthening progress towards all \r\nthe MDGs is a key focus of the recently launched \r\nseventh national development plan. \r\n Buoyed by these successes, the Maldives will \r\nnext year begin its transition period for graduation \r\nfrom LDC status. For the Maldives, graduation \r\nrepresents a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is \r\nrecognition of the startling economic and social \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n15 07-52428 \r\n \r\ndevelopment that the country has enjoyed over the past \r\n30 years. On the other hand, graduation will bring with \r\nit a range of new challenges. For example, we will \r\nenjoy less favourable trading conditions and reduced \r\nlevels of development assistance. Adapting to this new \r\nreality will not be easy. In that regard, I would like to \r\nuse my speech today to once again urge our \r\ninternational partners to assist us in making the \r\ntransition as smooth as possible. \r\n Next year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. The Maldives Government is determined to \r\nmark the occasion by completing the country’s current \r\nreform agenda, an ambitious programme of reforms \r\ndesigned to strengthen individual rights and freedoms, \r\nahead of multiparty elections under a new Constitution. \r\n Since the start of the reform agenda in 2004, the \r\nMaldives has made remarkable strides in the field of \r\nhuman rights. An independent Paris Principles-\r\ncompliant Human Rights Commission has been \r\nestablished. The Maldives has acceded to the two \r\nmajor human rights covenants — on civil and political \r\nrights, and on economic, social and cultural rights. \r\nLater today I will sign, on behalf of the Government, \r\nthe International Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities, meaning that the Maldives will have \r\nsigned or ratified eight of the nine core human rights \r\ntreaties. Last year, the Maldives also became the first \r\ncountry in Asia to ratify the Optional Protocol to the \r\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \r\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment. \r\n However, the Government readily concedes that \r\nmuch more needs to be done. Therefore, the \r\nGovernment is proceeding in its work in close \r\ncooperation with international human rights bodies. \r\nFor example, last year, the Maldives became one of the \r\nfew countries to extend a standing invitation to visit \r\nthe country to all United Nations human rights special \r\nrapporteurs. In addition, earlier this year, the \r\nGovernment invited the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to appoint a national \r\nhuman rights adviser to the Maldives. \r\n The Maldives reiterates its support for the right of \r\nthe Palestinian people to an independent homeland. We \r\ntherefore call on the international community, led by \r\nthe Quartet, to revive the peace process as a matter of \r\nurgency.  \r\n The Maldives also calls on the international \r\ncommunity to continue and intensify its efforts to bring \r\npeace and stability to Iraq and Afghanistan. \r\n The Maldives also reiterates its steadfast \r\nopposition to the development, proliferation or use of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\n Strengthening and revitalizing the United Nations \r\nto take on the new and emerging challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century remains an important task. We are \r\nencouraged by the progress that has been made in \r\nimplementing the wide-ranging United Nations reform \r\nprogramme over the past two years. We sincerely \r\nbelieve, however, that these reforms cannot fully \r\nsucceed without the much-needed and concurrent \r\nreform of the Security Council. Maldives firmly \r\nbelieves that an effective multilateral framework is \r\nfundamental for the security of small States and that \r\nsuch a framework should take into consideration \r\nmodern geopolitical realities. \r\n In this regard, the Maldives reiterates its support \r\nfor the Group of Four (G-4) draft resolution on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We hope, therefore, that we \r\nwill be able to make progress on Security Council \r\nreform during this session. \r\n Before I conclude, please allow me to reaffirm \r\nour commitment to the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and to offer our full \r\nsupport to its continuing work for the betterment of \r\nhumanity and for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to Mr. Sonatane Tu’a Taumoepeau-\r\nTupou, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga. \r\n Mr. Taumoepeau-Tupou (Tonga): At the outset, \r\nI offer my congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. Let \r\nme assure him of the Kingdom of Tonga’s cooperation, \r\nand of every confidence that the sixty-second session \r\nof the General Assembly will be productive and \r\nsuccessful under his very able leadership. I also wish to \r\ncommend Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain for her \r\ndedication in guiding the work of the sixty-first session \r\nof the General Assembly. I also take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the new Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 16 \r\n \r\nKi-moon, and to assure him of Tonga’s support during \r\nhis tenure in office. \r\n As the United Nations advances well into its \r\nsixty-second year, we can ask ourselves how we have \r\nfared in the stewardship of our world. Have we passed \r\nthe test or have we been found wanting? The plethora \r\nof outstanding issues, unfulfilled commitments, and \r\nnew and evolving global challenges reaffirms the \r\nrelevance of the United Nations as the only multilateral \r\ninstitution that can appropriately deal with these \r\ncomplex global issues. \r\n The year 2007 marks the halfway point towards \r\nthe target date for accomplishment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which were endorsed by \r\nworld leaders as a road map to a better world by the \r\nyear 2015. As the President rightly observed, \r\n“[a]chieving the MDGs is not solely a test of our \r\nability to deliver on our promises; it is, above all, a test \r\nof our moral obligations and the values that are \r\nenshrined in the Charter” (A/62/PV.1). \r\n The process of an annual ministerial review of \r\nprogress made in the implementation of development \r\ngoals and targets, which commenced this year, \r\nprovides us with a tool to gauge progress at the \r\nnational level and bring into focus outstanding issues \r\nto be addressed, as well as highlighting positive \r\nexperiences and best practices that can be replicated by \r\nMember States. In addition, the President’s proposal to \r\nhold a MDG leaders meeting during the sixty-second \r\nsession is very welcome. \r\n Any meaningful discussion of the MDG cannot \r\nbe had without also referring to financing for \r\ndevelopment. Since the landmark agreement endorsed \r\nin Monterrey in 1992, the scorecard has been mixed. \r\nWhile considerable advances have been made in some \r\nareas, stagnation or retrogression has been experienced \r\nin others. One such area is in the fulfilment of \r\ncommitments by developed countries to achieve the \r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) \r\nfor overseas development assistance by 2015. Tonga \r\njoins others in calling on donor countries that have not \r\nfulfilled their obligations to recommit themselves to \r\nmeeting the targets by 2015. We also look forward to a \r\npositive outcome in the forthcoming High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development to be held \r\nlater this month as a lead-up to the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference in Doha, Qatar, in 2008. \r\n Tonga has emphasized in other forums that, in \r\norder to achieve the MDGs, it is also imperative that \r\naffordable, clean and efficient energy be available to \r\nall through improved access to reliable and affordable \r\nenergy services. Technical and financial support, \r\nhowever, is required to ensure that the poor derive \r\ntangible benefits from public investment in the energy \r\nsector. \r\n The central theme selected for the general debate, \r\nresponding to climate change, is of particular relevance \r\nto small island developing countries, including Tonga. \r\nClimate change is not regarded as just an \r\nenvironmental issue, since it has implications for \r\neconomic growth, sustainable development and the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. Tonga commends the \r\nSecretary-General for his laudable initiative to hold the \r\nrecent high-level dialogue, which infused political \r\nmomentum and set the stage for the Bali Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, to be held in \r\nDecember 2007. Tonga supports the view that \r\nnegotiations must be advanced towards a global and \r\ncomprehensive agreement on a post-2010 framework to \r\nlimit global emissions to avoid dangerous climate \r\nchange. It is important, therefore, that this process be \r\ncompleted by 2009. \r\n Tonga further supports the position that the \r\nessential parameters of such a global framework should \r\ninclude the following items: enhanced leadership by \r\nthe industrialized countries on emission reductions; \r\nincentives for developing countries to act, but without \r\nsacrificing economic growth or poverty reduction, and \r\nin a manner fully consistent with the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities; \r\nsignificantly increased support for adaptation in \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed \r\ncountries and small island developing States; and \r\nstrengthened technology development and \r\ndissemination, with new approaches to financing, \r\nincluding better use of market-based approaches. \r\n The threat of terrorism continues to be real, and it \r\nis a complex global issue. Following the adoption of \r\nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\n(resolution 60/288) in September 2006, success will be \r\nguaranteed only if the Strategy is fully implemented. \r\nTonga looks forward to positive progress leading to the \r\nfinalization of a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism during the sixty-second session \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n17 07-52428 \r\n \r\n As regards peacekeeping operations, we are all \r\nwitnessing a surge in the demand for peace operations, \r\nwith over 100,000 personnel currently serving in the \r\nfield. It is also projected that there will be a further \r\nincrease in numbers as new and expanded missions are \r\napproved. This development will certainly provide a \r\nmajor operational challenge to the institution. Tonga \r\nremains committed to supporting international \r\npeacekeeping efforts where we are requested to provide \r\nsuch assistance and in keeping with the policy of my \r\nGovernment. We commend the contributions of United \r\nNations peacekeepers in fulfilling the role of helping \r\nparties to end hostilities. \r\n Tonga supports the ongoing work on the reform \r\nagenda of the United Nations and commends the \r\ncommitment by the Secretary-General to breathe new \r\nlife and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened \r\nUnited Nations firmly anchored in the twenty-first \r\ncentury, and effective, efficient, coherent and \r\naccountable. On the outstanding issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform, we need to remind ourselves of our \r\ncommitment in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1) to early reform of the Council. Tonga \r\nlooks forward to the forthcoming intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and anticipates that the process will \r\nprovide the necessary impetus for decisive action to \r\nbring closure to the issue. \r\n On the question of Taiwan, Tonga is of the view \r\nthat maintaining the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Member States and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of Member States are among the \r\ncardinal principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Thus, Tonga continues to adhere to the \r\none-China policy, recognizing Taiwan as an integral \r\npart of China. \r\n Regional integration and cooperation are vital for \r\nsmall island developing countries of the Pacific in view \r\nof their remoteness, small size and narrow economic \r\nbase. The Pacific Plan is currently in its second year of \r\nimplementation; it focuses on four overlapping pillars, \r\nincluding economic growth, sustainable development, \r\ngood governance and security. In this regard, Tonga \r\ncommends the Secretary-General for attaching \r\nimportance to strengthening United Nations \r\ncooperation with our regional organizations. Tonga \r\ncontinues to support the process of regional \r\ncooperation and looks forward to hosting the thirty-\r\neighth annual Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in \r\nNuku’alofa later this month. \r\n After 10 years of negotiations, the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) welcomed Tonga on 27 July 2007 \r\nas the 151st member of the organization. As a small \r\nisland developing nation, there are many challenges \r\nand obstacles to gaining full benefit from the global \r\ntrading system, including productive capacity and \r\ninfrastructure. It is, therefore, imperative that the Doha \r\ndevelopment Round negotiations be concluded \r\nexpeditiously, with a meaningful development package, \r\nincluding the elimination of all export subsidies, \r\nimproved market access and enhanced special and \r\ndifferentiated treatment. Last year, we urged the donor \r\ncommunity to move forward with the delivery of “aid \r\nfor trade” independent of the Doha Round. In this \r\nregard, we wish to commend our donor partners for the \r\neffort to improve the delivery of aid for trade in Asia \r\nand the Pacific to ensure that countries take full \r\nadvantage of the open global market in the lead-up to \r\nthe WTO global aid for trade review that will be held \r\nlater this year. \r\n Tonga continues to advocate for labour mobility \r\nas a vehicle for achieving its pro-poor strategies. \r\nEarlier this year, the New Zealand Government \r\ninstituted a seasonal labour programme for agricultural \r\nworkers from five kick-start countries in the Pacific, \r\nincluding Tonga. We view this as an important and \r\npositive step towards wider acceptance of this type of \r\nmodel by developed countries as an option for \r\nresolving seasonal labour shortages. \r\n Our Legislative Assembly this year passed a law \r\nthat allows dual citizenship. The new law gives due \r\nrecognition to the large number of Tongans residing \r\noverseas, their significant contribution to the economy \r\nand their desire to still have links to their homeland. \r\n Last year at this rostrum, we provided a brief \r\nsynopsis of the state of play in the process leading to \r\nthe greater democratization of Tonga’s political system. \r\nRegrettably, while the report of the National \r\nCommittee on Political Reform was being deliberated \r\nby the Legislative Assembly, the supporters of one of \r\nthe three models of reform rioted, burned and \r\ndestroyed 80 per cent of the central business district, \r\nwhich resulted in the loss of eight lives. In a matter of \r\na few hours, the tally of the damage incurred equated \r\nto a loss of 20 per cent of the gross domestic product. \r\nA state of emergency was subsequently declared by the \r\nGovernment, initially for a one-month period, but has \r\nby necessity and by demand been continuously \r\nextended to prevent any further civil disturbance. \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 18 \r\n \r\n In our hour of need, Tonga sought the support of \r\nits neighbours New Zealand and Australia to assist \r\nlocal police in establishing order. They responded \r\npromptly and appropriately with the deployment of \r\nmilitary and police personnel. Within a period of two \r\nweeks, the role played by our friendly neighbours, as \r\nwell as by the Tonga Defence Services and the Tonga \r\nPolice Force, provided security and law and order for \r\nthe country. \r\n A reconstruction committee under my \r\nchairmanship is coordinating the reconstruction of \r\nNuku’alofa Township. Government, however, is fully \r\ncommitted to bringing all of the perpetrators of that \r\nhorrendous event to full accountability for their \r\nactions, and the court cases are ongoing. At the same \r\ntime, efforts are in progress on a process of national \r\nreconciliation. \r\n A tripartite select committee of the Legislative \r\nAssembly was also established to review the political \r\nreform agenda. The report of the tripartite committee \r\nwas recently tabled to the Legislative Assembly, where \r\na timetable was approved for the full implementation \r\nof political reform by 2010. \r\n We seek the understanding and support of the \r\ninternational community as we continue with the \r\nhealing of the wounds through the national \r\nreconciliation process, the rebuilding of the central \r\nbusiness district, as well as the transition into a more \r\ndemocratic political system that is relevant to the \r\neconomic, social and cultural architecture of the \r\nnation. \r\n It has been emphasized time and again that what \r\nis needed in the United Nations is to close the gap \r\nbetween rhetoric and actions. There has been much \r\nrhetoric and commitment, but the world will not judge \r\nus on rhetoric. The world will judge us on our outputs \r\nand on what we deliver. Let us face up to our \r\nresponsibility, fulfil our promises so as to equate \r\nrhetoric with action, and show the people whose lives \r\nwill be impacted by the decisions we make in this Hall \r\nthat we can be trusted to deal effectively with global \r\nissues that require global solutions. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency The Honourable \r\nTimothy Harris, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis. \r\n Mr. Harris (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I have the \r\nhonour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session on behalf of the Government and \r\npeople of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. \r\n I extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kerim \r\nand his country, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, on his assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure \r\nhim of my delegation’s full cooperation as he \r\nendeavours to chart the course of positive interaction \r\nand coordination in this international arena. \r\n I would also like to welcome the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who is assisting at his first \r\ngeneral debate of the General Assembly as Secretary-\r\nGeneral. My delegation supports him in his all-too-\r\nimportant task of managing the affairs of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Small island developing States such as Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis rely on the United Nations to level the \r\nplaying field in international discourse so that we can \r\ninteract, contribute and benefit on an equal footing \r\nwith other members of the international community. \r\n Twenty-four years ago, Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\ntook the bold step of joining this body. We pledged \r\nthen to do all in our power to pursue peace, security, \r\nhuman rights and development. Twenty-four years \r\nlater, my beautiful country can boast that it has kept \r\nfaith with our people and the international community. \r\nIt has achieved much, and the pace and nature of its \r\ndevelopment set an example for other small island \r\ndeveloping States. \r\n Today, the human development index of the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme ranks us \r\nfifty-first out of 177 countries evaluated in the world. \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has indices on per capita gross \r\ndomestic product, health and educational enrolment \r\ncomparable to those of many in the developed world. \r\nPleased as we are with our progress, we are all too \r\naware that the journey is not yet ended. Much work \r\nneeds to be done. Poverty in our Federation and in the \r\nCaribbean is still at an unacceptable level, and the \r\nturbulence of the global climate vitiates our continuing \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are almost at the mid-point of the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). If we were to evaluate ourselves as a whole, \r\nwe would have to acknowledge that many of the \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n19 07-52428 \r\n \r\ncommitments have not been met. Aid has fallen off, \r\nofficial development assistance has been limited, and \r\nwe have seen competing initiatives divert the drive of \r\nfulfilling the MDGs. Today, Saint Kitts and Nevis calls \r\nupon all States, be they in the North, South, East or \r\nWest, developed or developing, to do all in their power \r\nto ensure the realization of the fruits of our united \r\nvision that proposed the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n United Nations Member States are not all equal in \r\nendowments. Those that have more resources must \r\nallocate more to the global development agenda. The \r\ndeveloped world must meet its financing commitments, \r\nas agreed at the Monterrey International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development. That Conference \r\nrepresents a landmark because, for the first time, the \r\ndeveloped world agreed that we were jointly \r\nresponsible for development and that it had a special \r\nrole in financing for development. That commitment, \r\nregrettably, has not been matched by real resources. \r\n The United Nations will hold a follow-up to the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. The State of Qatar has generously \r\noffered to host that meeting. We applaud that country \r\nfor its commitment to the cause and we again call upon \r\nall countries to implement the commitments they made \r\nat Monterrey.  \r\n Saint Kitts and Nevis acknowledges that the \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic constitutes a threat to our \r\ndevelopment and, indeed, our security. Prime Minister \r\nDenzil Douglas, in his capacity as Caribbean lead \r\nspokesman for health and human and social \r\ndevelopment has often stated that this matter requires \r\nserious and dedicated monitoring and action.  \r\n The fight to eradicate the scourge of HIV/AIDS \r\nmust continue, and we must dedicate ourselves to that \r\ntask. No matter the merits and demerits of the debate \r\nconcerning issues in relation to intellectual property \r\nrights, the evidence has shown that only with cheaper \r\nantiretroviral drugs can the HIV/AIDS pandemic at the \r\nminimum be managed and its threat to humankind \r\nreduced. Therefore, there is a need to address the issues \r\nrelated to the cost of these drugs so that they can be \r\navailable to all who need them. \r\n The book of Genesis reminds us that man was \r\nmade to coexist peacefully with his environment. The \r\nplanet Earth is not an inheritance; rather, it is a loan \r\nfrom our children and grandchildren, who hope that \r\none day we will return to them a clean and wholesome \r\nEarth. We must be careful, then, that our production \r\nand consumption patterns and behaviours do not \r\nsurpass the environment’s capacity to sustain them. \r\n The matter of climate change is of continuing and \r\ngreat interest to my Government. Indeed, we view the \r\nassociated problems of the high frequency of abnormal \r\nweather, sea level rise, global warming and coastal \r\ndegradation as matters affecting the economic and \r\nenvironmental security of small States such as Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis. We are indeed heartened by the \r\npriority being accorded to this matter by the new \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n This year, Saint Kitts and Nevis signed the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, which signalled my country’s commitment to \r\ndoing all that it can to reduce its carbon emissions. We \r\nurge other States to sign the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nKyoto Protocol. \r\n Indeed, Saint Kitts and Nevis will never shirk its \r\nresponsibilities as a global citizen. We believe that \r\nglobal environmental management and multinational \r\nefforts could resolve many issues — particularly at this \r\ntime, when all of us have experienced environmental \r\ndeterioration. We call on developed countries to \r\nprovide greater support to small island developing \r\nStates in combating the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange. In addition, we urge far greater South-South \r\ncooperation on the important matter of climate change. \r\n We live at a time when disasters are occurring \r\nwith a rapidity not previously felt. Within CARICOM, \r\nwe felt the impact of the passage of Hurricane Dean, \r\nduring which lives were lost, livelihoods were \r\nthreatened and, in the case of Jamaica, an election was \r\npostponed. That same hurricane moved on to wreak \r\nhavoc in Mexico and was followed very closely by \r\nother, equally destructive hurricanes. \r\n Over the past year, nearly every region of the \r\nworld has endured some form of natural or man-made \r\ndisaster. My delegation believes, therefore, that we \r\nneed an increase in humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance. No country escapes the need for such \r\nassistance. In addition to supporting the existence and \r\nthe role of the Central Emergency Response Fund, we \r\nencourage Member States to commit to that and similar \r\ninitiatives. \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 20 \r\n \r\n I now turn to United Nations reform. During the \r\ncourse of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, the issue of reform of the United Nations \r\nand, in particular, system-wide coherence received \r\nextensive attention. Saint Kitts and Nevis believes that \r\nreform is necessary. My delegation’s position, \r\ntherefore, is that the time has come for agreement on \r\nthe issue and on the way forward. We need continued \r\ndialogue, of course. But, most important, Member \r\nStates need to agree on a plan of action and its \r\nimplementation, as well as on the need to get on with \r\nthe job. If we do not agree, or if we remain inflexible \r\nregarding one another’s concerns, we will all be at a \r\ndisadvantage. Therefore, the dialogue among \r\ncivilizations must continue, and implementation must \r\noccur, if true reform of all aspects of the United \r\nNations is to come to fruition. \r\n The United Nations must remain open to \r\nmembership for all States. In that regard, experience \r\nhas shown that United Nations membership is not a \r\ndeterrent to unification; consider, for example, the \r\nformer East Germany and West Germany. Nor is it a \r\npanacea for fragmentation, as some have argued, citing \r\nthe deconstruction of the former Soviet Union. What \r\nhas always been clear is that the United Nations has \r\nextended a warm welcome to all States and respected \r\nthe equality of all States. \r\n In the context of the principle of universality, my \r\ncountry renews its call for Taiwan to become a \r\nMember of the United Nations. It is of grave concern \r\nthat the 23 million people of Taiwan have been denied \r\nthe right to participate in the United Nations and its \r\nrelated bodies. During the sixty-first session, that \r\nexclusion and isolation were pursued even more \r\naggressively.  \r\n We, the friends of Taiwan, implore the United \r\nNations family to recognize that the people of Taiwan \r\nare a disenfranchised people. Many of us were once \r\nalso disenfranchised and unrepresented; but, through \r\ninternational recognition of our inalienable right to \r\nparticipate, we are here today. My delegation wishes to \r\nsee the same right enjoyed by the people of Taiwan. \r\n Taiwan has shown that it can be a true partner in \r\ndevelopment. In our view, the international community \r\nhas been deprived of the gift of that partnership at a \r\ntime when Taiwan’s assistance could have been so \r\nuseful to many States in meeting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n In March of this year, the United Nations \r\nobserved the bicentenary of the abolition of the trans-\r\nAtlantic slave trade. My Prime Minister, the \r\nHonourable Mr. Denzil Douglas, had the distinct \r\nhonour of addressing this body on behalf of \r\nCARICOM. One of the significant results of the \r\ncommemoration exercise has been an \r\nacknowledgement that the injustice of slavery still \r\nexists in one form or another and that there is a need to \r\naddress that problem. Child slavery and economic \r\nslavery impact the societies of the international \r\ncommunity, and we need to mobilize our collective \r\nresources to combat those scourges. Only when that \r\nhas been accomplished will we be able to feel that the \r\nbattle waged more than 200 years ago to abolish the \r\ntrans-Atlantic slave trade and all elements associated \r\nwith it has been won. \r\n Finally, as we look ahead to the rest of the sixty-\r\nsecond session, I wish to reiterate my country’s pledge \r\nof cooperation, commitment and dialogue to address \r\nthe many challenges that we will encounter in ensuring \r\nthat the United Nations remains the relevant forum for \r\ninternational relations. The United Nations must \r\ncontinue to be a beacon of hope for countries in search \r\nof peace, self-determination, respect for human rights, \r\nprogress, development and, very important, justice. It \r\nis not too late for this body to go and enchant the \r\nworld. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Djibril Yipènè Bassolet, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso. \r\n Mr. Bassolet (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like at the outset to express our sincere \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim on \r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-second session. I am convinced that, thanks \r\nto his skill as an experienced diplomat, he will ably \r\ncarry out his mandate. He can count on the cooperation \r\nof the delegation of Burkina Faso. I should also like to \r\nexpress our deep gratitude to his predecessor, Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the \r\nability with which she led the work of the sixty-first \r\nsession.  \r\n I would like, finally, to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, who has shown, in \r\nthe less than a year that he has been at the head of this \r\nOrganization, his full-fledged commitment to peace \r\nand development and his firm determination to pursue \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n21 07-52428 \r\n \r\nthe ambitious work of modernizing the United Nations \r\nbequeathed to him by his predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan. \r\n As I speak to this Assembly, Burkina Faso has \r\nhad floods this year, which have bereaved many \r\nfamilies in all regions of the country. The dozens of \r\ndeath, the thousands of homeless people and displaced \r\npersons, the food crisis and the subsequent epidemics \r\nhave implications above and beyond the statistics — \r\nthe heavy price that a country, such as Burkina Faso, \r\npays for global warming and all other phenomenon \r\nlinked to climate change. It is my hope that the \r\nconclusions of the important summit on climate change \r\nheld here on 24 September will promote the adoption \r\nof appropriate and urgent measures that will shield our \r\npopulations from this type of scourge. \r\n All types of tension are shaking the world and, in \r\nparticular, the African continent, which gives us \r\nreasons to welcome the role played by our \r\nOrganization in the search for and strengthening of \r\npeace and peacebuilding. Burkina Faso, which is the \r\nChair of the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS), is mindful that no sustainable \r\ndevelopment can be contemplated without an \r\nenvironment of peace and stability and has made \r\nconflict resolution a key thrust of its diplomacy. \r\n Therefore, President Compaoré has made a \r\nresolute commitment as facilitator to search for \r\nsolutions to the crises that have affected the fraternal \r\nand neighbouring countries of Togo and Côte d’Ivoire. \r\nThe Inter-Togolese Dialogue, which led in August 2006 \r\nto the signing in Lomé of a comprehensive political \r\nagreement. The agreement is bearing fruit, which \r\npleases all those concerned. The latest session of the \r\nfollow-up committee, which was held in Ouagadougou \r\nin August 2007, noted the conclusion of the electoral \r\nroll revision process and the setting of a date for \r\nlegislative elections on 14 October 2007. \r\n Prospects are encouraging in Togo and, on behalf \r\nof President Compaoré, facilitator of the Inter-Togolese \r\nDialogue, I can confirm the sincere will and the real \r\ncommitment of the people and the political class of \r\nTogo to get their country out of this crisis and to create \r\nthe best conditions conducive to reconstruction, growth \r\nand development. And, in thanking the international \r\ncommunity for their assistance, I would call on them to \r\npursue their action for institutional reforms, \r\npeacebuilding and economic development in Togo. \r\n In the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, thanks to the \r\nOuagadougou Political Accord, signed on 4 March \r\n2007 by President Gbagbo and the Secretary-General \r\nof the Forces Nouvelles Guillaume Soro, the end of \r\nhostilities is now a reality. And so we should commend \r\nand encourage them to persevere to a final peace in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire. The facilitator of the direct dialogue in \r\nthe Ivorian crisis, President Compaoré, who is \r\nPresident of the Conference of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of ECOWAS at this time, is please to see \r\nall of the political class and the entire population of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire joining in the Ouagadougou Accord. This \r\nAccord translates the will of the parties to proceed with \r\nidentifying people for an electoral enumeration and to \r\norganize a free, open and transparent presidential \r\nelection. The Security Council, in its resolution 1765 \r\n(2007), has endorsed this Accord. \r\n I would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nUnited Nations, which has supported Burkina Faso in \r\nits efforts to establish peace and security, particularly \r\nin West Africa. In deciding to be a candidate for a non-\r\npermanent seat on the Security Council, for the period \r\nof 2008-2009, Burkina Faso hopes to make its \r\ncontribution to the triumph of a world of justice and \r\npeace over the current world, where exclusion, \r\nintolerance and frustrations generate violent acts of \r\ndespair. At this time, I would like to reiterate our \r\nthanks to the member States of the ECOWAS and the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) who decided to make the \r\ncandidacy of Burkina Faso an African candidacy. Our \r\nhope is that all Members of this Organization will give \r\nus their trust. We will be worthy of it. \r\n Burkina Faso remains concerned by situations of \r\ntension and conflict in Africa and throughout the \r\nworld. We welcome the decision of the Security \r\nCouncil to deploy a hybrid United Nations-African \r\nUnion force in Darfur (UNAMIS). Burkina Faso has \r\ndecided to participate in it, as we have done in a \r\nnumber of other theatres of operation. I would call \r\nupon the international community to give peace a \r\nchance in the Sudan by giving this hybrid force the \r\nlogistical and financial resources necessary for \r\naccomplishing their mission. As for the protagonists, \r\nthey will have to do everything they can to make the \r\nupcoming talks an important milestone in the process \r\nof national reconciliation and in bringing peace to the \r\ncountry. \r\n We also think about the persistence of conflicts in \r\nSomalia and between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 22 \r\n \r\nSaharan zone, which includes the north of Mali and \r\nNiger, has also been hit by armed conflict. Burkina \r\nFaso has expressed its solidarity to those two \r\nneighbouring countries and hopes that durable \r\nsolutions will allow for peace to be re-established and \r\nwill allow for the promotion of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are pleased about the political developments \r\nin Sierra Leone, a country which has just had great \r\nsuccess in organizing free, democratic and transparent \r\ngeneral elections. This is the most recent illustration \r\nthat democracy and good governance are gradually \r\ntaking root in Africa. Throughout the continent, this \r\nprinciple of good governance is part of the political \r\nagendas. \r\n We also congratulate the Moroccan Government \r\nfor having initiated direct talks with the Polisario Front \r\non the future of the Western Sahara. By this direct \r\ndialogue the two parties are, together, proving their \r\nability to look for a mutually beneficial political \r\nsolution. We would strongly encourage them to do so, \r\nconvinced as we have always been that only a \r\nnegotiated, political solution will put an end to this \r\nconflict. \r\n Because it is at the heart of any lasting peace in \r\nthe region and throughout the world, the settlement of \r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict must remain an absolute \r\npriority for our Organization. In this respect, it has \r\nbeen established that the only solution is the creation \r\nof a Palestinian State that is viable with secure and \r\ninternationally recognized borders alongside a State of \r\nIsrael that is also certain of its security. And this is now \r\nwhere all efforts should be focused. \r\n In welcoming the existence of nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones, Burkina Faso is also calling for a \r\nresponsible, just and equitable approach to the so-\r\ncalled nuclear crises. My delegation is very much \r\nconcerned by the proliferation and the trafficking of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons, which for the victims \r\nare truly weapons of mass destruction. In West Africa, \r\nthe phenomenon is particularly disturbing and its \r\neradication requires sustained cooperation among \r\nStates, as well as significant support on the part of the \r\ninternational community. Burkina Faso, which is the \r\nChair of ECOWAS, has decided to make a priority of \r\nthis issue. \r\n The West African region is also in the process of \r\nbecoming a key centre of drug trafficking. That \r\nsituation requires urgent and appropriate action on our \r\npart, since it is likely to destabilize States, particularly \r\nby disrupting their economies and increasing the level \r\nof organized crime and corruption. Therefore, we call \r\nfor solidarity and support from the international \r\ncommunity to help us eradicate this scourge as swiftly \r\nas possible. \r\n Those worrisome issues will certainly be on the \r\nagenda of the conference on peace and security in West \r\nAfrica and the role of the joint European Union-Africa \r\nstrategy which my country will host in November \r\n2007. A joint initiative of the Republic of Austria and \r\nBurkina Faso, that important meeting will be an \r\nopportunity to identify the underlying causes of \r\nconflict and to formulate solutions capable of ensuring \r\nthe sustainable development of countries in the \r\nsubregion. \r\n The current situation in many countries reminds \r\nus of the cruel reality of terrorism, which remains \r\namong the most pernicious of challenges and thus the \r\nmost difficult to overcome. We must therefore \r\ndemonstrate greater solidarity to contain it. In \r\nparticular, we call for diligent implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and, \r\nin that connection, effective international cooperation \r\nto strengthen the current legal arsenal and the \r\nconclusion of a comprehensive convention as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n By working for sustainable peace, we offer our \r\nStates the best guarantee for their economic \r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, the current international \r\neconomic reality, which is characterized by \r\nglobalization and excessive liberalization, continues to \r\nbatter economies such as that of Burkina Faso. What is \r\nmore, these fragile economies must contend with unfair \r\ntrade rules. \r\n Several years ago, President Blaise Compaoré, by \r\nlaunching his crusade against subsidies for Northern \r\ncotton growers — a crusade that was also carried out \r\non behalf of his peers in Benin, Mali and Chad — \r\nsought to put an end to one of the most cynical \r\npractices of international trade. We hope to see the \r\nconclusion of the Doha Round of negotiations, which \r\nwill place development at the heart of international \r\ntrade. \r\n Millions of men, women and children — \r\nparticularly in Africa — are waiting to benefit from the \r\npositive impact of international trade in the hope that it \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n23 07-52428 \r\n \r\nwill contribute to their development and to the \r\nimprovement of their living conditions. For them, \r\npoverty and misery are not statistics or assessments, let \r\nalone projections. They are the mother who, because \r\nthere is no drinking water or no health facility within a \r\ndistance of 10 kilometres, sees the baby whom she bore \r\nwith difficulty die in her arms; they are the child who \r\nis eager for knowledge but who will never go to \r\nschool; they are the father who sees his only son \r\nconfront the wrath of the sea and jeopardize his life in \r\nsearch of a supposedly better life on some shore. Those \r\nare the daily tragedies to which all of us here can \r\nattest. \r\n We have the means to act. We must act quickly. \r\nWe must act now. \r\n For a number of years, we have engaged the \r\nUnited Nations in a process of qualitative change to \r\nequip it with the means to deal with the demands of the \r\nmodern world and to be able to effectively fulfil the \r\naspirations of peoples. However, while the \r\nachievements are considerable, the task remains vast \r\nand the expectations pressing. Thus, we must \r\ndemonstrate the will and the discernment to give the \r\nOrganization viable structures and adequate means. \r\nBurkina Faso hopes that, at the end of this process, the \r\nhistorical wrongs committed against Africa and other \r\nparts of the world will be corrected, particularly at the \r\nlevel of the Security Council. \r\n We also deplore the ongoing injustice committed \r\nagainst the Republic of China on Taiwan, whose \r\nlegitimate aspiration to participate fully in world \r\naffairs has been denied. Nevertheless, that country is a \r\ngood example of successful democracy and social and \r\neconomic development. By depriving 25 million men \r\nand women of the right to make their contribution to \r\nthe realization of United Nations principles and \r\nobjectives, our Organization is also depriving itself of \r\nits own quest for modernity and universality. \r\nTherefore, it is a new United Nations, open to all, that \r\nBurkina Faso earnestly calls for. \r\n Burkina Faso reaffirms its faith in multilateralism \r\nand in the role of the United Nations as an \r\nirreplaceable instrument for peace, development and \r\nthe promotion of dialogue among peoples, which it is \r\nour historic duty to preserve and strengthen. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency The Honourable Samuel \r\nInsanally, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guyana and \r\nformer President of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Insanally (Guyana): At the outset of my \r\nstatement, I wish to offer the President and our  \r\nnewly appointed Secretary-General my warmest \r\ncongratulations and best wishes for the success of the \r\nsixty-second session of the General Assembly, which \r\nhas as its main focus the impact of climate change on \r\nglobal peace and development. \r\n As the recently concluded High-level Event \r\nrevealed, there is now a greater awareness of that issue \r\nand of the need to address them with greater urgency. \r\nLike the legendary Rip Van Winkle, we appear to have \r\nfinally awakened from a long and deep slumber, only \r\nto find that the world around us is in serious danger of \r\ndegradation. Our environment has become frightening. \r\nAs a result of the increased consumption of fossil fuels \r\nin past decades, the amount of carbon dioxide in the \r\natmosphere has increased by more than 25 per cent, \r\nwhich will, if unmitigated, eventually lead to a rise in \r\nthe Earth’s temperature of more than 5 degrees in the \r\nyears ahead. Such warming is likely to produce an \r\nincrease in sea levels of almost 2 metres. Since one \r\nthird of the world’s population lives close to coastlines, \r\nsuch an elevation will have a disastrous impact on the \r\nliving conditions of many millions. At the same time, \r\nthe world’s forests are said to be vanishing at a rate of \r\n15 million hectares a year, threatening the loss of \r\nalmost 50 per cent of the forest cover in developing \r\ncountries. Altogether, those climatic changes will take \r\na heavy toll on the economic and social growth of \r\nmany countries, through a higher incidence of drought, \r\ndesertification, flooding and other natural disasters. \r\n The primary responsibility for this environmental \r\ndegradation has been laid — quite rightly — at the \r\ndoor of those developed countries whose \r\nindustrialization policies and programmes have shown \r\nscant regard for preservation of the global ecosystem. \r\nBy piggybacking on the natural assets of developing \r\ncountries, those States have achieved astonishing \r\neconomic and social progress and have created \r\nconsumerist societies whose appetites for ever-greater \r\nextravagance know no bounds and must be satisfied at \r\nall costs. \r\n In the face of mounting evidence that climate \r\nchange does in fact imperil the Earth and its resources, \r\nsome developed States appear willing to accept — \r\nalbeit reluctantly — that carbon emissions must be \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 24 \r\n \r\nsignificantly reduced to preserve the ozone layer as a \r\nshield from the effects of greenhouse gases. Even so, \r\nthey do not seem prepared to accept primary \r\nresponsibility for protecting the environment. Instead \r\nof “common but differentiated responsibility”, they \r\nspeak of “shared responsibility”, clearly demanding a \r\ngreater contribution by developing countries to the \r\ncampaign against climate change. This demand often \r\nbecomes a conditionality for any development \r\nassistance they offer. \r\n For the many developing countries which suffer \r\nfrom a chronic lack of resources, this imposition is \r\nclearly unequal and unfair. These States, including \r\nmany in sub-Saharan Africa, small islands in the \r\nCaribbean and the Pacific, and low-lying coastal States \r\nlike my own, are especially vulnerable to climatic \r\nchanges and, consequently, disaster prone. The \r\nBarbados Programme of Action and the subsequent \r\nMauritius Strategy were both devised for the purpose \r\nof alleviating the destructive impact of the many \r\nnatural disasters faced by these disadvantaged \r\ncountries. However, despite their initial promise, these \r\nagreements have yet to yield the measure of assistance \r\nneeded by small States to overcome the consequences \r\nof climate change. Invariably, these affected countries \r\nmust rely on their own limited resources to protect \r\ntheir environment from harm. \r\n Guyana fully understood and responded to the \r\nchallenges of climate change when, more than a decade \r\nago, it made available to the international community \r\nalmost one million acres of its pristine forest for the \r\nstudy of bio-diversity and the sustainable development \r\nof forestry. However, the future of this project is now \r\nthreatened, since financial support from the \r\ninternational community has become increasingly \r\nscarce. At the same time, as our President stated at the \r\nHigh-level Event, the Kyoto Protocol rewards — quite \r\nperversely, I might add — those States which burn and \r\npillage their resources but punishes others like Guyana \r\nwhich are committed to preserving their standing \r\nforests. This inequity should no longer be tolerated. \r\n It is very important that any post-Kyoto \r\nagreement be endowed with the resources necessary for \r\nits full implementation. Development assistance \r\nstatistics have shown a marked diminution in levels \r\nfrom past years, with little promise of the additional or \r\nnew financing needed for environment-related projects. \r\nThere, therefore, needs to be what has been called a \r\npartnership for additionality which, in return for a \r\ncommitment by countries to the preservation of the \r\nenvironment, will provide adequate and predictable \r\nfinancing to allow them to pursue a path of accelerated \r\nand sustainable development. It is high time to honour \r\nthe commitments made at the Monterrey International \r\nConference on Financing for Development. \r\n As a country which is below sea-level, Guyana \r\nhas been further sensitized to the threat of climate \r\nchange as a result of frequent floods that wreak \r\neconomic havoc on our coastal population. The last \r\nmajor inundation was in 2005, when the economic loss \r\nsuffered was, according to the estimate of the \r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, nearly 60 per cent of the country’s gross \r\ndomestic product. Unfortunately for us, the tragedy, \r\noccurring as it did around the same time as the tsunami \r\ndisaster, did not feature prominently on the \r\ninternational radar screen and, therefore, received little \r\nnotice in the wider community. However, thanks to the \r\nassistance of a few friendly countries and the resilience \r\nof our own people, we are on the road to recovery. That \r\nexperience, however, impels us to renew our call in \r\nthis Assembly for the strengthening of multilateral \r\nfacilities to provide all victims of such natural disasters \r\nwith prompt and adequate relief. \r\n As both the outcome of the High-level Event and \r\nthe statements heard so far in this Assembly make \r\nclear, the battle against climate change cannot be won \r\nunless a truly global effort is made to save the planet. \r\nIn the words of my country’s national poet, Martin \r\nCarter, in his poem entitled “All are involved”: \r\n “Like a jig \r\n shakes the loom; \r\n Like a web \r\n is spun the pattern; \r\n all are involved \r\n all are consumed” (All are involved) \r\n Therefore, unless all of us, both Governments and \r\npeoples, accept in a deep and meaningful way the \r\nimperative of prudent environmental management, our \r\ncivilization, such as we know it, will disappear. \r\n In this new era of globalization, humankind has \r\nbeen made acutely aware of the deep interdependence \r\nof nations and the concomitant need for cooperation \r\nwith one another to ensure our common survival. This \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n25 07-52428 \r\n \r\nawareness notwithstanding, many in the developed \r\nworld continue to practise their misguided “beggar-thy-\r\nneighbour” policy, which effectively precludes \r\ndeveloping countries from satisfying the aspirations of \r\ntheir people. \r\n Take, for example, the area of trade and economic \r\ncooperation, the main pillar on which globalization has \r\nbeen built. The developed countries continue to \r\npropagate the thesis that free trade will guarantee \r\nprosperity for all. The reality is that most countries, \r\nincluding my own, simply cannot compete successfully \r\nin fully liberalized markets unless they are assisted in \r\nmaking a gradual transition. Instead of assistance, \r\nhowever, some of the preferences that we enjoyed \r\nhitherto in some markets are being summarily \r\nwithdrawn. \r\n Witness the unilateral denunciation last week by \r\nthe European Union of the Sugar Protocol, a legally \r\nbinding instrument of indefinite duration, which \r\ngoverns the sugar exports of many African, Caribbean \r\nand Pacific countries to Europe. This step comes in the \r\nmidst of negotiations on this issue and is clearly a sign \r\nof bad faith. It has been taken without adequate \r\nconsultation and clarification and contradicts the \r\nEuropean Union’s own lectures to us on partnership \r\nand good governance. As a result of this action, \r\nthousands of our citizens, especially the rural poor, \r\nwhose lives depend upon the sugar industry, will likely \r\nface great hardship. It is, therefore, imperative that in \r\nthe negotiation of future trade arrangements, including \r\nthe Doha Round, due regard be paid to the \r\ndevelopment challenges of small States. \r\n Similarly, in the area of peace and security there \r\nis continuing blatant disregard of the rule of law by \r\nmany States that, in pursuit of their own selfish \r\nnational interests, do not hesitate to fan the flames of \r\nconflict in various parts of the world. As a \r\nconsequence, millions in Darfur, in Palestine, in the \r\nMiddle East and elsewhere are forced to endure \r\nunspeakable pain and suffering — pain and suffering \r\nwhich, in today’s world of instant communication, we \r\nnot only hear about but also actually see and feel in \r\nreal time. Our common humanity obliges us to call \r\nonce again for a return to the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations Charter, and in particular the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, wherever and \r\nwhenever they occur. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n In this context, I am pleased to announce that last \r\nmonth on 20 September an arbitral tribunal of great \r\neminence under the presidency of Judge Dolliver \r\nNelson, distinguished former President of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, sitting \r\npursuant to Annex VII of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, handed down a \r\ndecision regarding the maritime boundary between \r\nGuyana and neighbouring Suriname. The President of \r\nGuyana described the decision as just and erudite; the \r\nPresident of Suriname called it fair and equitable. It \r\nwas another feather in the crown of international law, \r\nanother blow struck against the resort to force and \r\nanother victory for lawful and peaceful processes in the \r\nsettlement of disputes.  \r\n Guyana had initiated recourse to the dispute \r\nsettlement provisions of the Convention, which, I am \r\nhappy to recall, was brought into force by our \r\ncountry’s ratification in 1993. Under the aegis of a \r\nUnited Nations regime created by internationalism and \r\nthe rule of international law, our two small countries \r\ncan now pursue the development of their maritime \r\nspace without the encumbrance of a dispute. It is an \r\nexample of the peaceful settlement of a dispute that \r\nothers might emulate.  \r\n In further demonstration of its commitment to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, my Government has \r\nplaced before the General Assembly an initiative \r\ncalling for a new global human order based on the \r\nprinciples of equity and social justice. It is born out of \r\nour conviction that, given the failure of our past \r\nefforts, the world now needs to formulate a \r\nqualitatively different and more holistic strategy, \r\nleading to a stronger political consensus and broad-\r\nbased partnership before the General Assembly. The \r\ndraft resolution now enjoys the sponsorship of forty-\r\nnine States and will in time, we hope, command the \r\nsupport of the entire international community. \r\n As this new era of globalization unfolds, with its \r\nmany challenges and opportunities, I invite this \r\nAssembly to support fully our appeal for the firm \r\nestablishment of a more enlightened and \r\ncompassionate model of multilateralism as the \r\ncornerstone of future international relations. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency Mr. \r\nBruno Stagno Ugarte, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nWorship of Costa Rica.  \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 26 \r\n \r\n Mr. Ugarte (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\n192 Member States gathered here have not yet taken \r\nthe qualitative leap called for by Woodrow Wilson in \r\n1918 for our international order not to be based on \r\norganized rivalries, but rather on an organized common \r\npeace.  \r\n We must learn to tone down our national \r\ninterests. We must foster a shared sense for what is just \r\nand what is necessary. We must understand that the \r\nbasic premise of collective security is that we must \r\nagree upon the threats that we face and the manner in \r\nwhich we must tackle them.  \r\n We must accept that collective security, in order \r\nto be legitimate, must defend international law in the \r\nabstract, without preference for some over others. \r\nNevertheless, we continue to have an unequal \r\ncommitment to international law. Some of us have \r\naccepted a multilateralism that is based on open \r\nagreements openly arrived at, whereas others refuse to \r\nyield imaginary shares of sovereignty. As long as the \r\nlatter continue to understand sovereignty as the \r\nabsence of obligations and responsibilities to others, \r\nmultilateralism is compromised.  \r\n Cultures and viewpoints from all parts of the \r\nworld gather here. They do so because they know that \r\nthe solitude of unilateralism is a dead-end road. \r\nMultilateralism must, however, have preconditions. \r\nThose who want to be treated as a partner must behave \r\nas one. If not, we will never be able to live up to our \r\npromise of “never again”. The “never again” that we \r\npronounced at the end of the First World War and the \r\nSecond World War or that we asserted following the \r\ngenocides in Kampuchea and Rwanda, still fails to \r\nmobilize us today to solve other situations that are just \r\nas unacceptable, just as intolerable and, on occasion, \r\njust as unimaginable.  \r\n It is not right to compromise multilateralism; it is \r\nespecially wrong to do so when, through a lack of will, \r\nwe affect one or more partners making a desperate \r\nappeal for help. In that regard, we welcome the fact \r\nthat this General Assembly has put climate change at \r\nthe top of its agenda. But how long has it taken us? We \r\nsimply cannot be satisfied with a “better late than \r\nnever”, when in 1987, exactly 20 years ago, President \r\nMaumoon Abdul Gayoom of the Republic of the \r\nMaldives alerted us that he did not come to speak \r\nabout international political issues but rather about “the \r\ndeath of a nation”, the death of a nation whose 1,190 \r\nislands will be virtually submerged with the rise in sea \r\nlevel owing to climate change. The emergency hotline \r\nmust respond not only to 11 September but to all the \r\nemergencies covered by the Charter of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n It is time to pay our debt to nature. We simply \r\ncannot continue to distort the evidence of climate \r\nchange. Regardless of how inconvenient the truth may \r\nbe or what our respective shares of responsibility are, \r\nthe truth is here to stay. Year after year we are \r\nreminded of it with greater frequency and intensity.  \r\n In Costa Rica where the most species per square \r\nkilometre of anywhere in the world are found, we are \r\ncommitted to going beyond our obligations. We have \r\nadopted concrete and sustainable actions, such as \r\nsetting aside 27 per cent of our national territory as \r\npreserves, the generation of energy using renewable \r\nenergy sources for 98 per cent of our generating \r\ncapacity, the introduction of environmental service \r\npayments and the commitment to advance towards a \r\ncarbon-neutral economy by the year 2021. However, no \r\nmatter how sustainable our commitment at the national \r\nlevel, our efforts will have less impact if they are not \r\nmet by similar commitments in other parts of the \r\nworld. Since climate change does not recognize \r\nborders, others with large environmental debts simply \r\ncannot continue to live in debt, as this accelerates the \r\ncoming of the day of judgement.  \r\n Although we have seen some strides in \r\ninternational environmental governance at both the \r\nglobal and regional levels, we continue to be indebted \r\nto nature. The Kyoto Protocol is an incomplete \r\ninstrument, not only because it has not attained \r\nuniversality, but also because it does not incentivize \r\nthe sustainability of the primary forest and its \r\necosystem. In that respect, Costa Rica is working on \r\ncompensatory mechanisms to avoid deforestation with \r\ndifferent intergovernmental groups, such as the \r\nCoalition for Rainforest Nations and the Group of 11, \r\nto make sure that the post-Kyoto scheme does not \r\nexclude primary forests.  \r\n We cannot compromise on multilateralism. It is \r\nunrealistic to press others for compliance with the \r\nobligations that arise from the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), \r\nwhile disregarding one’s own obligations. Both treaties \r\nand all of their articles are part of an intricate \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n27 07-52428 \r\n \r\narchitecture of mutual trust that does not allow for any \r\npartial constructs. We must avoid both horizontal and \r\nvertical proliferation, promote compliance with all of \r\nthe obligations that arise from those treaties and \r\ncondemn every attempt to break the regime of mutual \r\ntrust. We cannot allow for the proliferation of \r\nexceptions to non-proliferation.  \r\n Multilateralism is not built on a show of strength. \r\nIn 2006, the world reached a record $1.2 trillion in \r\nmilitary spending. According to the Millennium \r\nProject, with one tenth of this amount, that is, $121 \r\nbillion, we would have met the targets for 2006 for all \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in all \r\ncountries of the world. In 2006, on average, for every \r\ndollar spent on official development assistance by the \r\nmember States of the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development, $7.5 were spent on \r\nweapons. \r\n Security does not come from multiplying \r\nweapons; history has proven this time and time again. \r\nSecurity comes from remedying injustices, easing \r\nshortages and creating opportunities so that we can \r\nhave collective prosperity on par with collective \r\nsecurity. In this regard, Costa Rica has been calling for \r\ncompliance with the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nArticle 26 of which commits us to promote “the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security with \r\nthe least diversion for armaments of the world’s human \r\nand economic resources”. Thus says the dead letter of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. \r\n It is in this spirit that we have pressed for the \r\nadoption of an arms trade treaty, a legally binding \r\ninstrument that codifies the existing obligations of \r\nStates under international law that may apply to the \r\narms trade. Therefore we celebrate the adoption, by a \r\nsignificant majority, of Assembly resolution 61/89, \r\nwhich allows us to re-activate this noble objective of \r\nthe Charter. \r\n It is also in this spirit that we have called for the \r\nanimation of the Costa Rica Consensus, so that \r\ninternational donors can reward those developing \r\ncountries that are making sustainable and verifiable \r\nefforts to meet the most pressing social needs, \r\nincluding the MDGs, while increasing social \r\ninvestment and reducing military spending. \r\n Multilateralism requires a shared sense of \r\nurgency. We need to face all global threats, all global \r\nchallenges in a timely fashion, not creating a world \r\nwith two different speeds: one in which we need two \r\ndecades to respond to the call made by President \r\nGayoom, among others, and another in which we \r\nrespond in a just a few days, with binding resolutions \r\nlike Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) or 1540 \r\n(2004). \r\n Our commitment to combat terrorism must aim at \r\nprevailing not only over the terrorists, but also over the \r\nroot causes from which they draw strengthen and \r\nrenewal. In this regard, it is as important to combat the \r\nmanifestations of terrorism, its financial channels and \r\nphysical hideouts as it is to fight the poverty and \r\ndespair that provide an easy harvest for extremists. To \r\nsucceed we can no longer afford to be late in dealing \r\nwith the challenges of development. \r\n Multilateralism also requires a shared sense of \r\njustice. For that, we need more States to ratify the \r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. As \r\nwe advance towards the universality of the Statute and \r\nthe acceptance of its complementary jurisdiction, we \r\nwill close the gaps and loopholes by which the worst \r\ncriminals in the world escape and hide. \r\n Finally, we must have the courage to look at \r\nourselves in the mirror, as an Organization and as \r\nMember States. We cannot permit this Organization’s \r\nfoundations to be weakened by a few errors. We need \r\nto learn from our mistakes and allow space for self-\r\ncriticism. We do a disservice to the credibility and the \r\neffectiveness of this Organization if, each time a \r\ndifficult or inconvenient situation arises, we simply \r\nproduce a report for the archives. Our scant follow-up \r\nto the reports on Srebrenica and the Oil-for-Food \r\nProgramme provides two clear examples of our \r\napparent incapacity for learning. \r\n As Harry Truman said, referring to the convening \r\nof the San Francisco Conference, “it was important for \r\nus to make a start, no matter how imperfect”. Since \r\n1945, this Organization has expanded and changed, \r\nimproving through experience and reform, \r\nincorporating more and more cultures and views, \r\nputting into practice, with more or less success, the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. This \r\nOrganization certainly does not have all the answers \r\nand does not possess all the resources required, for in \r\nthe end, it is restrained by the lowest common \r\ndenominator, that is, by ourselves, the Member States. \r\n We have a world of reasons to persevere and \r\nprevail over the challenges we face. Neither the \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 28 \r\n \r\nchronic pessimism of some nor the ungrateful egoism \r\nof others will check the slow but determined march \r\nforward of those of us who believe in multilateralism \r\nand in a future of greater shared welfare for all. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela. \r\n Mr. Maduro Moros (Venezuela) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Our people, from the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, have followed last week’s debate of \r\nGeneral Assembly. They are a people in the middle of a \r\nrevolution that has succeeded in building new spaces \r\nfor a political culture; a people that is informed and \r\neducated, that has followed closely the positions put \r\nforward at this Assembly. We could say that the debate \r\nhas reflected the current situation in the world, a world \r\nthat is struggling to build itself in peace, a world that is \r\nseeking new directions. \r\n A year ago, the President Hugo Chávez Frías \r\nspoke from this podium to warn the world, to confirm \r\nthe alert of many in the world on the madness, the \r\nwarmongering madness that has been imposed \r\nalongside the desire for peace, a desire of the majority \r\nof the world.  \r\n Today, we can take stock of this warmongering \r\nmadness. Six years ago, through a lie, invasion and \r\naggression were sold to a brotherly people, the people \r\nof Iraq. It was built on the basis of a global campaign, \r\na justification for the military occupation of the Arab \r\npeople of Iraq, of the Iraqi nation. \r\n Today, five years later, we can see the result of a \r\npolicy filled with hate and evil. From 2002 to 2006 of \r\nthe United States budget, $610 billion have been \r\ninvested in maintaining the war in the Middle East — \r\n$610 billion to bring about death and destruction, $610 \r\nbillion that were taken from American taxpayers in \r\norder to invest in bullets, bombs and death. That $610 \r\nbillion invested in war, if it had been invested during \r\nthe past six years that the Iraqi occupation has lasted, \r\ntoday could have meant social progress, equality and \r\njustice for the people of Iraq. \r\n But the results are obvious, and clearly visible. \r\nResearch by the world’s universities states that more \r\nthan 600,000 Iraqis have died as a result of the \r\ninvasion and military occupation. More than the 3,600 \r\nyoung American were sent to their deaths. More than \r\n25,000 young Americans have now returned to their \r\ncountry crippled, blind, deaf or disabled for life. The \r\n$610 billion invested in death has only multiplied the \r\nviolence, and the result that we see today is that the \r\ninvasion has not led to a safer or more balanced world. \r\nThe result has not been a world at peace. Today, the \r\nnations of the world must acknowledge that we have a \r\nworld that is less safe, with greater dangers because of \r\nterrorism. We have an unbalanced Middle East, filled \r\nwith violence and divisions.  \r\n If that $610 billion invested in war and death in \r\nIraq had been invested in life, we would be looking at a \r\ndifferent situation today. With $610 billion, we could \r\nbuild 3 million clinics to provide health services to the \r\nworld, as is done today by the people of Cuba and \r\nVenezuela through the Bolivarian Alternative for the \r\nAmericas for people throughout Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. With the $610 billion invested in war, we \r\ncould build more than 12 million decent homes for \r\nneedy men and women of the three neediest latitudes \r\nof the world: Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. With that $610 billion invested in bullets \r\nand bombs for the purpose of killing, we could have \r\nbuilt more than 300,000 schools that would have \r\nreceived at least 350 million children and young \r\nstudents around the world.  \r\n But no, madness and greediness for the natural \r\nresources of the world lead the elites of the United \r\nStates to undertake an absurd and irrational war and to \r\nbring violence and death to the world. Today, if we \r\ntook stock of the situation, of the direct results of this \r\nsenseless and irrational war, we would have to say that \r\nthis war has led to death, destruction and \r\ndestabilization and has created even more sources of \r\nterrorism than it has been able to heal. That is why this \r\nsenseless war is the worst example of how the security \r\nsystem has functioned to protect balance and peace in \r\nthe world. \r\n Today, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela calls \r\nupon our brothers in the world to think. We must adjust \r\nthe mechanisms to find balance and peace and to stop \r\nthe madness of war.  \r\n We have seen how in recent days there has been \r\nan increase in the international media campaign to \r\ndemonize the people and Government of Iran. We have \r\nseen how dangerously successive threatening \r\nstatements have been made against the peace of the \r\npeople of Iran. Has the world, or have the \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n29 07-52428 \r\n \r\nGovernments represented in this General Assembly, \r\nwondered what would happen if the insatiable madness \r\nof the elite who govern the United States were to lead \r\nto a dreadful attack on the peaceful people of Iran? \r\nWhere would such a situation lead us? It is time to stop \r\nthat campaign of demonization, to issue warnings, to \r\nbuild restraining walls, to call for an end to, and make \r\nalliances to stop, the belligerent madness of the elite \r\nwho govern the United States of America.  \r\n Today, the war and the struggle against terrorism \r\noccupy a very prominent place in the international \r\npublic agenda. From this podium, we would like to \r\nreiterate to the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica the legal request for the terrorist Luis Posada \r\nCarriles to be extradited, in accordance with \r\ninternational law, and to be prosecuted for the crimes \r\nhe committed in Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nagainst our peoples. Does this Assembly know that one \r\nof the most dangerous terrorists, Luis Posada \r\nCarriles — the head of a terrorist gang, who has been \r\nconvicted of and confessed to crimes committed in \r\nSouth America during Operation Condor, who was \r\nresponsible for the disappearance of hundreds of men \r\nand women, who has been convicted of and confessed \r\nto having blown up a Cubana Airlines plane in \r\nBarbados in 1976 and who placed bombs in tourist \r\nspots in Cuba in the 1990s — is now free in Florida \r\nand protected by the Government of United States of \r\nAmerica? Does this Assembly know that this terrorist \r\nprovided his services to the Central Intelligence \r\nAgency for 40 years?  \r\n We have asked the Counter-Terrorism Committee \r\nof the Security Council to examine that matter with all \r\ndue diligence, and we are asking for the support of \r\nfriendly Governments around the world for this \r\nterrorist to be extradited and prosecuted for having \r\nblown up a Cubana Airlines plane in Venezuela. This \r\ntwo-faced behaviour shows the hypocrisy of a policy \r\nthat fuels war supposedly to combat terrorism but that, \r\non its own territory, protects one of the most dangerous \r\nterrorists that the western hemisphere has ever known.  \r\n Likewise, we wish to express from this podium \r\nour solidarity with the growing call by Governments \r\nand peoples of the world for a fair judgement and the \r\nimmediate release of the five Cubans imprisoned in the \r\njails of the empire as part of the war on terror being \r\ncarried out on United States territory. This demand that \r\nwe are making before the General Assembly today is \r\npart of the flags of struggle that the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela is raising today. \r\n From this podium today, we would like to \r\nwelcome the victory of President Rafael Correa, of the \r\nprogressive forces and of the people of Ecuador in the \r\nrecent elections to designate the Constituent National \r\nAssembly, which will direct the peaceful process of \r\nchange in Ecuador. This victory in Ecuador is part of a \r\ngroup of processes of change that have peacefully and \r\ndemocratically paved the way in South America, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, processes of change that \r\nthey tried to stop through campaigns by national \r\noligarchies, through international conspiracies and \r\nthrough media campaigns. But the voice of the people \r\nof Ecuador is clear. They have joined the voices of the \r\npeople of Bolivia, Venezuela and Uruguay. South \r\nAmerica, Latin America and the Caribbean ask, we \r\ndemand that the right to peaceful democratic change in \r\nour societies be respected. We demand that the right to \r\nbuild, through democratic revolution, new processes \r\nand new economic and social structures be respected, \r\nmaking it possible to overcome poverty and to build \r\ndemocracies that are truly established by equality. \r\n The world knows that there has been an ongoing \r\nconspiracy against the Venezuelan democracy and \r\nPresident Hugo Chávez. The world knows that in 2002 \r\nour people defeated an attempted coup d’état that \r\nsought the destruction of democracy and the \r\nassassination of President Chávez.  \r\n Today, the people of Venezuela are in the midst of \r\na thorough reform of the Constitution. In December, \r\nthe people of Venezuela, following a debate on terms \r\nand proposals related to constitutional reform, will go \r\nto the polls to decide in a sovereign manner what our \r\ncountry’s future should be and what reforms we should \r\nundertake to expand the foundations of political, social \r\nand economic democracy. Today, we reaffirm to the \r\nworld that we want respect for Venezuela’s sovereignty \r\nand independence and an end to imperialist-led media \r\ncampaigns that try to distort the real conditions of \r\ndemocracy building by our people and by our popular \r\nrevolution.  \r\n Today, we reaffirm the need for deep-seated and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations. A new, \r\nmultipolar world of equilibrium, without imperialistic \r\nhegemony, is necessary, urgent and possible. We have \r\njoined the debate on United Nations reform. We \r\nbelieve that the Organization must be reworked. We \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 30 \r\n \r\nbelieve that the Organization must rebuild itself so that \r\nit can faithfully serve a multipolar world, a world of \r\nequilibrium, a world of peace, a world without \r\nhegemony. Seventeen years of a unipolar world has \r\nshown us the need for a deep-seated transformation of \r\nmultilateral organizations so that they can be placed at \r\nthe service of peace, equality, justice and the great \r\ncauses of humanity.  \r\n Today, we reaffirm our conviction that the \r\nOrganization must be thoroughly reworked and must \r\nmove forward by democratizing the Security Council, \r\nexpanding both its permanent and its non-permanent \r\nmembership; by establishing new functions for the \r\nGeneral Assembly; and by strengthening the political \r\nrole of the Secretary-General. \r\n Finally, let us move forward with new \r\nmechanisms for dialogue, coexistence and the building \r\nof a multipolar world where we can all be equal — a \r\nworld where our peoples can see themselves as equal \r\npartners in a global cooperative undertaking to build \r\nthe foundations of peace and justice, to overcome the \r\ninsanity of war and to be able to thwart the desire of \r\nthe world’s elites to take control of the natural \r\nresources and wealth of our people. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms \r\nits will to move forward together with the peoples of \r\nthe world in a thorough reform that will transform the \r\nUnited Nations into a new Organization — a genuine \r\ninstrument for peace, life and development. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency  \r\nMr. Choe Su Hon, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Choe Su Hon (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): On behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, I should like at the outset to congratulate you, \r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session. I am confident \r\nthat your able leadership will ensure the success of our \r\nwork. \r\n I wish to begin my statement by reiterating the \r\nprincipled and just position of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and to emphasize its sincere effort \r\nto resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, \r\nwhich continues to draw the attention of the \r\ninternational community. That issue, as has been made \r\nclear time and again from this very rostrum, is no more \r\nthan a product of the deep-rooted and hostile policy of \r\nthe United States towards the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea — a policy that has lasted for more \r\nthan half a century. \r\n Peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is \r\ndirectly linked to the peace and security of the North-\r\nEast Asian region and of the world as a whole. It is \r\nregrettable, however, that there has never been lasting \r\npeace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Rather, \r\nthere has been a recurring cycle of tension and détente \r\nwhose principal cause is nothing other than the current, \r\nhostile relations between the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States. \r\n As history has proved, no issue can be resolved \r\nby resorting to sanctions and pressure. There has been \r\nno other option for the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea — whose territory and population are \r\nsmall — but to strengthen its military power for self-\r\ndefence, on the basis of Songun politics, to protect its \r\nnational sovereignty and dignity in the face of the \r\nUnited States’ threats of nuclear strikes and harsh \r\neconomic sanctions.  \r\n It is the Songun politics of the respected General \r\nKim Jong Il and our active efforts that guarantee peace \r\nand stability on the Korean peninsula and a strategic \r\nbalance in the North-East Asian region. Our Songun \r\npolitics is a source of great pride and self-confidence \r\nfor us, because it deters military conflict and ensures \r\npeace on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia.  \r\n Our national military power has a self-defensive \r\nnature, since it is intended solely to safeguard our \r\nsovereignty and to fulfil the aspirations of the countries \r\nin the region for peace, security and stability. \r\n Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was the \r\nlifelong teaching of our fatherly leader President Kim \r\nIl Sung, and it has been our consistent position that the \r\nnuclear issue must be resolved peacefully through \r\ndialogue and negotiation. Thanks to our sincere efforts, \r\nseveral rounds of the Six-Party Talks have been held to \r\ndate. That made possible the adoption of Joint \r\nStatement of 19 September 2005, followed by the  \r\n13 February 2007 agreement on initial actions to \r\ndenuclearize the Korean peninsula. The Joint Statement \r\nsets out the obligations of all parties in the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula on the basis \r\nof the principle of “words for words and actions for \r\nactions”. \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n31 07-52428 \r\n \r\n Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not \r\nlead to our unilateral disarmament, but can be achieved \r\nby ending the hostile relations between the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States and \r\nby eliminating all nuclear threats on the Korean \r\npeninsula and in the surrounding region. \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nsuspended the operation of the Nyongbyon nuclear \r\nfacilities and allowed monitoring by the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency, thus fulfilling its obligations \r\nunder the 13 February agreement in a sincere manner. \r\nThe Nyongbyon nuclear facilities are the parent body \r\nof our independent nuclear power industry, built with \r\ntremendous human and material resources. \r\nAccordingly, it is a courageous political decision to \r\nhalt their operation and now pass to the stage of \r\ndisabling them prior to eventual dismantlement. \r\n As we clarified again at the Six-party Talks \r\nrecently held in Beijing, the successful implementation \r\nof the 19 September Joint Statement requires all parties \r\nto fulfil their respective obligations in accordance with \r\nthe principle of “actions for actions”. Specifically, it \r\ndepends on what practical measures the United States \r\nand Japan will take to end their hostile policies towards \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The \r\nUnited States should take steps to change its policy \r\ntowards my country and to normalize bilateral \r\nrelations, while Japan should make a clean break with \r\nits past policy of aggression and crimes and set aside \r\nits hostility towards my country, as it has pledged to \r\ndo. We will watch closely every move on the part of \r\nthe United States and Japan at this stage, the stage that \r\nrequires actions. \r\n Nothing is more urgent or important than the \r\nreunification of the nation, which has had to live with a \r\nterritorial division imposed by outside forces for more \r\nthan half a century. Ever since the early days of the \r\ndivision, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nhas consistently sought to reunify the nation through \r\nindependent dialogue and negotiations between the \r\nnorth and south of Korea, as it sees reunification as the \r\nsupreme national task. The historic North-South Joint \r\nDeclaration of 15 June 2000, a declaration of national \r\nindependence and peaceful reunification, sought to \r\nachieve reunification through concerted efforts in \r\naccordance with the ideal of “by our nation itself”, \r\nthereby rejecting interference from outside forces.  \r\n The north-south summit now under way in \r\nPyongyang opens a significant new phase that augurs \r\nwell for peace, joint prosperity and reunification, \r\ntaking Korean relations to a higher level, in accordance \r\nwith the historic Joint Declaration and the spirit of “our \r\nnation itself”. With the north and the south sitting face \r\nto face in a spirit of national independence and love for \r\ncountry, all problems can surely be resolved in the \r\ninterests of our nation, regardless of differences in \r\nideas and systems. \r\n In order for the objectives of the North-South \r\nJoint Declaration to be achieved and for peace and \r\nreunification to return to the Korean peninsula, the \r\nUnited States policy of hostility towards our country, \r\nand its interference in our nation’s internal affairs, \r\nshould be brought to an end. In any case, the \r\nGovernment of our Republic will make every effort to \r\nbring about national reunification as soon as possible \r\nby emphasizing the concept of one nation, defending \r\npeace, realizing unity under the ideal of “by our nation \r\nitself”, and upholding the banner of the North-South \r\nJoint Declaration. \r\n I would also like to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to Japan’s recent attempt to use militarization \r\nto cast a dark shadow across the future development of \r\nthe Korean peninsula and its neighbours. In addition, \r\nJapan’s discriminatory and repressive acts deny the \r\nnational rights of Koreans in Japan, in violation of \r\ninternational law.  \r\n Japan’s recent manoeuvres against the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nGeneral Association of Korean Residents in Japan \r\n(Chongryon), have driven relations between Japan and \r\nour country to the lowest possible level. In an open \r\nchallenge to the international community’s \r\ndenunciation and condemnation of Japan’s treatment of \r\nKoreans, Japanese authorities have not hesitated to \r\ndistort history, even going so far as to try to conceal \r\nJapan’s bloody past crimes, while turning the “self-\r\ndefence force” into a regular army with a mandate that \r\npermits pre-emptive strikes against other countries by \r\nchanging the “Peace Constitution” into a war \r\nconstitution. \r\n Indeed, Japan’s attempt to eliminate by force the \r\nChongryon, the legitimate overseas organization of \r\ncompatriots from my country, constitutes an \r\ninfringement of the sovereignty of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea as serious as any financial \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 32 \r\n \r\nsanction could be and a massive human rights violation \r\naccording to the provisions of existing international \r\nhuman rights instruments.  \r\n We therefore hope that Japan will truly follow the \r\npath of friendship and peace rather than revive its \r\nunsavoury past. Unless it makes a clean break with its \r\npast crimes, Japan is not entitled to a future.  \r\n Although the first decade of the new millennium \r\nis already nearing its end, our planet has yet to be \r\npeaceful, even for a day. Indeed, world peace and \r\nsecurity are now confronted with serious challenges of \r\never-increasing intensity. Principles of respect for \r\nnational sovereignty and equality — the foundation of \r\nmodern international relations — are threatened by \r\nattempts to extend and expand the “war against \r\nterrorism” for self-serving reasons, and by the high-\r\nhandedness and arbitrariness of forces that advocate \r\npre-emptive nuclear strikes and accelerated the \r\nmodernization of nuclear weapons. \r\n The present international situation requires the \r\nUnited Nations to strengthen its central role and \r\nfunctions in resolving such issues as global peace and \r\nsecurity and sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment, in conformity with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nUnilateralism and high-handedness should never be \r\ntolerated, as they violate principles of international law \r\nand the Charter, as well as collective efforts to build a \r\nnew and just world order, based on respect for \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, equality and mutual \r\nbenefit. \r\n Disputes should be resolved peacefully through \r\ndialogue and negotiations. Collective sanctions and the \r\nuse of force in the form of armed aggression against \r\nsovereign States must never be tolerated on any \r\naccount. \r\n The Security Council should be a responsible \r\norgan that truly ensures international peace and \r\nsecurity. It should not be used by certain countries to \r\npromote their own strategic interests. \r\n The peaceful and prosperous new world desired \r\nby humankind must have as its basis fair international \r\nrelations in which the sovereignty of all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations is respected without \r\ndifferentiation and the principles of equality and \r\nmutual benefit are observed. \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\ncontinue to strive for the creation of a just and equal \r\nworld order based on the ideals of independence, peace \r\nand friendship. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Riaz Mohammad Khan, Foreign \r\nSecretary of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. \r\n Mr. Khan (Pakistan): I would like first to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to \r\nyour prestigious office. Your vast political experience \r\nand diplomatic skills will undoubtedly guide the \r\nGeneral Assembly towards success in dealing with its \r\nimportant agenda. I wish to express our deep \r\nsatisfaction and pride at the significant achievements \r\nof your predecessor, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, during her presidency. Her stature \r\nand accomplishments symbolize the prominent role \r\nthat women are playing in the Muslim world. \r\n Let me also express our high appreciation to \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon for the distinctive and assiduous \r\nmanner in which, as our new Secretary-General, he has \r\nengaged himself to address crises and humanitarian \r\nsituations. We support the Secretary-General’s \r\ncommitment to improving the United Nations so that it \r\ncan respond to contemporary challenges and \r\nopportunities. \r\n The end of the cold war at the dawn of the \r\ntwenty-first century gave rise to hopes for a better \r\nfuture. A decade later, the world is in the grip of \r\ndeepening uncertainty and rising turbulence. There are \r\nnew threats of terrorism, violence and widening \r\ndivisions among cultures and societies, driven by \r\nsuspicion and prejudice. At the heart of that growing \r\nmalaise is not a clash of values or civilizations; it is the \r\nfailure of the international community to address \r\nfestering disputes and our collective inability to \r\nuniversalize the opportunities and benefits offered by \r\nthe phenomenal advances of technology and \r\nglobalization for the betterment of all peoples. \r\n Conflicts continue in Palestine, Iraq and \r\nAfghanistan. In South Asia, the Kashmir dispute is yet \r\nto be resolved. Old disputes are compounded by new \r\nconfrontations. Also, serious challenges are emerging \r\nin the shape of climate change, energy security, and \r\nfinancial and trade imbalances.  \r\n In this complex world, the United Nations \r\nprovides a critical and indispensable role. The United \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n33 07-52428 \r\n \r\nNations is at the apex of expanding international \r\ninteraction and remains the only acknowledged \r\ninstrument for regulating global affairs on the basis of \r\nagreed principles and norms. \r\n Terrorism is a grave and pervasive threat. \r\nTerrorism destabilizes societies. It must not be \r\nassociated with any faith or culture. It must be \r\ncountered and rejected, addressing both its \r\nmanifestations and its root causes. \r\n Equally disturbing are trends to malign other \r\ncultures and faiths and reinforce divisions, especially \r\nbetween the West and the Islamic world. Tolerating \r\nIslamophobia in the guise of freedom of expression is \r\ndangerous. More than ever before, in this globalized \r\nworld we need understanding, harmony and the \r\nbuilding of bridges among all cultures and peoples \r\nthrough such initiatives as the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, interfaith dialogue and enlightened \r\nmoderation. \r\n Conflict and violence in the Middle East are \r\nfundamentally linked to the Palestinian issue that has \r\nagitated two generations of Palestinians and Muslims \r\naround the world. Essentially, Palestine is an issue of \r\nfreedom. Security cannot be ensured by denying the \r\nPalestinians their freedom. Salvation lies in what the \r\nArab nations proposed in Beirut five years ago. \r\nPakistan supports that position. The world has a \r\nhistorical responsibility to end the tragedy of the \r\nPalestinian people by enabling them to establish their \r\nown State in Palestine, consistent with Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the \r\nArab peace plan. Israel must also withdraw from the \r\nother occupied Arab territories and fully respect the \r\nterritorial and sovereign integrity of Lebanon. Efforts \r\nthat deflect from those basic imperatives will only \r\nprolong agony and turmoil in the region. \r\n Pakistan is deeply concerned over the grave \r\nsituation in Iraq. We deplore the internecine bloodshed. \r\nPeace in Iraq can emerge only through dialogue, \r\nmutual cooperation and tolerance. It is vital both for \r\nthe Iraqi people and for the region to ensure the \r\npreservation of the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq \r\nand full respect for its sovereignty. \r\n Pakistan is also disturbed by the ominous \r\nconfrontation over Iran’s nuclear issue. We have \r\ninsisted on recourse to diplomacy because resort to the \r\nuse of force could lead to incalculable consequences \r\nfor that already inflamed and highly sensitive region. \r\n In our region, violence and the rise of terrorism \r\nand extremism are due to the developments of the \r\nnearly three decades when neighbouring Afghanistan \r\nbecame the last front of the cold war. Ironically, in the \r\n1980s the struggle in Afghanistan helped the \r\nconsolidation of freedom movements that culminated \r\nin the surge of freedom signified by the fall of the \r\nBerlin wall. In the 1990s, however, Afghanistan \r\nsuffered international neglect and indifference until the \r\nshock and horror of 9/11 refocused international \r\nattention on that war-ravaged country. \r\n The unfortunate happenings in our \r\nneighbourhood impacted on our own society, giving \r\nrise to terrorism and extremism, especially in the tribal \r\nregions bordering Afghanistan. We are fighting \r\nAl-Qaida and other terrorist elements with resolve and \r\ndetermination. We have deployed nearly 100,000 \r\ntroops for that purpose. A large number of our troops \r\nhave sacrificed their lives. In the tribal regions, we \r\nhave taken political and administrative measures and \r\nhave plans to bring about socio-economic \r\ntransformation. As part of a comprehensive strategy, \r\nwe have introduced reforms to counter extremism. \r\n We are cooperating internationally and reject \r\nirresponsible comments and insinuations, especially in \r\ncertain sections of the international media, casting \r\naspersions on our intentions and efforts. It must be \r\nappreciated that the challenge is enormous and requires \r\na sustained and protracted endeavour both locally and \r\nat the international level. \r\n Pakistan desires a peaceful environment in the \r\nregion. No country stands to gain as much as Pakistan \r\nfrom peace and stability in Afghanistan. We therefore \r\nsupport every initiative that could help the Afghans to \r\nachieve national reconciliation and to rebuild their \r\ncountry. The recently convened Grand Jirga in Kabul \r\noffers hope. A great deal will depend on the \r\neffectiveness of the follow-up mechanisms, especially \r\nthe 50-member joint council that is mandated to reach \r\nout to the opposition to promote peace in the area. The \r\ninternational community also has an important \r\nresponsibility to help Afghanistan with a Marshall \r\nPlan-like programme for reconstruction. \r\n Pakistan is engaged in a peace process with India \r\nthat has led to significant improvement in bilateral \r\nrelations. The two countries must now seize the \r\nopportunity provided by the propitious international \r\nand regional environment to address problems, \r\nA/62/PV.14  \r\n \r\n07-52428 34 \r\n \r\nespecially the Jammu and Kashmir dispute that has \r\nbeen at the heart of conflict and tension in South Asia. \r\nBoth sides will have to demonstrate political will, \r\ncourage and flexibility. We are pursuing a solution that \r\nwould be acceptable to India, to Pakistan and, above \r\nall, to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. \r\n President Pervez Musharraf has offered important \r\nideas that have resonated with the Kashmiri people, \r\nwho must be involved in the process. At the same time, \r\nit is essential to create an environment free of human \r\nrights violations in Kashmir if there is to be a \r\nsustainable peaceful solution. A peaceful settlement \r\nresponding to the aspirations of the Kashmiri people \r\nwill usher in a new era of mutual trust and cooperation \r\nin South Asia. \r\n In our region, the incipient United States-India \r\nnuclear deal injects a new element. We have concerns \r\nover strategic stability, which we will maintain despite \r\nour firm opposition to an arms race in South Asia. \r\nMoreover, we also have a strong interest in developing \r\ncivil nuclear power generation under international \r\nsafeguards. Our nuclear and strategic assets are solely \r\nfor defensive purpose. We started pursuing the nuclear \r\noption only after 1974, when the strategic balance was \r\ndisrupted by the first Indian nuclear test. Our initiatives \r\nto keep South Asia free of nuclear weapons received \r\nscant response internationally. In 1998, we were again \r\nfaced with a dilemma and had to respond to the Indian \r\ntests to establish deterrence. Our failure to do so would \r\nhave created a dangerous ambiguity about our \r\ncapability, with the risk of miscalculation. \r\n I wish to reaffirm that our strategic capability is \r\nsolely for deterrence and defence. We are opposed to \r\nan arms race and want to maintain minimum credible \r\ndeterrence. We will not be the first to test in our region. \r\nWe will never use our nuclear capability against \r\nnon-nuclear weapon States. We remain fully committed \r\nto the objective of general and complete disarmament \r\nand nuclear non-proliferation. We want to be treated as \r\na partner rather than as a target of the global nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime. We are committed to \r\ndeveloping nuclear power generation under \r\ninternational safeguards to meet our growing energy \r\nneeds. \r\n It is evident that global consensus on \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation has been seriously \r\neroded. There are several reasons for that, including \r\nthe disavowal of nuclear disarmament by the nuclear-\r\nweapon States signatories to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); the \r\nemergence of de facto nuclear-weapon States not \r\nparties to the NPT; the failure to address the security \r\nconcerns of non-nuclear-weapon States; and \r\ndiscrimination in the conduct of peaceful nuclear \r\ncooperation. There is an obvious need for a new and \r\nuniversal consensus on non-proliferation, disarmament \r\nand peaceful nuclear cooperation that eliminates \r\ndangers and risks and establishes cooperation on an \r\nequitable basis. In the coming months, the Nuclear \r\nSuppliers Group States have a heavy responsibility, as \r\nany endorsement of a selective or discriminatory \r\napproach could fatefully damage the existing \r\nconsensus on disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\n The world is slowly recognizing the existential \r\nthreat posed by climate change. The special event held \r\non 24 September has been useful in crystallizing the \r\nissues that must be addressed. Environment is a \r\nresponsibility and an opportunity. The responsibility is \r\nto heal the Earth, which is scarred and degraded. The \r\nchallenge goes far beyond Kyoto. Collectively, we \r\nneed to restrain our avaricious and extravagant living. \r\nOpportunity lies in developing the environment as an \r\nemployment sector to absorb a part of world human \r\nresources in meaningful activity. We must realize that \r\nwith technological advances it will no longer be \r\nfeasible to rationally utilize the entire global work \r\nforce in the production, manufacturing and service \r\nsectors. \r\n Against the backdrop of the new challenges, large \r\nparts of humanity continue to suffer from hunger, \r\npoverty and disease. That is tragic in these modern \r\ntimes, where the miracle of technology has empowered \r\nthe world to effectively overcome the vestiges of our \r\nprimitive existence. The Group of 77 has therefore \r\ninsisted on a broad endeavour for sustainable \r\ndevelopment based on economic growth, social \r\ndevelopment and environmental protection. We should \r\nadopt coherent and mutually reinforcing policies and \r\nactions to advance in those three directions with the \r\nsame degree of political and legal commitment. The \r\nUnited Nations has a central role in the realization of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. \r\n Pakistan, as the current Chair of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, has suggested steps to enable developing \r\ncountries to coordinate and enlarge their national \r\ndevelopment cooperation effort. In accordance with the \r\n A/62/PV.14\r\n \r\n35 07-52428 \r\n \r\nmandate adopted at the Second South Summit, we will \r\nconvene a panel of eminent experts of the South to \r\nfurther develop common positions for developing \r\ncountries in critical areas like trade finance, \r\ntechnology, energy and climate change. \r\n Pakistan agrees that the management and \r\nSecretariat of the United Nations should be reformed \r\nand modernized, especially to improve the coherence \r\nand effectiveness of the system. Prime Minister \r\nShaukat Aziz is the Co-Chair of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence. \r\nThe reform process must, however, remain sensitive to \r\nthe fundamental principle of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates in the decision-making process. That applies \r\nespecially to the issue of the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil. Security Council reform must enlarge the \r\nrepresentation of all Member States rather than expand \r\nthe circle of the privileged. The Security Council \r\nfunctions must also be developed in a manner so that \r\nthese do not eclipse the Charter responsibilities of the \r\nGeneral Assembly or those of the other principal \r\norgans of the United Nations. \r\n In Pakistan, our aspirations are the same as \r\nelsewhere: to accelerate our socio-economic \r\ndevelopment, to build a knowledge-based society and \r\n \r\nto contribute to peace and development in the world \r\nconsistent with the deeply held values of our faith and \r\nour vision for a modern progressive Islamic state. That \r\nhas been the orientation of the Government of \r\nPresident Musharraf for setting priorities and \r\nintroducing reform programmes. There have been \r\nsignificant accomplishments in strengthening \r\ninstitutions, promoting democratic polity and building \r\na sound economy. \r\n To give a few examples, today we have robust \r\ngrass-roots level democratic institutions with \r\nmandatory one-third representation by women. Our \r\nminorities have been integrated into the political \r\nmainstream. Our media is free, vibrant and assertive. \r\nOur economy has seen stable growth over the past \r\neight years, and in that period, Pakistan’s national \r\noutput and per capita income has doubled. We are now \r\npreparing for elections, as our elected national and \r\nprovincial assemblies will soon complete their full \r\nterm of office. As we enter this important phase in our \r\npolitical life, we do so with the deep awareness that a \r\nstrong and stable Pakistan is pivotal for the peace and \r\nprogress of our region. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.50 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
