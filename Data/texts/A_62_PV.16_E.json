(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mr. Volodymyr \r\nKhandogiy, First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Ukraine.  \r\n Mr. Khandogiy (Ukraine): Allow me, first of all, \r\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to \r\nthe high post of President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session. On behalf of my delegation, \r\nlet me wish you, sir, every success in your important \r\nmission and assure you of our full support. \r\n I would like to extend warm words of \r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mrs. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain, whose \r\nextensive diplomatic experience and skilful guidance \r\nthroughout the sixty-first session greatly contributed to \r\nits success. \r\n Allow me also to take this opportunity to express \r\nour support for the ambitious plans and consistent \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to \r\nre-energize the Organization, strengthen its capacity \r\nand update the United Nations system in the new \r\ncentury. \r\n International terrorism remains one of the most \r\nserious threats facing humankind today. Last year the \r\nGeneral Assembly, by adopting the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy, made a concrete \r\ncontribution to combat terrorism in a coordinated \r\nmanner at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels. We believe that the adoption of a definition of \r\nterrorism during the current session would be a starting \r\npoint in assessing counter-terrorism measures taken by \r\neach State. \r\n My country joined the anti-terrorist coalition at \r\nits inception and has made a significant contribution to \r\nits activities. In the last five years, all 13 international \r\ncounter-terrorism treaties have been ratified by the \r\nUkrainian Parliament. \r\n On the governmental level, we support \r\ninternational anti-terrorist efforts, in particular, through \r\nparticipation in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \r\nTerrorism. This fall, we plan to organize in Ukraine the \r\nthird international forum on measures to counteract \r\nacts of nuclear terrorism with the participation of civil \r\nsociety, scholars and non-governmental organizations.  \r\n Disarmament and non-proliferation are among the \r\nmost important challenges on our agenda. As a country \r\nthat voluntarily renounced its military nuclear arsenals, \r\nUkraine is truly disappointed that a world without \r\nweapons of mass destruction (WMDs) remains a \r\ndistant dream. \r\n The international community continues to be \r\nintimidated by the threat of WMD proliferation. The \r\nstrengthening of international legal norms and political \r\ninstrument to prevent WMD proliferation remains a top \r\npriority. In this regard, I would like to stress the \r\nimportance of the universalization of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, as well as the \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 2 \r\n \r\nBiological and Toxin Weapons Convention. \r\nCommemorating in 2007 the tenth anniversary of the \r\nChemical Weapons Convention (CWC), Ukraine is \r\nready to contribute to the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) efforts on \r\nensuring universal adherence to the CWC, particularly \r\nby Middle East countries. \r\n With this in mind, Ukraine proposes to host next \r\nyear, together with the OPCW, an international \r\nconference with the participation of, inter alia, \r\ncountries from the Middle East and North Africa. The \r\nanticipated outcome of such a conference might be a \r\njoint statement of the intention of the countries \r\nconcerned to adhere to the CWC. \r\n We are convinced that the only way forward is to \r\nmake simultaneous progress in the areas of both non-\r\nproliferation and disarmament. \r\n We cannot but underscore our concerns over the \r\nrecent tendencies that have already caused the erosion \r\nof the multilateral regime in the arms control and \r\ndisarmament spheres with a negative impact on mutual \r\ntrust and confidence among States. The very recent \r\nevents around the Treaty on Conventional Armed \r\nForces in Europe have seriously put into question the \r\nfuture of this important arms control instrument, \r\nwidely recognized as the cornerstone of European \r\nsecurity. \r\n Speaking about global peace and security, I \r\ncannot but draw attention to the problem of the \r\nprotracted conflicts in the GUAM Group area. These \r\nconflicts create instability and insecurity and constitute \r\na threat to peace in the region. There is no doubt that \r\nthese conflicts endanger the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the countries of the region, while also \r\nhampering their economic and social development. \r\n We are concerned that numerous international \r\nefforts to settle those conflicts have yielded no results. \r\nIt is crucially important that the world community \r\ncontinue taking practical steps to that end. In our \r\nopinion, the United Nations, regional organizations and \r\nother relevant mechanisms should harmoniously \r\ncomplement one another, using their comparative \r\nadvantages in peacemaking efforts. \r\n In this context, I would like to stress Ukraine’s \r\nunequivocal support for a lasting settlement in Kosovo. \r\nThat objective cannot be achieved by undertaking \r\nunilateral steps nor by steps seeking to bypass the \r\nUnited Nations. A hasty settlement can only destabilize \r\nthe situation in the region and have negative \r\nimplications for the entire system of international \r\nrelations, since similar scenarios could be pursued by \r\nseparatist entities in other regions. \r\n Ukraine has always supported United Nations \r\npeacekeeping efforts, both politically and practically. \r\nWe are glad to note that the recent noticeable increase \r\nin peacekeeping activities has taken place in \r\naccordance with the reform strategy of Peace \r\nOperations 2010. That is especially important in light \r\nof the ongoing and expected deployments in the future. \r\nIn this context, Ukraine supports the Secretary-General \r\nin his efforts to strengthen the United Nations capacity \r\nto manage and sustain peace operations. \r\n I would also like to draw your attention to the \r\nfact that next year will mark the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. In this \r\nregard, our delegation proposes to adopt, at the sixty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly, a special \r\ndeclaration to commemorate this event. \r\n United Nations credibility will always be \r\nmeasured by its ability to respond adequately to \r\nvarious threats in all regions of the world. No \r\norganization is better equipped to deal with those \r\nissues. The United Nations should lead multilateral \r\nefforts with a view to reaching solutions in the interest \r\nof all. But, to address them effectively, we need to take \r\nfurther steps in reforming and improving existing \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations in order to make \r\nthis Organization more relevant in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n Unfortunately, the process of reforming the \r\nSecurity Council, which is the key element within the \r\nprocess of renewing the United Nations, is still only an \r\nagenda item. We are of the view that the reform \r\nprocess can only benefit from new, creative approaches \r\nthat will eventually bring about tangible results. In this \r\nregard, I would like, once again, to stress Ukraine’s \r\nposition that one of the necessary elements of Security \r\nCouncil reform should be the allocation of an \r\nadditional non-permanent seat to the Group of Eastern \r\nEuropean and other States, whose membership has \r\nmore than doubled since 1991. \r\n In today’s world, adherence to sound economic, \r\nsocial and environmental policies and good governance \r\nare the key factors in achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We share the view, expressed in a \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n3 07-52646 \r\n \r\nnumber of statements during this session, that \r\nsustainable development is a global challenge. Ukraine \r\nbelieves that only through concerted efforts, using \r\nuniversal, multilateral mechanisms as well as regional \r\nand subregional forums, will those challenges be \r\nadequately addressed. \r\n For Ukraine and other countries of the region, the \r\nOrganization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation \r\nhas become an important element in achieving \r\ninternationally agreed Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n At the same time, the forces of nature, \r\ncomplemented by reckless and irresponsible human \r\nbehaviour can disrupt development plans, reshape \r\ncontinents and even wipe out whole countries from the \r\nworld’s map. Science has shown, on many occasions, \r\nthat climate change, global warming and pollution may \r\ncause sudden and dramatic consequences if not \r\naddressed in timely, proper and effective ways. Ukraine \r\nis firmly committed to the international agreements in \r\nthe area of climate change, including the United \r\nNations Framework Convention to Combat Climate \r\nChange and the Kyoto Protocol. \r\n This year, we marked the twenty-first anniversary \r\nof the Chernobyl catastrophe, the worst technological \r\ndisaster ever faced by humankind. Chernobyl severely \r\naffected my country and the entire region. We call upon \r\nUnited Nations agencies and individual donors to \r\ncontinue to provide assistance to the affected States \r\nand to work together on the implementation of the \r\nrelevant programmes in a spirit of cooperation. \r\n Ukraine, as a 2007 coordinator of the Chernobyl \r\nAgenda, has proposed, together with the Republic of \r\nBelarus and the Russian Federation, the adoption at the \r\nsixty-second United Nations General Assembly \r\nsession, of a new resolution on strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation to mitigate the consequences \r\nof the Chernobyl disaster. In this regard, we would \r\nwelcome broad support for that initiative during this \r\nGeneral Assembly session. \r\n Ukraine is approaching the seventy-fifth \r\nanniversary of one of the most tragic pages in its \r\nhistory — the Holodomor — or Great Famine. The \r\nartificial famine of 1932-33, perpetrated by the Soviet \r\ntotalitarian regime for the purpose of annihilating the \r\nrural population, the backbone of the Ukrainian nation, \r\ntook the lives of millions of innocent people. For more \r\nthan seven decades this horrific crime, which ranks \r\namong the worst catastrophes ever experienced by \r\nhumankind, still awaits adequate international \r\ncondemnation.  \r\n We sincerely hope that the United Nations, as a \r\ncollective moral authority and effective instrument in \r\nsafeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, \r\nwill raise its voice and denounce the horrendous \r\ndisaster that was purposely inflicted on the Ukrainian \r\npopulation in the early 1930s. By doing so, due tribute \r\nwill be paid to honour the memory of millions of our \r\ncompatriots who were outrageously deprived of their \r\nlives. It is important to remember the past in order to \r\nlearn from it and to avoid repeating crimes against \r\nhumankind in the future. \r\n A decision of the General Assembly to establish \r\nan international day of remembrance of victims of \r\ngenocide would be a worthwhile and timely \r\ncontribution to the attainment of that goal. Likewise, it \r\ncould facilitate the effective implementation of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide, as the world approaches the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of those instruments in 2008. We \r\nare confident that this event deserves the adoption of a \r\nspecial resolution.  \r\n In the context of human rights, Ukraine attaches \r\ngreat importance to the harmonious coexistence of \r\ncivilizations, dialogue and cooperation among various \r\ncultures and peoples. In this regard, we support the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations established under the \r\ninitiative of the Prime Ministers of Spain and Turkey, \r\nand we intend to join the Group of Friends of the \r\nAlliance in the near future. \r\n The problems before us are daunting. We believe \r\nthat the United Nations is the only Organization with \r\nthe worldwide membership, global reach and universal \r\nlegitimacy needed to address today’s global threats and \r\nchallenges, which no country can resolve on its own. \r\n I take this opportunity to reaffirm Ukraine’s \r\nreadiness to continue making an active contribution to \r\nthe further strengthening of our Organization. \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency  \r\nMs. Billie A. Miller, Senior Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados. \r\n Ms. Miller (Barbados): It is my pleasure to join \r\nwith the preceding speakers in congratulating you on \r\nyour election to preside over the sixty-second session \r\nof the United Nations General Assembly. The Barbados \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 4 \r\n \r\ndelegation extends its appreciation to your predecessor, \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \r\nleadership of the sixty-first session and also takes the \r\nopportunity to offer its formal welcome to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon. \r\n Since its independence in 1966, Barbados has \r\nbeen actively participating in the formulation of \r\ninternational policy on a number of issues of universal \r\nconcern and promoting the centrality of the United \r\nNations in the global development debate. We are \r\nproud to have made our contribution to the critical \r\nnegotiating processes on the development agenda. \r\nMuch work, however, needs to be done. \r\n Permit me to use this occasion to identify those \r\noutstanding areas to which Barbados accords \r\noutstanding importance and where we consider that \r\nurgent results-oriented action must be taken by the \r\ninternational community. I refer specifically to the \r\neffective and comprehensive implementation of the \r\nglobal partnership for development as set out in the \r\nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus, the \r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation, the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius International \r\nStrategy; the provision of stable, predictable and \r\nadequate financial resources for the implementation of \r\ndevelopment commitments; the creation of a more \r\nenabling international environment that would \r\nfacilitate the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by a majority of \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the most vulnerable \r\namong them; the recognition by the international \r\ncommunity of the importance of providing continued \r\nsupport for the needs of middle-income developing \r\ncountries; the implementation of existing global \r\nagreements on climate change as well as the early \r\nadoption of an ambitious and comprehensive post-\r\nKyoto agreement; the protection and sustainable \r\nmanagement of the Caribbean Sea; the successful \r\nconclusion of the Doha round of trade negotiations, \r\nwith development as a central component of its \r\noutcome; the promotion of international cooperation on \r\ntax matters; the need for United Nations reinforcement \r\nof its commitment to assist all Member States in their \r\nefforts to combat the problems associated with the \r\ntrafficking in and trans-shipment of illegal drugs, as \r\nwell as the consequent increase in violent crime; and, \r\nfinally, the need for progress on Security Council \r\nreform and for sustained emphasis on revitalizing the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n The gap between promises and implementation \r\ncontinues to frustrate our achievement of the full range \r\nof internationally agreed development goals. The level \r\nof international cooperation and resources committed \r\nby development partners has been woefully inadequate. \r\nSmall island developing States, for example, have had, \r\nto date, to assume the majority portion of the \r\nimplementation burden of the Barbados Programme of \r\nAction and the Mauritius Strategy, despite the fact that \r\nthese goals were determined by the consensus of the \r\nentire international community. Similarly, the needs of \r\nmiddle-income developing countries were not \r\nadequately addressed through the Monterrey \r\nConsensus on Financing for Development, and they \r\ncontinue to be deprived of the vital development \r\nsupport they require to complete the transition. Next \r\nyear’s Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development must seek to redress this \r\nsituation. \r\n There remain only eight years before we reach \r\nour target date of 2015 for the achievement of the \r\nMDGs. We must identify effective strategies to \r\ntransform Member States’ political commitment to the \r\nMDGs into results-oriented, concrete action. We must \r\nforge strategic partnerships, not only within and across \r\nnational borders that encompass varying levels of \r\ndevelopment and economic prosperity, but also among \r\nthe private sector, the public sector and civil society. \r\n It can no longer be denied that climate change is \r\nan alarming phenomenon that requires focused \r\nattention and urgent and decisive global action by the \r\ninternational community. I warmly commend the \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his initiative to \r\nconvene the high-level event on climate change on  \r\n24 September. The presence of so large a number of \r\nheads of State and Government at that important \r\nsession is a clear indication that the grave dimensions \r\nof the problem have been recognized and the need for \r\nbold political leadership fully understood. \r\n If we continue to delay action, we will be judged \r\nharshly, and deservedly so, for callously placing the \r\ninheritance of future generations in greater jeopardy. \r\nFor today, we may have choices; tomorrow, they will \r\nnot. \r\n Barbados is a small, low-lying island State, \r\nhighly dependent on its coastal and marine \r\nenvironment for its economic activity. For its people, \r\nthe stakes could not be higher. Climate change not only \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n5 07-52646 \r\n \r\nrepresents the most serious challenge to our sustainable \r\ndevelopment, it also threatens our very survival. Prime \r\nMinister Arthur of Barbados said at the 24 September \r\nmeeting that there exists no reason — scientific nor \r\npolitical — for delaying an immediate response to this \r\nglobal crisis. \r\n Barbados and other members of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity have taken steps, at the national and \r\nregional levels, to develop and implement climate \r\nchange mitigation and adaptation strategies and plans, \r\nlargely from our own resources. However, the most \r\neffective unilateral adaptation strategies will be futile \r\nin the absence of decisive global action to reduce \r\nharmful greenhouse gases emissions and to address \r\nclimate change in a comprehensive manner. Our \r\nleaders have underscored the imperative of collective \r\naction to address climate change, with the United \r\nNations at the centre of the search for lasting solutions \r\nto that problem. In December, our negotiators in Bali \r\nmust seize this moment in time. \r\n The international community has yet to complete \r\nthe Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, with \r\nan outcome that has development at its core. While \r\ntrade liberalization can assist in that process, much \r\nmore is required if sustainable economic development \r\nis to be achieved in the developing world. We firmly \r\nbelieve in a multilateral process, which will not only \r\ncater to the aspirations of the more developed \r\ncountries, but will also address the needs of developing \r\ncountries, especially those with small, vulnerable \r\neconomies such as ours. I urge the international \r\ncommunity to proceed with the multilateral trade \r\nnegotiations with a view to reaching a successful and \r\nmutually beneficial outcome. \r\n Barbados and the other countries of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) are neither major \r\nsuppliers of nor demand markets for illicit drugs. Yet, \r\nbecause of our geographical position and external \r\nfactors that are largely beyond our control, we find \r\nourselves affected by the illicit trafficking in drugs, \r\nsmall arms and light weapons and their constant \r\ncompanion, transnational organized crime. As small \r\ncountries with limited resources and severe \r\nvulnerabilities, we depend on international cooperation \r\nto counter those threats. The presence of the Caribbean \r\nRegional Office of the United Nations Office on Drugs \r\nand Crime (UNODC) in Barbados, which served a total \r\nof 29 States and territories and provided significant \r\ntechnical assistance, was extremely important to the \r\nCaribbean region. \r\n We are deeply concerned about the decision taken \r\nunilaterally in Vienna to close that Office, and we are \r\nnot at all convinced that it will make our region safer \r\nfrom these very real threats. On the contrary, the \r\nstudies published earlier this year by the UNODC and \r\nthe World Bank, on drugs, crime and development in \r\nCentral America and the Caribbean, clearly \r\ndemonstrate the need for an enhanced international \r\neffort in the region. It is our sincere hope that this \r\nunfortunate decision will be reversed as a matter of \r\nurgency and that the United Nations will once again \r\nengage the Caribbean region, through the reopening of \r\nthe Regional Office in Barbados. \r\n The issue of reform of the Security Council has \r\nbeen under consideration by the General Assembly for \r\nseveral years. Member States have expressed their \r\nviews, and group positions have been formulated, but \r\nfirm decisions have eluded us. It is now time for \r\npolitical compromise in the negotiation of an \r\nacceptable solution. Barbados will continue to \r\nparticipate actively in this process. \r\n Gender equity and the empowerment of women \r\nare critical to development at both the national and \r\ninternational levels. There is a need to improve the way \r\nin which gender is treated within the context of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is crucial that the proposal to \r\nestablish a new gender architecture be further \r\ndiscussed at the intergovernmental level and that all \r\nconcerns be addressed and taken into consideration \r\nbefore a final decision is made. Any new structure \r\nmust give due prominence not only to normative and \r\nadvocacy issues, but also to issues of development, \r\noperational activities and adequate resources. \r\n The deepening of the regional integration process \r\nis critical to the ability of CARICOM countries to \r\nrespond to the challenges and opportunities presented \r\nby changes in the global community. Having \r\nestablished the Single Market in 2006, our efforts are \r\nnow focused on mechanisms to bring the Single \r\nEconomy into effect through a process of phased \r\nimplementation. The Single Economy will facilitate \r\nfurther integration of our production and financial \r\nsectors, the coordination of our economic sectoral \r\npolicies, the convergence of macroeconomic policies, \r\nthe building of a regional capital market and the \r\nharmonization of monetary and fiscal policies. \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 6 \r\n \r\n Functional cooperation has been a central theme \r\nof the Caribbean Community since its inception. We \r\nbelieve that, as small nations with so much in common, \r\nour best means of advancement lies in sharing our \r\nresources, experience and expertise to address mutual \r\nconcerns. Health, education and, more recently, \r\nsecurity are our foremost areas of resource pooling and \r\nresearch. Our region has the distinction of being one of \r\nthe first to have eradicated polio and smallpox. A \r\nfortnight ago, the region convened its first summit to \r\nspecifically address chronic non-communicable \r\ndiseases, which have become the major causes of \r\nmorbidity and mortality. \r\n A stable, peaceful and prosperous Haiti is \r\nessential for the effective functioning of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity to which it belongs. There is a continuing \r\nurgent need for substantial support from the \r\ninternational community to assist Haiti in consolidating \r\nand strengthening the commendable progress that it has \r\nmade to date. A prime requirement is the further \r\nextension by the Security Council of the mandate of \r\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti to \r\ninclude a focus on peacebuilding, judicial reform, \r\ninstitutional support for the provision of basic services, \r\nand border management. We must directly address the \r\nhumanitarian and socio-economic needs of Haiti if the \r\nmajority of the population is to be lifted out of poverty \r\nand if the underlying preconditions for threats to peace \r\nand security in the country are to be removed. \r\n This year, many countries around the world, \r\nincluding Barbados, commemorated the two-hundredth \r\nanniversary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave \r\ntrade. The horrors of the slave trade — particularly the \r\nnotorious middle passage — were of such huge scale \r\nand intensity that it can truly be considered one of the \r\nearliest crimes against humanity. That experience must \r\nnever be repeated. \r\n To bring closure to the criminal activity that was \r\nracial slavery, we also need to bring equity to the \r\nemancipation process. Addressing the controversial \r\nissue of reparations is essential to the attainment of \r\nthose objectives. This is not the first time that a \r\ndiscussion on reparations has taken place and that \r\ndecisions have been made. During the nineteenth \r\ncentury, Europeans accepted and enforced multiple \r\nforms of reparations. \r\n Delivering the Wilberforce Lecture in the United \r\nKingdom earlier this year, Prime Minister Arthur \r\nproposed the establishment of a William Wilberforce \r\neducational fund. Barbados encourages all those \r\ncountries that participated in and benefited from this \r\niniquitous practice to support that important initiative. \r\nIn so doing, they will be paying tribute to the courage \r\nand the moral convictions of all those who campaigned \r\ntirelessly for the end of the slave trade and of slavery, \r\nand at the same time they will be supporting the \r\ncontinuous evolutionary experiment in human relations \r\nrepresented by the ethnic pluralism of Caribbean \r\nsocieties. \r\n In international affairs, a multilateral approach is \r\nthe best means for countries to fully and effectively \r\naddress the world’s most pressing problems. It is our \r\ncollective responsibility to make sure that this \r\nOrganization, the epicentre of multilateralism, is \r\nreformed and revitalized to make it more accountable — \r\na transparent and effective instrument in the service of \r\nthe development efforts of all its Members. \r\n Development is the key to sustainable \r\ninternational peace and security. In our quest to \r\nguarantee the primacy of development on the global \r\nagenda, we must make certain that the United Nations \r\nis sufficiently well funded to meet the needs of the \r\npoorest and most vulnerable among us, to support the \r\naspirations of middle-income developing countries and \r\nto facilitate the transition to developed-country status \r\nof those who are poised to make that transition. The \r\ndisproportionate allocation of regular budget resources \r\naway from the development agenda must be reversed \r\nwithout further delay. \r\n There can no longer be a deficit in the world’s \r\ndevelopment performance. We must all demonstrate the \r\npolitical will necessary to ensure that. It is a task from \r\nwhich we are not at liberty to abstain. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency  \r\nMr. Vartan Oskanian, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Armenia. \r\n Mr. Oskanian (Armenia): Each opportunity to \r\nspeak from this rostrum is a humbling experience, \r\nbecause I know that all the countries of the world listen \r\nto one another and try to discern and understand where \r\nour common approaches and interests lie. Those of us \r\nwho represent small countries have a sense that this \r\nforum is a place where large nations address the ills of \r\nthe world and that we smaller ones ought to stick to \r\nissues and topics that are specific to us and to our \r\nregions, as if addressing overarching, global issues \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n7 07-52646 \r\n \r\nwere pretentious and best left to those with the power \r\nto do something about them. \r\n Today marks my tenth year here, and I risk \r\nbreaking the rule. This year, as financial calamities \r\nhave compounded political and natural disasters, it has \r\nbecome very clear that, although our common \r\nproblems and challenges threaten us all equally, they \r\naffect us unevenly. The small nations, which have less \r\nof everything — diversity, resources, manoeuvrability, \r\nmeans and options — are at greater peril and have \r\ngreater susceptibility than those with bigger territories, \r\nlarger populations and greater potential. \r\n At the same time, the issues on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly — such as peace and security, \r\neconomic growth, sustainable development, human \r\nrights, disarmament, drugs, crime and international \r\nterrorism — know no borders, and none of us can \r\naddress them individually if we want to see effective \r\nsolutions. Finding solutions to these problems is in our \r\ncommon interest, for they are issues that affect all of \r\nhumanity. And because these problems cannot be \r\nsolved within our own borders, no one has either the \r\nright to abdicate responsibility for the consequences or \r\nthe luxury of doing so. \r\n When the speculative market drives the price of \r\noil to $80, those who are too small to have significant \r\nreserves are the ones who are affected most, and large \r\ncountries with large appetites for fuel sometimes make \r\ndeals on energy matters that are not consistent with \r\ntheir policies. So do we, because energy security is not \r\nonly a matter of global arithmetic; it is also a matter of \r\nlife and death. \r\n When climate change causes serious changes in \r\nthe environment, it does not take much for a prolonged \r\ndrought or an excessive rain to harm our agriculture \r\nand damage our economy or for rising sea levels to \r\nreach our cities. But we do not have the space or the \r\ndiversity to cope and adapt. \r\n When it is news that there have been no \r\nexplosions in Iraq and when daily calamities are \r\ncommonplace, we in the small countries begin to sense \r\nthat we are vulnerable and susceptible to the will and \r\nthe capacity of other members of the international \r\ncommunity and, most important, to their tolerance of \r\ndistant acts of violence and humiliation. \r\n When development is dependent on the absence \r\nof bad weather, disease and war, and when the capacity \r\nto ward off at least two of those three ills lies in the \r\nhands of those who have the ability to bring peace and \r\nto heal, we in the small nations feel at risk and \r\nhelpless.  \r\n When disarmament and arms control cease to be \r\ninstruments for peace and security and instead become \r\na means to reap political dividends, we in the small \r\ncountries turn to our own means for self-protection. In \r\nother words, we become part of the problem, because \r\nthe solution is not straightforward or visible.  \r\n Finally, when “Darfur” becomes shorthand for \r\n“helplessness”, we in the small nations of the world \r\nrealize that power has replaced responsibility. The \r\nubiquitous language of human rights cannot and will \r\nnot compensate for a lack of political will to act. \r\nGenocide must be prevented, not commemorated.  \r\n Generation after generation, we find new places \r\nfor appalling human tolerance of inhuman \r\nmachinations and names for places of slaughter, mass \r\nkillings and massacres of those who belong to a \r\nparticular sector, ethnic group, race or religion. For \r\nArmenia, it was, for 100 years, the desert of Der el \r\nZor; for the next generation, it was Auschwitz; later, it \r\nwas the killing fields of Cambodia; and, more recently, \r\nit was Rwanda. If each one of those names, together \r\nwith the word “genocide”, evokes ignorance, \r\nhelplessness and the covering up of war crimes, \r\n“Darfur” today is synonymous with expediency, \r\nevasion and simple inconvenience. “Darfur” is \r\nsynonymous with shame. \r\n My appeal to the international community, on \r\nbehalf of the small countries, is that it address each of \r\nthese issues on its own merits and for its own sake, not \r\nas a piece of the global power puzzle. When tension \r\nrises between global Powers, it leads to polarization, \r\nand that in turn leads to a decrease in the capacity of \r\nsmall nations to carry out hard-earned policies of \r\ncomplementarity and balance. Our ability to be part of \r\nthe process diminishes. \r\n Let me state the obvious: we count on the \r\nwillingness of the great Powers in the international \r\ncommunity to set aside their disputes and to try to \r\naddress these issues collectively. We also expect that \r\nthey clearly understand that their power and influence \r\ndo not make them immune from the consequences of \r\nthe processes and problems that afflict us. \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 8 \r\n \r\n Last month, Armenia celebrated its sixteenth year \r\nof independence. During this period, we have \r\nweathered sea changes that have swept us up in \r\nregional and global processes that affect us in our daily \r\nlives. But we can only take pride in what we have \r\naccomplished during the same period: an open and \r\ndiverse economy, high growth and strong financial \r\nsystems, as well as improved elections, stronger public \r\ninstitutions and a population that is increasingly aware \r\nof its rights. All of that gives us the confidence and \r\ndetermination to address other ills facing our society — \r\nuneven growth, a high poverty rate, low pay — and to \r\nstrengthen our human institutions and deepen our \r\nexperience with democracy.  \r\n We have accomplished all of this under difficult \r\ncircumstances. We still have a conflict to resolve with a \r\nneighbour; there are artificial limitations on Armenia’s \r\nability to act; and regional cooperation is lacking.  \r\n The agenda of the General Assembly this year \r\nincludes an item on protracted conflicts. Lumping all \r\nthose conflicts together is an inherently flawed \r\napproach. Our own conflict in Nagorny Karabakh does \r\nnot belong there. The United Nations is not the place to \r\naddress it, because that issue is being addressed within \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope. Additionally, Karabakh is not a frozen conflict. \r\nWe are negotiating with Azerbaijan and are inching \r\ntowards a resolution.  \r\n Second, during this time, there has been an \r\nevolution of the process. We have a balanced, solid \r\ndocument in our hands that addresses not only the core \r\nissues but also consequential issues, and the two \r\ntogether add up to a reasonable solution. \r\n Third, at the core of our process lies the right of \r\npeoples to self-determination. Indeed, the people of \r\nKarabakh do not want anything more than that which is \r\ntheirs. They want to live in peace and security on their \r\nown territory. In other words, they would like to \r\nexercise the very right that every single nation in this \r\nHall has exercised at some time in their history.  \r\n Speaking of conflict, we also follow very closely \r\nthe events in Kosovo. We hear the international \r\ncommunity loud and clear when it is said that Kosovo \r\nwill not be a precedent for other conflicts. We are not \r\nattempting to make Kosovo a precedent for our \r\nconflict, because that contradicts our own principle that \r\nall conflicts are different. At the same time, however, \r\nwe will not accept or understand the reverse logic, \r\nwhich holds that because Kosovo has been given \r\nindependence, other peoples cannot achieve \r\nself-determination. No one should tell us that there is a \r\nquota for liberty and freedom. \r\n At the end of the day, the willingness and \r\nunderstanding of small nations and their involvement \r\nin global processes cannot be a substitute for what \r\nmajor Powers with greater capacities and political will \r\nto act can do. In this age of openness and inclusion, \r\nthere is no room for the old instruments of coercion \r\nand exclusion. Instead, we need new instruments of \r\ncompromise and consensus so that we can achieve \r\nhumanity’s enduring goal of living in peace and \r\nprosperity. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Seyoum Mesfin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. \r\n Mr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): Allow me to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. I would like to assure you of my \r\ncountry’s fullest cooperation in the discharge of the \r\nresponsibilities bestowed upon you. I have no doubt \r\nthat this Assembly will benefit from both your personal \r\nand professional experience. May I take this \r\nopportunity to commend your predecessor, Ambassador \r\nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her invaluable \r\ncontributions and wise leadership during the \r\nAssembly’s previous session. \r\n I would also like to extend my sincere \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. He is \r\nalready fully engaged and has made an excellent \r\nbeginning in the efforts to address global challenges \r\nsince he took office a year ago. I would therefore, on \r\nthis occasion, like to underline Ethiopia’s firm \r\ncommitment to cooperate in every way in assisting him \r\nin his demanding endeavours. \r\n Just three weeks ago, Ethiopia began its third \r\nMillennium. This Assembly has recognized the \r\nEthiopian Millennium as a world event. On 15 June \r\n2007, it adopted resolution 61/270, designating the \r\nyear from 12 September 2007 to 11 September 2008 as \r\nthe year of the Ethiopian Millennium. The Assembly of \r\nthe African Union also declared the Ethiopian \r\nMillennium as a part of African heritage and a unique \r\noccasion. We thank you all for that honour and for that \r\nexpression of solidarity. \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n9 07-52646 \r\n \r\n Those who have witnessed how Ethiopians of all \r\nwalks of life have received the new Ethiopian \r\nMillennium could not have missed the new spirit that \r\nhas been on display in the country. This is a spirit of \r\nrenewal and commitment to stand in unity for a better \r\nfuture for the country. The new Millennium was \r\ngreeted by all Ethiopians with a pledge to do more for \r\nnational harmony and for durable peace and stability \r\nand to prevail against the poverty that has been the \r\nhallmark of the country in recent decades. \r\n Two thousand years ago, Ethiopia was the home \r\nof one of the great civilizations of the world, at Aksum. \r\nA thousand years ago, we could still produce two of the \r\nworld’s greatest heritage sites. One is the city of Harar, \r\nthe fourth holiest city of Islam, which by happy \r\ncoincidence also celebrates its own millennium this \r\nyear. The other is the city of churches built by Lalibela, \r\na saint, priest and emperor in the town that still bears \r\nhis name today. \r\n But Ethiopia’s fortune began to change, \r\ncommencing in the second half of the last Millennium. \r\nThough a survivor of colonialism and a representative \r\nof the greatness of Africa’s past, Ethiopia also \r\nunfortunately came to represent and symbolize the \r\npoverty, dearth and destitution of Africa’s more recent \r\nhistory. \r\n Despite the formidable challenges we have faced, \r\nall of this has begun to change in the last decade. \r\nHopelessness and frustration growing out of a lack of \r\nconfidence in the future is no longer an image \r\nreflecting the reality of Ethiopia. That is perhaps the \r\nexplanation for the exuberance displayed by all sectors \r\nof Ethiopian society in welcoming the new \r\nMillennium. A new and strong national consensus is \r\nbeing created in Ethiopia today. It is a consensus \r\naround conviction and the resolve to make the opening \r\nof our third Millennium a symbol of Ethiopian \r\nrenaissance. \r\n That overwhelming optimism displayed by all \r\nEthiopians at the opening of the new Millennium rests \r\non a tangible foundation. The political, social and \r\neconomic realities in Ethiopia have been changing over \r\nthe past decade. We are making meaningful progress. \r\nIndeed, we have no shortage of detractors. These are \r\nnon-Ethiopians determined to scuttle the progress we \r\nare making in all areas. Their attempts include efforts \r\nto undermine national unity and to micromanage \r\nEthiopia’s internal affairs. We have seen this, including \r\nover the past few days.  \r\n Despite all this, however, we continue to make \r\nprogress. For five consecutive years now, our real \r\ngross domestic product growth rate has averaged over \r\n10 per cent. Our per capita income growth has \r\naveraged nearly 8 per cent for the last seven years. \r\n More tangible perhaps, in terms of the progress \r\nwe have been making to change the life situation of our \r\npeople, is the advance we have registered towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. We are \r\nset to attain universal primary health care by 2010. We \r\nare well on the way to achieving the goals set for \r\nreducing child and maternal mortality well prior to \r\n2015. We have made much progress in combating \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. We have \r\nmanaged to halt and stabilize the spread of HIV/AIDS \r\nand reduce the incidence of malaria. \r\n What we have been able to achieve in the area of \r\neducation has been quite remarkable as well. There is \r\nnow little doubt that we are on our way to achieving \r\nuniversal primary education by 2015. Primary school \r\nenrolment at present is 91.6 per cent. Sixteen years \r\nago, it stood at 19 per cent. We have also begun to \r\nensure that the education available will, in fact, be \r\nquality education. \r\n We have also committed ourselves to \r\nenvironmental sustainability in a tangible manner. Our \r\nNew Ethiopian Millennium celebrations and the \r\npreparations leading to them have underlined practical \r\nexpressions to this commitment. The slogan “Two \r\nTrees for 2000” has been enthusiastically taken up \r\nthroughout the country. Popular enthusiasm has led to \r\nthe acceleration of the process that began earlier, \r\nculminating, after just three or four months, in the \r\nopening of the New Millennium and the planting of \r\nclose to a billion trees. This is a process that will \r\ncontinue throughout the year and beyond. \r\n Nor are we oblivious to the spectre of global \r\nwarming and the threat of climate change. Africa is \r\nexceptionally vulnerable to the effects of climate \r\nchange: so many of us live on the margins that the \r\nsmallest difference in climate can mean the difference \r\nbetween sufficient food and famine, survival and death. \r\nIt is a global challenge that requires a global response.  \r\n However, the need for speedy economic \r\ndevelopment in countries such as Ethiopia, and in \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 10 \r\n \r\nAfrica as a whole, should not be compromised simply \r\nin order to reverse dangerous climatic situations for \r\nwhose creation we have no responsibility. It should, \r\nnonetheless, be possible, through effective \r\ninternational collaboration, to ensure that the \r\ndevelopmental process in countries such as Ethiopia is \r\nenvironmentally friendly.  \r\n In this regard, we welcome the proposal of Brazil \r\nfor a new United Nations conference on the \r\nenvironment and development to be held in 2012. We \r\nare also appreciative of the European Union’s (EU) \r\ncommitment to further cut its greenhouse gas \r\nemissions and to introduce more responsible and \r\nsustainable energy policies. We endorse the EU’s \r\nsupport for reforming the institutional framework of \r\nUnited Nations environmental activities. \r\n The economic and social progress Ethiopia has \r\nmade over the past decade has, no doubt, been \r\nunderpinned by the real and concrete advances we have \r\nmade in building democratic institutions and fostering \r\nthe rule of law. In this regard as well, we are entering \r\nour New Millennium with even greater and renewed \r\ncommitment to deepening the democratic process in \r\nEthiopia and strengthening a culture of tolerance and \r\nmutual understanding among our people. There is a \r\nnew spirit of tolerance, dialogue and inclusiveness and \r\nof commitment to peace among our people. \r\n The further democratization of the country and \r\nthe nurturing of the rule of law is a pledge that every \r\nEthiopian is making as we enter our New Millennium. \r\nThis commitment is rooted in the conviction that \r\ndurable peace in our country and the successful \r\nachievement of our objectives in the economic and \r\nsocial spheres can only be viable if we succeed in \r\nadvancing towards achieving the democratic \r\naspirations of our people. We urge those who wish to \r\nmeddle in our affairs to remember that they will be \r\nheld accountable for their action and that they should \r\ndesist from seeking to place a trojan horse in our \r\nsociety. \r\n It is that same spirit of the New Ethiopian \r\nMillennium that must guide our foreign policy. We \r\nhave, over the last decade and a half, worked in good \r\nfaith for peace in our region. We are more prepared \r\nnow than ever and, in the spirit of the New \r\nMillennium, to contribute our share to achieving peace \r\nand understanding among peoples and countries, most \r\nparticularly in our own subregion. \r\n We are indeed fully aware that the basis for the \r\nrenaissance of Ethiopia, to which we are committed in \r\nour New Millennium, cannot be limited to what we do \r\nin Ethiopia alone. To be true to the new spirit and to \r\nsucceed in the rejuvenation of Ethiopia, we feel we \r\nhave the obligation to stretch a hand of friendship to all \r\nof those, near and far, who see wisdom in a positive \r\nresponse to this gesture. We are well aware of the need \r\nfor a regional atmosphere conducive to the \r\nrejuvenation of our region and of ourselves. It is not \r\njust the absence of conflict and dispute, but the reality \r\nof peace and cooperation, which is, we know, an \r\nabsolute necessity. Without this we cannot achieve our \r\naims, whether in Ethiopia, our region, or in Africa. \r\n Allow me to express our profound appreciation to \r\nall those who have helped us make the progress we \r\nhave made over the past decade. There are those who \r\nhave been steadfast in their support for our endeavours \r\nand who have stood with us through thick and thin. We \r\nare indebted to them. Our obligation is to be true to the \r\nprinciples that underpin those expressions of solidarity. \r\n Ethiopia, a founding Member of the United \r\nNations, will continue to be devoted to multilateralism \r\nand the fullest cooperation with the United Nations. \r\nTherefore, as I conclude, I wish to reiterate, once \r\nagain, our readiness to cooperate fully, and without \r\nreserve, with our Secretary-General in all areas where \r\nour contribution is needed and to seek friendship with \r\nall nations in the spirit of our New Millennium. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Lam Akol Ajawin, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of the Sudan. \r\n Mr. Ajawin (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure at the outset to convey to all those \r\npresent the greetings and the best wishes of His \r\nExcellency Omar Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir, the \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Sudan, who, owing to \r\nunforeseen circumstances, could not take part in this \r\nimportant session. \r\n It also gives me great pleasure to congratulate the \r\nPresident for his election as President of the United \r\nNations General Assembly in its sixty-second session. I \r\nam confident that his rich experience and high \r\nprofessionalism will lead our deliberations to the \r\nexpected successful results. I would also like to seize \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n11 07-52646 \r\n \r\nthis opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor, \r\nSheika Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the commendable \r\nefforts she undertook during the previous session of the \r\nAssembly. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nwarmly congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his election \r\nto lead this Organization. We have no doubt that he \r\nwill contribute constructively to the revitalization of \r\nthe United Nations role, preserving its Charter and the \r\nservice it renders to Member States in a spirit of \r\nrespect and transparency and that he will enable the \r\nUnited Nations to confront the current challenges at \r\nthis critical juncture in the development of \r\ninternational relations, where the international \r\ncommunity is faced with huge fateful challenges in \r\nmany areas. \r\n Last year, our President announced to the \r\nAssembly from this rostrum (see A/61/PV.11) that \r\npeace in our country is no longer a dream, but rather it \r\nis a living reality and an irrevocable strategic objective. \r\nToday, I am honoured to tell members that since then, \r\nwe have resolutely continued to implement the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement and to make it a \r\nreality. \r\n All the constitutional institutions and organs \r\nnecessary for implementation of the Agreement have \r\nbeen established. At the level of executive institutions, \r\nthe presidency, the Government of National Unity, the \r\nGovernment of South Sudan and the state governments \r\nhave all been established. In addition, the legislative \r\ninstitutions at the national level, in South Sudan and at \r\nthe State level have been formed. At the judicial level, \r\nthe National Judicial Service Commission and the \r\nConstitutional Court have been set up. Furthermore, all \r\ncommissions provided for in the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement — such as the National Constitutional \r\nReview Commission, the Assessment and Evaluation \r\nCommission, the National Petroleum Commission, the \r\nNational Civil Service Commission, the Commission to \r\nProtect the Rights of Non-Muslims in the Capital and \r\nthe Technical Ad Hoc Border Committee — have been \r\nestablished and are all now diligently and \r\nconscientiously carrying out their mandates. \r\n Under the timeline for the implementation of the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement, the National \r\nElectoral Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCommission will be established by the end of this year. \r\nThe National Legislature will adopt relevant legislation \r\nfollowing the resumption of its session this month. A \r\nnumber of unresolved issues are currently being \r\ndiscussed and negotiated by joint committees \r\ncomprising representatives of the two partners and \r\nother members of the Government of National Unity. \r\nWe hope that those issues will be resolved soon, \r\nparticularly since both partners have declared their \r\ncommitment to that end. Moreover, it is important to \r\nemphasize that peace and security prevail today in \r\nSouth Sudan and the other areas covered by the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement. That fact in itself is \r\nthe greatest achievement of the Agreement, since it \r\nforms the necessary groundwork for the \r\nimplementation of other provisions. \r\n While my country reaffirms its full commitment \r\nto the letter and the spirit of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement and is determined to energetically and \r\nfaithfully pursue its implementation, we also expect the \r\ninternational community to honour its pledges in \r\nfulfilling the requirements for peace — in particular \r\nthe pledges made at the 2005 Oslo donor conference, \r\nthe cancellation of all external debt and the lifting of \r\nunilateral economic sanctions and restrictions, which \r\nhamper reconstruction and development efforts and, \r\nindeed, defeat the very objectives of the Agreement — \r\nso that the country can manage the burden of \r\nreconstruction and development. Peace and security are \r\ntwo sides of the same coin: neither can exist without \r\nthe other. Sudanese citizens are eagerly awaiting the \r\npeace dividends of reconstruction and development. \r\nWe must not fail to meet that legitimate expectation. \r\n The march towards peace resolutely continued \r\nwith the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement at \r\nAbuja in May 2006 under the generous auspices of the \r\nAfrican Union, which served as mediator. The \r\nAgreement was a huge step forward towards the \r\nachievement of peace, stability and development in \r\nDarfur through dialogue. That fact was acknowledged \r\nby the international community, which effectively \r\ncontributed to the conclusion of the Agreement.  \r\n We have begun to implement various aspects of \r\nthe Darfur Peace Agreement. In the area of \r\npower-sharing and participation, the Transitional \r\nDarfur Regional Authority has been established, and \r\ncitizens of Darfur have been appointed to executive \r\nlegislative positions at all levels of Government. All \r\nprovisions of the Agreement related to power- and \r\nwealth-sharing and to security arrangements — \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 12 \r\n \r\nparticularly the Ceasefire Commission — have also \r\nbeen put in place, in full cooperation with the partners. \r\n With regard to the humanitarian situation, my \r\ncountry has always been fully committed to facilitating \r\nunhindered access to the flow of relief assistance for \r\nthe affected and the needy. We have also facilitated the \r\nactivities and movement of humanitarian organizations \r\nin Darfur. All those efforts culminated in the Joint \r\nCommuniqué between the Government of the Sudan \r\nand the United Nations on Facilitation of Humanitarian \r\nActivities in Darfur, which we signed with the United \r\nNations on 28 March 2007. The Communiqué is \r\nbeing implemented through a joint mechanism \r\ncomprising the Government, the United Nations and \r\nnational and international voluntary non-governmental \r\norganizations. \r\n The humanitarian situation is clearly improving, \r\nas confirmed by health and humanitarian statistics \r\nshowing lower levels of epidemics, hunger and food \r\nshortages, a situation better than in other parts of that \r\narea of Darfur. The return of internally displaced \r\npersons and refugees to their villages is another sign of \r\nimprovement. The Secretary-General himself \r\nwitnessed such movement during his most recent visit \r\nto the Sudan. \r\n The joint efforts of the Government of the Sudan \r\nand the United Nations to maintain and consolidate \r\npeace have continued with the strengthening of the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) through \r\nthe light and heavy support packages adopted at the \r\nhigh-level meeting held in November 2006 in \r\nAddis Ababa, followed by the hybrid operation \r\nauthorized by the Security Council in its resolution \r\n1769 (2007). Our country has declared its full \r\ncompliance with the letter and the spirit of that \r\nresolution.  \r\n The progress that has been made on the political, \r\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping fronts could have been \r\nachieved only through dialogue led by the United \r\nNations and other international actors — for which we \r\nhad been calling for quite some time — not through the \r\nimposition of policies of pressure and coercion. Thus, \r\nit has been possible to arrive at an agreement \r\nacceptable to all parties. That has propelled the \r\nsituation in Darfur into a good phase, thanks to efforts \r\naimed at a peaceful settlement and the inclusion of \r\ngroups that did not endorse the Darfur Peace \r\nAgreement.  \r\n My country is firmly convinced that the problem \r\nof Darfur must be resolved in a political manner, \r\nthrough negotiations. Therefore, we believe that high \r\npriority should be accorded to a political negotiation \r\nprocess. We reiterated that belief at the aforementioned \r\nhigh-level consultations held at Addis Ababa. Here, I \r\nwish to reaffirm my Government’s full support for the \r\njoint African Union-United Nations initiative, led by \r\nSpecial Envoys Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim. \r\nIn addition, we reiterate that we are fully prepared to \r\nengage in the peace talks scheduled to begin in Libya \r\non 27 October 2007. \r\n From this rostrum, we call on all rebel \r\nmovements in Darfur to join in the march towards \r\npeace without delay and to immediately cease \r\nhostilities, in response to the repeated appeals of the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan. My Government has already \r\ndeclared a unilateral ceasefire, which will coincide \r\nwith the 27 October peace talks. We hope and expect \r\nthat the armed factions will reciprocate so that a \r\npermanent and verifiable ceasefire can be declared \r\nwhen the talks begin. Furthermore, we call on the \r\ninternational community to take firm measures against \r\nthose who obstruct or refuse to participate in the peace \r\ntalks. We also call upon those international actors who \r\nhave hosted a number of the leaders of those factions \r\nto demonstrate that they are credible by persuading \r\nthem to participate in the Libya talks. At the high-level \r\nconsultations held on 21 September in New York, it \r\nwas resolved that the talks would be final and \r\nconclusive. \r\n Reconstruction and development are major \r\nfactors for stability and for strengthening efforts \r\ntowards a political settlement. We must therefore \r\ndevote similar attention to the issues of development, \r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction, as stipulated in \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1769 (2007). We look \r\nforward to the international community finalizing its \r\ncurrent efforts towards holding an international \r\nconference on the reconstruction of Darfur; we hope it \r\nwill take place soon. \r\n In the twists and turns of the Darfur problem, my \r\ncountry has been the subject of unfair, hostile and \r\nill-intentioned campaigns from some international \r\nquarters that are bent on exploiting the crisis in Darfur \r\nto serve their well-known interests, agendas and \r\nschemes. This vicious campaign has targeted our \r\ncountry’s policies and political positions and seeks to \r\nexaggerate and distort the facts and to denigrate the \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n13 07-52646 \r\n \r\ncountry’s capabilities, its heritage and the values and \r\ntraditions of its people. The campaign also aims at \r\ndiverting attention from other regional and \r\ninternational crises. We hope that the international \r\ncommunity will shoulder its responsibilities in the \r\nservice of peace and stability in Darfur and seize the \r\ngolden opportunity that will be provided by the \r\nexpected peace talks in Libya. \r\n My country, which has reaffirmed its full \r\ncommitment to the objectives of peace and stability, \r\nculminating in concrete terms in the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement, will leave no stone unturned to \r\nspread peace, security and stability in Darfur. It will \r\nstrive to consolidate its positive and constructive \r\nengagement with the United Nations. Clearly, there is \r\nno person or group of persons more concerned, or more \r\ndetermined to stop the bloodshed and achieve peace \r\nand stability in Darfur, than the Government of the \r\nSudan. \r\n We live in a world of continuous challenges and \r\nrecurrent threats. There is no doubt that the \r\ninternational community is more than ever convinced \r\nthat the only way to confront these challenges and their \r\nconsequences is through collective efforts effectively \r\nand ably led by the United Nations. Such a role is \r\nreflected in the special attention the Organization has \r\nbegun to pay to the challenge of climate change, as \r\nreflected in the statements made by heads of State or \r\nGovernment during the recent high-level event on \r\nclimate change. Climate change and environmental \r\ndegradation are major causes of conflict in many \r\nAfrican countries, including my own, as noted in the \r\nrecent comprehensive report of the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme, which highlighted the \r\nserious challenges the world faces as a result of climate \r\nchange. \r\n We must therefore consolidate our efforts and \r\ncapacities in order to save our planet for present and \r\nfuture generations. We all recognize that climate \r\nchange should be confronted within the framework of \r\nthe requirements of sustainable development and its \r\nthree pillars: economic development, social \r\ndevelopment and environmental protection. Sudan \r\nsigned the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and ratified it in \r\nNovember 1993, thus committing itself to mutual \r\ncooperation with the global community to address the \r\nproblem of climate change. A global consensus on a \r\npost-2012 agreement must be reached at the thirteenth \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUNFCCC and the third session of the Meeting of the \r\nParties to the Kyoto Protocol, to be held in Bali in \r\nDecember 2007. A successful outcome would be based \r\non the Rio principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities and would take fully into account the \r\nneeds of the developing countries, especially the most \r\nvulnerable among them In this context, the Sudan \r\nbelieves that developed countries must meet their \r\ncommitments in the fields of development, \r\ncapacity-building and financial and technical assistance \r\nto developing countries and must take the initiative to \r\nconfront such problems in those countries. \r\n The current international economic conditions \r\nand the commercial and financial scenario constrain \r\ndevelopment in developing countries, especially the \r\nleast developed among them. This poses imminent \r\ndangers to the peoples of those countries, due to many \r\nfactors. The most important of them are: the paucity of \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA); the unfair \r\nterms of international trade, which place restrictions on \r\ndeveloping countries’ exports to international markets \r\nand impose unfair prices on their primary \r\ncommodities; heavy external debt; and the negative \r\neffects of the process of globalization. \r\n The Millennium Summit reaffirmed Africa’s \r\nspecial needs and made meeting them a priority. \r\nHence, the United Nations should take the lead in \r\nreaching that objective. In this regard, we hope that the \r\nposition of Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on \r\nAfrica will be strengthened and that the necessary \r\nresources will be allocated to that office to enable it to \r\nshoulder its responsibilities towards strengthening \r\nUnited Nations activities focused on Africa, in \r\nparticular those pertaining to the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the consolidation \r\nof international cooperation to support the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. \r\n The Sudan reiterates the importance of the \r\nMillennium Declaration and of reaching its goals, as \r\nwell as the importance of other items on the \r\ninternational development agenda, with special \r\nemphasis on the right of developing countries to \r\ndetermine their priorities without restrictions, \r\nconditions or predetermined obligations that impede \r\ntheir development efforts, as described in the \r\nAfrican-Caribbean-Pacific Summit that my country \r\nhosted last December. \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 14 \r\n \r\n In this respect, I would like to point out that my \r\ncountry has exerted tremendous efforts towards the \r\nrealization of these objectives and has made noticeable \r\nprogress in the difficult areas of poverty eradication, \r\neducation, health care, maternal and child welfare and \r\ncombating diseases. \r\n The concept of human rights continues to attract \r\nthe attention of the international community, not only \r\nbecause of the vital importance of the issue, but also \r\nbecause of attempts to deviate from the aim of \r\ndiscussing this issue with integrity and to exploit it in \r\norder to settle political scores. My country is of the \r\nview that a new approach based on dialogue and \r\ncooperation should be introduced when dealing with \r\nhuman rights, instead of naming and shaming, \r\ncondemnation and threats of sanctions. Moreover, \r\nselectivity and double standards should not influence \r\nthe consideration of human rights issues, especially at \r\nthe Human Rights Council, which completed its first \r\nyear with the adoption of an important document that \r\nlays the institutional foundation of the Council \r\nthrough, inter alia, ensuring the independence of \r\nrapporteurs in the fulfilment of their mandates and \r\nensuring that human rights are monitored with \r\nneutrality. With the adoption of that important \r\ndocument, the Council has truly started the process of \r\ncorrecting the failures and shameful practices of the \r\nformer Commission on Human Rights. \r\n In fulfilment of its political commitments, and \r\nconsistent with the attention it gives to all sectors of \r\nsociety, especially the most vulnerable ones, the Sudan \r\nwas among the first countries to sign the Convention \r\non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Women \r\nhave been the focus of Government plans and \r\nstrategies aiming at their advancement and \r\nempowerment in all fields, in compliance with the \r\nprovisions of the Transitional Constitution and the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement. These efforts were \r\ncrowned with the adoption of national strategies and \r\nplans pertaining to the advancement and empowerment \r\nof women in all fields. \r\n As indicated earlier in relation to the declared \r\nobjectives of the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, in the light of experience with the former \r\nCommission on Human Rights, any effort to reform \r\ninternational institutions will be futile without the \r\nreform of the United Nations itself; any United Nations \r\nreform will be incomplete without the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n While we commend the efforts exerted thus far in \r\ndeliberations pertaining to Security Council reform and \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly, it is \r\nimportant to intensify efforts further in order to \r\naccomplish the desired objectives and understandings \r\nin this area. The Sudan reiterates its commitment to the \r\nAfrican position, as provided for in the Ezulwini \r\nconsensus and confirmed by subsequent African \r\nsummit meetings. Africa is the only continent without \r\npermanent representation on the Security Council, \r\nalthough African issues constitute more than \r\n70 per cent of the Council’s agenda. \r\n The fact that the Palestinian question remains \r\nunresolved since the establishment of the United \r\nNations decades ago not only tarnishes the credibility \r\nof the Organization but also continues to pose a serious \r\nthreat to international peace and security. It is \r\nimperative to conclude a comprehensive, lasting and \r\njust settlement of this conflict, especially in the light of \r\ncontinued violent confrontations between the \r\nPalestinian people and the Israeli occupying forces. \r\n The international community should force Israel \r\nto comply with international resolutions and fulfil its \r\ncommitments, including those set out in the Road Map, \r\nand enable the Palestinian people to exercise its right \r\nto self-determination and to establish its own \r\nindependent State, with its capital in Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif. It is also imperative to reach a \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, \r\nbased on Israel’s withdrawal from all the land it \r\noccupied in 1967. In this context, and to ensure \r\nsustained security and peace for all the peoples in the \r\nregion, we wish to confirm the need to make the \r\nMiddle East, without any exceptions, a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone. \r\n Developments in Iraq have further aggravated the \r\ndeteriorating situation in the Middle East. The \r\nincreasing pace of violence in Iraq and the \r\ndeterioration of the security situation make it \r\nincumbent on all of us to cooperate and help the Iraqi \r\npeople in their predicament. This can be achieved only \r\nthrough respect for the free will of the Iraqi people, the \r\npreservation of Iraq’s unity and national sovereignty \r\nand setting a time frame for the exit of occupation \r\nforces from Iraq. \r\n My country has repeatedly condemned terrorism \r\nin all its forms and manifestations. The Sudan supports \r\nall relevant regional and international decisions and \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n15 07-52646 \r\n \r\nresolutions pertaining to terrorism and affirms its \r\ncooperation with the international community to \r\nimplement these decisions. However, in order to \r\neradicate terrorism, it is necessary to address its root \r\ncauses and implement the integrated strategies that \r\nhave been adopted. \r\n I wish to conclude by reiterating that, in order for \r\nthe United Nations to continue playing its role, we all \r\nhave a collective responsibility, one based on a solid \r\ndetermination to make this Organization a platform for \r\ncollective international efforts that would effectively \r\nand expeditiously address global challenges. We also \r\nneed to coordinate with regional organizations within \r\nthe framework of the United Nations Charter. \r\n We look forward, therefore, to working together \r\nto strengthen multilateral cooperation for the common \r\ngood, transcending narrow self-interest. My country, \r\nwhich this year celebrates the fifty-first anniversary of \r\nits joining the United Nations, hopes that this session’s \r\ndeliberations will represent a landmark in fulfilling \r\nthose goals. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Marco Haisiku, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Namibia. \r\n Mr. Haisiku (Namibia): Sir, allow me to \r\ncongratulate the President on his unanimous election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. We are confident that he will discharge the \r\nhigh responsibility of his office with the wisdom, skill \r\nand experience for which he is renowned. \r\n I also wish to commend Ambassador Sheikha \r\nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, who acquitted herself very \r\nwell in the management of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session. \r\n I equally wish to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor taking up challenging issues facing humanity with \r\ncourage and determination. \r\n The world needs a stronger United Nations and \r\neffective multilateralism that can help humanity to \r\nrespond in a timely and effective way to global \r\nchallenges. Namibia regards climate change as one of \r\nthe urgent challenges facing humanity today. There is \r\nan overwhelming body of scientific evidence that \r\npoints to the urgency and gravity of climate change. \r\nClimate change is a global issue with serious \r\nimplications for economic growth, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Climate change is a present-day reality that \r\nadversely affects the lives of many people. The \r\ninternational community has to live up to its \r\ncommitment to provide resources to developing \r\ncountries in order that they may adapt to the effects of \r\nclimate change. By the same token, compulsory targets \r\nmust be set for the reduction of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. \r\n Namibia is not happy with the rate at which \r\ninvestments are being made in the development of \r\nrenewable and clean energy sources. I call upon the \r\nprivate sector to join hands with Governments to \r\ndevelop and apply technologies that can mitigate \r\nclimate change. Sir, I assure you of Namibia’s \r\ncommitment to act in consort with other Member \r\nStates to solve this problem through the establishment \r\nof concrete and ambitious goals to be implemented \r\nover an agreed period. All countries have a \r\nresponsibility to act according to their common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective \r\ncapabilities. \r\n Namibia would like to see the process for the \r\nreform of the United Nations expedited. The \r\nimportance of a stronger and effective United Nations, \r\ncapable of delivering its mandate, cannot be \r\noveremphasized. This, among other things, would \r\ninvolve the revitalization and reaffirmation of the \r\nauthority of the General Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Namibia is pleased with the enhanced role of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. I believe that it is well \r\npositioned to shape the overall development agenda, to \r\ndeal effectively with economic and social issues and to \r\nmobilize international efforts for the protection of the \r\nenvironment. \r\n We believe that the Security Council should be \r\nmade more democratic and transparent in its \r\ncomposition and working methods. All Member States, \r\nboth big and small, should have a meaningful stake in \r\nit. Namibia appreciates the efforts of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session to move \r\nthe reform process forward. The Security Council has \r\ngreat significance for Africa, since a major part of its \r\nagenda currently concerns peace and security issues on \r\nthat continent. In 2006, for example, 42 out of a total \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 16 \r\n \r\nof 87 resolutions adopted by the Security Council dealt \r\nwith Africa. However, Africa has only three \r\nnon-permanent seats on the Council. \r\n I wish to reiterate Namibia’s strong support for \r\nthe common African position as contained in the \r\nEzulwini consensus and in the Sirte Declaration. The \r\nneed for Africa to be equitably represented in the \r\nCouncil, with all the privileges associated with \r\nmembership, remains a priority for us. The challenge in \r\nthe immediate future would therefore be to begin a \r\ngenuine intergovernmental negotiation process, based \r\non the principle of justice and fairness for all. \r\n The achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed \r\ncommitments stand central to global economic stability \r\nand prosperity. The highest priority should be our \r\ncollective commitment to sustainable socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment on a global scale. I therefore wish to \r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals Report 2007, which \r\nwe find very useful as a summary of what has been \r\nachieved so far. \r\n Namibia is concerned, however, that the results \r\nare slow and uneven. We wish to underline what is \r\nstated on page 4 of the report: “that the MDGs will be \r\nattained only if concerted additional action is taken \r\nimmediately and sustained until 2015”. All \r\nstakeholders need to fulfil, in their entirety, the \r\ncommitments they made in the Millennium Declaration \r\nand their subsequent pronouncements. It is, therefore, \r\nimportant that Governments and institutions in the \r\neconomically advanced countries offer genuine \r\npartnership by providing new and additional resources \r\ncommensurate with the commitments made in line with \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n Namibia is classified as a lower middle-income \r\ncountry. It ranks number 126 out of 177 countries on \r\nthe Human Development Index, as it still bears the \r\nlegacy of social and economic inequalities inherited \r\nfrom its colonial past. Inequality in the distribution of \r\nincome and assets in Namibia is among the highest in \r\nthe world. Nevertheless, Namibia has made progress in \r\nthe provision of health, education and other critical \r\nservices for the majority of the population, and we are \r\non course to meet a number of the MDGs. \r\n Indeed, we face severe difficulty in responding to \r\na combination of the devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic, \r\nhigh levels of food insecurity and poverty at the \r\nhousehold level. This situation is compounded by \r\ndeclining international aid to Namibia because of its \r\nclassification as a lower middle-income country. I once \r\nagain call upon the international community to increase \r\nits support to Namibia, including market access and \r\naccess to financial sources, in the form of targeted \r\nofficial development assistance, concessional loans and \r\ninvestment flows. \r\n Namibia applauds the Joint Communiqué agreed \r\nto by the United Nations Security Council and the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) Peace and Security Council as a \r\nstep in the right direction. There is a need for more \r\nstructured and formalized cooperation between the two \r\nbodies on issues of peace and security in Africa. Such \r\ncooperation should also include the areas of financing, \r\nlogistics, technology and training. \r\n The right of peoples to self-determination is a \r\nfundamental human right that is enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. It is sad that, seven \r\nyears into the twenty-first century, colonialism is still \r\nwith us, posing a serious challenge to this Organization \r\nand humanity at large. My delegation has raised its \r\nvoice repeatedly in this Assembly by calling for the \r\nrealization of the inalienable rights of the people of \r\nWestern Sahara to self-determination. The international \r\ncommunity has an obligation to assist the people of \r\nWestern Sahara in their quest for freedom and \r\nindependence. Namibia, therefore, calls for the \r\nimmediate and unconditional implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara, \r\nand all resolutions of the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, with the aim of holding a free and \r\nfair referendum in Western Sahara. \r\n Similarly, Namibia is deeply concerned about the \r\ncontinuous suffering of the people of Palestine under \r\nIsraeli occupation. We wish to reaffirm our full and \r\nunequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the \r\nPalestinian people to self-determination, including \r\ntheir right to return to their land. I reiterate our appeal \r\nto the parties to resume the peace process on the basis \r\nof international law and all the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions. To this end, the United Nations has a \r\nresponsibility to assist the process. \r\n My delegation reiterates its call for an \r\nunconditional end to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. We believe that the blockade is \r\nnot only against international law, but that it is also \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n17 07-52646 \r\n \r\npolitically unjustifiable and undemocratic. Its \r\nextraterritorial nature impedes free trade and economic \r\ndevelopment. We urge the Government of the United \r\nStates of America to heed the call of the international \r\ncommunity and to implement the resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly that call for an end to the blockade. \r\n Let us commit ourselves, once again, during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly, to address effectively \r\nthe challenges we face, to save humanity from \r\ncatastrophe and to make the earth a common place for \r\nall, where all will live in peace and security. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Lygia Kraag-Keteldijk, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Suriname. \r\n Mrs. Kraag-Keteldijk (Suriname): It is an \r\nhonour for me to address this gathering today, and on \r\nbehalf of the Government and people of the Republic \r\nof Suriname I extend my congratulations to President \r\nKerim for having been entrusted the task of leading the \r\nwork of the General Assembly during this sixty-second \r\nsession. We pledge our full support and cooperation as \r\nwe collectively continue our work on the many \r\nchallenges the world is faced with today. \r\n Allow me to salute your predecessor, Mrs. Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, for guiding the ongoing process of \r\nreform of the United Nations and for her dedication \r\nand commitment to the strengthening of \r\nmultilateralism. \r\n To the newly appointed Secretary-General of the \r\nOrganization, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, we \r\npledge our support in furthering the ideals of the \r\nCharter towards sustainable development, international \r\npeace and security and respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. \r\n The current international scene predominantly \r\nspeaks about the devastating effects of climate change, \r\nand also the recent findings of the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change have confirmed the warming \r\nof the climate system and have clearly linked it to \r\nhuman activities.  \r\n The effects of climate change will be felt in all \r\nparts of the world; however, the impact will be worse \r\nin small and vulnerable States. Suriname is a low-lying \r\ncoastal country, and the majority of the population is \r\nconcentrated in the coastal zone, where most economic \r\nactivities, including fisheries, agriculture and \r\nindustries, are located. A sea level rise would therefore \r\nbe catastrophic for our country. \r\n Taking into consideration the national interest in \r\nexploiting natural resources, it is imperative for a \r\ncountry to find a sound balance between economic \r\ndevelopment and preservation of the environment. \r\nTherefore, the Government has declared a substantial \r\npart of our land area as a nature-preserve area, \r\nincluding the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, which \r\nhas been designated as a World Heritage site by the \r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization (UNESCO). Since the majority of our \r\nland surface is covered by tropical rainforest, Suriname \r\ncontributes significantly to counterbalancing the effects \r\nof global warming.  \r\n A global threat, however, justifies global action, \r\nand the responsibility to provide an adequate answer \r\nlies with all of us. We call on the international \r\ncommunity and development partners to increase their \r\nefforts and to continue their technical and financial \r\nsupport to developing countries to safeguard the world \r\nenvironment for current and future generations.  \r\n The Government of Suriname remains committed \r\nto realizing by 2015 the targets set forth in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). This \r\ncommitment is expressed in our policy documents. Not \r\nonly do we accept the challenge to achieve the MDGs, \r\nbut also a commitment towards our people to realize \r\nsustainable economic and social development in every \r\npart of the country, including the remote areas in the \r\ninterior, which are populated mainly by indigenous \r\npeoples and maroons. \r\n The Republic of Suriname places great \r\nimportance on the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, including those of \r\nindigenous peoples. With the historic adoption of the \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \r\nrecently, Suriname has joined the international \r\ncommunity in giving recognition to the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples. I wish to note that in recognition \r\nof the status of indigenous peoples as natives, the \r\nRepublic of Suriname has recently declared 9 August, \r\nInternational Day of the World’s Indigenous People, as \r\na national holiday.  \r\n Surinamese society, which is multi-ethnic, \r\nmultilingual, multicultural and multireligious, attaches \r\ngreat importance to tolerance and mutual respect. I \r\ntherefore commend the High-Level Dialogue on \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 18 \r\n \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace, which will start tomorrow. \r\n I would like to recall that the slave trade and \r\nslavery were among the worst violations of human \r\nrights in human history, particularly given their scale \r\nand duration. We call on the international community \r\nto continue supporting the initiative of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity to honour the memory of all those who \r\nsuffered as a result of the slave trade and slavery. \r\n The United Nations is the supreme institution to \r\nadvance multilateral diplomacy. Suriname will \r\ncontinue to advocate for the strengthening and \r\nupdating of the multilateral system, in order to \r\nadequately address global issues in the areas of the \r\nenvironment, energy, water, peace and security.  \r\n Suriname adheres to the rules of international \r\nlaw. In this context the Government of Suriname \r\nrespects the award of the arbitral tribunal, which was \r\nconstituted to establish a maritime boundary between \r\nSuriname and Guyana, pursuant to Annex VII of the \r\n1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea. The award, which includes a finding of \r\njurisdiction to consider the parties’ maritime \r\ndelimitation claims, establishes a single maritime \r\nboundary between Guyana and Suriname that differs \r\nfrom the boundaries claimed by each of the parties. \r\nSuriname is pleased that the rules of international law \r\nhave brought an end to a longstanding dispute.  \r\n In closing, I reiterate my country’s commitment \r\nto achieving the objectives of the United Nations, \r\nupholding the Charter and the rules of international \r\nlaw, and contributing towards a genuine global \r\npartnership. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Elmar Mammadyarov, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): I would like to \r\nadd my voice to those of previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on the occasion of your \r\nelection to the noble post of President of the General \r\nAssembly. I am confident that you will carry forward \r\nthe able legacy left by your predecessor, Mrs. Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa. Our warm tribute also goes to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as he strives to \r\nreinvigorate our Organization. \r\n We all have the great belief that in the twenty-\r\nfirst century the United Nations will be a more \r\neffective Organization. The continued relevance of this \r\nOrganization will, to a large extent, depend on our \r\nability to attune it to our concerns and make it \r\nresponsive to our needs.  \r\n The United Nations must continue to serve the \r\ninterests of all its Members States, regardless of \r\nwhether they are big or small. Our approach to \r\nproblems that transcend national boundaries should be \r\nbased on a global consensus, while maintaining the key \r\nrole of the United Nations in the cooperative \r\nmanagement of these problems. We need to advance \r\nfurther and harmonize diverging views on the reform \r\nof the Security Council. The Council should be \r\ntransformed into a democratic and respectful organ, \r\nreflecting its universal character, corresponding to \r\npresent-day realities, and taking into consideration the \r\nneed for balanced geographic representation in its \r\nmembership. \r\n The reform package should strengthen the \r\nGeneral Assembly as the policy-making organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is only through reinforcement of the \r\nAssembly’s role and mandate that we can successfully \r\ntackle some of the most pressing issues facing \r\nhumanity, not least the process of globalization. \r\n This year, 2007, marks the fifteenth anniversary \r\nof Azerbaijan’s membership in the United Nations. I \r\nwill use this apt occasion both for reflecting on our \r\nexperience and for looking ahead. The development of \r\nour region is inextricably linked to energy security \r\nissues. We in Azerbaijan have been working for more \r\nthan 10 years on our energy security. When we started \r\nour energy projects, the development of oil and gas \r\nfields and construction of pipelines, we could not \r\nimagine that our energy resources would be so crucial \r\nin supporting the causes of free competition and free \r\nmarket. But it so happens that we are right on time and \r\nready to provide an important contribution to global \r\nenergy security. \r\n Our firm dedication to the policy of economic, \r\npolitical and social reform allowed us to improve our \r\neconomic performance significantly. Last year, we had \r\na 34 per cent growth in gross domestic product (GDP), \r\nand more than 35 per cent this year. In four years, the \r\nState budget increased more than fourfold. We \r\nmanaged to decrease unemployment and poverty \r\nsignificantly. A 36.8 per cent increase in the \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n19 07-52646 \r\n \r\npopulation’s income and savings in financial \r\ninstitutions is a direct indication of the improvement in \r\nlivelihood. \r\n Investments continue to play a catalytic role in \r\nthe overall development of the country. In 2007, the \r\nlevel of investments from all financial sources has \r\nreached a growth of 10.6 per cent. Most important, as \r\ncompared to previous years, the share of domestic \r\ninvestments currently accounts for a significant \r\nincrease of 50.8 per cent, and a large part of it goes to \r\nthe non-oil sector. These are very important steps \r\ntowards achieving our goal of a diversified economy. \r\n We believe that the sustainability of growth and \r\ndevelopment in Azerbaijan not only is ensured by the \r\navailability of natural resources but also attests to the \r\ncommitment and capacity of the Government to protect \r\nthe rights of investors and to implement its \r\ncommitments under various contracts in the \r\nmultibillion range. \r\n Transparency and efficiency in oil revenue \r\nmanagement constitutes an important part of the \r\nGovernment’s efforts to improve public service and \r\naccountability. Thus, it gives me great pleasure to \r\ninform delegates that the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan, \r\nwhich leads the implementation of the Extractive \r\nIndustries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Azerbaijan, \r\nwon the prestigious 2007 United Nations Public \r\nService Award in the category of improving \r\ntransparency, accountability and responsiveness in the \r\npublic service. We believe that this success shows the \r\nefficiency of our Initiative, and we invite United \r\nNations Member States to discuss the achievements \r\nmade under the EITI. We plan to introduce a draft \r\nresolution on this subject during the current session. \r\n Using our geographical location and unique \r\ntransportation possibilities, we are pioneering projects \r\non bridging Europe and Asia. Countries to the east of \r\nthe Caspian Sea have expressed a vivid interest in these \r\nprojects, and the role of Azerbaijan in regional affairs \r\nhas become more important and has been transformed \r\ninto a stabilization factor. \r\n By dint of its political and historical background, \r\nAzerbaijan became home to various cultures and \r\nreligions. Building on this rich experience, during its \r\nchairmanship of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference Ministerial Council, our country provided \r\nsubstantial input to enhancing dialogue and broadening \r\nmutual understanding among nations, cultures and \r\nreligions. We believe that by spreading knowledge \r\nabout Islam and its values, cultural dialogue between \r\nthe civilizations will contribute to mutual \r\nunderstanding and trust. In this regard, the framework \r\nof the Alliance of Civilizations provides a good \r\nopportunity for joint action and partnership. \r\n Azerbaijan currently holds the rotating \r\nchairmanship of the GUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, \r\nAzerbaijan and Moldova) group. Our priority is to \r\nespouse GUAM geopolitical and geo-economic \r\nadvantages, utilize its role as a natural corridor \r\nbridging Europe and Asia and promote the \r\ndevelopment of civil societies and the economic \r\ncooperation of GUAM Member States. \r\n At the same time, GUAM serves as an effective \r\ninstrument to increase the international community’s \r\nawareness about risks and challenges that its Member \r\nStates have been facing. In this regard, I would like \r\nrefer to agenda item 16 of the current session relating \r\nto the protracted conflicts in the territories of \r\nAzerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova. These conflicts \r\nhave almost the same origin, similarly-developed \r\nscenario and dangerous outcome. They all started from \r\nthe manifestation of aggressive separatism, were \r\naccompanied by ethnic cleansing against civilians and \r\nresulted in the violation of the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of these States. \r\n GUAM is firmly convinced that the settlement of \r\nthese protracted conflicts must be based on territorial \r\nintegrity within their internationally recognized \r\nborders. Together with GUAM colleagues, Azerbaijan \r\nwill defend this fundamental principle of international \r\nlaw, initiate formal discussions in the General \r\nAssembly and mobilize support of the United Nations \r\nMember States. \r\n The Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorny Karabakh \r\nconflict remains the most serious challenge to the \r\nsecurity of our region. As a result of the conflict, we \r\nare still facing the continued occupation by Armenia of \r\na significant part, almost 20 per cent, of the \r\ninternationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan. We \r\nare hosting approximately one million refugees and \r\ninternally displaced persons, who were notoriously \r\nethnically cleansed and brutally expelled from their \r\nhomes of origin in Armenia and in the occupied \r\nterritories of Azerbaijan. \r\n Azerbaijan’s position on conflict settlement is \r\nfully based on the norms and principles of international \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 20 \r\n \r\nlaw, plus four relevant resolutions of the United \r\nNations Security Council that provide for the \r\nrestoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nAzerbaijan and the establishment of vast opportunities \r\nfor the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of the \r\nNagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. \r\n Negotiations on conflict resolution, which since \r\n1992 have been carried out within the framework of \r\nthe OSCE Minsk Group, have so far not yielded any \r\nresults. The more time passes, the more difficult it is \r\nfor us to observe from our side of the line of contact \r\nthe attempts of the current Armenian leadership to \r\nconsolidate the results of the occupation of our \r\nterritories, their attempts to destroy everything \r\nassociated with the Azerbaijani legacy in these \r\nterritories and to carry out illegal activities thereon. \r\nThe United Nations shall not tolerate such action. From \r\nthis high podium, I would like to address the Armenian \r\nnation in order that they recognize that their policy of \r\nbreaching peace and stability in the region has very \r\ndangerous, counter-productive and disastrous \r\nimplications for the long-term perspective of \r\ndevelopment, above all, for Armenia. I am confident \r\nthat Azerbaijan will restore its sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. It is only a question of time. \r\n Finally, on this issue, I would like to express our \r\ngratitude to Member States for their unequivocal \r\nsupport extended in September 2006 to General \r\nAssembly resolution 60/285, entitled “The situation in \r\nthe occupied territories of Azerbaijan”. Although \r\nArmenia dissociated itself from the resolution after \r\njoining the consensus on it, we still believe that \r\nestablishing the proper conditions for the \r\nenvironmental operation may become a significant \r\nconfidence-building measure. \r\n As a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAzerbaijan attaches great importance to the efficient \r\nfunctioning of the Council. It is our common task and \r\nresponsibility to ensure that this institution lives up to \r\nthe expectations vested in it and becomes a truly \r\nobjective, vigorous and credible universal human rights \r\nbody. We are looking forward to finalizing the \r\ninstitution-building of the Council so that it becomes \r\nfully operational and devotes attention to the issues \r\ndirectly within its mandate. \r\n In the course of the last two years, the United \r\nNations has continued to represent a unique platform \r\nfor international standard-setting in the field of human \r\nrights by adopting two major documents — namely, the \r\nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearance and the \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \r\nUndoubtedly, adoption of those important instruments \r\nrepresents a significant step forward in a long \r\nhistorical process. Already a signatory to the first \r\nConvention, Azerbaijan is currently considering \r\nsigning the latter. \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Rosemary Banks, chairperson of the delegation of \r\nNew Zealand. \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): As we meet for the \r\nsixty-second session of the General Assembly, we look \r\nagain to the United Nations as the global forum to \r\naddress the challenges which affect us all. \r\n Climate change is serious and urgent, as many \r\nhave said in this Hall. We welcome that it has been the \r\ntheme of our general debate this year. The science is \r\nclear. Climate change is real and will impact on all \r\nparts of the world. To meet the global challenge of \r\nclimate change, there must be widespread and effective \r\ninternational action. It will be important to get all \r\neconomies onto low carbon pathways over time. \r\nMarket mechanisms will have a significant role to play. \r\nIndividual countries will face different challenges. \r\nDifferent national circumstances must be taken into \r\naccount. \r\n The United Nations climate change conference in \r\nBali in December will be a fresh opportunity to \r\nre-energize our efforts in addressing climate change. \r\nNew Zealand wants to see a Bali road map emerge in \r\nDecember to set us on the course for an effective future \r\nresponse. New Zealand welcomes the momentum that \r\nis being generated by other high-level meetings in the \r\nlead-up to Bali, including the recent Asia-Pacific \r\nEconomic Cooperation Leaders’ Declaration. \r\n Last week’s high-level event deserves special \r\nmention. We congratulate the Secretary-General for his \r\nefforts in cultivating the political goodwill that will be \r\nvital if we are to reach agreement in Bali.  \r\n Taking action as an international community also \r\nmeans taking action domestically. In recent weeks, \r\nNew Zealand has announced a number of domestic \r\nmeasures to address climate change. An emissions \r\ntrading scheme will be established from 1 January \r\n2008 and will form the cornerstone of our efforts to \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n21 07-52646 \r\n \r\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will, over time, \r\ncover all sectors and all gases. \r\n We have also identified a number of longer-term \r\ndomestic goals, which will move New Zealand down \r\nthe path to carbon neutrality. They will provide \r\nbenefits, including healthier homes, cleaner air and \r\nimproved public transport. While climate change is \r\ncertainly a challenge for us all, it is also an opportunity \r\nto move towards a more sustainable world. \r\n With regard to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, we recognize that having passed the halfway \r\npoint to 2015, the international community needs to \r\nstep up its efforts to achieve them. At the same time, \r\nthere is scope for the United Nations development \r\nsystem to be strengthened. We welcome the newly \r\nestablished initiatives in the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil — the Annual Ministerial Review and the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum — as practical ways \r\nto share information about what is working and where \r\nwe can improve our efforts at country level. \r\n New Zealand is also committed to improving \r\nsystem-wide coherence at the United Nations in the \r\nfields of development, humanitarian issues and the \r\nenvironment. We attach particular importance to \r\nworking for a strengthened, coherent, gender \r\narchitecture and towards effective gender \r\nmainstreaming across all United Nations entities. \r\n New Zealand welcomes the completion of the \r\nUnited Nations Pacific-based development agencies’ \r\nstrategic framework for the Pacific. We are keen to \r\nwork closely with United Nations agencies in the \r\nPacific to achieve positive outcomes for our partners in \r\nthe areas of human rights, sexual and reproductive \r\nheath, HIV/AIDS, child immunization and women’s \r\nleadership. \r\n A strong, prosperous and stable Pacific is a key \r\nforeign policy priority for New Zealand. We place a \r\nhigh priority on fostering solidarity and cooperation in \r\nthe Pacific to tackle the challenges the region faces in \r\ndemocracy, security and economic development. \r\nAround half of New Zealand’s development assistance \r\ngoes towards the Pacific.  \r\n New Zealand provides assistance in the region in \r\nTimor-Leste, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and \r\nBougainville in Papua New Guinea, with each situation \r\ncalling for a different response. \r\n The Timorese people, their leaders and the \r\ninternational community have all made a huge effort \r\nover the past year to return Timor-Leste to a more \r\nsecure and stable path. New Zealand has participated in \r\nthose efforts through our contributions to the \r\nInternational Security Forces and to the United Nations \r\nIntegrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT). Timor-\r\nLeste will require a sustained commitment from \r\nUNMIT.  \r\n The situation in Fiji continues to be of concern to \r\nNew Zealand. As a neighbour of Fiji with a long-\r\nstanding and very close relationship, New Zealand \r\nworked hard to avert last December’s coup, including \r\nby convening a meeting to mediate between the then \r\nPrime Minister and the military commander. We very \r\nmuch regret that this failed to dissuade the coup \r\nmakers from their illegal and unconstitutional path. \r\n New Zealand strongly and actively supports the \r\nsteps that have been taken by the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nto encourage an early return to constitutional \r\ngovernment in Fiji. We would welcome a firm \r\ncommitment from the interim administration to work \r\ntowards elections within the timeframe endorsed by the \r\nForum. Given that commitment, New Zealand would \r\nbegin to restore a more normal bilateral relationship \r\nthrough which we could cooperate in addressing Fiji’s \r\nundoubtedly complex problems. \r\n I also want to take this opportunity to address one \r\nissue in particular raised in the Solomon Islands \r\nstatement on Monday (see A/62/PV.13). It was \r\nsuggested, inter alia, that the presence of the Regional \r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), \r\nwas an “occupation”, and that RAMSI’s operation \r\ntransgressed Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. \r\nNew Zealand has always been committed to upholding \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter in every \r\nrespect. In our view, RAMSI is entirely consistent with \r\nthose purposes and principles. It is a specific example \r\nof Chapter VIII of the Charter in operation. To suggest \r\nit is contrary to the Charter is in our view wrong. \r\nRAMSI was established in response to a formal request \r\nfrom the Solomon Islands. Its presence in the Solomon \r\nIslands is sanctioned by treaty and by the domestic law \r\nof the Solomon Islands. That was recently reaffirmed \r\nby the Solomon Islands Parliament. Moreover, RAMSI \r\nstems from the endorsement by Pacific Islands Forum \r\nForeign Ministers of a programme of action under the \r\nForum Leaders’ Biketawa Declaration. That provides a \r\nframework for regional responses in times of crisis or \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 22 \r\n \r\nwhen members request assistance — exactly the \r\nsituation in this case. \r\n Amid all these challenges, I would like to report \r\non activity being undertaken by Tokelau, the tiny \r\nterritory 500 kilometres north of Samoa that New \r\nZealand administers. The people of Tokelau, all 1,500 \r\nof them on three atolls, have decided that they wish to \r\nundertake an act of self-determination to decide \r\nwhether they wish to change their present status. A \r\nvote in February 2006 narrowly missed the threshold \r\nset by Tokelau for a change of status. They will again \r\nvote on that issue from 20 to 24 October. \r\n As members of the Special Committee on \r\nDecolonization know, New Zealand supports Tokelau’s \r\nright to choose, but has stood back from any wish to \r\ndetermine the direction of any change. That decision is \r\nentirely for the people of Tokelau. New Zealand will \r\nsupport their decision. \r\n Advancement of the rule of law at the national \r\nand international levels is essential for the realization \r\nof sustained economic growth, development and \r\nhuman rights. New Zealand encourages members to \r\nprovide their full support to the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) by acceding to the Rome Statute of the \r\nICC. We also call on all United Nations Member \r\nStates, especially State parties to the Rome Stature, to \r\nfully cooperate with the Court in carrying out its \r\ncurrent work. Universality and full support are crucial \r\nif we are to end the impunity of the perpetrators of the \r\nmost serious crimes of international concern, such as \r\nthose carried out in Darfur, where International \r\nCriminal Court arrest warrants are outstanding. \r\n Efforts to protect and maintain the international \r\nrule of law can only be effective when built on a \r\nfoundation of international peace and security. \r\n Interfaith and intercultural dialogue can help to \r\ncounter religious extremism by encouraging \r\nunderstanding and respect among different faith \r\ncommunities and cultures. \r\n In May, New Zealand hosted two significant \r\ngatherings aimed at advancing global response to \r\ninterfaith and intercultural issues in a practical way. We \r\nregard the United Nations’ Alliance of Civilizations as \r\nthe key multilateral process among the growing \r\nnumber of international and regional initiatives in this \r\narea. \r\n With respect to nuclear proliferation, New \r\nZealand welcomes the strong signals that have been \r\nsent to North Korea and Iran by the Security Council. \r\n On a different topic, New Zealand is convinced \r\nthat the humanitarian harm posed by cluster munitions \r\nmust be addressed urgently. We believe that negotiation \r\nof a treaty to deal with the problems caused by cluster \r\nmines is well overdue. We will host a meeting on this \r\ninitiative in February of next year. \r\n We are pleased, too, to promote a new initiative \r\nat the General Assembly this year calling for action to \r\nlower the operational status of nuclear weapons. \r\nMaintaining nuclear weapons at a high level of \r\nreadiness increases the likelihood of these weapons \r\nbeing used, with catastrophic consequences. \r\n The humanitarian disaster and conflict in Darfur \r\nthreaten security in the entire East African region. New \r\nZealand applauds the efforts by Members to establish \r\nthe new African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur. \r\n New Zealand is deeply concerned at the current \r\npolitical, economic and humanitarian situation in \r\nZimbabwe. We welcome the efforts being made to find \r\nacceptable solutions to the problems Zimbabwe faces. \r\nWe sincerely hope that these efforts continue and that \r\nsolutions can be found that will benefit all \r\nZimbabweans and will enable free and fair elections to \r\nbe held. \r\n New Zealand remains profoundly concerned at \r\nthe situation in Myanmar. Protestors have been killed, \r\nshot at, beaten and arrested. This violent treatment is \r\nreprehensible. Engaging in peaceful protests is a \r\nfundamental human right. New Zealand, therefore, \r\njoins others in calling for the immediate release of \r\nthose detained in recent weeks, along with the many \r\npolitical prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, who \r\nhave been held without trial for much longer periods. \r\n The Myanmar regime should be held responsible \r\nfor the personal safety and treatment of all the people it \r\nhas detained. We call on the authorities there to stop \r\nthe violence and to encourage a process of genuine \r\ndialogue with pro-democracy leaders and ethnic \r\nminorities. \r\n New Zealand fully supports United Nations \r\nefforts to resolve the immediate and longer term \r\nsituation in Myanmar. We welcomed the visit to \r\nMyanmar of Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari. We fully \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n23 07-52646 \r\n \r\nsupport continued discussion of the situation of \r\nMyanmar in the Security Council with a view to \r\nconsidering what further steps might be taken by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Turning now to human rights, New Zealand will \r\nstand for election to the Human Rights Council for \r\n2009 to 2012. We want to do our part to help this \r\nfledging United Nations organization achieve its full \r\npotential as the pre-eminent global human rights body. \r\n A human rights issue of particular importance to \r\nNew Zealand is the death penalty. Adoption of a \r\nresolution on a global moratorium on this inhumane \r\nform of punishment would represent a historic step \r\ntowards global efforts to abolish the death penalty. \r\n In closing, New Zealand has been a committed \r\nand active participant in the United Nations since its \r\nformation. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called \r\non Member States to deliver to the best of our abilities \r\nat the United Nations, recognizing the need for faster, \r\nmore effective action, as well as for a more results-\r\ndriven Organization that strives to have the highest \r\nstandards of transparency and professional ethics. New \r\nZealand whole-heartedly agrees.  \r\n We look forward to working closely with the \r\nSecretary-General, with you, Mr. President and with \r\nother Member States in all of our efforts to build a \r\nstronger United Nations for a better world. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency  \r\nMr. Sirodjidin Aslov, chairperson of the delegation of \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan. \r\n Mr. Aslov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): First \r\nof all, I would like to join in the sincere \r\ncongratulations on your election as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session and wish \r\nyou every success in this lofty office. I would also like \r\nto avail myself to this opportunity to express gratitude \r\nto your predecessor, Her Excellency Mrs. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa, for her selfless and efficient work during \r\nthe sixty-first session. We also join in the words of \r\nwelcome addressed to the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\n Tajikistan welcomes the continued reforms of the \r\nUnited Nations structure and enhancement of its \r\nactivities aimed at strengthening peace and \r\ninternational security, furthering the promotion of \r\nhuman rights, expanding its humanitarian mission, \r\nplacing the problem of climate change as an issue of \r\ntop priority and addressing today’s other challenges. \r\nWe believe that further progress in dealing with these \r\nissues of global importance is dependent on joint, \r\nconcerted and consistent actions of the entire \r\ninternational community. \r\n Tajikistan attaches primary importance to the \r\nfurther strengthening of the disarmament process, the \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the speedy entry \r\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty and activation of negotiations on the \r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. In \r\ncooperation with other Central Asian States, Tajikistan \r\ntook a very active part in the drafting of the Treaty on a \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone in Central Asia, which was \r\nsigned on 8 September 2006 in Semipalatinsk, and in \r\nthe adoption of the relevant General Assembly \r\nresolution (A/Res/61/88) last year. \r\n It is common knowledge that international \r\nterrorism, transnational organized crime and illicit drug \r\ntrafficking have become a serious obstacle on the road \r\ntowards sustainable development, inflicting much \r\nsuffering and causing trouble to humanity. The \r\ninternational community should intensify its efforts \r\naimed at counteracting the commission of acts of terror \r\nand the proliferation of ideologies based on terrorism, \r\nextremism and separatism, interreligious and \r\ninter-ethnic intolerance and hostility, and should \r\nenhance its struggle against the financing of terrorism. \r\n The global system of combating terrorism, which \r\nis currently taking shape, cannot be established without \r\nthe involvement of regional and subregional \r\norganizations. In our region, the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States, the Collective Security Treaty \r\nOrganization and the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization are serving this purpose. \r\n We believe that long-term success in combating \r\nterrorism and religious extremism depends on \r\neliminating the root causes of these negative \r\nphenomena associated with social and economic \r\nproblems within society. It is essential to jointly search \r\nfor ways of addressing poverty issues, overcoming \r\nnegative consequences of globalization, and resolving \r\ninternal and regional conflicts. Actions based on force \r\nalone will not be able to uproot terrorism. \r\n Regrettably, today, we witness the merging of \r\nterrorism with transnational organized crime and the \r\ndrug trade, which gives rise to our shared and \r\njustifiable concern. Prevention of illicit drug \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 24 \r\n \r\ntrafficking, which, to a certain extent, is the breeding \r\nground for terrorism and international crime, should \r\nbecome part and parcel of our common struggle against \r\nterrorism. In this regard, I would like to reiterate \r\nTajikistan’s willingness to continue constructive \r\ndialogue and cooperation with the aim of establishing \r\nan effective global partnership for counteracting the \r\nnarcotics threat. \r\n An international conference dedicated to the tenth \r\nanniversary of the signing of the General Agreement on \r\nthe Establishment of Peace and National Accord in \r\nTajikistan was held in Dushanbe in June 2007, in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations. Almost \r\nsimultaneously, the United Nations Tajikistan Office of \r\nPeacebuilding successfully concluded its activities. \r\nMoreover, for the first time, the citizens of my country \r\njoined international United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. These events provide convincing proof that \r\nthe United Nations has the capacity to assist in \r\nreaching a peace and in ensuring further sustainable \r\ndevelopment in a country that has lived through serious \r\ninternal conflict. \r\n For Tajikistan, like for most United Nations \r\nMember States, the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment is a high priority goal. Within the United \r\nNations framework, much has been accomplished the \r\nworld over in order to promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment and to alleviate poverty, epidemics, \r\nfamine and illiteracy. Meanwhile, the implementation \r\nof a large-scale programme on the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) will require \r\nnot only extra effort but also additional resources. \r\nTajikistan’s intention is to realize the greatest possible \r\nprogress in the implementation of the MDGs. The main \r\npurpose of the National Strategy for Development of \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan up to the year 2015 and the \r\nStrategy for Poverty Reduction in Tajikistan for the \r\nyears 2007-2009 is to ensure stable economic \r\ndevelopment and to provide a better standard of living \r\nfor the country’s population. \r\n It is also obvious that the attainment of the \r\nMDGs, to a large extent, also depends on the attitude \r\nof the international community when it comes to \r\nrendering assistance to developing countries and on the \r\ntimely mobilization of internal and external resources. \r\nWith this in mind, Tajikistan joins the appeal addressed \r\nto the donor community to at least double the amount \r\nof assistance targeted for development. The proposal to \r\npardon the debts incurred by developing countries in \r\nexchange for the implementation of national projects \r\naimed at sustainable development remains equally \r\nimportant. In this connection, we attach much \r\nsignificance to the unification of efforts aimed at \r\nsupporting sustainable financing for development, first \r\nand foremost, in the interests of attaining the MDGs. \r\nWe are in favour of a joint search for effective and \r\nfeasible development financing mechanisms. Partial \r\nwriting off of debts could be equally important, since it \r\nwould make it possible to invest liberated funds into \r\neducation, environmental protection, combating \r\nHIV/AIDS and other MDGs. \r\n Tajikistan wholeheartedly supports the creation of \r\na mechanism of additional measures aimed at making \r\nfurther progress in the realization of the right to \r\ndevelopment, as enshrined in the Declaration on the \r\nRight to Development. Among the issues that should be \r\nregarded as associated with that right are the rational \r\nusage of natural resources for the purpose of \r\ndevelopment, provision for the well-being of the \r\npopulation and addressing the problems of poverty and \r\nunemployment. \r\n In that connection, Tajikistan believes it has the \r\nright to develop the hydropower sector of the economy \r\nby building water reservoirs and dams on the major \r\nrivers of the country, because sustainable development, \r\nimproved living standards of the population, \r\nachievement of the MDGs, the provision of reliable \r\nregulated irrigation water flows and an increased \r\nproduction of electrical energy depend on the \r\navailability of hydropower resources. Not only is the \r\nimplementation of hydropower projects in Tajikistan \r\nextremely advantageous for the country itself, but it \r\nwill also be able to influence favourably the \r\nsustainable development of the other States of the \r\nregion. For instance, the completion of the construction \r\nof the Ragun hydropower station in Tajikistan alone \r\nwill make it possible to supply an extra three million \r\nhectares of land with water in the neighbouring Central \r\nAsian states. Only an integrated approach towards the \r\nuse of hydropower and other natural resources of the \r\nregion, based on the principles of mutual \r\nunderstanding, assistance and trust among the States of \r\nthe region, can ensure sustainable development in the \r\nregion and promote a resolution of environmental \r\nproblems, which are closely interconnected with the \r\nrational use of those resources. \r\n Tajikistan is interested in getting support and \r\nestablishing a partnership with countries and \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n25 07-52646 \r\n \r\ninternational organizations in the field of renewable \r\nsources of energy and energy-efficient technologies, \r\nwhich help to reduce the usage of other traditional \r\ntypes of energy that negatively affect our climate and \r\ndo enormous damage to the environment and to the \r\nfuture of humanity. \r\n Tajikistan welcomes the High-Level Event on \r\nClimate Change held recently in New York and the \r\nforthcoming conference on the same subject to be held \r\nin Bali in December 2007. \r\n Within the context of global warming, \r\ndegradation of glaciers and the snow cover on the \r\nterritories of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which are the \r\nupper watershed zones of Central Asia’s rivers, has \r\nbecome an ever increasing concern for the Central \r\nAsian region. According to various sources, over the \r\nlast 10 years the area of glaciers in Tajikistan has \r\ndecreased by 30 to 35 per cent. Although supplying the \r\npopulation with drinking water is being discussed at \r\nthe top level, and the fact that numerous declarations \r\nand other international instruments have already been \r\nadopted on this issue, the situation remains urgent. The \r\nsolution of the problem requires further coordinated \r\nefforts on behalf of countries and international \r\norganizations. This problem is not only addressed in \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, but it is also \r\nranked among those challenges that the world \r\ncommunity encounters on a daily basis. \r\n For this reason, the implementation of the \r\nInternational Decade for Action “Water for Life”, \r\nproclaimed by the United Nations on the initiative of \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan, is regarded as even more \r\ntimely and appropriate. As part of the Decade, the \r\nGovernment of Tajikistan has planned an international \r\nconference for 2008 in Dushanbe on water-related \r\nnatural disasters, to be held in cooperation with United \r\nNations agencies and other international organizations. \r\nTajikistan hopes that all United Nations Member States \r\nwill participate actively in this conference. \r\n From time immemorial the water originating in \r\nTajikistan has quenched the thirst of all nations of \r\nCentral Asia and has irrigated the dry steppes of the \r\nregion. However, it is obvious that the region has \r\nalready been experiencing water-related difficulties \r\nthat can become more aggravated on a yearly basis. To \r\naddress this urgent problem, Tajikistan proposes to \r\nprovide the Central Asian States with environmentally \r\nsound freshwater from Lake Sarez, which is located at \r\na height of almost 3,300 metres above sea level and \r\nwhich could provide freshwater to half the population \r\nof Central Asia. The implementation of this initiative \r\nwould make it possible to eliminate the real threat of \r\nan overflow of Lake Sarez, which could affect millions \r\nof people who reside in the downstream areas in \r\nneighbouring countries. \r\n As for the development of trade and economic \r\ncooperation with other countries, the major challenge \r\nthat Tajikistan is facing in this area is lack of access to \r\nthe sea and other transportation and communication \r\ndifficulties. For this reason, Tajikistan is committed to \r\nthe decisions and recommendations outlined in the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action for transit transport \r\ncooperation, which addresses the special needs of \r\nlandlocked developing countries to efficiently use the \r\navailable transport infrastructure and to increase transit \r\ncapacity in order to encourage development of trade \r\nand the advancement of investments in Central Asia. \r\n The rehabilitation process in Afghanistan is \r\ncreating favourable conditions for cooperation in the \r\nregion in the implementation of transportation and \r\ncommunication projects aimed at gaining access to \r\nsouthern sea ports. The creation of new multi-optional \r\ntransport corridors and the restoration of the Great Silk \r\nRoad routes seek to establish a unified interconnected \r\nsystem of communications and to provide the Central \r\nAsian States with reliable access to promising markets. \r\nThe August opening of the bridge across the Pyandj \r\nRiver between Tajikistan and Afghanistan was among \r\nthe practical measures taken to achieve that goal. \r\n The magnitude of the challenges facing the \r\ninternational community requires the further \r\nstrengthening of our Organization. There is no doubt \r\nthat all of us must do our utmost to make the United \r\nNations even more effective in addressing current \r\nissues. For that reason, we believe that all of us must \r\nshoulder our responsibilities towards the Organization, \r\nin the interests of all Member States. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Claude Heller, chairman of the delegation of the \r\nUnited Mexican States. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Permit \r\nme to express to you, Sir, my delegation’s warm \r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We \r\nare convinced that you will be able to skilfully guide \r\nour efforts to attain the common objectives that we \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 26 \r\n \r\nhave set for the session. I should also like to express \r\nMexico’s gratitude for the excellent work of your \r\npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa. \r\n Likewise, I wish to express my gratitude to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the work \r\naccomplished on major items on our agenda during the \r\nfirst months of his mandate. I also wish to congratulate \r\nhim on the high-level event on climate change, held \r\nlast week, which undoubtedly helped to raise \r\nawareness about an issue that deserves priority \r\nattention. \r\n At a time when the international community is \r\nfacing many challenges that test our capacity to fulfil \r\nthe purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, it is essential to strengthen and make effective \r\nuse of multilateral institutions. In that connection, the \r\nOrganization must daily reaffirm itself as the \r\nindisputable centre for coexistence among States and \r\nthe guarantor of compliance with international law. \r\nMexico, as a founding Member of this pre-eminent \r\nuniversal forum, takes this opportunity to reaffirm its \r\nfirm and decisive commitment to multilateralism. \r\n We are living in a complex world situation \r\ncharacterized by armed conflicts of various sorts, \r\nincluding inter-ethnic conflicts that are not confined by \r\nborders; the commission of terrorist acts; the \r\ndestabilizing activities of transnational organized \r\ncrime; the proliferation of the arms race in all its \r\naspects; and environmental degradation, situations of \r\nabject poverty, social exclusion and discrimination and \r\npandemics affecting broad sectors of the world \r\npopulation. That is why, more than ever before, we \r\nneed an Organization capable of meeting the needs of \r\nwomen and men throughout the world. In that context, \r\nwe must think about the role of the United Nations.  \r\n Mexico sees three fundamental approaches for \r\nharmonizing relations among States and addressing the \r\ngreat challenges of our time: shared responsibility in \r\nthe face of globalization, the promotion of human \r\nsecurity for development and the responsibility to \r\ncooperate in the multilateral arena.  \r\n Every State is responsible, to its own society and \r\nto the international community, for guaranteeing the \r\nrule of law and the full enjoyment of human rights, \r\npromoting development, protecting the environment \r\nand countering new threats to security in order to \r\nprovide the best possible living conditions for its \r\npeople. The actions of the Government of Mexico at \r\nthe internal level are based on those pillars so as to \r\nguarantee the rule of law throughout the national \r\nterritory, given the onslaught of organized crime, and \r\nto reaffirm the authority of the State in the full exercise \r\nof its responsibilities.  \r\n The security of the population is not limited to \r\nthe physical protection of individuals. That is why \r\nhuman security must be understood as a broad and \r\nintegral concept that can meet the needs of society as a \r\nwhole. It is a concept that includes elements ranging \r\nfrom strict respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms to adequate preparation of the population to \r\ndeal with natural disasters or pandemics.  \r\n Mindful of the value of the individual, the \r\nGovernment of Mexico bases its activities on the quest \r\nfor sustainable human development, which means \r\nseeking to promote the comprehensive development of \r\nindividuals in all aspects — social, economic, political, \r\ncultural, human and environmental — and to do it in \r\nsuch a way as to ensure that future generations have \r\nopportunities to achieve well-being.  \r\n Within the framework of multilateral institutions, \r\nStates have freely shouldered the obligation to \r\ncooperate with others in addressing all problems in \r\nareas such as, inter alia, combating drug trafficking and \r\nterrorism and preserving the environment, in which \r\ninternal efforts alone are insufficient and concerted \r\naction is required. \r\n Shared responsibility in the face of globalization, \r\npromoting human security for development and the \r\nresponsibility to cooperate in the multilateral arena are \r\namong the main concerns of our Organization. A good \r\nexample of this is climate change. As the \r\nSecretary-General himself has indicated, climate \r\nchange is among the most serious, complex and \r\nmultifaceted threats confronting the world. Mexico \r\nfavours the multilateral climate change regime \r\ndeveloped within the United Nations as an ideal \r\nframework for shaping commitments to be adopted in \r\nthe near future. The United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \r\nare the appropriate areas for negotiation. \r\n Emerging and developing countries must consider \r\nthe fact that the costs of inaction of passivity in the \r\nface of climate change will be to the detriment of their \r\nown development efforts. We in Mexico have \r\nunderstood this. The national development plan 2007-\r\n2012 includes actions related to environmental \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n27 07-52646 \r\n \r\nsustainability, with two specific objectives: reducing \r\nemissions of greenhouse gases and promoting measures \r\nto adapt to the effects of climate change. The inaction \r\nof others must not be a pretext for failing to do our \r\npart. We are convinced that shared but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities must motivate all countries to take \r\naction to the best of their abilities and that developed \r\ncountries, without exception, must contribute \r\nsubstantially to the collective effort in the \r\ntechnological and financial sphere. \r\n Mexico believes that we must break away from \r\nthe limitations of the Clean Development Mechanism \r\nof the Kyoto Protocol, whereby the achievement of \r\ndeveloped countries’ goals depends on their \r\ngeographical location. What we need are positive \r\nincentives to supplement, not replace, the national \r\nefforts of developing countries. It is urgent that such \r\nincentives reward the efforts of beneficiary countries \r\nthat make such efforts in their own interests. \r\nAccordingly, those that do more should receive greater \r\nsupport.  \r\n In recent years, the international community has \r\nhad to face a series of challenges in the fight against \r\nterrorism. One of those challenges has been to \r\nguarantee the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity in the face of terrorism’s evil effects without \r\nrenouncing the universal and absolute values of human \r\nrights. That is an essential condition for civilized \r\ncoexistence within and beyond our borders.  \r\n The United Nations has determined, in a number \r\nof commitments, that measures adopted by States to \r\ncombat terrorism and to protect their citizens and \r\nprovide adequate security for them must respect \r\nobligations undertaken in accordance with international \r\nlaw, in particular human rights norms, the rights of \r\nrefugees and international humanitarian law.  \r\n Promoting and protecting human rights is one of \r\nthe highest priorities for the Government of Mexico. \r\nWe, the international community, have the \r\nresponsibility to ensure universal and indivisible \r\nrespect for human rights for all, regardless of the \r\ncircumstances. Today, the situation in Myanmar \r\ndemands our attention.  \r\n The creation of the Human Rights Council and \r\nthe adoption of the institutional reform package, which \r\nincludes the establishment of a universal periodic \r\nreview mechanism, have marked a watershed in \r\nbuilding a more just and equitable international system \r\nfor human rights. Double standards in this area can no \r\nlonger exist. With objectivity and in a spirit of \r\ncooperation, we must promote the evaluation of human \r\nrights in all Member States without any distinction. \r\nThat effort strengthens the essential role of the \r\nOrganization in developing international norms to \r\nprotect human rights and represents the most solid \r\nfoundation for achieving the well-being of our peoples.  \r\n In that regard, we welcome the recent adoption of \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities and the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples. Mexico remains open to \r\nscrutiny by treaty bodies and to special procedures on \r\nhuman rights, which have played an essential role in \r\nidentifying the challenges our country still faces.  \r\n Given the multidimensional nature of \r\ninternational migration, Mexico believes that our \r\nOrganization is the most fitting forum for dealing with \r\nthese problems, on the basis of the principle of shared \r\nresponsibility and of strengthening cooperation among \r\nStates directly affected by that phenomenon. The issue \r\nof migration can in no way be limited solely to its State \r\nsecurity aspects. We must have a comprehensive \r\nunderstanding based on respect for the human rights of \r\nall migrants, regardless of their legal status, taking into \r\naccount the economic, social and cultural implications \r\nof the phenomenon.  \r\n We say this from our own experience. Mexico is \r\na country of origin, transit and destination for \r\nmigrants. For that reason, in addition to recognizing \r\nour own responsibility domestically, we must adopt \r\neffective measures to strengthen the international \r\nframework for the protection of migrants. The \r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the \r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \r\nFamilies is, without a doubt, a valuable reference \r\npoint. While we recognize the need to cooperate in that \r\narea, Mexico is shouldering its own responsibility to \r\ncreate conditions so that our compatriots are able to \r\nfind more and better opportunities within our country. \r\nThat is why the Government of President Felipe \r\nCalderón is taking action on a number of fronts to \r\npromote public and private investment in order to \r\ndevelop programmes to create more jobs; to increase \r\naccess to secondary and post-secondary education; to \r\nguarantee access to medical services, including in the \r\nmost isolated and marginalized areas of the country; to \r\nensure social security coverage; and to reduce \r\ninequality among our citizens. \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 28 \r\n \r\n It is clear that the success of our development \r\npolicies requires a favourable international economic \r\nenvironment and cooperation among States. The United \r\nNations is playing an essential role in providing \r\ntechnical assistance and monitoring the implementation \r\nof commitments undertaken by the international \r\ncommunity at the major conferences, summits and \r\nforums sponsored by the Organization.  \r\n Seven years from the date set for the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, we note with \r\nconcern that while significant progress has been \r\nachieved in some areas of the world, in other areas \r\nthere are still delays and even steps backward. We \r\nrecognize that each country is responsible for its own \r\ndevelopment. However, national efforts must be \r\naccompanied by international action based on the \r\nglobal alliance forged at the International Conference \r\non Financing for Development, held in Monterrey, \r\nMexico. That will ensure complementarity between \r\nnational strategies and the development of the world \r\neconomy. Mexico hopes that the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil’s new Development Cooperation Forum and \r\nthe international review conference on the Monterrey \r\nConsensus to be held in Doha in 2008 will be steps in \r\nthat direction.  \r\n International security requires renewed \r\ncommitments. Although there has been a numerical \r\nreduction in nuclear arsenals since the end of the cold \r\nwar, it is disturbing to see the growing sophistication \r\nof related technology. Unfortunately, that points to a \r\nnew phase in the arms race. Mexico is convinced that \r\nthe only guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons \r\nis a progressive reduction aimed at their complete \r\nelimination and the certainty that they will never be \r\nproduced again. As one of the initial steps for \r\nachieving nuclear disarmament, the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must enter into force as soon \r\nas possible. Mexico also believes that the vital \r\nstrengthening of the non-proliferation regime requires \r\nthe fulfilment of obligations undertaken by all States, \r\nnuclear and non-nuclear, under the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), with a \r\nview to its universalization. If no progress is achieved \r\non non-proliferation or disarmament, fear, mistrust and \r\ngreater insecurity will prevail. In this regard, the NPT \r\nreview conference to be held in 2010 is a new \r\nopportunity for safeguarding and strengthening these \r\nobjectives.  \r\n We welcome the agreements recently reached \r\nwith the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We \r\nare convinced that the ongoing controversy over \r\nnuclear matters in the case of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran must be resolved through diplomacy and strict \r\ncompliance with commitments undertaken within the \r\nframework of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  \r\n Mexico supports the resolution of conflicts in \r\nvarious regions through dialogue, negotiations and full \r\nrespect for international law. That is particularly true in \r\ndealing with the most critical items on the United \r\nNations agenda.  \r\n We are following with particular attention recent \r\ndevelopments on various aspects of the situation in the \r\nMiddle East and their impact on international stability. \r\nWe support efforts aimed at a new peace process \r\nbetween Israel and Palestine, convinced that a final \r\nsolution can be achieved only through negotiation \r\nbetween the parties with the active support of the \r\ninternational community. We hope that in the very near \r\nfuture the State of Israel and a politically and \r\neconomically viable Palestinian State can coexist \r\nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders, \r\nin accordance with the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions.  \r\n If multilateralism has returned, it is now up to \r\nStates to show the political will necessary to promote \r\nconcrete reform, ranging from adjusting the Security \r\nCouncil to meet the needs of our time to ensuring \r\ngreater coherence in action to promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The response to the institutional crisis of \r\nrecent years does not lie in alternative mechanisms or \r\nunilateral or partial approaches, but rather, we must \r\ngive the Organization the necessary tools to carry out \r\nits responsibilities effectively.  \r\n Mexico believes that expanding the Security \r\nCouncil is an unavoidable necessity in order to make \r\nthat body more representative. In this regard, my \r\nGovernment favours increasing the number of \r\nnon-permanent members, with the possibility of being \r\nre-elected in order to promote accountability. We \r\nbelieve that any other formula will highlight existing \r\ninequalities. \r\n Mexico is the tenth largest contributor to this \r\nOrganization and a country loyal to the cause of the \r\nUnited Nations. We are committed to its reform and \r\nready to shoulder greater responsibilities on the \r\ninternational scene. In line with this vision, Mexico has \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n29 07-52646 \r\n \r\nsubmitted its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council for the 2009-2010 period. \r\n The Government of Mexico has expressed its \r\npolitical will to constructively participate in the work \r\nof the Council in the areas of maintaining international \r\npeace and security and dealing with questions on the \r\nworld agenda that are within the purview of the \r\nCouncil.  \r\n On this basis, Mexico reaffirms its determination \r\nto actively contribute to building a more secure, \r\ndemocratic and equitable international society. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Philip Sealy, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. \r\n Mr. Sealy (Trinidad and Tobago): I wish to take \r\nthis opportunity to congratulate you most sincerely on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session. My delegation is confident \r\nthat your in-depth knowledge of international \r\neconomic and political issues, complemented by your \r\nextensive diplomatic experience, will serve you in \r\ngood stead to guide our deliberations effectively in the \r\ncoming months. \r\n I also wish to take this opportunity to express \r\nTrinidad and Tobago’s deep appreciation for the \r\nleadership of your predecessor, Her Excellency \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, the first Arab woman \r\nto hold that lofty position. As President of the General \r\nAssembly, her efforts contributed to focusing the \r\nattention of the international community on the \r\npressing challenges of climate change, inter alia, \r\nthereby facilitating, in the process, global awareness \r\nand increased support for internationally agreed action \r\non this issue given its impact on our planet and, \r\nespecially, on the very survival of several small island \r\ndeveloping States. \r\n I consider this occasion opportune, as well, to \r\nconvey Trinidad and Tobago’s unequivocal support for \r\nour current Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon. We commend his leadership role in the \r\ntroubling humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of \r\nthe Sudan and applaud his initiative to convene the \r\nHigh-Level Event on Climate Change. These are \r\nindeed apt demonstrations of his willingness to \r\nconfront forcefully and resolutely issues of \r\ntranscendental importance to the present and future \r\nwell-being of peoples everywhere. \r\n Though small in size and population, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, through visionary leadership, transparency \r\nand public accountability and prudent management of \r\nour natural resources, is continuing along a path of \r\nsustainable development. Our development strategy \r\nseeks to go beyond the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and to ensure that by the \r\nyear 2020 all sectors of our multi-ethnic and \r\nmulticultural society will enjoy a standard of living \r\ncomparable to that of the developed world. \r\n The performance of our economy draws its \r\nstrength from vertically integrated and well-developed \r\nenergy and petrochemical industries, which are \r\ncomplemented by buoyant and competitive \r\nmanufacturing and service sectors, including financial \r\nservices and tourism, as well as by the ongoing \r\ntransformation of the agricultural sector. All these \r\nfactors provide the basis for economic growth levels \r\noff 8.6 per cent over the last five years and a recorded \r\nrate of 12 per cent in 2006. We have also been able to \r\nachieve a 7 per cent reduction in poverty from a high \r\nof 24 per cent in 1998 and are currently experiencing a \r\nlow unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent.  \r\n It is on the basis of this strong economic \r\nperformance that Trinidad and Tobago has continued \r\nits commitment to the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), as we seek to advance the integration \r\nprocess, moving from the current stage of the single \r\nmarket to that of a single economy. Effective \r\nparticipation in this process of furthering strengthening \r\nand deepening the regional integration movement \r\nremains a major foreign policy goal of the Government \r\nof the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is for this \r\nreason and given the fact that our economic fortunes \r\nare inextricably linked, that Trinidad and Tobago \r\ncontinues to provide economic and humanitarian \r\nassistance to several CARICOM countries adversely \r\naffected by natural disasters. \r\n Our further economic development and that of \r\nthe global community as a whole, is dependent on the \r\nexistence of global peace and security. In this regard, \r\nthe Security Council has continued to take timely \r\ndecisions on global crises in different parts of the \r\nglobe, on terrorism and on nuclear non-proliferation.  \r\n The reform of that principal organ of the United \r\nNations, charged with maintaining international peace \r\nand security, continues, however, to elude us. It is time \r\nto engage in bona fide negotiations on this matter. The \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 30 \r\n \r\nstatus quo is unacceptable. The Security Council must \r\nbe reformed to reflect the current geopolitical realities \r\nof the twenty-first century and no longer the world as it \r\nwas in the aftermath of World War II. New and \r\nimportant actors from Africa, Asia and Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean are a part of today’s global reality. \r\nAn expanded and enhanced Security Council would \r\nprovide the Council with even greater legitimacy and \r\nsupport in the carrying out of its Charter \r\nresponsibilities. Trinidad and Tobago is of the view \r\nthat much progress was made during the sixty-first \r\nsession and the political momentum which was \r\ngenerated there should not be lost.  \r\n A reinvigorated Security Council is needed to \r\naddress the major issues that continue to bedevil \r\ncontemporary international relations. In the Middle \r\nEast, the failure to move forward on the peace process \r\nhas set back global efforts to achieve a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. The \r\nPalestinian people have yet to exercise their legitimate \r\nrights to self-determination and to the establishment of \r\nan independent Palestinian State in an undivided \r\nhomeland.  \r\n We call on the Quartet to resume the Road Map \r\nprocess for peace in the Middle East, so that the world \r\ncan, in the foreseeable future, see two States, Israel and \r\nPalestine, living side by side in peace, within \r\ninternationally recognized and secure borders. \r\nAdditionally, internationally acceptable solutions must \r\nbe found to address the fate of the Palestinian refugees, \r\nthe status of Jerusalem and the issue of Israeli \r\nsettlements in the West Bank. All these matters have \r\nremained pending for far too long and the Palestinians \r\nshould no longer be denied the realization of their \r\nstatehood. \r\n While there has been little or no progress in the \r\nmatter of peace in the Middle East, the Government of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is pleased to note \r\nthat, with respect to the humanitarian crisis in the \r\nDarfur region of the Sudan, agreement has finally been \r\nreached, which has resulted in the deployment of a \r\nhybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping \r\nforce for Darfur. We welcome this positive \r\ndevelopment. While we hope that the hybrid United \r\nNations-African Union peacekeeping force will bring \r\npeace and stability to the region and enable \r\nhumanitarian relief to flow once again to where it is \r\nmost urgently required, all our efforts must now be \r\nturned towards putting a cease-fire in place and \r\nstriving to have all the rebels groups fighting in Darfur \r\nmove towards a peace arrangement with the Sudanese \r\nGovernment. Peace and justice are, however, \r\ninextricably linked and there can be no lasting peace in \r\nDarfur without accountability for the heinous crimes \r\ncommitted against the people of Darfur during the \r\nconflict. \r\n While international political and security \r\ndevelopments continue to pose major difficulties for \r\nthe international community, developments in the area \r\nof international trade give rise to even greater concern. \r\nWe are mindful of the reality that the steadfast efforts \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago, of the subregion and of other \r\ndeveloping countries to confront effectively the \r\nchallenges of globalization and liberalization would be \r\nrendered futile in the absence of a fair, transparent and \r\nequitable international economic trading system. The \r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago therefore remains \r\ndeeply concerned that, after many years of protracted \r\nnegotiations characterized by many missed deadlines, \r\nthe Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations has \r\nyet to reach a compromise that would pave the way for \r\nan agreed outcome, particularly in the areas of \r\nagriculture and industrial products, and that \r\nincorporates the development dimension. We \r\nunderscore the importance of ensuring that the \r\nprinciple of special and differential treatment is truly \r\nreflected throughout the negotiating modalities, and we \r\ncall upon all parties in the negotiations to take fully \r\ninto account the special needs of small and vulnerable \r\neconomies. \r\n The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and \r\nTobago fully expects that the negotiations will resume \r\nin good faith and that there will be commensurate \r\nprogress in agriculture, industrial products and all \r\nother areas of the negotiations, in keeping with the \r\nmandate of a single undertaking. That will ensure the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Round and an outcome \r\nthat fully reflects the commitment undertaken at Doha \r\nto put development at the heart of the multilateral \r\ntrading system. \r\n While those trade negotiations seem to have \r\nstalled and will require the injection of a high degree \r\nof political will to bring them to a successful \r\nconclusion, the international community is faced with \r\nyet another global concern in the form of climate \r\nchange. As a result of greenhouse gas emissions from \r\nfossil fuel use and land-use changes through \r\ndeforestation, the world is already destined to an \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n31 07-52646 \r\n \r\nincrease of 1.14 degrees Celsius by the end of the next \r\ntwo decades. \r\n There therefore needs to be a clearly defined \r\nglobal mitigation strategy that keeps the long-term \r\ntemperature increase at less than 2 degrees Celsius \r\nabove pre-industrial levels. Increases over 2 degrees \r\nCelsius are very likely to have an increased adverse \r\nimpact on small island developing States, such as \r\nTrinidad and Tobago. In order to avoid a global climate \r\ndisaster, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago calls for urgent and ambitious action by all \r\nStates in accordance with their common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities, respective capabilities \r\nand social and economic conditions. \r\n As a State party to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the \r\nKyoto Protocol, we call on all States parties to \r\nUNFCCC, particularly major emitters of greenhouse \r\ngases, to agree at Bali to launch negotiations on a \r\npost-2012 regime. In those negotiations, the \r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago and other \r\nlike-minded Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\nmember States will seek to achieve substantial and \r\nlegally binding emission reductions in the shortest \r\ntimeframe possible and significant increases in the \r\nlevel of resources available to developing countries, in \r\nparticular small island developing States, to assist them \r\nin adapting to the adverse effects of climate change. To \r\nthis end, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago has already made a voluntary contribution \r\nof $1 million to the trust fund for the Caribbean \r\nCommunity Climate Change Centre in Belize to \r\nstrengthen that institution, so that it can assist \r\nCARICOM member States in implementing their \r\nadaptation strategies to deal with the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change. \r\n But we in the Caribbean are not only concerned \r\nabout global warming and its adverse effects on \r\nCaribbean States. We are also deeply interested in \r\npreserving the marine environment of the Caribbean \r\nSea, which is an important natural resource for all its \r\nlittoral island and continental States, given their \r\nvarying degrees of dependence on tourism. The \r\npassage through the Caribbean Sea of ships carrying \r\nradioactive waste is an issue to which all CARICOM \r\nGovernments attach the highest importance. Allow me \r\nto take this opportunity to reiterate the continued \r\nobjection of Caribbean countries against the use of the \r\nCaribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of radioactive \r\nwaste. The repeated scientific and safety reports may \r\noffer some reassurance, but they do very little to \r\nappease our concern. \r\n Our Prime Minister, Mr. Patrick Manning, in his \r\n2008 budget statement, brought into sharp focus the \r\nvision of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago for our cosmopolitan society. He \r\nemphasized that the mission in which we as a nation \r\nare engaged collectively is a transformation process \r\naimed at bringing sustained prosperity and the requisite \r\nhigher quality of life to every individual, family and \r\ncommunity across the country. The Government has \r\ntherefore sought to give concrete expression to the \r\nnational quest for a highly competitive, productive, \r\ninnovative and caring society, in which all are \r\nencouraged to attain their highest potential and are \r\nfacilitated in doing so. \r\n It is, accordingly, in this spirit that we have just \r\nsigned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities, which was adopted and opened for \r\nsignature during the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, and we will take steps to ratify the \r\nConvention once the necessary implementing \r\nlegislation is put in place to complement what is \r\nalready provided for in our domestic policy with regard \r\nto persons with disabilities. \r\n It is this confidence in and respect for the \r\ninternational rule of law that has encouraged Trinidad \r\nand Tobago to campaign, since the late 1980s and at \r\nthe highest political levels, for the establishment of an \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). We are keenly \r\naware of the important strides being made by ICC, as it \r\ndevotes its attention to the prosecution of individuals \r\naccused of committing the crimes within its \r\njurisdiction, namely, genocide, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago recalls in this connection the \r\nadoption at the Rome Diplomatic Conference of a \r\nresolution recommending that a conference to review \r\nthe Court’s Statute also consider the inclusion of \r\ntrafficking in illegal drugs on an international scale as \r\nbeing within the Court’s jurisdiction. We must seize the \r\nopportunity now forced upon us by international trends \r\nto fully engage ICC in efforts to stem the tide of that \r\nscourge, and similarly, to consider the inclusion of acts \r\nof terrorism, once that term is clearly defined by the \r\ninternational community. \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 32 \r\n \r\n Our approach will be grounded in the recognition \r\nof the continued deleterious effects that the \r\ninternational trade in illegal drugs is having on the \r\nsocial fabric of societies the world over, including in \r\nthe Caribbean. The time has come for the international \r\ncommunity to recognize the illicit trafficking of drugs \r\nas an international crime subject to the jurisdiction of \r\nICC. \r\n Another area of public international law to which \r\nTrinidad and Tobago attaches the utmost importance is \r\nthe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea. This year’s meeting of the United Nations \r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans \r\nand the Law of the Sea addressed the important issue \r\nof marine genetic resources. Part XI of the Convention \r\nexplicitly provides that the area beyond national \r\njurisdiction and its resources are the common heritage \r\nof mankind. Trinidad and Tobago is accordingly of the \r\nview that any legal regime developed to regulate the \r\nmarine genetic resources of the Area must be guided by \r\nthe common heritage principle. Adherence to such a \r\nprinciple would ensure that the resources of the Area \r\nare exploited for the benefit of all members of the \r\ninternational community, and not just for the benefit of \r\nthose with the financial wherewithal and the technical \r\nknow-how. \r\n Similarly, we recognize that all States parties to \r\nthe Convention are ipso facto members of the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority. Despite the importance \r\nof the current work of the Authority on polymetallic \r\nsulphides and cobalt crusts, many States parties fail to \r\nattend the annual sessions of the Authority held in \r\nJamaica. The continued absence of States undermines \r\nthe common heritage principle laid down in Part XI of \r\nthe Convention and threatens the very legitimacy of the \r\nwork of the Authority. We accordingly call on all \r\nmembers of the Authority to attend regularly the \r\nsessions of the Authority and thus assist it in adopting \r\nregulations governing the exploration and exploitation \r\nof the mineral resources in the Area, which are of \r\nbenefit to all mankind. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago, like its Caribbean \r\nneighbours, acknowledges its maternal links to Africa \r\nand notes that 2007 was an important year for the \r\npeoples of that continent and for the African diaspora \r\nworldwide. Earlier this year, we observed here at \r\nHeadquarters and in the capitals of all CARICOM \r\nStates a programme of activities intended to raise the \r\nconsciousness of peoples the world over regarding the \r\nhorrors of the transatlantic slave trade and the \r\ndeleterious effects it had on Africa, depriving that \r\ncontinent of millions of its inhabitants, and on people \r\nof African descent in the Americas. We in Trinidad and \r\nTobago have used the opportunity to educate all of our \r\ncitizens on the degrading treatment to which those \r\nhuman beings were subjected and to demonstrate that, \r\nnotwithstanding our history of slavery, followed by the \r\nindentureship of other segments of our population, the \r\npeople of Trinidad and Tobago have developed a \r\nharmonious cosmopolitan society, which is an \r\naccomplishment worthy of emulation in other parts of \r\nthe globe that are fractured by fratricidal ethnic and \r\nreligious struggles. \r\n In order for the suffering of millions of enslaved \r\nAfricans not to have been in vain, the Government of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago intends to make a \r\nfinancial contribution to the CARICOM initiative for a \r\npermanent memorial to be erected within these \r\nhallowed walls of the United Nations in remembrance \r\nof all those who perished in the Middle Passage and on \r\nthe plantations in the New World in their struggle for \r\nfreedom and liberation from the yoke of slavery. We \r\ncall upon the international community to contribute \r\ngenerously to such a worthwhile and historic venture. \r\n In conclusion, the United Nations remains a \r\ncentre for harmonizing the goals and aspirations of all \r\nmankind. There is no other universal forum with \r\ngreater legitimacy or a more suitable mandate to bring \r\nabout an improvement in the human condition. We \r\nmust address all these global issues with firmness of \r\npurpose and in a resolute manner if we are to save \r\ncoming generations from the adverse consequences of \r\nwar, underdevelopment and poverty, as well as the \r\ndeleterious effects of climate change, and to ensure that \r\nall humanity can enjoy improved standards of living in \r\nfreedom and in dignity on a habitable planet. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joe Robert Pemagbi, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Sierra Leone. \r\n Mr. Pemagbi (Sierra Leone): The Sierra Leone \r\ndelegation would like to join others in congratulating \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the \r\nwork of the General Assembly at this session. We also \r\ntake this opportunity to commend your predecessor for \r\nher contribution to the work of the Assembly, in \r\nparticular for her initiatives in the ongoing process of \r\nthe United Nations reform. \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n33 07-52646 \r\n \r\n Allow me to convey to you, the \r\nSecretary-General and this Assembly greetings from \r\nthe newly elected President of Sierra Leone, His \r\nExcellency Ernest Bai Koroma, who took the oath of \r\noffice just two weeks ago. President Koroma was not \r\nable to come to this debate because of time constraints. \r\n Sierra Leone would like to reaffirm its \r\ncommitment to the United Nations as the only \r\ninternational body that has the capacity to combat the \r\nmultifarious problems of the world. The salvation of \r\nthe world from conflict, natural disasters, diseases, \r\nhunger, poverty, oppression, abuse and violation of \r\nrights and the menace of climate change, and the \r\nachievement of our development goals will remain \r\ndistant dreams without multilateral action. The stronger \r\nour United Nations, the greater our chances to realize \r\nthe objectives for which we set it up. That is why \r\nSierra Leone will never relent in its support for the \r\nreform process of the United Nations to enable it to \r\nrespond appropriately to its numerous, diverse and \r\never-increasing challenges. \r\n The reform exercise has scored some major \r\nsuccesses, but the most critical and contentious reform — \r\nthat of the Security Council — remains elusive. As \r\nlong as the status quo is maintained, Africa will remain \r\ndisadvantaged, as the only continent without a voice of \r\npermanent representation on the Council. We therefore \r\nurge a speedy consideration of the expansion of, and \r\nequitable representation on, the Council, to make it \r\nmore representative, democratic and accountable and \r\ntherefore more effective. \r\n A new dawn has broken in the political landscape \r\nof Sierra Leone. Once again, Sierra Leone has \r\ndemonstrated exemplary performance in the area of the \r\nconsolidation of democracy and governance. We would \r\nlike to acknowledge with humility the messages of \r\ncommendation we received from various parts of the \r\nworld for the conduct of the recent parliamentary and \r\npresidential elections. As one influential Western \r\nmedia organization put it, Sierra Leone is a pearl in the \r\npolitical crown of African politics. \r\n My delegation welcomes the statement issued by \r\nthe members of the Security Council in which they \r\ncongratulated the people and institutions of Sierra \r\nLeone, in particular the National Electoral Commission \r\nand the Sierra Leone Police, on their conduct in the \r\nelection period and the commitment they demonstrated \r\nto the democratic process. President Koroma has asked \r\nme to convey, on behalf of all Sierra Leoneans, sincere \r\nthanks to members of the international community for \r\ntheir invaluable contribution to the electoral process. \r\nWe are grateful in particular for the logistical support \r\nthat the various institutions concerned with the election \r\nreceived to enable them to perform their respective \r\nfunctions. As the new President said after taking the \r\noath of office, the people of Sierra Leone must \r\ncongratulate themselves for their historic resolve to \r\nensure the victory of democracy and the free exercise \r\nof the will of the people. \r\n No one can deny that, after a brutal civil war, \r\nSierra Leone has enjoyed five years of relative peace. \r\nHowever, peace is not an event. It transcends the \r\nsigning of ceasefire and peace agreements. It also \r\ntranscends the successful disarmament and \r\ndemobilization of ex-combatants, and the official \r\ndeclaration of the end of armed conflict.  \r\n Peace is a process, a process that must be \r\nconsolidated, maintained and sustained. Indeed, that is \r\nwhy the United Nations was established after two \r\nworld wars: to promote social progress and better \r\nstandards of life for the peoples of the world and to \r\nunite our strength in order to maintain international \r\npeace and security. The establishment of the new \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to facilitate post-conflict \r\nrecovery is consistent with the objectives of the \r\nOrganization. It adds to the true meaning and scope of \r\nthe concept of peace.  \r\n The Sierra Leone Government considers the \r\nrecent elections as part of the peace process. The \r\npeople have once again exercised their constitutional \r\nright to choose the men and women they would like to \r\nserve the nation. Now we must not forget that the \r\npeople also have a right to economic and social \r\ndevelopment. The right to vote is inextricably linked to \r\nthe rights to food, clean and portable water, basic \r\nsocial services and, of course, development. All the \r\npraise, all the commendation that Sierra Leoneans have \r\nreceived in connection with the exercise of their \r\npolitical right, the right to vote, will be meaningless \r\nunless we create and intensify our collective efforts to \r\nensure that they see and enjoy the dividends of that \r\nprocess.  \r\n Periodic elections are important, but they are not \r\na panacea for all needs. Now that the elections are \r\nover, the Government is determined to meet the \r\nchallenge of translating the exercise of a political right \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 34 \r\n \r\ninto the realization of the economic and social rights of \r\nall Sierra Leoneans. There is indeed a change of \r\nGovernment, but that change needs urgent and \r\nsubstantial support to produce its desired dividends for \r\nthe citizens. Accordingly, I would like to solicit the \r\nsupport of the United Nations, the entire international \r\ncommunity and our bilateral partners to help us to \r\ndeliver on the expectations linked to that change. \r\n Sierra Leone will continue to have high \r\nexpectations for the United Nations, including its \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding Fund. \r\nSierra Leone was selected as one of the first two \r\ncountries on the Commission’s agenda, and thus \r\nbecame eligible for funding, which has already had a \r\npositive impact on our ability to consolidate the peace. \r\nWe thank the Commission and the Fund for that timely \r\nconsideration. We note with appreciation, for instance, \r\nthe timely support that the Sierra Leone Police \r\nreceived from the Peacebuilding Fund to enhance their \r\ncapacity to manage public order during the recent \r\nelections. \r\n The four priority areas that have been identified \r\nby the Government in consultation with the \r\nCommission, the United Nations system in Sierra \r\nLeone and other stakeholders, including civil society, \r\nare still valid. They are all equally important. However, \r\nin view of the inherent urgency and the critical nature \r\nof the youth problem, the Government will make sure, \r\nas far as possible, that youth employment and \r\nempowerment continue to be accorded first priority. \r\n We hope that the details of the integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategy or framework for cooperation \r\nwith Sierra Leone will soon be finalized. While \r\nrecognizing the importance of partnership and \r\naccountability, we strongly believe that national \r\nownership must be the core principle of the framework. \r\n While Sierra Leoneans are being showered with \r\ncommendations for the outcome of the elections, and \r\ndeservedly so, and while the nation is today being held \r\nin high esteem in the area of political and \r\nconstitutional order, we must not forget that the \r\ncountry still finds itself in the unenviable position of \r\nbeing ranked one of the least developed countries in \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme’s human \r\ndevelopment index. Unfortunately for Sierra Leone and \r\nthe rest of the developing world, the prospects for \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nby the year 2015 remain cloudy and distant. My \r\ndelegation shares the view that practical steps must be \r\ntaken as a matter of urgency to accelerate the process \r\nof meeting the goals. We therefore welcome the recent \r\nlaunching of the MDG Africa Steering Group, chaired \r\nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, to mobilize the \r\nheads of the United Nations system and major \r\nmultilateral and intergovernmental organizations in \r\nsupport of African States in their effort to meet the \r\nMDGs.  \r\n In principle, we support all initiatives that could \r\nat least get Africa on track. Those include Prime \r\nMinister Gordon Brown’s MDG call to action of last \r\nJuly, and the declaration signed by a number of Heads \r\nof State and Government and private-sector leaders. \r\nWe, for our part, acknowledge our responsibility to \r\nmeet the Goals. However, we strongly believe that the \r\ndeveloped countries should fulfil their commitments as \r\npartners in an interdependent world, with special \r\nsupport preference for countries emerging from \r\nconflict, in order to accelerate their progress towards \r\nmeeting the goals. \r\n Sierra Leone will continue to foster and maintain \r\nfriendly relations with all Members States of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular those in our immediate \r\nneighbourhood, members of the Mano River Union and \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS). That is why, less than a week after \r\nassuming office, President Koroma paid a visit to the \r\ntwo other founding members of the Mano River Union, \r\nLiberia and Guinea, and to Burkina Faso, the current \r\nChair of ECOWAS. \r\n For far too long, the situation in some of our \r\ncountries has been a threat to regional and international \r\npeace and security. Sierra Leone would like to assure \r\nthis Assembly that it stands ready to reverse that trend \r\nin the subregion of West Africa, to help reduce tension, \r\nprevent armed conflict and strengthen institutions and \r\nmachinery that have been created primarily to promote \r\nthe economic and social well-being of people. \r\n We will continue to work assiduously with the \r\nUnited Nations, the African Union, ECOWAS, the \r\nEuropean Union and individual sovereign States to \r\npursue the goals of peace and security enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, for Africa and the rest \r\nof the world. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe general debate.  \r\n A/62/PV.16\r\n \r\n35 07-52646 \r\n \r\n As we conclude the annual general debate, I \r\nwould like to thank all participants for their insightful \r\ncontributions. The presence of almost 100 heads of \r\nState or Government and approximately 80 Ministers \r\nfor Foreign Affairs is a mark of the importance the \r\nworld places on this unique Assembly. \r\n Beyond the general debate, there has been a \r\nflurry of diplomatic activity, including many high-level \r\nevents convened by the Secretary-General. We have \r\nincreased our visibility and the public and media have \r\nresponded positively. I am grateful that speakers \r\ndirectly addressed the five priority topics that I set out, \r\nand that they pointed the way forward. I am also \r\ngrateful to those leaders who spared the time to discuss \r\nthose priorities with me in more detail. With that \r\nmandate, I intend to work closely with all of you to \r\nachieve the results that your heads of delegation have \r\ncalled for. \r\n The latest reports on the accelerated melting of \r\nthe Arctic have unnerved the experts. We need to be on \r\nhigh alert. Responding to the challenge of climate \r\nchange, we have sent a strong political message that \r\nthe time for talk has passed and the time for action has \r\nbegun. I believe an important shift has taken place. \r\nClimate change has become the flagship issue of the \r\nsixty-second session. \r\n There was overwhelming consensus that, in \r\nadapting to global warming, we must not set limits to \r\ngrowth but rather help achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We all agreed that we have common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities and there was, and \r\nrightly so, broad consensus that the United Nations \r\nmust remain at the centre of the process to reach a \r\nglobal agreement, including to strengthen international \r\nenvironmental governance. \r\n Many speakers also presented commendable \r\ninitiatives: to reduce deforestation and emissions; to \r\ninvest in flood prevention and food security; to \r\nintroduce tougher energy efficiency standards; to \r\nmobilize private sector investment in clean \r\ntechnologies; to improve carbon-trading mechanisms; \r\nand to accelerate technology and resource transfers. \r\n The idea of a road map to coordinate the United \r\nNations system on climate change and to complement \r\nnational efforts was endorsed by many. Given the \r\nurgency of the many calls for action, it is now up to \r\nMember States to deliver in Bali. \r\n Overwhelming support to make quicker progress \r\non the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was \r\nexpressed by leaders from all regions. Many of the \r\nGoals are off track, but in sub-Saharan Africa we may \r\nnot achieve a single Goal by 2015. That is indeed an \r\nemergency situation.  \r\n Many developing countries set out domestic \r\ninitiatives and new international partnerships to boost \r\neconomic growth; to empower women and children; to \r\nprovide better access to drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and other diseases. But many speakers also \r\nrecognized that a gap remains between promises and \r\ndelivery on aid, trade and domestic reforms. Achieving \r\nthe MDGs requires a global partnership, with everyone \r\nfulfilling their part of the compact. I am therefore \r\ngrateful that many participants supported convening an \r\nMDG leaders’ meeting this session. We must \r\ndemonstrate by our actions that we can and will \r\nachieve the Goals. \r\n It was also evident that many delegations want to \r\nsee further progress on financing for development as \r\nwe move towards the 2008 Doha conference. Many \r\nalso pointed out the significance of concluding a global \r\ndeal on trade for reducing poverty. We must press \r\nahead during the existing Round, as many agree the \r\ncurrent system is not sustainable. \r\n Terrorism in all forms was strongly condemned. \r\nThere was strong support to ensure full implementation \r\nof the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy and a broad desire for swift progress on a \r\nconvention. In that context, many also emphasized the \r\nneed to overcome ignorance and prejudice through a \r\nsustained dialogue among cultures and civilizations. \r\n On the eve of the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, many \r\nreaffirmed the importance of the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights for all. While some \r\naddressed the shortcomings of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, many also called for its strengthening in order \r\nthat it might live up to its full potential. \r\n In that context, reference was also made to the \r\nimportance of adherence to international law, human \r\nsecurity and the responsibility to protect, all of those \r\nbeing complementary to sustainable development, \r\npeace and security. \r\n A wide range of issues regarding peace and \r\nsecurity were raised. We have taken some small, but \r\nA/62/PV.16  \r\n \r\n07-52646 36 \r\n \r\nconcrete, steps in ongoing efforts towards sustainable \r\npolitical solutions in the Middle East, Iraq, \r\nAfghanistan, and Darfur. Concerns were also expressed \r\nabout recent events in Myanmar. \r\n Positive developments were reported in a number \r\nof post-conflict countries. In that regard, some \r\ndelegations noted the positive contribution that United \r\nNations peacekeepers had made, while others stressed \r\nthe need to strengthen the capacity of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n There were calls for improved progress on \r\ndisarmament, including concluding an arms trade \r\ntreaty, and for advancing non-proliferation. \r\n The idea of fairer migration policies was \r\nmentioned, and some raised the issue of growing links \r\nbetween organized crime, human trafficking and drugs. \r\n There is overall agreement that we could make \r\nfaster progress on all those issues, if our multilateral \r\ninstitutions better reflected contemporary realities, \r\nunderlining the need for improved progress on United \r\nNations reform. \r\n The Secretariat must be more effective, efficient \r\nand accountable to Member States, and some speakers \r\nput forward initiatives to achieve this. Resources \r\nthroughout the United Nations system must be \r\nmobilized and delivered more coherently on the \r\nground. \r\n We heard from countries engaged in and \r\nsupporting the “One United Nations” approach that \r\nthey are already seeing better results while others \r\nspoke in favour of strengthening the gender \r\narchitecture. \r\n There was wide-ranging support for concrete \r\nresults on Security Council reform, including through \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n The General Assembly is the only forum where \r\nwe can tackle many of those issues comprehensively. It \r\nis therefore incumbent on us to revitalize this House by \r\ntaking the necessary decisions on the priorities and \r\nchallenges that have been outlined. At the opening of \r\nthe general debate, I suggested that we could better \r\nachieve that goal if the General Assembly were more \r\ninteractive. I am grateful that members delivered. Let \r\nus continue in this spirit tomorrow at the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Peace and throughout the sixty-\r\nsecond session. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda  \r\nitem 8? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.45 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
