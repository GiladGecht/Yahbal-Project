(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation \r\nfor Peace \r\n \r\nAgenda item 49 \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/62/97 and \r\nA/62/337) \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly will now \r\nbegin the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace, \r\nunder agenda item 49, entitled “Culture of peace”, and \r\nin accordance with resolution 61/269, of 25 May 2007.  \r\n As members are aware, the High-level Dialogue \r\nwill discuss the overall theme of interreligious and \r\nintercultural cooperation for the promotion of \r\ntolerance, understanding and universal respect on \r\nmatters of freedom of religion or belief and cultural \r\ndiversity. \r\n I welcome all participants to the first High-level \r\nDialogue of the General Assembly on Interreligious \r\nand Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for \r\nPeace. By convening this event, the General Assembly \r\nhas taken an important stand. We are reaffirming the \r\nvalues enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But, \r\nmore important, we are taking concrete steps to \r\npromote those values around the world. \r\n During the general debate, heads of State and \r\nGovernment from all regions placed great emphasis on \r\nthe value of tolerance and mutual understanding. That \r\ndemonstrates the commitment of the international \r\ncommunity to promote those values. I would like in \r\nparticular to acknowledge the delegations of Pakistan \r\nand the Philippines for spearheading this initiative, \r\nwhich complements and builds upon other initiatives \r\nundertaken by the United Nations, including the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations. \r\n We live in unprecedented times. Cultures and \r\nreligions are being pulled ever closer together by a web \r\nof telecommunication and economic links. While \r\ncontributing to the richness of our human experience, \r\nthose encounters also reveal deep-rooted \r\nmisunderstandings. However, in this era of \r\nglobalization we have the unrivalled opportunity and \r\nresponsibility to replace intolerance and discrimination \r\nwith understanding and mutual acceptance. \r\n Open and sustained dialogue, respect for freedom \r\nof expression and freedom of religion or belief is \r\nfundamental to that endeavour. The United Nations has \r\na crucial role in promoting such a dialogue and \r\nadvancing the fundamental freedom that we must all \r\nrespect others’ religions and beliefs. In doing so, we \r\nshould also recognize that a crime committed in the \r\nname of religion is the greatest crime against religion, \r\nand that religion should not be used as a pretext for \r\nwar. \r\n In that regard, several recommendations emerged \r\nfrom the General Assembly’s thematic debate on the \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 2 \r\n \r\nsubject of civilizations and the challenge for peace, \r\nwhich was held earlier this year. Those \r\nrecommendations stated: that we must acknowledge the \r\nlegitimate rights of others to assert their identity, if we \r\nwant to have meaningful dialogue; that religious \r\nleaders have a duty, drawing on the principles of their \r\nown faiths, to promote mutual understanding and \r\ntolerance in their communities; and that there are \r\nalready many helpful tools available to promote \r\npositive encounters among people of different cultures. \r\nTo that end, we should all become instruments of \r\npeace. We must begin a global dialogue using public \r\ncampaigns and all forms of media to spread greater \r\nawareness of the issues.  \r\n Governments can play an additional role by \r\nadopting educational curricula that instil values of \r\npeace and tolerance. Children are not born with \r\nprejudice; it is learned. It is our common challenge to \r\neliminate, together, all distorted notions that deepen \r\nbarriers and widen divides, for they all originate in the \r\ndiscriminatory practices of the mind.  \r\n We can achieve this through a multifaceted \r\ndialogue that promotes unity in diversity and replaces \r\nmisunderstanding with mutual understanding and \r\nacceptance. The success of this global dialogue also \r\nrests on the active involvement of the media, the \r\nprivate sector, civil society, faith groups and \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs). Their insight \r\nand outreach will be instrumental in helping to achieve \r\nour goal. That is why I am delighted that later this \r\nafternoon the General Assembly will hold an \r\ninteractive hearing with those important stakeholders. \r\nAll Member States are invited to participate.  \r\n Next year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Many \r\npeople still feel that their rights are not respected. In \r\nsome regions, many people feel that their dignity has \r\nbeen violated and that internationally agreed principles \r\nand values are not equally applied to all. These issues \r\ncut to the core of the perceived lack of justice and the \r\npolitical instability in the world today.  \r\n To make peace some people believe that you need \r\nto forget. From my own experience, I would suggest \r\nthat reconciliation is a fair compromise between \r\nremembering and forgetting. The only means to \r\nachieve this is through intensive dialogue at both the \r\npolitical and the cultural and social levels. Promoting \r\nhuman dignity and equal access to rights and \r\nopportunities constitutes the cornerstone of this \r\nconversation. Here, I would like to quote the great \r\nDante Alighieri:  \r\n  “The greatest gift that God in his bounty \r\ncreated, and the most consonant with his \r\ngoodness, and that which he prizes the most, was \r\nfree will, with which all intelligent creatures, and \r\nthey alone, were and are endowed.”  \r\n In going forward then, let us each respect the \r\nuniqueness of each other’s perspective so that together \r\nwe can honour the rich diversity of humanity. \r\n I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.  \r\n The Secretary-General: I am honoured to be \r\nhere for this Dialogue. In the nine months that I have \r\nbeen in office, I have travelled to all corners of the \r\nunited nations, from Kinshasa to Kabul, from Brussels \r\nto Beirut. Everywhere I have visited, and among all the \r\ndifferent people I have met, I have encountered one \r\ncommon sentiment: a universal longing for peace and \r\nan aspiration to prosperity. \r\n But all too often I have discovered that people \r\nwho aspire to the same things also suffer from the same \r\nprejudices. They all fear that which is different from \r\nthem: the other ethnicity, the other skin colour, the \r\nother cultural or linguistic tradition and, above all, the \r\nother religion. \r\n And yet, in today’s era of global travel and \r\ninstant satellite transmissions, people everywhere are \r\nencountering less of the familiar and more of the other. \r\nThis reality has fed rising intercultural and \r\ninterreligious tensions, as well as growing alienation \r\namong vast segments of the world population. \r\n Today, there is an urgent need to address this \r\nworrying trend. We need to rebuild bridges and engage \r\nin a sustained and constructive intercultural dialogue, \r\none that stresses shared values and shared aspirations. \r\nIt is time to promote the idea that diversity is a virtue, \r\nnot a threat; it is time to explain that different \r\nreligions, belief systems and cultural backgrounds are \r\nessential to the richness of the human experience; and \r\nit is time to stress that our common humanity is \r\ngreater — far greater — than our outward differences. \r\n In short, it is time — indeed, it is past time — for \r\na constructive and committed dialogue: a dialogue \r\namong individuals, among communities and between \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n3 07-52846 \r\n \r\nnations. The General Assembly is a unique forum for \r\nsuch an exchange. Indeed, by bringing together \r\nrepresentatives of all countries under one roof, the \r\nAssembly provides a universal platform to reach out to \r\ndifferent nations and cultures.  \r\n Today’s gathering also comes at a particularly \r\nauspicious time, as Jews mark the celebration of the \r\nTorah and Muslims approach the end of the holy month \r\nof Ramadan. Such occasions remind us that men and \r\nwomen of faith around the world can be brought \r\ntogether, rather than separated, by their convictions and \r\ntheir belief in something greater than themselves. \r\n Last week, there was also a ministerial meeting of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, the United Nations \r\ninitiative to help build bridges and promote dialogue \r\nbetween cultures and religions. I was delighted to see \r\nhow membership of the Alliance of Civilizations had \r\nnearly doubled since the inaugural meeting a year ago. \r\nThat reflects the valuable work being performed by the \r\nAlliance under the leadership of His Excellency  \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio. But it also represents a growing \r\nresolve among nations to work together to heal divides \r\nin our world.  \r\n I draw strength from that resolve at a time when \r\nso many of the challenges we face are aggravated by \r\ndistrust and hostility. I also draw strength from \r\ngatherings such as this one. Looking around this Hall \r\ntoday, I feel that we are all united: we are united in our \r\nchoice of dialogue before confrontation; united in our \r\npursuit of engagement before alienation; united in our \r\nembrace of harmony and understanding. \r\n In that spirit, I wish all participants a most \r\nproductive meeting and look forward to the outcome of \r\ntheir discussions. \r\n The President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement.  \r\n Before proceeding further I would now like to \r\ndraw attention to a number of organizational matters \r\npertaining to the conduct of the meeting.  \r\n We turn first to the length of statements. In order \r\nto accommodate all the speakers on the list, I urge \r\nspeakers to adhere to the seven-minute time limit for \r\ntheir statements, on the understanding that that does \r\nnot preclude the distribution of more extensive written \r\ntexts. I earnestly appeal to speakers to cooperate in this \r\nrespect, so that all speakers can speak today and \r\ntomorrow. \r\n In order to assist speakers in managing their time, \r\na light system has been installed at the rostrum, which \r\nfunctions as follows: a green light will be activated at \r\nthe start of a speaker’s statement; an orange light will \r\nbe activated 30 seconds before the end of the seven \r\nminutes; and a red light will be activated when the \r\nseven-minute limit has elapsed. \r\n Before giving the floor to the first speaker, I \r\nwould like to note that I have been informed by the \r\ndelegation of Israel that, due to the Jewish holidays of \r\nShmini Atzeret/Simhat Torah and the last days of \r\nSukkot, which are being celebrated on 4 and 5 October, \r\nIsrael regrets its inability to participate in the High-\r\nLevel Dialogue and looks forward to joining future \r\ninterreligious and intercultural events.  \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Manuel de Castro, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof the Philippines. \r\n Mr. De Castro (Philippines): It is a great honour \r\nfor me to represent my country at the High-Level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace. As this is \r\nthe first time that I address the General Assembly, \r\nallow me, Mr. President, to convey to you my warmest \r\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election. May I \r\nalso convey my congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his maiden year at the helm of the United \r\nNations system. \r\n The promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue and cooperation has become a cornerstone of \r\nPhilippine policy for peace and development. It is not a \r\nnew concept for us, given that our history has been \r\nlargely shaped by cultural and religious diversity. Thus, \r\nthe highest law of our land — the Philippine \r\nconstitution — mandates the promotion and protection \r\nof the rights and welfare of all Filipinos, in particular \r\nthose of religious minorities and indigenous \r\ncommunities. \r\n As early as the 1960s, religious and grass-roots \r\norganizations and other civil society groups — \r\nparticularly in Muslim Mindanao, in the southern \r\nPhilippines — had already been engaged in the practice \r\nof interreligious and intercultural dialogue as an \r\neffective tool for peace. The national Government \r\ntherefore saw fit to enact laws and adopt measures to \r\nstrengthen and enhance the engagement of civil society \r\nin promoting economic and human development and \r\nthe peace process. \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 4 \r\n \r\n The 2004-2010 medium-term Philippine \r\ndevelopment plan, which is the framework for \r\ngovernance of the present Administration, values \r\ninterfaith dialogue, education and advocacy as \r\neffective tools for the conduct of healing and \r\nreconciliation programmes in conflict-affected \r\ncommunities. The 2006-2010 Philippine plan of action \r\non interfaith dialogue and cooperation strengthens \r\nGovernment and civil society partnership and \r\ncapacities in promoting interfaith dialogue and \r\nsolidarity, in particular in the areas of education and \r\ntraining, media advocacy, peace processes, poverty \r\nreduction, the promotion of human rights, \r\nenvironmental protection, the empowerment of women \r\nand anti-corruption efforts. \r\n In June of this year, our President created the \r\nNational Committee on Interfaith Cooperation to \r\nstrengthen the implementation of our Government’s \r\ninterfaith policy. Basic madrasa education has now \r\nbeen institutionalized in all public elementary schools \r\nthat have Muslim students. Moreover, a number of our \r\nuniversities are developing and incorporating peace \r\nstudies into their school curricula. Our Congress has \r\nalso passed the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997, \r\nwhich is recognized to be among the world’s strongest \r\nState-promulgated laws that respect and protect the \r\nfundamental freedoms and ways of life of indigenous \r\npeoples. Key development policies are thus in place in \r\nthe Philippines to provide an environment conducive to \r\nthe development of a vibrant culture of peaceful \r\ninterfaith communities, which has made it possible for \r\ncivil society groups to participate in development \r\nefforts at the national, local and community levels. \r\n The Philippine experience has demonstrated the \r\nsignificance of interfaith and intercultural dialogue in \r\npreventing conflicts and healing social wounds in \r\nconflict-stricken communities such as those in the \r\nsouthern Philippines. Interfaith dialogue has been \r\nfound to be essential in translating shared values of \r\npeace and respect into practical action at the grass-\r\nroots level. It offers a way out of the vicious circle of \r\nmistrust and conflict among religious and ethnic \r\ngroups, for two reasons. \r\n First, it provides a venue for building trust and \r\nrespect based on appreciation and acceptance of the \r\ncommon values and differences among religions, \r\ncultures and ethnicities. Secondly, it provides an \r\nopportunity to establish a common understanding of \r\nthe causes of armed conflicts affecting multi-ethnic and \r\nmulticultural communities such as those in the \r\nsouthern Philippines. That approach complements our \r\nGovernment’s efforts in resolving conflicts through its \r\ncomprehensive peace process, in which religious \r\nleaders and workers and various faith-based and \r\ninterfaith organizations are involved in peace \r\nnegotiations, the monitoring of ceasefire agreements \r\nand advocating for human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law. \r\n Our very own Bishops-Ulama Conference, which \r\nis recognized as the first of its kind in the world, \r\ncontinues to be a partner of Government in pursuing \r\nthe national peace agenda. That organization and many \r\nother interfaith groups form part of the civil society \r\nnetwork whose strength and support significantly \r\ndefine the outcome of the peace process. Along with \r\nthe business community, those groups are converging \r\nin building a dedicated peace constituency, in \r\nparticular by carving out zones of peace that bar armed \r\nconflict within delineated territories. \r\n Inspired by our achievements in promoting \r\ninterfaith dialogue and cooperation at home, in 2004 \r\nthe Philippines introduced an unprecedented General \r\nAssembly draft resolution on the promotion of \r\ninterreligious cooperation for peace. Adopted as \r\nresolution 59/23, it inspired the convening of the 2005 \r\nConference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace, which \r\nled to the holding of the 2005 summit, which was \r\nchaired by our President and which adopted the \r\nDeclaration on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for \r\nPeace.  \r\n As an offshoot of the Conference, in March 2006 \r\nthe Philippines launched the Tripartite Forum on \r\nInterfaith Cooperation for Peace, which is a platform \r\nfor collaboration supportive of the peace and \r\ndevelopment goals of the United Nations. The \r\nTripartite Forum has much to offer. I invite all \r\nGovernments that have not yet done so to join us in the \r\nTripartite Forum. \r\n The Philippines has also been active in promoting \r\ninterfaith dialogue at the regional level — promoting \r\ninterfaith dialogue at the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nGroup of 77, the Asia-Europe Meeting, the Regional \r\nForum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) and the Asia-Pacific Forum — all of which \r\nhave espoused that concept. Last year, the Philippines \r\nhosted the Cebu Dialogue on Regional Interfaith \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n5 07-52846 \r\n \r\nCooperation for Peace, Development and Human \r\nDignity.  \r\n This year, the Philippines co-sponsored the third \r\nAsia-Pacific Regional Interfaith Dialogue, which was \r\nheld in New Zealand, where over 150 participants from \r\nAsian and Pacific nations resolved to build bridges \r\namong faith communities and Governments to learn \r\nfrom each other’s experiences and promote peace and \r\nsecurity in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\n Last June, the Philippines co-sponsored the third \r\nAsia-Europe Meeting Interfaith Dialogue, which was \r\nheld in Nanjing, China, where 160 participating \r\ncountries vowed to deepen both government and civil \r\nsociety participation in the promotion and observance \r\nof interfaith dialogue for peace and development. The \r\nfourteenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in \r\nHavana in 2006 endorsed the offer of the Philippines to \r\nhost a NAM special meeting on interfaith dialogue and \r\ncooperation for peace in the Philippines in 2009, which \r\nwill include the participation of non-governmental \r\norganizations and the religious sector. \r\n Indeed, the present global, regional and national \r\npeace and security situation highlights the need for \r\ndeliberate, strategic and coordinated efforts in \r\ninterfaith dialogue and cooperation through \r\nstrengthened partnership between governments, the \r\nUnited Nations system and civil society. In that regard, \r\nmy delegation proposes the following ways forward. \r\nFirst, United Nations Member States would \r\ninstitutionalize interfaith and interreligious initiatives \r\nthrough policy and appropriate implementing \r\nmechanisms; in that regard, the Philippines puts \r\nforward as a model the Philippine national committee \r\non interfaith cooperation. Secondly, Member States \r\nwould uphold freedom of religion and strengthen their \r\nrespective mechanisms for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. Thirdly, Member States \r\nwould adopt a common plan of action and declare an \r\ninternational year of dialogue among religions and \r\ncultures. Fourthly, Member States would adopt policies \r\nand programmes to promote and protect the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples and would implement the United \r\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples. Fifthly, Member States would encourage \r\ninterfaith centres in schools of higher learning. Sixthly, \r\nthe United Nations would strengthen the newly \r\nestablished focal unit on interreligious, intercultural \r\nand intercivilizational matters to ensure that global, \r\nregional and national efforts towards promoting \r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue and cooperation \r\nfor peace are monitored, reported, sustained and \r\nsupported. \r\n The Philippines has played and will continue to \r\nplay an active role in the promotion of interfaith and \r\nintercultural dialogue and cooperation for peace, \r\ndevelopment and the protection of human dignity. We \r\nare committed to the urgent task of deepening \r\ncooperation and understanding between cultures, \r\nreligions and civilizations to eliminate racial tensions, \r\nmyths and prejudices that exacerbate conflicts and to \r\neffectively deal with global problems and issues. \r\n I would like to close with an appeal to everyone \r\npresent here today. Let us commit ourselves to work \r\nfor United Nations system-wide interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue and cooperation as an important \r\nmeans to pursue, build and sustain a culture of peace \r\nand let us remain aware of the positive contributions of \r\nfaith communities in the discharge of the respective \r\nmandates of the United Nations. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Munir Akram, chairman of the delegation of \r\nPakistan. \r\n Mr. Akram (Pakistan): This is a moment of \r\nimmense pleasure for me to be able to participate in the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace. The event is \r\nbeing organized as a follow-up to General Assembly \r\nresolution 61/221, which was jointly sponsored by \r\nPakistan and the Philippines. It is also the first high-\r\nlevel dialogue on the important issue of interfaith \r\ncooperation that has emerged as one of the greatest \r\nissues which faces the international community. \r\n The history of the last two millenniums proves \r\nthat all the major monotheistic religions of the \r\nworld — Judaism, Christianity and Islam — share a \r\ncommon heritage and converge on a multiplicity of \r\nuniversal values. The basic tenets of all religions and \r\ncultures are fundamentally similar: prescribing \r\nindivisible peace, dignity, honesty, equality, harmony, \r\ntolerance, cooperation, commitment, patience and \r\nfortitude. Throughout history, confrontation between \r\nfaiths and civilizations, when it has occurred, was \r\nmotivated by competing political or economic interests \r\nrather than incompatibility between the fundamental \r\nprecepts of any religion. \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 6 \r\n \r\n Today also, the manifestations of \r\nmisunderstanding and friction between cultures and \r\ncivilizations are not the result of religious differences. \r\nThey arise from divergent political perspectives on \r\ncertain important issues such as the crises in the \r\nMiddle East. \r\n The post-9/11 world has accentuated that \r\npolarization amongst communities belonging to \r\ndifferent faiths and religions. There are perceptions in \r\nthe West about Islam, which is portrayed by some as a \r\nfaith propagating terrorism and extremism and bent \r\nupon striking at the values of the Western world. The \r\nimage of Islam is further distorted by the role of some \r\nreligious and political extremists on both sides.  \r\n In the Muslim world, there is a general belief that \r\nthe West is deliberately suppressing or allowing the \r\nsuppression of Muslim peoples in Palestine, Iraq, \r\nKashmir and elsewhere. And it is felt at the popular \r\nlevel that freedom of expression is exploited as a \r\nweapon for the propagation and projection of insults \r\nand hate against Islam and its sacred symbols and \r\npersonalities. \r\n Islam is not a threat to Western civilization. It is a \r\nreligion of peace and submission. There have been \r\nnumerous instances throughout history where Muslims, \r\nChristians and Jews have lived together peacefully as \r\ncitizens in one State. Today Muslims should also be \r\nable to live in fraternity and freedom in Western \r\ncountries. As the British historian Karen Armstrong has \r\nstated, if we are to avoid catastrophe, the Muslim and \r\nWestern worlds must learn not merely to tolerate but to \r\nappreciate one another. \r\n It is Pakistan’s hope that the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations launched under the auspices of the United \r\nNations, can provide the organizational framework for \r\nthe adoption of a comprehensive strategy for action at \r\nthe international and national levels to promote \r\nunderstanding and cooperation between religions and \r\ncultures. Such a strategy should be inclusive involving \r\nGovernments, civil society, religious leaders, the \r\nprivate sector, media and international organizations. \r\n At the national level, each country should \r\npromote conscious action to counter extremism within \r\nits society. We must prohibit extremist organizations \r\nand hate literature, prevent the misuse of places of \r\nworship for the promotion of extremist views, prohibit \r\nthe defamation and denigration of religions and \r\nreligious personalities under the pretext of freedom of \r\nexpression, adopt appropriate reforms in educational \r\ncurricula to promote the correct interpretation of \r\nvarious faiths and cultures, initiate dialogue among our \r\nown people to build further understanding of the true \r\nspirit and values of their own faith as well as the major \r\nreligions and adopt conscious policies for the \r\nprotection of religious minorities. \r\n At the international level, a series of actions are \r\nrequired, such as sincere efforts to resolve major \r\ninternational disputes, especially where these involve \r\nfriction between different religions and faiths; the \r\npromotion of equitable socio-economic development \r\nand an end to the exploitation of the natural resources \r\nof developing countries; and the promotion of \r\nuniversal and multicultural education, inculcating \r\ngreater understanding of other religions and cultures. \r\nTo this end, one specific step we could take is the \r\nestablishment of a common school for the training of \r\nofficials and diplomats from nations representing \r\ndifferent faiths. Additionally, we could encourage \r\ngreater intercivilizational and interreligious exchanges \r\nand communication among Member States, including \r\nthrough the proper use of the Internet and other modern \r\ninformation technologies. Finally, in certain societies \r\nwhere migration has created a sudden mixture of faiths \r\nand cultures, we could launch conscious processes for \r\ngradual and peaceful integration, coexistence and \r\ncooperation. A start could be made in this direction \r\nwith adoption of confidence-building measures that can \r\novercome the hate and negative stereotypes that have \r\nsometimes been allowed to arise. \r\n It is not surprising that there are differences \r\nwithin and between societies, cultures, civilizations \r\nand religions. These differences and diversity should \r\nnot be the cause of confrontation. On the contrary, as \r\nthe Holy Quran says, “this ethnic diversity is only for \r\nthe sake of identity”.  \r\n Each one of us is a member of the same human \r\nfamily, with the same hopes and aspirations for a happy \r\nand positive life. Each human being must have the \r\nright and the opportunity to realize these hopes and \r\naspirations in accordance with his or her own values \r\nand beliefs, without coercion or intervention. For, as \r\nthe Holy Quran also says, and we in Islam believe, “a \r\nman’s faith is only between himself and God \r\nAlmighty”. \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n7 07-52846 \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Head of Government and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of San Marino. \r\n Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi (San Marino) (spoke in \r\nItalian; English text provided by the delegation): Let \r\nme start by expressing my most sincere appreciation \r\nfor this high-level meeting, which, together with the \r\ninitiatives of numerous United Nations agencies on the \r\ntopic of cultural diversity and projects, such as the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, highlight the urgent need to \r\npromote, within our societies, the strengthening of \r\ndialogue among cultures and religions and therefore, \r\nthe need for a commitment on the part of competent \r\ninstitutions and civil society to that dialogue. \r\n This commitment to the strengthening of dialogue \r\nis, indeed, the sine qua non required for overcoming \r\ndivision and mistrust and for building confidence and \r\nstrengthening cooperation within States and among \r\npeoples, which will, in turn, lead to the achieving of \r\nthe United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n The Republic of San Marino, which maintained \r\nthe promotion of intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue as the main priority of the programme during \r\nits six-month chairmanship of the Committee of \r\nMinisters of the Council of Europe, ending last May, \r\norganized a conference on the religious dimension of \r\nintercultural dialogue, with the representation of \r\ndiplomatic and religious representatives, researchers, \r\nand representatives of associations and the media from \r\nall over Europe. On this occasion, the representative of \r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General underlined the \r\ncurrent and urgent need to rebuild bridges and to be \r\ninvolved in a constant and constructive intercultural \r\ndialogue that promotes common values and shared \r\naspirations.  \r\n Indeed, the role that people of faith can play \r\nseems to be fundamental in that they represent the \r\nunderlying belief and ideal which belong to all great \r\nreligious traditions: compassion, solidarity, respect for \r\nlife and love for others, while calling on their believers \r\nto treat others as they themselves would like to be \r\ntreated. \r\n Additionally, on this occasion, the White Paper \r\non Intercultural Dialogue was also presented. This \r\ndocument will be published by the Council of Europe \r\nin 2008 — the very year the European Union has \r\ndedicated to intercultural dialogue. Furthermore, the \r\nCouncil of Europe entrusted San Marino with the \r\ncoordination of the first annual meeting dedicated to \r\nthe religious dimension of intercultural dialogue to be \r\nheld, on an experimental basis, in spring 2008 and with \r\nthe participation of the representatives of the 47 \r\nmember States, as well as representatives of religions \r\nand civil societies.  \r\n On the basis of this experience, my country \r\ndeems it clearly useful for international organizations, \r\nin addition to States, to multiply these occasions of \r\nmeeting and dialogue, which, first of all, strengthen \r\ntheir mutual cooperation to face the challenges and \r\nnew opportunities of cultural and religious diversity, \r\nand, secondly, provide them with new ideas, while \r\nlending momentum to the activities to be carried out by \r\neach of them. \r\n However, dialogue cannot be separated from \r\nrespect. Cultures and religions, both in terms of their \r\nexpressions and mutual relationships, must respect \r\nthose common values representing the very \r\nfoundations of coexistence within the international \r\ncommunity and cooperation among peoples. That is, \r\nrespect for human rights — which are universal, \r\nunalienable and indivisible — democratic rule, the rule \r\nof law and the principle of justice. \r\n Therefore, I share the assessments, concerns and \r\naspirations of the representatives of the countries and \r\nGovernments present here today. I note the complexity \r\nof the issues that increasingly characterizes our \r\nnational realities, involved as we all are in the process \r\nof globalization, and leads to claims and problems that \r\noften call for novel and urgent answers. We believe \r\ndialogue can decisively help us overcome fears, the \r\nrejection of others and the emergence of cultural or \r\nreligious discrimination, radicalism and violence. It \r\ncan help us respect the integrity of the individual and, \r\ntherefore, their practice of a faith or set of cultural \r\nvalues; a practice which, of course, must be a \r\nconscious and free choice.  \r\n Indeed, through dialogue, we can effectively \r\nstrengthen our civil and social contracts by promoting \r\nthe message of peace and dignity shared by various \r\nreligious identities while rejecting, at the same time, \r\ndistorted uses of religion.  \r\n At the national level, the participation and \r\nperiodic campaigns of specific issues promoted by \r\ninternational organizations, as well as the attention \r\npaid to particular themes, such as those promoted by \r\nthe United Nations, can serve as the engine for an \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 8 \r\n \r\nactivity that originates in our national reality and can \r\nthen spread in a incisive manner, involving different \r\ngroups, in particular youth, who remain the main target \r\nof our action. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to share a good wish \r\nwith all participants of this meeting. A small cave has \r\nbeen carved into the stone of Mount Titano, where the \r\nsmall and millenary Republic of San Marino is \r\nsituated. This space is devoted to meditation and prayer \r\nand open to all, regardless of their ideological or \r\nreligious beliefs. It provides a haven for meditation and \r\npeace, which have for centuries been the fundamental \r\nvalues of my country and the priority goal of its \r\nparticipation in international affairs.  \r\n However, even this small, rocky cave reflects the \r\nlight of the immense, universal message emanating \r\nfrom this Assembly, from which I take inspiration to \r\nwholeheartedly express the wish that, with the support \r\nof international cooperation and moments of \r\nsignificance such as this, the international community \r\ncan overcome the barrier of hostility in hearts and \r\nminds and allow space for open-mindedness, meeting \r\nand dialogue where the constructive purposes \r\ncharacterizing all our peoples can be pooled together to \r\nbuild a future of peace for all of humanity.  \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Vartan Oskanian, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nArmenia.  \r\n Mr. Oskanian (Armenia): An ancient people, \r\nserving as the perennial buffer between empires on the \r\nmost trampled path on earth, Armenians have become \r\nliving witnesses to the benefits of dialogue between \r\nand within cultures. We have been engaged in that \r\ninternational exchange for a very long time. Today, we \r\nin Armenia are among the greatest promoters of \r\ndialogue, especially in our immediate region. \r\n Our geography has compelled us to seek bridges \r\nwith peoples and cultures different from our own. If we \r\nhave an independent State today, it is because we \r\nsucceeded in perpetuating our identity even as we \r\ninteracted and exchanged with societies around us.  \r\n It is because of our experience that we feel \r\ncompelled to continually search for non-traditional \r\nways to approach the overarching issue of our time: \r\nliving at peace in a pluralist society. Not only have we \r\nlived in a pluralist society, we have, because of \r\ngenocide and dispersion, had to set up homes and \r\nshops in nearly every country on Earth. This began \r\nwhen Armenian genocide survivors were welcomed \r\nand happily integrated into the fabric of the Arab \r\nMiddle East. Religious differences did not preclude \r\ninclusion. Our diaspora, living as it did across borders, \r\nbecame both the means and the beneficiary of \r\ninternational exchange and dialogue. \r\n We are living witnesses then to the fact that \r\nreligious and linguistic differences need not translate to \r\nenmity and exclusion. It is intolerance, from its \r\nsimplest form to its most complex, and the consequent \r\nrejection of individuals’ human dignity, that causes \r\nruptures in and between societies. To build a peace \r\natop pain and destruction, it is clear that solutions can \r\nonly be found through the genuine and universal \r\nacceptance and application of basic and fundamental \r\nhuman rights, both individual and collective. \r\n Those rights include the right to determine one’s \r\ndestiny, to live free of security and oppression. The \r\nstruggle of our brothers and sisters in Nagorno \r\nKarabagh is exactly that: a struggle for the most basic \r\nhuman right — the right to live free. It is not a struggle \r\nagainst anyone’s religion or culture. The effort to seek \r\nsupport against their struggle by relying on ethnic and \r\nreligious solidarity belies the universality of their \r\nclaim, that people everywhere, whether Armenians \r\nfrom Nagorno Karabagh or Palestinians or the people \r\nof Darfur, all deserve to live in freedom and dignity. \r\n As societies which have experienced pain and \r\nsuffering at the hands of oppressors, we must teach and \r\nrely on the moral, ethical, social and political benefits \r\nof tolerance and cooperation. We must not feed the \r\nfears of otherness and exclusion. The frustrations, \r\nresentments and hostilities of victims of xenophobia \r\nand racism should not be underestimated or dismissed. \r\nThe security implications of pent-up anger, daily \r\nhumiliation and hopelessness cannot be exaggerated. \r\nWe must all be concerned by them, for reasons of \r\nprinciple as well as enlightened self-interest. \r\n Our objective is a country and a world where the \r\nrights of individuals and groups are respected, where \r\neach neighbourhood and community, each city and \r\ncountry and each region and continent are safe havens \r\nfor all who live or travel there. Religion is used to tear \r\npeople apart, as are economic disparities, language and \r\nideology. But the frustrating and fascinating \r\ncontradiction is that faith and humanity also bind \r\npeople together. \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n9 07-52846 \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, The Honourable \r\nAdviser for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh. \r\n Mr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Mr. President, \r\nmay I begin by applauding your stewardship of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and your leadership regarding the \r\ntopic we are dealing with today. I also applaud the \r\nenthusiasm of the Secretary-General in this respect and \r\nhis stimulating introductory remarks. I congratulate \r\nPakistan and the Philippines for their initiative, to \r\nwhich Bangladesh accords unswerving support.  \r\n The present age of globalization poses a myriad \r\nof challenges. At the same time it opens up \r\nopportunities for the promotion of cultural diversity. \r\nInteractions among States and other actors have \r\nsubstantially increased over the past decade. They have \r\nalso enhanced the scope for cooperation, \r\ncomplementarities and fulfilment of mutual interests. \r\nThey have increased the potential for both cohesion \r\nand clash. Sadly, mistrust, suspicion, prejudice and \r\nmisperception of the “other” continue to persist. \r\nVarious new manifestations of intolerance towards \r\nvulnerable groups, ethnic and religious minorities, \r\nimmigrants, refugees and migrant workers are on the \r\nrise. \r\n We have witnessed the proliferation of extremism \r\nand racism. Millions have been rendered victims of \r\nreligious and ethnic profiling or cultural intolerance. \r\nThis situation has further been exploited by certain \r\ngroups in order to widen the gap between various \r\nreligions and faiths. Religious and cultural intolerance \r\nand disrespect are based on a false notion of supremacy \r\nof one religion or culture over others. This attitude \r\nfosters hatred, mistrust and exclusion. Eventually it \r\nleads to social, economic and political disparities and \r\npolarization in society.  \r\n We are convinced that people can overcome \r\nhatred through proper education that inculcates a \r\nculture of peace. Education is also essential for \r\nspreading better understanding and harmony. The State \r\nhas a responsibility for removing hatred and \r\nintolerance and for protecting the citizens from \r\ndiscrimination. Building institutions, enacting \r\nappropriate laws and cultivating mutual respect can \r\nhelp establish a society of religious and communal \r\nharmony. The civil society along with the Government \r\ncan and indeed must play a very crucial role towards \r\nthis end. The media can also make a significant \r\ncontribution towards raising awareness against such \r\ndiscrimination and intolerance and can bring to the fore \r\nthe fact that humanity transcends all.  \r\n Peace is not simply the absence of war. Neither is \r\nit only the absence of violence and insecurity. \r\nSustained peace is accompanied and must be \r\naccompanied by progress and development, by which \r\nwe mean poverty eradication, rule of law, adherence to \r\ndemocratic principles and pluralism, dissemination of \r\nproper education, empowerment of women and the \r\nlike.  \r\n Bangladesh believes in this context that \r\ninternational cooperation is a precondition for the \r\npursuit of global peace, security and development. We \r\nstress that such international cooperation must be based \r\non social inclusion, equality and equity, human dignity \r\nand justice. It is, therefore, necessary to promote better \r\nunderstanding among various religions, beliefs and \r\ncultures. It is also desirable to spread the message of \r\nuniversal respect for cultures and religions by all and \r\nfor all. The United Nations can play a catalytic role in \r\nthat noble endeavour. \r\n The challenge before us is to transform the \r\ndiversity of cultures, religions, traditions and customs \r\ninto a unifying force. That force can contain the \r\nproliferation of ethnic, religious and civil conflicts. It \r\ncan also eliminate the existing sense of insecurity and \r\nfear. In the final analysis, it can contribute to the global \r\ntransition from a culture of war to a culture of peace. \r\nIndeed, each year Bangladesh submits to the General \r\nAssembly a draft resolution on a culture of peace, \r\nwhich gains the overwhelming support of member \r\nStates. We shall do the same during the current session, \r\nand we look forward to the same level of support.  \r\n Bangladesh has always played an important role \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nOur commitment to United Nations peacekeeping as a \r\nmajor troop-contributing country remains unwavering. \r\nWith the growing mandate of peacekeeping operations, \r\npeacebuilding responsibilities — which include many \r\nof the subjects we are talking about today — now play \r\nimportant role in post-conflict situations. We believe \r\nthat the promotion of tolerance and cultural diversity \r\ncan substantially reduce conflict and crime. We also \r\nunderscore the importance of inclusion of the culture \r\nof peace in the operational activities of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. In our own country, \r\nBangladesh, followers of different faiths live in a state \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 10 \r\n \r\nof tranquil harmony, as we have managed to inculcate \r\nin our people a sense of tolerance and respect for \r\ndiversity. \r\n The great religions and faiths of the world profess \r\nand promote the same values. These relate to the \r\nsanctity of human life, peace, justice and tolerance. Is \r\nthat too tall an order or too high an aim for humanity to \r\nconform to? I do not think so. Earlier today when you \r\nspoke, Sir, you quoted from Dante Alighieri, that great \r\nItalian writer of the Renaissance. Another great poet \r\nsaid, and said very aptly that man’s reach should \r\nexceed his grasp, for what else are the heavens for?  \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nThe Honourable S. K. Boafo, Minister for Chieftaincy \r\nand Culture of Ghana. \r\n Mr. Boafo (Ghana): It is a privilege for me to \r\nparticipate in this very important meeting to engage in \r\ndialogue on interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace. In view of \r\nglobalization, every nation should strive for peaceful \r\ncoexistence with every other. The importance of \r\ndialogue on issues that can create peace cannot be \r\nunderestimated. \r\n Modern pluralistic societies, if they wish to \r\nensure peace and preserve the well-being of their \r\ncitizens, cannot afford to pay the price of cultural and \r\nreligious monologue or cultural and religious \r\nfundamentalism. In this technological era, when \r\ndistances between continents have become \r\ninsignificant and when the populations of many \r\ncountries have acquired a multinational and multi-\r\nethnic character, the development of a democratic \r\nsociety is impossible without enabling each citizen to \r\nintegrate his or her values and principles with the \r\nvalues of other cultural and religious groups. \r\n Certain values and principles are universally \r\nshaped and cut across all civilizations, be they Western, \r\nEuropean, Asian or African, in establishing a sense of \r\nhuman community. They propound basic truths and \r\nstandards of behaviour that constitute the very basis of \r\nsocial cohesion and collective efforts. Any dialogue \r\nmust therefore focus on the importance of shared \r\nvalues which give meaning to life and provide form \r\nand substance to identities. It must also foster respect \r\nfor the other and acknowledge and uphold diversity.  \r\n In situations of major social and economic \r\ntransformation, often induced by the consequences of \r\nglobalization, the constant promotion and renewed \r\nawareness of ethical principles and human rights are of \r\nkey importance. I am therefore happy to inform the \r\nAssembly that the 1992 constitution of Ghana \r\nrecognized the key issue of human rights which is \r\nmanifested in its preamble.  \r\n Intercultural and interreligious contacts and \r\nexchanges open new opportunities for societies to \r\nbetter understand others and themselves. Such \r\ninteraction is therefore an integral feature of and \r\nprecondition for social progress and peacebuilding. \r\nThis High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace \r\nis an opportune forum for all of us, especially in this \r\nera, when the world is embroiled in inter-ethnic, \r\nintercultural and interreligious conflicts. It is expected \r\nthat this Dialogue will assist countries that have such \r\nchallenges to find lasting solutions and deepen their \r\nunderstanding in that respect. \r\n Having expressed my country’s support for this \r\nDialogue, I wish to share a few experiences from \r\nGhana which have created a sense of peaceful \r\ncoexistence and harmony among our varied cultures \r\nand religions. That has been achieved through the \r\npromotion of respect for values and attitudes and \r\npolicies based on mutual respect, understanding and \r\nnon-discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, faith or \r\nother cultural characteristics. \r\n Our diverse culture has its roots in our institution \r\nof chieftaincy, which plays a vital function in \r\npeacebuilding and partnering with Government to \r\ncreate peace within our communities. Our chiefs \r\nextend compassion to everyone, irrespective of faith, \r\nculture or origin. Our traditional values are also geared \r\ntowards sustaining and protecting the environment, \r\nwhich sometimes involves issues that create recipes for \r\nconflicts. \r\n In Ghana, all the religious institutions team up \r\nwith the Government to create a peaceful environment \r\nfor our people. The communication machinery, be it \r\ngovernmental or private, allows different faiths and \r\ncultures to utilize its facilities without any hindrance.  \r\n Despite the different cultures existing in Ghana, \r\nthere is always unity in diversity in everything that our \r\npeople do. Therefore, Government has little to grapple \r\nwith in the area of conflicts among the cultures and \r\nreligions that are a common denominator in our lives. \r\nCulture and religion have blended so well that it is \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n11 07-52846 \r\n \r\ndifficult to identify the lines of division. For instance, \r\ntraditional music, drumming and dancing are common \r\npractices in our churches, which are mostly of the \r\nWestern tradition. It behoves all countries, in particular \r\nthose that have interreligious and intercultural \r\nchallenges, to learn from other countries and regions \r\nthat have successfully managed religions among \r\ncultures and regions.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Tarek Mitri, Minister of Culture and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Emigrants of \r\nLebanon. \r\n Mr. Mitri (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): First, I \r\nwish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \r\nassumption of your new and responsible task. I also \r\nwish to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General \r\nand to your predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed  \r\nAl-Khalifa. My thanks go also to the delegations of the \r\nPhilippines and Pakistan for all of the efforts they have \r\nmade.  \r\n Interest in this subject is increasing due to \r\nrepeated initiatives on the subject, and because of the \r\ndifficulties that arise in relations among nations and the \r\ndangers and fears caused by ignorance in the face of \r\npolicies that manipulate religious symbols, emotions \r\nand cultural characteristics in the fight for power. \r\nBecause of their extremism, such policies force us to \r\nassert our identity and individualism and to feel \r\nhostility towards others, whether they be near or far \r\naway.  \r\n The international community’s interest in \r\ndialogue has intensified as a result of concern about \r\nnew and renewed phenomena characterized by \r\nreligious and ethnic violence, terrorism, intimidation \r\nand disinformation intended to slander and humiliate \r\nothers. Efforts have been made to improve \r\nunderstanding, but such efforts should not be the \r\nprovince of our elites; rather, they should be the work \r\nof society as a whole. This problem must be addressed \r\nurgently, not just over the long term.  \r\n Over the past two decades, against a background \r\nof tension and confrontation, attempts have been made \r\nto address fanaticism and extremism and to find \r\npeaceful solutions to conflicts. The increased demand \r\nfor dialogue among intellectuals and adherents of \r\nvarious religions encourages us to wonder whether its \r\npromises are realistic. We must promote such \r\ninitiatives on the basis of two perspectives: credibility \r\nand effectiveness. Credibility means not only good \r\nintentions, but also the capacity to be serious and to be \r\nrespected by the broadest majority of people. \r\nObviously, effectiveness does not mean immediate \r\nchange; rather, it means tangible effects on mindsets, \r\nfeelings and attitudes and, indirectly, on the \r\ndevelopment of relationships and events.  \r\n We must also be more specific in defining the \r\ngoals of dialogue so that we can highlight its value and \r\nagree on its rules. Dialogue, like culture and religion, \r\nhas many meanings. That is why it lends itself to a \r\nmultitude of uncoordinated and sometimes divergent \r\nefforts. Lebanon has been dealing with this issue, \r\nbecause we have made dialogue part of our national \r\nconsciousness. Our country’s message is that we attach \r\ngreat importance to dialogue, although we have not \r\nalways succeeded in building the confidence of \r\nLebanese citizens in dialogue’s capacity to strengthen \r\ncitizenship, equality, respect for diversity and \r\ncoexistence, to which our constitution refers several \r\ntimes. \r\n At this time of religious and political division and \r\ntensions — whatever the reasons behind them may \r\nbe — we are facing challenges as a result of the \r\ndialogue of life. Those challenges pose difficulties for \r\nus in our attempts to preserve our unity and diversity. \r\nEnsuring unity in the areas of culture and politics can \r\nthreaten the richness of our diversity and our ability to \r\nbenefit from that richness. Sometimes we fear that \r\ndiversity threatens our national identity and allegiance; \r\nsuch fear leads to alienation. Thus, we must always \r\nchoose the potential offered by dialogue, which is \r\nsometimes lacking in situations of confrontation.  \r\n Dialogue is not a search for agreement at any \r\ncost; it requires that we accept and embrace difference \r\nand that we put it in its proper context, rather than \r\neither minimizing or exaggerating it. Dialogue does not \r\neliminate rivalry or confrontation, but proposes a way \r\nto organize those elements without succumbing to an \r\nendless negotiating process. Negotiation is limited by \r\npower relationships, while dialogue helps to liberate us \r\nfrom them and to change and sometimes even \r\nrestructure them by putting the parties on an equal \r\nfooting. Dialogue opens the door that we close when \r\npeople are reduced to a single category, mould and \r\nidentity, whereas identities are in fact interlocked and \r\ndiverse. \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 12 \r\n \r\n In Lebanon and other countries, the idea has \r\narisen that religious and cultural groups have \r\nharmonious personalities and unique characteristics. \r\nIndividuals have an idealized image of their own \r\ncommunities in comparison with those of others. Thus, \r\nthe differences of others are seen as flaws and defects. \r\nThe essence of the group is personified in the \r\nindividual. That justifies reduced accountability when \r\nreprehensible acts are committed by those who belong \r\nto the same religious community or nationality, even if \r\nthey live far away. Thus, violence — whether real or \r\nsymbolic — spreads. Distant conflicts can thus affect \r\nrelationships between neighbours. Several countries, \r\nincluding my own, face that danger, which serves the \r\npolitical purposes of foreign interference and runs \r\ncounter to the common interest of the national \r\ncommunity. Our experience has shown us that dialogue \r\nis credible and effective and that it can promote the \r\nautonomy of individuals, particularly at difficult times \r\nof ideological mobilization. Dialogue enables us to \r\nmove away from intimidation and provides an \r\nalternative path of differing points of view. Dialogue \r\nenables us to put out the fires ignited by various \r\nconflicts.  \r\n The United Nations and its agencies have \r\nembarked on various initiatives and programmes that \r\nthe General Assembly adopted last year. We are \r\nseeking to expand the number of participants in these \r\nexchanges of views and to encourage dialogue and \r\nunderstanding. But we must not stop there. Dialogue is \r\na language, a culture and a paradigm for \r\ncommunications; it is not limited to intellectuals or \r\nreligious dignitaries. Dialogue involves us all, \r\nparticularly the media and politicians. Their \r\nstatements, news stories and images often emphasize \r\nsensationalism and generalizations rather than \r\nproviding explanations and details.  \r\n For many people, particularly those living in \r\ndiverse societies, genuine and effective dialogue \r\nremains the alternative to clashes of ignorance, which \r\ndraw borders of blood between religions, cultures, \r\ncountries and regions. The United Nations has \r\nunderstood what is at stake; we are all confronting this \r\nrenewed challenge with respect to religious, moral and \r\ncultural values. We must recall that when we choose \r\ndialogue and its culture, we respect the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n I should like to close by noting that Lebanon’s \r\nclose relationship with the United Nations ensures that \r\nthe Organization will not forget our country and will \r\nfocus on Lebanon’s defence of its freedom, \r\nindependence and stability. Thus, Lebanon can remain \r\nfaithful to its role as a witness to the richness and \r\nvitality of this dialogue among various religions and \r\ncultures. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Nitya Pibulsonggram, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Thailand. \r\n Mr. Pibulsonggram (Thailand): Sixty-two years \r\nago, our predecessors, inspired by a shared aspiration \r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of \r\nconflict, created this institution, the United Nations, on \r\nthe basis of a common faith: faith in the ability of \r\nhumanity to resolve its differences peacefully. That \r\nfaith is based fundamentally on the following belief: \r\nthat differences, whether in ideas or in values, in \r\npolitical systems or in cultural heritage, are not barriers \r\nto cooperation; and that differences need not be feared, \r\nbut rather should be celebrated, as they reflect the rich \r\ndiversity of humanity, of civilization and of history. \r\nOur United Nations was founded to promote respect \r\nfor this diversity among nations, to promote \r\ncooperation between countries, despite differences, for \r\nthe betterment of humanity as a whole. \r\n Today, this Organization — indeed, this \r\ngeneration — faces a great challenge, one posed by a \r\nrising culture of intolerance and extremism, of \r\ndisrespect and violence. For some, this is being \r\nperceived as no less than an impending clash among \r\ncivilizations. But whatever it is called, this \r\nphenomenon is the very antithesis of what the United \r\nNations stands for, because it challenges the very \r\nnotion of respect for the diversity of humanity. We \r\ncannot let this come to pass. \r\n There are many causes for this rising intolerance \r\nand lessening of mutual respect, ranging from a \r\nperceived sense of injustice to misunderstandings or \r\nmiscommunication. Many times this intolerance, this \r\nviolence, is propagated by the few to misguide the \r\nmany in order to bring harm to them, or harm to all. \r\nFor some, it involves portraying a problem as a \r\nreligious conflict where in fact there is none. Indeed, \r\nthis is what some are trying to do in my own country, \r\nThailand, and they have failed utterly. No one believes \r\nthem. \r\n Such intolerance, whatever the cause may be, if \r\nnot addressed, will likely exacerbate misunderstanding. \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n13 07-52846 \r\n \r\nThis could lead to distrust, to disagreement and, of \r\ncourse, to dispute. We cannot let this happen.  \r\n For all these reasons and more, the convening of \r\nthis High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace \r\nis as timely as it is necessary. Here, I wish to commend \r\nthe Philippines and Pakistan for their pivotal role in \r\nhelping to realize this important meeting, because now \r\nis the time. It is the time for the moderate majority, for \r\nthose who believe in tolerance and respect for \r\ndiversity, to speak out and take action. \r\n The question before us is: what is the best way to \r\nachieve this? How do we move from noble ideas to \r\nconcrete action? How do we feasibly promote greater \r\nrespect for cultural diversity and tolerance in our \r\nsocieties and between societies? How do we inculcate a \r\nculture of peace in our countries and around the world? \r\n We ourselves will have to take the first step, \r\nwithin our own countries and within our respective \r\nregions. In the Kingdom of Thailand, our new \r\nConstitution continues to protect and to promote \r\nreligious freedoms, with our Monarch serving as \r\nDefender of all Faiths. Interfaith dialogue is organized \r\nby local religious leaders to address common problems \r\nshared by people of various faiths in the same \r\ncommunity — problems such as environmental \r\ndegradation, for example. \r\n In our region of South-East Asia we have \r\ncountries that are predominantly Muslim, Christian and \r\nBuddhist, all working together to building an \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations community \r\nwhere diversity is considered to be a source of \r\nstrength. Each nation, each region, will identify its own \r\nbest means to promote tolerance and respect for \r\ndiversity, in a manner that reaches out to the grass \r\nroots. This is not something that can be imposed from \r\nwithout, least of all by the United Nations; but it is \r\nsomething that can be encouraged, because tolerance \r\nand respect for diversity are universal values, \r\nbeneficial to all, detrimental to none — save for those \r\nwho stand to lose, such as extremists. \r\n The second step is to identify critical target \r\ngroups to determine the critical instruments that can \r\nhelp accelerate the momentum of support for a culture \r\nof peace and tolerance. Here, I believe the key target \r\ngroup is youth, and the key instrument is education — \r\nan education that inculcates tolerance and respect for \r\nthe values of other cultures and faiths, a curriculum \r\nthat promotes understanding of different cultures while \r\npromoting pride in one’s own, and also an exchange \r\nprogramme that enables youths to be exposed to \r\npeoples of different cultures and beliefs, whether in \r\ntheir own countries or beyond. \r\n We have tried using these tools in our own \r\ncountry. A new course on all the religions in Thailand \r\nis being designed, with a view to enhancing tolerance \r\nin our pluralistic society. Exchange programmes to \r\nbring our youths of one religion to live in communities \r\nbelonging to another religion, as well as in other \r\ncountries, are being implemented. \r\n The third step is to coordinate and consolidate \r\nour various efforts at the global level to promote \r\nrespect for diversity and tolerance. There are many \r\nimportant initiatives in this regard, and they all have \r\ngreat added value. But we can always seek to avoid \r\nduplication of efforts. \r\n General Assembly resolution 61/221 on this \r\nissue, which Thailand co-sponsored, requests the \r\nSecretary-General to ensure the systematic and \r\norganizational follow-up on all such initiatives within \r\nthe United Nations framework. In his report dated \r\n25 September 2007 (A/62/337), the Secretary-General \r\nhas taken an important first step by compiling activities \r\nundertaken under these initiatives, including the \r\nimportant contributions by UNESCO. Perhaps further \r\nefforts would also include interfacing with similar \r\ninitiatives outside the United Nations, including \r\nregional and interregional initiatives. \r\n No peace among humankind can long endure if \r\ncultural and civilizational fault lines are allowed to \r\nform and to deepen. No progress for humanity can be \r\nsustained for long if trust and tolerance are \r\novershadowed by misunderstanding and hatred, \r\nbecause the threat of religious intolerance, the danger \r\nof intercultural conflict, can emanate from not only \r\nbetween civilizations and countries but also from \r\nwithin nations and societies. Such intolerance, such \r\nconflict, whether between countries or within nations, \r\nare unacceptable. \r\n It is thus up to us, women and men of goodwill, \r\nto see to it that a culture of peace and a culture of \r\ntolerance prevail and flourish. It is up to us, the \r\nMember States of the United Nations, to see to it that a \r\ncore value of this Organization — respect for \r\ndiversity — is nurtured and sustained. For only through \r\ngoodwill among nations, understanding among peoples \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 14 \r\n \r\nand concerted action among Member States, all based \r\non mutual respect, can we be assured that the challenge \r\nposed by intolerance and extremism will be \r\nsurmounted. \r\n In this important task, we cannot afford to fail. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Sven Alkalaj, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n Mr. Alkalaj (Bosnia and Herzegovina): It is my \r\ngreat pleasure and honour to be here with you today \r\nand I take this opportunity to express my sincere \r\ngratitude to the President of the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Governments of the \r\nPhilippines and Pakistan for convening this meeting on \r\nsuch an important topic.  \r\n Dialogue, respect and coexistence are the three \r\nkeys words for a better world and a sustainable future, \r\nwhere reconciliation will lead to the termination of \r\nconflict and overcoming the “us vs. them” mentality, \r\nleading us into a world of tolerance, peace and true \r\nprosperity. From the whole range of cultures and \r\npeoples around the world and the whole range of \r\nreligions and attitudes found on our planet to the \r\nextraordinary multiplicity of the natural world, we \r\ndepend on diversity. \r\n Diversity is the real spice of our lives and has \r\nbecome a factor much sought after and, at the same \r\ntime, much feared. Recognizing of our common \r\ndestiny as human beings can help us overcome the \r\n“us vs. them” mentality. Unity and diversity must be \r\nour common goal.  \r\n But how do we reach this goal? The United \r\nNations has provided an excellent forum for the \r\nexchange of views on how to attain this goal. Through \r\nthe constant activity of its main bodies and many \r\ninitiatives, the United Nations provides guidelines and \r\nadditional impetus to Member States, encouraging \r\nthem to pursue, in their activities and efforts, the \r\npromotion of tolerance and understanding, as well as \r\nuniversal respect for religious and cultural diversity.  \r\n Dialogue among civilizations, cultures and \r\nreligions has great potential for aiding conflict \r\nprevention on the international, national and local \r\nlevels by reducing misunderstanding and mistrust and \r\nby laying the foundations for the non-violent resolution \r\nof conflict. It also has enormous potential for solving \r\ncurrent and future political, social and economic \r\nproblems by encouraging people to share their \r\nexperiences, knowledge, trust and all the beautiful \r\nexpressions and content of the real spice of our life, \r\nnamely, diversity. \r\n The need for dialogue between cultures and \r\nreligions has become a fact of life. Respect for all \r\nthings that are different from ourselves and from our \r\nown system of values can help in understanding these \r\nthings as well as other people’s visions of the future, \r\ntheir core beliefs and the content of their lives. The \r\nvalues and viewpoints of one’s own civilization, \r\nculture, religion and system must not be taken as \r\nabsolute and universal. Only once this view is adopted \r\ncan we really be sure that the ground has been laid for \r\ndialogue and for hope for a better, violence-free world.  \r\n People from all over the world, with all kinds of \r\ndifferent ethnic and religious backgrounds, work, learn \r\nand live together every day. That is the environment \r\nthat makes tolerance important and brings about an \r\nappreciation of diversity. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of those places at \r\nthe crossroad between East and West, North and South. \r\nIt is just like a small world. Christianity, Islam and \r\nJudaism are all found in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We \r\nare almost a bridge between civilizations. It is here that \r\nWestern rationality meets Eastern sentiment, ultimately \r\nmaking Bosnia and Herzegovina such a wonderful and \r\nvibrant community. \r\n For centuries in Bosnia and Herzegovina, people \r\nlived not only side by side with one another — \r\nMuslims, Jews, Christians — but lived as one with one \r\nanother. Abundant proof of this coexistence can be \r\nfound in every step you take in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina: in its culture, literature, architecture — \r\neverywhere. In our capital, Sarajevo, you can find \r\nwithin a 200 metres circle, a synagogue, a mosque and \r\nCatholic and Orthodox churches that have been \r\nstanding next to each other since the fifteenth century, \r\nalmost leaning on each other and supporting one \r\nanother, without being inconvenienced by the other in \r\nany way. \r\n Such a rich cultural heritage in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, with its diversity of cultures, religions \r\nand people, ultimately enriches our lives. Children \r\ngrow up aware of differences, but they are taught \r\ntolerance and respect for their friends and \r\nneighbours — a lesson that has been passed down from \r\ngeneration to generation. \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n15 07-52846 \r\n \r\n It is important to instil those same values in \r\nchildren around the world. They are the future, and \r\nteaching them tolerance, respect and appreciation for \r\ncultures and religions will prove as important as \r\nteaching them writing and the basics of mathematics. \r\nBut teaching our children will mean nothing, if we do \r\nnot lead by our example.  \r\n Many preach tolerance and respect, but it cannot \r\nsimply end with preaching. To take the next step and \r\npractice what we preach is what needs to be done. \r\nReligious groups and religious leaders around the \r\nworld have a very important duty when it comes to \r\ninterreligious and intercultural cooperation. \r\nInterreligious dialogue as a dimension of intercultural \r\ncommunication will have reached its full potential \r\nwhen a priest in a church, an imam in a mosque and a \r\nrabbi in a synagogue talk to each other and work with \r\neach other, conveying a common message, a message \r\nof tolerance, respect and mutual understanding. \r\n Religious communities have enormous potential \r\nto become a positive force for peace and tolerance by \r\nmaking it clear that an attack against one faith is an \r\nattack against all faiths. Such collaboration and \r\ndialogue based on mutual respect represents key \r\ninstruments for improving relations and cooperation \r\namong peoples and countries. \r\n Nowadays, more than ever, people in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina are fully aware that there will be no \r\nprosperous future without true reconciliation, \r\ntolerance, mutual respect and understanding. Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, with its experience and history, can \r\nfully contribute to a dialogue between cultures and \r\nreligions. On the international level, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina is very proud of its Interreligious Council \r\nand its tremendous potential for the future. A \r\nmagnificent venue for cooperation, collaboration and \r\ndialogue, this interreligious body, together with \r\nreligious communities, can help us to live together \r\npeacefully and constructively in a multicultural world.  \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina has reached many of its \r\ngoals. We are determined to reach all of them. We are \r\ndedicated to building a praiseworthy society with the \r\nhighest of ethical norms based on dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and acceptance. We are armed with \r\ncourage to face the differences and diversities of \r\nothers. We cooperate interreligiously and \r\ninterculturally, we cooperate for peace.  \r\n To share and discuss points of view on such \r\nmatters is necessary and important, but unfortunately, \r\nnot enough. Education, from the youngest age, is a \r\nprerequisite for a better life and future. Our ultimate \r\nchallenge seems to be to educate a new generation \r\ncapable of building a new spirit, one which accepts and \r\nrespects diversity, capable of accepting rather than \r\nexcluding, forgiving rather than hating. \r\n We all know that it has always been easy to point \r\nout differences among ourselves. What we must do, \r\nhowever, is to focus on what we have in common and \r\nrealize that we are bound by those commonalities. \r\nThen, when it comes to our differences, we can learn \r\nthat they are not obstacles in our lives, but something \r\nto appreciate. We must not only respect our \r\ndifferences, but we must learn how to make use of \r\nthem, how to learn from each other and how to \r\nappreciate that which differentiates us. \r\n The time has come to move beyond just \r\ntolerance. Diversity is not something to be endured, but \r\nrather it is something that we, as a society, must \r\nactively engage ourselves in every day. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Agustin Komoe, Minister of Culture and la \r\nFrancophonie of Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n Mr. Komoe (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): It \r\nis an honour for me to address this Assembly to discuss \r\nunderstanding among religions and cultures, and \r\ncooperation for peace.  \r\n This subject is of great importance for my \r\ncountry, Côte d’Ivoire, which is a nation-State of West \r\nAfrica on the Gulf of Guinea, covering 322,000 square \r\nkilometres. Côte d’Ivoire is an ethnic mosaic of more \r\nthan 60 ethnicities, which can be classified into four \r\nmain groups. With a population of 16 million, we host \r\nbetween 4 and 5 million foreigners — almost one third \r\nof the population, a case almost unique in the world.  \r\n Linguistically, our country offers diversity just as \r\ngreat, counting some 70 languages, even though the \r\nofficial language and the language used in schools is \r\nFrench.  \r\n Turning to religion, Côte d’Ivoire offers to the \r\nworld a model of syncretism and peaceful interfaith \r\ncoexistence. There is no majority religion in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. More than one third of Ivorians are Muslims, \r\n22 per cent are Christians and 17 per cent of our \r\npopulation has remained faithful to traditional or \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 16 \r\n \r\nnon-revealed religions, which have had a considerable \r\ninfluence on the other beliefs. Lastly, 17 per cent of \r\nIvorians have chosen other religious faiths.  \r\n So far, coexistence between these various \r\nreligions has not led to any major conflict. Each citizen \r\npractices his faith while strictly observing freedom of \r\nworship and the secular nature of the State. \r\nFurthermore, the motto and the national anthem of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire emphasize the virtues of work, \r\ndiscipline, union and hospitality.  \r\n The same goes for our constitution, which \r\nemphatically stresses respect for freedoms and the need \r\nfor a civic life underpinned by democracy. How can \r\none not mention inter-ethnic alliances that are veritable \r\nsocial cement, serving as covenants between peoples \r\nand ethnic groups? When these alliances take place in a \r\nfamily setting, they are the subject of friendly banter. \r\nThese agreements seal the social contract among the \r\ncommunities involved.  \r\n Therefore, the nation is rebuilding and is \r\ngradually reducing its difficult toll of divisions from \r\nthe past. Our rich and diversified cultural heritage calls \r\nupon citizens to own their traditions and customs in \r\norder to better participate in the dialogue of cultures \r\nand in the affirmation of their Ivorian cultural \r\nexception.  \r\n The military and political crisis that we are \r\ngradually but resolutely emerging from has reaffirmed \r\nthe importance of solidarity at the national, regional \r\nand global scales. The Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States, the West African Economic and \r\nMonetary Union and the United Nations have helped \r\nIvorians throughout our social crisis, which could have \r\nbecome irreparable, contributing greatly to limiting the \r\nharmful effects of the crisis. The attitude of the United \r\nNations in view of the Ouagadougou Accord, as well as \r\nthe conclusive results, show the need to help in the \r\nresolution of conflicts while remaining attentive to the \r\nfundamental needs of the players.  \r\n The Ivorian crisis — the problems as well as the \r\nprocess of resolving them — is an obvious example of \r\nthe consubstantial and incompressible nature of our \r\ncultural exception and of the dialogue of cultures in \r\nour quest for peace and sustainable development \r\nthrough multilateral cooperation. This is why Côte \r\nd’Ivoire is pleased that it ratified the conventions and \r\nprotocols that should give the world the proper \r\ndefences essential for making them long-term.  \r\n Côte d’Ivoire also wants all peoples to be \r\nconvinced that the culture of human abilities is more \r\nthan traditions. Because of their identifying and \r\neconomic dimensions, cultural products express the \r\ncreative vitality of peoples and contribute to \r\ndemocratic awareness and social cohesion. That is why \r\nthose who use violence, sometimes in the name of \r\nreligion, seriously betray that message. We need to get \r\nout of this spiral of distrust, intolerance and violence, \r\nand restore religions in their ethic dimensions. \r\nFurthermore, if people who are culturally or religiously \r\ndifferent overcome their distrust and exchange it for \r\nmutual human values, they will discover the extent to \r\nwhich they share and live with common values.  \r\n Côte d’Ivoire is made up of distinct communities, \r\neach with its own exclusive cultural characteristics. \r\nAccordingly, a citizen’s feeling of belonging and of \r\ncultural identity often depends on his degree of \r\nfamiliarity with the cultural characteristics of his own \r\ncommunity and those of others.  \r\n Consequently, our Government’s policy helps \r\npeople become familiar with the characteristics of the \r\nsociety of which they are a part and, in doing so, \r\nstrengthens their feeling of belonging and cultural \r\nidentity. Accordingly the Ministry of Culture seeks, \r\ninter alia, to promote the creation, spread and \r\npreservation of culture and access to that creation \r\nthroughout the national territory, and to think about the \r\nissues that the society should consider in order to get to \r\nknow each other better.  \r\n This is how the manner of being, acting, speaking \r\nand thinking as Ivorians forms a whole, a relatively \r\nstable and open system that can preserve and impart \r\nitself from one generation to another, while improving \r\non contributions from outside.  \r\n This approach mainstreams the plurality and \r\nmobility that characterize the elements that make up \r\ncultures. In addition to the necessary diversity of \r\ntraditions and dialogue of cultures, the concept, the \r\nbasic element, of culture is inherent in humanity. \r\nLanguages differ, and with them the methods of \r\nsymbolizing, conceptualizing and theorizing. Forms of \r\nlabour and production also vary in time and space. \r\nLastly, judicial, moral and political institutions vary as \r\nwell.  \r\n That is why culture is not just an issue of \r\nethnicity. It is a fundamental human fact, the combined \r\nplay of symbolism and imagination. Culture is closely \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n17 07-52846 \r\n \r\nconnected with language and work, but it cannot really \r\nbe reduced to just that. Religious life and political life, \r\nand sometimes both, play a very important role in \r\nhuman societies, but they assume forms that do not \r\nlend themselves to a single definition.  \r\n Accordingly, the variety of cultures is enormous. \r\nHowever, this cultural diversity does not mean that \r\ncultures are heterogeneous and without any connecting \r\npoints or unifying factors. Unity may be the result of \r\nthe persistence of a common identity — that of a \r\nnature, a condition or a shared code of conduct. They \r\ncan also result from a history that is sometimes very \r\ncheckered, progressive and adaptive. Cultures start out \r\nby being alien to each other, sometimes hostile. Each \r\nconsiders itself exclusive and superior, but gradually \r\nthese cultures intermingle and start to question their \r\nown foundation.  \r\n The distribution on a scale of conflicts shows that \r\ntension is not merely between a common culture and \r\nfuture interpretations of it. The distribution of culture \r\nwithin a given society reflects a hierarchy of \r\ninstitutions and social status, and from that, wrenching \r\nsituations of inequality and privation result. Culture \r\ninvolves mechanisms of inclusion, but also of \r\nexclusion. These are not just the result of spontaneous, \r\nuncontrollable social tendencies, but are also acts that \r\nhave to do with conflict of ownership, both real and \r\nsymbolic, and sometimes they have to do with \r\nstrategies of controls.  \r\n Peace is inconceivable without the active \r\nparticipation of conscientious citizens. Peace is rooted \r\nin social justice, respect for human rights and the \r\nimplementation of international law. That is why the \r\nemergence of civil society as a new stakeholder for \r\npeace opens up important prospects for resolving and \r\neven preventing conflicts. \r\n As an example of the quest for hegemony, world \r\nmilitary expenditures increased by 34 per cent between \r\n1996 and 2005 and are now reckoned to be \r\n$1,118 trillion, at a time when a billion people are \r\nliving in extreme poverty. Surely something can be \r\ndone to develop, democratize and disarm.  \r\n Furthermore, the theme of the debate and the \r\nthinking at this meeting reflect existential problems. \r\nRelations between religions and cultures must help \r\nbuild peace between peoples; otherwise extremism and \r\nintolerance will impede sustainable development.  \r\n It is the mission of humankind to enshrine \r\nbrotherhood and build bridges between religions and \r\ncultures to bring about true peace. Tolerance, solidarity \r\nand brotherly love proceed from a culture that respects \r\nreligious and cultural foundations. Therefore, we could \r\nsay, paraphrasing one of the pioneers of negritude, that \r\nCôte d’Ivoire is a hand that is wounded but open to the \r\nworld and to people of goodwill, seeking fair trade and \r\nglobal solidarity. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nCheikh Tidiane Sy, Minister of Justice of Senegal. \r\n Mr. Sy (Senegal) (spoke in French): I should like \r\nat the outset to warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, \r\non the excellent initiative to hold the High-level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace, at a time \r\nwhen doubt seems to beset us and when conflict \r\nsituations — particularly those arising out of lack of \r\nunderstanding and religious intolerance — are \r\nmultiplying and becoming increasingly complex.  \r\n The holding of this debate is further proof of the \r\ninternational community’s resolute commitment to \r\nworking to strengthen dialogue among peoples, \r\ncultures and religions in order to frustrate the efforts of \r\nprophets of doom and deny the theories of those who \r\nbelieve in an inevitable clash of civilizations. In that \r\nregard, several national, regional and international \r\ninitiatives have already been taken to lay the \r\nfoundations for a fruitful dialogue among cultures and \r\nreligions. That is reflected in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/62/337), in which he reports on \r\nefforts being made by the principal institutions of the \r\nUnited Nations system working in this area. In that \r\nconnection, I should like to welcome the relevant \r\ninitiatives of UNESCO and the praiseworthy efforts of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations. I can assure the Assembly \r\nthat Senegal, as always, is engaged alongside all those \r\nwho are working to bring people together, to overcome \r\nobstacles born of a lack of understanding and to fight \r\nintolerance. \r\n Today more than ever before, the world is \r\nwracked by crises whose principal causes include, inter \r\nalia, religious differences, intolerance and the \r\nextremism of certain people having hidden agendas. In \r\nthe name of supposed religious or cultural convictions, \r\nthose people are committing terrible atrocities whose \r\nmain victims are often innocent women and children. \r\nSuch actions, fuelled and maintained by ignorance, run \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 18 \r\n \r\ncounter to the principles and precepts of every religion \r\nand reflect contempt for and violation of the sanctity of \r\nhuman life. We must eradicate forever this \r\nphenomenon, which has increased so much over the \r\npast few years. \r\n That is precisely why this encounter is so \r\nrelevant: it should enable us to embark on paths of \r\nreflection aimed at overcoming any attempt to \r\nmanipulate religious or cultural specificities for hidden \r\npurposes. I believe that the time has come to establish \r\nan open and unconditional dialogue that can enable us \r\nto remove obstacles, move beyond clichés and \r\nstereotypes and instil respect, acceptance and \r\nunderstanding among peoples.  \r\n The success of such a dialogue will depend \r\ngreatly on our commitment to demonstrating our \r\nattachment to certain common universal values, such as \r\njustice and equity, and our determination to eliminate \r\nantagonism and discord. It will also have to be \r\npredicated on mutual respect and acceptance of others’ \r\ndifferences, as an alternative to cultural contempt. \r\nMutual respect is a sine qua non for any dialogue and \r\nindeed for any joint human endeavour, for, as former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan declared, “We can love \r\nwhat we are, without hating what we are not” \r\n(A/56/PV.42, p. 3).  \r\n Those words of Kofi Annan are well understood \r\nin my country, Senegal, where the 95 per cent of the \r\npeople who are Muslim and the 5 per cent who are \r\nChristian live in peaceful coexistence on the basis of \r\nshared values of tolerance and respect for others. This \r\ninterfaith coexistence is so deeply rooted in Senegal \r\nthat it is not rare to find Christians and Muslims in the \r\nsame family as a result of mixed marriages, which have \r\nbecome a tangible sociological reality.  \r\n However, in order to consolidate and strengthen \r\nthat achievement, which is a result of the open spirit of \r\nthe Senegalese and their natural impulse to engage in \r\ndialogue, we constantly invite people to attend \r\ninterfaith meetings to overcome prejudice and lack of \r\nunderstanding. For it is true that, despite our physical \r\nproximity, intolerance and extremism can separate us \r\nfrom one another. It is precisely to invigorate and share \r\nthis valuable achievement that the President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal, Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, has called \r\nfor the holding of a summit on Islamic-Christian \r\ndialogue — an appeal that I should like to solemnly \r\nreiterate here.  \r\n However, President Wade, in the printed text of \r\nthe statement he made during last week’s general \r\ndebate at the present session of the General Assembly, \r\nrecalled: \r\n “It is unacceptable that the feelings of more than \r\na billion Muslims continue to be attacked by \r\nill-intentioned individuals in the name of a \r\nsupposedly limitless freedom of expression. All \r\nfreedoms are limited by responsibility.” \r\nFreedom of expression, respect for human rights and \r\ndemocracy all require moral authority so that they can \r\nbe not only consolidated and strengthened, but also, \r\nand above all, refined. Those principles remain fragile \r\nand require a framework to prevent both censorship \r\nand a drift away from them, which often has tragic \r\nconsequences for innocent people. That is why all \r\nsectors of society in all countries of the world must be \r\nfully involved in this endeavour of dialogue so as to \r\nbuild a reliable and viable consensus. \r\n As President Wade has said, the international \r\ncommunity must, without delay, cooperate to find \r\npaths of peaceful coexistence for current and future \r\ngenerations. How can we make the world’s political \r\nleaders, intellectuals and religious leaders shoulder \r\ntheir responsibility to put an end to extremists’ use of \r\nreligion? Indeed, it is important to say loudly and \r\nclearly that such extremism results from a \r\nmisunderstanding of holy writ. This quest for peace \r\nand harmony among people is everyone’s \r\nresponsibility, but the media have a primary role: to \r\nhelp us gain better understanding and avoid the pitfall \r\nof facile criticism and caricature. To banish the demon \r\nof intolerance is to eliminate the sources of \r\nmisunderstanding among peoples and to educate our \r\nyoung people to accept differences and respect others.  \r\n No culture is superior to another; no civilization \r\ncan presume to teach lessons to others. Everyone has \r\nthe right to dignity and respect for his or her religious \r\nconvictions. That is the golden rule that must be the \r\nbasis for dialogue among religions and cultures. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency The \r\nRev. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, Presidential Adviser \r\non Foreign Affairs and former Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Nicaragua. \r\n Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): May the all merciful God of love, peace, \r\nnon-violence, unity, reconciliation and solidarity \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n19 07-52846 \r\n \r\nenlighten our minds and open our hearts, so that all of \r\nus together as brothers and sisters, children of the same \r\nfather will be able to take strong steps towards creating \r\nthe culture of peace and non-violence that is so badly \r\nneeded in the world. \r\n Nicaragua celebrates the fact that the United \r\nNations is discussing dialogue, understanding and \r\ncooperation among religions and cultures for peace. We \r\nwould like to congratulate the Philippines and Pakistan \r\nfor that important initiative.  \r\n Nicaragua strongly believes that there is nothing \r\nmore urgent in the world than to set ourselves free \r\nfrom the terrible human addiction to violence, whether \r\nit is used to appropriate the belongings of others or in \r\nself-defence. It is absolutely clear that what is most \r\nneeded in the world is a culture of peace to counteract \r\nthe culture of war, death and destruction, or terrorism \r\ndisguised under the name of low-intensity warfare, \r\npreventive warfare or any other such camouflage. Our \r\nOrganization was created specifically to put an end to \r\nthe cycle of war which, by the middle of the last \r\ncentury, had resulted in two world wars. \r\n Respect for the principles of the Charter of our \r\nOrganization was supposed to put an end at least to \r\nmegawars. But if we look at the United Nations from \r\nthe perspective of its effectiveness in avoiding war, we \r\nwould have to conclude that it has not been effective at \r\nall. Among the mightiest of our own Members we find \r\nthose who are the most powerfully addicted to warfare \r\nas a tool to advance their own interests.  \r\n The international political dialogue has not \r\nmanaged to stop wars. They seem to be increasing in \r\nnumber day by day and threaten to continue to multiply \r\nwith the insane concept of preventive war whereby the \r\npotential aggressor resorts to his crystal ball to identify \r\nthe next target of his aggression and occupation. \r\nAmong the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil itself, you will find some who have tried to \r\nconvert the Council into a clearing house to approve or \r\nlicense their war plans.  \r\n In the meantime, the great majority of our \r\nMembers can only watch from the sidelines, because at \r\nthe level of political dialogue it is considered \r\npolitically incorrect to draw attention to or criticize the \r\npowerful even when the most egregious violations of \r\nthe Charter are being committed. \r\n We must therefore go beyond a purely political \r\ndialogue to meet each other at the deepest level of our \r\nshared humanity — in other words, on the terrain of \r\nour religions where we find the most deeply rooted \r\nbeliefs concerning the value and meaning of human \r\nlife. We are keenly aware that interfaith dialogue is not \r\nwithout arrogance and other flaws that often derail \r\npolitical dialogue. For that reason, Nicaragua would be \r\ninclined to promote cooperation among religions in the \r\ncontext of the creation of a culture of peace.  \r\n Ecumenical dialogue is very important, but we \r\nbelieve that through ecumenical cooperation we will be \r\nable to discover more rapidly that there are far more \r\nthings that unite human beings than things that \r\nsupposedly separate us. The supreme principle of \r\nunconditional love without exception or exclusion is \r\nundoubtedly the most important value that ties all \r\nreligions together. It will be through a mutual \r\ndiscovery of our values, concrete cooperation and \r\nthrough the creation of a culture of peace and \r\nnon-violence that we will be better able to advance \r\ntowards greater understanding between religions and \r\nthe cultures they influence.  \r\n It is through our religious faith and the teachings \r\nof our religions that most of us find universal \r\nfraternity. We are all brothers and sisters because we \r\nare all children of the same father. In other words, \r\nbecause God is everyone’s father, so we are all brothers \r\nand sisters created to live in peace and harmony as \r\nstewards of creation. But creation does not belong to \r\nus, for God is the only Lord and master of life and of \r\neverything that exists in creation.  \r\n Nothing could be more contrary to the will of our \r\ncommon father and creator than the reliance on warfare \r\nthat has become the greatest scourge in the world. All \r\nwho have reached that conclusion by the path of \r\nculture, religion or ethics have a duty to speak out in \r\nfavour of a culture of peace and non-violence. It is also \r\nincumbent upon us to rid ourselves once and for all of \r\nthe thought that denouncing the reliance on war \r\npractised by the powerful is politically incorrect. On \r\nthe contrary, not to denounce that concept as forcefully \r\nas it deserves to be denounced would be suicidal and \r\nunacceptable from an ethical and religious point of \r\nview.  \r\n It is through love of God and our neighbours that \r\nwe will find the strength to unfailingly struggle for a \r\nculture of peace and non-violence. Mahatma Gandhi is \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 20 \r\n \r\na prime example for us all. On one occasion, noting \r\nthat Gandhi had a picture of Jesus on his wall, Louis \r\nFischer, his famous biographer, asked him why he had \r\na picture of Jesus on his wall when he was not \r\nChristian. And Gandhi replied that he was, of course, \r\nChristian and Muslim and Hindu and Buddhist and \r\nJewish. God is the same god and, through our different \r\nreligions, teaches us that love and peace must be the \r\nessential qualities in the lives of the children of God — \r\nin other words, all the men and women on Earth. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nEminence Metropolitan Valentin of Orenburg, Leader \r\nof the Russian Orthodox Church of the Russian \r\nFederation. \r\n Metropolitan Valentin (Russian Federation) \r\n(spoke in Russian): Cooperation among religions and \r\ncultures is becoming tremendously important in today’s \r\nworld, which is confronting exacerbated inter-ethnic \r\npolitical and social contradictions, attempts to use \r\nreligion to justify terrorism and extremism, and the \r\nfailure of the secular system of social relations to \r\nproperly address certain challenges that relate to \r\nspiritual matters. \r\n More and more people today are concluding that \r\nattempts to deny religion the right to be heard in the \r\npublic forum — to make it the business of private life \r\nalone — that these attempts are futile and constitute \r\nencroachment on human freedom. The main problem of \r\nsocieties that are losing the concept of religion is that \r\nthey are too fragmented. Clearly, the cult of \r\nconsumerism and rampant egoism make them unstable \r\nand divided. Without the spiritual, vertical dimension \r\nof life, people’s lives will not be made happier by \r\nmoney, things, entertainment or technology. Without \r\nallegiance to the eternal moral principles, individuals \r\ncannot maintain or make an ideal either of the law or of \r\nfreedom. I am convinced that it is precisely traditional \r\nmorality that can be the solid foundation of the \r\npeaceful coexistence of peoples of various cultures and \r\nreligions. \r\n One of the factors leading to the growth of \r\nextremism is religious illiteracy among many of our \r\ncontemporaries. That is why it is so essential to \r\neducate young generations in the spirit of traditional \r\nreligions. Recently, this idea was supported by the \r\nPresident of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir \r\nPutin. I believe that everywhere where people so desire \r\nthey must have the right to receive in-depth knowledge \r\nin a regular public school about their religious \r\ntradition, and also basic knowledge about the views \r\nand convictions of those living side by side with them. \r\n The Russian model of interreligious relations has \r\nlong been built on respect for the faith and the way of \r\nlife and customs of traditional communities, and for the \r\nprinciples of establishing a family and a social entity \r\namong them. The inhabitants of our country have \r\ndifferent faiths; but we have always recognized the \r\nright of us all to live and act according to our \r\nprinciples, both in private life and in public life. It is \r\nprecisely that which has created the conditions for civil \r\npeace and strengthened stability. As a result, Russia has \r\nnever had religious wars. Today, communities of the \r\ntraditional religions of Russia, namely Orthodoxy, \r\nIslam, Judaism and Buddhism, continue their centuries-\r\nold interreligious dialogue. \r\n The Interreligious Council of Russia, which was \r\nestablished in 1998, acts on the basis of the \r\ninviolability of religious teachings and of moral rules, \r\nwhich, to a large extent, are the same across religions. \r\nWe were convinced that our model of dialogue was the \r\nright one at the World Summit of Religious Leaders \r\nheld in Moscow in July 2006. Authoritative religious \r\nleaders from 49 countries supported our concept \r\nregarding the link between human freedom and moral \r\nresponsibility. \r\n The universal nature of the United Nations makes \r\nit crucial to take into account the spiritual traditions \r\nand diversity of world cultures and religions. In recent \r\nyears, attention to this factor has been reflected in \r\nvarious initiatives within the context of this world \r\nOrganization. These include the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith \r\nCooperation for Peace, the Ministerial Meeting on \r\nInterfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace, as well \r\nas other initiatives. Each of these initiatives is \r\nimportant and valuable. The World Summit of \r\nReligious Leaders unanimously supported a more \r\nsystematic dialogue between the religious community \r\nand the United Nations. \r\n Accordingly, I would imagine that it would make \r\nsense now to develop the outcomes of the Summit \r\ndiscussions and think about creating, under United \r\nNations aegis, a special forum, a kind of consultative \r\ncouncil of religions, for the exchange of views among \r\nrepresentatives of the main world faiths. We hope that \r\nthe activities of this council could help not just to \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n21 07-52846 \r\n \r\nstrengthen the foundations of interreligious peace, but \r\nalso to enrich the process of the elaboration and \r\nadoption of decisions by the world community. This \r\nidea could become the subject of a thorough discussion \r\nat this and at future sessions of the General Assembly. \r\nAnd I am pleased that the High-level Dialogue \r\nprovides a good opportunity to discuss such an \r\nimportant question. \r\n I am grateful to the President of the General \r\nAssembly and to the countries that sponsored \r\nresolution A/61/269 and to the organizers of today’s \r\nforum for implementing the initiative of the Dialogue \r\nthat, for the first time, is taking place within the walls \r\nof this world Organization. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hidayat Orujov, Head of the State \r\nCommittee on Relations with Religious Organizations \r\nof Azerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Orujov (Azerbaijan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nFirst of all, I should like to discharge the honourable \r\nduty entrusted to me by transmitting to this General \r\nAssembly the sincere greetings, as well as good \r\nwishes, of the people of Azerbaijan and the personal \r\nwishes of our head of State, President Ilham Aliyev. I \r\nexpress the hope that this meeting will be an important \r\ncontribution in expanding cooperation among religious \r\ncommunities and cultures, conducive to global peace \r\nand security. \r\n This stage of globalization brings peoples and \r\npopulations closer together but exposes even more the \r\ncharacteristics that draw sustenance from a unique kind \r\nof mentality and expression of faith. Today, we are \r\nliving at a time of heightened religious awareness, \r\nwhich sometimes takes on exaggerated forms. And \r\nsometimes it is maliciously exploited to fuel conflicts \r\non religious grounds. For that reason, it is so crucial \r\nfor tolerance to be established and to prevail. \r\n I must say with a feeling of pride that tolerance, \r\nestablished by the civilized world as one of the main \r\ndemocratic values, is a characteristic of our people that \r\nhas evolved over centuries and could serve as an \r\nexample for others. \r\n Historically speaking, Azerbaijan was a meeting \r\nplace for various faiths and civilizations. Today, it is \r\nsuccessfully carrying out that function. Together with \r\nIslam, other faiths have historically existed in \r\nAzerbaijan — Christianity and Judaism, among others. \r\nBasically, since time immemorial, Azerbaijan became a \r\nsecond homeland for people suffering from religious \r\ndiscrimination. People congregated in Azerbaijan with \r\nhope, not only the persecuted adherents of various \r\nreligions, but adherents of various interpretations of \r\nIslam, too. Perhaps that is precisely why the population \r\nof Azerbaijan is so varied in ethnic and religious terms. \r\n Fortunately, in Azerbaijan, where various faiths \r\nand religious trends were propagated throughout our \r\nhistory, relations of tolerance were established and \r\nprevailed between various communities. And we had \r\nno noted instances of xenophobia on ethnic, racial or \r\nreligious grounds. Various groups that put down roots \r\nin the territory of Azerbaijan did not feel that they were \r\noutsiders and made themselves at home. \r\n For example, the history of the emergence of \r\nJews in Azerbaijan goes back a long, long way — \r\n2,500 years — and during this enormous period of \r\nhistory, there is no evidence of any discrimination \r\nagainst them by the Azerbaijan people. \r\n Christianity in Azerbaijan historically was one of \r\nthe leading religions, and today our people views its \r\npast as being connected with that faith, as being a \r\ncomponent of its glorious history. I am pleased that \r\nAzerbaijan is one of the few countries where mosque, \r\nchurch and synagogue coexist side by side, in peace, \r\nand where there are no instances of any discord \r\nbetween people of different religious faiths. \r\n We note, however, with some bitterness the fact \r\nthat Azerbaijani territory is still being occupied by \r\nArmenia, which is abusing the traditional tolerance of \r\nour people in carrying out at the State level a policy of \r\nethnic cleansing and genocide. During the last century, \r\nmore than one million Azerbaijanis lived in Armenia; \r\ntoday, not a single representative of our people remains \r\nthere. The same fate hit Azerbaijanis living in the \r\nNagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, too. And \r\nregions contiguous with it are now occupied by the \r\narmed forces of the Republic of Armenia. \r\n The General Assembly must agree that it is \r\ntherefore hard to believe the statement about tolerance \r\nthat we heard coming from the mouth of the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Armenia today in this very Hall. \r\nAmong the casualties of this aggression are our \r\nhistorical and religious monuments; the shrines of \r\nother faiths have also fallen victim. And this is before \r\nthe eyes of the entire world. In our lands that have been \r\noccupied, they have razed our religious monuments to \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 22 \r\n \r\nthe ground. Many times we have turned to this \r\nOrganization and to the world community demanding \r\nthat the four Security Council resolutions on the \r\nproblem be implemented calling for the unconditional \r\nliberation of the lands occupied by Armenia. \r\n More than a million citizens of Azerbaijan have \r\nbeen condemned to be refugees and have been forcibly \r\ndisplaced; and they must be returned to their ancestral \r\nhomes. Yet, the occupier, Armenia, still does not want \r\nto give up its territorial appetites. \r\n I appeal to you and through you, participants in \r\nthis forum, to all countries and international \r\norganizations, and I call for your cooperation, in the \r\nname of restoring the trampled rights of a million of \r\nmy compatriots rendered hapless by the occupiers. I \r\ncall upon you to heed the voice of Azerbaijan, which \r\nfor centuries has revered the lofty tenets of good-\r\nneighbourliness, love of humankind and tolerance \r\ninherent in all of the great religions. \r\n I hope that the Azerbaijan people and my country \r\nwill receive due, well-deserved consideration in this \r\nrespect and that our experience will help and benefit \r\nother peoples and States. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Senator Rod \r\nKemp of Australia. \r\n Mr. Kemp (Australia): The right to freedom of \r\nreligion or belief is a basic right and an essential \r\nelement of any harmonious society. It is embodied in \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which \r\nstates that everyone has the right to freedom of \r\nthought, conscience and religion. \r\n Unfortunately, in many areas of the world, many \r\npeople do not enjoy these freedoms: they cannot \r\nworship freely; they suffer from discrimination. \r\nReligious intolerance and extremism continue to \r\nthreaten global security, peace and stability. The \r\nimportance of defending religious freedom, cannot, \r\ntherefore be overstated. \r\n To build and maintain free societies, we have to \r\nrecognize that different ideas and beliefs can and \r\nshould be allowed to coexist and flourish, because \r\ntolerance and respect for pluralism are essential values \r\nfor an open society. \r\n Australia is a culturally and linguistically diverse \r\nsociety, with about 300 languages spoken and a wide \r\nvariety of religions practised. The Australian \r\nGovernment promotes acceptance and respect among \r\nAustralians of all cultural and religious backgrounds. \r\n In this context, Australia has implemented the \r\n“Living in Harmony” programme for several years, \r\nbringing Australians from different backgrounds \r\ntogether to forge a sense of belonging, mutual respect \r\nand understanding. More than 50 projects to promote \r\ninterfaith dialogue have been funded under this \r\nprogramme. \r\n In 2006, Australia embarked on a national action \r\nplan to build on social cohesion, harmony and security, \r\nto which the Australian Government has committed \r\nA$ 35 million over four years. Measures under the plan \r\ninclude the creation of a centre of research in Islamic \r\nstudies, the promotion of interfaith understanding \r\nthrough interschool cooperation, employment and \r\ninter-community engagement projects, crisis \r\nmanagement training and specialist education \r\nmaterials. \r\n Australia strongly supports freedom of religion \r\nand belief and is determined to promote understanding \r\nand foster harmony between faith communities across \r\nour region. Our regional efforts aim to bridge cultural \r\nand religious differences and counter the spread of \r\nextremism. \r\n Australia has fostered interfaith cooperation \r\nthrough our involvement in the Regional Interfaith \r\nDialogue, a process which we co-sponsor with \r\nIndonesia, New Zealand and the Philippines. The \r\ninaugural Regional Interfaith Dialogue took place in \r\nYogyakarta in 2004 and was co-chaired by Indonesia \r\nand Australia. New Zealand hosted the third Regional \r\nInterfaith Dialogue in Waitangi in May 2007. \r\nParticipants in those dialogues are drawn from the \r\nmajor faith groups of the region, the 10 nations of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, East Timor, \r\nFiji, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. The 2007 \r\nDialogue resulted in agreement on the Waitangi \r\nDeclaration and Plan of Action. The Plan of Action \r\noutlined recommendations by representatives for future \r\nregional engagement on interfaith issues, particularly \r\nin the areas of partnership-building, education and \r\nmedia. \r\n Interfaith dialogues are an important forum \r\nwithin which to promote peace, tolerance and \r\nunderstanding by working with faith and civil society \r\ngroups in our region and beyond. Although \r\nGovernments can play an important role in facilitating \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n23 07-52846 \r\n \r\ndialogue, the responsibility for promoting tolerance \r\nand understanding between and within communities \r\nmust rest with the communities themselves, \r\nparticularly their leaders. Faith and community leaders \r\nhave a critical role to play in denying extremists any \r\nreligious or moral legitimacy and in building trust \r\nbetween communities. \r\n Separately, Australia and the European Union \r\nwill co-host a youth interfaith forum in Australia in \r\nDecember 2007. The event will focus on promoting \r\nunderstanding and encouraging personal links between \r\nyoung leaders of religious communities in South-East \r\nAsia, Australia and Europe. In support of interfaith \r\ndialogue processes, Australia is also hosting the \r\nParliament of the World’s Religions in 2009 — the \r\nworld’s largest multi-faith event, which is usually held \r\nevery five years in different cities around the world. \r\n Australia will continue to engage constructively \r\non this issue with the Human Rights Council by \r\nencouraging the global promotion of religious \r\ntolerance in that important forum. The Council needs \r\nto play an active role in ensuring the promotion and \r\nprotection of the right to freedom of religion or belief, \r\nincluding by monitoring international adherence to the \r\nprovisions of the Declaration on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on \r\nReligion or Belief. \r\n Australia welcomes the United Nations Alliance \r\nof Civilizations initiative to support projects that \r\npromote cross-cultural and religious understanding. \r\nAustralia believes that its practical initiatives \r\ncomplement the interfaith activities taking place in our \r\nregion. \r\n We, the international community, should continue \r\nto forge interfaith and international partnerships that \r\naim to ensure that the right to freedom of religion is \r\nrespected in all countries.  \r\n The President: I call on His Excellency Mr. João \r\nGomes Cravinho, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Cooperation of Portugal, who will speak on behalf \r\nof the European Union. \r\n Mr. Gomes Cravinho (Portugal): In Portugal’s \r\nrole as European Union (EU) presidency, I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. We \r\nwelcome this High-level Dialogue on Interreligious \r\nand Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for \r\nPeace, including the interactive hearing with \r\nrepresentatives of civil society to take place this \r\nafternoon. We believe that Europe has a key role to \r\nplay in the promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding, along with other regions of the world. \r\n In the history of international relations, the \r\nchallenge for so long has been the peaceful coexistence \r\nof different value systems. Over the centuries, many \r\ndifferent ways to avoid conflict have been sought.  \r\nOne solution is for nations to share peace and \r\nprosperity through dialogue, understanding and \r\ntolerance. \r\n Mutual understanding does not entail imposing \r\none’s values, culture or faith on others. It involves \r\nrespecting different values and beliefs based on an \r\nawareness of the common political, economic, social, \r\necological and cultural challenges that we face in an \r\nincreasingly global and vulnerable world. It means \r\nprotecting and promoting all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms that have been repeatedly \r\nreaffirmed as universal; it entails freedom of \r\nexpression and freedom of religion or belief; and it \r\nrequires an open mind and the willingness to \r\nunderstand the pluralism of cultures, religions and \r\nbeliefs. \r\n Beyond those attitudes and intercultural \r\ncompetences, we must focus on concrete cooperation \r\nand common actions. Pluralism in European society \r\nand the legal, political and social conditions for coping \r\nwith it have been major factors for prosperity and \r\ndevelopment. We must enhance mutual understanding \r\non the basis of our firm conviction that human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of \r\nexpression, are the common ground on which we stand. \r\n Dialogue will succeed only if we make sure that \r\nboth men and women’s experiences and expertise are \r\nintegrated effectively into our intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogue and into social and political \r\ninitiatives of conflict prevention at all levels. Dialogue \r\nwill bear fruit only if we enable our youth to respond \r\nactively and positively to the challenges of our \r\npluralistic and vulnerable world. \r\n The European Union is founded on the principles \r\nof liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. Those \r\nprinciples are common to all member States and the \r\nEU is ready to play its part in the process. A common \r\nunderstanding and acceptance of core values among \r\nEuropeans of all social, cultural and religious \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 24 \r\n \r\nbackgrounds is crucial for peaceful cohabitation and \r\nsocial cohesion. In consequence, the EU applies its \r\ncore values and principles in all of its policies and \r\npromotes them within Europe and beyond. \r\n The European Union’s integration and \r\nnon-discrimination policies are guided by the \r\nfollowing principles: the principle of equality before \r\nthe law; the prohibition of discrimination on the basis \r\nof any ground and the fight against racism; respect for \r\ncultural, linguistic and religious diversity; and equality \r\nbetween men and women. \r\n The EU promotes freedom of religion and belief \r\nthroughout European societies and beyond, including \r\nthrough the media. The resolution introduced to the \r\nAssembly by the EU on the elimination of all forms of \r\nintolerance and of discrimination based on religion or \r\nbelief, which was adopted last year by consensus, is \r\nbut one example of our commitment to guarantee that \r\nfundamental freedom. \r\n European culture has been enriched by outside \r\ninfluences throughout its history, and European culture \r\nand ideas have had a profound influence on many \r\ncultures throughout the world. Europeans of various \r\nsocial, cultural and religious backgrounds contribute to \r\nthe diversity and prosperity of Europe today. Today’s \r\nEuropean identity is a multiple one; it reflects manifold \r\nand pluralist influences, including those of migration \r\nand globalization. Europe faces the challenges of \r\ncontinuously developing and strengthening the \r\ndialogue with its various communities, ethnic \r\nminorities and numerous religious communities, \r\nincluding the very positive engagement with Muslims \r\nof and in Europe. The European Union views its \r\npolitical and legal framework as essential to ensuring \r\nsocial peace and cohesion and to marginalizing \r\nradicalism and extremism on all sides. Freedom of \r\nreligion, non-discrimination and recognition of \r\nreligious communities in particular are crucial \r\npreconditions for any successful dialogue.  \r\n The importance of intercivilizational \r\nunderstanding is strongly reflected in European Union \r\npolicy and action. The EU is active in promoting \r\nintercultural and interreligious understanding, both \r\nwithin Europe and with international partners. I would \r\nlike to give some examples of initiatives strongly \r\nsupported by the European Union that aim at \r\npromoting a more peaceful and cohesive society.  \r\n The Euromed Barcelona process provides a \r\nframework for dialogue between the European Union \r\nand its Mediterranean partners. It established the Anna \r\nLindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue \r\nbetween Cultures. The Foundation’s main objective is \r\nto bring people and organizations from both shores of \r\nthe Mediterranean closer to each other and to help \r\nbridge the gap between them. Particular importance is \r\ngiven to the development of human resources, while \r\nyouth is the main target group. Another priority is the \r\npromotion of tolerance among people by furthering \r\nexchanges between members of diverse civil societies. \r\nThe Foundation, which facilitates the coordination of \r\n35 national networks, has programmes in the fields of \r\nmedia, education, women and youth. \r\n With a membership of 43 Asian and European \r\nStates, the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is uniquely \r\nplaced to foster links between Asia and Europe through \r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue. ASEM Interfaith \r\nDialogues have helped to build mutual understanding \r\nbetween Asians and Europeans in the fields of \r\ninterfaith and interreligious relations. The third ASEM \r\nInterfaith Dialogue was held in Nanjing, China, in June \r\nthis year. Together with the two previous meetings — \r\nin Bali, Indonesia in 2005, and in Larnaca, Cyprus, in \r\n2006 — they addressed the relations of interfaith \r\ndialogue to peace, justice, compassion and tolerance. \r\nThe Nanjing Statement issued at the end of the \r\nDialogue reflected the role of interfaith dialogue in \r\nglobalization, peace, social cohesion and development, \r\nand cultural and educational cooperation. A fourth \r\nDialogue is scheduled for 2008 in Amsterdam. \r\n Additionally, the ASEM partnership has achieved \r\nsubstantial results in boosting cultural, educational, \r\nintellectual and people-to-people exchanges, expanding \r\nand facilitating research, networking and promoting \r\ncultural diversity.  \r\n Europe is a strong supporter of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations initiative. It was proposed by the \r\nPresident of the Spanish Government in 2005 and \r\nco-sponsored by the Turkish Prime Minister. In April \r\n2007, the Secretary-General appointed Jorge Sampaio, \r\nformer President of Portugal, as his High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance of Civilizations. The \r\nAlliance, with the endorsement of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, intends to galvanize collective action across \r\ndiverse societies in order to combat extremism, \r\novercome cultural and social barriers between mainly \r\nthe Western and predominantly Muslim worlds, and \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n25 07-52846 \r\n \r\nreduce tensions and polarization between societies that \r\ndiffer in religious and cultural values.  \r\n It is our understanding that, in order to most \r\neffectively move forward the agenda of dialogue and \r\ntolerance, the Alliance of Civilizations and other \r\nUnited Nations initiatives for enhancing dialogue and \r\nmutual understanding should be carried out in a \r\ncoordinated, coherent, and complementary manner \r\nwithin the existing institutional framework. The EU \r\nsees the Alliance of Civilizations as a flagship \r\ninitiative in that area, and we would see it as a \r\npotential focal point for the increasing number of \r\ninitiatives. Through a better coordination of initiatives, \r\nrather than their proliferation, we improve our chances \r\nof making a difference. \r\n Turning again to Europe, the Council of Europe \r\nwhite paper on intercultural dialogue is expected to be \r\nadopted in November 2007. On its website devoted \r\nentirely to the role of intercultural dialogue, the \r\nCouncil states its firm belief that  \r\n“[d]ialogue between cultures, the oldest and most \r\nfundamental mode of democratic conversation, is \r\nan antidote to rejection and violence. Its objective \r\nis to enable us to live together peacefully and \r\nconstructively in a multicultural world and to \r\ndevelop a sense of community and belonging”. \r\n Finally, in October 2005, the European \r\nCommission proposed that 2008 be declared the \r\nEuropean Year of Intercultural Dialogue. With a budget \r\nof €10 million, the European Year of Intercultural \r\nDialogue will present a wide variety of enriching \r\nconcrete projects that will be implemented in the \r\nframework of EU programmes and other Community \r\nactions. The Year of Intercultural Dialogue will \r\nencourage the mobilization of civil society and actors \r\nat the European, national and local levels. Culture, \r\neducation, youth, sport and citizenship will be the \r\nfocus of activities. \r\n To conclude, it is possible that the term \r\n“intercivilizational or intercultural dialogue” might be \r\nconstrued as an endorsement of the idea that humanity \r\nis divided by monolithic and entirely distinguishable \r\ncivilizations, but that is far from accurate. In reality, \r\nthe boundary lines between cultures are mostly unclear. \r\nOver time and space, different cultures influence each \r\nother profoundly. Most civilizations harbour people of \r\ndifferent cultures who coexist peacefully. The \r\nEuropean Union is committed to promoting dialogue \r\nand understanding, and to striving for universal \r\nappreciation of different religions, cultures and beliefs. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Her Excellency \r\nMs. Karen Hughes, Under-Secretary for Public \r\nDiplomacy and Public Affairs of the Department of \r\nState of the United States of America. \r\n Ms. Hughes (United States of America): I am \r\nhonoured to be here. I thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for convening \r\nthis dialogue on religious and cultural understanding, \r\nand the Foreign Ministers of Pakistan and the \r\nPhilippines for proposing it.  \r\n A noble framework — the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, which President Bush cited here last \r\nweek — guides our work. It recognizes that \r\n“[e]veryone has the right to freedom of thought, \r\nconscience and religion” and the right to manifest \r\nthose beliefs in “teaching, practice, worship and \r\nobservance” (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \r\nart. 18). This historic Declaration states that the right \r\nof religious freedom is both universal and human, \r\napplying to all people in all places. \r\n Unfortunately, in too many places today, people \r\nare still persecuted for their beliefs or denied the right \r\nto worship. Yet our Universal Declaration and my own \r\ncountry’s guarantee of freedom of religion challenge \r\nall of us to live up to our own high principles — to \r\nallow people to practice faith freely, to respect \r\ndifferent beliefs, to seek to understand even when we \r\ndo not agree, and to speak out against those who, \r\nthrough words or actions, trample religious tolerance.  \r\n My job of public diplomacy is to reach out to the \r\nrest of the world and other peoples in a spirit of \r\nfriendship and to respect and listen to the concerns and \r\ninterests of others, and President Bush asked me to \r\nmake encouraging interfaith dialogue part of my work. \r\nFaith is foundational in many people’s lives, and world \r\nleaders would not be wise to ignore its power or to \r\ncede its discussion to extremists.  \r\n As I travel the world, it is often my privilege to \r\nmeet people whose faith has called them to do great \r\ngood. I have met Muslim American doctors who \r\ntravelled to Pakistan to help care for victims of the \r\nearthquake there; Catholic nuns who helped families \r\nleft homeless by mudslides in Central America; and \r\nvolunteers from many nations whose good hearts led \r\nthem to help fight AIDS and malaria in Africa and \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 26 \r\n \r\nbuild schools in Afghanistan. I know first-hand that \r\nthere are people of good will in all faiths and cultures. \r\n My country is known for the separation of church \r\nand State, meaning that the United States Government \r\ncan neither impose religion nor restrict its practice. Yet \r\nI worry that people in other parts of the world \r\nsometimes mistake freedom of religion to mean \r\nfreedom from religion. Nothing could be further from \r\nthe truth. In America, people of many different faiths \r\nand those of no faith live side by side and try to respect \r\neach other’s views. We are not perfect, and religion is \r\nsometimes a source of division, as is race, but respect \r\nfor each other’s diversity is our goal, and in the \r\naftermath of 11 September, many Christian, Jewish and \r\nMuslim Americans reached out to try to better \r\nunderstand each other.  \r\n I have found that people of all faiths have much \r\nin common. As a Christian, my highest commandments \r\nare to love God and love my neighbour. My Muslim \r\nand Jewish friends tell me the same is true for them. \r\nWhile there are theological differences, ultimately I \r\nbelieve that the vast majority of people of every faith \r\nand culture want similar things for themselves and \r\ntheir families — education and health care, a safe \r\nneighbourhood, a good job — and most people want \r\nour lives to make a difference and to leave our world a \r\nlittle better. These are not dreams owned by any one \r\nnation or people, but shared human dreams. Despite \r\ndifferences of language or culture or skin colour, so \r\nmuch more unites us as human beings than divides us.  \r\n Yet, we live in a world where misunderstanding \r\nand mistrust are being inflamed by rhetoric of hate and \r\nacts of terror. And, as leaders from Malaysia and the \r\nPalestinian territories said in their addresses before the \r\nGeneral Assembly this year, we must not leave the \r\ndebate only to those who seek to pervert religion by \r\nusing violence to pursue political agendas.  \r\n As I travel the world representing my country and \r\nlistening to people of other countries, I find two major \r\nmisperceptions. First, in many Muslim-majority \r\nnations, people worry that the war against terror is \r\ndirected at them. I want to assure our friends across the \r\nworld that this is not the case. Most Americans \r\nrecognize that terrorists do not represent mainstream \r\nthinking and do not represent, but, instead, pervert all \r\nfaiths with their barbaric acts. Many of America’s own \r\ncitizens have roots in the Arab world. Others come \r\nfrom virtually every culture and faith tradition. Islam is \r\npart of the West and part of America, and several \r\nmillion American Muslims live, work and worship \r\nfreely in our country. \r\n The second major misperception comes from my \r\nfellow Americans. I hear the complaint that Muslims \r\ndo not speak out against terrorist violence. Yet that is \r\nnot the case either. Many constructive voices speak out \r\nstrongly. Afghanistan’s President Karzai has \r\ncondemned suicide bombing as contrary to Islam and \r\nsays that terrorists cheat children by recruiting them. \r\nThe Secretary-General of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference speaks out strongly against \r\nterrorist acts. Iraqi and Algerian citizens have \r\ndenounced terrorists as murderers. Sheikh Salman  \r\nal-Awdah, a leader of the Sahwa reform movement, \r\nsent an open letter condemning Osama bin Laden for \r\nmurdering innocents, saying, “This religion that \r\nprotects the sanctity of blood, even that of the birds \r\nand animals, can never approve the killing of innocents \r\nwhatever the reasons or motives might be”. As the \r\nSheikh’s letter suggests, the time has come when good \r\npeople of all faiths must join together to state clearly \r\nthat killing oneself in order to kill others is wrong and \r\na matter of shame, never honour. \r\n There are many legitimate grievances in our \r\nworld, but none can ever justify the targeting and \r\nmurder of innocents. This has no place in a civilized \r\nworld. We all have a role, and America wants to be a \r\npartner in encouraging dialogue. Through websites and \r\ncommunications alerts, we are working to highlight the \r\nmany voices speaking out against terrorist violence and \r\nfor greater interfaith understanding. We are \r\nencouraging interfaith dialogue and conversations \r\nbetween cultures.  \r\n Through a new programme called Citizen \r\nDialogue, we have sent Muslim-American citizens \r\nacross the world to engage with grass-roots citizens in \r\nMuslim communities. We brought international \r\nreligious clerics here and sent American clerics abroad. \r\nWe have sponsored summer programmes for young \r\npeople, teaching respect for diversity. We have sent out \r\nmusicians to promote tolerance and to show that \r\ndifferences can enrich rather than divide us. \r\n We are dramatically expanding our two-way \r\neducation and exchange programmes, bringing \r\ninternational visitors here and sending Americans \r\nabroad. I believe that there is no better way to build \r\nrespect and understanding than to visit, study and work \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n27 07-52846 \r\n \r\nin each other’s countries. We have increased \r\nparticipation in these vital programmes from 27,000 \r\npeople just a few years ago to more than 40,000 today, \r\nand we are hoping to increase it further, to more than \r\n50,000. \r\n We are also encouraging more Americans to \r\ntravel and study overseas to experience the world’s rich \r\ncultural and religious contributions, to learn more \r\nabout other nations of the world. We have started a new \r\nlanguage initiative, encouraging America’s young \r\npeople to study Arabic, Chinese, Hindi and other \r\nimportant world languages.  \r\n Today’s gathering is a reminder that we are all \r\npart of an increasingly interconnected world that calls \r\non each of us — no matter what our culture or faith \r\ncommunity — to work for peace, life and hope. Each \r\nfaith and culture has the responsibility of confirming to \r\nall that it respects other faiths and cultures. As we \r\nlisten to and learn from one another, we are building a \r\nsafer and more respectful world for the next \r\ngeneration.  \r\n This year, the world is celebrating the \r\n800th anniversary of the birth of Rumi, the great Sufi \r\npoet, who wrote, “When someone asks what there is to \r\ndo, light the candle in their hand”. Through dialogue, \r\nwe are lighting candles, and I hope this light will shine \r\nacross the world. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Viktar Gaisenak, Deputy Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Belarus. \r\n Mr. Gaisenak (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nReligious intolerance, xenophobia and opposition of \r\none culture to another today pose a real threat to peace \r\nand stability in our world. Accordingly, engaging in a \r\ndialogue among cultures and religions, based on \r\nmutual understanding, equality, mutual respect and \r\ntolerance, is a major challenge of our day. \r\n The Republic of Belarus has repeatedly \r\nproclaimed its commitment to intensifying this kind of \r\ndialogue for peace. Proof of this is the initiative put \r\nforward by President Lukashenka at the 2005 World \r\nSummit (see A/60/PV.5) to recognize diversity of ways \r\nto progress in the development of States as a value of \r\nhuman civilization.  \r\n Respect for the sui generis nature of States and \r\nthe right of peoples to follow their own path based on \r\ninternational dialogue is an essential condition for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\nDialogue among cultures and religions has to take \r\nplace at all levels — national, regional and global. The \r\nRepublic of Belarus and its Government are making \r\nthe necessary effort to support this kind of dialogue at \r\nthe national level. Our country is a multi-ethnic and \r\nmultireligious State. Belarus has more than 140 ethnic \r\ngroups, and more than 3,000 organizations reflecting \r\n25 faiths and religious beliefs operate in Belarus.  \r\n The concern of the State to ensure the right of our \r\ncitizens to enjoy the freedom of conscience and \r\nreligion, as enshrined in the legislation of our \r\nRepublic, is implemented in everyday life. The \r\nGovernment’s programme for the development of \r\ncooperation with religions has been adopted and is \r\nbeing successfully carried out, as is cooperation with \r\nethnic groups and our compatriots living abroad.  \r\n Belarus is taking concrete steps at the \r\ninternational level as well, including within the United \r\nNations in order to support religious and cultural \r\nunderstanding. Our country was one of the first to \r\naccede to the UNESCO Convention on the Protection \r\nand Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural \r\nExpressions. The Republic of Belarus has traditionally \r\nbeen a sponsor of all draft resolutions adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly that seek to encourage dialogue \r\namong civilizations and cultures. \r\n In June 2007, our country participated in the \r\nConference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace and the \r\nMinisterial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and \r\nCooperation for Peace. The purpose of our \r\nparticipation in these initiatives is to support real steps \r\nto expanding interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding and dialogue for peace.  \r\n Accordingly, we welcome the establishment in \r\nthe Secretariat of a focal point for questions of \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue and \r\ncooperation. In addition, we believe it would be \r\ndesirable to make better use of the information and \r\ncommunication technology mechanisms within the \r\nSecretariat, including United Nations Radio, as well as \r\nthe resources of the specialized agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system, to promote \r\nthe development of interfaith understanding and \r\ncooperation. We also welcome the productive steps \r\ntaken towards the implementation of international \r\ninitiatives within the United Nations to mutually enrich \r\ncultures and to make progress towards implementing \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 28 \r\n \r\nthe Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, \r\nin particular the appointment of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance of Civilizations. \r\n In the context of the item that we are now \r\ndiscussing, a truly remarkable international event took \r\nplace in September this year: the Ministerial Meeting \r\nof the Non-Aligned Countries held in Tehran. For the \r\nfirst time ever, the topic of cultural diversity and \r\nhuman rights was discussed within the context of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. That is a natural outcome of \r\nthe development of the Movement, which does not \r\nendorse confrontation and defends every country’s \r\nright to choose its own path of progressive \r\ndevelopment for the benefit of its population, without \r\nfear of the powerful of this world. The Movement is \r\nfocusing on intercultural dialogue and cooperation \r\nbecause it is a key to achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment and mutual understanding at all levels.  \r\n We believe that the Tehran Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action on Human Rights and Cultural \r\nDiversity, which was adopted as the outcome of that \r\nmeeting, and the decision to establish a Non-Aligned \r\nMovement Centre for Human Rights and Cultural \r\nDiversity are of great importance not only for the \r\nMovement but also for the international community as \r\na whole. The Declaration, inter alia, calls upon the \r\ninternational community to maximize the benefits of \r\nglobalization and cooperation to promote \r\nunderstanding and respect for cultural diversity. It \r\nemphasizes that it is only through broad and sustained \r\nefforts that we can create a shared future based on our \r\ncommon humanity and all its diversity. It indicates \r\npriority areas for such efforts, in particular education, \r\nthe mass media, cultural and academic activities and \r\ncooperation within the United Nations and other \r\ninternational organizations, as well as activities by \r\nnon-governmental organizations. The Movement’s \r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs also agreed that issues \r\nrelated to respect for human rights and cultural \r\ndiversity must be taken into account in programmes in \r\nthe main areas of the Movement’s activities.  \r\n I assure the General Assembly that the Republic \r\nof Belarus will continue to participate actively in \r\ncoordinated international efforts to achieve full mutual \r\nunderstanding among cultures and religions, in the \r\nservice of peace and progress in our world. \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Helena Bambasova, Deputy Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Czech Republic. \r\n Ms. Bambasova (Czech Republic): The Czech \r\nRepublic aligns itself with the statement made earlier \r\nby the representative of Portugal on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. \r\n Over the centuries, the inhabitants of the territory \r\nof the Czech Republic, a country at the very centre of \r\nEurope, have witnessed the disastrous consequences of \r\nmany periods of religious intolerance and of the failure \r\nto respect cultural diversity and diversity of opinion. \r\nMany people had to go into exile to preserve their \r\nbeliefs and ideas, and we take pride in the fact that \r\nmany of them took their ideals of peaceful cooperation \r\nand cultural tolerance along with them. Among others, \r\nJan Amos Comenius and many of his Moravian \r\nbrothers had to leave their country in search of more \r\ntolerant places. \r\n When the Czechoslovak State first saw the light \r\nof day, in 1918, wide-reaching religious freedom, and \r\nfreedom of faith and conscience were constitutionally \r\nguaranteed. That paved the way for interreligious \r\ndialogue and for an equal partnership between religion \r\nand a democratic State based on civil society. After the \r\nfall of communism, our society once again opened up \r\nto the outside world, and we began to learn new \r\nlessons about accepting cultural and religious \r\ndifferences as a value rather than a threat. \r\n Nearly 60 years ago, the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights became an inspiration for all societies. \r\nFollowing the tragic events of the Second World War, \r\nand with the painful memory of suffering still vivid, \r\nnations demonstrated a strong commitment not to allow \r\na repetition of such tragedies. The spirit and the text of \r\nthe Declaration — which is neither long nor \r\ncomplicated — reflect the best ingredients for peace: \r\ntolerance, respect for diversity and the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nIndeed, today, 60 years later, there is no better solution: \r\nusing these three avenues is the best way to reduce \r\ntension, to explain misunderstandings and to come to \r\nthe realization that the values of humanity unite us in \r\nall our differences, which enrich our shared existence.  \r\n If we are to be tolerant in our words and deeds \r\nand to appreciate the differences of others, we have to \r\nknow ourselves, and we have to understand our \r\ndifferences. For that, we need dialogue. Where there is \r\n A/62/PV.17\r\n \r\n29 07-52846 \r\n \r\nno genuine and open dialogue across religious and \r\ncultural lines, there is space for prejudice. Only \r\ndialogue facilitates mutual understanding, which \r\nprevents violence and plays an important role in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and the prevention of conflict. \r\nAs the UNESCO Constitution states, “since wars begin \r\nin the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the \r\ndefences of peace must be constructed”.  \r\n In order to lead a genuine dialogue, one must \r\ncome to it with an open mind and listen to others. To \r\ncreate the conditions for a free, spontaneous and \r\nfruitful dialogue that reflects the variety of opinions in \r\na society, we must ensure freedom of expression, \r\npluralism and free participation by civil society and the \r\npublic.  \r\n We need to learn about all cultures and religions. \r\nIndeed, we need to learn the art of leading a dialogue. \r\nEducation for tolerance must not be limited to school \r\neducation. In our efforts, we should include all of \r\nsociety, not only young people, although their role in \r\ncrossing traditional borders and in being willing to \r\naccept the value of differences cannot be \r\nunderestimated. We must further include journalists, \r\nteachers and all members of the public.  \r\n In supporting dialogue, cooperation, tolerance \r\nand education, the United Nations has played and must \r\ncontinue to play a crucial and instrumental role. \r\nTolerance is one of the key principles on which the \r\nUnited Nations was founded in its struggle for a \r\npeaceful future. The closer we come together in our \r\nglobalized world, the more important our \r\nunderstanding and our capacity for intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogue will become.  \r\n For that reason, we were pleased to participate in \r\nthe informal thematic debate on “Civilizations and the \r\nChallenge for Peace: Obstacles and Opportunities”, \r\nheld during the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly. We would like to commend the President of \r\nthe Assembly at its sixty-first session, Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, for organizing that event, which \r\nwas in the right direction, as it encouraged genuine \r\ndialogue.  \r\n We would like to pay special tribute to the work \r\nof the Alliance of Civilizations and to take this \r\nopportunity to express our full support for Mr. Jorge \r\nSampaio, High Representative for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, and for his efforts. We also fully support \r\nthe activities of UNESCO. We participate actively in \r\nthose and other valuable projects and programmes. We \r\nwelcome opportunities to learn more about others, and \r\nwe are prepared to support genuine dialogue in all \r\nbodies of the United Nations. \r\n Once we have succeeded in learning how to lead \r\nan open, friendly and genuine dialogue among our \r\ncultures and religions and to promote the principles of \r\ntolerance, non-discrimination, respect and protection of \r\nthe human rights of every individual in our societies, \r\nwe will be on the way to achieving the goals enshrined \r\nin the United Nations Charter.  \r\n In conclusion, let me assure the Assembly that the \r\nCzech Republic is prepared to contribute actively to \r\nthe achievement of our common goal of promoting \r\ninterreligious and intercultural understanding and \r\ncooperation for peace. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Lyubomir Kyuchukov, Deputy Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Bulgaria. \r\n Mr. Kyuchukov (Bulgaria): On behalf of the \r\nBulgarian Government, I commend the convening of \r\ntoday’s High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace. \r\nI will try to be very concrete, practical and pragmatic. \r\n Bulgaria’s historical experience is one of \r\ntolerance among its citizens, irrespective of their \r\nreligious denomination and cultural heritage. My \r\ncountry is at the crossroads between Christianity and \r\nIslam. Bulgarians, Turks, Jews, Roma, Armenians and \r\nother ethnic groups form the modern Bulgarian nation \r\nand are proud that ethnic and religious tolerance has \r\nalways prevailed and that Bulgaria was one of the two \r\nEuropean States where, even in the most turbulent \r\nhistorical moments — such as the Second World \r\nWar — Jews were saved from deportation by their \r\nfellow countrymen.  \r\n In recent times, Bulgaria has embodied the model \r\nof transition that is characterized by preserving ethnic \r\nand religious peace. Everyone can understand what that \r\nmeans when we look at the map of South-East Europe \r\nand the western Balkans in post-Yugoslavia times. That \r\nis not to say that we feel immune, yet tolerance \r\nremains predominant at the societal level — a genuine \r\ncharacteristic of the national mentality. \r\n That is why we supported and will consistently \r\ncontinue to support the Alliance of Civilizations. I take \r\nthis opportunity to extend congratulations to the High \r\nA/62/PV.17  \r\n \r\n07-52846 30 \r\n \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, President Jorge Sampaio, and \r\nto wish him success, in which we all have a stake and \r\nto which we can all contribute. As a member of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations Group of Friends, Bulgaria is \r\ncurrently developing its national action plan.  \r\n The success of the noble endeavour of \r\nintercultural dialogue depends to a great extent on the \r\ninteraction between the United Nations and relevant \r\nregional organizations. The European Union, in \r\npartnership with the United Nations and on its own, is \r\na factor for the promotion of interfaith and intercultural \r\nunderstanding. Bulgaria strongly supports the ongoing \r\ninitiatives aimed at promoting peaceful coexistence \r\nand cooperation, such as the Euromed Barcelona \r\nprocess, with its Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean \r\nFoundation for Dialogue between Cultures, the Black \r\nSea Synergy, and the European Union Strategy on \r\nCentral Asia. Bulgaria joined the Asia-Europe Meeting \r\n(ASEM) Forum and intends to participate in the ASEM \r\nInterfaith Dialogue. \r\n We also welcome the declaration of 2008 as the \r\nEuropean Year of Intercultural Dialogue, meant, \r\ninter alia, to bring about a better integration of \r\nminority groups and faith-based communities, in \r\nparticular Muslim communities in non-Muslim \r\nenvironments. I should like to refer to a specific \r\nexample. \r\n Like elsewhere in Europe, in Bulgaria the \r\nGovernment and civil society attribute great \r\nimportance to the integration of the Roma population. \r\nAmple proof of such joint action was the Decade of \r\nRoma Inclusion initiative. Conceived by the United \r\nNations Development Programme, it was supported by \r\nnine Governments from Central and South-East \r\nEurope. It marked the first attempt on an international \r\nscale at joint action aimed at improving the lives of the \r\n \r\nRoma in Europe. The Decade was officially announced \r\nin 2005 in Sofia. In the course of the Bulgarian \r\npresidency of the Decade, the first monitoring report \r\nwas prepared by Roma civil society organizations and \r\nreleased in Sofia in June this year. \r\n The region of South-East Europe represents a \r\ncrossroads of cultural and religious diversity. The \r\nBulgarian chairmanship-in-office of the South-East \r\nEuropean Cooperation Process is an opportunity for us \r\nto contribute in an even more active manner to the \r\nconsolidation of stability, because intercultural, \r\ninterethnic and interfaith dialogue in our region means \r\nnothing less than peace, stability and security. \r\n Guided by such an approach, we launched and \r\nhelped to materialize concrete steps to enhance direct \r\ndialogue between Belgrade and Pristina at the level of \r\nministers of culture, leading to the restoration and \r\npreservation of cultural and religious monuments in \r\nKosovo. In 2003, the President of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria, Georgi Parvanov, launched the idea of a joint \r\nproject on cultural corridors in South-East Europe, \r\nintended to promote, together with UNESCO, the \r\ncenturies-old connections between the peoples of the \r\nregion that today form the basis for better regional \r\ncooperation and development. Several regional forums \r\ntraced a road map to a new kind of attitude and \r\ninterpretation of the rich cultural heritage of the region. \r\n We therefore firmly support international efforts, \r\nincluding the unique role of the United Nations, to \r\npromote development, peace and security through \r\ninternational cooperation and intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogue. Today’s forum could make a \r\ndifference if it helps us get closer to a consensus in that \r\nrespect. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
