(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 7 (continued) \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\n  Letter dated 4 October 2007 from the Chairman \r\nof the Committee on Conferences addressed to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly \r\n(A/62/338/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The President: Before giving floor to the first \r\nspeaker, I would like to invite the attention of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to document A/62/338/Add.1, \r\ncontaining a letter dated 4 October 2007 from the \r\nChairman of the Committee on Conferences addressed \r\nto the President of the General Assembly.  \r\n Members are aware that, pursuant to section I, \r\nparagraph 7, of Assembly resolution 40/243 of \r\n18 December 1985, no subsidiary organ of the General \r\nAssembly should be permitted to meet at United \r\nNations Headquarters during the main part of the \r\nregular session of the Assembly unless explicitly \r\nauthorized by the Assembly.  \r\n Members will recall that, at its 1st plenary \r\nmeeting of the sixty-second session, held on \r\n18 September 2007, the General Assembly authorized a \r\nnumber of subsidiary organs to meet during the main \r\npart of the regular session of the Assembly.  \r\n Authorization is now sought for the Executive \r\nBoard of the United Nations Development Programme \r\nand the United Nations Population Fund to hold one \r\nmeeting during the main part of the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly, on the strict \r\nunderstanding that the meeting would be \r\naccommodated within available facilities and services.  \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to authorize the Executive Board of the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund to hold one meeting \r\nduring the main part of the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly? \r\n  It was so decided. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation \r\nfor Peace \r\n \r\nAgenda item 49 (continued) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/62/97 and \r\nA/62/337) \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mr. H.E. Seif \r\nAli Iddi, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania.  \r\n Mr. Iddi (United Republic of Tanzania): The \r\nGovernment of the United Republic of Tanzania is \r\npleased to participate in this dialogue on interreligious \r\nand intercultural cooperation. This meeting has come at \r\nan opportune time, when we need to encourage new \r\nthinking and dialogue on making the world more \r\npeaceful by building bridges among interfaith and \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 2 \r\n \r\nmulticultural institutions and by strengthening shared \r\nsimilarities among different faiths. \r\n We thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ninformative reports on this agenda item. We welcome \r\nthe civil society hearing, as we believe that the civil \r\nsociety is a key partner in our resolve to promote \r\ninterreligious and intercultural cooperation for peace.  \r\n The importance of dialogue and tolerance \r\nbetween religions and cultures to achieve peace in this \r\nglobalized world cannot be overemphasized at a time \r\nwhen there are extremists bent on exploiting cultural \r\nand religious differences. We are thus encouraged that \r\nvarious initiatives are being undertaken by various \r\norganizations to promote interreligious and \r\nintercultural cooperation. Furthermore we commend \r\nthe efforts undertaken by the United Nations system \r\nand in particular the leading role provided by the \r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization in promoting interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation in their \r\nprogrammes. The United Nations should use its \r\nstrategic convening advantage to lead the world in this \r\nendeavour.  \r\n The Government of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania acknowledges the initiatives of the \r\nGovernments of Spain and Turkey in the formation of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations. We congratulate \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio on his appointment as the High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance.  \r\n We support the Alliance of Civilizations as a \r\ncredible and viable attempt to diminish the dangerous \r\ntensions between diverse societies and their threat to \r\ninternational stability. The recommendations contained \r\nin the report of the High-level Group for the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations warrant our serious consideration. We \r\nlook forward to receiving the report on the work of the \r\nAlliance as well as to its first international forum, to be \r\nheld in Spain in 2008.  \r\n In Tanzania interreligious and intercultural \r\ncooperation is integrally woven into the social fabric of \r\nour nation. Tanzania is home to different races, more \r\nthan 100 ethnic groups and several religions which \r\ncoexist in harmony, with full freedom to express their \r\ncultural and religious diversity. Long before our \r\nindependence, in 1961 for Tanzania Mainland and in \r\n1964 for Zanzibar, our founding fathers of the \r\nindependence movement deliberately focused on \r\nnational unity by highlighting the assets of unity, such \r\nas a common language.  \r\n After independence, there have been conscious \r\nefforts to nurture unity in diversity through innovative \r\nnational policies that promote and encourage a culture \r\nof tolerance and peaceful coexistence among our \r\npeople. Several measures were taken by the \r\nGovernment in that regard. The most effective measure \r\nto address and dampen the politicization of religious \r\nand other identities included policies that promoted the \r\nprinciple of equity, particularly through access to \r\neducation. \r\n The institutions responsible for administering \r\njustice were also reformed to ensure that they \r\naccommodated the needs and aspirations of diverse \r\ngroups. Furthermore, legal provisions were instituted \r\nforbidding the formation of organizations, such as \r\npolitical parties, that foment and amplify divisions \r\nbased on race, religion or tribe. That separation of \r\nreligion, race and ethnicity from politics has enabled \r\nTanzania to have peacefully held four presidential \r\nelections. \r\n The Constitution of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania pronounces Tanzania a secular State. The \r\nConstitution further provides for the right of every \r\ncitizen to exercise the freedom of worship and to join \r\nor leave any religion of their choice. Moreover, \r\nreligious tolerance is emphasized. Our penal code does \r\nnot allow behaviour that is injurious to religious \r\nliberty. It should be underscored that the Government \r\nof Tanzania greatly values freedom of expression, but \r\nthat freedom should be exercised with respect for other \r\nreligions and cultures. \r\n The Government has also undertaken measures to \r\nbuild a culture of peace and unity. That has been \r\naccomplished through many avenues, such as media \r\nmessages, school curricula and our national unifying \r\nsymbols and heritage, including our national heroes \r\nand youth movements. The Government has further \r\nencouraged and assisted religious organizations in \r\nholding dialogues amongst themselves. To this end, \r\nMuslim and Christian leaders in Tanzania have formed \r\na joint Commission on Peace, Development and \r\nReconciliation. It is a forum for dialogue and has \r\ncontributed to engendering understanding and \r\naccommodation.  \r\n In addition, religious leaders and organizations \r\nhave worked hand-in-hand with the Government in \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n3 07-53003 \r\n \r\ncombating social problems that could be avenues for \r\ndisenchantment and thus provide recruiting grounds for \r\nradical fringe elements in society, sowing seeds of \r\nmisunderstanding and discord in society. We should not \r\nunderestimate the capacity of those elements to \r\ndevelop divisive ideologies to incite and exploit social \r\ndeprivation, poverty and religious differences in order \r\nto advocate violence. Those people and groups \r\ntranscend national and international boundaries. We \r\nmust endeavour to address the root causes of \r\nfrustrations that could be the breeding ground for racial \r\npolitics and ideologies in the name of religion. \r\n Religious intolerance is fuelled by ignorance of \r\nwhat other faiths stand for. It is that ignorance that is \r\nexploited by those who have an agenda seeking to \r\nadvance political goals through violence justified on \r\nreligious grounds. Therefore, increased education and \r\ncommunication aimed at promoting better \r\nunderstanding and tolerance should be accorded a high \r\npriority by all of us. \r\n Concerted efforts from all of us are needed as we \r\ndeal with religiously motivated political violence and \r\nterrorism. The Government of Tanzania reiterates its \r\nreadiness to share our national experience in order to \r\nfurther this dialogue, with a view to promoting \r\nunderstanding and tolerance among diverse cultures \r\nand religions in order to contribute towards world \r\npeace and security. \r\n The President: I now call on H.E. Mr. Anton \r\nNiculescu, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nRomania. \r\n Mr. Niculescu (Romania): I am deeply honoured \r\nto address the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious \r\nand Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for \r\nPeace. I would like to begin by thanking the President \r\nof the General Assembly for organizing this Dialogue \r\non one of the most important issues of our time. \r\n Romania fully endorses the statement of the \r\nPortuguese presidency of the European Union, which \r\nwas made yesterday.  \r\n In an increasingly globalized world, where we \r\nlive together and interact with each other, intercultural \r\ndialogue will be a permanent process requiring \r\nworldwide participation at all levels. We must put \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue at the top of \r\nour political agenda, because no progress is possible \r\nwithout joint responsibility and a sharing of the task by \r\nall. We welcome foremost the interactive hearing \r\ninvolving representatives of civil society as an \r\nimportant part of our debate. \r\n The rich cultural diversity of my country could \r\nnot have been better illustrated than by the logo chosen \r\nfor the city of Sibiu, which, along with Luxemburg, is \r\nthe 2007 European Capital of Culture: “Sibiu — City \r\nof Culture — City of Cultures”. The geographical \r\nposition of Romania at the crossroads of Central and \r\nSouth-Eastern European cultures is reflected in both \r\nthe variety and the richness of our cultural diversity. \r\nThe social landscape is characterized by a variety of \r\ncultural traditions, including Hungarian, Roma, \r\nGerman, Ukrainian, Jewish, Turkish, Tartar, Russian, \r\nSerbian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Greek, Polish, Italian, \r\nArmenian and Croatian. \r\n Romania is also a place of peaceful coexistence \r\nbetween different religions and confessions: Orthodox, \r\nRoman and Greek Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, Muslim \r\nand others. The churches and religious communities \r\ncontribute to better harmony among people by \r\npromoting mutual respect within the framework of \r\nshared fundamental values. The Romanian Government \r\nis working closely with religious communities in \r\npromoting interreligious dialogue.  \r\n In this context, in September 2007, Romania \r\nhosted the Third European Ecumenical Assembly for \r\nthe first time in a largely Orthodox country. The \r\nAssembly gathered a large number of representatives, \r\nnot only from European institutions, countries and \r\nchurches, but also representatives of Muslim and \r\nJewish communities in Europe, as well as from \r\nchurches in America, Asia and Africa. The Assembly’s \r\nmessage, adopted in Sibiu, encourages peaceful \r\ndialogue between religions, better knowledge of all \r\nreligions, and respect for freedom of religion, human \r\ndignity and human rights. \r\n Romania welcomes the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nand expresses its full support and willingness to be \r\nassociated with its activities, for we think the Alliance \r\nhas great potential to promote peace by means of \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. We are fully \r\nsatisfied with the conclusions of the first ministerial \r\nmeeting of the group of friends, which took place last \r\nweek, and we consider the Alliance ready to make a \r\nmajor step forward in achieving tangible results. \r\n As the Presidency of the European Union stated \r\nearlier, we think that Europe, along with other regions \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 4 \r\n \r\nof the world, could play a key role in reaching the \r\nobjectives of the Alliance of Civilizations. History has \r\nshaped Europe as a multicultural, multi-ethnic and \r\nmultireligious continent. However, today’s new \r\nrealities, including migration and globalization, will \r\nenrich its physiognomy even more.  \r\n Romania, now at a happy turning point in its \r\nhistory, is changing even faster and becoming more \r\nurban, more open, deeply democratic and more \r\nmulticultural. Thus, the European Year of Intercultural \r\nDialogue, to be organized by the European Union next \r\nyear, represents a great opportunity for my country to \r\ndeal with the more complex cultural environment and \r\nto acquire new intercultural dialoguing skills through \r\ncontacts with other European countries and \r\nneighbouring regions. Yet, in my opinion, one of the \r\nmost important results of the European Year will be the \r\nunderstanding of our unity in diversity and the \r\nawareness that different cultures, religions and beliefs \r\nare bound to enrich our lives and reflect the same \r\nuniversal values.  \r\n In that regard, Romania has already prepared a \r\nnational strategy for intercultural dialogue with a \r\nspecial focus on the involvement of civil society, \r\nespecially young people and children. Romania has \r\nalso participated in the project of the Council of \r\nEurope, working on its white paper on intercultural \r\ndialogue, which seeks to develop a coherent policy \r\naimed at promoting intercultural dialogue within \r\nEurope and with its neighbours.  \r\n I would like to refer to my own region, the Black \r\nSea region, a distinct geographical area strategically \r\nlocated at the intersection of Europe, Central Asia and \r\nthe Middle East. This area, characterized by countries \r\nwith very different histories and cultures, has many \r\nopportunities, but also faces challenges and difficulties \r\nthat require a comprehensive response. In our view, \r\ngiven the confluence of cultures in the Black Sea area, \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue could play an \r\nincreasingly important role in advancing regional \r\ncooperation and in solving some of the regional \r\ndifficulties.  \r\n Therefore, we consider that international \r\ninitiatives in the field of intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue, including those carried out under the aegis of \r\nthe United Nations, can be beneficial. In this context, \r\nwe intend to propose a project aiming to promote the \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue in the Black \r\nSea region, which could be developed in cooperation \r\nwith the Alliance of Civilizations.  \r\n The Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity \r\nadopted by the heads of States from the South-East \r\nEurope region in Bucharest on 7 June 2007 describes \r\nmulticulturalism as not only a multitude of cultures \r\nwith equal status, but also a system based on common \r\nvalues and the development of peace, and \r\ninterculturality as the constant interaction between \r\ncultures in the spirit of building bridges among \r\npeoples. \r\n I hope that our debate will contribute to \r\nstrengthening our commitment for peace, and that other \r\nsimilar initiatives will follow aimed at broadening our \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nHans Winkler, State Secretary for European and \r\nInternational Affairs of Austria.  \r\n Mr. Winkler (Austria): Austria fully supports the \r\nstatement by the Presidency of the European Union but \r\nwould like to add a few thoughts.  \r\n The existence of intolerance, racism and other \r\nforms of discrimination is an undeniable fact. Such \r\nphenomena exist in all our countries and increasingly \r\nso. The news we encounter almost every day is most \r\nalarming: immigrants or asylum seekers are being \r\nharassed or attacked; debates about publications that \r\nare offensive to some, while others insist on the \r\nprinciple of freedom of expression, get out of hand and \r\nsometimes even lead to outbursts of violence. \r\nReligious symbols are becoming a matter of \r\ncontention. In short, interreligious and intercultural \r\nrelations within societies and beyond national borders \r\nare becoming strained.  \r\n The disquieting truth is that all of this is \r\nhappening despite the laudable efforts of many well-\r\nestablished organizations and institutions that work to \r\ncombat various forms of intolerance, despite numerous \r\nstudies, reports and despite a seemingly endless \r\nnumber of resolutions and action plans.  \r\n Must we then throw up our hands and, \r\ndiscouraged, admit defeat, discontinue our efforts and \r\naccept the state of affairs as it is? The answer is \r\nobvious: of course not! We must not leave the field to \r\nthose who sow discord and preach hate and \r\nintolerance. By giving up our fight against intolerance \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n5 07-53003 \r\n \r\nand bigotry, we would leave those who want to destroy \r\nour values victorious.  \r\n Today we have the chance and the duty to learn \r\nfrom the mistakes and omissions of the past. Whether \r\nreligiously, racially or economically motivated, \r\nwhether in the East, West, North or South, we must \r\nstand up against all forms of extremism and the abuse \r\nof religious convictions and cultural traditions.  \r\n Dialogue is the indispensable fabric that holds \r\neach democratic society together and is the prerequisite \r\nfor the peaceful coexistence of different cultures and \r\nreligions. Dialogue communicates what unites us but \r\nalso what irritates us. \r\n Austria is committed to protecting and promoting \r\ncultural diversity in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance. \r\nEach country has special challenges to meet. While the \r\nproblems are global, the answers must be made to fit \r\nthe particular situations in each country.  \r\n We in Austria have a longstanding tradition as a \r\nplatform for meaningful dialogue between religions \r\nand civilizations, in particular between Christianity and \r\nIslam. We will continue to remain engaged, because we \r\nknow that we are not immune against the challenges \r\nthat many countries in Europe and elsewhere are facing \r\ntoday.  \r\n We believe that the United Nations is the best \r\nframework to promote such a dialogue on a global \r\nscale by setting standards, including legal standards, \r\nand by being the vanguard in the protection of human \r\nrights. States bear a large share of the responsibility to \r\nfight intolerance and discrimination. It is incumbent \r\nupon them to create the legal and institutional \r\nframework in which discrimination can be prevented \r\nor, if need be, in which transgressions will ultimately \r\nbe prosecuted and punished by independent courts. By \r\nthe same token, political leadership is required to \r\nensure the necessary political, social and economic \r\nframework where free citizens can exercise their rights \r\nand are protected against violence and aggression.  \r\n The State cannot, however, shoulder this \r\nresponsibility alone. Civil society plays an important \r\npart, and religious leaders have to assume a special \r\nresponsibility, as was underlined very eloquently \r\nyesterday by Minister Alkalaj of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, and by others. The fundamental values \r\ninherent in all world religions clearly mandate all such \r\nleaders to explicitly reject the preaching of hate and \r\nincitement to violence. Radicalization, disguised in \r\nreligious terms, seems to take place in a kind of \r\n“identity vacuum”, where young people who lack \r\nsocial or economic perspectives struggle with their \r\nown identity.  \r\n It is easy to produce clichés and misrepresent \r\nwhat is foreign. Mutual trust, on the other hand, is \r\nmuch more difficult to achieve. Nobody is born a \r\nterrorist or an extremist and that is true for all religions \r\nand ideologies. Education is the key to reaching out to \r\nthe hearts and minds of young people. Access to \r\nknowledge and information and clear perspectives are \r\nthe driving force for change in society and for a \r\npeaceful and secure coexistence of all citizens. \r\n Like many countries, we have tried to find our \r\nown answers by learning from the best practices of \r\nothers. For instance, a number of steps have been taken \r\nto promote dialogue with Islam. University master’s \r\ndegree programmes on Islamic religious pedagogy, the \r\nestablishment of faculties of Islamic theology, as well \r\nas imam training programmes at European universities \r\nand teacher training colleges are just some examples \r\nwhich might facilitate a fruitful dialogue.  \r\n Dialogue also needs structure and continuity. \r\nReturning to the example of my own country, the \r\nAustrian Government, together with the Islamic \r\ncommunity in Austria, recently initiated and supported \r\na conference of European imams in Vienna. The \r\ndeclaration adopted on that occasion clearly states the \r\nnecessity of developing a Muslim-European identity \r\nand leaves no doubt as to the compatibility of Islam, \r\ndemocracy, rule of law and fundamental freedoms. The \r\ndeclaration also addresses gender issues and states, \r\ninter alia, that any kind of violation of women’s rights \r\nshould be strongly censured: forced marriage, genital \r\nmutilation, honour killings and violence within the \r\nfamily have no foundation in Islam. \r\n It is clear that women, and this is true of all \r\nsocieties, have an important role to play in this \r\ndialogue, both in community work and in politics in \r\ngeneral, including in international peace processes. In \r\nMay of this year, Ms. Ursula Plassnik, the Austrian \r\nForeign Minister, hosted a conference of women \r\nleaders networking for peace and security in the \r\nMiddle East with a number of eminent persons from \r\ndifferent countries in the region. The clear message \r\nfrom this conference was that women are ready to \r\nreach out to each other across national, ethnic and \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 6 \r\n \r\nreligious barriers and to engage in constructive \r\ndialogue. \r\n We have no time to lose. Otherwise we risk \r\nseeing our societies taken hostage by extremists on all \r\nsides. The success or failure of our efforts today will \r\ndetermine the future of our children. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Aly Maher Elsayed, Special Representative of the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt. \r\n Mr. Elsayed (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to represent the Arab Republic of \r\nEgypt in this High-level Dialogue. I would like to say \r\nat the outset that holding this dialogue in the United \r\nNations is essential to the realization of much-desired \r\npeace in the world. \r\n While religions may differ in some aspects of \r\ndoctrine, they undoubtedly share common values and \r\nprinciples regarding respect for human beings and \r\nhuman dignity and life. In essence, they reject violence \r\nand war. Therefore, dialogue should begin by \r\naddressing these common values, not matters of \r\nrapprochement or integration of faiths. What we really \r\nneed is understanding and rapprochement between \r\npeople in different communities. \r\n We are all aware that the phrase used to greet \r\npeople in Islam, the religion of tolerance, is \r\n“al-salaamu alaikum” (“peace be upon you”). The word \r\n“peace” is in itself one of God’s Holy Names. \r\nMoreover, the teachings of Christianity revere the \r\nmeaning of peace and call for its reign on earth, while \r\n“shalom”, the Hebrew word for “peace”, is used to \r\ngreet people in Judaism.  \r\n Hence, those who attempt to exploit religions and \r\ncultures to justify violence are in fact undermining \r\nsuch religions and their lofty messages. Dialogue alone \r\ncan build bridges between peoples, regardless of \r\ndifferences of belief and conception. It also allows for \r\nlearning about the other, both within groups and as \r\nindividuals, and for the understanding and acceptance \r\nof the other. Individuals are usually wary of what they \r\ndo not know and fear what they do not understand. \r\nDialogue, accordingly, is the appropriate approach for \r\nlearning, understanding, rapprochement and \r\ncooperation for the attainment of common goals, \r\nparticularly in the twenty-first century, the era of \r\nglobalization, where no culture can afford to become \r\nisolationist or to avoid interaction with other cultures. \r\n Peace is not merely a philosophy or a lofty \r\nprinciple. It is a way of life and constitutes civilized \r\nconduct for the good of humankind. It is therefore \r\nimperative that we all commit ourselves to the \r\nfoundations of peace, which are inseparable from \r\nrespect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms \r\nfor all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or \r\nreligion, in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Respect for cultural identities is the point of \r\ndeparture for the successful conclusion of our dialogue, \r\nas it will generate acceptance by all for interaction that \r\nencourages mutual understanding, spreading the spirit \r\nof tolerance and utilizing the capabilities of new \r\ninformation technology to disseminate knowledge and \r\ncorrect stereotypes and misconceptions. \r\n Our human civilization and common heritage rest \r\non the valuable contributions of all civilizations and \r\ncultures. I recall here the great role of Muslim \r\nscientists, philosophers and writers, among them, for \r\nexample, al-Khawarizmi, al-Razi, al-Farabi, Alhazen, \r\nand Ibn Khaldun, to mention only a few. Regrettably, \r\nsome seek to identify Islam with extremism, violence \r\nand terrorism, while Islam is innocent of all these \r\nallegations. \r\n The preamble to the constitution of the United \r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization declares that “since wars begin in the \r\nminds of men, it is in the minds of men that the \r\ndefences of peace must be constructed”. Dialogue is \r\nthe best way of achieving that goal. \r\n I would also like to add that this dialogue is not \r\nthe concern of Governments or religious leaders alone. \r\nIt is, rather, the concern of each and every individual in \r\nour societies, all non-governmental organizations, all \r\nthinkers and writers, and all who are truly concerned \r\nabout the future of mankind. The most perilous \r\nchallenge to international peace and security is the \r\nproliferation of violence and the use of force as a \r\nmeans of expression, especially in light of the inability \r\nand failure of the international community — and I \r\napologize for saying this — as represented in the \r\nUnited Nations, to settle chronic political and \r\neconomic problems. Such failures breed feelings of \r\ninjustice, oppression and double standards and promote \r\ncompetitiveness over materialistic and political gains.  \r\n These are all catalysts for conflict, not for \r\ndialogue, and require us to double our efforts within \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n7 07-53003 \r\n \r\nthis Organization to settle these conflicts and assist \r\ndeveloping countries in realizing the legitimate \r\naspirations of their peoples for development and \r\nprosperity, without attached conditions, and within an \r\ninternational framework characterized by democracy \r\nand equality, free from politicization and selectivity. \r\nIndeed, only through collective action and dialogue can \r\nwe achieve the desired results. \r\n In recent years a number of bodies and \r\nconferences have addressed the issue of interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue. That in itself is a positive \r\nelement, provided that we coordinate the various \r\ninitiatives, so that they work in tandem and do not \r\ncompete or work at cross purposes. \r\n In Egypt, we are currently preparing for the \r\nmeetings and workshops of next year’s Dialogue \r\nAmong Peoples and Cultures of the Mediterranean and \r\nthe Gulf, to be held in Alexandria. The Institute for \r\nPeace Studies, chaired by Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Suzanne Mubarak, was designated to organize \r\nthis third gathering, following the first such event, held \r\nin Paris under the patronage of former President \r\nJacques Chirac, and the second, held in Seville, Spain. \r\n This dialogue should translate our common \r\nendeavour to promote tolerance, respect for religions \r\nand beliefs and cultural diversity into a concrete plan \r\nof action and practical and viable programmes. We \r\nhave high hopes that the General Assembly Dialogue \r\nwill result in concerted action aimed at mutual \r\nunderstanding, bridging gaps and the acceptance of the \r\nother. In this regard, Egypt is fully ready to contribute \r\nto and participate in this process. \r\n The President: I call next on His Excellency \r\nMr. Fedja Starčević, Assistant Minister for Multilateral \r\nAffairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia. \r\n Mr. Starčević (Serbia): In a world where no \r\ncountry is perfectly homogeneous, calls for the \r\nrecognition of different ethnic, religious and language \r\ngroups and values have increased. What is needed is to \r\ndevelop a sense of respect for the other, which would \r\nserve as a basis for mutual respect, understanding and \r\nknowledge. UNESCO calls it “tolerance”, even though \r\nthat word does not seem to include all the necessary \r\ningredients. Yet, the practical understanding of \r\ntolerance does indeed include this sense of respect that \r\nwe seek to increase. \r\n There is potentially no greater agent of tolerance \r\nthan religion. All religions preach morality, civility, \r\nkindness, compassion, love, tolerance and peace. So \r\nprominent is the teaching of universal love among all \r\nreligions that it could be taken as a common goal of \r\nthem all. Yet, religion has been often misused in the \r\ncause of division, discrimination and death. It is \r\nsometimes turned from a personal matter of faith and \r\nsustenance into a weapon of power and coercion. From \r\nwar to discrimination and other violations of human \r\nrights, what we see all too frequently is a lack of \r\ntolerance and understanding between religious \r\ntraditions. \r\n But one thing should be clear: religions \r\nthemselves are not to blame. The problem is usually \r\nnot with the faith, but with the faithful. Each religion is \r\na path towards the same goal of salvation, and \r\ntherefore each religion must be given utmost respect. \r\nNo one religion can claim monopoly and say that it is \r\nthe only way to the truth. All great religions are equal \r\nstreams of civilized human coexistence, parallel \r\ndepositories of spiritual wisdom and complementary \r\nsources of social guidance. All must therefore learn to \r\ngive due respect to each other and to each other’s view \r\nof human life. The key to this is to foster knowledge, \r\nunderstanding and profound respect for all the world’s \r\nspiritual traditions. \r\n Diversity of religious and cultural heritage is, at \r\nthe same time, a characteristic of one’s identity and a \r\nmeans of reconciliation. The latter is particularly \r\nrelevant for South-Eastern Europe, which experienced \r\nethnic and civil wars and devastation at the end of the \r\ntwentieth century. \r\n People in our region, the Balkans, have \r\nthroughout history faced many confrontations of \r\ncivilizations: mighty empires vied with each other for \r\nsupremacy over our territories. And those conflicts \r\noften had a religious dimension as well. As a result, \r\nthis created an ambivalent cultural, psychological and \r\npolitical legacy, where people of other customs and \r\nfaiths were looked at with both mistrust and fear. \r\nHowever, there followed a long period in the former \r\nYugoslavia when coexistence and tolerance were \r\nfostered. Yugoslav nations, divided between Eastern \r\nOrthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism, Islam \r\nand Judaism, learned to live side by side and created a \r\nnew political and cultural identity for themselves. \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 8 \r\n \r\n The harmony thus created was destroyed by the \r\nsurge of nationalism in the 1990s. However, the \r\npeoples and the new States that emerged in the territory \r\nthat was Yugoslavia, following normalization of \r\nrelations among them, have all turned to the promotion \r\nof democracy and respect for human rights, and they \r\nhave jointly committed themselves to reconciliation, \r\ncooperation and European integration. \r\n For the Republic of Serbia, as a multi-ethnic and \r\nmultireligious society, such an orientation is of \r\nparamount importance. Our constitution and our laws \r\nguarantee equality on ethnic, religious or every other \r\nground. Religious communities carry out their \r\nactivities in Serbia in full freedom. Religious \r\naffiliation is a private matter for every individual and \r\nbelongs to the body of individual human rights. \r\n In cooperation with other countries of the \r\nWestern Balkans and of South-Eastern Europe, with the \r\nsupport and assistance of European and international \r\norganizations, Serbia has made considerable efforts to \r\npromote dialogue and reconciliation in our region, with \r\na view to strengthening peace, cooperation and \r\nstability. Encouraging results have been achieved, so \r\nmuch so that the Balkans is increasingly viewed as a \r\nregion of fruitful cooperation instead of conflict, as in \r\nthe past.  \r\n An important role in this regard has been played \r\nby both governmental institutions and civil society. \r\nUNESCO initiated the first Summit of heads of State of \r\nthe South-East Europe region, which was held in \r\nOhrid, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in \r\n2003. That was the first time that all heads of State of \r\nthe region had gathered together since the outbreak of \r\nconflicts in the Balkans.  \r\n Since then, South-East Europe Summits are held \r\nevery year. The declaration adopted at the last South-\r\nEast Europe Summit, in Bucharest in June 2007, is an \r\nexpression of the efforts of the countries and peoples of \r\nthe region to develop cooperation in the field of culture \r\nin order to promote cultural diversity and knowledge of \r\none another as a bridge between cultural heritage and \r\nthe culture of the future. \r\n However, the current developments related to \r\nSerbia’s southern province of Kosovo are in stark \r\ncontrast to this constructive atmosphere of tolerance, \r\ndialogue, cooperation and interaction in the region. For \r\nthe last eight years, Kosovo, under the administration \r\nof the United Nations Interim Administration Mission \r\nin Kosovo, has been the single region in Europe where \r\nthe enjoyment of basic human rights has not been \r\npossible, as a result of the lack of security, freedom of \r\nmovement and work for the Serbian community. \r\nSerbian homes and churches have been demolished and \r\nacts of violence against Serbs and other non-Albanians \r\nhave been committed. Their continuous existence in \r\nKosovo has thus been put in jeopardy. \r\n In May 2005, UNESCO organized an \r\ninternational donors conference in Paris to protect and \r\nrestore cultural heritage in Kosovo. An inventory has \r\nbeen made of 48 Orthodox, 14 Muslim and 13 secular \r\nheritage sites to be protected and to be restored to their \r\nformer glory. Kosovo today is a region where these and \r\nsimilar activities, as well as all other possible measures \r\nto overcome fear and suspicion and increase \r\nconfidence and cooperation among different \r\ncommunities are most needed. Achieving positive \r\nresults in such activities would greatly improve the \r\nquality of life for all in Kosovo and would make the \r\nachievement of a constructive political solution more \r\npossible than is now the case. Serbia is ready and \r\nwilling to engage in such pursuits, guided by the desire \r\nto contribute to making all parts of the Balkan region a \r\nzone of friendship and cooperation. We hope and \r\nbelieve that our common future lies in that direction. \r\n Allow me to say in conclusion that Serbia will \r\ncontinue to support all activities aimed at interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue in the interest of peace and \r\nunderstanding in the world. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Pjer Šimunović, Assistant Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and European Integration of Croatia. \r\n Mr. Šimunović (Croatia): I am honoured to \r\naddress this meeting today, as it is further adding to the \r\npolitical importance that Member States and \r\ninternational organizations attach to the fundamentally \r\nimportant topic of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue. I would also like to thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor providing us with this opportunity to share and \r\nadvance our reflections and learn from each other’s \r\nexperiences. \r\n Croatia has been situated at the crossroads of \r\ndifferent cultures and religions for centuries. Today, it \r\nis still where Central and Eastern Europe meet the \r\nMediterranean and where Christianity meets Islam, \r\nproviding a rich cultural and religious diversity. \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n9 07-53003 \r\n \r\n Croatia is fully committed to combating \r\nintolerance and discrimination and to promoting \r\nmutual respect and understanding. At the national \r\nlevel, Croatia recognizes and protects freedom of \r\nreligion and belief as a fundamental human right, as \r\nstated in the constitution. We are proud to say that \r\nthere are 42 registered religious groups in Croatia, of \r\nwhich 14 enjoy direct annual financial support for their \r\nwork from the Government. All religious groups are \r\nindependent of the State. \r\n Each State has an obligation to protect freedom of \r\nreligion or belief and to guarantee to all religious \r\ncommunities the freedom to gather in places of \r\nworship. However, we must remember that a great part \r\nof responsibility for promoting interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding also lies in the hands of \r\nreligious leaders. It is their moral duty to spread the \r\nmessage of peace and cooperation with members of \r\nother religions in order to create a common future and \r\nsociety. Education, tolerance and respect for fellow \r\nhuman beings are means of creating a peaceful world. \r\nThat goal requires joint efforts at all levels — from the \r\ninternational and national levels down to the level of \r\nevery single person. \r\n Croatia welcomes and follows with great interest \r\nthe increased attention to the theme of interreligious \r\nand intercultural understanding by Governments, \r\nUnited Nations agencies, funds and programmes, \r\nreligious communities and civil society. Only through \r\nsuch partnerships can we find effective solutions. \r\n In that respect, allow me to welcome the work of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations and the appointment by \r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance of Civilizations, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jorge Sampaio, earlier this year. \r\n As a candidate for membership in the European \r\nUnion, Croatia aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by Portugal on behalf of the European Union. \r\nCroatia welcomes and supports the recent decision by \r\nthe European Union to declare 2008 the European Year \r\nof Intercultural Dialogue. Croatia is also following \r\nwith great interest the work done through the Euro-\r\nMediterranean Partnership and the European \r\nNeighbourhood Policy. \r\n Defending the freedom of religion and belief, as \r\nwell as cultural diversity, lies at the core of peace, \r\njustice and, consequently, security. As a candidate for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2008-\r\n2009, the Republic of Croatia is very well aware of that \r\nsensitive interdependence and stands ready to work \r\nwith other members for a peaceful, tolerant and \r\nconsiderate world. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Fahd Bin Abdulrahman Alrajeh, \r\nCapital Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia. \r\n Mr. Alrajeh (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nFirst, we would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. We are confident that you will \r\ndischarge your tasks with wisdom and skill. Also, we \r\nthank those who called for and organized this \r\nimportant meeting. \r\n We would like to contribute some ideas and \r\nencouragement on the subject of dialogue, which has \r\nits foundations in the Millennium Declaration of 2000 \r\n(resolution 55/2). There, tolerance was defined as an \r\nessential value for international relations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century and as a contribution to a culture of peace \r\nand dialogue among civilizations. Throughout history, \r\ndialogue per se has never been controversial; cultures \r\nmade use of it among themselves, and in that way \r\nhumanity gained stable values to which we all aspire, \r\nsuch as tolerance, coexistence, cooperation, the \r\nrejection of violence, hatred, discord, tension and \r\nvengeance and the nurturing of peace. \r\n Sadly, we have been late to submit this subject to \r\npublic debate, and it has been overtaken by \r\ndevelopments in human civilization: interests have \r\nbecome interdependent and the rights and duties of \r\npeoples and nations have become enshrined in law. \r\nStill, to speak about dialogue now is certainly better \r\nthan further delay. Clearly, talk of a “clash of \r\ncivilizations” is in response to those who promote \r\nterrorism, but it constitutes support for their schemes, \r\nespecially when they exploit religion for their evil \r\npurposes and in furtherance of economic and political \r\ninterests. To achieve a decisive victory over terrorism \r\nwe must successfully undermine extremist thinking \r\nthat rejects dialogue and coexistence. \r\n It is also essential that we adopt international \r\nlegislation calling for respect for religions and \r\ncriminalizing attacks on religious symbols. Saudi \r\nArabia also warns of exploitation of the counter-\r\nterrorism campaign by the forces of extremism and the \r\nadvocates of a clash among cultures and civilizations \r\nin order to divert the fight against terrorism from its \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 10 \r\n \r\ncourse and its objectives. Here, it is important to stress \r\nthat no religion calls for terrorism; all religions call for \r\nnoble values. It is not right to denounce a religion for \r\nthe offences of some extremists. \r\n The media bear an important responsibility to \r\ndisseminate correct ideas about other people while \r\navoiding stereotype, cliché, misconception and \r\nprejudgement. This can help bring about a successful \r\ndialogue among cultures and civilizations. \r\n Allow me to recall here that throughout history \r\nthe peoples of the Middle East have always built \r\ncultural bridges of contact and communication among \r\ncivilizations. Those countries have played a noble role \r\nin calling for the convening of many conferences at all \r\nlevels in order to strengthen the ideals of cooperation \r\nand tolerance among civilizations. \r\n At the national level, and convinced of the \r\nimportance of interaction with a world of many \r\ncultures and civilizations, of a culture of peace and of \r\nfinding common ground for cooperation among \r\ncivilizations, Saudi Arabia has called for a dialogue \r\namong civilizations in which all Muslim States would \r\nparticipate. \r\n The General Assembly consequently adopted \r\nresolution 53/42 on 14 January 1998, proclaiming the \r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations. That \r\nhas made it possible to shed light on the tolerant face \r\nof Islam and to create a culture of peace and \r\ncooperation among peoples of the world. \r\n Our King, the Servant of the Two Holy Places, \r\nhas often stressed the importance of dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, peaceful coexistence and of establishing \r\nlines of communication between peoples, as opposed to \r\nthe idea of confrontation and the clash of civilizations. \r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is continuing its efforts \r\nin this area by participating in national, regional and \r\ninternational initiatives such as the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and the Panel of the Wise. We also \r\nsupported the holding of the International Forum for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Dialogue among Civilizations in \r\nthe Third Millennium and have established a \r\nmultidisciplinary group of Saudi specialists to engage \r\nin dialogue with our foreign partners at the annual \r\nNational Festival of Heritage and Culture. We also \r\nsupport other initiatives on dialogue among \r\ncivilizations and the culture of peace, including \r\nwebsites and stamps, that promote and enhance the \r\nimportance of dialogue among civilizations. \r\n I now turn to the issue of religious and cultural \r\ntolerance. My country hosts more than 7 million \r\nforeigners of different religions and ethnicities, from \r\nmore than 70 countries, who enjoy full rights and live \r\nin dignity. While differences of position are a natural \r\nresult of diversity — even within a particular religion \r\nor culture — they should not lead to confrontations or \r\nclashes with that religion or culture. On the contrary, \r\nwe must find common ground for coexistence and \r\ncooperation, which humankind has managed to do \r\nthroughout the ages. We are confident that our project \r\non cultures and civilizations will succeed, thanks to the \r\nefforts of the Panel of the Wise, and that we will begin \r\na constructive and purposeful dialogue to consolidate \r\nthese values, which will enable everyone to benefit \r\nfrom peace and prosperity. If we achieve that, the \r\ncritics of this movement will not be able to ignore it. If \r\nwe are optimistic, the future will smile upon us. \r\n Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Spreading a culture of peace and tolerance is a \r\nglobal effort in which everyone must participate if we \r\nare to create a peaceful environment that will enable \r\nfuture generations to achieve progress, prosperity and \r\ncooperation. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call \r\nnext on His Excellency Mr. Art Jacobi, Director for \r\nHuman Rights and Good Governance of the Ministry \r\nof Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. \r\n Mr. Jacobi (Netherlands): In addition to the \r\nintervention made yesterday by the presidency of the \r\nEuropean Union, with which my delegation fully aligns \r\nitself, I would like to make a few observations from a \r\nmore national perspective. \r\n The Netherlands has a long-standing record in the \r\nfield of the international protection of freedom of \r\nreligion and belief. For instance, the Netherlands \r\nplayed an important role during the negotiations on the \r\n1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nIntolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or \r\nBelief (resolution 36/55). Its article 8 consists of the \r\nso-called Dutch clause, which states,  \r\n  “Nothing in the present Declaration shall be \r\nconstrued as restricting or derogating from any \r\nright defined in the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and the International Covenants on \r\nHuman Rights.” \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n11 07-53003 \r\n \r\n That principle remains as important today as it \r\nwas 25 years ago. It also applies to the subject of our \r\nmeeting: interreligious and intercultural understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace. The Netherlands \r\nGovernment fully supports the underlying idea that a \r\nglobal understanding of our cultural, social, ethnic and \r\nreligious backgrounds is more essential than ever, \r\nespecially because the world has become a global \r\nvillage. What happens in one part of the world affects \r\nother parts of the world: tensions among various \r\ngroups in our societies do not remain unnoticed abroad. \r\nHence, dialogue among all and at all levels — local, \r\nnational, regional and international — is a useful \r\ninstrument for promoting understanding and for \r\nreducing such tensions. \r\n At the same time, whatever we do remains \r\nsubject to the aforementioned Dutch clause: our \r\ninternational human rights system provides the \r\numbrella under which dialogue becomes possible, and \r\nit provides the firm and fertile soil upon we can build \r\nand grow. \r\n As the Prime Minister of the Netherlands stated \r\nin his address to the General Assembly last week (see \r\nA/62/PV.8), values connect us across our cultures and \r\nreligions. We must not allow cultural or religious \r\ndifferences to create barriers to open dialogue. The \r\nNetherlands wants to join forces with all those who \r\nwant to promote tolerance and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. But we must not allow such dialogue to \r\ncall into question the universal validity of our common \r\nvalues.  \r\n Against that background, the Netherlands \r\nGovernment has supported and will continue to support \r\na wide range of initiatives. In 2006, we contributed to \r\nthe celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \r\n1981 United Nations Declaration, held in Prague. On \r\nthat occasion, all participants underlined the \r\nimportance of that instrument as a basis for further \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue. In June 2008, \r\nthe Asia-Europe Meeting Interfaith Dialogue will be \r\nheld in Amsterdam. That meeting, which the \r\nNetherlands organizes together with Thailand, will not \r\nbe confined to discussions among participants. Our \r\ncapital city, Amsterdam, is actively involved, and \r\nparticipants will be invited to visit a number of grass-\r\nroots activities in Amsterdam, which is, as members \r\nmay be aware, home to 177 nationalities and to citizens \r\nwho are from a wide variety of ethnic and religious \r\nbackgrounds. \r\n That reflects a second principle, which we \r\ncherish when we speak about dialogue. Events — such \r\nas today’s — that bring together representatives of \r\nGovernments are, of course, important, but real \r\ndialogue can be successful only if it includes our \r\ncitizens. I am therefore very pleased at the presence, \r\ntoday and yesterday, of so many representatives of civil \r\nsociety and at the opportunity to interact with them \r\nduring the panel discussions. Non-governmental \r\norganizations have a key role to play in developing \r\ngrass-roots activities. With that in mind, the \r\nNetherlands is considering supporting the idea of the \r\nestablishment of a clearinghouse by Mr. Jorge \r\nSampaio, High Representative for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, so that we can learn from both the \r\nsuccesses and the caveats relating to dialogue activities \r\nat the local, national, regional and international levels. \r\n Finally, religious leaders bear a major \r\nresponsibility in this area, especially when it comes to \r\ninterreligious dialogue. They can provide the right \r\nexample: without denying the principles of their own \r\nfaith, they can make it clear that one should also have \r\nrespect for other religions and for those who choose \r\nnot to adhere to any religion or to change their religion. \r\nOf course, every religion, almost by definition, claims \r\nto represent the truth. That can lead to the exclusion of \r\nothers who believe in another truth. The more contacts \r\ntake place among religious leaders and their followers, \r\nthe more we will learn about the backgrounds of \r\nvarious religions and the easier it will become to truly \r\nunderstand and respect one another.  \r\n On 10 December 2008, on the occasion of the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the city of The Hague, in \r\ncooperation with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will \r\norganize a conference with many religious leaders from \r\nall over the world. We are hopeful that the leaders will, \r\non that occasion, reaffirm their commitment to human \r\nrights and to the promotion of mutual understanding \r\nand respect. \r\n The Netherlands will continue to remain actively \r\nengaged in initiatives aimed at reducing tensions \r\namong and within our respective societies. No country \r\ncan succeed on its own though, and I therefore hope \r\nthat this meeting will strengthen our joint efforts to \r\novercome our differences and make this global village \r\na place of peace and justice. \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 12 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Viktor Voronin, Deputy \r\nHead of the State Committee on Nationalities and \r\nReligions of Ukraine. \r\n Mr. Voronin (Ukraine) (spoke in Russian): \r\nUkraine has created the necessary legal basis for the \r\nfreedom of activity of religious organizations. Each \r\norganization is guaranteed the right to practice its \r\nreligion and conduct worship services. Parents have the \r\nright to raise their children in accordance with their \r\nreligious beliefs and in full privacy. The number of \r\nreligious organizations in Ukraine has nearly tripled \r\nover the past 15 years. Proof of this religious \r\nrenaissance is the fact that there are now \r\n406 functioning monasteries, a nearly seven-fold \r\nincrease, and more than 300 philanthropic missions are \r\nin operation. \r\n The establishment of a constitutional and legal \r\nbasis for freedom of belief and religion, along with the \r\nconstitutional guarantees for preserving and developing \r\ncultural, linguistic and religious identities, has helped \r\nto strengthen the religious infrastructure of ethnic and \r\nreligious minorities and has enriched their religious \r\nand spiritual life. Often divisions along national lines \r\nenter the religious sphere, and the religious needs of \r\nbelievers are met through services in their language in \r\naccordance with the religious traditions and customs of \r\nthose ethnic groups. Most religious organizations in \r\nUkraine reflect the characteristic spiritual, educational \r\nand religious needs of particular ethnic minorities. \r\nThere are about 1500 religious communities within the \r\nnational minorities, making up about 15 per cent of all \r\nreligious organizations. Despite the complexities and \r\ndiversity of religious life, Ukrainian society is \r\nconvinced of the need to affirm general standards of \r\nthe freedom of belief, as contained in international \r\ninstruments signed by Ukraine and reflected in our \r\ndomestic legislation.  \r\n Furthermore, social relations involving the \r\nfreedom of conscience are influenced by the laws and \r\nactivities of State authorities. Usually legal norms \r\nmerely reflect prevailing spiritual and moral traditions. \r\nGiven the multi-ethnicity and the many religions of \r\nUkraine, tolerance arises in social consciousness \r\nthrough a national dialogue with the participation of \r\nrepresentatives of government and of religious and \r\nsocial institutions. This country-wide religious \r\ndialogue is characterized by participation on many \r\nlevels and there is a free exchange of views, a \r\ncomparison of positions and an effort to resolve \r\nexisting problems. \r\n However, the form and content of the dialogue \r\nare not just limited to this, because they also provide \r\nfor an active relationship and practical and agreed \r\nactions on the part of the participants as they seek to \r\nreach mutual understanding and agreement. \r\nRepresentatives of the religious world in Ukraine are \r\nvery interested in establishing a dialogue with \r\nrepresentatives of other faiths and teachings and in \r\ntolerance in their relations with them. I are pleased to \r\nnote that this year in cooperation with \r\nnon-governmental organizations in Kiev the summit on \r\npeace and tolerance was successfully held, which \r\nincluded the spiritual leaders of Eastern Orthodoxy, \r\nIslam and Judaism. \r\n Although we speak of the creation of religious \r\npluralism in Ukraine as a fait accompli, it should be \r\nremembered that this pluralism underlies the \r\nconstructive interfaith relations and the unified \r\nmulti-religious space that have been established. \r\nReligious pluralism means not only the presence of a \r\nnumber of religions but also their legal equality. In that \r\ncontext, the Ukrainian Council of Churches and \r\nReligious Organizations has a great positive influence \r\non relations between the State and religious groups, \r\nstrengthening harmony and tolerance among religious \r\norganizations. \r\n The priorities of State policy in Ukraine \r\nregarding religion provide for a deepening of \r\nunderstanding between representatives of various \r\nfaiths, so as to eliminate prejudice and mistrust. \r\n Another priority area is the humanitarian sphere. \r\nThrough their interaction, religious organizations \r\ndevelop common positions on urgent contemporary \r\nproblems, in particular, problems involving \r\nglobalization, the environment, protection of human \r\nlife and the institution of the family.  \r\n Another priority area in State policy is to ensure \r\ninterethnic and interreligious harmony and ban the \r\nactivities of extremist organizations and the \r\ndissemination of their hateful views. Various measures \r\ncarried out by State authorities, together with the \r\nstrategy of cooperation between the State and religious \r\ninstitutions, will help to create an atmosphere of \r\nmutual respect and tolerance. \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n13 07-53003 \r\n \r\n Ukraine supports the principles of the separation \r\nof Church and State and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of religious groups and will continue to \r\nsupport in many ways the functioning of religious \r\norganizations and to carefully protect the rights of \r\nbelievers. We expect that this will lead to a \r\nstrengthening of peace and harmony and the spirit of \r\ntolerance and mutual respect in society.  \r\n Ukraine supports the efforts of the new President \r\nof the General Assembly to activate the dialogue on \r\nintercultural and interreligious understanding and on \r\ncooperation for peace. We not only are pleased to \r\nparticipate in this meeting and welcome this initiative, \r\nbut we are also ready to get actively involved in joint \r\nefforts at the United Nations and at the regional and \r\nsubregional levels, in particular in the Black Sea \r\nCooperation Organization. We are ready to do this \r\nthanks to the fact that we are one of the few countries \r\nin the post-Soviet area that has been able to avoid open \r\nconflicts despite difficult interreligious and interethnic \r\nproblems. \r\n This entitles us to invite others to follow our \r\nexample and work for understanding and tolerance and \r\nrespect for religious freedoms and cultural diversity, \r\nboth within our country as well as at the regional and \r\nsubregional levels. We can assure you that the United \r\nNations and its leadership can continue to count on \r\nUkraine to promote interreligious and interethnic \r\ntolerance in the future. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on Her Excellency Ms. Byrganym Aitimova, \r\nChairperson of the delegation of Kazakhstan. \r\n Ms. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): First of all, I would \r\nlike to congratulate you on your election to this high \r\noffice and express confidence that under your skilful \r\nstewardship the sixty-second session of the United \r\nNations General Assembly will be fruitful and \r\nsuccessful. \r\n The emergence of new challenges and threats to \r\nhumankind, particularly the rise of international \r\nterrorism and religious extremism, often fed by \r\ninterfaith tensions and hidden under the principles of \r\nreligions, makes the need for religious education, \r\ntolerance and mutual understanding and respect of \r\nvarious cultures and civilizations even more urgent. \r\nSeeking an accord between religions and the peaceful \r\ncoexistence of ethnic groups is a crucially important \r\nelement of the process of maintaining global security. \r\n Therefore, we attach great importance to this \r\nhigh-level dialogue and its informal interactive \r\nmeeting with civil society, which seek to further \r\ndevelop the outcomes of the key conferences and \r\ninitiatives on the theme of dialogue among cultures and \r\nreligions. We consider them all to be mutually \r\ninclusive, reinforcing and interrelated. \r\n Kazakhstan acclaims the significant work of the \r\nUnited Nations system and its agencies in addressing \r\nchallenges and seeking ways forward so as to find \r\npolicies, structures and programmes that can foster a \r\nculture of peace. We welcome the outcomes of the \r\ninformal thematic debate in the General Assembly on \r\ncivilizations and the challenge for peace, which was \r\nheld in May 2007 and produced a number of \r\nrecommendations. \r\n As a member of the Group of Friends of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, Kazakhstan commends the \r\nvaluable contribution of the Alliance and expresses its \r\nfull support for the report of the High-level Group and \r\nthe implementation plan based on it for 2007-2009, \r\nwhich is a guiding document with concrete proposals \r\nfor the establishment of a network of relations among \r\nthe various civilizations through activities in the areas \r\nof youth, education, media and migration. \r\n We strongly believe that the culture of peace \r\nstarts within us when we learn how to respect the \r\ninherent value and dignity of other cultures and \r\nreligions and when we allow them to keep up their \r\ntraditions. The moral standing of any society is judged \r\nby how it treats other nations and other peoples’ \r\ncultures. Intolerance and conflict can be prevented \r\nthrough tireless efforts in day-to-day activities and by \r\ntaking timely and concrete action at the local, national, \r\nregional and international levels. \r\n Kazakhstan is home to 130 ethnic groups and \r\n45 religious confessions and has set an example of \r\ntolerance which has become a decisive factor in the \r\nefforts to ensure peace, stability and the economic \r\nprogress of our country. Since we gained our \r\nindependence there have been no religious or \r\ninter-ethnic wars or conflicts on the territory of \r\nKazakhstan. This is due to our State policies and \r\ngeographical and historical background. \r\n Kazakhstan is at the crossroads of Islamic, \r\nChristian and Buddhist cultures. Historically, religious \r\ndiversity came to us along the Great Silk Road. The \r\nconstitution of our country today provides the society \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 14 \r\n \r\nwith the right to freedom of faith and expression, and \r\nthe State encourages people to advocate and adhere to \r\ntheir own cultures and religions. We have integrated \r\nthe history of religions and the promotion of tolerance \r\ninto our school curricula. \r\n Conscious of the critical importance of a dialogue \r\nbetween world religious confessions on key issues of \r\nthe modern order, Kazakhstan hosted the Second \r\nCongress of Leaders of World and Traditional \r\nReligions in 2006, the text of whose outcome \r\ndocument — the Declaration of the participants of the \r\nCongress — was circulated as a document of the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council and General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Among other provisions, representatives of \r\npractically all traditional and world religions called \r\nupon the global community, international and regional \r\norganizations, States and Governments to work to \r\nestablish a more just world, to consolidate international \r\nlaw and justice and to implement United Nations \r\nresolutions and signed international agreements. In \r\naddition, the Declaration called upon the world \r\ncommunity to take concrete collective measures to \r\nencourage and highlight positive perceptions of \r\ninterreligious relations by organizing joint meetings, \r\nseminars and addresses in the mass media, the Internet \r\nand other places of influence; by strongly promoting \r\ninterreligious tolerance among younger generations to \r\nmake them more devoted to dialogue and to encourage \r\nthem to recognize universal values and integrate \r\nquestions of dialogue between civilizations and \r\nreligions into curricula at all educational levels, with a \r\nview to helping young people learn to respect and \r\nunderstand religious and cultural differences without \r\nhostility. \r\n The Congress has become the vehicle for \r\nKazakhstan’s contribution to global dialogue among \r\nreligions. I would like to reiterate the initiative which \r\nthe President of Kazakhstan announced in his \r\nstatement in the General Assembly general debate last \r\nweek (see A/62/PV.4): to hold the Third Congress of \r\nthe Leaders of World and Traditional Religions in \r\n2009 under the auspices of the United Nations. We \r\nexpress our hope that we can count on the full support \r\nof the Member States of the United Nations for the \r\nimplementation of other initiatives of Kazakhstan, \r\nincluding the proposed declaration of one of the \r\ncoming years as the Year of Dialogue among Religions \r\nand Cultures, as stated in General Assembly resolution \r\n61/221, and the planned convening of an international \r\nforum entitled “Muslim world — West” at the end of \r\n2008 in Kazakhstan at the level of Ministers for \r\nForeign Affairs. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to state that there are \r\nno problems in the world that cannot be solved if we \r\nset harmony, tolerance and spirituality against \r\nanimosity, and if we base our relationships on mutual \r\ntrust and cooperation. Let us work together to take \r\nconcrete measures to identify causes of friction and \r\nreduce disagreements between nations, cultures and \r\nreligions. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Heraldo Muñoz, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the Republic of Chile. \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof Chile, I would like to express my thanks for the \r\nconvening of this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace. This initiative can assist us in \r\ndealing with one of the most complex challenges faced \r\nby the international community as a whole: promoting \r\nrespect and understanding among different religions, \r\ncreeds and cultures. \r\n This is a challenge which requires intense \r\ninternational cooperation. In that connection, various \r\ninitiatives have been put forward which recognize the \r\nequal dignity of all cultures. Among them is the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and its efforts to counteract \r\nthe rise of terrorism and polarization through an \r\nimplementation plan focusing on education, the media \r\nand youth and migration and whose goal is to help \r\novercome the division between Islam and the West. \r\nThe two initiatives converge in their respective spheres \r\nand can mutually strengthen each other with the \r\nnecessary coordination. \r\n As noted in the report of the Secretary-General \r\nentitled, “Interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace” (A/62/337), \r\nUNESCO has underscored the importance of \r\nintercultural dialogue for social cohesion, \r\nreconciliation and peace and has recognized dialogue \r\nas a means of advancing women’s human rights.  \r\n My country supports the recommendation of the \r\nSecretary-General to declare an International Year of \r\nDialogue among Religions and Cultures. \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n15 07-53003 \r\n \r\n The issue of peaceful coexistence among cultures \r\nand religions is not foreign to my country’s historical \r\nexperience. Indeed, Chile is and has been a land of \r\nrefuge from political and religious persecution. A \r\nstanza in our national anthem alludes to that tradition \r\nof refuge, saying that Chile is the country of “asylum \r\nfrom oppression”. The welcoming of foreigners is, \r\ntherefore, one of our nation’s most deeply rooted \r\ntraditions. \r\n Our country is home to the largest Palestinian \r\ncommunity in the world outside the Middle East. It \r\ncoexists in harmony with the Jewish community, \r\nsetting an encouraging example. Various cultural \r\ntraditions coexist peacefully in Chile against the \r\nbackdrop of full and equal respect for religious \r\nfreedom and fundamental freedoms. Churches of \r\nvarious denominations as well as mosques and \r\nsynagogues operate freely in the country. The same is \r\ntrue in the area of education. The separation of church \r\nand State is the guiding principle of our democratic \r\ninstitutions. \r\n The multilateral cultural policy of the \r\nGovernment of President Michelle Bachelet has \r\ndeveloped from two basic principles: respect for and \r\nsetting value on diversity and identity as fundamental \r\nprerequisites for positive globalization, and, secondly, \r\nthe protection, preservation and dissemination of \r\ncultural heritage.  \r\n Both governmental institutions and individuals \r\nmust ensure that the media and educational \r\nprogrammes eradicate preconceived and exclusionary \r\nideas. In Chilean schools, we have implemented a \r\nschool coexistence policy, whose goal is for our sons \r\nand daughters to learn to live together by developing \r\nthe skills, attitudes, values and knowledge necessary \r\nfor their civic education and to enable them to have \r\nrespect for diversity. \r\n Chile promotes a vision of society and the world \r\nin which culture, respect for diversity and tolerance are \r\nprerequisites for ensuring the prevalence of respect for \r\nhuman rights, democracy and development, as well as \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n Within the framework of the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, \r\nChile has promoted respect for various cultures and \r\nforms of artistic expression in the quest for a better \r\nunderstanding of universal values. In keeping with that \r\npolitical definition, Chile supported the adoption of the \r\nConvention on the Protection and Promotion of the \r\nDiversity of Cultural Expressions. Likewise, at the \r\nUnited Nations, Chile voted in favour of the recent \r\nadoption of the Declaration on the Rights of \r\nIndigenous Peoples. \r\n All religions and cultures deserve full respect. \r\nUndoubtedly, this is an area in which caution and \r\nmoderation must be exercised. We recognize that \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue makes a \r\ncontribution to peace and harmony, but we believe that \r\nthat cannot happen at the expense of freedom of \r\nexpression. \r\n Dialogue among religions and cultures should \r\nexplore the link to the issue of democracy. Democracy \r\nguarantees respect for diversity, tolerance and the \r\nrights of all. In addition, evidence shows that conflicts \r\nand wars do not generally occur between democracies. \r\n Finally, the contribution that my country can \r\noffer today in this forum is to turn our gaze towards a \r\nvirtue that is characteristic of political coexistence and \r\nis present in democratic societies. I am referring to the \r\nconcept of civic friendship, the respectful relationship \r\nthat exists in politics — even between adversaries — \r\nwhich places the intrinsic value of a relationship and of \r\nmutual appreciation above differences or antagonisms. \r\nIt is such civic friendship, based on mutual respect, \r\nthat we believe should preside over the relations \r\namong religions and cultures. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Christian Wenaweser, head \r\nof the delegation of Liechtenstein.  \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Particularly \r\nsince the events of 11 September 2001 there has been a \r\ngrowing concern about cross-cultural and interreligious \r\ntensions. Some have seen the world inevitably veering \r\ntowards a clash of civilizations — a confrontation of \r\nmonolithic, self-contained blocs. In discussing the \r\nchallenges and opportunities related to intercultural \r\nand interreligious dialogue, we must reject a static \r\nconcept of culture and civilization, as well as the \r\nnotion that cultures are entities that need to be \r\nprotected against anything foreign. A culture or \r\ncivilization constantly evolves over time, adapts to new \r\nconditions and settings and is formed in interaction \r\nwith other cultures and identities. \r\n Embracing a dynamic concept of culture and \r\nidentity is therefore a precondition for a meaningful \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 16 \r\n \r\ndialogue among civilizations and religions. It requires \r\na willingness to learn and accept that one’s own way of \r\nlooking at and doing things is neither the only way nor, \r\nnecessarily, the best way. Arrogance has no place in \r\ndialogue. In addition, dialogue among civilizations \r\nmust not be distorted by differences in power: it has to \r\nbe inclusive, and all participants have to be treated \r\nequally. We should take seriously the concern that there \r\nis a trend towards the predominance of one culture \r\nover the others, brought about by globalization and the \r\npresent power structure. \r\n Diversity yields many opportunities, but it may \r\nbe regarded as a threat, because it challenges the ways \r\nof life to which we are accustomed and disturbs the \r\ncomfort that human beings find in stability and the \r\npreservation of the status quo. \r\n Owing to globalization, differences among \r\ncultures and religions have become starker, as modern \r\ncommunication technologies and fast, affordable forms \r\nof transport have led to a world where people of \r\ndifferent backgrounds have the daily opportunity and \r\nneed to interact. Under those circumstances, if we want \r\nto create a foundation for cooperation for peace \r\nthrough the fostering of intercultural and interreligious \r\nunderstanding, we will have to find ways to address \r\npeople’s fears and concerns regarding cultural and \r\nreligious diversity. Education has to play a vital role in \r\nthat respect. \r\n Another key element is providing forums for \r\ndialogue, since one of the best ways to reduce \r\nprejudice is for people to get to know and understand \r\none another. Access to the media and to information \r\ntechnology is crucial for that purpose. Bridging the \r\ndigital divide is thus an important prerequisite for \r\nadvancing intercultural and interreligious \r\nunderstanding. \r\n Migration often leads to the transformation of \r\nrelatively uniform communities and societies into \r\nmulticultural ones and thereby gives rise to new \r\nchallenges to social coherence and peace. \r\nLiechtenstein, for example, has experienced a \r\ntremendous influx of immigrants since the end of the \r\nSecond World War — an influx that has been fuelled \r\nmainly by its economic success. With the number of \r\nforeigners in our country at 33.9 per cent, the \r\nGovernment and inhabitants of Liechtenstein are \r\nconfronted with the challenge of interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding on a regular basis. \r\n The Government has taken a series of measures \r\nto promote the integration of migrants, to fight \r\nxenophobia and racism and to enhance understanding \r\namong various cultural and religious groups. One focus \r\nof the Government’s policy is on the provision of \r\ntargeted services aimed at enabling migrants to learn \r\nthe national language. This helps to fulfil one of the \r\nbasic preconditions for dialogue and socio-economic \r\nintegration.  \r\n Another main concern is the institutionalization \r\nof dialogue among all cultural and religious groups in \r\nthe country. Liechtenstein’s Prime Minister has \r\ntherefore, held several round-table meetings with \r\nmigrants’ associations. As a follow-up, a networking \r\nplatform for migrants’ associations and organizations \r\nactive in the field of integration and intercultural \r\ndialogue has been set up. \r\n As important as measures at the national level \r\nmay be, the United Nations and other international \r\norganizations, such as the Council of Europe, are \r\ncertainly appropriate forums for establishing an overall \r\ndialogue among civilizations and for fostering \r\nintercultural and interreligious understanding. Let us \r\njoin our efforts within those frameworks and develop a \r\ncommon answer to terrorism, intolerance and racism. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Giancarlo Soler, head of the \r\ndelegation of Panama. \r\n Mr. Soler Torrijos (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for convening this meeting.  \r\n This year, important international conferences \r\nhave strengthened the existing consensus about the \r\nfundamental principles of understanding between \r\ncultures and religions, and their value for peaceful \r\ncooperation. We are very glad to acknowledge that \r\nfact, even though we lack what is needed to achieve the \r\nsocial implementation of that consensus on a global \r\nscale and to make the results that we seek a reality. \r\n The completion of that task requires persistent \r\neffort and support at many levels, and this is beyond \r\nthe capacity of Governments. The effective \r\nimplementation of that consensus requires a broad \r\nmobilization of the citizenry, something that social \r\norganizations have the ability to muster, with the \r\nplurality of their perspectives and ranges of action. \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n17 07-53003 \r\n \r\n Of course, promoting tolerance and \r\nunderstanding between cultures and religions is \r\nessential to harmonizing relations between nations and \r\nsocial groups. Nevertheless, it is not enough to ensure \r\nthe presence or maintenance of such tolerance. Fruitful \r\ncoexistence between people of different cultures and \r\nbeliefs is strengthened only when expectations and \r\nprojects are shared and when the people believe that \r\nthey can achieve those ends through common efforts. \r\n Although cultural and religious disagreements \r\nand encounters have their own dynamic, we must \r\nexamine them together with other factors. As \r\npreviously stated, rival economic, environmental and \r\nterritorial interests tend to give rise to tensions that can \r\nthen be manipulated and exacerbated in the ethnic, \r\ncultural and religious arenas. The problem is far more \r\ncomplex when foreign interests are involved. That is \r\nwhy avoiding those interferences and ensuring and \r\nencouraging cooperation and synergy to foster a \r\nmutually beneficial undertaking will help to bridge the \r\ngap between parties. \r\n The recent declaration recognizing the cultural \r\nand religious rights of indigenous peoples was a further \r\nstep in the right direction. In order to promote a more \r\nbalanced dynamic between the different ethno-cultural \r\nactors in a country, it is essential to recognize and \r\nvalue the cultural legacy of the native peoples who, \r\ntogether with the immigrant and Creole populations, \r\nenrich and shape the identity of the cultural \r\nconglomerate of each nation. Moreover, that \r\nrecognition is valuable in easing the plight of those \r\nwho struggle to satisfy other human development \r\nneeds, such as citizenship, justice and equality of \r\nopportunity, which are all elements that mitigate the \r\ndifferences with other social groups. \r\n It is only natural that, after centuries of \r\nmarginalization, many native peoples should make \r\nimpassioned demands for the recognition of their \r\nculture and beliefs. But this has sometimes kindled \r\nresentment and promoted confrontation that damage \r\nthe socioeconomic integrity and governability of multi-\r\nethnic States. In extreme cases, this leads to civil strife, \r\nwhich does nothing to improve the material and \r\nspiritual well-being of affected peoples. \r\n To avoid such a scenario, we must ensure that \r\nthis recognition can be assumed by everyone, not as a \r\nway of exalting our inequities, but as an opportune \r\noccasion for coexistence, exchange and an \r\nunderstanding of our differences as opportunities for \r\ncomplementarity in shared projects. \r\n The option of building cooperation-oriented \r\nrelationships requires us to highlight the many things \r\ncultures and religions have in common, as different \r\nways of sustaining similar or compatible moral and \r\nhumanitarian aspirations. However, in order for that \r\neffort to stress what we have in common — or not to \r\nstress our differences — we need continuous support \r\nfrom educational systems and the media. \r\n The State has certain responsibilities with regard \r\nto the school system, but the media can also contribute \r\nconstructively in that area. However, with regard to the \r\nmedia, we are generally dealing with private \r\nenterprises that frequently invoke their freedom of \r\nexpression and may be reluctant to follow government \r\nguidelines. In such cases, social organizations can play \r\nan explanatory and critical role in the effort to \r\neradicate all expressions of racism, xenophobia, \r\nintolerance and cultural exclusion. \r\n No one will achieve these objectives on their \r\nown. International organizations, Governments and \r\nsocial organizations must all complement each other, \r\ntogether with cultural and religious organizations, in \r\norder for peace to become an inclusive and lasting \r\nreality. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call \r\nnext on His Excellency Mr. Steve Dick Tenyson \r\nMantenje, Chairman of the delegation of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Mantenje (Malawi): Allow me to begin by \r\ncongratulating the President of the Assembly, for \r\nconvening this important High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Cooperation and \r\nUnderstanding for Peace. We commend the Philippines \r\nand Pakistan for all their efforts and their pivotal role \r\nin making this meeting a reality. \r\n The theme of the Dialogue, which is \r\n“interreligious and intercultural cooperation for the \r\npromotion of tolerance, understanding and universal \r\nrespect on matters of freedom of religion or belief and \r\ncultural diversity”, has merit and is worthy of the time \r\nreserved for this High-level Dialogue. \r\n Malawi attaches great importance to respect for \r\nreligious and cultural diversity, particularly in the \r\nincreasingly globalizing world we live in. We believe \r\nthat respect for religious and cultural diversity can \r\ncontribute to international cooperation, peace and \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 18 \r\n \r\nsecurity and promote enhanced dialogue among \r\nnations. We therefore call upon the international \r\ncommunity to create an environment that is conducive \r\nto the exchange of human experience with a view to \r\ncombating violence, intimidation, hatred and \r\nintolerance based on cultural and religious differences, \r\nwhich in turn causes disunity among societies. \r\n The founders of the United Nations envisioned a \r\njust and harmonious world when they established our \r\nOrganization. We cannot achieve such a world through \r\nlegal, political or military means alone, as we have \r\nattempted to during the 62 years of the existence of the \r\nUnited Nations. The contribution of our faiths and \r\ncultures is also required to facilitate a more just and \r\nharmonious world. Malawi therefore believes that the \r\nfounders of the United Nations expected that the best \r\nparts of our diverse cultures — our religions \r\nstrengths — would be a tremendous asset in achieving \r\nthe noble objectives of the United Nations Charter. \r\n Indeed, in the 2005 World Summit Outcome, our \r\nleaders acknowledged the diversity of the world and \r\nthat all cultures and civilizations contribute to the \r\nenrichment of humankind. Accordingly, this Dialogue \r\nshould be seen as yet another opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to continue to explore ways \r\nand means of furthering the agenda of promoting \r\ninternational peace and security and encouraging \r\ntolerance among different cultures and religions of the \r\nworld, all of which are unique in their own respects. \r\n Allow me to underline some important \r\nconsiderations that must be taken into account as we \r\nmap out the way forward in promoting interreligious \r\nand intercultural understanding and cooperation for \r\npeace. First, we believe that there is a need to establish \r\neducation systems that promote respect for diversity; \r\nsecondly, the media at all levels must support and \r\nencourage dialogue in an ethical and responsible \r\nmanner; and thirdly, countries must promote the \r\neffective utilization of information technology in order \r\nto promote greater dialogue and understanding, \r\nespecially among young people. Malawi commends \r\nUNESCO for its contribution in that respect. \r\n At the national level, Malawi continues to be \r\ncommitted to the purposes and principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, with particular reference \r\nto the right to freedom of thought, conscience and \r\nreligion. In that regard, the Malawi Constitution \r\nguarantees various fundamental rights, including the \r\nright of every person to use the language — and \r\nparticipate in the cultural life — of his or her choice. It \r\nalso guarantees freedom of association, conscience, \r\nopinion and assembly and freedom of the press. In \r\naddition, it guarantees to all persons equal and \r\neffective protection against discrimination on the \r\ngrounds of race; colour; sex; language; religion; \r\npolitical or other opinion; national, ethnic or social \r\norigin; disability; property; birth; or other status. On \r\nthe basis of those constitutional provisions, the Malawi \r\nGovernment has progressively formulated policies and \r\nenacted laws aimed at creating an enabling \r\nenvironment for the promotion of understanding, \r\ntolerance and friendship among the people of Malawi, \r\nirrespective of their cultural or religious diversity or \r\nlanguage. Further, Malawi is a party to the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \r\n While challenges in bringing about complete \r\ninterreligious and cultural harmony still exist, all \r\nreligions and cultural sectors in Malawi are committed \r\nto peaceful coexistence. That is what has made Malawi \r\na relatively peaceful country since its independence, in \r\n1964. \r\n In conclusion, Malawi supports the \r\nrecommendation, contained in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, that the General Assembly should declare a \r\nYear of Dialogue among Religions and Cultures. We \r\nshare the belief that a peaceful world can be assured \r\nonly through mutual understanding and interreligious \r\nand cultural dialogue. We also support the proposal \r\nthat a focal unit be established within the Secretariat to \r\nfollow up on interreligious and cultural issues. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Basilio Antonio Gutiérrez \r\nGarcía, Chairman of the delegation of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez García (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nToday, more than ever before, it is essential to reaffirm \r\nthe importance of full respect for the political, \r\neconomic, cultural, social and religious diversity of \r\nevery nation, in strict conformity with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.  \r\n In a world characterized by neoliberal \r\nglobalization, corporatization and privileged \r\nconsumerism, global power elites impose on others \r\ntheir own cultural patterns as an instrument of their \r\nneocolonial policies. Although various initiatives have \r\nencouraged respect for cultural diversity and the \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n19 07-53003 \r\n \r\npromotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, \r\ntoday’s world bears witness to genocidal wars \r\npromoted by the Powers of the North in their voracious \r\npursuit of hegemonic dominance. \r\n Cuba views with great concern the escalation of \r\nthe grave human rights violations committed in the \r\nname of the so-called war on terror, particularly the \r\nmanifestations of hatred, xenophobia, religious \r\nintolerance and discrimination against national, ethnic \r\nand religious minorities, which are further exacerbated \r\nwhen the victims are of Arab origin or of the Muslim \r\nfaith.  \r\n The practice in the Western media of projecting a \r\nnegative image of Islam and the attempt to identify \r\nsome cultures with terrorism and violence have \r\nheightened the ongoing threat to the full enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms by persons \r\naffiliated with that faith. Compounding the situation is \r\nthe rise in racist, discriminatory and xenophobic views \r\nconcerning the superiority of races, cultures and \r\nnations — views that have been among the main causes \r\nof distressing conflicts throughout history. It is our \r\nduty to prevent a repetition of such conflicts.  \r\n Given that worrisome reality, it is imperative that \r\nwe preserve the human race, safeguard the identity of \r\nevery people and promote a culture of peace based on \r\nmutual respect and peaceful coexistence among \r\nnations. An important step forward in the attainment of \r\nthose objectives was the entry into force, on 18 March \r\n2007, of the Convention on the Protection and \r\nPromotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, \r\nadopted by 148 countries, which is a milestone in our \r\njoint struggle to preserve the important human right to \r\ndiversity. \r\n Recently, during the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nMinisterial Meeting on Human Rights and Cultural \r\nDiversity, held in Iran, the members of the Movement, \r\nincluding Cuba, endorsed the adoption of the Tehran \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, which sets out a \r\nseries of actions aimed at defending cultural diversity. \r\nLikewise, we hope that the international review \r\nconference on the implementation of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action will be an \r\nimportant opportunity to discuss this issue within the \r\nframework of the global fight against racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  \r\n Today, more than ever before, we must reaffirm \r\nthe right of peoples to self-determination, whereby \r\nthey freely determine their own political status and \r\npursue their economic, social and cultural \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Let us work to create a democratic and equitable \r\ninternational order, based on dialogue, cooperation and \r\ncultural exchange, that prevents cultural \r\nhomogenization and the domination of peoples.  \r\n Let us promote dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations and vigorously oppose the pretext of the \r\nso-called clash of civilizations, which is used by those \r\nwho threaten the peace and security of our peoples.  \r\n Let us promote international solidarity, without \r\nconditions, to promote genuine development of the \r\ncountries of the South while sharing a common \r\nheritage of universal values that are opposed to any \r\nirrational hatred among the world’s human beings.  \r\n Let us work to realize the right to education, \r\naccording particular importance to education based on \r\na spirit of tolerance and friendship among all human \r\nbeings, whereby religious diversity, international \r\nunderstanding and peace are respected in a world with \r\nequal social justice for all. \r\n Let us utilize communication technologies, \r\nincluding the Internet, to disseminate a message of \r\nconstructive dialogue and understanding among diverse \r\ncultures and civilizations. \r\n Let us work to establish cultural policies that \r\ndefend our national identities and protect our heritage \r\nwhile promoting mutual enrichment among nations. \r\n Let us advocate the globalization of diversity. Let \r\nus demand respect for the rights of minorities, the \r\nexcluded and the marginalized. By defending \r\nunderstanding among cultures and religions today, we \r\nare defending our right to preserve the future of \r\nhumanity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Dato’ Kamilan \r\nMaksom, Chairman of the delegation of Malaysia.  \r\n Mr. Maksom (Malaysia): I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to express to the President of the General \r\nAssembly our appreciation for convening this High-\r\nLevel Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace. I also take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the delegations of the \r\nPhilippines and Pakistan for initiating this dialogue. \r\nWe see this as a timely effort at bringing our various \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 20 \r\n \r\ncultures religions and peoples together to engage in \r\ndialogue amongst ourselves under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n Malaysia is fully supportive of efforts at the \r\ninternational level which are designed to generate \r\ngreater understanding between religions, cultures and \r\ncivilizations. In fact, we have been involved in efforts \r\nto build bridges among religions, cultures and \r\ncivilizations, including organizing an international \r\ninterfaith dialogue entitled, “Who speaks for Islam? \r\nWho speaks for the West?”, which was held in Kuala \r\nLumpur in 2006 and 2007. Additionally, along with \r\nCyprus, Malaysia co-hosted the second annual Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting Interfaith Dialogue, held in July 2006. \r\nMalaysia was also one of the sponsors of the \r\nConference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace, which \r\nwas held on 22 June 2005. We are pleased to note the \r\nparticipation of the civil society and including \r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector \r\nat those dialogues, which we believe will clearly \r\nenhance our mutual efforts towards promoting \r\nintercultural, intercivilizational and interreligious \r\nunderstanding. That larger participation also represents \r\nthe determined will of the international community to \r\ncooperate for peace. Indeed, for this sort of dialogue to \r\nbe successful, the widest range of partners and \r\nstakeholders needs to be involved. \r\n Our world continues to be besieged with conflicts \r\namong nations and among peoples, despite our \r\nprogress into modernity and democracy. Cultural and \r\nreligious differences are said to be the causes of our \r\npresent-day conflicts; yet we know very well that they \r\nare spawned by differences in our particular \r\nviewpoints. When we should be celebrating the beauty \r\nof diversity among peoples, some, including zealots, \r\ndistract from this and instead highlight cultural and \r\nreligious differences and transforming those \r\ndifferences into divisions. Moreover, self-centric \r\nsocieties which view other peoples and cultures from \r\nthe perspective of their own benchmarks and \r\nphilosophies while imposing their values onto other \r\nsocieties, contribute to the atmosphere of acrimony and \r\ndistrust among peoples.  \r\n Just as religion is taken to extremes, so too is the \r\nnotion of democracy, including freedom of speech and \r\nexpression, which on many occasions is taken to \r\nextremes, ignoring the sensitivities and feelings of \r\ncertain groups of people. The oppression and \r\nill-treatment of certain groups of people by States and, \r\nin some cases, by people of different persuasions, as in \r\nthe case of Palestinian people and Muslim minorities in \r\ncertain parts of the world, also contribute to the \r\ngrowing among between cultures and religions, \r\nparticularly between the Western world and Islam.  \r\n This dangerous trend of a growing schism among \r\ndifferent cultures and religions must be addressed \r\nimmediately lest it present a serious threat to \r\ninternational peace. We need to bridge this gap and \r\nnarrow down any differences we have. As a multi-\r\nethnic, multicultural and multireligious country which \r\ncelebrated 50 years of nationhood of this year, \r\nMalaysia understands very well the challenges the \r\nworld will be confronted with if this dangerous trend is \r\nnot reversed. \r\n Malaysia believes that the key to bringing all of \r\nus closer and to narrowing this gap is to build a culture \r\nof respect. Respect for one another will propagate \r\nunderstanding and tolerance; tolerance of our rich \r\ndiversity will create the understanding needed for us to \r\nbridge the gap among our cultures and civilizations.  \r\n Malaysia views its role today as part of an \r\nintercultural, intercivilizational and interreligious \r\ndialogue, where all parties need to ensure that we \r\nmultiply the bridge-builders and focus on the common \r\nvalues that we share. We need to approach dialogue \r\nwith mutual respect from all dimensions including \r\nethnicity, culture and religion, as well as with mutual \r\nrespect for different cultures and nationalities. Political \r\nviewpoints should not cloud our common values.  \r\n While we work towards fostering dialogue in this \r\nhigh-level forum, of equal if not greater importance is \r\nthe need to focus on our subsequent work on ensuring \r\nthat that our interactions at this Dialogue and all other \r\ndialogues of this nature flow to the people at the grass-\r\nroots level. Our dialogue should be people-centred and \r\npeople-oriented, rather then State-centric. Our dialogue \r\nis too often crouched in political or academic language \r\nand terms which become too vague or convoluted. We \r\ntherefore need to translate our ideas and thoughts into \r\npractical measures and ways for the masses to \r\nunderstand and appreciate.  \r\n One way is through education. We believe that \r\neducation is an essential tool towards developing \r\ngreater understanding and stemming the rising tide of \r\nintolerance and distrust. Our youth should be guided \r\ninto understanding the beauty of our diversity as \r\nopposed to its contradictions. The sense of \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n21 07-53003 \r\n \r\nunderstanding, tolerance, sensitivity and awareness of \r\nother cultures and persuasions must be instilled and \r\nfostered in each layer of the society, particularly young \r\npeople. An intermixing of young minds and ideas \r\nthrough unbiased and responsible guidance would \r\npromote a culture of respect, tolerance and \r\nunderstanding. Malaysia is convinced that, through the \r\nestablishment of more youth cooperation programmes, \r\nunderstanding and the appreciation of the values and \r\nbeliefs systems of others will be forged. \r\n Malaysia recognizes the important role of the \r\nmedia in promoting in interfaith and intrafaith \r\ndialogue. Unfortunately, we note that most \r\ninternational media tend to highlight the differences \r\nrather than the commonalities among other cultures \r\nand religions. We see the labelling of certain groups of \r\npeople as counterproductive with respect to building \r\nunderstanding and trust among peoples. This creates \r\nconfusion rather than clarity.  \r\n Labelling furthermore has the potential to be self-\r\nprophesizing, since no one specific word can perfectly \r\ncapture a particular human phenomenon. It is therefore \r\nimportant to use words and language which create \r\nconfidence and take into account the sensitivities of \r\nothers, in order to create a culture of respect, \r\nunderstanding and tolerance.  \r\n At the same time, the international media must \r\nalso give sufficient space to voices that speak of \r\nharmony, tolerance and moderation. The voices of \r\nfacilitators and communicators who build bridges of \r\ngoodwill among cultures and religions must be \r\nhighlighted to muffle voices of those who preach \r\nextremism and hatred. \r\n Malaysia remains committed to efforts, \r\nparticularly through the United Nations, towards \r\ngenerating respect, understanding and tolerance among \r\ncultures, religions and civilizations. We believe that \r\npositive interaction among peoples of diverse cultures \r\nand values will help to achieve the aim of preserving \r\nand promoting global peace, stability and harmony. We \r\nare convinced that the culture of peace lies with mutual \r\nrespect, understanding and tolerance among religions, \r\ncultures and peoples. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Rosemary Banks, \r\nChairperson of the delegation of New Zealand. \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): New Zealand Prime \r\nMinister Helen Clark said this year that “We do not \r\naccept that there is anything inevitable or unavoidable \r\nabout tension and conflict between ethnicities, cultures \r\nand faiths”. New Zealand considers that tensions \r\narising from ignorance, unfamiliarity and a lack of \r\nunderstanding can be mitigated by dialogue, by \r\neducation and by a willingness to learn from and be \r\ntolerant of others. That view is encapsulated in General \r\nAssembly resolution 61/221 and underpins the holding \r\nof this important high-level dialogue, commendably \r\npromoted by the Philippines and Pakistan. It is \r\ncertainly a dialogue that New Zealand supports. \r\n New Zealand’s commitment to interfaith and \r\nintercultural dialogue is part of our wider response to \r\nhelping build a more secure and peaceful world. Our \r\ninvolvement in various initiatives, such as the United \r\nNations Alliance of Civilizations and the Asia-Pacific \r\nRegional Interfaith Dialogue, reinforces our wider \r\nregional and global counter-terrorism and \r\npeacekeeping efforts. \r\n In May 2007, New Zealand hosted two \r\nsignificant gatherings to advance the global response to \r\ninterfaith and intercultural issues in a practical way. \r\nFirst, for two days in May, our Prime Minister \r\npersonally hosted, in coordination with the \r\nGovernment of Norway, a high-level symposium on the \r\nreport of the High-level Group for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. As a friend of the Alliance and viewing \r\nthe Alliance as the most important initiative of its kind, \r\nNew Zealand wanted the High-level Group’s report to \r\nreceive serious consideration in our Asia-Pacific \r\nregion. \r\n The symposium succeeded in drawing out those \r\nrecommendations that have particular potential and \r\nrelevance for implementation in our region. \r\nParticipants canvassed regional approaches to cross-\r\ncultural education and curriculum development, \r\nincluding through contacts between Islamic studies \r\ncentres, broader youth exchanges and networks, a new \r\nprogramme of intercultural exchange in the region, \r\nmedia literacy, cross-cultural training for journalists, \r\nbetter engagement with media owners, development of \r\nhumane migration systems and better integration of \r\nmigrants into local communities. \r\n New Zealand will be working with regional \r\npartners and the Alliance of Civilizations secretariat to \r\npromote the symposium’s outcomes and the Alliance’s \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 22 \r\n \r\nimplementation plan within our region. As a first step, \r\nNew Zealand has recently contributed NZ $50,000 to \r\nthe Alliance’s trust fund, earmarked for projects in \r\nSouth-East Asia. \r\n We are pleased to see that the momentum of the \r\nAlliance continues to build in the lead-up to the first \r\nAlliance forum in Spain early next year, alongside a \r\nglobal youth forum. New Zealand looks forward to \r\nparticipating actively at those events. \r\n Secondly, later in May this year, New Zealand \r\nhosted the third Asia-Pacific Regional Interfaith \r\nDialogue, a process that is co-sponsored by Indonesia, \r\nAustralia and the Philippines. The Regional Interfaith \r\nDialogue brings together representatives of the major \r\nfaith and community groups of 15 countries in the \r\nSouth-East Asia region and adjacent South Pacific to \r\nexplore cooperation and communication and to build \r\nunderstanding and mutual respect among the adherents \r\nof our region’s different religious faiths. \r\n The Action Plan adopted from that meeting held \r\nin Waitangi sets out a range of proposals for practical \r\naction. Those include recommendations for improving \r\nnetworking and connections between and within faith \r\ncommunities; recommendations aimed at fostering \r\ntolerance and understanding of other religions in both \r\nthe public and religious education systems and also \r\nrecommendations to improve the quality and critical \r\nstance of the coverage of religious issues in the media. \r\n The inclusion of intra-faith discussions in the \r\nInterfaith Dialogue agenda was another key outcome \r\nfor New Zealand. We see intra-faith discussion as a \r\nmeans to build lasting networks, particularly amongst \r\nthe region’s Muslim communities, which could be a \r\nforce for moderation and pluralism. While our \r\nRegional Interfaith Dialogue is narrower than the inter-\r\ncivilizational focus of the Alliance, there are a number \r\nof useful synergies, and the two processes have — we \r\nthink — much to contribute to each other. Both \r\npromote diversity as a fundamental strength of human \r\nsociety. \r\n New Zealand’s effort is only a part of the \r\ngrowing national, regional and international efforts to \r\nbuild, as through this High-level Dialogue, \r\ninterreligious and intercultural understanding and \r\ncooperation for peace. We commend the important \r\nleadership that the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization continues to show \r\nin that area and welcome the contribution of the \r\nCommonwealth Commission on Respect and \r\nUnderstanding and the Asia-Europe Meeting’s \r\nInterfaith Dialogue, to name just a few of the many \r\nvaluable processes now underway. \r\n However, I have to underline the importance of \r\nensuring that our dialogue this week and the other \r\nvaluable ongoing processes are not simply to the \r\nintellectual benefit of those who have the privilege to \r\npartake in them. A key outcome from our Auckland \r\nsymposium was agreement that programmes put in \r\nplace as a result of those exchanges need to reach \r\nbeyond the elite and touch those sections of society \r\nthat will determine whether we can reach our shared \r\ngoal of building interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Park Hee-kwon, \r\nChairman of the delegation of the Republic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Park Hee-kwon (Republic of Korea): The \r\nnew circumstances we face today are manifested in a \r\nform of competition between integration and \r\nconfrontation. On the one hand, increasing economic \r\nintegration driven by modern technology is changing \r\nhuman relations by breaking down barriers of \r\ncommunication and distance. Globalization of that kind \r\nis now the defining trend of our world. On the other \r\nhand, that major trend is not necessarily ushering in a \r\nworld of peace and prosperity. \r\n Globalization shows evidence of both a bright \r\nand dark face simultaneously. The shortening of \r\ndistances removes mediating buffer zones between \r\npeoples of different backgrounds, which can trigger \r\ncultural and social tensions. As an illustration, \r\nglobalization has met with strong protest in some \r\nquarters. It is perceived by many as a means of \r\nimposing Western values in non-Western parts of the \r\nworld. In addition, rising extremism stands in the way \r\nof achieving respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms for all. That dark side, if left unattended, may \r\ngive rise to misunderstanding and mistrust among \r\ndifferent cultures. It is likely to undermine efforts \r\naimed at establishing peace and prosperity. \r\n First and foremost, I believe we must bear in \r\nmind that the common denominator of all cultures and \r\nreligions is a message of love and brotherhood. With \r\nthat ideal before us, the Republic of Korea welcomes \r\nthe recent adoption by the Member States of the United \r\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n23 07-53003 \r\n \r\nPeoples. My Government believes that the Declaration \r\nwill contribute to strengthening dialogue among \r\ncultures by promoting equality and non-discrimination \r\nfor all and especially for marginalized indigenous \r\npeoples. \r\n Let me turn to the root causes of intercultural \r\nmisunderstanding, namely, poverty, human rights \r\nviolations and a disregard for the danger of armed \r\nconflicts; the historical fault lines of race, religion and \r\ncultural traditions also encourage mutual distrust. In \r\norder to further our common goals of tolerance, mutual \r\nunderstanding and the observance of human rights, the \r\nUnited Nations must root out the potential causes of \r\nhostility. In that sense, revitalizing multilateralism is \r\ncritical to addressing our shared challenges. The \r\nUnited Nations is the best vehicle for that process. \r\n However, our efforts to avoid potential \r\nmisunderstandings have been slow, given the urgent \r\nneed for dialogue among cultures and civilizations. \r\nThat said, the United Nations system should be more \r\ninclusive and open to civil society. Dealing with this \r\nparticular challenge will be difficult, requiring \r\npartnerships between stakeholders. We must strengthen \r\ncooperation between all actors, including \r\nGovernments, international organizations and the \r\ninstitutions of civil society. An all-inclusive United \r\nNations system intent on alliance-building with distant \r\nbranches of the world community — and especially \r\nwith institutions in civil society such as religious \r\ngroups — can play a role in tracking and dissolving the \r\nessential causes of distrust. \r\n The good news is that initiatives in this direction, \r\nsuch as the Alliance of Civilizations, are beginning to \r\ntake hold. Indeed, we welcome initiatives such as the \r\nAlliance and support cooperation with the United \r\nNations system. \r\n Given the limited resources for our endeavours, \r\nwe must set priorities when implementing any such \r\ninitiatives. The report of the High-level Group for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations recommended that we focus \r\nattention on such issues as immigration, youth, politics \r\nand education. \r\n Furthermore, initiatives for dialogue among \r\ncivilizations should be planned and implemented in a \r\nway compatible with system-wide coherence in the \r\nUnited Nations system. This will not only avoid \r\nduplication, but also enhance the effectiveness of these \r\nendeavours. \r\n As part of my Government’s effort to encourage \r\ndialogue among world youth, the Republic of Korea is \r\nplanning to hold a youth forum alongside the second \r\nWorld Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth, \r\nto be held in 2009 and co-sponsored by the United \r\nNations. I hope the Conference will provide an \r\nopportunity for world youth to deepen their mutual \r\nunderstanding. \r\n We live in challenging times. With the advance of \r\nglobalization, economic integration can heighten \r\ncultural friction. Managing these stresses in such a way \r\nthat they do not slip out of control is a daunting task. \r\nMerely recognizing the need for and the merits of \r\ndialogue is not sufficient. Strong political will is \r\nrequired. The Republic of Korea believes that \r\npeacebuilding, the achievement of the Millennial \r\nDevelopment Goals and respect for human rights \r\nshould be the bedrock on which to forge a fair and \r\nmutual understanding among all the peoples of the \r\nworld. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Gilles Noghès, Chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Monaco. \r\n Mr. Noghès (Monaco) (spoke in French): \r\nDialogue between civilizations must be recognized as a \r\nfundamental principle with regard to establishing and \r\nmaintaining tolerant and peaceful relations between \r\npeople from different traditions, cultures or religions. \r\n It is surprising that it took 20 centuries of our \r\nconventional era before the importance of cultural \r\ndiversity was recognized. How is it conceivable that \r\npeople still sometimes set freedom and tolerance in \r\nopposition to each other? According to the 1789 \r\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, \r\nliberty consists in the freedom to do everything which \r\nthat no one else. Emmanuel Lévinas said, in a \r\nremarkable manner, that liberties, far from being in \r\nconflict, call out to each other and mutually awaken \r\neach other. In fact, the coexistence of liberties rests on \r\nthe principle of tolerance. \r\n We must recognize differences and respect them. \r\nAt the same time, we should know how to condemn \r\nviolence without drawing false parallels. Terrorism \r\nshould not in any way be allowed to lead to the \r\ninterruption of dialogue or to intolerance. When Jean-\r\nPaul Sartre says “Hell is other people”, he meant that \r\neach person is the torturer of the other, by constantly \r\nsubjecting them to judgment. We must leave this hell, \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 24 \r\n \r\nto which we are led by misunderstandings and the \r\nabsence of dialogue. \r\n Our delegation aligns itself with the statement by \r\nthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and \r\nCooperation of Portugal, who, speaking on behalf of \r\nthe European Union, mentioned resolution 61/161, \r\nadopted by consensus last year by this Assembly, on \r\nthe elimination of all forms of intolerance and \r\ndiscrimination based on religion or belief, as an \r\nexample of a commitment aiming at guaranteeing that \r\nfundamental freedom. \r\n We also fully subscribe to the initiative presented \r\nby Spain and Turkey in support of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Joe Pemagbi, Chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Sierra Leone. \r\n Mr. Pemagbi (Sierra Leone): The delegation of \r\nSierra Leone welcomes the opportunity to participate \r\nin this High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace. \r\nWe take note with appreciation of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and peace (A/62/337) and the \r\nreport of the Director-General of the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \r\n(UNESCO) on the International Decade for a Culture \r\nof Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the \r\nWorld, 2001-2010 (A/62/97). The involvement of civil \r\nsociety in those activities and their participation in this \r\ndialogue should serve as a reminder of the fact that the \r\npromotion of understanding, peace and cooperation is \r\nnot the exclusive prerogative of Governments. \r\n This dialogue should, first of all, serve as a \r\nreminder of our obligations under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the principles enshrined in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, in particular \r\nto promote and encourage respect for human rights and \r\nfor fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as \r\nto race, sex, language or religion. \r\n Secondly, we should remind ourselves that the \r\nUnited Nations is itself the epitome of intercultural \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace.  \r\n Here we are, in this great Hall, and under one \r\ndome, as representatives of the peoples of the world: \r\nmen and women of all races from almost 200 nations, \r\nrepresenting peoples of all beliefs and shades of \r\nunbelief, speaking hundreds of languages and dialects. \r\nIn spite of political and other differences, and \r\nsometimes communicating in discordant tones, we try \r\nto interact, to respect one another, to tolerate one \r\nanother and, to paraphrase the Charter, to practise \r\ntolerance and live together in peace with one another as \r\ngood neighbours. \r\n Tolerance is one of the seven national values of \r\nSierra Leone. In spite of its status in the international \r\nsystem of economic and social development, Sierra \r\nLeone enjoys one of the highest levels of religious \r\ntolerance in the world today. Indeed, Sierra Leone is a \r\nmodel of interreligious understanding. As former \r\nPresident Kabbah once observed in a Ramadan \r\nmessage to the nation, “Those who want to see \r\nreligious tolerance at its best, let them come to Sierra \r\nLeone.” In a few days’ time, in connection with Eid \r\nal-Fitr, the end of the holy month of Ramadan, \r\nMuslims and Christians in Sierra Leone will all join in \r\nthe celebration of Ramadan. Major religious \r\nobservances such as the feasts of Eid al-Adha, Good \r\nFriday, Easter, Christmas and Ramadan are national \r\nholidays in Sierra Leone. It is not uncommon for a \r\nChristian and Muslim couple to perform the rites of \r\nholy matrimony in a church or in a mosque. I should \r\nadd that virtually every public meeting opens with \r\nshort Muslim and Christian prayers. We are proud of \r\nthose practices, because they help to promote respect, \r\ntolerance and understanding. \r\n In our view, religion should, as far as possible, be \r\nused as an instrument of national development. We \r\nacknowledge the important role that religious \r\ninstitutions and denominations have played and are still \r\nplaying in the establishment and maintenance of \r\nprimary and secondary schools in Sierra Leone. We \r\nhave also used religion positively as an instrument of \r\npeace, healing, reconciliation and national cohesion, \r\nespecially in connection with the 11-year rebel war. \r\nFor instance, the Inter-Religious Council of Sierra \r\nLeone made a significant contribution to the peace \r\nprocess. \r\n We acknowledge that education, like religion, can \r\nbe a powerful tool for promoting peace and \r\ncooperation. Having emerged from armed conflict, \r\nSierra Leone has found it necessary to create and \r\nimplement a number of peace education programmes \r\nand projects. For instance, as indicated in paragraph 3 \r\nof the report prepared by the Director-General of \r\nUNESCO in connection with activities for the \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n25 07-53003 \r\n \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and \r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World, the \r\nagency has coordinated a project on integrating peace \r\nand intercultural understanding in formal and \r\nnon-formal education programmes. We support the \r\nrecommendation in the report for increasing \r\neducational efforts to develop curricula, textbooks and \r\nactivities that teach cultural and religious tolerance. \r\n Peace education has also been developed at the \r\ntertiary education level. In cooperation with the \r\nUniversity of Bradford in the United Kingdom, we now \r\nhave a peace and conflict studies degree-granting \r\nprogramme at the University of Sierra Leone. The \r\nprogramme needs further support to strengthen its \r\ncurriculum in the areas of conflict prevention and \r\nmanagement, including indigenous or transitional \r\nforms of conciliation and resolution. \r\n In the area of non-formal public education, the \r\nNational Commission for Democracy and Human \r\nRights is also demonstrating the importance of \r\neducation in promoting peace and understanding in \r\nSierra Leone. Established during the course of the \r\narmed conflict, the Commission is the leading \r\ninstitution for educating the public about the \r\nConstitution, democratic principles and the promotion \r\nof a culture of peace, tolerance, reconciliation, respect \r\nfor others’ values, patriotism and loyalty to the State. \r\nThe objectives of the Commission are, in effect, \r\nconsistent with conflict prevention. \r\n Sierra Leone believes that the media constitute \r\none of the most potent instruments for the promotion of \r\nintercultural understanding, cooperation and peace. \r\nUnfortunately, in a few unfortunate instances, the \r\nmedia at both the national and international levels \r\nhave, consciously or unconsciously, fanned the flames \r\nof intolerance. After all, irrespective of our professions \r\nand our national and corporate interests, we are tenants \r\nof one world. We are all potential victims of the \r\nconsequences of intolerance, especially extreme forms \r\nof religious, ethnic and cultural intolerance. \r\n My delegation therefore endorses the \r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the \r\nUNESCO Director-General, urging the media, at the \r\ninternational and national levels, to support the global \r\ncampaign for a culture of peace and a dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and peoples. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Anwar Toman \r\nBarout Saleem Al Barout, chairman of the delegation \r\nof the United Arab Emirates. \r\n Mr. Al Barout (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): It gives me pleasure at the outset to express on \r\nbehalf of the United Arab Emirates our thanks and \r\nappreciation for the President’s remarkable efforts in \r\nguiding the work of this session. We are confident that \r\nhis expertise and skills will effectively contribute to \r\nthe successful achievement of the General Assembly’s \r\nobjectives. \r\n Historical events have proven that the \r\ncontinuation of some cases of aggression, occupation, \r\nviolence, contradictions, imbalances and cultural and \r\neconomic hegemony of developed States against \r\ndeveloping nations have exacerbated the feelings of \r\ninjustice, inequality and marginalization among the \r\npeoples of some of those developing nations. Those \r\nfeelings were associated with new forms of hostility \r\nand mistrust among communities. They provided the \r\nbreeding grounds for the emergence of new security \r\nthreats, including extremism, terror, violence and \r\nrevenge. This prompts us, now more than ever, to \r\nendeavour to contain the root causes of those \r\nphenomena, reverse the growing disparities among \r\ncommunities and enhance closeness and \r\nrapprochement among these communities in \r\naccordance with the principles of transparency, justice \r\nand equality, as called for in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights.  \r\n The United Arab Emirates has supported all \r\nefforts by the Secretary-General and by States and \r\nGovernments to reinforce the concept of dialogue \r\namong civilizations and promote a culture of peace and \r\nrespect for religions. Our State was among the first to \r\nlend its strong support to the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nan initiative launched by the Secretary-General in \r\n2005. We made a contribution of $1 million for \r\nstrengthening its mechanisms on the basis of our belief \r\nin the need to mobilize international, collective and \r\nconcerted action to create a new global environment in \r\nwhich all States are able to live peacefully.  \r\n The United Arab Emirates, which believes in the \r\nprinciple of respect for human dignity and the rights \r\nand beliefs of all human beings without exception \r\naccording to the teachings of Islam, has enacted the \r\nnecessary legislation and regulations for protecting the \r\nfundamental rights and freedoms of all its inhabitants, \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 26 \r\n \r\nincluding all residents and foreigners working in the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, regardless of their nationality, \r\nreligion, language or origin. Convinced that science, \r\nculture and knowledge are the foundations for the \r\nprogress of nations and the cornerstones for the \r\nbuilding of human civilization, the United Arab \r\nEmirates has implemented a number of initiatives in \r\norder to strengthen its cultural ties with the rest of the \r\nworld. Among those initiatives was the $2 million \r\nZayed book award, designed to motivate and encourage \r\noutstanding writers and intellectuals who contribute to \r\nvarious fields of Arab culture and human culture as a \r\nwhole. Efforts were also made to bring the experience \r\nof the world’s most prestigious universities and \r\nmuseums to the United Arab Emirates by, for example, \r\nlaunching the Sorbonne Abu Dhabi University and \r\ninaugurating the Louvre Abu Dhabi and Guggenheim \r\nAbu Dhabi museums. The Emirates Foundation was \r\nalso established, in order to raise our educational, \r\ntechnological, intellectual and research resources to the \r\nhighest global level.  \r\n The United Arab Emirates has also hosted several \r\nmeetings, conferences and workshops in order to \r\npromote the exchange of knowledge, expertise and \r\nculture and advance interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue and understanding. We have participated in \r\nbilateral, regional and international programmes aimed \r\nat achieving concerted action to bring together peoples \r\nof different cultures and civilizations and to strengthen \r\ntolerance, respect and dialogue among them.  \r\n Our State’s interest in promoting intercultural \r\ndialogue extends beyond the national level to include \r\ndirect contributions for the protection of the common \r\nheritage of mankind. Further, initiatives undertaken \r\ninclude: the humanitarian cultural initiative launched \r\nthree days ago by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed \r\nBin Rashed Al Maktoum, our Vice-President and Prime \r\nMinister, whose goals is to educate one million \r\nchildren in the poor regions of the world; the election \r\nlast June of the UNESCO Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee in charge of implementing the Convention \r\nfor the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural \r\nHeritage; the biennial $150,000 Zayed award for \r\nheritage, under the auspices of UNESCO, which aims \r\nat promoting human activity and protecting all forms \r\nof cultural heritage, including the preservation of \r\nmasterpieces of traditional, folkloric and other \r\nintangible and endangered heritage in the world; the \r\ncultural weeks organized in various capitals in the \r\nworld to introduce the long-standing cultural traditions \r\nand achievements of the United Arab Emirates; the \r\ninternational Culture Village established in Dubai to \r\nhost various culturally diverse museums, exhibitions \r\nand theatres from all over the world; the Sultan Bin Ali \r\nAl Owais Cultural Foundation, which supported and \r\nhonoured various national, Arab and international \r\neminent personas for their literary, cultural and \r\nhumanitarian achievements; and specialized \r\ninternational seminars and exhibitions organized every \r\nyear by the workshop on culture and science since \r\n1978. \r\n The Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and \r\nHeritage is also in charge of developing cultural \r\npolicies, plans and programmes with a view to \r\npreserving, developing and promoting the cultural \r\nidentity of the United Arab Emirates at the \r\ninternational level. The Emirates Centre for Strategic \r\nStudies and Research issues publications, reports and \r\nstudies in English and Arabic and organizes annual \r\nconferences, seminars and workshops to promote \r\nscientific, informational, cultural and research \r\nexchange and to cooperate with different regional and \r\ninternational research centres in serving the objectives \r\nof cultural rapprochement in all areas of human \r\nrelations. \r\n In conclusion, we endorse the report of the High-\r\nlevel Group for the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nestablished by the Secretary-General and its important \r\npolitical views on the pressing nature of the Palestinian \r\nquestion, which is the main factor behind the widening \r\ngap between Muslim and Western societies today. We \r\ncall upon the General Assembly, to pay serious heed to \r\nthe recommendations of the High-level Group, which \r\ndemand that Israel accept and facilitate the process of \r\nestablishing an independent and viable Palestinian \r\nState, living side by side with Israel in peace and \r\nsecurity, in accordance with international law and the \r\nrelevant legitimate resolutions. In this way, the state of \r\nhostility and conflict in the region can be ended, and \r\nwe can avoid its negative consequences, which have \r\nbeen the leading cause of the outbreak of violence, \r\nincitement and tension, not only in the Middle East, but \r\nin many different regions in recent years. In this \r\ncontext, we would also like to stress the need to \r\ncompel Israel to halt all measures aimed at obliterating \r\nPalestinian cultural and national identity in the \r\noccupied territories, including its ongoing attempts to \r\nravage religious, educational and cultural sites, \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n27 07-53003 \r\n \r\nforemost among which are Al-Quds Al-Sharif and the \r\nAl-Aqsa Mosque, which constitute a flagrant violation \r\nof the provisions of international law, human rights and \r\nthe principle of cultural diversity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Prasad Kariyawasam, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Sri Lanka. \r\n Mr. Kariyawasam (Sri Lanka): The High-level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace is taking \r\nplace at an opportune moment. The decision by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to convene this event is a \r\nmanifestation of the interest of the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations in promoting a \r\ndialogue on this important issue. Let me take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate the delegations of Pakistan \r\nand the Philippines on spearheading the adoption of \r\nresolution 61/269, which paved the way for this event. \r\nThis initiative will no doubt build on several similar \r\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations in the \r\nrecent past, including the dialogue among civilizations.  \r\n The fact that this meeting takes place on the eve \r\nof the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and at the \r\ncommencement of the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly makes it doubly significant. \r\n We humans inherently possess both diverse and \r\ncommon values and ethics based on specific \r\ncircumstances and age-old traditions. While the \r\ncommonality of our beliefs can unite us, the diversity \r\nof our views and traits can enrich our knowledge and \r\nlife experience. Our diversity therefore need not be a \r\ncause for division or conflict.  \r\n As human civilization began to advance, the great \r\nteachers and messengers of peace identified, in the \r\nvery early years of human advancement, the need for \r\nhuman beings to cooperate for coexistence and to \r\npromote peace in society and community. All \r\npredominant religions in the world have, at their core, \r\ncompassion and the promotion of peace. It is within \r\nthat framework that the international community needs \r\nto focus on interreligious and intercultural cooperation \r\nfor peace, and it is timely that this Assembly is giving \r\na sense of direction to this dialogue. \r\n The key to success is promoting common values \r\nand aspects in all religions and cultural traditions that \r\npromote understanding between cultures and religions \r\nand engender respect for diversity and for others. In \r\nthis effort it is essential to emphasize the word \r\n“tolerance” in its broadest possible sense. Tolerance \r\nimplies our respect for the unknown and even \r\nempathizing with dislike. Several great religions in the \r\nworld have taught us the essence of tolerance in \r\ndifferent manifestations. \r\n My country, Sri Lanka, in its 2,500-year recorded \r\nhistory, has remained multicultural and multireligious. \r\nThe creed of tolerance taught in Buddhism has been \r\ningrained in our society ever since the teachings of the \r\nBuddha took root in my country under the patronage of \r\nEmperor Ashoka of India. Tolerance and compassion \r\ntowards the other has been the key to our civilization. \r\nAs an island nation, it has been our tradition to \r\nwelcome all new ideas and influences and to integrate \r\nnew trends into our society, complementing what \r\nalready exists and promoting understanding of and \r\ncooperation with the new. Religious diversity has never \r\nbeen a cause for division. In fact, in Sri Lanka it is \r\ncommon to find Buddhist temples, Christian churches, \r\nMuslim mosques and Hindu temples within close \r\nproximity of one another and often on the same street. \r\nThey coexist in harmony, with the worshippers at each \r\nshrine assisting the others. Tolerance of others’ \r\nreligions is a tradition that we hold dear. \r\n While Buddhism, the predominant religion in my \r\ncountry, has contributed to the mainstream ethos in Sri \r\nLanka, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and other \r\nreligions have coexisted with it and have enriched the \r\nvalues of our people, thus making interreligious \r\ncooperation and understanding a fact of everyday life. \r\nThe key to that trend has been the tolerance and \r\nunderstanding displayed by those who adhere to the \r\nvarious religions in my country. \r\n It is essential that we understand the unity of \r\nthought and the essence of truth in all major religions, \r\nwhich promote similar values for the good of human \r\nbeings. No religion promotes hurting others for any \r\npurpose. For example, Buddhism says, “Do not hurt \r\nothers in ways that you yourself would find hurtful”. \r\nTaoism says, “Regard your neighbour’s gain as your \r\nown gain and your neighbour’s loss as your own loss”. \r\nChristianity says, “All things whatsoever ye would that \r\nmen should do unto you, even so do ye also unto \r\nthem”. Confucius says, “Do not do to others what you \r\ndo not want them to do to you”. Islam says, “Do unto \r\nall men as you would they should do unto you, and \r\nreject for others what you would reject for yourself”. \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 28 \r\n \r\nHinduism says, “Let no one do to others what he would \r\nnot have done to himself”. \r\n In this age of exponentially advancing technology \r\nand interconnectedness, there is a tendency for \r\npredominant economic and political power to manifest \r\nitself as a force of cultural domination, overwhelming \r\nvulnerable and weak societies. This trend, when \r\nperceived as unwelcome, can act against understanding \r\nand cooperation, thus causing societies and peoples to \r\nbecome militant. It is therefore essential to be sensitive \r\nto such phenomena and to take cognizance of the right \r\nof every individual, every community and every \r\nsociety to stand on its own and to cooperate and \r\nunderstand of its own volition. \r\n In that context, we welcome the Dialogue taking \r\nplace today in the General Assembly. It is our belief \r\nthat frank exchanges of views on all aspects of \r\nreligious and cultural commonality and diversity will \r\nhelp the peoples of our globalizing world to promote \r\npeace and understanding. \r\n We have just celebrated the International Day of \r\nNon-Violence in the General Assembly as a tribute to \r\nMahatma Gandhi, in recognition of his efforts to \r\nspread the creed of non-violence throughout the \r\nmodern world. It is auspicious that this meeting is \r\ntaking place in the wake of that event. A view that he \r\nexpressed is very relevant to our discourse today:  \r\n  “I do not want my house to be walled in on \r\nall sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want \r\nthe cultures of all the lands to be blown about my \r\nhouse as freely as possible. But I refuse to be \r\nblown off my feet by any.” \r\nThose words of Mahatma Gandhi sum up the approach \r\nthat we need in order to promote interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation for peace. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Youcef Yousfi, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Algeria. \r\n Mr. Yousfi (Algeria) (spoke in French): Algeria \r\nwelcomes the holding of this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace, particularly since it is taking \r\nplace within the United Nations, which remains the \r\nnatural framework for dialogue among civilizations, \r\nthe melting pot of cultures and the irreplaceable \r\nrostrum for opinions that characterize the human \r\nfamily. \r\n Mr. Kiriyawasam (Sri Lanka), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n What are the results of the implementation of the \r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, \r\nadopted in 2001? What is the state of interreligious \r\ndialogue and, by extension, the dialogue among \r\ncultures and civilizations in a globalized world that, as \r\nnoted by the Chinese professor Tu Wei-ming, is \r\nobviously far from being a place where dialogue, \r\nharmony and peace prevail?  \r\n How do we oppose the culture of ignorance, \r\nscorn for others, stereotypes, discrimination based on \r\nculture and religion, deliberate equivocation, \r\nsupporters of the clash of civilizations, defamation of \r\nreligions, and racist and xenophobic political platforms \r\nand statements, which are, quite simply, insults to \r\nhuman intelligence? \r\n Interreligious dialogue is essential to prevent the \r\ndevelopment of disastrous wars between religions, \r\nwhich, because they share a sense of the sacred, all \r\nbear messages of peace, tolerance and salvation. \r\n It is particularly unfortunate to note that, in \r\ntoday’s world, many prejudices have clouded the \r\nunderstanding of Islam by suggesting that that religion \r\nof peace is synonymous with oppression, intolerance, \r\nextremism and terrorism, whereas it preaches respect \r\nand values dialogue.  \r\n In the holy Koran and in the Sunna, interreligious \r\ndialogue and the right of every individual to freedom \r\nof thought and religion are unequivocally affirmed. \r\nIslam considers variety and human diversity to be \r\nassets, and people are invited to move beyond mere \r\ncoexistence and to actively seek to engage in dialogue \r\nand to develop relationships of mutual assistance and \r\nsolidarity. \r\n As a result of its geographic situation, my \r\ncountry lies at the crossroads of several civilizations. \r\nThat situation has given us an openness to others and a \r\nbroad perspective on world affairs.  \r\n Algeria, which witnessed the birth and \r\naccomplishments of the great thinker and philosopher \r\nSaint Augustine, who made contributions to universal \r\nprogress and, more specifically, to the development of \r\nWestern thought, has always supported human \r\nendeavours to promote the culture of peace, dialogue \r\namong civilizations and interreligious understanding \r\nand to enshrine cultural diversity.  \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n29 07-53003 \r\n \r\n My country, which endorses the Global Agenda \r\nfor Dialogue among Civilizations, adopted by \r\nresolution 56/6, took an active part, through the person \r\nof His Excellency President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in \r\nthe International Conference on the Dialogue among \r\nCivilizations, Cultures and Peoples, held on 5 April \r\n2005 at UNESCO headquarters, and expresses its \r\nsupport for the Alliance of Civilizations initiative. \r\nAlgeria hopes that that initiative will be able to make \r\nan effective, practical, frank and courageous \r\ncontribution to our collective efforts for peace, \r\nunderstanding and tolerance. We welcome the recent \r\nappointment of the High Representative for the \r\nAlliance. \r\n Algeria also believes that any idea of dialogue \r\nand cooperation would be meaningless if the \r\ninternational community does not at the same time \r\naddress the imperative of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. To that end, it is urgent that the \r\ninternational community tackle poverty, \r\nunderdevelopment and environmental degradation, \r\nwhich are universal scourges that transcend cultural \r\ndifferences.  \r\n Any idea of dialogue must be long-term and must \r\nbe affirmed as an ongoing means of bringing people \r\nand communities closer together and spreading the \r\nculture of peace everywhere and at all levels. \r\n Before concluding, I wish to reiterate my \r\ncountry’s gratitude to UNESCO’s Culture Sector, \r\nparticularly its Interreligious Dialogue programme, but \r\nalso to its Education and Social and Human Sciences \r\nsectors, which remain the best defences against \r\nignorance and conflict and natural vehicles for \r\nhumanism, critical reason, harmony and peace. \r\nCertainly much has been done to bring human beings \r\ncloser to each other, to dispel misunderstanding and to \r\navoid prejudgments. However, much remains to be \r\ndone. We have the necessary tools but we must all \r\nshow greater commitment and responsibility. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Adiyatwidi Adiwoso Asmady, \r\nchairperson of the delegation of Indonesia. \r\n Mrs. Asmady (Indonesia): Allow me to join \r\nothers in expressing appreciation for the convening of \r\nthis High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace. \r\nThat this event is taking place at such a level is \r\nindicative of the importance attached to the issue. We \r\nshare that view. \r\n Indonesia is convinced that dialogue among \r\nnations helps in the cultivation of a culture of peace. \r\nThat is why Indonesia has always been an enthusiastic \r\nsupporter of dialogue among civilizations as a way of \r\nbringing the peoples of the world closer together. We \r\nsee dialogue as an essential tool for building bridges \r\nbetween faiths and cultures. At the grass roots, it is an \r\neffective tool for peace if it is carried out intensively \r\nand extensively. \r\n Since tension and conflict may arise not only \r\nbetween those who profess different religions but also \r\nbetween factions within the same religion, intrafaith \r\ndialogue should also be encouraged in order to foster \r\nharmony among those who profess the same religion. \r\n Indonesia is committed to promoting \r\ninterreligious and intercultural understanding and \r\ncooperation. We have a centuries-old tradition of \r\ndialogue called “musyawarah”, which means \r\nconsultation, and “mufakat”, which stands for \r\nconsensus. The practice of consultation and consensus-\r\nseeking has been our way of dealing with pluralism \r\nand bringing it to the benefit of everyone. That is how \r\nwe have sustained our cultural diversity without \r\nsacrificing national unity. \r\n As a result of that outlook and in a country of \r\ngreat diversity and size, we see diversity as a blessing, \r\nnot a disadvantage. Although it is also capable of \r\nleading to misunderstanding and tension, in such cases \r\nwe are able to take advantage of those traditional tools \r\nas well as modern ones. \r\n One of the modern tools is education, which is \r\nessential in promoting harmony in diversity. A good \r\neducation teaches children about unity and common \r\nthreads. It emphasizes that differences in theology and \r\ncultural traditions do not make anyone inferior or \r\npreclude people from living and working together in \r\npeace. \r\n That is why the Ministry of Religion in Indonesia \r\nis conducting courses for teachers in Islamic boarding \r\nschools on the subject of religious and cultural \r\ndiversity. The objective is to teach how to foster an \r\nopen-minded view of pluralism in the country. We want \r\nto stress the consciousness that diversity should be \r\nembraced and celebrated. \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 30 \r\n \r\n Indonesia’s dialogue on the issue is also reflected \r\nin our regional and interregional engagements, such as \r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and \r\nthe Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). We are also \r\npromoting it on a bilateral basis with countries of \r\ndifferent religious and cultural backgrounds. \r\n Furthermore, the Government supports the efforts \r\nof non-governmental actors working in various areas to \r\npromote interreligious harmony. In recent times, we \r\nhave had the International Conference of Islamic \r\nScholars, which was sponsored by Nandlatul Ulama, \r\nthe largest Muslim organization in Indonesia, and the \r\nWorld Peace Forum, which was hosted by \r\nMuhammadiyah, the second largest Muslim \r\norganization in the country. \r\n We also see mass media as a partner in that \r\nendeavour because it is the daily intermediary between \r\npeople and ideas. I am glad to say that the mass media \r\nin Indonesia is mindful of the need to promote \r\ninterreligious and intercultural harmony. As a matter of \r\nstrategy, we are happy to involve the media in our \r\nefforts to promote dialogue. \r\n We recognize that no matter what is done, society \r\nwill always have some elements of conflict and \r\ntension. That is normal: it is the nature of all human \r\nsociety. Rather than be discouraged, we must continue \r\nto work hard to encourage, inspire and promote \r\nharmony. The situation calls not for cynicism, but for \r\ngreater investment of imagination and effort. \r\n As for the way forward, we believe that more \r\nefforts should be made at the national level to promote \r\nconscious actions to create harmony among \r\ncommunities and to undertake appropriate education \r\nforums. \r\n Non-governmental organizations and the media \r\nshould play an important role in bringing people of \r\ndifferent backgrounds closer together. At the \r\ninternational level, we hope the United Nations will \r\ninstitutionalize interfaith and intercultural initiatives \r\nand strengthen the role of the relevant agencies on the \r\nissue. We also stress the importance of resolving major \r\ninternational disputes, especially where they involve \r\nfriction between religions and faiths. \r\n It is our fervent hope that this dialogue will not \r\nonly complement but also strengthen other initiatives \r\nthat build bridges of understanding and goodwill \r\nessentially forming a universal web of conversation \r\nand cooperation among people of different beliefs and \r\ncultural backgrounds in the common interest of all \r\nhumankind. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nebojša Kaludjerović, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Montenegro. \r\n Mr. Kaludjerović (Montenegro): I would like \r\nfirst of all to express my appreciation to the President \r\nfor the convening of this important meeting. I would \r\nalso like to thank the Philippines and Pakistan for their \r\ncommendable initiative in creating this dialogue. We \r\nfind that the preservation and enhancement of the \r\ninterreligious and intercultural legacy present a \r\npractical contribution to the need to abbreviate the road \r\nfrom an idea to its implementation. \r\n Today’s High-level Dialogue on Interreligious \r\nand Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for \r\nPeace is in this regard a very well-focused forum. As \r\nwe are all well aware, ideas alone are often \r\ninsufficient. We are fully confident that the United \r\nNations is an excellent framework for the best practical \r\nand creative development of intercultural and interfaith \r\ncooperation among various nations. The United \r\nNations possesses the confidence of its Member States \r\nto be the right forum for addressing differences of \r\nvarious traditions in spiritual and religious matters. \r\nThat is best shown in the spirit of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which has remained an \r\ninspiration for all of us for the past six decades. \r\n Cultural and interreligious interactions strengthen \r\nrelationships between the United Nations and civil \r\nsociety. That kind of strong involvement is essential to \r\nthe topics we are discussing today. \r\n Montenegrin culture belongs to the millennia-old \r\ncircles of the Mediterranean, the cradle of civilization. \r\nIts place in this tremendously dynamic and vibrant part \r\nof the world has never been a petrified or a dull one. \r\nWe have witnessed constant streams of events and \r\nchanges which have added to the image of the society \r\nthat we all share today in Montenegro. I quote Fernand \r\nBraudel:  \r\n “Our sea was from the very dawn of its \r\nprotohistory a witness to those imbalances \r\nproductive of exchange which would set the \r\nrhythm of its entire life.”  \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n31 07-53003 \r\n \r\nI believe that that most excellently depicts the actual \r\nMediterranean fabric into which my nation has been \r\nwoven.  \r\n Montenegro is a country possessing genuine \r\nmulti-ethnic and multiconfessional understanding. That \r\nis one of our most prominent values, which we have \r\ncherished and striven to safeguard and promote. I \r\nshould recall that during the turbulent last decade of \r\nthe twentieth century, Montenegro remained a safe \r\nhaven of multi-ethnic and multireligious tolerance and \r\naccord in a region where abuses and atrocities were \r\nvery often committed in the name of religion. The \r\ncoexistence and mutual respect of Orthodoxy, \r\nCatholicism and Islam helped us to save lives, peace \r\nand our land.  \r\n As the Montenegrin President stated at the \r\nRegional Summit of Heads of State of South-East \r\nEurope, held in Bucharest in June under the auspices of \r\nUNESCO, “Harmony of religious and ethnic relations \r\nis the greatest treasure of Montenegro”. We are \r\ntherefore bound to preserve and enhance this legacy, \r\nworking together not only in Montenegro, but with our \r\nneighbours in the Balkan region — which, at this very \r\nmoment, must show its readiness for the European \r\nperspective that is so obvious. In that regard we \r\nwelcome and support the Euro-Mediterranean \r\nBarcelona process and the proposed 2008 European \r\nYear of Intercultural Dialogue as an expression of \r\nEuropean mobilization to continue with the dialogue \r\namong cultures.  \r\n Let me also emphasize the importance of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, which in our view presents \r\nan exceptional framework for developing national and \r\ninternational strategies and action plans. By becoming \r\na member of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, Montenegro, a small Mediterranean and \r\nEuropean country which for a millennium has engaged \r\nin intercultural and interfaith discourse, can contribute \r\nto the development of this process. Intercultural and \r\ninterreligious understanding lays the basis for \r\ncooperation in many other areas such as the economy, \r\nindustry, tourism and political and public life.  \r\n We are of the view that the main messages \r\nstemming from this forum should lead to finding \r\nconcrete modalities for putting the ideas of the \r\nDialogue into practice. In doing so we have, among \r\nother things, to bring these messages to the younger \r\ngenerations, as suggested in the conclusions of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, since young people are \r\nimportant and active promoters of dialogue. In this \r\ncontext, education represents a very significant part of \r\nthe process of enabling young people to engage in \r\nintercultural and interreligious exchange; I cannot \r\nstress enough the importance that my country attaches \r\nto that.  \r\n Montenegro is ready to be the host and promoter \r\nof relevant programmes and activities which should \r\nlead to an increased understanding of the variety of \r\ncultures and religions. Only by reaching out to accept \r\ndiversity can we become a real partner of the modern \r\nworld. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdullah Ahmed Mohamed \r\nAl-Murad, chairman of the delegation of Kuwait. \r\n Mr. Al-Murad (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould like at the outset to thank the President for \r\nconvening this High-Level Dialogue on Interreligious \r\nand Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for \r\nPeace. I am totally convinced that the dialogue among \r\nsocieties and nations contributes to a culture of peace.  \r\n I was pleased yesterday to chair panel \r\ndiscussion 2, on best practices and strategies on \r\ninterreligious and intercultural cooperation going \r\nforward. The discussion was positive and useful, and \r\nwe believe that it will help lead to mutual \r\nunderstanding, trust and agreement with a view to \r\nattaining lasting peace.  \r\n During the last 10 days of the holy month of \r\nRamadan, I would like to extend my greetings and best \r\nwishes to all Muslims and to believers of other \r\nreligions.  \r\n For several years now, cultural and religious \r\ndifferences and conflicts have raged and, if left \r\nunchecked, could pose a threat to international peace \r\nand security and a direct threat to human civilization. \r\nThis could also lead to destruction and to planting fear \r\nand terror in human hearts. Religious conflicts bear the \r\nseeds of destruction; if we turn the pages of history, we \r\ncan see that religious differences have often been a \r\nsource of conflict and war.  \r\n All religions promote similar spiritual and moral \r\nprinciples and ideals, common values that promote \r\ncooperation and peace. Islam, for example, recognizes \r\nthe multiplicity and diversity of ethnic groups, races \r\nand genders. God says in the Koran, \r\nA/62/PV.18  \r\n \r\n07-53003 32 \r\n \r\n “O mankind, we created you from a single pair of \r\na male and a female and made you into nations \r\nand tribes that you might know each other. Verily, \r\nthe most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is \r\nhe who is the most righteous among you.” \r\n (XLIX:13) \r\n We believe that other religions are based on those \r\nsame principles and values. We should therefore work \r\ntogether to transform the world’s culture from one of \r\nwar to one of peace through dialogue and \r\nunderstanding, not through threats and killing. This \r\ndialogue should take place, not only at the international \r\nlevel, but also at the national level, and not only in \r\ntheory, but also in practice.  \r\n We should recognize that dialogue between \r\npeoples and religions will contribute to understanding, \r\nfriendship and good relations and has a major role to \r\nplay in strengthening international peace and security. \r\nWe believe that dialogue and cooperation between \r\nreligions has today become an integral part of the \r\npolitical scene. We should recognize that to accept \r\nreligious and cultural diversity and to strive for a \r\nculture of peace, openness and respect for the religions, \r\ntraditions and cultures of others, we must establish \r\ninternal mechanisms and provide the necessary \r\nresources to fight violence and intolerance against \r\nother ethnicities, religions and races, while respecting \r\nthe belief systems and creeds of others. Strengthening \r\nan approach of moderation between religions will \r\nensure the realization of a great measure of \r\nunderstanding. The Ministry of Endowment and \r\nReligious Affairs of Kuwait has adopted and is \r\nstrengthening such a moderate approach, in accordance \r\nwith Government directives and guidelines. Kuwait has \r\nheld several international conferences on the subject of \r\nmoderation in Islam, including one held in November \r\nof last year in Washington, D.C., attended by 100 \r\nMuslim and non-Muslim scholars. The conference \r\ndiscussed the dangers of extremism and the importance \r\nof strengthening moderation in all religions and \r\npromoting religious tolerance. \r\n I am pleased to mention that yesterday, \r\n4 October, the Foreign Affairs Council of the Gulf sent \r\na peace and friendship message to all States. It stresses \r\nthe urgent need to engage in religious tolerance and to \r\ncombat extremism. That message conveys our work in \r\nspreading religious tolerance, which is the key to peace \r\nand understanding around the world. We stress the \r\nacceptance of others on the basis of mutual respect for \r\nand understanding of others.  \r\n Discrimination and doubts that confront Muslims \r\nare a problem everywhere and are a major concern to \r\nus, because it distorts the image of Islam and \r\nundermines relations with other faiths and creeds. \r\nRecent reports have documented an increase in \r\nincidents prompted by fear of Islam and of foreigners \r\nand in hate crimes against Muslims. The negative \r\npolitical discourse in the media against Islam and \r\nMuslims in the West complicates things even further. \r\nLinking terrorism to Islam is unacceptable because it \r\nexacerbates xenophobia in the West against Muslims \r\nand Islam. Millions of Muslims living in the West who \r\nwere already deprived of opportunities in their own \r\ncountries of origin have become targets for \r\ndiscrimination and hatred and are increasingly \r\nmarginalized.  \r\n Allow me to recall here that there are no legal \r\nrestrictions on freedom of expression, but freedom of \r\nexpression must be exercised responsibly and wisely, \r\nwithout affecting the sensitivities of others, especially \r\nin the multicultural societies of today. It is a question \r\nof wisdom and responsibility; it is not a legal issue. \r\nAny expression that affects others in the name of \r\nfreedom is considered irresponsible and provocative \r\nand could generate negative emotions and reactions.  \r\n If the leaders of religious societies truly and \r\neffectively participate in deepening the understanding \r\nof other religions, civilizations and cultural \r\norganizations, it should be possible to find among \r\nthose religions the common noble values that would \r\nallow them to lead their societies towards peace, \r\ntolerance and mutual understanding. Religions are the \r\nsolution and not part of the problem; religious leaders \r\nneed to prove that. \r\n The Islamic Cultural Centre of New York, which \r\nit is my honour to preside over, is the largest Islamic \r\nassociation in New York. It works and strives to \r\ncooperate with others in good will. It would like to \r\nmake itself known to others; that is why it has \r\norganized a series of dialogues and symposia on \r\nreligions, such as the tri-partite dialogue held last \r\nNovember, bringing together Jews, Christians and \r\nMuslims. It commemorated Martin Luther King, Jr., \r\nDay last year. We also participated in the Imams and \r\nRabbis conference on peace in Spain in March of 2005. \r\nThe Islamic Council also sponsored the tripartite \r\n A/62/PV.18\r\n \r\n33 07-53003 \r\n \r\ndialogue with the main New York church and \r\nsynagogue. The Council has also promoted and \r\ncontributed considerably to financing that meeting in \r\nits continuous efforts to build bridges of friendship \r\nbetween people and to deepen the roots of love and \r\ntolerance among all. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to reaffirm my country’s \r\ncommitment to the strengthening of dialogue between \r\nall religions and cultures so that peace and tolerance \r\ncan prevail. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
