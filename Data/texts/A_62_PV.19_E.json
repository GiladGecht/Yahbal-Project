(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Ms. Ataeva \r\n(Turkmenistan), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation \r\nfor Peace \r\n \r\nAgenda item 49 (continued) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/62/97 and \r\nA/62/337) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Before giving the floor to \r\nthe first speaker, I would like to remind members that \r\nthere are still 34 speakers remaining on the list. In \r\norder for us to exhaust the list by this afternoon I \r\nstrongly appeal to speakers to make their statements as \r\nconcise as possible. \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Nassir \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, chairman of the delegation of the \r\nState of Qatar. \r\n Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate the President on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session and to wish him success in his \r\nmission. I also wish to welcome the convening of this \r\nimportant dialogue as it represents a reactivation of the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights. The dialogue is also a response to the \r\nappeals launched by the heads of State and \r\nGovernment at the conclusion of the 2005 World \r\nSummit that stressed the importance of respect for and \r\nunderstanding of religious and cultural diversity and \r\nthe value of dialogue on interreligious cooperation.  \r\n I also wish to take the opportunity to express my \r\ndeep appreciation to the principal sponsors of \r\nresolution 61/221, namely, Pakistan and the \r\nPhilippines, and to the other sponsors, for their tireless \r\nefforts. Thanks to those efforts the idea of convening \r\nthis important dialogue during the current session of \r\nthe Assembly took shape in order to promote \r\nunderstanding, tolerance and friendship among people \r\nof different religions, cultures and languages. \r\n While all religions and cultures share a common \r\nset of human values, manifestations of fanaticism and \r\nreligious and ethnic conflicts are on the rise and \r\nincreasingly constitute a threat to sound relations \r\nbetween States. The State of Qatar was among the first \r\ncountries to note in many regional and international \r\nforums the importance of drawing attention at all levels \r\nto the need to strengthen relations among peoples of \r\ndifferent religious and ethnic backgrounds. In fact, the \r\nState of Qatar submitted to the international \r\ncommunity proposals on how to address religious and \r\ncultural clashes among nations. \r\n In that regard, I wish to recall one of the \r\nimportant proposals made by His Highness Sheikh \r\nHamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the Emir of the State of \r\nQatar, during the round table organized by the United \r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 2 \r\n \r\nat the margins of the Millennium Summit in September \r\n2000. Those proposals addressed ways to achieve the \r\ngoal of strengthening relations among human groups at \r\nthree levels. The first level consists of a purely \r\nscientific mechanism that includes experts in history, \r\npolitics and sociology and aims to expose the root \r\ncauses of the conflict between peoples and cultures. \r\nThe second level targets opinion leaders in various \r\nfields of the media with a view to discovering the best \r\nways to shed light on the impact of misconceptions and \r\nbad images that might be conveyed by media outlets \r\nabout different cultural groups. The third level includes \r\npolitical leaders and government leaders who belong to \r\ndifferent cultural groups, as they would be the most \r\ncapable of uprooting tensions and reducing chances of \r\nclash. \r\n In the context of promoting dialogue among \r\nIslam, Christianity and Judaism, the State of Qatar has \r\nnot confined its role to launching initiatives; it has also \r\nbegun transforming its initiatives and appeals on \r\npromoting interreligious dialogue and mutual \r\nunderstanding into action. The State of Qatar firmly \r\nbelieves in the significance of giving the utmost \r\nimportance to the principle of interreligious dialogue \r\namong the three divine religions in an effort to find \r\nsolid ground to build a world of peace and \r\nunderstanding. \r\n That deep belief has been the driving force that \r\npushed the wise leadership of the State of Qatar, in the \r\nperson of His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, to host in the city of Doha a series of \r\ninternational interreligious conferences in what has \r\nbecome an annual event and which we expect will \r\nstrengthen dialogue and communication. That series \r\nbegan with the first Conference on Interreligious \r\nDialogue, which was held in Doha in April 2003; the \r\nlatest is the fifth Conference, which was held in May \r\n2007. This series of meetings has resulted in an \r\nimportant initiative that established the Doha \r\nInternational Centre for Interreligious Dialogue, which, \r\nin turn, set up an international advisory board to guide \r\nthe work of the Centre in order to bring the three \r\ndivine religions closer together. \r\n The State of Qatar believes that interreligious \r\ndialogue will have a positive impact on the dialogue \r\namong peoples and civilizations. That is the reason \r\nwhy our country has responded positively to the \r\ninitiative of the former Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, to establish \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations. The State of Qatar \r\ncontributed to the work of the High-level Group on the \r\nAlliance, set up by Mr. Annan in 2005, through the \r\nimportant participation of Her Highness Sheikha \r\nMozah bint Nasser al-Missned, the wife of our Emir. \r\nThe Group included a host of eminent leaders from the \r\nfive regional groups and was tasked with developing a \r\nset of initiatives in the areas of education, youth and \r\nmedia in order to achieve the lofty goal of the Alliance: \r\nto bring peoples and cultures closer together to build \r\npeace and stability in a world weary of the scourge of \r\nwar and religious and ideological conflict.  \r\n The State of Qatar will continue its support for \r\nnational, regional and international efforts to promote \r\ndialogue and understanding among religions, cultures \r\nand peoples.  \r\n I wish to conclude my statement by recalling the \r\nwords spoken by His Highness the Emir of the State of \r\nQatar at the opening session of the third Conference on \r\nInterreligious Dialogue, held in 2005, where His \r\nHighness stressed that  \r\n “pursuing dialogue [would] win new adherents \r\nwho believe that dialogue is more effective than \r\nbickering, and that communicating is more useful \r\nthan keeping one’s distance. Dialogue has \r\nbecome an urgent need to get rid of the burdens \r\nof yesterday and recognize the mistakes of \r\ntoday”. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Mona Juul, chairperson of the \r\ndelegation of Norway.  \r\n Mrs. Juul (Norway): Today, the issue of religious \r\nand cultural identity is receiving more attention and is \r\nmore central to global relations than ever before. \r\nReligion and culture define man and woman, and \r\ninfluence how we interact and relate to one another. \r\nOur right to freely choose our religion or belief is \r\nclearly stated in the International Covenant on Civil \r\nand Political Rights. Still, the coexistence of diverse \r\nreligions and cultures at times represents a challenge \r\nfor societies and nations worldwide.  \r\n Religious and cultural identity has always been \r\nused to define the different sides in conflict situations. \r\nIn recent years we have seen how religion has been \r\nused to promote and deepen several conflicts, both \r\nviolent and non-violent. In most cases, the conflicts are \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n3 07-53011 \r\n \r\nreally power struggles over political issues rather than \r\nclashes based on religious differences.  \r\n However, religion and culture can play quite a \r\ndifferent role. Religious and cultural leaders have stood \r\nup against wars and the use of violence. Religious and \r\ncultural leaders as well as non-governmental \r\norganizations can play important roles in enhancing \r\ntolerance and promoting respect for religious and \r\ncultural diversity. They can make valuable \r\ncontributions to peace and justice. In more secular \r\nsocieties there is often a tendency to underestimate that \r\npotential. It is therefore encouraging that national \r\nGovernments and the United Nations, through high-\r\nlevel meetings such as this one, seek to involve those \r\ncommunities in order to better understand and deal \r\nwith the role of religion and culture in national and \r\ninternational politics. We need international arenas \r\nsuch as this forum, where religious, cultural and \r\npolitical leaders can meet and exchange views.  \r\n Norway believes in the potential of interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue. Through dialogue we can \r\nenhance mutual understanding and respect for freedom \r\nof religion and belief and for cultural diversity. \r\nDialogue can have a considerable impact. It represents \r\na possibility to seize the middle ground, and to \r\nchallenge the dominance of the extremes.  \r\n When receiving the Path to Peace Foundation \r\naward, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa said,  \r\n  “Promoting a true dialogue among \r\ncivilizations and religions is perhaps the most \r\nimportant political instrument that we can use to \r\nreach out across borders and build bridges of \r\npeace and hope.”  \r\nFor the same reason, Norway is initiating, supporting \r\nand encouraging dialogue projects in several countries. \r\nThrough those projects, we work closely with religious \r\nleaders in Norway and internationally.  \r\n Moreover, we have established a forum in our \r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs where religious leaders, \r\nacademics and diplomats meet to discuss important \r\nissues related to religion and foreign policy. It is a very \r\nvaluable arena for the Ministry, the religious \r\ncommunities, the non-governmental organizations and \r\nthe research institutes alike.  \r\n Although dialogue is the most important path to \r\ngreater tolerance, respect for diversity and common \r\nunderstanding, dialogue is rarely without obstacles. \r\nDialogue may also challenge decision-makers and \r\nreligious leaders. Respect, acceptance and appreciation \r\nof cultures, traditions and religions must be mutual in \r\norder for dialogue to take place. Without fundamental \r\nrespect for differences and recognition of the human \r\ndignity of the other, there can be no true dialogue. \r\nBasically, this means that we must be willing to both \r\ntalk and listen. We must acknowledge that our dialogue \r\npartner has insights, convictions, values and abilities \r\nthat could potentially make us reconsider our positions.  \r\n Fundamental respect for diversity is indeed a \r\nprerequisite for dialogue. And of course, increased \r\nrespect for differences may also be a result of dialogue. \r\nIt is important to underline that respect for cultural and \r\nreligious diversity should not be misconstrued as \r\nuncritical acceptance of all facets of religion and \r\nculture. Both religious and cultural values can be used \r\nand misused; they can serve both good and bad \r\npurposes. There is often a need to identify elements in \r\na dialogue process that could obstruct the promotion of \r\ntolerance, understanding and universal respect. It is \r\nnecessary to balance respect for each other’s \r\nviewpoints with an open and sometimes critical \r\napproach to issues relating to culture and religion. This \r\nis often challenging, and striking the right balance will \r\ncontinue to be essential in efforts for dialogue.  \r\n Many speak as if there is an ongoing conflict \r\nbetween the so-called Muslim and Western worlds. We \r\ndo not think that there is such a conflict; nor do we \r\nthink that those are the right names for them. The \r\ndiscourse has been polarized and is too often \r\ndominated by extreme elements. This approach, \r\nhowever, prevents us from engaging in fruitful \r\ndiscussions, making it more difficult to find middle \r\nground. Constructive dialogues must necessarily \r\ninvolve people and communities from different \r\nsegments of society.  \r\n It is also important to keep in mind that dialogue \r\ntakes time. It takes time to build the necessary \r\nknowledge, trust and confidence to change our own \r\nperceptions and those of the other party. The time \r\nperspective is not always compatible with national and \r\ninternational political demands for quick and durable \r\nresults. Thus, patience and commitment to dialogue are \r\nnecessary.  \r\n Although dialogue as a political response to \r\nthreats to democracy, peace and stability creates \r\ndilemmas and challenges for decision-makers, there is \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 4 \r\n \r\na definite need for interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue and cooperation among the world’s \r\ncommunities if we are to transform conflict, build \r\npeace and ensure respect for basic human rights. It is \r\nimportant that the United Nations, as the representative \r\nof the international community, continue to promote \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue as an \r\nimportant political mechanism for enhancing mutual \r\nunderstanding and respect for freedom of religion or \r\nbelief and cultural diversity. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Jorge Skinner-Klée, Chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Guatemala.  \r\n Mr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to congratulate those who \r\npromoted the initiative to convene this High-level \r\nDialogue, because the topics that we are discussing are \r\nundeniably timely. No one should forget the valuable \r\ncontribution of religions to civilizations and to the very \r\nidentity of the individuals making up those \r\ncivilizations. This leads us to recognize the need to \r\naccept the obvious cultural diversity that characterizes \r\nthe world of today, which is an inexhaustible source of \r\ncollective and fertile enrichment for contemporary \r\nsocieties.  \r\n Promoting tolerance and dialogue within each \r\ncivilization is essential to generating respect, peaceful \r\ncoexistence and cooperation among individuals and \r\namong peoples, thus protecting the diversity of beliefs, \r\ncultures and languages. All Members of the United \r\nNations and of the human family accept the challenge \r\nof fighting for peace and friendly relations between \r\nStates, which in turn calls for promoting respect for \r\nfundamental freedoms, including the freedom of belief, \r\nthe essential condition of which is tolerance. At the \r\nsame time, tolerance is the premise of respect for the \r\nrights of others; without respect, there is no possibility \r\nof harmony or concord. \r\n I am from a multi-ethnic, multicultural and \r\nmultilingual country. Within that multicultural context, \r\nwe enjoy a freedom of worship that makes our social \r\nfabric multifaceted. We have Christians, Jews and \r\nMuslims living together, alongside a very extensive \r\nand varied indigenous community whose Mayan \r\ncosmological vision has been excluded, debased and \r\noppressed for five centuries. It is being reassessed, \r\nhowever, in the context of contemporary society, \r\nallowing us to alleviate social tensions and inequities, \r\nimprove mutual understanding and prevent racism and \r\ndiscrimination.  \r\n In the context of the peace agreements that ended \r\na 40-year fratricidal war, we have concluded one such \r\nagreement on the identity and rights of indigenous \r\npeoples. The agreements were achieved through years \r\nof dialogue and mutual understanding. In that respect, \r\nwe also wish to acknowledge the virtue and fortitude of \r\nwomen over the centuries, which have allowed cultures \r\nto survive and have protected and transmitted the \r\ngoods and values of tangible and intangible cultural \r\nheritage, while ensuring the education of successive \r\ngenerations. \r\n Guatemala does not see tolerance as a means of \r\ninstitutionalizing inequalities and hierarchies, or of \r\nholding people back and perpetuating their exclusion \r\nand discrimination, thereby trampling the intrinsic \r\ndignity of the individual. We encourage tolerance that \r\npromotes genuine dialogue, opens our minds to the \r\nknowledge of others, and familiarizes us with the \r\nvalues, customs and religion of each culture. Such a \r\ndialogue is an active learning experience and leads to \r\nmutual understanding. Such dialogue is possible \r\nbetween individuals and nations if it is based on \r\nequality, and between cultures and religions if based on \r\nhonesty, equity and, most importantly, respect. \r\n We firmly believe that ignorance leads to the \r\nworst forms of intolerance. In a globalized and \r\ncosmopolitan world, migration, for instance — be it \r\nmotivated by economic reasons or conflicts — has \r\nclearly shown the need for us to learn about one \r\nanother and to promote tolerance, universal values and \r\nmutual understanding in order to achieve peaceful and \r\nfruitful coexistence, with the equal participation of \r\nmen and women. \r\n We therefore pay tribute to this Organization, \r\nwhich has provided the entire human family with \r\ninstruments that allow us to promote the universal \r\nvalues set down in the provisions of the United Nations \r\nCharter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \r\nand the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity. \r\nThe latter even goes so far as to assert that intercultural \r\ndialogue is “the best guarantee of peace” and an \r\n“imperative indissociable from respect for the dignity \r\nof the individual”.  \r\n Guatemala has actively participated in the \r\nUNESCO Culture of Peace programme and supports all \r\ninitiatives, such as that promoted by Turkey and Spain, \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n5 07-53011 \r\n \r\nrelated to the Alliance of Civilizations, as well as the \r\nactivities of the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith \r\nCooperation for Peace. In raising cultural diversity to \r\nthe level of shared heritage of humankind, modern \r\nmulticultural societies have taken a major step towards \r\nrecognizing that this heritage is a living and renewable \r\ntreasure and thus a process that guarantees the survival \r\nof our species. \r\n It is impossible in so few minutes to discuss \r\nformulas that will resolve the long-standing problems \r\narising from exclusion, prejudice, racism, xenophobia, \r\nfanaticism and intolerance. We are encouraged, \r\nhowever, by the fact that the international community \r\nhas at its disposal authoritative instruments that \r\nestablish basic standards for human coexistence. \r\n Now is the time for action to reduce ignorance \r\nabout our neighbours and to attenuate social tensions \r\nwith a view to strengthening international cohesion and \r\nsolidarity. We need to end the clandestine trade behind \r\narmed conflict and war, and truly combat poverty, \r\nhunger, malnutrition and ignorance; racism and \r\nintolerance towards immigrants and ethnic, cultural \r\nand religious minorities; and prejudice and stereotypes \r\nbased on religion or culture. Those are the real triggers \r\nof conflict. We must also recognize that violence is \r\nnever the appropriate response to such problems.  \r\n Mahatma Gandhi said: \r\n “I reject violence, because the good that it \r\nappears to produce does not last long; in contrast, \r\nthe badness that it produces is long-lasting.” \r\nA few days ago before this Assembly, we celebrated \r\nthe anniversary of the birth of the universal humanist \r\nMahatma Gandhi, whose legacy of non-violence is as \r\nrelevant today as it has ever been. It is therefore fitting \r\nthat we should celebrate the International Day of Non-\r\nViolence. We are fully convinced that 365 days a year \r\nshould be devoted to eliminating violence from our \r\nlives and from our thinking, since if we are unable to \r\nform societies that engage in dialogue, grow in respect \r\nfor cultural diversity, cooperate to achieve \r\ndevelopment, and learn to live in peace, we will lose \r\nground to conflict, war and injustice. \r\n Mr. Sahel (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): I am \r\npleased at the outset to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session, and we are hopeful that his \r\nwork will be crowned with success. \r\n I wish also to extend my warmest thanks to \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, who organized \r\nseveral meetings on the topic of interreligious and \r\nintercultural cooperation and understanding.  \r\n Today’s High-level Dialogue is being held in \r\ncircumstances marked by ongoing ethnic and doctrinal \r\nintolerance and violence; hence the importance of such \r\ninitiatives as our meeting today to discuss the optimal \r\navenues of cooperation to achieve greater \r\nunderstanding and rapprochement among religions and \r\ncultures and to uproot all forms of hatred and \r\nextremism.  \r\n On this occasion, we highly appreciate the \r\nstrenuous efforts of the United Nations to consolidate \r\nthe foundations of such dialogue. We also express our \r\nappreciation for the final report of the High-level \r\nGroup for the Alliance of Civilizations, which includes \r\nimportant recommendations to activate and concretize \r\nthe dialogue among cultures and religions. \r\n We wish also to express our gratitude for the \r\nappointment of Mr. Jorge Sampaio as High \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and head of the Group of \r\nFriends of the Alliance so that he can endow that \r\ninitiative with mechanisms to activate the \r\nrecommendations of the High-level Group. As a \r\nmember of the Group, the Kingdom of Morocco will \r\nspare no effort to contribute to the success of its \r\nmission. The Kingdom of Morocco places the issue of \r\ndialogue among cultures and religions at the level of \r\nstrategic options. We believe that there is a pressing \r\nneed to strengthen openness, which will ensure \r\nreligious and cultural coexistence and stability and \r\npeace among States. \r\n Based on this firm conviction and the instructions \r\nof His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Morocco has \r\nlaunched a number of bold and responsible initiatives. \r\nWe recall here, for example, the first World Conference \r\nof Imams and Rabbis, held in Brussels in 2005. The \r\nsecond such conference was held in Seville in 2006 \r\nunder the honorary chairmanship of His Majesty King \r\nMohammed VI and King Juan Carlos of Spain. It \r\nfocused on the important role of dialogue among \r\nreligions as an effective means to combat violence and \r\nmarginalization, and on the main role of men of \r\nreligion in establishing rapprochement among people. \r\n In addition to supporting such initiatives and \r\nattempting to foster serious dialogue among religions \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 6 \r\n \r\nand cultures, Morocco suggested, at the most recent \r\nArab summit in Khartoum, the drafting of an \r\ninternational charter that would specify rules requiring \r\nrespect when referring to the holy sites and spiritual \r\nbeliefs of all peoples. \r\n Through his religious lessons throughout \r\nRamadan, His Majesty King Mohammed VI dealt with \r\ntopics directly related to the spreading of tolerance and \r\nmutual respect within Islam and between Islam and \r\nother religions. Morocco is of the view that the \r\ndialogue among religions and cultures is a main pillar \r\nin the relations among States and should go beyond \r\ncircumstantial requisites and should be part of a \r\ncontinuous process firmly based on respect for human \r\nrights, particularly the rights of freedom, dignity and \r\nlife without discrimination among races, religions, \r\ncultures and nations. \r\n Achieving this requires conscious and continuous \r\nefforts that will enable us to go beyond self-interest \r\nand to enrich our common knowledge and experiences. \r\nKnowledge of the other and understanding the cultures \r\nof others are the only means to overcome hatred and \r\nmalice and will enable us to achieve lasting peace, as \r\nwell as enabling each member of the international \r\ncommunity to live in peace, tranquility and dignity. \r\n We believe that diversity of religious and cultural \r\nactivities and meetings on the international level \r\ncontribute considerably to national and international \r\nawareness of the importance of dialogue among \r\nreligions and its central role in achieving peace. We are \r\nof the view that promoting understanding among \r\nreligions and cultures in educational curricula will lead \r\nto correcting the negative images of the other and \r\nreplacing it with a culture of tolerance and openness. \r\nDialogue among religions and cultures is related to the \r\nneed to defend such crucial issues as our aspiration to \r\nachieve freedom, dignity and development. Affirming \r\nour spiritual and cultural diversity within the \r\nframework of dialogue does not cancel out cooperation \r\nand commitment, but will help us achieve our desired \r\ngoals.  \r\n Morocco, in conclusion, emphasizes the need to \r\ncoordinate all initiatives related to dialogue among \r\nreligions that are embraced by the United Nations so as \r\nto speed up follow-up work on the matter. Establishing \r\na specialized  unit within the Secretariat to take care of \r\nthis is a practical proposal that should be supported. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alisher Vohidov, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Uzbekistan. \r\n Mr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nLet me, at the outset, express gratitude to the \r\norganizers and initiators of this event. There is no \r\ndoubt that we particularly need to note the great \r\ncontribution that the delegations of Pakistan and the \r\nPhilippines have made and thank them for the efforts \r\nthey have undertaken.  \r\n Today’s realities clearly demonstrate the growing \r\nrelevance of the further reinvigoration of international \r\nefforts to strengthen intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue, which, today, can be seen as one of the key \r\nissues on the international agenda. Promoting such a \r\ndialogue is increasingly relevant to augmenting \r\nstability and development in today’s world. \r\n Given this, the role of the United Nations, more \r\nthan ever, is important in encouraging tolerance, \r\nmutual understanding and cultural diversity. We \r\ncommend the importance of the High-level Dialogue \r\ncurrently underway in promoting intercultural and \r\ninterreligious understanding and cooperation for the \r\nbetterment of the world. \r\n Uzbekistan is a multi-ethnic State, where, side by \r\nside, 136 ethnic groups and minorities live together. \r\nSuch ethnic and cultural diversity is something we see \r\nas a national heritage, as a source of fruitful interaction \r\nand enrichment of those people of varying cultures and \r\nethnic groups who live in our country. All this stems \r\nfrom the many years in which cultures and religions \r\nhave interacted in Uzbekistan.  \r\n The territory of Uzbekistan, today and for many \r\ncenturies, has served as a bridge linking East and West. \r\nThanks to its proximity near the great Silk Road, our \r\nancient land became known as an important crossroads \r\non this road where varying civilizations and cultures \r\ninteracted with each other, and this interaction, \r\naccordingly, became famous as an invaluable \r\ncontribution to the development of all humankind.  \r\n In our ancient land, together with the holy sites of \r\nIslam, we carefully preserve unique and distinct \r\nmonuments of Buddhist culture in the Surkhandarya \r\nvalley, Jewish historical monuments in Samarkand and \r\nBukhara, very early monuments of Zoroastrian culture \r\nin Khorezm and pilgrimage sites for Muslims, \r\nChristians and Jews in Samarkand and Bukhara.  \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n7 07-53011 \r\n \r\n The traditions of tolerance, goodness and respect \r\nfor other cultures and religions has formed the basis of \r\nthe national policy established in the years that have \r\nfollowed independence. These principles have been \r\nenshrined in the Constitution of the country, which \r\nemphasizes that all of its citizens have equal rights and \r\nfreedoms and are equal before the law, without \r\ndistinction on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, \r\nlanguage, religion, social origins or social status. \r\n Since the first days of Uzbekistan’s \r\nindependence, the President of Uzbekistan, Islam \r\nKarimov, has defined the issue of strengthening \r\ninterreligious and intercultural accord as one of the \r\npriorities of State policy. Because of this approach, \r\ntoday’s Uzbek society is a worthy example of cultural \r\npluralism and tolerance.  \r\n On the initiative on the head of our State, the year \r\n1992 saw the establishment of the Republican Inter-\r\nethnic Cultural Centre, which provides valuable \r\nassistance of all kinds to the activities of more than \r\n140 cultural centres representing the various ethnic \r\ngroups living in Uzbekistan today. The Centre does its \r\nutmost to contribute to their work of maintaining and \r\ndeveloping the unique traditions, customs and \r\nlanguages inherent in each ethnic group. \r\nRepresentatives of varying ethnic groups living in the \r\ncountry are contributing to the strengthening of the \r\nindependence of our State and constructing a \r\ndemocratic society. They are given every opportunity \r\nto develop their native language, culture, theatre and \r\nfine arts, folk art, customs and traditions. \r\n As delegates know, the intercultural dialogue has \r\nnot only an ethnic but also a religious dimension. In \r\nthis regard, strengthening interreligious harmony has a \r\nkey role to play in our common efforts to ensure \r\nharmony among the varying cultures in developing the \r\nculture of the world. In this context, I would note that \r\nsince the beginning of independence in Uzbekistan, \r\nreligion has been seen as a factor for forming people’s \r\nspiritual outlook on the basis of the principles of \r\nmorality and preserving the rich spiritual and moral \r\nlegacy of our people. Especially now, when humankind \r\nis going through a complex process of development, \r\nreligion has particular relevance in moral and spiritual \r\nterms, bringing together diverse peoples in their joint \r\nefforts against evil and violence. \r\n At present, Uzbekistan has representatives of \r\n16 religious faiths. There are more than 2,000 religious \r\norganizations operating, including Muslim, Christian, \r\nJewish, Buddhist and others. To interact with religious \r\norganizations and to provide them assistance in \r\ncarrying out their activities, and to jointly work out \r\nmeasures to promote interreligious and inter-ethnic \r\npeace and harmony, the Government of Uzbekistan has \r\nestablished a council on affairs of faith under the \r\nCommittee for Religious Affairs in Uzbekistan. This \r\nCouncil includes leaders of the Board of Muslims in \r\nUzbekistan, Tashkent and Central Asia, the Diocese of \r\nthe Russian Orthodox Church, representatives of the \r\nRoman Catholic Church, the Union of Churches of \r\nEvangelical Christian Baptists, the Centre of Churches \r\nof Christians of the Full Gospel, the Evangelical \r\nLutheran Church and the religious Jewish Society of \r\nTashkent. \r\n In the years since Uzbekistan’s independence, the \r\nfirst translations of the Koran into Uzbek were \r\npublished, as was the Hadith Collection of Al-Bukhari, \r\nthe Bible, the 16 books of the Old Testament and the \r\nentire New Testament, the history of the apostles and \r\nother religious literature. In late 2004, the Muslim \r\nleadership of Uzbekistan, along with the Republican \r\nSociety for the Blind, published the Holy Koran in \r\nbraille. I emphasize that Uzbekistan became the third \r\nState in the world to carry out this noble undertaking. \r\n I take this opportunity to note that, to the great \r\ncredit of Uzbekistan with respect to Islamic culture and \r\nscience and in terms of protecting monuments and \r\nfurther enriching the legacy of Islam, the Islamic \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \r\ndeclared Tashkent a world capital of Islamic culture for \r\n2007. The holding this year in Tashkent of international \r\nconferences called “Islam and Tolerance: the example \r\nof Uzbekistan”, “Uzbekistan’s contribution to the \r\ndevelopment of Islamic civilization”, is yet another \r\nsalient example of the constant and extensive attention \r\nUzbekistan devotes to the promotion of intercultural \r\nand interreligious cooperation. \r\n It is no secret that today in different corners of \r\nthe world there are, unfortunately, trends towards a \r\ngrowth of intercultural and interreligious intolerance. \r\nSuch trends could disrupt the process of promoting \r\nunderstanding between peoples and representatives of \r\ndifferent faiths and could set serious precedents in \r\nterms of escalation of interreligious confrontation and \r\nextremist undertakings. In this regard, the \r\nconsolidation of international efforts is increasingly \r\nrelevant, as is a joint and coordinated response to \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 8 \r\n \r\npressing challenges in the area of intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogue. Effective new steps are needed \r\nto preserve an atmosphere of tolerance in relations \r\nbetween peoples, religions and cultures, based on \r\nequality and mutual respect. \r\n For its part, the Republic of Uzbekistan firmly \r\ncondemns any manifestations of religious or ethnic \r\nintolerance, terrorism or extremism, as well as attempts \r\nto use religion to justify them. We are undertaking \r\nevery effort, nationally, regionally and globally, to \r\npromote interreligious and intercultural mutual \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for the cause of peace. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Liu Zhenmin, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of China. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nChina supports the convening of this High-level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace, initiated by \r\nthe delegations of Pakistan and the Philippines, during \r\nthe current session of the General Assembly. \r\n Religious and cultural diversity is a valuable \r\nasset of society and an important engine for human \r\ncreativity and progress. The ever-deepening \r\nglobalization process has further narrowed the distance \r\namong different religions and cultures. In the current \r\nworld, various religions and cultures present us with \r\ngreat opportunities to learn from each other, but they \r\nare also experiencing unprecedented conflict among \r\nthemselves. The evolution of human history has shown \r\nthat difference is the motivation and starting point for \r\ndialogue; equality is the prerequisite and basis for \r\nexchanges; and candid and pragmatic dialogue and \r\nexchange can help drive our efforts to maintain peace \r\nand promote development. \r\n The Chinese Government has always upheld the \r\nconcept of harmony in diversity. We encourage \r\ndialogue on the basis of equality and are opposed to \r\nextremism and the imposition of one’s own beliefs and \r\nvalues on others, as well as discrimination, prejudice \r\nand xenophobia based on religious, ethnic or other \r\ngrounds. In the current international situation, this \r\ndialogue on the theme of interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation is very \r\nrelevant and important. Promoting dialogue and \r\ncooperation among religions and cultures is conducive \r\nto enhancing mutual understanding and peaceful \r\ncoexistence among peoples of the world and is \r\nbeneficial to the global diversity and the common \r\nprogress of humankind. \r\n The evolution and development of Chinese \r\ncivilization over the past 5,000 years have proven that \r\nreligion and culture can play a positive role in \r\nharmonious development. The openness and \r\ninclusiveness of the Chinese culture have enabled \r\nvarious religions and cultures to flourish in China. \r\nFrom indigenous Taoism to imported Buddhism, Islam, \r\nChristianity and Catholicism, all major religions of the \r\nworld are able to coexist peacefully and to grow \r\nsteadily in China. While developing themselves, the \r\nfive religions have also enriched the Chinese culture. \r\n“Harmony is most precious; love should be \r\nuniversal” — these are the traditional concepts of \r\nChinese culture. China believes that if various religions \r\nand cultures avoid self-righteousness, subjectivity and \r\nprejudice and instead practice mutual tolerance and \r\nunderstanding, it is then possible to avoid \r\nconfrontation and conflict of a religious nature. \r\n The Chinese Government respects freedom of \r\nreligion and pursues a policy of independence in \r\nrunning religious affairs. According to incomplete \r\nstatistics, there are currently more than 100 million \r\nreligious believers in China, about 85,000 religious \r\nsites, 300,000 clergy, more than 3,000 religious groups \r\nand 74 religious schools to train clergy. \r\n China actively supports the participation of its \r\nreligious community in international cooperation and \r\nexchanges, as a way to increase mutual understanding \r\nand promote common development. Last June, the \r\nChinese Government hosted in Nanjing the third Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting Interfaith Dialogue. The Nanjing \r\nStatement on Interfaith Dialogue, adopted on that \r\noccasion, made proposals for the promotion of \r\ninterfaith dialogue. The Statement has been distributed \r\nas an official document at the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n In order to work towards the peaceful coexistence \r\nof different religions and cultures, the international \r\ncommunity should base its action on the following \r\nthree approaches. \r\n First, we must adopt the approach of “harmony in \r\ndiversity” in addressing international affairs. \r\n“Harmony in diversity” means being harmonious but \r\nnot homogeneous, different but not confrontational. \r\nThis approach will help us not only to maintain \r\nfriendly relations with our neighbours and resolve \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n9 07-53011 \r\n \r\nconflicts, but also to facilitate religious and cultural \r\ndialogue as part of our common effort to maintain \r\npeace and security.  \r\n Secondly, we must strengthen education and \r\npublic awareness. Respect for different religions and \r\ncultures should be incorporated into text books. There \r\nshould be cultural exchanges and cooperation in the \r\nfield of education, and efforts should be made to \r\nadvocate religious and cultural equality, tolerance, \r\nmutual respect and peaceful coexistence. \r\n Thirdly, we must enlist the aid of the media. The \r\nmedia bear a special responsibility in promoting \r\ntolerance, peace, fairness and harmony. We should \r\nencourage the media to play a positive role by \r\ndisseminating peace values common to all cultures and \r\nreligions and promoting harmony, understanding and \r\nmutual respect.  \r\n Actions speak louder than words. Engaging in \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue and \r\ncooperation has become a necessity universally \r\nrecognized by the international community. We have \r\nseen the emergence of various initiatives and \r\nmechanisms within the framework of the United \r\nNations. We hope that these initiatives and mechanisms \r\ncan complement each other and form a synergy so as to \r\nmake use of the platform offered by the United \r\nNations, where all ethnic groups, cultures and religions \r\nare represented, to construct a bridge of \r\ncommunication and cooperation with a view to \r\npromoting the common development of human society \r\nand building a harmonious world.  \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Kirsti Lintonen, chairperson of the \r\ndelegation of Finland.  \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): Finland fully associates \r\nitself with the statement made earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of Portugal on behalf of the European \r\nUnion.  \r\n As noted earlier by other speakers in this very \r\ninteresting discussion, there have been many calls and \r\ncries for dialogue over perceived civilizational, \r\ncultural, ethnic and religious boundaries in recent \r\nyears. Religion has again become both an important \r\nsource of identity and a political force. This \r\ndevelopment has been noted globally, as globalization \r\nhas resulted in national borders losing some of their \r\nearlier relevance in matters of culture and religion.  \r\n Since religious identity is increasingly forming \r\nthe basis for political action, it is clear that religious \r\ndiscourse and religious activities are fast becoming \r\nimportant arenas for negotiating all types of social \r\nissues. Consequently, debates over religion, including \r\npublic conflicts over religious themes, often reflect a \r\nreality outside the realm of religion. For example, \r\nmany of the recent controversies relating to religious \r\nissues involving people of immigrant origin cannot be \r\nunderstood unless the social situation of these \r\npopulations is taken into account. \r\n Dialogue focused on religion is always useful, \r\nbut it does not cure the illnesses of social reality, such \r\nas unemployment, feelings of unworthiness and \r\nmarginalization. Social problems can be changed not \r\nthrough discussion but through deeds. Exclusion and \r\nrepression never lead to sustainable solutions, reflected \r\nin tolerance, diversity and mutual respect. On the \r\ncontrary, exclusion and repression push those who are \r\ndenied a voice to uncompromisingly assert a distinct \r\nidentity or to resort to violence. \r\n Against this background, it is easier to see that \r\nsome of the challenges we face in building \r\nmulticultural and multireligious societies are not due to \r\ndifferences among religions as such. Instead, they are \r\nreflections of social problems that give rise to small \r\ngroups that seek to build an ideological foundation and \r\ngain support for their political cause. We must not \r\nallow these extreme views to overshadow those of the \r\nmajority and the mainstream.  \r\n The role of religious communities in defusing \r\nconflicts cannot be overemphasized. The faithful need \r\nto discuss respect for religious beliefs and freedom of \r\nexpression within their own communities in addition to \r\npursuing dialogue with other religious communities in \r\norder to develop a common understanding of religious \r\ntolerance. The situation demands self-reflection and \r\nadaptation to changed circumstances from everyone: \r\ncitizens, Governments and other actors, including \r\nreligious organizations and the media. \r\n We need to cross the threshold of suspicion and \r\ndistrust through mutual respect of the other and free \r\nourselves from prejudices in order to recognize the \r\ncommon values of holiness, humanity and peace \r\npresent in all cultural and religious traditions.  \r\n We need to counter the misuse of religious \r\nidentity and feelings for divisive ethnic and political \r\npurposes. Encounters free of political overtones and \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 10 \r\n \r\nagendas between authentic representatives of religious \r\ncommunities have revealed the potential for spiritual \r\ndiscourse in overcoming bitter historical and political \r\nmemories and prejudices.  \r\n All of us are encouraged by the multitude of \r\nlocal, regional and international initiatives and \r\nprocesses that promote intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue and understanding. However, this positive \r\ndevelopment makes coordination imperative.  \r\n Since 2006, the Alliance of Civilizations \r\ninitiative has put intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue firmly in a multilateral context and on the \r\nagenda of the United Nations. The Alliance has the \r\ngreat advantage of bringing together many threads \r\nemanating from other initiatives and processes in this \r\nfield. We would like to stress the need for concrete \r\nmeasures and the implementation of the Action Plan. \r\nAll of us need to step up our efforts in the areas of \r\neducation, youth, gender, migration and media.  \r\n For Finland, the Alliance of Civilizations is a key \r\nforum for the development and implementation of \r\nmeasures to prevent divisions from arising among \r\ndifferent populations, religions, cultures and \r\ncivilizations — a task that seems to be becoming more \r\nand more important in the entire world, Europe \r\nincluded. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohammed Al-Allaf, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Jordan. \r\n Mr. Al-Allaf (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Jordan \r\nwelcomes the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious \r\nand Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for \r\nPeace. We thank both Pakistan and the Philippines for \r\nthis initiative, which constitutes a promising beginning \r\nand foundation for intellectual contacts between \r\ncultures and religions.  \r\n The international community has reached a \r\ncrucial turning point: either we must resign ourselves \r\nto the situation of tension in the world and accept the \r\nconsequences of conflict and dispute, or we must \r\nappeal to reason and good sense by laying the \r\nfoundations of a positive and constructive dialogue that \r\nenhances the common denominators of various cultures \r\nand religions, placing them at the service of \r\nhumankind.  \r\n In recent years, we have seen a reduction in the \r\npower of the left in many parts of the world; that has \r\ngone hand in hand with a proliferation of political \r\ntrends that consider Islam to be an adversary. Islam is \r\nin no way an adversary. The political trends in the \r\nmedia and cultures that mobilize to promote that view \r\nare simply desperate and unrealistic, and in no way \r\nreflect the tolerance that is advocated by monotheistic \r\nreligions and world civilizations. We have the right to \r\nquestion the agendas of such schools of thought and \r\ntheir real hidden objectives.  \r\n Currently, over 20 prestigious academic \r\ninstitutions are organizing events that, although held at \r\na great distance from one another, share the topic of \r\nIslamic fascism. That is not just a spontaneous, \r\ninnocent, non-political and non-ideological approach; \r\nit is an organized, systematic and deliberate approach \r\nseeking to establish an imaginary link between Islam \r\nand violence. We would therefore wish to see today’s \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace become a \r\nhistoric option for people not just to enhance \r\ncommunication and understanding, but also to avoid \r\nthe trap of tension, conflict and war. \r\n The tensions, conflicts, closed-mindedness, \r\ndiscrimination and prejudice prevailing in today’s \r\nworld lead us to believe that the dialogue that we wish \r\nto achieve at this stage must be based on the principles \r\nof mutual respect, equality and the rejection of \r\nterrorism, extremism, racism and fanaticism of all \r\nkinds. The dialogue we seek is one that would \r\nreconcile and balance deep-rooted traditions and \r\nmodernity. Jordan wishes to send the message that \r\ndialogue and coexistence are the only options that will \r\novercome the current tensions arising from the \r\ndiversity of cultures and religions so that we can all \r\nlive in harmony in a climate of peace, security and \r\nstability. \r\n The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan believes in \r\nthe importance of reason and, through its Government, \r\nhas developed a message, known as the Amman \r\nMessage, of dialogue and communication at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. The \r\nMessage reveals the true face of Islam, a vector of \r\nnoble human values and principles; it seeks to absolve \r\nIslam of ignorant and biased thinking that links it to \r\nterrorism and violence and accuses it of fanaticism and \r\nprejudice. The message is all the more important in \r\nproviding for a series of practical agreed measures \r\nbetween clerics from Muslim countries and the \r\nspiritual leaders of the various Muslim sects with \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n11 07-53011 \r\n \r\nrespect to combating extremist thought and takfiri \r\nthinking, whereby some Muslims charge others with \r\nunbelief; eliminating violence; and promoting \r\ntolerance and acceptance of others by clearly \r\nidentifying those who are authorized to issue Islamic \r\nfatwa. That will help to reduce political, religious and \r\nintellectual tensions and to mobilize local and \r\ninternational public opinion on the tolerance that is a \r\nfeature of Islam, contributing to the understanding of \r\nIslam as a partner and not as an adversary. \r\n Moreover, the Governments of Jordan and Spain \r\nhave reached an agreement on the Amman statement of \r\n24 April 2006. In the context of the statement, a \r\nworking group comprised of prominent representatives \r\nof civil society has been established to identify \r\npractical means to promote respect and understanding \r\nbetween the West and the Arab and Muslim worlds. In \r\nthe Euro-Mediterranean context, an institute for \r\ndialogue among cultures has been established to \r\ndemonstrate that dialogue between partners has \r\nunlimited possibilities. \r\n Jordan believes that the United Nations is still the \r\nideal forum for discussing these issues. The United \r\nNations brings us together, despite our differences. \r\nJordan therefore welcomes the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations initiative and the upcoming convening of \r\nits first annual meeting in Madrid on 15 and 16 January \r\n2008. The meeting will be a great opportunity to \r\nexchange opinions and views among civil societies, \r\nacademic circles and the private sector, and will enable \r\nthe adoption of practical measures to promote dialogue \r\namong the members of the Alliance.  \r\n In conclusion, modern civilizations have found \r\nthemselves in a deplorable isolation from the world \r\nand from one another. The world, meanwhile, has \r\nachieved its greatest successes through cooperation \r\nexchange and communication on all fronts — \r\ntechnological, scientific, and arts and literature. Let us \r\ntherefore work together to check this destructive \r\nacceleration of conflict and build instead an edifice of \r\nhope and confidence in the future. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Henry MacDonald, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Suriname. \r\n Mr. Macdonald (Suriname): I commend the \r\ninitiative of organizing this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace in order to advance the values of \r\nmutual understanding and tolerance. \r\n In that regard, I am privileged to present \r\nSuriname as a model of successful interreligious and \r\nintercultural collaboration. Let me start by informing \r\nthe General Assembly that Surinamese society is multi-\r\nethnic, multicultural, multilinguistic and \r\nmultireligious. The make-up of Suriname’s population \r\ncomprises approximately 10 main ethnic groups and at \r\nleast as many mixed types originating from its colonial \r\npast. We have an ethnic composition that is very \r\ndiverse, consisting of descendants from all corners of \r\nthe world, including the native Amerindians; \r\nEuropeans; African maroons and creoles; Asians from \r\nIndia, Java and China; people from the Middle-East, \r\nincluding Lebanese, Syrians and Jews; and other \r\ngroups. In addition to the aforementioned, we practice \r\ndifferent types of religion: Christianity, Hinduism, \r\nIslam, Buddhism, Baha’i and shamanism. \r\n As a result, different languages are spoken in \r\nSurinamese society, which also contributes to our rich \r\nand colourful culture, expressed through many \r\ndifferent folkloric and cultural traditions, such as \r\nrituals and ceremonies, arts and crafts, music and \r\nperformance, cultural dances and, most importantly, a \r\ndiversified cuisine. It is this colourful diversity of \r\ncultures and cultural expressions and the harmonious \r\nrelationships between groups which makes a profound \r\nimpression on foreigners visiting the country. \r\n The acceptance of and appreciation for each \r\nindividual group for the different cultural expressions \r\nof the others is extraordinary. What is noticeable is that \r\nall these ethnic groups with different cultural \r\nbackgrounds and traditions coexist and cooperate \r\npeacefully with each other. This is reflected in the \r\npolitical representation in the Administration. Growing \r\nup in such a society teaches one to respect values and \r\ntraditions from different groups existing and living \r\ntogether in harmony and peace. \r\n All of that does not mean that everything is \r\nperfect. We have our differences. However, the \r\nconstitution of Suriname guarantees that “no one shall \r\nbe discriminated against on the grounds of birth, sex, \r\nrace, language, religious origin, education, political \r\nbeliefs, economic position or any other status”, and \r\nthat “everyone has the right of freedom of religion and \r\nphilosophy of life”. \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 12 \r\n \r\n The Government respects those rights in practice \r\nand seeks to protect them at all levels, and it does not \r\ntolerate any form of their abuse, either by \r\nGovernmental or by private actors. The Government, \r\nconsequently, does not establish requirements for \r\nrecognition of religious faiths. On the contrary, \r\nGovernmental policy and practice contribute to the free \r\npractice of religion. The amicable common relationship \r\namong religious groups in our society contributes to \r\nreligious freedom. Most citizens, particularly those \r\nliving in Paramaribo, our capital district, celebrate, to \r\nvarying degrees, the religious holidays of other groups.  \r\n Since 1989, the Inter-Religious Council in \r\nSuriname has been the venue for consultation and \r\ndialogue among the main religions in the country. The \r\nCouncil is composed of the principal representatives of \r\nthose religions. Council members meet at least twice \r\neach month to discuss planned ecumenical activities \r\nand their position on Governmental policies when \r\nnecessary. It is noteworthy that, in the past, this \r\ninstitution has been instrumental in bringing about \r\nsolutions to major national political impasses. \r\n On the regional level, the Inter-Religious Council \r\nin Suriname cooperates with its Caribbean counterparts \r\nwith the aim of discussing regional and global issues. \r\nIn situations of cultural and religious pluralism, it is \r\nincreasingly apparent that mutual understanding and \r\nrespect for differences play a vital role in maintaining \r\nthe unity necessary for genuine progress and for \r\nensuring that the spectre of interreligious or \r\ninter-ethnic conflict does not haunt us. \r\n At the international level, peaceful coexistence of \r\ndifferent values and cultures remains a challenge. We \r\ntherefore continue to support and promote dialogue \r\namong civilizations and remain convinced that a \r\nculture of peace and understanding can be significantly \r\nenhanced through this kind of dialogue in order to \r\npromote mutual understanding, respect and tolerance \r\namong religions, cultures and peoples all over the \r\nworld. Let us be mindful of the fact that dialogue \r\namong civilizations, cultures and religions is an \r\neffective remedy to prevent conflicts on national, \r\nregional and international levels. We are therefore \r\nlooking forward to further enhancing the aims of \r\ninterfaith dialogue when Cambodia hosts the next such \r\ndialogue in 2008. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Takahiro Shinyo, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Japan. \r\n Mr. Shinyo (Japan): Last year, in its resolution \r\n61/221, the General Assembly said it was alarmed that \r\nserious instances of intolerance and discrimination on \r\nthe grounds of religion or belief, including acts of \r\nviolence, intimidation and coercion motivated by \r\nreligious intolerance, were on the increase in many \r\nparts of the world and threatened the enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. The \r\nAssembly went on to emphasize the need for \r\nstrengthening respect for diversity of culture and \r\nreligion or belief, dialogue and understanding as the \r\nway to end discrimination and violence based on \r\nreligious and other differences. \r\n One year earlier, in 2005, the Declaration issued \r\nat the conclusion of the Bali Interfaith Dialogue, held \r\nwithin the framework of the Asia-Europe Meeting \r\n(ASEM), expressed similar concern, and we therefore \r\nneed to keep this statement in mind as well, especially \r\nthe resolve of its signatories in the areas of education, \r\nculture, media, religion and society. \r\n I believe this High-level Dialogue provides us \r\nwith an important opportunity to advance the goals of \r\nthe Bali Declaration and General Assembly resolution \r\n61/221, and I am pleased to be able to participate in it. \r\n It is the view of Japan that interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue contributes to mutual \r\nunderstanding, and that it not only resolves existing \r\nconflicts but also helps to prevent new conflicts from \r\narising. To enhance mutual understanding, education is \r\nclearly of critical importance. We simply must convey \r\nto our people at all levels, including the national and \r\nregional levels, that there are many religions and \r\ncultures in the world other than our own and that \r\ntolerance for them is essential if we are to secure for \r\npeople everywhere the enjoyment of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. \r\n Also important for the promotion of interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue are the activities of the \r\nprivate sector, including non-governmental \r\norganizations, and those of local authorities. All \r\nMember States should likewise heed the messages \r\ndelivered by representatives of religious groups at the \r\nInformal Meeting of Leaders on Interfaith Dialogue \r\nand Cooperation for Peace and at this High-level \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n13 07-53011 \r\n \r\nDialogue. Greater understanding is necessary at both \r\nthe community and national levels. \r\n I would like also to briefly describe the steps \r\nJapan is taking in this area. Japan has made a positive \r\ncommitment to the dialogue among civilizations that \r\nUNESCO is leading. In 2001, at the United Nations \r\nUniversity in Tokyo, we hosted the international \r\nseminar on education and the protection of cultural \r\nheritage in South-Eastern Europe. This was a \r\ndiscussion about how education can help make people \r\nunderstand other nationalities and cultures. \r\nParticipants, in addition to South-Eastern European \r\ncountries themselves, included UNESCO, UNICEF and \r\nthe Council of Europe. \r\n In 2005, Japan hosted the World Civilization \r\nForum 2005 in Tokyo. Japan was one of the co-chairs \r\nof the counter-terrorism meeting of the Regional \r\nForum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN), held in Singapore in May 2007, and \r\ncontributed to the first discussion there on \r\nintercivilization dialogue. Last July, Japan became a \r\nmember of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. Last May, the fifth ASEM Conference on \r\nCounter-Terrorism was held in Japan; participants \r\nemphasized the need to engage in intercultural, \r\ninterreligious and intercivilizational dialogue on the \r\nfight against terrorism.  \r\n To date, in addition to the World Civilization \r\nForum I mentioned earlier, we have hosted the Seminar \r\nfor Intercivilizational Dialogue with the Islamic World \r\nfive times, dispatched an exchange and dialogue \r\nmission to the Middle East three times, and invited \r\npeople involved in Islamic boarding schools in \r\nIndonesia to visit and speak with people in Japan. \r\nThus, we have made continuing and varied efforts to \r\npromote intercultural and intercivilizational dialogue. \r\n Before concluding, I would like to say just a few \r\nwords about human security, which is what a society \r\nachieves when its people are free from fear and \r\nscarcity and are able to live their lives with dignity. \r\nThat is to say, it is the idea and goal of the protection \r\nand empowerment of each person. \r\n Japan believes that the idea of human security has \r\nmuch in common with the purpose of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, which is the satisfaction of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. We are \r\ntherefore convinced that such dialogue can and should \r\nbe advanced through the pursuit of human security. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Claudia Blum, chairperson of the \r\ndelegation of Colombia. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation welcomes the decision of the Assembly to \r\nconvene the first formal High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace. In particular, we commend the \r\nPhilippines and Pakistan for their leadership in that \r\ninitiative. \r\n Colombia, as a multi-ethnic, multilingual and \r\nmulticultural nation, assigns great significance to \r\nculture, diversity, intercultural peaceful understanding \r\nand intercultural dialogue in the advancement of \r\nsocieties. \r\n Cultural diversity is an asset and a fundamental \r\nvalue of humankind that must encourage the \r\nformulation of effective solutions to address national, \r\nregional and global challenges. In the context of \r\nglobalization, which has had important benefits and \r\nsimultaneously poses significant challenges, \r\nintercultural dialogue between civilizations is of \r\nincreasing relevance. It is a significant objective at a \r\ntime when stereotypes and inappropriate arguments are \r\nproliferating, inciting confrontation between \r\ncivilizations with respect to issues relative to welfare, \r\narmed conflict, terrorism, human rights and migration, \r\namong others. Intercultural dialogue is necessary to \r\npromote attitudes that counter such stereotypes and to \r\ncontribute to the creation of conditions conducive to \r\npeaceful coexistence. \r\n My delegation would like to submit some \r\nconsiderations on recommendable actions related to the \r\nsubject before us today. \r\n At the national level, States must promote and \r\nprotect their own cultural identity and diversity, while \r\nencouraging social respect for cultural diversity at the \r\ninternational level. In that respect, legislative and \r\npolitical actions are recommended in order to \r\nguarantee and promote respect for cultural rights, to \r\npromote and preserve the local and world heritage, and \r\nto support artistic expression. \r\n Furthermore, greater importance must be attached \r\nto legal and political measures taken to protect and \r\npromote the rights of national ethnic, cultural, religious \r\nand linguistic groups and minorities. It is also \r\nimportant to guarantee the rights of migrants, who are \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 14 \r\n \r\nsubject in diverse contexts to xenophobia and other \r\ndiscriminatory practices based on culture, religion, \r\nlanguage or nationality. \r\n Dialogue must be promoted not only among \r\ngovernmental or political actors. The promotion of \r\nmessages of understanding of and esteem for cultural \r\ndiversity is also the responsibility of social, economic, \r\nacademic and artistic leaders, representing influential \r\nsectors within societies. Changing attitudes begins at \r\nthe community and even at the family levels. \r\n Religion is an integral dimension of cultural \r\ndiversity. UNESCO has recognized that. The \r\nColombian Constitution recognizes the right to \r\nfreedom of religion and the freedom of all, either \r\nindividually or in community, to practice their religion \r\nor beliefs. Furthermore, our Constitution establishes \r\nequality of faiths under the law. Colombia considers \r\nthat interreligious dialogue and the full guarantee of \r\nrights related to religion are also essential to counteract \r\nirrational expressions that use religion as a way of \r\njustifying confrontation. \r\n The mass media can also contribute to promoting \r\nunderstanding and peaceful coexistence. It is \r\nappropriate for media from all regions of the world to \r\nestablish, on a voluntary and autonomous basis, \r\npermanent spaces to analyse and deepen their function \r\nin the peaceful interaction of civilizations, taking every \r\npolitical, social and economic context into account. In \r\nany case, to that end freedom of information and \r\nexpression cannot be restricted in any form that \r\ntransgresses international human rights instruments. \r\nFreedom of information and expression is an essential \r\nfoundation of democratic systems and coexistence. \r\n Child and youth education is another essential \r\naspect. It is critical to create the capacity for analysis \r\nin children and youth, and to promote their \r\nunderstanding of the value of cultural pluralism and \r\nrespect for differences. Promoting such values is no \r\nthreat to the consolidation of national culture. On the \r\ncontrary, awareness of the intrinsic richness of \r\ndiversity implies greater recognition of and regard for \r\none’s own cultural identity, while avoiding belligerent \r\nattitudes. \r\n At the multilateral level, my delegation feels that \r\na cooperative approach among nations must exist. Such \r\nan approach should be based on respect for a nation’s \r\nidentity and for existing international obligations, and \r\nascribe value to the cultural diversity and \r\nparticularities of human groups as a collective asset. It \r\nmust promote dialogue over the confrontation, \r\npoliticization or irrational obstacles to cultural \r\ndiversity that persist in certain spheres. \r\n Given the reality of a world exposed to \r\nirresponsible expressions of cultural conflict, the \r\nUnited Nations can deepen the analysis, formulation \r\nand implementation of actions that enable such \r\ndestructive trends to be prevented and reversed. In that \r\nrespect, Colombia recognizes the role of such \r\ninitiatives as the Alliance of Civilizations and such \r\norganizations as UNESCO. It is important for actions \r\nto be coordinated and to have clear focal points in \r\norder to avoid the dispersal of effort. \r\n With such an approach, the United Nations can \r\ncontribute to counteracting extreme positions that seek \r\nto justify violence and disrespect among individuals \r\nand peoples. Both in dialogue among States and in the \r\nwork of entities of the United Nations system, a \r\nrespectful, open and constructive view of the historical \r\ndifferences and cultural diversity of human societies is \r\nfundamental for the achievement of consensus, in the \r\ncertainty that such diversity is not an obstacle to the \r\nfull accomplishment of this Organization’s principles \r\nand purposes and of the universal values of \r\ninternational peaceful coexistence, and with the vision \r\nthat such diversity is one of the factors that drives the \r\ndevelopment of nations. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sirodjidin Aslov, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Tajikistan. \r\n Mr. Aslov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of my delegation, I would like to extend to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly my sincere \r\nappreciation for organizing today’s Dialogue. The \r\ntheme of this Dialogue is an urgent issue for my \r\ncountry and for the entire region. \r\n Some nine years ago, when the Assembly decided \r\nto proclaim the United Nations Year of Dialogue \r\nAmong Civilizations, we held the view that cultural \r\nand religious diversity was not a threat but an asset and \r\na major driving force for humankind’s progress. Such \r\ndiversity is the source and inspiration for dialogue \r\nbased on mutual tolerance and respect. Since that time, \r\nnumerous events have been held with the aim of \r\nfostering mutual understanding, trust, tolerance and \r\nrespect. \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n15 07-53011 \r\n \r\n Regrettably, however, we have to note that what \r\nwe witness in today’s world is a lack of tolerance and \r\never-increasing alienation. We are certain that once we \r\nfully realize that cultural and religious diversity is a \r\nsource of strength, rather than a cause for \r\ndisagreement, our dialogue will become stable and \r\nlong-term. We believe that such a dialogue will take \r\nplace only once we recognize that we are living in a \r\nworld of diversity, but that we share common values. \r\n In Tajikistan, a culture of tolerance and respect \r\nhas been shaped over several thousand years marked \r\nby interaction among diverse cultures and religions. \r\nToday, these values are codified in the principal law of \r\nour country, the constitution. Article 26 of the \r\nconstitution, in particular, states that each citizen has \r\nthe right to determine his or her religious preference \r\nand participate in religious ceremonies. In Tajikistan \r\ntoday, representatives of many confessions such as \r\nChristianity — including Orthodoxy and \r\nLutheranism — Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, the Baha’i \r\nfaith, Krishnaism and others freely observe their \r\nreligious traditions and participate in religious \r\nceremonies.  \r\n Last year, Tajikistan, together with other States, \r\nsponsored General Assembly resolution 61/221. \r\nTajikistan is a party to the Interfaith Dialogue and \r\nCooperation for Peace initiative, whose second \r\nministerial meeting was held in New York recently. In \r\nthis connection, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nreiterate the need to enhance the activities of the \r\nSecretariat focal point appointed in accordance with \r\nthat General Assembly resolution. \r\n This is a time of unified efforts and common \r\naspirations to address the major challenges facing \r\nhumankind. Mutually advantageous international \r\ncooperation is thus becoming an imperative if we are to \r\nreduce and prevent new global threats and dangers, \r\nsuch as terrorism, extremism, illicit drug trafficking \r\nand transnational organized crime. Current trends \r\ntowards nationalism and extremism, as well as the risk \r\nof military conflict, require us to expand and promote \r\nintercultural and interfaith dialogue at the regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n No party to international relations should remain \r\nindifferent to such issues. For this reason, searching for \r\nnew modes of cooperation and integration for regions \r\nand countries, developing the dialogue of civilizations, \r\nsafeguarding peace, establishing an environment of \r\ntrust and renouncing ethnic and religious confrontation \r\namong diverse cultures should become the primary \r\nfocus of our dialogue. \r\n Currently, my country is hosting a meeting of \r\nleaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, \r\nthe Eurasian Economic Community and the \r\nOrganization of the Treaty on Collective Security. \r\nThose organizations, in cooperation with the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization and the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, are not only considering and \r\nimplementing a variety of treaties and agreements on \r\neconomic, social and security issues but are also \r\ndevoting special attention to cooperation in culture, \r\nscience, education, health care and other areas. We \r\nbelieve that further development of cooperation among \r\nthose organizations also promotes the formation of a \r\nunified social and cultural realm, which can sustain \r\ncultural diversity and dialogue among cultures and \r\nreligions. It has already become a tradition for \r\nTajikistan and friendly States to exchange culture days. \r\nBy organizing such events, we not only strengthen \r\nfriendship among our peoples but also foster \r\nintercultural and interfaith dialogue. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to highlight that \r\ndialogue is also important for another goal that is vital \r\nto humankind: achieving development. Through the \r\nexchange of experience and the joint search for \r\nsolutions, we will be able to deal with today’s and \r\ntomorrow’s social and economic issues of common \r\nconcern. Here, it is essential to ensure continued \r\ndialogue at all levels, from local to national, regional \r\nand international, with the broad participation of \r\nwomen and young people. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bashar Ja’afari, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Syrian Arab Republic. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I am pleased to address the General Assembly, \r\nthis important international forum, to discuss a highly \r\nimportant matter which for years has been the object of \r\nconsideration by thinkers worldwide: the culture of \r\npeace and the centrality of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace. \r\n On 10 and 11 May 2007, at the initiative of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, the Assembly convened an informal thematic \r\ndebate entitled “Civilizations and the challenge for \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 16 \r\n \r\npeace: Obstacles and opportunities”. That debate is \r\nrelevant to the matter under discussion here today. It \r\nculminated in our current High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace, whose aim is to encourage \r\ntolerance, international understanding and respect for \r\nreligions, faiths and cultural diversity. The two \r\norganizers of this High-level Dialogue — the \r\ndelegations of Pakistan and the Philippines — have \r\npainstakingly prepared this Dialogue by focusing it on \r\nthe challenges, best practices and strategies for \r\ncooperation among religions and cultures in today’s \r\nworld. Perhaps these matters accurately encapsulate the \r\nissues and problems faced by the international \r\ncommunity with regard to interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation for peace. \r\nBuilding bridges of interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding and cooperation will definitely help to \r\nsupport peace in the world, disseminate a culture of \r\npeace in societies and will narrow the gap of \r\nmisunderstanding and ignorance among peoples. It will \r\nalso lighten the burden of prejudice and subjectivity \r\nborn of intellectual extremism in a world that is not \r\nfree from ideological and political complexities. \r\n In that connection, it is important for enlightened \r\npeople worldwide to hasten to advance interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue, according priority to \r\nintellectual exchange and respect for the identity of the \r\nother, and not to mix religion and politics.  \r\n The issue of demonizing the other to spawn \r\ndivisiveness, threats or conflict must be addressed \r\nduring the present Dialogue, which is being held under \r\nGeneral Assembly auspices. We must ensure the \r\ntransparency and objectivity and political neutrality of \r\nthe dialogue and thus the acceptability of its results. \r\nWe believe that any serious dialogue designed to \r\nconsolidate interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace should not be \r\nunilateral or limited to selectively fostering ties of \r\nunderstanding and cooperation between specific \r\nreligions or cultures at the expense of inclusive \r\ninterreligious and intercultural understanding and \r\ncooperation for peace. \r\n In that regard, we must understand that the lack \r\nof understanding among human beings is based on \r\nmisunderstanding of religions and cultures, and not on \r\nstructural shortcomings in these lofty ethical concepts. \r\nHuman history shows that consummate and elegant \r\nmodels of intercultural understanding and cooperation \r\narose during ancient times when intellectual and \r\nmilitary clashes were rampant. Yet in recent decades, \r\nthe international community has witnessed violent \r\nclashes and a lack of dialogue and understanding, \r\nwhile at the same time, some vaunt intellectual \r\nphenomena such as globalization and the \r\ncommunications and information revolution. \r\n The twentieth century was the most violent in \r\nhuman history, although it also witnessed \r\nunprecedented scientific progress and advances in \r\nhuman communications. During the twentieth century, \r\ntwo world wars erupted and took the lives of millions \r\nof human beings. The same century saw the most \r\nviolent colonial injustices against African, Asian and \r\nLatin American cultures that date back to the beginning \r\nof time. That century also witnessed the first use of \r\nnuclear weapons by man against man.  \r\n At the beginning of the twenty-first century we \r\nare witnessing radical forms of human violence in \r\nmore than one place in the world, as if there were a \r\nreturn in the thinking of political decision makers to a \r\nconcept of human relations based on violent clashes \r\namong many sovereign States. We had hoped that such \r\nreactionary thinking had ended once and for all.  \r\n It is saddening that the international community \r\nis forced to hold a dialogue on interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation for peace \r\nat a time of globalization and the information \r\nrevolution: an age that presupposes that human beings \r\nare no longer ignorant of or indifferent to one another.  \r\n Is it conceivable that such a significant matter \r\nshould not be on the agenda of hundreds of prestigious \r\nintellectual and religious institutions and universities? \r\nIs it conceivable that in the twenty-first century we \r\nshould still be seeking best practices and strategies for \r\ninterreligious and intercultural cooperation? Is that \r\nattributable to massive human ignorance over the \r\ncenturies?  \r\n Responding to these challenges requires a \r\ncomprehensive intellectual revolution against all forms \r\nof intellectual isolation and all preconceived ideas. The \r\nresponse rests on promoting cultural discourse, \r\naugmenting contacts and communication, bridging the \r\ngap of misunderstanding and settling international \r\ndisputes justly and equitably while remaining \r\ncommitted to the elimination of injustice and to putting \r\nan end to foreign occupation everywhere and to using \r\nreligion politically for expansionist and settlement \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n17 07-53011 \r\n \r\npurposes, while ignoring the rights of others and their \r\ncultural and holy sites. \r\n In conclusion, my country supports the proposal \r\nsubmitted by the Philippines and Pakistan to establish a \r\nnew focal point in the United Nations. My delegation \r\nconcurs with the November 2006 report of the High-\r\nlevel Group on the Alliance of Civilizations established \r\nby the Secretary-General, and the important political \r\nviews it sets out, relating in particular to an end to the \r\nIsraeli occupation of the Arab territories and a just \r\nsettlement of the Palestinian question. \r\n The Acting President: Before giving the floor to \r\nthe next speaker, I would like to inform members that \r\nthere are still 21 speakers remaining to be heard. I \r\nwould therefore again appeal to members to make their \r\nstatements as concise as possible by summarizing the \r\nstatements and circulating the full texts. \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Habib \r\nMansour, chairman of the delegation of Tunisia. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, let me say how proud and pleased we are to \r\ntake part in today’s meeting on a theme which is of \r\ngreat importance to Tunisia, given that the rapid and \r\nprofound changes under way worldwide have led to \r\nchallenges that are difficult to ignore or disregard. The \r\nquestion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue \r\nclearly falls within that framework. \r\n I would be remiss if I did not express our \r\nappreciation and gratitude to the Government of \r\nPakistan and the Government of the Philippines for \r\nhaving taken this important initiative and for their \r\nefforts to organize this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace.  \r\n Tunisia attaches great importance to the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General on interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace (A/62/337) and the report of the Director-\r\nGeneral of UNESCO on the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of \r\nthe World, 2001-2010 (A/62/97). Here, my delegation \r\nwould like to thank that organization for its \r\nconstructive efforts on behalf of children. We are \r\ncertain too that UNESCO will play a valuable role in \r\nthe implementation of the recommendations in those \r\nreports. \r\n Interreligious and intercultural dialogue is among \r\nthe core themes in the recommendations set out in the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). \r\nIndeed, heads of State or Government underscored \r\nenhanced cultural relations among peoples and nations \r\nas the only way to foster understanding and harmony \r\nand to counter extremism. That approach will \r\nguarantee just and lasting peace among all peoples. \r\nTunisia’s cultural policies are in total harmony with the \r\nWorld Summit recommendations. In that context, \r\nTunisia is eager to disseminate the values of peace, \r\ntolerance and dialogue among the peoples and \r\ncivilizations with which our country has interacted. \r\nBased on those principles, my country attaches great \r\nimportance to national policies and measures to \r\npreserve our national identity to ensure understanding \r\namong peoples, openness to and positive and effective \r\ninteraction with others. That approach to society is \r\nfounded on reconciling our genuine interaction with \r\nmodernity on the one hand with preservation and \r\nconsolidation of our national identity on the other. One \r\nTunisian option has been to solidify the pillars of our \r\nnational culture, which are firmly based on Islam and \r\nits values of tolerance. \r\n For that reason, the President of the Republic has \r\nestablished a university chair in dialogue among \r\ncivilizations and religions, with a view to providing an \r\nintellectual space conducive to dialogue. Furthermore, \r\nthe President has instituted the International \r\nPresidential Award on Islamic Studies and has \r\nundertaken efforts to promote values such as \r\nmoderation, tolerance, solidarity and openness. These \r\ninitiatives give form to the contribution that Tunisia \r\ncan make, thanks to its glorious history, to enriching \r\nthe culture of humanism and spreading universal \r\nvalues and principles that are the common heritage of \r\nall peoples, despite their uniqueness. \r\n Our university chair in dialogue was established \r\nto strengthen the foundations of peace and \r\ndevelopment, and as part of a series of other similar \r\ninitiatives including the 1995 Carthage Charter on \r\nTolerance in the Mediterranean, which calls for \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue for tolerance \r\nand human rights. Another Tunisian initiative was the \r\nestablishment of the World Solidarity Fund to counter \r\npoverty, which the Assembly endorsed in its resolution \r\n57/265 of 20 December 2002, thus backing our \r\napproach to the fight against poverty and \r\nmarginalization as factors creating tension worldwide.  \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 18 \r\n \r\n In pursuance of the General Assembly’s 2001 \r\nproclamation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations (resolution 56/6), Tunisia has \r\nhosted a seminar on dialogue among civilizations. \r\nThere, my Government reiterated its appeal to build a \r\nnew world free of hatred and antagonism and called for \r\ntolerance and dialogue. Tunisia has also hosted a \r\nnumber of meetings and events for experts, such as the \r\nseminars organized together with the Islamic \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on \r\nthe theme “Human civilizations and cultures: from \r\ndialogue to alliance”. Tunisia has repeatedly reaffirmed \r\nthat dialogue among civilizations is one of the core \r\nprinciples that can curb trends towards violence and \r\nterrorism and that can lay the basis for dialogue and \r\ncooperation for world peace, security and prosperity. \r\n Based on those principles and conclusions, my \r\ndelegation supports all initiatives to buttress this \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue. We are certain \r\nthat this dialogue is the best way to protect humankind \r\nand its common values from the dangers posed by \r\nintolerance, closed-mindedness, extremism, \r\nmarginalization and terrorism. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Daniel Vigny, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Switzerland. \r\n Mr. Vigny (Switzerland) (spoke in French): We \r\nthank the Philippines and Pakistan for having worked \r\nto convene this meeting. We would also like to thank \r\nthe Secretariat and the representatives of civil society \r\nfor the excellent preparation of this High-level \r\nDialogue. \r\n As a meeting point of diverse cultures and \r\nreligions, Switzerland has had to learn peaceful \r\ncoexistence within the confines of a small territory. It \r\nhad to forge national unity transcending faiths, \r\nlanguages and economic interests. In the course of our \r\nhistory, religions have on occasion clashed violently. \r\nHowever, thanks to a shared determination to focus on \r\nwhat unites us on a practical level rather than on what \r\nseparate us ideologically, we succeeded in ending these \r\ntensions a century and a half ago. \r\n Switzerland has integrated this lesson of history \r\ninto its policy of promoting peace. Dialogue on values \r\ndoes not by itself build trust; indeed, it can sometime \r\neven accentuate differences. To move forward together, \r\ntherefore, it is essential to focus on solving specific \r\nproblems and to find practical solutions with the \r\nparties concerned. This is why, in the context of its \r\npolicy of promoting peace, Switzerland supports \r\nprojects that aim to define concrete ways for \r\ncommunities or groups with different values and \r\nconcepts to live together. However, Switzerland does \r\nnot support intercultural or interreligious dialogues \r\nexclusively on abstract values or doctrinal truths. \r\n Consequently, we fully support the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations initiative, which takes account of the \r\npolitical dimension of interreligious and intercultural \r\ntensions and aims to find practical solutions to such \r\ndisputes. My country therefore reaffirms its full \r\nsupport for the High Representative Jorge Sampaio in \r\nattaining the objectives of the Alliance of Civilizations. \r\n Ensuring respect for religious and cultural \r\ndiversity is not only a simple question of political will. \r\nIt is part of the far broader question of the proper \r\nfunctioning of the rule of law and the principles \r\ngoverning it: non-discrimination, freedom of \r\nexpression, freedom of thought and freedom of religion \r\nor belief. It is important that we reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to those rights. We are concerned about an \r\nincreasing risk of stereotyping religions and beliefs and \r\na lack of understanding for the values and practices of \r\nother religions or beliefs. We are alarmed by growing \r\nreligious intolerance and discrimination based on \r\nreligion or belief. Religious intolerance is a worldwide \r\nproblem and is not limited to certain religions and \r\nbeliefs. Followers of all religions and beliefs, as well \r\nas non-believers, are victims of human rights \r\nviolations. \r\n Freedom of religion or belief is a multifaceted \r\nright. The many aspects of this fundamental human are \r\nguaranteed by various international legal instruments. \r\nDiscrimination based on race, colour, sex, language, \r\nreligion, political or other opinion, national or social \r\norigin, property, birth or other status falls within the \r\nscope of human rights legislation. In addition, it has to \r\nbe stressed that the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights forbids any form of incitement to \r\nreligious hatred. \r\n Switzerland is firmly convinced that it is not \r\nreligion as such which has to be protected, but the non-\r\ndiscriminatory exercise — individually or as a member \r\nof a group — of all human rights, including the right to \r\nfreedom of religion or belief. We are convinced that we \r\ncan successfully combat discrimination if we agree to \r\napproach the issue under the umbrella of religious \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n19 07-53011 \r\n \r\ndiscrimination rather than in the context of defamation \r\nof religion.  \r\n The concept of defamation of religions is not \r\nappropriate in a human rights context, since it is \r\nindividuals, both believers and non-believers alike, \r\nwho have rights — and, to some extent, the \r\ncommunities to which they belong — not religions or \r\nbeliefs as such. As the Special Rapporteur on freedom \r\nof religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, outlined in a \r\nrecent report, the lack of an objective definition of the \r\nterm “defamation of religion” makes the whole concept \r\nopen to abuse. Due to the wide diversity of religions \r\nand beliefs, it is natural that genuine differences of \r\nopinion exist. Furthermore, it would be difficult and \r\npotentially dangerous to define in abstracto what \r\nconstitutes defamation of religion or even to find an \r\nimpartial and independent body for adjudicating such a \r\ncase. \r\n Switzerland is convinced that tolerance and \r\nmutual respect are essential to overcome differences in \r\nperceptions, concepts and ideas. Once again it is only \r\nby a constructive and respectful dialogue that we will \r\ntruly overcome our divergences in opinion in order to \r\npromote mutual understanding and surmount these \r\nchallenges successfully. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ivan Romero-Martínez, chairman \r\nof the delegation of Honduras.  \r\n Mr. Romero-Martínez (Honduras) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My country, Honduras, very much welcomes \r\nthe opportunity to participate in this High-level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace. We are of \r\nthe view that this is one of the most pertinent subjects \r\ntoday and that it is of particular importance to \r\nhumankind.  \r\n Universal respect for human thinking is as sacred \r\nas freedom itself: freedom of action, freedom of \r\nreligion and political freedom. Thus, in participating in \r\nthis important debate, we base our approach on the \r\nbelief that one of the unifying forces of mankind is \r\nfreedom. It prepares us for a permanent readiness to \r\ninteract with diversity and for tolerance, ongoing and \r\nrespectful dialogue, and a culture of peace among \r\nindividuals with diverse outlooks and visions. It \r\nprompts us to create a culture of peace and not a \r\nculture of war. Therefore, we support all the \r\nendeavours in which this Organization and its bodies \r\nare engaged.  \r\n We support the reports and recommendations of \r\nthe Secretary-General, and we support above all else \r\nthe efforts that help us to combat fanaticism, \r\nintolerance and violence. We believe in dialogue and in \r\na culture of peace. Dialogue between religions and \r\ncultures is a categorical imperative in our view. But \r\nthere can be no dialogue without freedom; and there \r\ncan be no freedom without a clear policy of tolerance \r\nand respect among all protagonists in a world that is \r\nincreasingly global.  \r\n My country, Honduras, consistently respects all \r\nreligions and cultures. Our constitution provides that \r\nall Hondurans are equal before the law, and it declares \r\npunishable any discrimination based on gender, race, \r\nclass or other offence against human dignity. It also \r\nguarantees the free exercise of all religions and beliefs, \r\nwithout pre-eminence for any of them. All men are \r\nborn free and equal in rights. Our Constitution also \r\nseeks to enforce and perpetuate a rule of law that \r\nguarantees a political society and encourages \r\nconditions in which individuals can realize their full \r\npotential as human beings in a context of justice, \r\nfreedom, security, stability, pluralism, peace, \r\nrepresentative democracy and concern for the common \r\ngood.  \r\n We are pleased to note that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/62/337) emphasizes that in \r\nHonduras the United Nations Population Fund \r\n(UNFPA) established an Inter-Ecclesiastical \r\nCommittee on HIV/AIDS Prevention which brings \r\ntogether leaders and representatives of the Catholic, \r\nEvangelical, Episcopalian and Adventist Churches as \r\nwell as the Ministry of Health and the theological \r\ncommunity. The Committee meets regularly and \r\norganizes forums and discussions on their churches’ \r\nresponse to HIV and AIDS. Thus far, it has organized \r\nfour inter-ecclesiastical forums on HIV/AIDS \r\nprevention throughout the country. The objective of \r\nforums is to encourage a common religious approach \r\nfor dealing with those infected and affected by \r\nHIV/AIDS. This in our view is a living example of the \r\nalliance of religions.  \r\n In this universal forum, it daily becomes more \r\nimperative for us to unite our thoughts and our hearts \r\nin acts of tolerance and mutual respect. Freedom of \r\nbelief should also go hand in hand with the freedom to \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 20 \r\n \r\nexercise that belief. The establishment of a world of \r\npeace and love should go hand in hand with the \r\ngenuine political will to achieve this. The desire to \r\nbuild an alliance of civilizations and to strengthen the \r\ndialogue between religions and cultures is within the \r\npolitical will of the States represented here. Let us \r\npromote this; let us act in this fashion; and let us work, \r\nday by day, to translate into reality all the words and \r\ndesires that are expressed here.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nguyen Tat Thanh, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Viet Nam. \r\n Mr. Nguyen Tat Thanh (Viet Nam): My \r\ndelegation wishes to express its appreciation to \r\nPakistan and the Philippines for the initiative and \r\nleadership culminating in this very timely and \r\nimportant meeting.  \r\n I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport. \r\n Having been victimized by many destructive \r\nwars, the Vietnamese people treasure peace, stability \r\nand development. We therefore fully support the efforts \r\nby countries, communities and people around the world \r\nto pursue these ends through dialogue and cooperation.  \r\n In today’s global village, interaction keeps \r\nincreasing between religions and cultures of all parts of \r\nthe world. It is an opportune time for us all to learn \r\nmore about one another, not only about our \r\ncommonalities or shared values, but also about our \r\ndifferences; to enhance unity; to accept and benefit \r\nfrom diversity; and to live with a culture of peace, non-\r\nviolence, respect, understanding and tolerance. \r\n In this regard, the importance of education and \r\nthe media in promoting respect, understanding and \r\ntolerance must be emphasized. Concerted efforts in this \r\nrespect need to be carried out at the global, regional, \r\nnational and local levels. \r\n We commend the efforts by the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith \r\nCooperation for Peace and the United Nations system, \r\nespecially UNESCO and the United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA), as mentioned in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, in promoting and implementing this \r\nidea. Viet Nam welcomes the designation of a focal \r\npoint in the Secretariat to coordinate mutually \r\nreinforcing activities of the United Nations system in \r\nthat field.  \r\n At the regional level, Vietnamese representatives \r\nof different faiths and religions actively participate in \r\nthe interfaith dialogue and exchange of experience and \r\nbest practices within the framework of the Asia-Europe \r\nMeeting and in the Asia-Pacific region to further \r\nstrengthen understanding and cooperation across \r\nregions. \r\n Viet Nam is a multi-ethnic and multireligious \r\ncountry with 54 nationalities and many different \r\nreligious communities composed of 20 millions \r\nbelievers living side by side in harmony, sharing the \r\nspirit of fraternity, mutual respect and assistance, while \r\nrespecting and cherishing each other’s unique identity. \r\nVietnamese of different nationalities, religions and \r\ncultures joined forces in the struggle for national \r\nindependence in the past and are now side by side, \r\nshouldering the task of national construction. In war or \r\nin peace, the strength of the country lies in both the \r\nunity and the diversity of its people. \r\n Back at its first meeting in 1945, the provisional \r\nGovernment of Viet Nam, under the leadership of \r\nPresident Ho Chi Minh, issued the motto “Freedom for \r\nreligious solidarity between believers and non-\r\nbelievers”. Our 1992 Constitution reaffirms that spirit \r\nin concrete terms. Our national experience and policies \r\nin that connection guide our activities at the global \r\nlevel. \r\n Before concluding, I wish to assure the General \r\nAssembly that Viet Nam will continue to make every \r\neffort, together with countries and peoples of the \r\nworld, to foster understanding and cooperation in the \r\nname of peace and development for all. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Samuel Outlule, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Botswana. \r\n Mr. Outlule (Botswana): The delegation of \r\nBotswana welcomes the convening of this High-level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace. Several \r\nstatements have already been made with a great deal of \r\neloquence and conviction. We add our voice to this \r\nimportant debate because peace is indivisible and the \r\npromotion of a culture of peace is both a national and a \r\nglobal imperative. \r\n In contributing to this debate, we are conscious of \r\nthe fact that our deliberations are an important part of \r\nthe beginning of establishing the basis for mutual \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n21 07-53011 \r\n \r\nunderstanding. It is our expectation that the statements \r\nwill be followed by introspection and the readiness to \r\nmake choices for tolerance. What matters in the end is \r\nnot what we are able to say about the peaceful nature \r\nof our respective religions and cultures, but rather what \r\nwe are prepared to do to ensure that our faiths are used \r\nas instruments for the realization of peace and good \r\nwill to humankind. We must do so by empowering \r\nnational institutions to promote a culture of tolerance, \r\ncompromise and accommodation. \r\n A combination of religion and culture has been \r\nthe defining attribute of societies since antiquity. \r\nWhilst religion is a personal matter concerning the \r\nrelationship between an individual and God, at the \r\nsame time it binds us together because our lives as \r\nhuman beings are interconnected. Thus, faith and a \r\nway of life not only bind people together, but have \r\nover the years been instrumental in informing and \r\nshaping the development of relations between peoples \r\nand States. \r\n This High-level Dialogue may be taking place a \r\nlittle too late, as it comes at a time when intolerance \r\nand hatred spurred by religious beliefs and a clash of \r\ncultures are growing at an alarming rate. And yet we \r\ncannot afford to despair or fail to act in the face of the \r\nchallenges confronting us and developments we \r\nwitness. At the same time, we must avoid a reactionary \r\nresponse by acting in a positive, purposeful and \r\nforward-looking manner. We must be fair and balanced \r\nin the search for solutions to global problems. In that \r\nway, we can avoid the politicization of religions and \r\ncultural beliefs that often leads to extremism and \r\nintolerance. \r\n In the search for solutions to contemporary \r\nchallenges associated with relations between \r\ncivilizations, we do not have to reinvent the wheel. In \r\nthe fifth century B.C., the Chinese philosopher \r\nConfucius once said: \r\n “My conduct must be guided by the golden rule \r\nof only doing and saying what I would like to \r\nhave done or said to me, and never doing or \r\nsaying anything that I would not like to have \r\ndone or said to me.” \r\nThat statement demonstrates that the desire to live in \r\npeace with one another has been the objective of \r\npeople from time immemorial. \r\n There can be no doubt that the granite foundation \r\nof interreligious and intercultural understanding and \r\ncooperation for peace is for all religions to encourage \r\ntheir followers to be kind, tolerant, merciful, just and \r\nhonest with each other and other people. If religion or \r\nthe followers of any faith fail to abide by those \r\nteachings, it will be difficult if not impossible to \r\npromote mutual understanding, cooperation and peace. \r\n In an increasingly borderless world, diverse \r\nsocieties, individuals and communities with different \r\ncultures and religious beliefs are called upon to live \r\ntogether in harmony. Individuals and communities of \r\ndifferent faiths and cultures living side by side have in \r\nthem the inherent capacity to strengthen each other and \r\nto solve concrete problems confronting them here on \r\nEarth. The world will be a better place if we can all \r\nconcentrate our actions on working together to improve \r\nthe human condition here on Earth without necessarily \r\nabandoning our aspirations for the next order of \r\nexistence. \r\n The challenge we face is to strengthen policies \r\nthat enhance the integration and participation of all \r\ncitizens on the basis of equality and respect. It would \r\nbe particularly helpful if religion did not assume a \r\nname. In that respect, parents and societies could bring \r\nup children without passing value judgements on other \r\nfaiths or dehumanizing descriptions about followers of \r\nother faiths, thus sowing the seeds of future intolerance \r\nand a sense of superiority. \r\n It is important to give greater attention to \r\neducation and training that emphasize broad \r\nknowledge about other cultures and religions and the \r\nneed for them to cohabit in peace and harmony. It is \r\ntrue that, historically, education and knowledge have \r\nforced religions to be more just, fair and tolerant. \r\n Let us recognize that interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue is not the challenge or monopoly \r\nof the faithful alone. It is the challenge of all people \r\nand organizations of civil society who love humankind, \r\nrespect life, and value harmony and the diversity of \r\npeoples on Earth. We should not forget that, through \r\nthe centuries, religious people inspired by fanaticism, \r\nfundamentalism, a sense of superiority and the selfish \r\npursuit of personal salvation have caused wars and \r\nhuman suffering. \r\n In that respect, secular individuals, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and States therefore have a \r\nmajor contribution to make in promoting international \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 22 \r\n \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace. Interreligious \r\nand intercultural understanding and cooperation must \r\nbe rooted in universal values of respect for human \r\nrights, non-discrimination, non-violence and \r\ndemocracy. Those are values of collective wisdom, \r\nconscience and progress of humankind, uniting peoples \r\nof all faiths and cultures. \r\n Africa is home to many religions and cultures. In \r\nBotswana, we are a society of many cultures, \r\nlanguages and religious practices, but as is the case \r\nelsewhere in Africa, we have embraced several other \r\nreligious beliefs from outside the continent and today \r\nthose have become an integral part of the social fabric \r\nof our societies. The Constitution of Botswana \r\nguarantees freedom of worship. Faith-based \r\norganizations are formally recognized as key players \r\nand partners with Government in many aspects of our \r\nnational development effort. \r\n We welcome the initiative of Spain and Turkey \r\nthat led to the establishment of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. It reflects a strong belief in dialogue as \r\nthe best means to remove misunderstanding, tension \r\nand conflicts, and an effective mechanism for \r\nachieving compromise, tolerance and peaceful \r\ncoexistence among peoples.  \r\n Let me conclude by emphasizing that religion and \r\nculture are part of humanity and constitute very \r\nimportant aspects of the modern world. They cannot be \r\nwished away. Our societies have become more \r\ninterconnected and interdependent because of \r\nglobalization, migration and new information and \r\ncommunication technologies. \r\n In this modern age, we must therefore strive to \r\nmake a culture of science and technology whose \r\npriority is the search for solutions to the immediate \r\nproblems of people here on Earth. That will make it \r\npossible for religions and cultures to flourish. That will \r\nin turn enable us to celebrate our diversity and use it as \r\na platform for human progress, mutual understanding \r\nand peace. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Sanja Štiglic, chairperson of the \r\ndelegation of Slovenia. \r\n Ms. Štiglic (Slovenia): Allow me to begin by \r\nsaying that Slovenia aligns itself fully with the \r\nstatement delivered yesterday by the representative of \r\nPortugal on behalf of the European Union. \r\n I am particularly honoured to address the General \r\nAssembly on this occasion. We all agree that the \r\nimprovement of understanding and cooperation among \r\npeople of different religions and cultures is a must if \r\nwe are to forge together a world in which we can live \r\nside by side in peace. That indubitable common \r\nobjective is a simple yet resounding example of the \r\nfact that we as human beings have far more things to \r\nbind us together than to keep us apart. \r\n We all know that the globalized world of today \r\nstands at an important crossroads. Events of the past \r\nfew years have aggravated relations between different \r\nparts of the world to the point where we can no longer \r\nshy away from directing all our efforts to establishing \r\nan active dialogue among the world’s ethnicities, \r\nreligions and cultures. We all have to join in that effort \r\nso that we can, together, build bridges between our \r\ndifferent cultures and contribute to better \r\nunderstanding between our civilizations and a better \r\nfuture for us all. \r\n Let me note at this point that the need for \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue is not in any \r\nway limited to intercontinental conversations or even \r\nto conversations among different countries. The reality \r\nof a multicultural society exists within our countries \r\nthemselves. Those differences, too, must be \r\nacknowledged, but they should never divide us. Rather, \r\nthey should be seen as an opportunity to find new ways \r\nto achieve mutual understanding and greater respect for \r\neach other. \r\n Given the growing number of different initiatives \r\non intercultural and interfaith understanding — such as \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, the Asia-Europe Meeting \r\nInterfaith Dialogue, the Euromed Barcelona process, \r\nthe Council of Europe white paper on intercultural \r\ndialogue, and many others — we believe that there is a \r\nneed for enhanced coordination, cooperation and \r\ncomplementarity among them, and particularly among \r\nthose within the United Nations framework.  \r\n My country wishes to contribute to the \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue by promoting \r\nglobal understanding, overcoming prejudices, and \r\nrepresenting a pillar of humanism and cooperation in \r\nthe Mediterranean. In that regard, I would like to focus \r\non two particular elements that can, in our view, most \r\neffectively contribute to dialogue, peace and \r\ncooperation. These, in our view, are human rights and \r\ndiversity education. \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n23 07-53011 \r\n \r\n Ariel and Will Durant wrote that education is the \r\ntransmission of civilization. We believe that the true \r\ntransmission of civilization is its continuous \r\nenhancement, not by the mere emulation of established \r\nparadigms, but precisely by learning new things, by \r\ntrying to understand foreign concepts, by seeking to \r\nempathize with the values of others, by promoting \r\nsolidarity among peoples, and by building a \r\ncomprehensive global culture of human rights and \r\nmutual understanding. \r\n As part of the intercultural dialogue, it is \r\nimportant to promote mobility, especially that of young \r\npeople, for what better way is there to learn about the \r\nrest of the world than to travel to it? With the hope of \r\nbringing together young people from around the world \r\nso that they may learn from each other, my country \r\nrecently presented an initiative to establish a Euro-\r\nMediterranean university, with its seat in Piran, \r\nSlovenia. It is our hope that the university will be able \r\nto contribute in some way to dialogue among youth and \r\nscholars from diverse religious and cultural \r\nbackgrounds in the Mediterranean basin. \r\n Allow me to take this opportunity also to mention \r\nanother initiative that has special importance for us. In \r\nMay 2006, the Slovenian Government established the \r\nCentre for European Perspective. The Centre was \r\nestablished with the intent of developing new thinking \r\naimed at addressing outstanding issues in the European \r\nUnion and wider Europe. One of the Centre’s main \r\nobjectives is also to work towards the establishment of \r\ntolerant societies by implementing projects that will \r\ncreate and maintain conditions for a successful \r\ndialogue among the different religious and cultural \r\ncommunities within Europe and beyond. We have \r\norganized numerous meetings and round tables with \r\npolitical and religious leaders alike from the western \r\nBalkan region.  \r\n We have also established this year a task force on \r\nintercultural dialogue. Members of the task force are \r\ninternational and Slovenian experts of different profiles \r\nor backgrounds, such as politicians, religious \r\nrepresentatives, dignitaries, academics and \r\nrepresentatives of various public institutions and \r\norganizations. My country truly believes that \r\nintercultural dialogue should be encouraged and \r\nfostered, and we want to do something about it. It must \r\nbe stressed, however, that a crucial precondition for \r\nany such dialogue is freedom of expression of thought, \r\nconscience, religion and belief, and we shall continue \r\nto work in support of those important rights. \r\n For the coming year, the Centre for European \r\nPerspective has planned two projects that are aimed at \r\nfostering dialogue between cultures in Europe. The \r\nfirst project will concern questions of secularism, \r\npolitical radicalism and immigration in the European \r\nUnion; the second will try to answer the important \r\nquestion of how to make people of different religions \r\nand cultural backgrounds who come to Europe feel at \r\nhome in the European Union. \r\n Allow me to conclude by stating that respect for \r\nhuman dignity and diversity is the cornerstone of any \r\npeaceful and prosperous society. Let us build, then, \r\nupon our common values and translate them into \r\naction. My country, for one, extends its hand to anyone \r\nwho wishes to join us in bringing more understanding \r\ninto this world. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Juan Antonio Yáñez-Barnuevo, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Spain. \r\n Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me to begin by congratulating the President of \r\nthe General Assembly and the sponsors of this \r\ninitiative, the Philippines and Pakistan, for organizing \r\nthis High-level Dialogue. The participation of \r\nGovernment representatives and prominent active \r\nmembers of civil society provides us with a good \r\nopportunity to share ideas and opinions that will allow \r\nus to advance along the road of understanding among \r\npeoples and societies belonging to different cultures \r\nand religions for the good of peace and the progress of \r\npeoples. \r\n Spain is aware of the importance of the challenge \r\nposed by the need for understanding among nations \r\nand peoples in today’s world, and is a firm defender of \r\ndialogue and cooperation as instruments for fighting \r\nintolerance and discrimination based on cultural or \r\nreligious differences. \r\n We are convinced that the grave problems arising \r\nfrom the lack of mutual awareness, from intolerance in \r\nthe face of difference, or from rejection of what is \r\nforeign require joint action by the international \r\ncommunity, especially in the framework of the United \r\nNations. This Organization has offered of late a good \r\nexample of commitment in that field by adopting in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, after many years of negotiations, \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 24 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \r\nIndigenous Peoples. \r\n Spain is therefore very pleased with the progress \r\nmade with initiatives such as this, in which we \r\nparticipate with conviction, and with others, such as \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, which Spain is \r\nco-sponsoring with Turkey and which has already been \r\nconsolidated as a United Nations initiative, as was \r\nhighlighted by the Secretary-General in his statement \r\nyesterday at the beginning of this Dialogue. \r\n We believe that the complementary nature of \r\ninitiatives with similar goals is a clear and valuable \r\nsign of the importance which the international \r\ncommunity attaches to the need to encourage tolerance, \r\nrespect, dialogue and cooperation in promoting \r\nunderstanding and coexistence among civilizations, \r\ncultures and religions in a globalized world such as \r\nours today. That complementary nature must find \r\nappropriate ways to avoid any unnecessary duplication \r\nand to combine valuable efforts to the same end.  \r\n In that regard, I support the statement made \r\nyesterday by the Minister of State of Portugal on behalf \r\nof the European Union with respect to the role that \r\ncould be played by the Alliance of Civilizations in \r\nensuring such coherence. The statement read out \r\nyesterday on behalf of the High Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio, had a similar thrust. \r\n The contribution of the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nto the common goal of understanding among religions \r\nand cultures, as well as to cooperation for peace, could \r\nbe synthesized in the following elements. First, the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations has a mandate that is \r\nessentially pragmatic, focusing on joint action and on \r\nobtaining specific results. One of its goals is to move \r\nfrom the realm of ideas towards the practical, concrete \r\nand specific.  \r\n With that spirit as guide, the implementation plan \r\nfor the next two years, as presented last June by \r\nMr. Sampaio, the High Representative for the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations, contains ideas, projects and concrete \r\nprogrammes that are focused on action in four specific \r\nareas: youth, education, migration and the media. \r\nThose areas are thought to be where major \r\ncontributions could be made to combat the lack of \r\ndialogue and understanding among peoples and \r\nsocieties that belong to different cultures and religions. \r\nThe goal is to encourage mutual understanding, to end \r\npreconceived notions about the other, and to promote \r\nexchange and coexistence in order to encourage \r\nrespect, tolerance and dialogue, rejecting any \r\namalgamation of religion or belief, regardless of \r\ndenomination, with extremism and violence. We must \r\ndo all that through education and with the cooperation \r\nof the media as we specifically address collective \r\ngroups that are especially vulnerable in those matters, \r\nsuch as youth and migrants. \r\n Secondly, as noted by the High Representative, it \r\nis necessary for decisions on this issue to be adopted \r\nwith a global focus. At the same time, however, the \r\ndevelopment of activities at the local level is critical, \r\nsince it will guarantee their true implementation and \r\nensure that their content effectively penetrates the \r\nsocieties they address. The problems that arise from a \r\nlack of understanding among peoples and societies of \r\ndifferent religions or cultures germinate and develop at \r\nthe local level, even when they rise to the global level. \r\nFor that reason, action must be directed mainly at the \r\nvery heart of societies themselves.  \r\n In that regard, we feel that another good point of \r\ndeparture could be the suggestion made by High \r\nRepresentative Sampaio at the recent ministerial \r\nmeeting of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations that international organizations — be they \r\nuniversal or regional — develop their own work \r\nprogrammes for cooperation with the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, in particular in the four thematic areas on \r\nwhich the initiative focuses. He also suggested that \r\nStates develop national strategies for transcultural \r\ndialogue pursuant to the principles of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. \r\n At the national level, Spain is already working on \r\ndefining its own national plan for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, a goal of which, among others, will be to \r\naddress the national and international aspects of \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. In addition, I \r\ntake this opportunity to highlight the First Annual \r\nForum of the Alliance of Civilizations to take place in \r\nSpain on 15 and 16 January 2008. The Forum will seek \r\nto be a platform for reinforcing political support for the \r\ninitiative and for obtaining concrete results in the area \r\nof youth, among others. It will be a good occasion to \r\ndebate and share common progress that has been made, \r\nas well as to enrich the Alliance implementation plan \r\nwith new ideas. \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n25 07-53011 \r\n \r\n We hope that the Alliance of Civilizations will \r\nbecome a reference framework for States, international \r\norganizations, representatives of civil society — whose \r\ntask we deem to be of crucial importance — and other \r\nactors in the sphere of intercultural dialogue. Special \r\nbut not exclusive consideration should be given to \r\nrelations between the West and the Islamic world, the \r\nneed for which has been stressed during our debates \r\nyesterday and today. The Alliance would thus \r\nconstitute a useful tool for crisis prevention and \r\nmanagement in that respect. \r\n In the immediate future, and in line with \r\nproposals contained in the implementation plan, we \r\nbelieve that there exists a high degree of consensus \r\nconcerning initiatives suggested within the framework \r\nof the Alliance, which we hope will soon come to \r\nfruition. Some include the creation of a rapid-response \r\nmedia mechanism in times of crisis; the expansion of \r\nintercultural exchanges among young people, who \r\nshould receive support from specific funds for projects \r\nthat promote dialogue and tolerance; and the use of \r\nmechanisms at the community, regional and local \r\nlevels for establishing dialogue and preventing and \r\novercoming conflicts. \r\n Spain believes in a past, a present and, indeed, a \r\nfuture replete with diversity and cultural and religious \r\npluralism. We are convinced that such diversity and \r\npluralism constitute one of our major assets, and their \r\nintegration represents both a national political and a \r\nforeign policy challenge. \r\n We are convinced that diversity can be integrated \r\nonly through dialogue, understanding, respect and \r\ntolerance. For that reason, we will muster all of our \r\nenergy, pragmatically but on a principled basis, to \r\npromote actions that are addressed at reconciliation, \r\nmutual knowledge and understanding among peoples \r\nand societies belonging to different cultures and \r\nreligions, since we know that this task represents the \r\ngreatest challenge of our time. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, \r\nchairperson of the delegation of Brazil. \r\n Ms. Ribeiro Viotti (Brazil): Brazil welcomes the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace. I would like \r\nto express appreciation to the delegations of the \r\nPhilippines and Pakistan for spearheading the \r\ninitiative. \r\n A high-level dialogue on such an important issue \r\nis well placed and timely. The sense of a widening gap \r\nand lack of mutual understanding between societies \r\nand cultures has been a source of heightened concern \r\nin recent years. The need to understand that \r\nphenomenon and to advance dialogue and cooperation \r\nto bridge divides and overcome the threats emanating \r\nfrom them is being increasingly felt. It is only fitting \r\nthat the dialogue should take place in the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n It is timely to highlight the importance of \r\ndialogue and diplomacy at a juncture when such \r\npowerful instruments could be used to their fullest \r\nextent. Such a dialogue would probably show that \r\nconflicts usually perceived as motivated by religious \r\nand ethnic differences have an underlying source of \r\ninequality and exclusion that breed radicalism, \r\nfanaticism and violence. Today, such problems mark \r\nrelations between nations and within societies, \r\nregardless of their levels of development. \r\n Extremism should not be allowed to prosper. \r\nViolent manifestations of extremism cannot be \r\ntolerated or justified on any grounds. However, in \r\norder to address such threats, one has to take into \r\naccount the distressing environment that has often been \r\nexploited and exacerbated by extremists in many \r\nsocieties. In some cases, the reality of social exclusion \r\nand inequality is compounded by the persistence of \r\nsituations of domination and injustice that keep peoples \r\nand nations from developing the basic conditions for \r\nbuilding a dignified and sovereign future. \r\n As a multi-ethnic, multicultural society composed \r\nmainly of populations from indigenous, European and \r\nAfrican origins, Brazil values the diversity of the \r\nhuman experience. Immigrants from all parts of the \r\nworld have been welcomed to our country and have \r\nenriched our culture with their contributions. \r\nBrazilians take pride in such multifaceted origins. A \r\nconstantly evolving and mutually reinforcing process \r\nof dialogue, interaction and exchange among cultures \r\nhas permeated our social manifestations. Diversity, \r\ntherefore, is an essential part of and cornerstone upon \r\nwhich our very identity is based. \r\n Brazilians of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim \r\nfaiths live together in harmony and strive to make the \r\ncountry more socially just and prosperous. In Brazil, \r\nwe have been resolutely confronting the grave \r\ninequalities that have accumulated since the early \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 26 \r\n \r\nstages of the country’s development. Public policies \r\nhave been implemented in recent years to reduce \r\npoverty and eliminate hunger. The results so far have \r\nbeen encouraging. \r\n Thus, from a Brazilian perspective, understanding \r\nand cooperation among different cultures and religions \r\nare not only possible, but also a goal to be pursued. At \r\nthe United Nations, our best efforts must be devoted to \r\nunderstanding the roots of extremism and to helping \r\npromote an environment in which fanaticism cannot \r\nthrive. The promotion of cross-cultural and interfaith \r\ndialogues such as today’s is most useful. \r\n Brazil also strongly supports the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, an initiative proposed by the President of \r\nthe Spanish Government in 2005 and co-sponsored by \r\nthe Turkish Prime Minister. Within the Group of \r\nFriends, we will work with the High Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General for the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio, former President of Portugal, to \r\nfurther the goals of promoting understanding and \r\ntolerance among different cultures and civilizations. \r\n Cultural liberty implies being able to choose \r\none’s identity without losing respect for others or being \r\nexcluded from other choices in life. People want the \r\nfreedom to practice their own religion, to speak their \r\nown language, and to celebrate their own ethnic or \r\nreligious heritage without fear of discrimination. \r\n States face a challenge in responding to those \r\ndemands. If well managed, they will bring greater \r\ncultural diversity and enrich people’s lives. If poorly \r\nmanaged, they could result in xenophobia, encourage \r\nconservative agendas and block the diffusion of new \r\nideas, knowledge and skills. \r\n Globalization is driving increasing interaction \r\namong peoples and cultures. That calls for greater \r\nrespect for diversity, as well as a stronger commitment \r\nto universal values and principles, which impart \r\nvalidity to that approach. It is worth remembering the \r\nconsensus of the Vienna World Conference on Human \r\nRights of 1993:  \r\n  “All human rights are universal, indivisible \r\nand interdependent and interrelated … While the \r\nsignificance of national and regional \r\nparticularities and various historical, cultural and \r\nreligious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it \r\nis the duty of States, regardless of their political, \r\neconomic and cultural systems, to promote and \r\nprotect all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms.” (A/CONF.157/23, part I, para. 5) \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Adrian Neritani, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Albania. \r\n Mr. Neritani (Albania): May I commend the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the co-sponsors \r\nPhilippines and Pakistan on this important and timely \r\ninitiative. Indeed, the way world affairs are headed, the \r\nquestion of interreligious dialogue and culture of \r\ncompromise and cooperation deserves our due \r\nattention and action. \r\n Dialogue has always been a key instrument in the \r\nprocess of building peace in the minds of men. \r\nCivilizations are inherently intercultural; they have \r\nbeen and continue to be enriched by contacts, \r\nexchange, dialogue among peoples and the ability to \r\nnaturally change and adapt with the passing of time. In \r\nthat regard, we support the role of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and other initiatives that further those \r\nends. \r\n Albanians are traditionally tolerant and averse to \r\nany form of extremism. The ordinary Albanian grows \r\nup in an atmosphere in which religious differentiation \r\nis implied. The fact that an Albanian is Muslim, \r\nOrthodox or Catholic does not define a demarcation \r\nline versus the other. Those and other elements have \r\nshaped our innate and natural tolerance. Religious \r\ntolerance among Albanians is not a quality developed \r\nin modern times or shaped through education and \r\nschooling. It is a tradition that originates from the \r\ndepths of the centuries. The tolerance of three faiths is \r\nclosely linked with the nation and its existence. It is at \r\nthe essence and goes to the very heart of our \r\nfoundation, learned the hard way through life and \r\nhistory. \r\n Tolerance among Albanians is not only religious, \r\nbut also linguistic and ethnic. The coexistence of three \r\nreligions in Albania is a peculiar tendency in a region \r\nwhere religion has often been connected to nationalism \r\nand where fratricidal wars have been fought in the \r\nname of belief. The ethnicization of religion has \r\nproved to be bad and dangerous. Wars are enemies of \r\nreligion, which they distort.  \r\n During the past decade or so, the Balkans \r\nexperienced those miseries, which, combined with \r\nnationalistic policies, were transformed into human \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n27 07-53011 \r\n \r\ntragedies. We sincerely hope that the remnants of those \r\npolicies and/or politicians or their proxies will come to \r\nan end sooner rather than later and let our region \r\nnaturally prosper and develop, as it deserves to do. \r\nNationalistic policies, cultivated in many cases with a \r\ngreat deal of fanaticism and even ethnic cleansing, are \r\nopenly opposed to that trend. The willingness to use \r\nrhetoric could be better channelled to address issues \r\nrealistically. \r\n Recognizing the unique case that Albania \r\nrepresents in the domain of interreligious harmony, \r\nunder the joint auspices of the Director-General of \r\nUNESCO and the Government of Albania a Regional \r\nSummit on Interreligious and Interethnic Dialogue was \r\nheld in Tirana, the Albanian capital, a few years ago. \r\nThe Summit served as a medium for sharing national \r\nand regional experiences, defining a framework for \r\ncooperation, and identifying concrete initiatives and \r\nprogrammes to the benefit of prosperity, development \r\nand, above all, peace in the region at large. On that \r\noccasion, heads of State and Government and other \r\nparticipants representing all countries of South-East \r\nEurope adopted the Tirana Summit Declaration, which \r\nfor the first time defined the contribution of \r\ninterreligious or interfaith dialogue to the broader \r\ndialogue. \r\n In Tirana, leaders and policymakers from South-\r\nEast Europe committed themselves to  \r\n “the education of a new European generation in \r\nthe spirit of inclusiveness, instilling a feeling of \r\nforgiveness instead of hatred, promoting \r\ntolerance, understanding and coexistence rather \r\nthan conflict and violence, reinforcing civic \r\neducation and observing human rights”.  \r\nThey also situated cultural diversity and heritage as \r\nvectors of identity and tools for reconciliation by \r\ndefining cultural heritage, in both its tangible and \r\nintangible forms, as indivisible and embodying the \r\nsymbolic values of cultural identities. A special appeal \r\nwas made to capitalize on information and \r\ncommunication technologies and  \r\n “their innate potential to advance freedom of \r\nexpression, which is the cornerstone of any \r\ndemocratic society and has its corollary in the \r\nfreedom of the press”. \r\nMost importantly, the Tirana Declaration emphasized \r\nthat  \r\n “[a]ll religious leaders, like other civil society \r\nand community leaders, have the potential to \r\nexercise a moral and positive influence on how \r\npeople in society understand each other and \r\ninteract”.  \r\nReconciliation of freedom and equality in our countries \r\nand beyond is an effort worth making. \r\n Today, there is growing recognition that \r\ninterreligious dialogue must be expanded to contribute \r\nproactively to social cohesion, stability and mutual \r\nunderstanding everywhere. Religious leaders are called \r\non to reinforce among their congregations and faithful \r\nthe precepts of dialogue among civilizations, cultures \r\nand peoples, in particular the broadly agreed body of \r\ncommonly shared ethical values. As the Tirana \r\nDeclaration summarizes the matter at hand, “[r]eligion \r\nmust not be part of the problem, but part of the \r\nsolution”. \r\n Albania’s peaceful religious pluralism is of value \r\nto the country, the Balkans and beyond. It is a model of \r\nreligious coexistence. Although it is tied to ethnic \r\nhomogeneity, its value has no national borderlines and \r\nit is biased towards the values of democratic societies. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Akec Khoc, chairman of the delegation \r\nof Sudan. \r\n Mr. Khoc (Sudan): I am greatly honoured to \r\nrepresent the Sudan, my country, in this High-level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace, which is of \r\ngreat relevance to the Sudan.  \r\n I could not agree more with the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly when he stated at the 17th meeting: \r\n“We are reaffirming the values enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter … and taking concrete steps to \r\nadvance those values around the world”. That need \r\nresounded loudly during the general debate and from \r\nall corners of the globe. I wish to associate myself with \r\nearlier speakers in commending his leadership and the \r\ntwo co-sponsors of this meeting, the Philippines and \r\nPakistan. \r\n In the Sudan, Islam and Christianity have always \r\ncoexisted and interacted. However, conflict based on \r\ncontrol of economic resources, rather than on violence \r\nand extremism, has infrequently surfaced in those \r\nrelationships. Our relationship with neighbouring \r\npeoples, cultures and religions has been and is still \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 28 \r\n \r\nfounded on dialogue. Given the facility of movement \r\nacross its borders, the Sudan is a land of diverse \r\ncultures and religions from which emerge our strength. \r\nThe fact that pluralism cannot remain cohesive unless \r\nit seeks and remains anchored in cooperation, \r\nharmonious dialogue and the culture of peace, stability \r\nand security cannot be overstressed. Our geographical \r\nlocation in the Horn of Africa, sharing common \r\nborders with nine nations and a tenth across the Red \r\nSea, requires the creation of strong dialogue \r\nmechanisms if we are to interact harmoniously with all \r\nthose neighbours. \r\n There are over 300 cultural groups in the Sudan. \r\nTherefore, intercultural dialogue and cooperation have \r\nalways been at the centre of our relations. However, \r\nthe changing times of the twenty-first century and \r\ncyber and other technologies dictate that such dialogue \r\nand cooperation be intensified and scaled up. We need \r\nand are exercising them today more than ever. \r\n The Interim National Constitution and other laws \r\nderived therefrom defend and promote interreligious \r\ndialogue, tolerance, cooperation and respect for \r\nreligious and cultural diversity. They stipulate \r\ncitizenship based on a number of rights that sometimes \r\ncollide with each other. Therefore, dialogue must justly \r\nremain the best choice for resolving those and other \r\nmatters that might interfere with our pluralistic \r\npeaceful coexistence. \r\n The conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement between the South and the North of the \r\nSudan in January 2005 and other subsequent peace \r\naccords added more flesh to the pluralistic dimension. \r\nFor example, the formation of an almost all-inclusive \r\nGovernment of National Unity, including members \r\nprofessing various faiths and sects within the same \r\nfaiths, required long sessions of open-minded dialogue, \r\ncooperation and tolerance. \r\n At a time of globalization, we cannot remain \r\nfocused on national actions alone. We must coexist and \r\ninteract with the greater family of nations and peoples \r\nworldwide. We call on all stakeholders, public and \r\nprivate, national and international, to acknowledge the \r\nlegitimate rights of all peoples to assert their religious \r\nand cultural identities through dialogue. We equally \r\nencourage all regional institutions to energize their \r\ninterreligious and intercultural cooperation institutions \r\nwhere they exist or to create them where absent.  \r\n I wish to end by reasserting importance of the \r\npreamble of UNESCO’s Constitution — “since wars \r\nbegin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men \r\nthat the defences of peace must be constructed” — in \r\nfostering peaceful coexistence in the spirit of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alexei Tulbure, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Moldova. \r\n Mr. Tulbure (Moldova): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to underline that Moldova fully subscribes to the \r\nstatement made on behalf of the European Union by \r\nthe representative of Portugal, but I would nevertheless \r\nadd some additional remarks. \r\n It gives me special pleasure to address the \r\nparticipants at the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace, and on behalf of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Moldova I would like \r\nto commend the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nand the co-sponsors, the Philippines and Pakistan, for \r\nconceiving and organizing this important event. \r\n During our debates, many delegations have \r\nreflected on the dialogue among cultures and religious, \r\nemphasizing the importance of the peaceful \r\ncoexistence of nations and praising the value of \r\ntolerance and mutual understanding. In our globalized \r\nworld, peoples, religions and cultures interact and \r\ninfluence one another at a level inconceivable by our \r\npredecessors, but crucial to our successors. Therefore, \r\nthe general commitment to overcoming old divisions, \r\noppositions and confrontations and to establishing and \r\nmaintaining a genuine dialogue among civilizations \r\nbased on understanding, tolerance and mutual respect \r\ngives hope for the peoples of our global village. \r\n Moldova, a country with a rich and deep-rooted \r\nhistory, culture and traditions, was for centuries a \r\nnexus for the interaction of different peoples and \r\ncultures, being located on a historic passageway \r\nbetween Asia and Europe. Representatives of diverse \r\nethnic groups, speakers of many languages and \r\nfollowers of different religions found a homeland in \r\nMoldova. The population of our multi-ethnic country \r\ndeveloped a unique sense of tolerance that became a \r\ncharacteristic of the Moldovan national mentality. \r\n Building on those historic experiences, and \r\nintegrating the fundamental principles enshrined in the \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n29 07-53011 \r\n \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, our Constitution \r\ndeclares Moldova the common and indivisible \r\nmotherland of all its citizens. The State recognizes and \r\nguarantees all its citizens the right to preserve, develop \r\nand express their ethnic, cultural, linguistic and \r\nreligious identities.  \r\n In 2004, a new law was enacted, adopting the \r\nconcept of Moldova’s State national policy. Tolerance \r\nand respect for the languages, cultures, and religions of \r\nall ethnic communities living in Moldova were \r\ndeclared an indispensable condition for political \r\nsovereignty and civic peace in our country. Moldova \r\ndeclared its determination to build a harmonious multi-\r\nethnic society, based on the principles of ethnic and \r\nlinguistic liberalism and pluralism. \r\n Freedom of conscience and of religious worship \r\nis guaranteed under the supreme law of the country, \r\nwhich stipulates that its manifestations should be in a \r\nspirit of tolerance and mutual respect. In their mutual \r\nrelationships, religious cults are forbidden to use, \r\nexpress or incite hatred or enmity. The law forbids and \r\nprosecutes all actions aimed at ethnic, racial or \r\nreligious hatred and incitement to discrimination. \r\n Recently, the Moldovan Parliament adopted a law \r\non religious cults, seeking to modernize Moldovan \r\nlegislation and to bring it into accordance with \r\ninternational standards, including the European \r\nConvention and Protocol for the Protection of Human \r\nRights and Fundamental Freedoms. In referring to the \r\nCouncil of Europe, let me underline how much we \r\nvalue and look forward to the conclusion of the \r\nCouncil’s work on the comprehensive document known \r\nas the white paper on intercultural dialogue. The white \r\npaper translates the concept of intercultural dialogue \r\nby identifying five tasks: developing the democratic \r\ngovernance of cultural diversity; strengthening \r\ndemocratic citizenship and participation; learning and \r\nteaching intercultural competences; creating spaces for \r\nintercultural dialogue; and developing intercultural \r\ndialogue in international relations. We are convinced \r\nthat this is very important for all of us. \r\n In its recent history, the Republic of Moldova \r\nunderwent a bitter experience of internal conflict that \r\nresulted in the secession and isolation of a part of its \r\nterritory. Politicians, academic representatives, and \r\nresearchers from different countries have thoroughly \r\nexamined the nature of the conflict and expressed their \r\nbroad concurrence on its absence of religious, ethnic \r\nand cultural roots. Regrettably, the economic and \r\npolitical interests of some unscrupulous individuals \r\nand groups still cause the separation of families, \r\ncultural and religious communities and ethnic groups, \r\ndenying their basic human rights and hindering the free \r\nexpression of identities and beliefs. \r\n Conflicts all around the world divert enormous \r\nresources and time from our societies and threaten our \r\ndevelopment. Governments and societies try to settle \r\nthem, to overcome their legacies and to bridge the gaps \r\nbetween communities, peoples and individuals. While \r\nso many different experiences, methods and strategies \r\nhave been shared from this rostrum yesterday and \r\ntoday, I would like to emphasize once more the \r\nimportance of education in the promotion of tolerance, \r\nrespect and mutual understanding.  \r\n Education, in particular at school, has a key role \r\nin the construction of pluralistic and inclusive \r\nsocieties. However, laws and regulations alone are \r\ninsufficient for providing education in the spirit of \r\npeace and tolerance. It is of high importance to train \r\nteachers and to develop textbooks and curriculums that \r\ninclude lessons of mutual understanding, tolerance, the \r\nprotection of human rights, and knowledge of and \r\nrespect for foreign cultures, peoples and countries. In \r\nthat regard, we commend the activities and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the United \r\nNations Children’s Fund, and other international and \r\nregional organizations aimed at promoting peace, \r\ntolerance and cultural diversity through dialogue and \r\neducation. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that my \r\ncountry, Moldova, strongly supports the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations initiative. We welcome the appointment \r\nof Jorge Sampaio, former President of Portugal, as the \r\nHigh Representative of the Secretary-General for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, and express our conviction \r\nthat, with the concrete involvement of Member States, \r\nwe will advance in promoting dialogue and mutual \r\nunderstanding among cultures and religions around the \r\nworld. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, \r\nSecretary for Relations with States of the Observer \r\nState of the Holy See. \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 30 \r\n \r\n Archbishop Mamberti (Holy See): In an effort, \r\nMadame, to meet your recommendation to be brief, my \r\ndelegation is circulating its written text, and I shall \r\nread out an abridged version. \r\n There cannot be peace without understanding and \r\ncooperation among religions. There cannot be \r\nunderstanding and cooperation among religions \r\nwithout religious liberty. The safeguarding and \r\npromotion of religious liberty for all requires both \r\nState action and religious responsibility. \r\n States and international organizations are called \r\non to adhere to and enforce the principles of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and allied \r\ninternational instruments, such as the Declaration on \r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of \r\nDiscrimination Based on Religion or Belief. \r\n The full exercise of the right to religious freedom \r\nis based on respect for human reason and its capacity \r\nto know the truth. It ensures openness to transcendence \r\nas an indispensable guarantee of human dignity. It \r\nallows all religions to publicly manifest their own \r\nidentity, free from any pressure to hide or disguise it. \r\nReligious freedom includes the right to disseminate \r\none’s own faith and the right to change it. Respect for \r\nreligious liberty would unmask the attempts of some \r\nterrorists to justify their unjustifiable actions on \r\nreligious grounds. \r\n If violence continues to arise between religious \r\ngroups, anti-incitement programmes in civil society \r\nshould be supported, especially when they are initiated \r\nby local groups belonging to cross-religious alliances. \r\nAnti-incitement activities include education and the \r\nmobilization of religious leaders and mass movements \r\nopposing hate speech and other public acts calculated \r\nto spur sectarian violence. \r\n Religious minorities do not seek special \r\nprotection or status so long as their right to religious \r\nfreedom is fully guaranteed and they are not \r\ndiscriminated against on religious grounds. In fact, \r\nthey should enjoy the same civil rights as the general \r\npopulation and members of the majority religion — for \r\nexample, in the construction or repair of places of \r\nworship. \r\n Fruitful high-level international gatherings of \r\nreligious leaders aimed at praying for and promoting \r\npeace should be replicated at the national and local \r\nlevels. Indeed, prayer and good intentions are authentic \r\nonly if they are translated into practical gestures at all \r\nlevels. If religions want to build peace, they must teach \r\nforgiveness. In fact, there can be no peace without \r\njustice, and there can be no justice without forgiveness. \r\nReligious communities can also make a positive \r\ncontribution to peace by educating their own members \r\nabout their teachings on peace and solidarity. \r\n By promoting interreligious programmes focused \r\non development cooperation, we can also foster \r\ndialogue and make significant contributions to \r\npeacemaking in societies afflicted by conflict, working \r\nwith local groups in the areas of anti-incitement, peace \r\nand non-violence education, conflict transformation \r\nand negotiation. \r\n At a time when the so-called clash of civilizations \r\nis gaining currency in some quarters, religions have a \r\nspecial role to play in blazing new paths towards \r\npeace, in union with one another and in cooperation \r\nwith States and international organizations. In order to \r\nempower religions to fully assume that role, all of us \r\nmust work together to ensure that religious freedom is \r\nrecognized, safeguarded and fostered by everyone \r\neverywhere. If this High-level Dialogue is to bear fruit, \r\nour message today must go beyond the confines of this \r\nHall to reach and touch each and every person and \r\ncommunity of believers throughout the world. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 3369 (XXX), of  \r\n10 October 1975, I now call upon His Excellency \r\nMr. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, Secretary-General of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. \r\n Mr. Ihsanoglu (Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference): I will present an abridged version of my \r\nstatement. The full text will be made available to \r\ndelegations.  \r\n We have been listening with great attention to the \r\ngeneral and rich debate that started yesterday on the \r\nsubject of interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace. I have no \r\nintention of repeating what has been said by preceding \r\nspeakers. Rather, I would like to say that there is \r\noverwhelming agreement concerning the importance of \r\ninterreligious and intercultural understanding in \r\npeacebuilding and ensuring security and prosperity \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n We in the Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\n(OIC) fully agree with that conclusion. We have \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n31 07-53011 \r\n \r\nexpressed our thanks and gratitude to Pakistan and the \r\nPhilippines, the two sponsors of this highly appreciated \r\ninitiative. Its subject matter is currently of great \r\nconcern to the international community and constitutes \r\none of the great challenges for humanity. \r\n It is for the same reason that we have welcomed \r\nthe idea of the Alliance of Civilizations, which is \r\ngaining momentum. We have already committed \r\nourselves to working diligently to ensure its success. \r\nHaving been involved for nearly 10 years in the issue \r\nof the dialogue among civilizations, and having \r\ninitiated the Dialogue among Civilizations in 1998, the \r\nOIC has succeeded in placing this issue on the agenda \r\nof the General Assembly. We were also gratified when \r\nthe Assembly declared 2001 the Year of Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations and, to that end, organized many \r\nactivities and programmes around the world. We are \r\nnow very satisfied to see that this issue has begun to \r\noccupy a prominent place among the major concerns of \r\nthe international community and to see the rich \r\nproliferation of interfaith dialogues. Today’s high-level \r\nmeeting is another manifestation of that importance.  \r\n Having said that, we cannot but admit that \r\nprogress in moving from the phase of debating to that \r\nof concrete action continues to be lacking. Very few \r\nprogrammes or projects have found their way to \r\nimplementation. Even fewer attempts have been made \r\nto address conflicts on the basis of the foundations of \r\nfaith. That is why we firmly believe that interfaith \r\ndialogue and understanding should not remain an \r\nempty slogan, without substance.  \r\n We badly need practical and concrete measures to \r\naddress this issue, upon which the fate of world peace \r\nand security depends. It is from that perspective that \r\nwe have welcomed the new agenda of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, which is focused on addressing the issues \r\nof youth, education, media and immigration from a \r\npractical standpoint. There is no doubt that those issues \r\nrepresent a serious source of friction in international \r\nrelations.  \r\n In the same way, we believe that there is no \r\nalternative to dialogue. Dialogue is the only way to \r\nachieve understanding. It is indispensable in building \r\nbridges as a means of communication between \r\nreligions and cultures.  \r\n It seems to us that there are deficiencies in \r\nconceiving of and conducting dialogue. Some among \r\nus talk of dialogue for the sake of dialogue and of \r\nnothing beyond that. Others speak of dialogue without \r\nhaving any political will to reach a genuine positive \r\nresult. Some groups do not see the need to practise \r\ndialogue on the basis of equal esteem for various \r\ntraditions and cultures. Others claim to exclusively \r\nrepresent the truth or to be superior to others.  \r\n On the basis of those and other considerations, \r\nwe have found ourselves unable to forge ahead as we \r\nhad all expected to do. We believe that, if we are to \r\nremedy these shortcomings, interfaith dialogue should \r\nbe aimed not at reaching doctrinal agreements, but \r\nrather at increasing sensitivity towards and \r\nappreciation of others. Dialogue should also be \r\nfounded on values shared by all in the contemporary \r\nworld.  \r\n Moreover, the goal of dialogue should be an \r\nethical globalization in which each civilization \r\nmaintains its identity as a contributor to the creation of \r\na spirit of shared humanity and respect for all.  \r\n In the context of ethics, we in the OIC have \r\ncalled for a practical measure to reduce tension \r\nregarding one of the thorniest issues facing the world \r\ntoday — that is, ensuring respect for all religions and \r\nbeliefs. We have suggested that an agreement with \r\nlegal provisions be discussed and adopted to prohibit \r\nthe defamation of religions or their sacred symbols. In \r\ndoing so, we will stem the proactive attempts that \r\npoison relations between the adherents of different \r\nreligions under the guise of freedom of expression.  \r\n At a time when many are hailing the spirit of \r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue and the \r\nacknowledgement of diversity, many Muslims around \r\nthe world are experiencing circumstances that are far \r\nfrom celebration or acknowledgement. Wide-ranging \r\nhate campaigns and speech campaigns are sweeping \r\nacross large areas where Islam as a religion is being \r\nattacked and denigrated, where Muslims are facing \r\ninjustice and discrimination. Here I am referring to \r\nIslamophobia. Western institutions monitoring \r\nIslamophobia in Europe are unanimous in reporting \r\nthat this phenomenon is on the rise and that a new form \r\nof discrimination has emerged based on the hatred of \r\nIslam. \r\n I have not evoked this issue as a complaint, but \r\nrather to highlight the relevance and importance of our \r\nmeeting today. When we talk about Islamophobia, we \r\nare not dealing with words but with real facts on the \r\nground. I think everybody agrees that the current tense \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 32 \r\n \r\nrelationship between the Muslim world and the West, \r\ninspired by political, cultural and religious factors, \r\nconstitutes one of the major threats to peace and \r\nsecurity in the world. \r\n In order to address this highly disturbing issue on \r\na political basis as well as on a practical one, I have \r\nrepeatedly called for the urgent need for Islam and \r\nChristianity to agree on an historic reconciliation that \r\nwould bring the two faiths closer together, eliminate \r\nancient grudges and pave the way for a promising \r\nfuture. A few decades ago, we saw this attempt take \r\nplace successfully between Christianity and Judaism. \r\nIn this age of globalization, an historic reconciliation \r\nbetween Islam and Christianity would be an event of \r\nresounding historic proportion, and it would affect \r\nalmost half of humanity. The two great religions of the \r\nworld cannot afford to let their relationship be defined \r\naccording to antiquated, antagonistic paradigms. We \r\nare confident that if we can only manage to clear this \r\nmajor obstacle, the entire world will be safer, more \r\npeaceful and prosperous. \r\n Let us work together to promote peace and social \r\ncohesion. Let us endeavour to foster freedom of \r\nreligion and belief in order to overcome extremism, \r\nstereotypes, prejudice, ignorance and indifference. Let \r\nus be an instrument of God, of peace and of a limitless \r\nocean of love and harmony. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 6.25 p.m. on \r\nFriday, 5 October, and was resumed at 10 a.m. on \r\nMonday, 8 October. \r\n The President: I call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Ruchi Ghanashyam, chairperson of the delegation \r\nof India. \r\n Ms. Ghanashyam (India): India is happy to \r\nparticipate in this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding. As a \r\ncountry that has historically been a confluence of \r\nvarious religions and cultures, India believes that \r\ndialogues of this kind are useful in furthering the \r\nmessage of peace and harmony to which we are all \r\ndeeply committed. \r\n India has a long tradition of supporting the \r\nplurality of beliefs and the individual’s right to follow \r\nhis or her own creed. Freedom of thought and speech is \r\ningrained in the psyche of our nation. It is not \r\nsurprising, therefore, that all the major religions of the \r\nworld can be found in our country. Historically, people \r\npersecuted on grounds of religion in other lands \r\nflocked to India and found safety and freedom to \r\nfollow their faith. The openness of our society is \r\nreflected in the numbers of the largest minority in \r\nIndia, the followers of Islam. With a population of \r\nclose to 150 million Muslims, India has the world’s \r\nsecond largest Muslim population. Hindus, Muslims, \r\nChristians, Sikhs and others have held the highest \r\npositions in the country. \r\n The tolerance of our society emanates from the \r\nbelief that all paths lead to the same destination. \r\nRespect for all religions and cultures is not just a part \r\nof our inheritance and cultural heritage, but was \r\nregarded as an article of faith by the leaders of our \r\nfreedom struggle. It is this commitment that resulted in \r\nthe establishment of a secular and democratic India \r\nafter our independence. The leaders of modern India \r\nremain firmly committed to the ideal of interreligious \r\nand intercultural harmony and coexistence. \r\n It is no coincidence, then, that the General \r\nAssembly unanimously decided, through its resolution \r\n61/271, to observe 2 October, the day on which \r\nMahatma Gandhi was born, as the International Day of \r\nNon-Violence. The first such Day was observed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly through an informal plenary meeting \r\nlast week. \r\n Interreligious and intercultural understanding can \r\nbe promoted through encouraging a culture of \r\ninclusiveness. Democracy and the opportunity for a \r\ndemocratic dialogue make a positive contribution to \r\ninterreligious and intercultural harmony. Nations that \r\nprovide equal opportunity to their citizens and where \r\nsecularism, freedom and democracy reign are \r\nparticularly well placed to promote harmony among \r\ntheir citizens. \r\n Modern scientific education helps the \r\ndevelopment of countries and societies. The skills \r\nacquired by citizens through modern education enable \r\nthem to be gainfully engaged in the process of nation-\r\nbuilding. Education and development also act as \r\nbarriers against extremism and fundamentalism. India \r\nhas a strong tradition of scientific education. Modern \r\nIndia has made great strides in higher education. This \r\neffort needs to be replicated in those parts of South \r\nAsia where curricula continue to focus on antiquated or \r\ndivisive tendencies and where large sections of the \r\neducation system remain devoid of modern systems \r\nand precepts, spawning extremism and fundamentalism. \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n33 07-53011 \r\n \r\n A clear message that this Dialogue should send \r\nout should be an unambiguous rejection of extremism \r\nand violence. Modern societies cannot and should not \r\ntolerate violence. Support by State machinery for \r\nextremism, either deliberate or inadvertent, to serve \r\ninternal or external interests, should be abandoned, and \r\nall States should make determined efforts to prevent \r\nthe spread of extremism, fundamentalism and \r\nterrorism. \r\n The Dialogue that is being held on this subject in \r\nthe General Assembly can be expected to contribute \r\nmeaningfully and positively to the international efforts \r\nto promote interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding only if it proceeds in good faith and \r\nwithout politicization. Attempts to bring in the political \r\nagenda through the back door or to use it for short-term \r\npolitical gains undermine the credibility of the effort \r\nitself. \r\n India supports all sincere efforts to promote \r\ninterreligious and intercultural understanding. In this \r\ncontext, we welcome the appointment of Mr. Jorge \r\nSampaio, former President of Portugal, as the \r\nSecretary-General’s High Representative for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations. We have always been willing \r\nto share from our own experience of centuries of living \r\nin peace and harmony with a multiplicity of religions \r\nand communities.  \r\n In our present modern world, we believe that a \r\nstarting point in the direction of achieving \r\ninterreligious and intercultural understanding would be \r\nfor States to enable the development of a culture of \r\ninclusiveness and tolerance within their own societies. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Andreas Mavroyiannis, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Cyprus. \r\n Mr. Mavroyiannis (Cyprus): Let me begin by \r\nsaying that Cyprus fully subscribes to the statement \r\nmade by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and \r\nCooperation of Portugal on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. We welcome this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding, which \r\nwe consider particularly suited to the United Nations, \r\nwith its global representativity. We do not view this as \r\nan academic exchange of positions; rather, we consider \r\nthat our primary objective should be to relate the kind \r\nof outcome we are seeking through this Dialogue to the \r\npurposes and objectives of the United Nations. \r\n Cyprus is proud to have hosted, in July 2006, in \r\ncooperation with Malaysia, the second Asia-Europe \r\nMeeting Interfaith Dialogue forum, which dealt with \r\nthe issue of interfaith understanding and cooperation \r\nfor a peaceful world. The meeting was successful in \r\nidentifying ways in which people of different faiths can \r\nmove in harmony and understanding to fruitful and \r\nsubstantial cooperation through a solid and permanent \r\ndialogue. \r\n There has been, in recent years, a proliferation of \r\ninitiatives aiming to further cultural and religious \r\ndialogue. We support initiatives that contribute to the \r\ncodification of collective values that all of us can \r\neasily relate to and of which we can claim ownership — \r\nwithout any one culture or religion submerging any \r\nother and without seeking cultural homogeneity at the \r\nexpense of the rich and diverse global heritage that \r\nmakes humankind so interesting.  \r\n We believe that it is only through such dialogue \r\nthat we can identify the overlapping areas in our \r\nrespective beliefs, attitudes and habits. Without \r\ncompromising any elements in our cultures bearing no \r\nresemblance to those of others, this convergence is \r\nwhat will allow us to derive what is universally \r\napplicable and to use it for the common benefit of \r\nhumankind. This involves universal objectives, such as \r\nthe protection of human rights, but also the prevention \r\nof cultural misunderstandings that may hinder the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nother tasks central to the mission of the United \r\nNations. \r\n All of that is, of course, subordinate to the \r\nunconditional respect we all have towards the other \r\nand the absolute right of the other to hold their own \r\nviews and convictions, regardless of our own views \r\nand convictions. This kind of respect also entails the \r\ndesire for knowledge of the other, the integration of an \r\ninternational perspective in education and media, the \r\ndissemination of accurate information about cultures \r\nand religions and, ultimately, the awareness of the \r\ncomplexity and historical depth of notions that may \r\ninitially appear to be incompatible with our own. \r\n Diversity is consubstantial to human nature. The \r\nrichness of human civilization is, to a large degree, \r\nindebted to the dialectical relationship between \r\nreligions and cultures and the interaction between them \r\nin various stages of their history. Through the \r\npromotion of this dialogue, we can increase, \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 34 \r\n \r\nthroughout the world, individual and collective \r\nfreedom, enhance respect for human rights and achieve \r\nfurther economic, as well as political, development. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mohammad Khazaee, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, Mr. President, since this is the first time I am \r\nspeaking before the General Assembly, allow me to \r\ncongratulate you on your election to lead this body and \r\nto assure you of my delegation’s full support and \r\ncooperation with you and your Office during your \r\npresidency. I would also like to thank you for \r\nconvening this Dialogue at such a critical time. \r\n We have gathered here to deliberate the important \r\nissue of interfaith and intercultural dialogue, as \r\nembodied in General Assembly resolution 61/221, of \r\nwhich my country was one of the sponsors. In our \r\nview, we need to foster the idea of dialogue among \r\nreligions, cultures and civilizations. It was in that spirit \r\nthat we held a Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial \r\nMeeting on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity last \r\nmonth in Tehran. \r\n The present meetings are devoted to discussing \r\ntwo lofty causes: interfaith dialogue and cooperation \r\nfor peace. I concur with the view that a mistaken \r\nperception of religion, resulting in a failure to \r\nacknowledge its vibrant role in the individual and \r\nsocial life of humankind, constitutes a dark spot on our \r\ncontemporary history. Without a doubt, human society \r\nneeds a new and deeper understanding of religion in \r\norder to remove ambiguities and misperceptions \r\ncreated by ill-intended attempts to tarnish the image of \r\ndivine religions, and also in order to awaken sleeping \r\nconsciences. Despite strong opposition, religions have \r\nnot remained restricted to the private realm and have \r\nfound their way out into the social and public domain. \r\n We also observe that interfaith understanding and \r\ndialogue have brought about harmony among different \r\nreligions, and have gradually entered a new phase, \r\nresponding to the invitation for cooperation for peace. \r\nIn our view, this trend demonstrates a historic leap for \r\nhuman society to a higher stage of mental maturity. I \r\nvery much hope that this right trend results in paving \r\nthe way for future-leaning interaction among all those \r\nwho seek peace and believe in the prominent place of \r\nreligion. \r\n Peace, solidarity and compassion are indeed the \r\nprincipal teachings of Islam and other divine religions; \r\nIslam promotes and attaches great importance to \r\ndialogue, tolerance and coexistence. Attempts to \r\nattribute hatred, terrorism, dogmatism and extremism \r\nto Islam and its lofty teachings are, in fact, a \r\ndespicable ploy to taint the true face of Islam and its \r\ndivine values. Islam, by meaning and teaching, is a \r\nreligion of peace, and its holy Prophet is the messenger \r\nof mercy, compassion and tolerance. \r\n I am delighted to state that in Iran all followers of \r\nthe divine religions have lived together in peace and \r\nharmony for many centuries. In accordance with our \r\nconstitution, and based on Islamic teachings and \r\nvalues, all Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians are free to \r\npractice their religions. The constitution of Iran has \r\ngranted the representatives of these religions secured \r\nseats in the Iranian parliament. These representatives \r\nenjoy the same rights and privileges as their Muslim \r\ncolleagues. It is thus the principled position of my \r\nGovernment to support all efforts undertaken to \r\npromote dialogue among religions, cultures and \r\ncivilizations. In this regard, the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran held a dialogue with more than 150 \r\nrepresentatives and scholars of Christian and Jewish \r\nfaith on 26 September 2007 in a church in New York. \r\n By the same token, it is highly satisfying to see \r\nthat many international and regional meetings have \r\nbeen held to discuss the underlying issues relating to \r\nthe importance of interfaith dialogue. As we see today, \r\nthis important item has been included in the agenda of \r\nthe General Assembly. Support for interfaith dialogue \r\nand cooperation for peace by the United Nations and \r\nother international organizations, as well as by regional \r\nforums, is indeed an asset. At the same time, \r\nrecognition by the international community of the \r\nreality that views emanating from interfaith dialogue \r\nwill play an essential role in ongoing efforts to build \r\npeace burdens us with yet heavier responsibility. \r\n Common efforts undertaken by the followers of \r\nreligions to spread peace seek a fundamental goal, \r\nnamely, instilling a sense of responsibility in human \r\nsociety. A successful dialogue aimed at realizing peace \r\ndepends on making the necessary arrangements to win \r\npeople’s hearts and minds. In this collective effort, all \r\nsegments of society, including the media and national \r\nleaders, should be addressed and invited to take part in \r\nbringing about lofty human ideals including peace, \r\njustice, solidarity and spirituality. Respect is a \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n35 07-53011 \r\n \r\nprerequisite for dialogue, and dialogue can be held \r\namong those who recognize and respect each other. \r\nTherefore, ignorance and humiliation are, per se, \r\ndetrimental to dialogue. Attempts against a particular \r\nreligion or culture, especially those made in a \r\nrecognized manner, run counter to the very purposes of \r\nour common agreed principles. The Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, as an initiator of the Dialogue among \r\nCivilizations, is more than willing to share its \r\nexperience with other parties that engage in promoting \r\nsimilar or complementary ideas such as interfaith and \r\nintercultural dialogue and cooperation for peace. \r\n At the present time, the unilateral approach to \r\ninternational issues is a bitter reality. Clearly, such an \r\napproach does not seek peace; nor does it forgo any \r\nacts of coercion or threats to achieve its monopolistic \r\ngoals. It is prepared to trample on international law and \r\nabuse international organizations in order to achieve its \r\ngoals. Therefore, a strong presence of an international \r\nforum dedicated to cooperation for peace, on the basis \r\nof religion, is an appropriate response to those who \r\nseek to dominate. We earnestly hope that the idea of \r\ncooperation for peace will lead to a coalition for peace, \r\nas suggested by our President in his address to the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 25 September (see A/62/PV.5). \r\n In our view, the exchange of opinions aimed at \r\nachieving a common perspective for challenging the \r\nhostile approach of certain Powers should figure \r\nprominently among our priorities. Fortunately, the \r\npeace-seeking approach taken by many States as well \r\nas by world public opinion has prepared the ground for \r\nrealizing this priority. I believe that, despite all odds, \r\nwe can surmount the obstacle of unilateralism and \r\ncontinue our journey towards peace by relying on faith, \r\ndetermination, patience and more convergence among \r\nus. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to emphasize the imperative \r\nof using the capacity of all existing initiatives for the \r\nsame purpose of fostering dialogue among religions, \r\ncultures and civilizations. Certain mechanisms need to \r\nbe designed and established to complement all the \r\nwork programmes and action plans. I hope that our \r\nefforts aimed at carrying out the historic mission will \r\nbe crowned with success. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Abderrahim Ould Hadrami, chairman \r\nof the delegation of Mauritania.  \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I wish to express, through you, Mr. President, \r\nthe thanks of my delegation to the Philippines and to \r\nPakistan for the convening of this High-level Dialogue \r\non Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace. \r\n It is self-evident that the world has become a \r\nsmall, but expansive interdependent village with \r\nintertwined scientific, cultural and other interests. This \r\nreality means that the international community must \r\nact as one united family and cooperate prudently and \r\nwisely and make use of the religious, scientific and \r\ntechnological concepts by putting them to good use in \r\nthe service of humankind. We should not, under any \r\ncircumstances, accept that situation as a cause for a \r\nclash of civilizations and religions. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Mauritania conforms \r\nstrictly to its Muslim faith and calls for dialogue and \r\nunderstanding among all humankind to avoid conflicts \r\nand disputes, as was stressed by His Excellency \r\nMr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdellahi, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, in his address to \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session when \r\nsaid he said that  \r\n “encouraging the spirit and values of \r\nunderstanding, dialogue and complementarity \r\nbetween civilizations and nations, upholding the \r\nrule of law and expanding justice and equity are \r\nthe speediest way to ensure peace and security in \r\nthe world and eradicate hatred and confrontation \r\nbetween peoples”. (A/62/PV.6, p. 6)  \r\n Islam is a faith of peace and amity. It is \r\nregrettable that some parties describe it as terroristic \r\nand link it to terrorism. Those who understand the \r\nreligion and its culture know that the first greeting in \r\nthe Islamic world is “peace be upon you”. That \r\nbehaviour reflects a civilized manner of living. Islam \r\nhas never, ever called for extremism or for the \r\nrenunciation of others. It is a faith of harmony, \r\nbrotherhood, amity and respect for others. \r\n The blasphemous cartoons and profanity against \r\nthe Prophet Muhammad and prompt us to use this \r\ndialogue as an opportunity to show respect for the \r\ncultures and faiths of other people and their sanctified \r\nheritage. We call for legislations that prohibits such \r\nprofanity and such portrayals. We urge Member States \r\nto adopt the ideas of the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 36 \r\n \r\nCooperation for Peace and to incorporate them into the \r\ncurricula of schools and universities.  \r\n The people of Mauritania believe in Islam, but we \r\nrespect all other religions and creeds. We consider that \r\npeaceful coexistence among religions and creeds and \r\ncultures would promote international peace, security \r\nand cooperation. Distinguished Mauritanian Muslim \r\nscholars travel around the globe as ambassadors of \r\namity and peace to promote peaceful coexistence \r\namong nations; they participate in many conferences \r\nand meetings on dialogue among cultures and \r\nreligions, in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas to \r\npromote peace, understanding and cooperation among \r\nall nations, religions and cultures. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Martin Belinga-Eboutou, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Cameroon.  \r\n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): By resolution 61/221 of 20 December 2006, \r\nthe General Assembly decided to hold in 2007 a high-\r\nlevel dialogue on cooperation between religions and \r\ncultures. As a sponsor of the resolution, Cameroon \r\nwelcomes this debate, which comes at the right time. \r\nOur world continues to pay a heavy price for its lack of \r\nunderstanding and absence of dialogue. Moreover, in \r\naddition to economic inequality, the world’s peoples \r\nsuffer from the ill effects of intolerance and the \r\nrejection of the other, which are the root causes of all \r\nthe violence and the terror in the world. \r\n Intolerance and the rejection of the other are also \r\nat the root of all of the fanaticism and religious \r\nfundamentalism delivery from monotheistic and other \r\nreligions — which, however, teach the love of one’s \r\nneighbour and love of humankind. Such brotherhood is \r\ndescribed well by Khalil Gibran: \r\n  “You are my brother and I love you. I love \r\nyou worshipping in your church, kneeling in your \r\ntemple, and praying in your mosque. You and I \r\nand all are children of one religion ... [the \r\nreligion of the spirit]”. \r\n Truthfully, the idea of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue is not new. It is enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. It is enshrined in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. It is enshrined in the \r\nConstitution of UNESCO. The idea had a resurgence \r\nfollowing 11 September 2001. That day, the world, in a \r\nstate of shock, found itself again brutally faced with \r\nthe classic question of historical philosophy and that is: \r\nIf we have come this far, then what will our future be, \r\nand what can we hope for? \r\n Journalists, driven by the need for commentary \r\ndusted off the book of Professor Samuel Huntington, \r\nThe Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World \r\nOrder. That book tells us that humanity has entered an \r\nera of conflicts of a new kind. Wars would no longer be \r\nideological, but civilizational, with countries pitted \r\nagainst each other no longer because of economic or \r\npolitical interests, but because they belong to opposing \r\ncivilizations. Different civilizations, cultures and \r\nreligions, we are told, cannot agree on common \r\nprinciples. Thus, they are destined by nature to fight \r\nfor domination. For that reason, wars of civilizations \r\nand wars of culture are inevitable. They can break out \r\nwithin a State between communities which belong to \r\ncivilizations, religions and cultures that are claimed to \r\nbe incompatible. They can also set States with different \r\ncivilizational identities against each other. \r\n That theory drives a culture of the enemy, which \r\nis also a culture of fear. Huntington’s book very \r\nskilfully transforms the fundamental question “What \r\ncan we hope for?” into “Whom should we fear?”. The \r\nonly goal of such fear is to undermine the existence \r\nand the future of multireligious and multicultural \r\nsocieties: we should distrust all of those, within a \r\nsociety who do not belong to the same civilization and \r\nwe will ultimately find that it is impossible to live with \r\nthem. \r\n We, the peoples of the United Nations — who \r\nhad just proclaimed 2000 the International Year for the \r\nCulture of Peace and 2001 the United Nations Year of \r\nDialogue among Civilizations — had to stand up \r\nagainst that culture of fear and against the \r\nglobalization of the enemy. On 20 December 2002, by \r\nresolution 57/249, the General Assembly proclaimed \r\n21 May the World Day for Cultural Diversity for \r\nDialogue and Development. In 2005, the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations initiative was launched. So, the \r\ninternational community — the peoples of the United \r\nNations — responded to the clash of civilizations with \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations. \r\n Today the peoples of the United Nations are \r\nholding this debate, which takes us to the heart of the \r\nmatter: people must learn again to listen to each other, \r\nto accept each other, to accept each other’s diversity — \r\nin short, to become enriched from their mutual \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n37 07-53011 \r\n \r\ndifferences. The same goes for their lives and their \r\nsurvival. \r\n The peoples of the world have a great need to \r\nstrengthen their ability to listen to each other; societies \r\nthat differ culturally and religiously but are equal in \r\ndignity must listen to each other; the rich must listen to \r\nthe needs and desires of the poor for a life of greater \r\nfairness and dignity and for a more equitable division \r\nof the resources of the planet. There is a need to listen \r\nto our own history so that together, by understanding \r\nthe horrors of the past, we will be able to say “never \r\nagain” and above all, to act accordingly. \r\n Here is a complete programme — a programme \r\nthat will lead us to ownership of the values of peace, \r\ntolerance and dialogue. Actions need to be directed to \r\nthat end. In terms of education, we need to promote \r\nknowledge and respect for others and, in that spirit, to \r\nshape the young generations who will be the leaders of \r\ntomorrow’s world. In families, in churches, in mosques \r\nand in synagogues, we must become teachers of peace, \r\nhuman rights and freedom — freedom that respects \r\neach and every human being. \r\n In terms of information and communication, we \r\nmust use the media and new technologies to drive \r\ncomprehension and dialogue among cultures and \r\nreligions, to build a culture of peace and solidarity \r\namong people and to build a society of ever greater \r\nbrotherhood to prepare for the coming of what Saint-\r\nExupéry called “La Terre des Hommes”. \r\n Lastly, the methods and tools of human sciences \r\nmust help to define actions aimed at promoting fruitful \r\ninterreligious and intercultural exchanges.  \r\n Those actions are essential, fundamental and \r\nvital. The idea of a culture of peace based on \r\nunderstanding between religions and cultures \r\ngerminates and grows in each individual conscience. It \r\nis a fragile seed, but in the heart of the man or woman \r\nof peace that value will find fertile ground for \r\ngermination; a tiny seedling, it can find the air it needs \r\nin order to grow in the breath of the man or woman of \r\npeace; a delicate flower, it will find the warmth \r\nnecessary to flourish in the hands of the man or woman \r\nof peace. Once it is accepted by the individual, the \r\nculture of peace will extend within States and between \r\nStates. May we, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has \r\nurged, have the strength to progress towards real \r\ntolerance and non-violence at all levels, from the \r\nindividual to the State.  \r\n Such tolerance and non-violence, whose value we \r\nrecognize, are daily practices in Cameroon — a multi-\r\nethnic nation, but a single nation; a multicultural \r\nnation, but a single nation; a multireligious nation, but \r\na single nation. \r\n From the mosaic of its peoples and cultures and \r\nthe mosaic of the religions practised there, we work to \r\nconsolidate it. E pluribus unum. Yes — from the many, \r\nfrom our great diversity, we shape and derive our unity. \r\nCameroon — which rejects all fanaticism and religious \r\ndogmatism, represents the land of syncretism — a \r\nmessage of coexistence, an ecumenical promise of \r\npeace. \r\n My country’s vision of the dialogue of \r\ncivilizations is that, in the burning desert of religious, \r\nethnic or cultural passions, all men and women will \r\ngather around one point, the oasis of peace, so that \r\ntogether, and by talking with each other, they can \r\nbuild, stone upon stone, stone by stone, stone after \r\nstone, the wellhead from which understanding and \r\nharmony will bubble up. \r\n Peace is built every day. It is the work of each \r\nmoment and all moments. Through constant dialogue \r\nand through respecting and accepting our differences, \r\nwe should all ensure that no sandstorm of passions \r\nburies that edifice which has been so laboriously \r\nconstructed. \r\n We have a moral and political challenge to take \r\nup: to resist any culture of fear and any globalization \r\nof the enemy; we must combat hasty identification. We \r\nknow with certainty that civilizations and cultures are \r\ncompatible because they are not monolithic or \r\nhomogeneous standing in opposition to each other like \r\nblocks of identity. For, their identity is made up of \r\nwhat they have brought to one another, of what they \r\nhave always exchanged, even if it was sometimes \r\npainful. \r\n We need to know that the future of civilizations, \r\nof cultures and religions is not to be found in a closed, \r\nfixed identity. That future lies in the pursuit of those \r\nexchanges, in maintaining that uninterrupted dialogue \r\nwhich seeks nothing other than the unity of humanity, \r\nopen civilizations, open religions, open cultures. We \r\nare immortal. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Desalegn Alemu, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Ethiopia. \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 38 \r\n \r\n Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): Allow me, Sir, to join \r\nother delegates in congratulating you as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \r\nAllow me also to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for organizing this High-level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace, under \r\nagenda item 49 “Culture of Peace”. \r\n The promotion of a culture of peace has become \r\nthe number-one priority of the United Nations and the \r\nworld at large. Peace no longer means the absence of \r\nwar, but rather its promotion and strengthening through \r\ndialogue and cooperation, with the participation of a \r\nvariety of actors at different levels of society. Let us \r\nrecall that in 1998, the United Nations declared the \r\nyears 2001-2010 the International Decade for a Culture \r\nof Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the \r\nWorld and, in 1999, adopted the Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action on the Culture of Peace \r\n(resolution 53/243). \r\n The world is realizing now that there can be no \r\nsustainable development without lasting peace. \r\nInterreligious and intercultural dialogue is thus all the \r\nmore critically essential. It is, therefore, the \r\nresponsibility of each and every one of us to make the \r\nworld a better place for the next generation by building \r\na culture of peace through accommodation of all \r\ninterests and of all groups within every society and in \r\nthe world at large. \r\n Ethiopia is an ethnically diverse country where \r\nmore than 80 nations and nationalities live in peace and \r\nharmony under the aegis and solid guarantees of the \r\nfederal constitution which ensures their absolute \r\nequality and their fundamental rights. It is a country in \r\nwhich the two major world religions, Christianity and \r\nIslam, embrace and accommodate each other as a \r\nunique, or rare, example of interreligious cooperation \r\nand understanding. \r\n In fact, Ethiopia is known historically to have \r\noffered safe haven and shelter to Muslims from across \r\nthe Middle East when they were persecuted in those \r\nearly times when our country was said to have been \r\npart of Christendom. Indeed, not only do Christians \r\nand Muslims live in peace and harmony as distinct \r\ngroups in Ethiopia, but also they intermarry, cohabit \r\nand dine together as a matter of common practice \r\nthroughout most of the country. The ongoing national \r\nefforts to build a new Ethiopia in which every citizen is \r\nproud of being an Ethiopian — not only by the respect \r\nhe receives for his specific identity, culture and \r\nlanguage, but also by the share of what he receives in \r\nterms of the real economic and social wealth of the \r\ncountry — are already bearing promising fruit. \r\n The fast economic and social development now \r\nbeing witnessed in my country is the result of a \r\nconstitutional regime and policy trends that encourage \r\nand ensure equality among all people, particularly \r\namong nations and nationalities, religions and beliefs. \r\nThat is also in perfect harmony with the sacrosanct \r\nprinciple of peaceful coexistence with and mutual \r\nunderstanding among peoples of all other nations, near \r\nand far, which Ethiopia respects, and with which, for \r\nits part, Ethiopia works hard to foster meaningful \r\ncooperation, as enshrined in its federal constitution and \r\nin the foreign affairs and national security policies in \r\nplace now.  \r\n It is within the context of the promotion of a \r\nculture of peace that the people and the Government of \r\nEthiopia decided to celebrate the Ethiopian Millennium \r\nwith the whole world. Accordingly, it is to be recalled \r\nthat by resolution 61/270, under the agenda item on a \r\nculture of peace, the General Assembly recognized the \r\nyear from 12 September 2007 to 11 September 2008 as \r\nthe year commemorating the Ethiopian Millennium and \r\nrecognized its celebration as a unique African \r\noccasion. We believe that this event is a unique \r\nopportunity to create an enabling environment for our \r\ncountry to start its Millennium with the aim of \r\nadvancing socio-economic and political progress. \r\nFurthermore, this event is also aimed at contributing to \r\nthe advancement of world peace and culture.  \r\n It is within the context of this new Ethiopian \r\nMillennium that the people and the Government of \r\nEthiopia are determined to make every effort to enable \r\nthe country to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) in cooperation with their regional and \r\ninternational counterparts, and to make poverty a thing \r\nof the past. An event that coincided with World \r\nEnvironment Day marked the launch of a national \r\nproject designed to bolster the new Ethiopian \r\nMillennium: Two Trees for 2000. Through that project, \r\nevery Ethiopian is planting two indigenous trees in an \r\nattempt to restore the nation’s degraded forest \r\nresources.  \r\n The Ethiopian Millennium event will continue \r\nuntil 15 months from now, during which time several \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n39 07-53011 \r\n \r\nprojects will be implemented. All projects are designed \r\nto renew the commitment of the Ethiopian people in \r\nthe fight against poverty and backwardness, to build up \r\ndemocratic culture and the culture of peace, and to \r\npromote the good image of the country.  \r\n Conflict, violence and war remain the major \r\nchallenges to building a peaceful and prosperous \r\nworld. Accordingly, the process of attaining durable \r\npeace remains without any doubt a daunting task that \r\nrequires a very strong commitment and the full \r\nparticipation of everyone. It is the number-one priority \r\nand an indispensable goal, in order to create a peaceful \r\nworld for our children and future generations, and to \r\nachieve the various development objectives that have \r\nbeen agreed upon. The power is in our hands to make \r\nthe world a better place. That is why this forum — the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace — under the \r\nagenda item entitled “Culture of peace”, is crucially \r\nimportant for us all. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Ms. Elena \r\nMolaroni, chairperson of the observer delegation of the \r\nCouncil of Europe. \r\n Ms. Molaroni (Council of Europe): In our \r\ncapacity as Chair of the thematic group responsible for \r\npreparing the Council of Europe annual exchanges on \r\nthe religious dimension of intercultural dialogue, we \r\nwould like to deliver the following statement on behalf \r\nof the Council of Europe. \r\n The promotion of intercultural dialogue is one of \r\nthe key missions of the Council of Europe, along with \r\nfostering democracy, human rights and the rule of law. \r\nOur organization is therefore firmly committed to \r\nsupporting the initiatives taken by the United Nations \r\nand its subsidiary organs and welcomes the holding of \r\nthis High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace. \r\n Societies worldwide have to meet the challenges \r\nof growing cultural diversity rooted in history and \r\nenhanced by the effects of globalization. In Europe, the \r\ntasks of securing peace, social cohesion, democracy \r\nand respect for cultural diversity have been major \r\npolicy issues since the Second World War. They are \r\nnow priorities shared by all 47 States members of the \r\nCouncil of Europe. \r\n Europe is guided by a political philosophy of \r\ninclusion and complementarity, full protection of the \r\nhuman rights of everyone, effective democracy and \r\ngood governance at all levels. We are determined to \r\nbuild cohesive societies by ensuring fair access to \r\nsocial rights, by fighting exclusion and by protecting \r\nvulnerable social groups. We are taking resolute steps \r\nto adapt our societies to increasing cultural diversity \r\nparticularly in their social, educational, health and \r\ncultural dimensions, because intercultural dialogue will \r\nnot succeed if we do not address the origins of \r\ndiscrimination and marginalization. \r\n We are resolved to ensure that our diversity \r\nbecomes a source of mutual enrichment instead of \r\nconflict. We are convinced that intercultural dialogue \r\nand understanding, together with pluralism and \r\ntolerance, are essential tools for mastering the \r\nchallenge — tools that public authorities at all levels, \r\ncivil society, religious communities, the media, private \r\nenterprise and individuals must learn to use well. \r\n Mahatma Gandhi once said,  \r\n  “I do not want my house to be walled in on \r\nall sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want \r\nthe cultures of all the lands to be blown about my \r\nhouse as freely as possible. But I refuse to be \r\nblown off my feet by any.” \r\n A similarly firm approach to cultural diversity \r\nand dialogue also characterizes the attitude and \r\npolicies of the Governments of our member States. \r\nThey share the conviction that reconciling cultural \r\ndiversity and social cohesion can succeed only if we \r\ncreate social trust and base our policy on common \r\nvalues, particularly universal human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. \r\n The robust European consensus on those values is \r\ndemonstrated by the accumulated and increasingly \r\nfocused instruments of the Council of Europe in this \r\nsphere, including the European Convention on Human \r\nRights and the European Court of Human Rights, as \r\nwell as a long list of other European conventions and \r\nrecommendations. In a few weeks from now, the \r\nCouncil of Europe will publish a white paper on \r\nintercultural dialogue, which will set out in detail the \r\nconceptual basis and perspectives of our policy and \r\nwhich we will be glad to share and discuss with the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Part of Europe’s rich cultural heritage is a range \r\nof religious, as well as secular, conceptions of the \r\npurpose of life. Islam, Judaism and all other faiths \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 40 \r\n \r\nrepresented on our continent, along with the various \r\ndenominations of Christianity, are important parts of \r\nEurope’s past, presence and future. The Council of \r\nEurope regards freedom of thought, conscience and \r\nreligion as one of the foundations of democratic \r\nsociety. \r\n Quite frequently, public opinion regards differing \r\nreligious identities as the real source and trigger of \r\ncultural conflict in modern societies. That view is not \r\nshared by the Council of Europe. However, religious \r\ncommunities themselves can make substantial \r\ncontributions to intercultural dialogue and peace; they \r\nshare the responsibility for promoting mutual \r\nknowledge and understanding. The Council of Europe, \r\nlike other public authorities, must remain neutral in \r\ncultural and religious matters. But since our April 2007 \r\nmeeting in San Marino, we have been encouraging \r\nreligious communities to engage in dialogue and \r\npromote human rights, democracy and the rule of law \r\nand shall continue to do so in the future. \r\n The Council of Europe is part of a growing group \r\nof international institutions committed to intercultural \r\ndialogue. We are in close contact with the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations initiative and the High Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General for the Alliance. We are proud to \r\nhave a partnership with UNESCO, with which we have \r\nagreed to set up the Faro Open Platform, an inter-\r\ninstitutional framework for cooperation in the area of \r\nintercultural dialogue. With a number of other \r\ninstitutions — including for instance, the Arab League \r\nEducational, Cultural and Scientific Organization \r\n(ALECSO) — we jointly promote practical projects in \r\nthe areas of education, culture, heritage and youth. We \r\nare ready to contribute substantially to the European \r\nYear of Intercultural Dialogue 2008, proclaimed by the \r\nEuropean Union. \r\n Those opportunities for cooperation allow us, we \r\nhope, to help advance the worldwide discussion on \r\nintercultural dialogue and understanding and on the \r\nrole of religious and other belief communities for \r\npeace, human rights, democracy and the rule of law. \r\nWe are ready to deepen our involvement in that area \r\nand to strengthen our practical action, and we look \r\nforward to cooperation with many of those present here \r\ntoday. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mrs. Fiamma \r\nArditi di Castelvetere Manzo, chairperson of the \r\nobserver delegation of the Sovereign Military Order of \r\nMalta. \r\n Mrs. Arditi di Castelvetere Manzo (Sovereign \r\nMilitary Order of Malta): The Sovereign Military \r\nHospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes \r\nand of Malta is honoured to take part in this High-level \r\nDialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace and would \r\nlike to express its gratitude to the delegations of \r\nPakistan and the Philippines for promoting this very \r\nspecial event.  \r\n General Assembly resolution 61/221 recognizes \r\nthat, respect for religious and cultural diversity in an \r\nincreasingly globalizing world contributes to \r\ninternational cooperation, promotes enhanced dialogue \r\namong religions, cultures and civilizations and helps to \r\ncreate an environment conducive to the exchange of \r\nhuman experience. \r\n My colleagues are as aware as I am that in a \r\nworld where more and more people of different \r\nreligious and cultural backgrounds are living together \r\nit is crucial that social policies encourage religious and \r\ncultural interaction in a free, respectful environment. \r\nToday, true coexistence between social groups is only \r\npossible if everyone shares fundamental ethical criteria \r\nand is aware that peace begins from within ourselves. \r\n Our world still suffers from war and armed \r\nconflict and is continually wounded by major \r\ninjustices. The third informal thematic debate on \r\n“Civilizations and the challenge for peace: Obstacles \r\nand opportunities”, held here in early May 2007, was a \r\nuseful forum for the Order to examine, among experts, \r\nhow religious differences often worsen the effects of \r\nand are used to justify conflicts. Cultural and religious \r\ninteractions will not survive if we do not respect every \r\nsingle human being. The right to life and to be safe and \r\nthe dignity of the human person are basic ethical values \r\nthat must be universally recognized. \r\n It is precisely that awareness that gives the Order \r\nof Malta confidence to hold its Christian origin and \r\nethos firmly and positively, while reaching out in \r\nservice and in membership to people of other religious, \r\ncultural and ethnic identities. As underlined by our \r\nGrand Master in his address to the diplomatic corps \r\nlast January, members of the Order experience their \r\nfaith not as an instrument of evangelization or \r\nproselytism but as a way of living in the service of \r\nothers, of the poor and the sick, in an authentic spirit of \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n41 07-53011 \r\n \r\nhumanity that recognizes the presence of God in the \r\nperson who suffers, regardless of race, origin or \r\nreligion. \r\n A prudent and sincere dialogue among different \r\ncultures, civilizations and peoples can be carried out \r\nonly in a space where the fundamental rights of men \r\nand women are respected. It is appropriate to recall, in \r\nthe light of the teachings of the second Vatican Council \r\nthe two basic reasons for the struggle by the Catholic \r\nChurch, in close alliance with other Christian churches, \r\nfor the promotion of human rights, and particularly \r\nreligious freedom. These are the dignity of the human \r\nbeing and the necessary interpersonal solidarity based \r\non our universal fraternity. \r\n It is noteworthy that the international community \r\nhas continuously shown interest over the decades in \r\nprotecting human rights and fundamental liberties, \r\nincluding respect for freedom of conscience and of \r\nreligion, in major documents such as: the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights; the International \r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and the \r\nHelsinki Final Act of the Conference on European \r\nSecurity and Cooperation. \r\n A significant cause of interreligious and \r\nintercultural problems which needs to be addressed is \r\nthe social gap between the rich and the poor. In that \r\narea, Governments and religious groups must recognize \r\nthat development, peace and security and human rights \r\nare interlinked. The world’s agenda is also the agenda \r\nof the world’s religions. It is in that spirit that the \r\nCatholic Church emphasizes education and agrees with \r\nother faiths on promoting the integral development of \r\nman and the development of the whole man, according \r\nto the famous statement by Pope Paul VI in the \r\nencyclical Populorum Progressio. \r\n We all know that religious and cultural \r\ninteractions will not bear fruit without a free, respectful \r\nand mindful environment and without the awareness \r\nthat religion is a choice that improves the quality of \r\nour lives, not a weapon against our brothers. We \r\nwelcome the fact that the United Nations has long been \r\ninvolved in the question of the elimination of all forms \r\nof intolerance and discrimination based on religion or \r\nbelief. Far from being the opiate of the people, \r\nauthentic religion places human objectives in true \r\nperspective and stimulates dialogue and respect for \r\nbasic ethical values that are indispensable to \r\ncoexistence among peoples. \r\n If the objectives of the dialogue are to be attained \r\nthere must first be a renewal of attitudes and far-\r\nreaching social change. That will require public and \r\nprivate organizations to gradually align themselves \r\nwith the strengthening and betterment of human \r\nqualities and for the protection of human rights. Those \r\norganizations must dedicate themselves to be at the \r\nservice of the dignity and the well-being of men, \r\nwomen and children through safeguarding basic human \r\nrights under every political and social system in spite \r\nof the considerable effort involved. \r\n It is that sentiment that led the General Assembly \r\nto emphasize in resolution 61/221 the need for all \r\nlevels of society, including the private sector and the \r\nmedia, to become agents for change. That document \r\nencourages efforts to strengthen freedom, justice, \r\ndemocracy, solidarity, cooperation, pluralism, respect \r\nfor diversity of culture and religion or belief, dialogue \r\nand understanding, which are key ingredients for social \r\ncohesion and peace. On our side we must all be aware \r\nthat there is no path to peace. Peace is the path. \r\n To help individuals to carry out more carefully \r\ntheir obligations towards themselves and towards the \r\nvarious groups to which they belong, they must be \r\ncarefully educated to a higher degree of culture \r\nthrough the employment of the immense resources \r\navailable today. Therefore, the Order of Malta \r\ncommends UNESCO for its efforts in fostering the use \r\nof information and communication technologies, such \r\nas community radio, newspapers and the Internet, in \r\ncommunities and schools to promote a culture of peace \r\nand peace education on issues related to non-violence, \r\nmutual understanding and respect. For the more deeply \r\nwe come to understand the ways of thinking of those \r\nwho think and act differently from us in social, \r\npolitical and religious matters, the more easily we will \r\nbe able to enter into dialogue with them.  \r\n Above all, we must undertake the training of \r\nyoung people from all social backgrounds if we are to \r\nproduce the kind of men and women so urgently \r\nneeded today: men and women who not only are highly \r\ncultured but have an open heart and an open mind. \r\n The President: I give the floor to Mr. Michael \r\nSchulz, chairman of the observer delegation of the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies. \r\n Mr. Schulz (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): Mr. President, the \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 42 \r\n \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies (IFRC) welcomes your initiative to \r\nconvene this high-level dialogue. We have taken an \r\nactive part in previous debates on issues relating to the \r\nculture of peace, the broadening of understanding, and \r\nbuilding respect for diversity. In our view, there is a \r\nreal and clear need for this debate and for action at the \r\nnational and local levels. \r\n The Fundamental Principles of the International \r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which guide \r\nthe action of our staff and millions of volunteers \r\nthroughout the world, clearly set out the impartiality, \r\nneutrality and humanity of our approach. They also set \r\nout the universality of our movement, across countries \r\nand communities. \r\n The priorities come from the most basic of human \r\nneeds. Vulnerability is the key and we do not accept \r\nthat legal definitions should ever be allowed to be \r\nimpediments to meeting those needs. The IFRC and its \r\nworldwide network of 186 Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties make no distinction based on religious or \r\nother differences. We, together with our colleagues at \r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross invest a \r\ngreat deal of energy in disseminating the Red \r\nCross/Red Crescent Fundamental Principles. In \r\nparticular, we underline how the principle of \r\nimpartiality ensures that our work is based entirely on \r\npeople’s needs and not on religious affiliation, ethnic \r\ngroupings, class or other distinctions. \r\n We are well aware that in recent years there has \r\nbeen a sharp growth in rhetoric — and in some cases \r\naction — based on fundamentalist beliefs. In some \r\ncommunities we have also seen misunderstandings \r\nabout the nature of our humanitarian work and our \r\nmotives. Concerned by those dangerous trends, the \r\nIFRC recently hosted a specialist think tank bringing \r\ntogether representatives of national societies in \r\ndifferent parts of the world, the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross, as well as several high-\r\nlevel experts in religious dialogue. \r\n The think tank sought to analyse the impact of \r\nchanging religious manifestations in social and \r\npolitical contexts and the implications for impartial \r\nhumanitarian organizations such as our own. The think \r\ntank also sought to consider how the Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent Movement can, in today’s environment, \r\nbetter reach its goal of alleviating human suffering and \r\nensuring respect for diversity and non-discrimination. \r\n In consideration of time constraints, allow me to \r\njust share four key points. First, organizations and their \r\nprogrammes have to be inclusive and representative of \r\nall members of the community. It is essential that all \r\norganizations that are committed to objectives \r\nsurrounding interreligious and intercultural dialogue be \r\nthemselves composed of the different groups whose \r\ndialogue they are fostering. In many communities Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent volunteers and youth activities \r\nprovide the forum for people from different walks of \r\nlife or from different religious or cultural backgrounds \r\nto come together to deliver assistance and services to \r\nthose who need help.  \r\n As for the second key point, dialogue needs to be \r\naccompanied by action. We speak a lot — as we are \r\ndoing again today at the United Nations — about \r\ndialogue. And dialogue is clearly important. Our \r\nexperience is, however, much more action-oriented. We \r\nknow, for example, that to be effective, a health \r\nprogramme must take into consideration attitudes that \r\nenable the whole community to participate and benefit. \r\nSometimes the attitudes which have to be addressed \r\nderive from religious traditions, and in those situations \r\nit becomes imperative to work closely with community \r\nand religious leaders committed to addressing \r\nvulnerabilities without discrimination.  \r\n We also know that dialogue can enable our \r\naction. Our experience shows, for example, that \r\naddressing HIV in some communities must be \r\naccompanied by a dialogue with religious leaders and \r\ninstitutions which can help reach out to the whole \r\ncommunity at risk. \r\n Thirdly, there is a need for high-level engagement \r\nwith Governments, including local government, which \r\nwe believe have a central role to play. By working with \r\ncommitted community-based partners, including Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies, Governments can \r\nbetter engage local communities and initiate a process \r\nthat brings together key actors capable of building \r\nmutual respect. Partnership is essential. We know that \r\nwe need to establish stronger links to religious leaders. \r\nWe also know that we must undertake a dialogue with \r\ninfluential local personalities, including the media, to \r\nemphasize the value of working together in harmony \r\nfor mutual benefit. \r\n The fourth and the last key point I will make is \r\nthat existing guidelines are adequate. We see no need \r\nfor new rules. There are already many useful \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n43 07-53011 \r\n \r\ninstruments in place to guide humanitarian action in \r\nthis regard. But we acknowledge that improved \r\nimplementation of already agreed guidelines would be \r\na valuable action in itself. In our case, the Code of \r\nConduct for the International Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Movement and Non-governmental \r\nOrganizations in Disaster Relief sets important \r\nstandards in this area. We are convinced that it is a \r\ncommendable tool for Governments as well. \r\n We will remain closely connected to this debate. \r\nWe believe that the Red Cross and Red Crescent and its \r\nfundamental principles offer a way ahead for other \r\nconcerned organizations, and we would like to work \r\nwith the Assembly to that end. An early opportunity to \r\nassess the way that partnerships can be built in this \r\narea will be the thirtieth International Conference of \r\nthe Red Cross and Red Crescent, which will be held in \r\nGeneva from 26 to 29 November 2007.  \r\n We were pleased to note the Secretary-General’s \r\nrecent appointment of former Portuguese President \r\nSampaio as his High Representative for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. We look forward to working closely with \r\nhim and all others on these issues, as well as with the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on interreligious dialogue \r\nappointed by the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights.  \r\n The Assembly can count on the continued \r\ncommitment of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in \r\ntackling these crucial issues together. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Yahya Mahmassani, chairman of the \r\nobserver delegation of the League of Arab States. \r\n Mr. Mahmassani (League of Arab States) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): Promoting interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue for peace and strengthening the principles of \r\njustice and dignity among all nations and peoples in a \r\nworld where there is more dialogue, interaction and \r\nunderstanding among all peoples and where \r\ntechnological progress is moving at an accelerated pace \r\nrequires removing barriers between human beings and \r\nmaking good use of globalization in order to build \r\nbridges between religions and civilizations for the \r\nbenefit of present and future generations. Our efforts \r\ntoday to promote understanding and cooperation \r\namong all religions and cultures require the \r\nparticipation of all Governments and regional \r\norganizations. In addition, the private sector and civil \r\nsociety institutions must also have a central role in \r\npromoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue \r\nbased on the initiatives undertaken by important \r\nforums of the United Nations system — including the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations initiative, which aims at \r\nclosing the gap between cultures and religions and at \r\naddressing the world’s current religious and cultural \r\npolarization. That initiative has the support of the Arab \r\nLeague, which has great hopes for the implementation \r\nof the Alliance’s plan of action. That plan includes a \r\nnumber of important activities that will contribute to \r\nbringing cultures closer together. \r\n Promoting dialogue on interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation for peace \r\nalso requires that we recognize and strengthen cultural \r\ndiversity at the national and international levels in \r\norder to ensure the right of peoples and societies to \r\nself-determination and to the preservation of cultural \r\nand religious identity on the basis of tolerance, respect \r\nfor diversity and intercultural dialogue. \r\n In addition, genuine partnership between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations requires \r\ndialogue among world cultures and civilizations in the \r\ncontext of a comprehensive strategy that gives a central \r\nrole to cultures and religions in order to maintain \r\ncontacts and dialogue among peoples. This must be \r\ndone on the basis of mutual respect and understanding \r\nand the promotion of international peace and security. \r\nIn the modern age, the imperative of dialogue with \r\nothers is more urgent than ever. This requires engaging \r\nin dialogue under very complex international \r\nconditions that, more than ever, call for dialogue \r\namong nations to establish new international relations \r\nthat give priority to the principles of peace, mutual \r\nrespect and the right to be different. It also requires \r\nconfronting the doctrines of coercion and dominance.  \r\n We live in a time when we cannot ignore the need \r\nto give the greatest priority to the issue of \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue on \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace, given the \r\nproblems afflicting the modern world that cast long \r\nshadows over international peace, security and \r\nstability. Given the importance of this issue, it must be \r\nkept on the international agenda and sufficient time \r\nmust be devoted to it, in order that all points of view \r\nmay be expressed. In order to ensure that the dialogue \r\nis genuine, effective and positive and has the support \r\nof the entire world, it must be based on the principles \r\nof equality and the acceptance of others — with all \r\ntheir cultural specificities and attributes — while \r\nA/62/PV.19  \r\n \r\n07-53011 44 \r\n \r\nrespecting their values and eliminating stereotypes and \r\nrejecting the dominance of one culture over another. \r\nThe Alliance of Civilizations is in fact an alliance \r\namong all humankind intended to build a better future \r\nfor all in which there is understanding among cultures \r\nand religions and where everyone has an opportunity to \r\nlive a life of dignity free from attempts to exploit \r\nreligion to widen the gap among religions and cultures \r\nin order to achieve political aims and interests. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe High-level Dialogue. \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The President: I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating all participants on the stimulating \r\ndiscussions that we have had over the past two days. In \r\nparticular, I would like to thank our panellists and \r\nrepresentatives from civil society, non-governmental \r\norganizations, faith groups and the private sector for \r\nenriching the debate. We must now go forth \r\ncollectively and strive to build a new culture of \r\ninternational relations based on human rights and \r\nsecurity, mutual cooperation and respect for \r\ninternational law. The High-Level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace is an important avenue to \r\nachieve that goal. \r\n We have already taken an important step in that \r\ndirection by adopting the Declaration on the Rights of \r\nIndigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295). In doing so, \r\nwe have recognized the inherent value of human \r\ndiversity. The spirit of cooperation and mutual respect \r\nthat was displayed during the High-level Dialogue is \r\nsomething that the General Assembly can continually \r\nstrive to exemplify. As we witnessed during the debate, \r\nsincere dialogue is an extraordinary tool to promote \r\ninclusiveness. During this session and beyond, we \r\nshould demonstrate our sincere willingness to tolerate \r\nall views, to search for common ground and to avoid \r\nusing platforms such as this for political purposes. \r\n Globalization has brought us all closer together \r\nand has made us aware of religious and cultural \r\ndiversity. It has also exposed the differences between \r\nus. One consequence of this has been to “exoticize” \r\ndifference. Another has been the exploitation of \r\nreligion for political ends, often with violent \r\nconsequences. As one participant noted, “Unless \r\nreligions are part of the solutions, they will continue to \r\nbe part of the problem”. \r\n Without exception, all speakers recognized that \r\ninterfaith and intercultural understanding forms the \r\nbedrock of our social well-being, stability and \r\nprosperity. Diversity is an inherent part of human \r\ncivilization. Programmes to establish uniformity \r\naround a particular ideology, religious or otherwise, \r\nhave all failed. During the debate we heard many \r\nexamples of different religious communities that have \r\nlived in harmony over the centuries. \r\n Many also noted that intolerance, disrespect and \r\nextremism were on the rise and linked this to \r\nunresolved international conflicts, social and economic \r\ninjustice. In this regard, a number of participants called \r\non the international community to do more to find \r\nsustainable solutions to conflicts in the Middle East, \r\nDarfur, Iraq and Kosovo, noting that lasting peace can \r\nbe achieved by promoting better intercultural and \r\ninterfaith understanding. \r\n Many also called for the full and timely \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand the strengthening of human rights institutions. \r\nExtremists and terrorists who further their political \r\ninterests by misinterpreting religion were denounced \r\nby all. As well as spreading violence, those groups and \r\nindividuals also spread ignorance and \r\nmisunderstanding. Similarly, several delegations also \r\nnoted the conflation of ethnic identity and national \r\nidentity or citizenship as a tool used to spread \r\ninstability for political ends. \r\n The prominent role of mass media was \r\nacknowledged as an essential element in promoting \r\ngreater interreligious and intercultural understanding. \r\nIn this regard, many noted that there was an important \r\nbalance to be struck between freedom of expression \r\nand the responsibility of the media to respect cultural \r\nand religious sensitivities. \r\n A number of delegations have put concrete \r\nproposals on the table to address these and other issues. \r\nI do not have the time to do justice to all these \r\nrecommendations now. However, they are recorded in \r\nparticipants’ written statements, which will be \r\navailable on the United Nations website. \r\n I was honoured to open the interactive hearing of \r\nthe General Assembly, which allowed for an open \r\ndiscussion with distinguished representatives of civil \r\n A/62/PV.19\r\n \r\n45 07-53011 \r\n \r\nsociety, including from non-governmental \r\norganizations, academia, foundations and the private \r\nsector. I would again like to thank and acknowledge all \r\nthose who participated in the hearing, in particular for \r\ndrawing our attention to practical measures to advance \r\ninterreligious and intercultural understanding and \r\ncooperation. The focus on programmes for youth, \r\nmedia and education, as well as innovative \r\npartnerships with the United Nations, coincided with \r\nmany of the views expressed by Member States. \r\nRecommendations such as adapting school curricula \r\nand teacher training to emphasize multicultural \r\nknowledge and awareness were stressed, as well as \r\nincreasing opportunities for international student \r\nexchange programmes. Another important message, as \r\nwe approach the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, is to promote respectful \r\nand inclusive dialogue, especially for minority \r\ncommunities. \r\n I was particularly interested to note the various \r\nconcrete experiences of successful dialogues on the \r\nground that involved parties, with credibility and trust \r\nat the grass roots. Some of these were made possible \r\nthrough effective collaboration with the private sector. \r\nSystematically collecting and disseminating these best \r\npractices would further our efforts and enhance \r\ncoordination. I was encouraged by the significant \r\nparticipation of Member States in yesterday’s hearing, \r\nand welcome the interest of the General Assembly in \r\ncontinuing that meaningful interaction with civil \r\nsociety on this issue and others. \r\n It is clear that there is much more that unites us \r\nthan divides us. As the chairman of the delegation of \r\nPakistan noted, the Holy Koran says that ethnic \r\ndiversity is only for the sake of identity. No matter \r\nwhat religion, creed or culture, the human family \r\nshares a common yearning for peace, prosperity and \r\nhappiness. Open and sustained dialogue and respect for \r\nfreedom of expression and religious belief are \r\nfundamental to our endeavour to promote a culture of \r\npeace.  \r\n Religion is, and should be, a source of inspiration \r\nto achieve these goals. No religion has a superior claim \r\nto truth. We all need to acknowledge and respect the \r\npluralism of views and beliefs that exist. These values \r\nare enshrined in the founding Charter of the United \r\nNations and, if fully implemented, would establish a \r\nnew culture of international relations based on peace, \r\ntolerance and mutual respect. \r\n While the United Nations is an excellent forum \r\nfor dialogue, we must not stop here. If we want to \r\npromote this dialogue, we should go back and spread \r\nthe message in our communities and neighbourhoods \r\nthroughout the world. We should all become examples \r\nof tolerance and mutual understanding in our daily \r\nlives. \r\n If we want the world to change, we must first \r\nembody the change that we want to see in the world. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded High-\r\nlevel dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace, and this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 49. \r\nThe meeting rose at 11.35 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
