(Botswana) \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Outlule \r\n(Botswana), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 11.40 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 109 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/62/1) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Secretary-General presented his first annual report \r\n(A/62/1) to the General Assembly at the 4th plenary \r\nmeeting, on 25 September 2007. \r\n Mr. Akram (Pakistan): The delegation of \r\nPakistan would like to express its appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his first annual report (A/62/1) \r\non the work of the Organization. We expressed our \r\nposition on the substantive issues covered in the report \r\nduring the general debate. Today, I wish to focus on the \r\nrole of the United Nations itself in current international \r\nrelations. \r\n We are living in an increasingly globalized and \r\ninterdependent world — a world confronted with \r\ncomplex challenges as well as opportunities for war \r\nand peace, poverty and prosperity, coercion and \r\ncooperation, and terrorism and tolerance. The world — \r\nboth States and peoples — can respond effectively to \r\nthose challenges and grasp the opportunities only if \r\nthey work collectively and cooperatively within the \r\nsole universal Organization, namely, the United \r\nNations. The world Organization has the mandate, the \r\nmembership and the mechanisms to promote the \r\ncooperative multilateralism that is so indispensable for \r\npeace, prosperity and survival at the dawn of the \r\ntwenty-first century. However, it is quite evident that \r\nthe United Nations has thus far been unable to \r\neffectively address the challenges or to exploit the \r\nopportunities. The full potential of the Organization \r\nremains to be fulfilled. \r\n To realize that potential, Member States must \r\nreconcile their conflicting visions of the purpose and \r\nfunctions of the United Nations. The Organization is \r\nnot an instrument to serve the unilateral objectives and \r\ninterests of any Power. It is also not a mechanism to \r\noperate an oligarchic order of multipolar power \r\nrelations. The United Nations, as envisaged in the \r\nCharter, is a venue and vehicle for the promotion of \r\nmultilateral cooperation as a means to promote peace, \r\nsecurity and better standards of life in larger freedoms \r\nfor all peoples. The Organization was created for all its \r\nMember States and all their peoples. It must be \r\nresponsive to their interests and reflect their goals and \r\naspirations. \r\n From the perspective of the majority of small and \r\nmedium-sized States, a singular shortcoming of the \r\nUnited Nations is the uneven treatment of issues, \r\ncatering to the interests and sensitivities of big Powers \r\nand ignoring those of small countries. That inequality \r\nof treatment is especially evident in the field of peace \r\nand security. That is evident in the Middle East, where \r\nthe views of the majority of the membership of the \r\nUnited Nations are not reflected either in the decisions \r\nof the Security Council or the pronouncements of the \r\nSecretariat. It is also evident from the omission from \r\nA/62/PV.20  \r\n \r\n07-53213 2 \r\n \r\nthe annual report of any reference to the volatile region \r\nof South Asia and the central dispute over Jammu and \r\nKashmir, which has plagued relations in that region for \r\nsix decades. It is further evident in the one-sided \r\napproach of the United Nations to issues such as \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, as well as human \r\nrights. \r\n To ensure greater equity, it seems essential to \r\nrebalance the powers of the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The Security Council should restrict \r\nits role to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, and not encroach on the functions of other \r\norgans. Its proceedings and work should be open and \r\ntransparent. Its composition should be more \r\nrepresentative of the general membership, to whom the \r\nSecurity Council is ultimately accountable. As the \r\nSecretary-General noted in his report, the main \r\nrecommendation of the reports of the facilitators last \r\nyear was an intermediate approach as a compromise \r\nsolution with a view to unblocking the process of \r\nreforming the Security Council. We endorse that view \r\nand approach as the most feasible. As recommended by \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of \r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nRelated to the Security Council, we should seek to \r\nbuild on the progress that was achieved at the sixty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly. \r\n At the same time, the General Assembly must \r\nassert its authority under the Charter, including in \r\naddressing peace and security in areas where the \r\nSecurity Council is unwilling or unable to act. Pakistan \r\nhas suggested several concrete steps to empower the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We hope to secure wide support for \r\nthose suggestions during the current session, especially \r\nfrom small and medium-sized States. \r\n It is also evident that we can considerably \r\nenhance the role of the United Nations in the area of \r\nconflict prevention and dispute resolution. There is \r\nample scope under Chapter VI of the Charter for the \r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the International Court of Justice to \r\npromote solutions to various conflicts and disputes \r\namong Member States through the mechanisms of \r\nconciliation, mediation, arbitration and good offices. \r\nThe United Nations should pursue such a role as an \r\nobligation, not a favour to one or more of the parties to \r\na dispute. In that context, we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s desire to strengthen the United Nations \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs. \r\n The prevention of conflict and its recurrence can \r\nalso be achieved by strengthening the newly \r\nestablished Peacebuilding Commission. Although the \r\nCommission has made a good beginning with the \r\nconsideration of Burundi and Sierra Leone, Pakistan is \r\ndisappointed that its full potential remains constrained, \r\nin particular owing to defence of the Security Council’s \r\nprerogatives by some of its permanent members and \r\nthe somewhat facile approach of some who perceive \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission as merely another \r\nmechanism for donors and recipients. \r\n In recent years, peacekeeping has emerged as a \r\nUnited Nations success story. As the United Nations \r\nlargest troop contributor, Pakistan is particularly \r\nsatisfied with that success. There is now a surge in \r\ndemand for United Nations peacekeepers; but with \r\n100,000 already deployed, the United Nations may \r\nsoon face difficult capacity problems in responding to \r\nnew demands for peacekeepers. The United Nations \r\nmust also remain cautious in committing peacekeepers \r\nin situations where there may not be any peace to keep. \r\nNor should the United Nations become an instrument \r\nfor unwanted foreign intervention in the internal affairs \r\nof States. \r\n Many conflicts and disputes, especially within \r\nStates, arise from the politics of scarcity. Poverty and \r\nhunger aggravate and ignite political, ethnic and \r\nreligious differences. Growing poverty is spreading \r\nwar in developing countries, as much as are the illegal \r\nexploitation of natural resources and arms smuggling. \r\nThere should be greater focus on the role of economic \r\nand social development as a cost-effective approach to \r\npreventing conflicts and tensions in and among the \r\nmost vulnerable countries. The Economic and Social \r\nCouncil should be entrusted with that mandate. \r\n The United Nations must restore the credibility of \r\nthe quest for non-proliferation and disarmament. The \r\nconsensus on disarmament and non-proliferation has \r\neroded, due in particular to the refusal of the major \r\nPowers to disarm, the negligence regarding the security \r\nconcerns of other States and the application of \r\ndiscriminatory standards to different States. South Asia \r\nin particular may, as a result, witness an escalation of \r\nan arms race unless a discriminatory approach is \r\navoided. Pakistan has proposed the convening of an \r\ninternational conference to evolve a new and balanced \r\n A/62/PV.20\r\n \r\n3 07-53213 \r\n \r\nconsensus on disarmament and non-proliferation. We \r\nencourage the Secretary-General to explore the \r\npossibility of convening such a conference. \r\n Apart from peace and security, the United \r\nNations has a principal role under the Charter to \r\npromote economic and social development. We are \r\nglad that the Secretary-General has accorded high \r\npriority to the development agenda. We believe that in \r\nour interdependent and globalized world, the \r\ndevelopmental role of the United Nations is more \r\nessential than ever. This United Nations role has three \r\ndimensions, the first being policy formulation and the \r\nnegotiation of norms, agreements and commitments, \r\nthe second being development cooperation, including \r\nthe United Nations system’s operational activities for \r\ndevelopment, and the third being the monitoring and \r\nimplementation of the agreed upon goals and \r\ncommitments. \r\n In the general debate in the Second Committee, \r\nPakistan, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, will \r\noutline a series of proposed actions to advance the \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\n The 2005 Summit declared human rights as the \r\nthird pillar of the United Nations. This pillar can be \r\nstrong only if the other two pillars, security and \r\ndevelopment, are equally strong. The replacement of \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights with the Human \r\nRights Council has not yet changed the culture of \r\npolitical confrontation that has plagued this field. \r\nThere is hope that the consensus reached on the \r\npackage of decisions relating to the agenda and \r\nprocedures of the new Council may lead to a more \r\nobjective and judicious approach to human rights and \r\ncreate the climate and working methods to ensure \r\npositive outcomes in work of the Council. It would be \r\nironic indeed if those who proposed this Council were \r\nnow to spurn and reject it. At the same time, the Office \r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be \r\nreminded that it is part of the Secretariat of the United \r\nNations and is not an independent entity. Its work \r\nprogramme, staffing and operations must be reviewed \r\nand approved by the Human Rights Council before \r\nsubmission to the General Assembly. \r\n Finally, the Secretariat of the United Nations also \r\nrequires review, renewal and reform. We have broadly \r\nsupported the various United Nations reform proposals \r\nundertaken in recent years. We are willing to consider \r\nfurther reforms in procurement, accountability, \r\nadministration of justice, enterprise resource planning, \r\nand human resources. However, it must be said that the \r\nSecretariat cannot be expected to discharge the \r\nadditional responsibilities that are being assigned to it \r\nwhile Member States at the same time insist on zero \r\ngrowth in the budget of the United Nations. The \r\nresources provided to the United Nations should be \r\ncommensurate with its mandate, not the other way \r\naround. \r\n We believe that, to be really effective, the United \r\nNations management and administrative reforms \r\nshould be pursued with a strategic vision and in a \r\ncomprehensive manner. The Four Nations Initiative, \r\nincluding the recommendations of their Report, offers \r\nan approach which could hold promise for such a \r\ncomprehensive and strategic reform of the United \r\nNations management and administration. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I wish to express Egypt’s appreciation for the \r\nfirst report on the work of the Organization presented \r\nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon since his \r\nassumption of office. I wish to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General for the clarity of his assessments and \r\nthe commendable ambition of the proposals he has put \r\nforward to address international challenges in a manner \r\nthat further strengthens the credibility of the \r\nmultilateral work conducted at the United Nations. \r\n I would like to depart from my text by supporting \r\nwhat the representative of Pakistan had to say on the \r\nimportance of strengthening the role of the United \r\nNations in the peaceful settlement of chronic conflicts. \r\nWe should not be content with addressing these issues \r\noutside the framework of the Organization, especially \r\nas regards the Arab-Israeli conflict. \r\n We are all in agreement with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that reform is not in itself the ultimate goal but \r\nrather is the means to facilitate overcoming the \r\nobstacles that thwart the attainment of agreed goals. \r\nEgypt also values the focus put by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the implementation of international \r\nobligations — particularly those pertaining to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) — attaching \r\ndue priority to the African continent, as the only \r\ncontinent for which the realization of most of the Goals \r\nremains a distant prospect. We therefore look forward \r\nto seeing the Secretary-General transform his visions in \r\nthat regard into concrete proposals to be put before the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nA/62/PV.20  \r\n \r\n07-53213 4 \r\n \r\n Having said that, we reiterate the central \r\nimportance of receiving proposals from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in all areas of development, especially in that \r\nof social development, which did not receive an \r\nadequate share of attention in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport. It is well known that health, education and \r\nemployment are polar opposites of disease, epidemics, \r\nunemployment and immigration, and that success and \r\nfailure in these areas depend on a whole range of \r\ninternal and external factors requiring the United \r\nNations to muster the necessary support of the \r\ninternational community for the creation of an \r\ninternational environment conducive to and supportive \r\nof efforts of developing countries to realize the MDGs, \r\nfor which trade, debt cancellation and financing for \r\ndevelopment are key. \r\n Egypt, as a middle-income country, believes that \r\nthe United Nations should remain focused on the \r\naforementioned causes, as middle-income countries are \r\nhome to the biggest number of poor people globally, \r\nwhich means that they require economic and social \r\nsupport if they are to achieve their development goals \r\nat the national level and in their regional context. \r\n This requires the implementation of pledges made \r\nby donors at the Monterrey, Gleneagles and \r\nHeiligendamm Summits, whether they are related to \r\nAfrica or to fighting disease, especially HIV/AIDS and \r\nmalaria. It also requires the implementation of the \r\nSecretary-General’s request concerning the provision \r\nby donors to recipient countries during 2007 and 2008 \r\nand up to 2010 of timelines for aid increase until 2010, \r\nso that the countries can integrate such data when \r\npreparing national budgets and developmental projects. \r\nWe wish to learn of the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in this regard, including the possibility of the \r\nestablishment of an implementation follow-up \r\nmechanism. \r\n As regards the issue of climate change, the High-\r\nlevel Event on this subject has reflected the ever-\r\ngrowing importance attached to it by the international \r\ncommunity and to its negative impact on developing \r\ncountries. Accordingly, as mentioned in the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General, an increased collective effort on \r\nthe part of the international community is called for to \r\nlimit phenomena related to climate change through the \r\nupholding and implementing of decisions taken at the \r\nEarth and Johannesburg Summits and based on the \r\nthree pillars of sustainable development. This \r\nnecessitates the strengthening of the role of the United \r\nNations in implementing mandates decided upon by \r\nMember States, without seeking their reinterpretation \r\nand without adjusting the priorities of the \r\nOrganization. Preserving international democratic \r\ndecision-making, anchored in the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations, necessitates involving \r\nMember States in open, transparent and inclusive \r\ndecision-making processes. \r\n The delegation of Egypt commends the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations to provide relief assistance to those \r\naffected by natural disasters. Egypt has contributed to \r\nthe Central Emergency Response Fund since its \r\nestablishment, and we also contribute to the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. Both funds are examples of \r\nsuccess in the international community’s joint efforts to \r\nserve humanity. We believe that those examples should \r\nbe maintained and built upon so that we can achieve \r\nsimilar successes in other areas. \r\n If reform is to be effective, it is essential that the \r\nSecretariat maintain its impartiality, transparency and \r\naccountability and that it avoid addressing \r\ncontroversial issues as if they were objects of \r\nconsensus. One example is the responsibility to protect. \r\nWe decided at the 2005 World Summit that the General \r\nAssembly would continue to discuss the responsibility \r\nof Governments and States to protect their nationals, \r\nwithout introducing the concept of the international \r\ncommunity’s responsibility to protect peoples from \r\ntheir own Governments, which would represent \r\nintervention in States’ internal affairs. \r\n As we discuss this issue, our objective should \r\nremain enhancing the Organization’s role in the \r\nimplementation of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights — whose sixtieth anniversary we are \r\ncelebrating — and to ensure compliance with the \r\nGeneva Conventions, particularly the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention, relative to the protection of civilian \r\npersons in time of war. We consider the Geneva \r\nConventions to be the fundamental pillars of the \r\ninternational community’s responsibility to protect \r\npeoples — particularly to protect those living in \r\ncountries under foreign occupation or countries where \r\nforeign forces are present in any context from the \r\nperils and merciless practices associated with such \r\noccupation or occupiers. \r\n In the area of peacekeeping and peacebuilding, \r\nwe support all efforts by the United Nations to build its \r\ncapacity to serve as an international mediator in order \r\n A/62/PV.20\r\n \r\n5 07-53213 \r\n \r\nto help prevent political tensions from erupting into \r\nintra- or inter-State conflicts, thus reinforcing its role \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nWhile we have strongly supported the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals aimed at restructuring the \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations to maximize \r\nthe effectiveness of the Organization’s presence in \r\nconflict areas, we do not welcome the proposed \r\ninitiatives on intervention to reform State security \r\nsectors and systems, because we believe that such \r\nmatters are within the purview of State sovereignty and \r\nnational constitutions. \r\n With regard to respect for State sovereignty and \r\ninternational constitutional frameworks, we welcome \r\nthe Organization’s efforts to help Member States build \r\ntheir capacity to protect human rights in a cooperative, \r\nrather than confrontational, manner. Accordingly, we \r\nsupport the central role played by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in strengthening respect for human rights at \r\nthe international level. We invite the Secretary-General \r\nand his Special Representative on the situation of \r\nhuman rights defenders to refrain from criticizing the \r\nCouncil’s decisions in the context of mutual respect for \r\nthe balance of authority, as required by the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. We believe it is essential to ensure \r\nsuch a balance in the relationship among the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, as well as in the relationship between \r\nthe Secretariat and those main organs. \r\n At the same time, we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s essential role in supporting the initiative of \r\nthe dialogue among civilizations, cultures and \r\nreligions, particularly his efforts to counter campaigns \r\nthat seek to distort the religious and cultural beliefs of \r\npeoples as well as the ferocious campaigns targeting \r\nIslam and its adherents in many parts of the world, \r\nincluding those linking Islam with terrorism, and the \r\nfalse claims made against its prophets and messengers. \r\n All Member States attach particular importance to \r\nreform of the Security Council and expansion of its \r\nmembership. While the facilitators’ reports concluded \r\nthat interim arrangements might represent a consensus \r\nsolution aimed at making progress on this issue, \r\nMember States have not yet agreed on that approach, \r\nand those reports merely listed the reform proposals \r\npresented by various parties. Member States are \r\nwaiting for a State or group of States to submit a draft \r\nresolution reflecting that or any other approach. Egypt \r\nwill consider any proposal that has the potential to \r\nfulfil the aspirations of the African continent. We \r\ncontinue to support the Ezulwini Consensus as an \r\nindivisible package that must retain all of its elements, \r\nparticularly the power of the veto for new permanent \r\nmembers. \r\n In the same context, I wish to welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s approach to overcoming the \r\ndifficulties that are preventing the United Nations from \r\nplaying a vital and fundamental role in the field of \r\ndisarmament. The delegation of Egypt looks forward to \r\nconcrete proposals from the Secretary-General aimed \r\nat invigorating the Organization’s role in this area — \r\nparticularly following his excellent proposal to \r\ntransform the post of Under-Secretary-General for \r\nDisarmament Affairs into a Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General for Disarmament — that we can \r\novercome the impasse in nuclear and conventional \r\ndisarmament and address the issue of the illicit spread \r\nof small arms and light weapons and its negative \r\neffects on international peace and security. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): Permit \r\nme to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, on the effective and appropriate \r\nmanner in which he is leading the debates and \r\nactivities of the Assembly. I also wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for drafting and submitting his \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/62/1) and to \r\ncommend him for the work he has accomplished during \r\nhis mandate. \r\n Seven years have passed since our heads of State \r\nor Government pledged to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Although progress has \r\nbeen made towards those objectives, we are concerned \r\nat how far away a significant number of countries \r\nremain from such an achievement. \r\n The African continent continues to face serious \r\nchallenges in making sustained progress that will \r\nenable them to achieve the MDGs within the time \r\nframe established in 2000. We recognize the \r\nimportance of the work of the Organization in that \r\nregion. At the same time, we wish to emphasize the \r\nrole of the United Nations and of the international \r\ncommunity in general in addressing the priorities and \r\nneeds of middle-income countries. \r\n In the area of international cooperation, Member \r\nStates must meet their official development assistance \r\ncommitments and must guarantee broad and equitable \r\naccess to international markets. My country calls for \r\nA/62/PV.20  \r\n \r\n07-53213 6 \r\n \r\nthe continued and active incorporation of modalities \r\nsupporting South-South cooperation into the \r\nOrganization’s programmes and activities. \r\n Terrorism continues to pose a great threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. Colombia rejects \r\nterrorism in all its forms and supports regional and \r\ninternational initiatives to combat that scourge. We are \r\nall committed to the fight against terrorism. My \r\ndelegation wishes to highlight the progress made since \r\nthe adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and urges all Member States to fully \r\nimplement that instrument and to strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination aimed at \r\neliminating that threat. \r\n The democratic security policy of the \r\nGovernment of President Uribe has enabled us to \r\nrestore law and order and the institutions of the rule of \r\nlaw in all regions of the country. Since 2002, the \r\nhomicide rate has fallen more than 40 per cent. \r\nLikewise, during the current Government the number \r\nof kidnappings in the country fell from 1,709 five years \r\nago to 282 last year. Terrorist attacks against the \r\ninfrastructure fell between 70 and 100 per cent during \r\nthe same period. \r\n As President Uribe stated during the general \r\ndebate (see A/62/PV.8), Colombia has been able, in a \r\ntransparent manner and with respect for freedoms and \r\nhuman rights, to reduce the number of terrorists \r\nfinanced by drug trafficking from 60,000 to 11,000 \r\nover the past five years. The Colombian Government \r\noffers every guarantee that those members of terrorist \r\norganizations who wish to abandon violence and \r\nresume their civic duties can do so within a framework \r\nthat provides truth, justice and redress for the victims. \r\nWithin that framework, 46,000 members of various \r\norganizations have been demobilized. \r\n Thanks to the democratic security policy, \r\nconfidence has also returned to the country and \r\nimportant social advances have been made. That will \r\nmake it possible to achieve the MDGs in the social \r\nsector before 2015. In the past five years, the country’s \r\nunemployment rate fell from 20 per cent to about \r\n10 per cent. We hope soon to reach a single-digit \r\nunemployment rate. The number of children benefiting \r\nfrom our food programmes has grown from 3.7 million \r\nto 9 million. We hope to be able to reach 12 million \r\nchildren in the next three years. Our hope is to achieve \r\nfull access to basic education and health care before \r\n2010. We also hope to ensure that poverty, which in \r\n2002 affected almost 60 per cent of our population, \r\nwill not exceed 35 per cent by the end of the decade. \r\n The United Nations must continue to strengthen \r\nits support to countries in eradicating poverty and \r\nachieving sustained economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. To that end, there must be greater \r\ncoherence in the operational activities of the \r\nOrganization. Coordination with Governments and \r\nnational authorities is essential in that regard in order \r\nto promote efficient and effective efforts in the field by \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n We acknowledge the role that the United Nations \r\ncan play in the area of humanitarian assistance. Issues \r\nhaving to do with humanitarian assistance must be \r\naddressed through a comprehensive approach in the \r\ncontext of the principles of impartiality, neutrality and \r\nhumanity. Humanitarian assistance must contribute to \r\nthe strengthening of local capacities, the rebuilding of \r\nthe social fabric of affected populations and the \r\ndevelopment of structures that make it possible to \r\nmove from emergency to development. \r\n It was clear from the Assembly’s general debate \r\nthat Member States consider climate change to be an \r\nimportant issue. We agree with the Secretary-General \r\nthat the Organization is in a privileged position to \r\nundertake measures that contribute to the mitigation of, \r\nand adaptation to, that phenomenon. We must take \r\nadvantage of the current political will to give impetus \r\nto agreements for the post-Kyoto period on the basis of \r\na fair and equitable regime grounded in the principle of \r\nshared and differentiated responsibilities, as well as for \r\na greater commitment by industrialized countries to \r\nreduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. \r\n Colombia, a country rich in biodiversity, has an \r\nimportant role to play in efforts to address global \r\nwarming. Through its family stewards of the forest \r\nprogramme, the Government of Colombia will soon \r\nsupport nearly 80,000 families that are committed to \r\nthe restoration and protection of the rain forest and the \r\neradication of illicit crops. We expect broad support for \r\nthe programme from the international community. \r\n Moreover, we are making progress in the \r\nconstruction of mass transport systems in nine of our \r\ncities, as well as in the production of biofuels in \r\naccordance with environmental and food security \r\npolicies. We have also succeeded in increasing the \r\n A/62/PV.20\r\n \r\n7 07-53213 \r\n \r\nnumber of gas-powered vehicles from 37,000 to almost \r\n300,000. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to reiterate our support \r\nfor the Secretary-General and his decisive efforts to \r\nconfront the challenges facing the United Nations. \r\nGiven his dedication and commitment to the objectives \r\nof the Organization, we are fully confident in \r\nsupporting him on that path and making progress \r\ntowards the goals that have been set. \r\n Mr. Salgueiro (Portugal): I am speaking today on \r\nbehalf of the European Union (EU). The candidate \r\ncountries Turkey and Croatia, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process, the potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Montenegro and Serbia and \r\nUkraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia have \r\naligned themselves with this statement. \r\n First of all, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/62/1) on the work of the \r\nOrganization. I shall avail myself of this opportunity to \r\nconsider some of the report’s main topics, as well as to \r\nshare with the General Assembly the views of the \r\nEuropean Union on the main challenges ahead. For the \r\npurpose of efficiency, and in order to save time, I will \r\nshorten my oral statement today. The full text of my \r\nremarks has already been distributed in the Hall. \r\n Allow me to start by addressing the critical issue \r\nof the implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). We find ourselves, in 2007, at the \r\nmidpoint of the path to 2015 and the ultimate objective \r\nof meeting the MDGs, to date facing a mixed record in \r\ntheir implementation. As stated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Goals have become the shared framework \r\nfor development. We are pleased that this year’s report \r\nincludes the revised MDG monitoring framework, in \r\nline with the endorsement of the MDGs at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. \r\n The European Union reaffirms its strong \r\ncommitment to the MDGs and will continue to support \r\ndeveloping countries in the implementation of their \r\nnational development strategies through actions on aid \r\nvolume and effectiveness, including debt relief, on \r\ntrade and through international institutions. Actions to \r\nachieve the Goals at all levels should be undertaken in \r\nan integrated way that promotes efficiencies and \r\nreduces duplication and unnecessary competition, \r\nwhile taking into account that development, peace and \r\nsecurity and human rights are interlinked and mutually \r\nreinforcing. \r\n On that foundation of shared responsibility and \r\npartnership, the European Union has taken effective \r\nmeasures to meet its commitments as a donor. The \r\nUnion has collectively surpassed the 2006 official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) target of 0.39 per cent \r\nof gross national income (GNI) that was set in 2005, \r\nbefore the World Summit Outcome. Furthermore, the \r\nUnion has set new ambitious targets for 2010 and \r\n2015, including new levels for Africa. The Union is \r\ncurrently providing 57 per cent of global ODA, and is \r\ncommitted to reaching the target of 0.7 per cent of GNI \r\nby 2015. We will continue to make efforts to meet and \r\nexceed our timetables, and invite other countries to \r\nfollow suit. \r\n More aid, however, is not a panacea. Making sure \r\nthat aid is more effective is as important as increasing \r\nits volume. We are pleased that the Paris Declaration \r\non Aid Effectiveness has become a widely recognized \r\nbenchmark in that regard. In addition, concluding a \r\nbalanced Doha Trade Round will ensure benefits for all \r\ncountries. Developing countries themselves need to \r\nensure high levels of governance, adopt ambitious \r\ndevelopment strategies and foster enabling \r\nenvironments for pro-poor economic growth where the \r\nprivate sector can flourish. We continue to support the \r\nstrong and comprehensive commitments made in that \r\nregard by African countries, namely, through the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) and the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). \r\n HIV/AIDS remains a global scourge that must be \r\ncombated at all levels through the scaling up of \r\nprevention, care, support and treatment, in particular as \r\nregards antiretroviral therapy. In that connection as \r\nwell, the development and implementation of inclusive \r\ncountry-led strategies based on the Three Ones \r\nprinciple is key. Special attention must be paid to \r\ncombating stigma and discrimination, protecting \r\nhuman rights, including those of vulnerable groups, \r\nand sexual and reproductive health and rights, in \r\nparticular of women and young people, in accordance \r\nwith the Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development. \r\n As the Secretary-General clearly outlines in his \r\nreport, Africa remains in need of special attention as it \r\nlags behind other developing regions in achieving the \r\nMDGs. In this context, the European Union is working \r\nA/62/PV.20  \r\n \r\n07-53213 8 \r\n \r\ntogether with its African partners to develop a \r\ncomprehensive joint strategic partnership to be adopted \r\nat the EU-Africa Summit scheduled to take place in \r\nLisbon in December. \r\n Another priority for the European Union is \r\ncombating climate change. The European Union \r\ncommends the report of the Secretary-General for \r\nhighlighting — for the first time — climate change as a \r\nseparate priority theme, and one of the utmost \r\nimportance. Indeed, climate change threatens to \r\nundermine the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the MDGs. Thus, we deeply believe \r\nthat the United Nations must be at the centre of global \r\nefforts to tackle climate change. The European Union \r\nstrongly advocates constructive dialogue and \r\nencourages consideration of these issues in all \r\nappropriate forums, as long as these efforts remain \r\nlinked to the United Nations process. \r\n The high-level event on climate change convened \r\nby the Secretary-General on 24 September was a \r\nlandmark and, above all, represents a resolute effort to \r\nforge a coalition to accelerate a global response to \r\nclimate change and build international momentum for \r\nthe negotiations starting this December in Bali with a \r\nview to ending with a global and comprehensive \r\nagreement on a post-Kyoto framework in Copenhagen \r\nin 2009. \r\n The major effort to fight climate change in the \r\nimmediate future must come from the major emitters. \r\nAll developed countries need to commit to binding \r\nabsolute emission reductions. But their actions alone \r\nwill not be enough to reduce global greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. It is indispensable that developing \r\ncountries, and in particular the major emerging \r\neconomies, start to reduce their emissions growth as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\n The European Union considers it is vital to \r\nprevent global warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius \r\nabove pre-industrial levels. Although ambitious, this \r\ngoal is both technically reasonable and economically \r\naffordable, if major emitters act urgently, leading by \r\nexample. That is why the European Union is \r\ncommitted to cutting its emissions and becoming a \r\nhighly energy-efficient, low-carbon economy. \r\n Adaptation and mitigation strategies have to be \r\nfully integrated into strategies for poverty eradication \r\nin order to be able to reach the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals as well as development planning \r\nand budgeting targets, throughout the United Nations \r\nsystem and in a coherent and mutually reinforcing way. \r\n Allow me now to turn to peace and security. The \r\nEuropean Union shares the Secretary-General’s view \r\non the importance of peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nand of promoting the necessary preventive actions in \r\nresponse to threats. It expresses appreciation for the \r\nSecretary-General’s good offices in finding solutions \r\nfor several ongoing conflicts. \r\n The European Union encourages further progress \r\non issues such as security sector reform; disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration; the role of natural \r\nresources in conflict; the rule of law; electoral \r\npractices; peacebuilding; democratic governance; the \r\nprotection of civilians and the return of refugees and \r\ninternally displaced persons; and humanitarian \r\nassistance and development. It restates the \r\nunquestionable interconnection between development \r\nand security. \r\n The European Union further underlines the \r\nimportance of strengthening the cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and regional and subregional \r\norganizations, as well as among those international \r\nplayers. In this framework, the European Union \r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s initiative on \r\nbuilding strategic partnerships in order to consolidate \r\npeace and security, and is particularly pleased with the \r\nsigning on 12 June 2007 of the joint statement on \r\nUnited Nations-European Union cooperation in the \r\nfield of crisis management. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission was created to \r\naddress a gap in the United Nations system concerning \r\nthe situation of countries emerging from conflict. \r\nDuring its first year of operation, the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture contributed to developing a \r\ncomprehensive international response to the needs of \r\nthe countries under its consideration. The European \r\nUnion actively supported the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission during its first year and \r\nwill continue to do so on the basis of its long-standing \r\nexperience, resources and worldwide engagement. \r\n The European Union supports the United Nations \r\nas the only truly global forum to counter terrorism and \r\nrecognizes that the Organization has a key role in \r\nmobilizing the international community to combat this \r\nthreat. The EU believes that the adoption of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by the \r\nGeneral Assembly (resolution 60/288) was a significant \r\n A/62/PV.20\r\n \r\n9 07-53213 \r\n \r\nachievement. We must ensure its full implementation, \r\nincluding by reaching agreement on a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism as soon as \r\npossible. For that reason, the European Union is \r\nactively cooperating with the Secretary-General’s \r\nCounter-terrorism Implementation Task Force and \r\nstrongly supports its further consolidation. \r\n On the disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nagenda, the EU commends the Secretary-General for \r\nhis commitment and reiterates its support for the \r\nproposed reforms in this realm, as well as for \r\nresolution 61/257, which provided for the creation of \r\nan Office for Disarmament Affairs headed by a High \r\nRepresentative at Under-Secretary-General level. \r\n The European Union remains committed to \r\nupholding, implementing and also to further \r\nstrengthening the multilateral disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation treaties and agreements. Thus, it has \r\noften expressed its disappointment at the lack of \r\nprogress in that field. \r\n Nevertheless, some important developments have \r\ntaken place this past year, as rightly pointed out by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report. These include the \r\npositive spirit which, in the end, prevailed during the \r\nfirst session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); the \r\nconstructive, structured and substantive discussions \r\nthat took place during the first part of this year’s \r\nsession of the Conference on Disarmament; the \r\nlaunching of a process for an arms trade treaty and the \r\nconsensus reached in June 2006 on the report of the \r\nGroup of Governmental Experts on illicit brokering \r\n(A/62/163). The European Union appeals to all \r\nMember States to build on these positive, albeit \r\nmodest, developments with a view to revitalizing the \r\ninternational disarmament agenda. In particular, while \r\nregretting that the stalemate in the Conference on \r\nDisarmament was not overcome this year, the \r\nEuropean Union urges the Conference to resume its \r\nnegotiating role in early 2008. \r\n The European Union shares the Organization’s \r\ndesire for a negotiated solution to the issues raised by \r\nthe nuclear programmes of Iran and the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. To that effect, the \r\nEuropean Union underlines its continuing commitment \r\nto the comprehensive package proposed to Iran in June \r\n2006 and annexed to Security Council resolution \r\n1747 (2007). That package, among many elements, \r\nreaffirmed Iran’s right to develop nuclear energy in \r\nconformity with its obligations under the NPT and \r\nincluded active support to build new light-water power \r\nreactors using state-of-the-art technology. \r\n With the adoption of the institution-building \r\npackage by the Human Rights Council last June \r\n(Human Rights Council resolution 5/1), we have taken \r\nyet another big step towards giving our Organization \r\nthe ways and means to effectively address human \r\nrights in its work. The European Union hopes that all \r\nconditions are now in place for efficient and credible \r\nimplementation of the Council’s mandate, as foreseen \r\nin General Assembly resolution 60/251. In this regard, \r\nthe European Union would like to see an improved and \r\nstronger system of special procedures coming out of \r\nthe review of the individual mandates that was just \r\nstarted at the sixth session of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Besides the new human rights treaties mentioned \r\nin the report, the European Union would also like to \r\nsalute the adoption of the United Nations Declaration \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution \r\n61/295). \r\n The European Union welcomes the work done so \r\nfar by the Security Council working group on children \r\nand armed conflict, as well as that of the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on Children \r\nand Armed Conflict and that of UNICEF. Furthermore, \r\nthe adoption of the Paris Principles and Commitments \r\nearlier this year and the 10-year review of the Graça \r\nMachel report (A/51/306) also contribute to \r\nhighlighting this important issue. \r\n The European Union remains committed to the \r\nprinciples and fundamental rights that are set out in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and is looking \r\nforward to the commemorations of the Declaration’s \r\nsixtieth anniversary in 2008. It is our belief that we \r\nshould mark that anniversary by implementing and \r\nmainstreaming human rights in the work of the \r\nOrganization, including at the field level, and counting \r\non the valuable work of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights and her Office. \r\n The EU attaches great importance to promoting \r\nand strengthening the rule of law at national and \r\ninternational levels and supports the proposals \r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General to that effect. The \r\nnewly established Rule of Law Coordination and \r\nA/62/PV.20  \r\n \r\n07-53213 10 \r\n \r\nResource Group and its Secretariat unit need to be \r\nsupported if they are to fulfil their functions of \r\nimproving information flows, reducing duplication, \r\nidentifying gaps and improving system-wide \r\ncoordination. The European Union calls on the \r\nSecretary-General and Member States to provide all the \r\nassistance necessary to ensure that the Group and the \r\nunit can adequately fulfil their important functions. \r\n The European Union also underlines its \r\ncommitment to ending impunity for the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community and \r\ngives its entire support to the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) and its activities. The EU attaches great \r\nimportance to United Nations support for the ICC. We \r\ntherefore call for the universal ratification of the Rome \r\nStatute and stress the importance of cooperation by \r\nStates parties and States not parties with the Court, \r\nboth in general and specifically with regard to the \r\nexecution of arrest warrants. \r\n The European Union is also committed to the \r\nadvancement of the humanitarian reform agenda, \r\nincluding through the development of improved \r\ncoordination capacity and more predictable funding. To \r\nthis effect, we attach great importance to risk \r\nreduction, preparedness and response capacity at all \r\nlevels, in order to face the challenges which derive \r\nfrom natural disasters. We also attach great importance \r\nto developments such as the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund, the cluster approach and humanitarian \r\npartnerships. \r\n At the same time, the European Union is \r\nparticularly alarmed at the current humanitarian and \r\nsecurity situations in the Sudan, Iraq, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Somalia and Sri Lanka, and \r\nwill support all efforts to prevent and denounce gender-\r\nbased violence, to promote protection and assistance to \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, and to \r\nensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian \r\nworkers to the people in need. We must therefore \r\ncontinue our collective efforts to improve the \r\neffectiveness of humanitarian response.  \r\n With specific regard to the situation in Darfur, the \r\nEuropean Union welcomes progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Joint Communiqué on \r\nFacilitation of Humanitarian Activities in Darfur, \r\nwhich was signed in March 2007. \r\n On the issue of United Nations reform, we \r\nwelcome the progress made in management reform \r\nwith the establishment of the Independent Audit \r\nAdvisory Committee and the strengthening of the \r\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services. The European \r\nUnion also looks forward to the upcoming reforms on \r\nthe administration of justice, information and \r\ncommunication technology, and procurement.  \r\n If we want real reform of the Organization, we \r\nmust not forget its biggest asset — the staff — and a \r\nreform of human resources that can build a truly \r\ndiverse, mobile, multifunctional and accountable staff. \r\n The European Union is committed to ensuring the \r\navailability of adequate resources for the United \r\nNations, while adhering to our long-standing principle \r\nof budgetary discipline. We will therefore seek to adopt \r\na budget for 2008-2009 that will enable the United \r\nNations to deliver meaningful results in all its activities \r\nwithin a reasonable envelope. \r\n Furthermore, the European Union wishes to \r\ncommend the work done in the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the purpose of the revitalization \r\nof the Assembly, namely through the thematic debates \r\non issues of particular relevance to the membership, \r\nand it welcomes the consultations that took place on \r\nthis subject, which drew active participation from \r\nMember States and led to the adoption of resolution \r\n61/292, which has the potential to have a significant \r\nimpact on the way the General Assembly — and the \r\nUnited Nations as a whole — conducts its work. \r\n The European Union also welcomes the \r\nrestructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations, as set out in resolution 61/256, and looks \r\nforward to the full establishment of the Department of \r\nField Support, including the appointment of an Under-\r\nSecretary-General. \r\n The European Union welcomed the informal \r\nconsultations on system-wide coherence organized \r\nduring the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. \r\nThe European Union agrees with the Secretary-General \r\nthat “delivering as one” (A/62/1, para. 5) must become \r\na reality. Bearing in mind the EU’s traditional \r\ncommitment to advancing women’s rights, and \r\nconvinced that gender issues should be mainstreamed \r\nand that the United Nations architecture in this field \r\nshould be streamlined as a matter of urgency, the \r\nEuropean Union is adamant that a gender entity should \r\nbe established at the Under-Secretary-General level. In \r\naddition, we would like to reiterate our willingness to \r\nwork with the wider membership of the United \r\n A/62/PV.20\r\n \r\n11 07-53213 \r\n \r\nNations, and all other relevant stakeholders, to \r\nstrengthen international environmental governance and \r\nupgrade the United Nations Environment Programme \r\ninto a United Nations Environment Organization.  \r\n All in all, the EU looks forward to pursuing this \r\nprocess in an inclusive and transparent manner during \r\nthe sixty-second session of the General Assembly and \r\ncounts on Member States to come together with a view \r\nto enhancing overall coherence and effectiveness \r\nwithin the United Nations. \r\n The European Union agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations can do its job properly \r\nonly with partners. The EU thus welcomes the progress \r\nmade in developing partnerships with global \r\nconstituencies. Strengthening the relationship with \r\ncivil society and the private sector and improving links \r\nwith national parliaments will help the United Nations \r\nto achieve its goals. \r\n Finally, the European Union would like to praise \r\nthe Secretary-General and all his staff for their \r\ndedicated work and to wish Mr. Ban Ki-moon all the \r\nbest for his term in office. Allow me as well to \r\ncongratulate former President of the General Assembly, \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her tireless efforts \r\nthroughout the course of her mandate. \r\n Mr. Hagen (United States of America): When the \r\nUnited States embraced the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) in this Hall in the year 2000, it was \r\nwith great hope and determination for the future. We \r\nhoped to raise the standard of living for all people and \r\nto work together to eliminate major blights afflicting \r\nmankind, among them, poverty, disease, notably the \r\nspread of AIDS, the death of children and chronic \r\nmalnutrition. My Government, like many others, made \r\na commitment to align its national development \r\nassistance strategies with the goals and the ambitious \r\ntimeline of the Millennium Declaration.  \r\n While there is clearly much more to do, we can \r\nbe proud of the progress we have made, as noted in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/62/1). The number of \r\npeople who live on less than a dollar a day is falling. \r\nIndeed, the proportion globally fell from nearly a third \r\nto less than a fifth between 1990 and 2004. The number \r\nof people with access to safe drinking water is rising \r\nby more than 10 million annually in Africa alone. More \r\nchildren have access to education, with the global \r\nprimary enrolment rate having reached 88 per cent in \r\n2005, and access is increasingly equal for both girls \r\nand boys. Child mortality rates are falling and child \r\nhunger is declining. \r\n While much remains to be done to reverse the \r\nspread of AIDS and help AIDS orphans, great work has \r\nbegun. For our part, the United States launched the \r\nPresident’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Today, \r\n25 per cent of all assistance to combat AIDS \r\nworldwide comes from the United States.  \r\n As the Secretary-General observed in his report,  \r\n “rapid and large-scale progress towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals is possible when \r\nstrong government leadership, good policies and \r\npractical strategies for increasing public \r\ninvestments are combined with adequate financial \r\nand technical support from the international \r\ncommunity”. (A/62/1, para. 17) \r\n We are responding with assistance programmes \r\nthat address many of the internationally agreed \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Through the \r\nMillennium Challenge Corporation, for example, we \r\nare reducing poverty through growth and have signed \r\ncompacts with 14 countries worth $4.5 billion. \r\nMoreover, discussions continue with many more \r\nStates. \r\n Clearly, much progress has been made, even if a \r\ngreat deal more must be done between now and 2015. \r\nWe remain optimistic. To quote former United States \r\nSecretary of State Powell, “perpetual optimism is a \r\nforce multiplier”. In that spirit, we have embraced \r\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s recent call to \r\naction. \r\n Reviewing the Secretariat’s work in the report \r\nbefore us, the United States would emphasize the need \r\nto stay focused on global goals, not every goal for \r\nevery country. The report takes great pains to evaluate \r\nthe shape and dimensions of our work. Yet it uses \r\nperformance indicators for each and every country that \r\nMember States have not ratified. In so doing, the goals \r\nhave begun to be expanded and redefined without \r\nconsulting the Member States. While the report \r\ncatalogues progress it also purports to highlight failure, \r\nbut measured against indicators that are not our own.  \r\n Development assistance achieves the greatest \r\ngood when it supports a plan owned by the receiving \r\nState and its citizens. Although we all strive for justice, \r\nopportunity and growth, States have different \r\npriorities, needs and systems. At its best, donor \r\nA/62/PV.20  \r\n \r\n07-53213 12 \r\n \r\nassistance to recipient countries is catalytic and based \r\non self-help. \r\n In the Millennium Declaration, we asked the \r\nSecretary-General to issue periodic reports for \r\nconsideration by the General Assembly and as a basis \r\nfor further action. We did not ask that numerical targets \r\nbe created and then expanded, or that new indicators be \r\nselected to judge us. There is no doubt that, despite \r\nbest efforts to meet our commitments, we have yet to \r\nfulfil our aspirations. But creating new definitions or \r\nexpanding the scope of previously agreed Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals will not help us maintain \r\nconsensus. Let us stay focused on what we set out to \r\naccomplish and renew our commitment to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals affirmed here on \r\n8 September 2000. \r\n In context, the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand associated development strategies become real and \r\nsustainable only when associated with continuing \r\neconomic growth and increased country ownership and \r\ncapacity. Let us achieve those goals, and make them \r\nour hallmark in this young millennium. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): The annual report \r\n(A/62/1) of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the \r\nwork of the Organization is an excellent overview of \r\nthe achievements made during the past year, as well as \r\nof the complex challenges facing us. The report helps \r\nus to keep focus on the main issues — on the need for \r\ngood governance and accountability, both within the \r\nOrganization as well as in Member States. \r\n We thank the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor his initiative to make climate change a central \r\ntheme for the general debate during this session of the \r\nAssembly. We also thank the Secretary-General for \r\norganizing the high-level event of 24 September, which \r\nplayed an important role in consolidating the global \r\nconsensus on the need to act. The Kyoto Protocol \r\nprovides a basis for the continuation of effective action \r\nin reducing emissions. Participants in the meeting to be \r\nheld at Bali in December should decide to start a \r\nprocess leading to a comprehensive post-2012 climate \r\nagreement.  \r\n Global warming is already devastating the lives \r\nof millions. How we address that issue will be a test of \r\nour commitment to the values of the United Nations. \r\nThe poorest in developing countries — those who are \r\nleast responsible for causing climate change — tend to \r\nbe the hardest hit. We have to focus on their needs in \r\nour common effort to fight this global threat. \r\nAdaptation to climate change should therefore be dealt \r\nwith as an integral part of our efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n The Foreign Minister of Iceland emphasized \r\ndevelopment issues in her statement at the general \r\ndebate on 28 September (see A/62/PV.11). She \r\nreiterated Iceland’s strong commitment to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and highlighted the \r\nimportance of women’s empowerment.  \r\n Official development assistance (ODA) plays a \r\nvital role in achieving the MDGs. Our ODA has \r\ndoubled over the past four years, and we aim to be \r\namong the top contributors soon.  \r\n Increased aid effectiveness is also central to \r\ndevelopment results. We support follow-up to the \r\nreport (A/61/583) of the High-level Panel on United \r\nNations System-wide Coherence, which will make the \r\nUnited Nations more effective in delivering results on \r\nthe ground.  \r\n We also support the Panel’s recommendations \r\nconcerning gender. Gender mainstreaming has to be \r\naddressed in a more systematic manner. We support the \r\nestablishment of a new gender entity and a new post of \r\nUnder-Secretary-General to strengthen the performance \r\nof the United Nations in this area of work. The \r\nexcellent work of the United Nations Development \r\nFund for Women must be built upon within the new \r\nstructures. \r\n On the issue of HIV/AIDS, Iceland fully shares \r\nthe views the Secretary-General sets out in his report. \r\nWe believe that the fight against AIDS should remain a \r\npriority and that the United Nations should become a \r\nmodel workplace with regard to the issue. The need for \r\na sustainable response over the long term has indeed \r\nbecome clearer than ever. \r\n The United Nations is the premier international \r\norganization responsible for maintaining peace and \r\nsecurity. That is a complex, multidimensional task. We \r\nstrongly support intensifying the work of the United \r\nNations in the area of conflict prevention. That is \r\nindeed in line with the holistic approach we have \r\nincreasingly applied to our work. As has so often been \r\nsaid in the Hall, there can be no security without \r\ndevelopment and no development without security. \r\n With over 100,000 persons in the field, United \r\nNations peacekeeping activities have expanded rapidly. \r\n A/62/PV.20\r\n \r\n13 07-53213 \r\n \r\nThe new peacebuilding architecture is beginning to \r\nprove its value for peacebuilding operations. Iceland \r\nwill continue to contribute to the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n Millions experience assaults on their personal \r\nsecurity, including through terrorism. We welcome the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\n(resolution 60/288), which will be an important plan of \r\naction in our fight against terrorism. It is now up to us, \r\nthe Member States, to implement it. That successful \r\npartnership should be a motivation for us to finalize a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\nduring this session of the General Assembly. \r\n As a small island State without a military of its \r\nown, Iceland is concerned by the current situation in \r\nthe field of disarmament, where, despite continued \r\nefforts by the majority of Member States over a \r\nnumber of years, very little progress has been \r\nachieved, some of it outside the United Nations \r\nframework. Our failures in that area pose a threat to \r\npeace and security. Now is the time to renew our \r\nefforts. The international community must react \r\ncollectively and firmly, within the United Nations \r\nframework, to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. The conclusion of an arms trade treaty would \r\ncertainly be a significant achievement. \r\n The protection and promotion of fundamental \r\nhuman rights is one of the primary aims of the United \r\nNations. The Secretary-General notes in his report the \r\nsignificant progress that the international community \r\nhas made in advancing human rights standards and \r\nmechanisms. Iceland welcomes that development. The \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council was an \r\nimportant event. Work should continue on its \r\nconsolidation. \r\n Most of our work within this institution is \r\ninterlinked, and it is evident that poverty, inequality \r\nand a lack of economic and social rights make the \r\nexercise of political and civil rights difficult. We are \r\nnow approximately halfway to our deadline for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and we will soon \r\nneed to deliver on our promises. It is incumbent upon \r\nthose who have the good fortune to be prosperous to \r\njoin in solidarity with others to make those rights \r\navailable to all. The security challenges that we face \r\nthis century are such that they can only be addressed in \r\nsolidarity with others, within this Organization. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): In his report (A/62/1), the Secretary-General \r\nrightly advances the idea that today no one can deal \r\nwith the multitude of global problems alone. Those \r\nproblems can be effectively resolved only through \r\ncollective efforts, primarily through the most \r\nrepresentative international and inter-State mechanism \r\nwith real universal competence: the United Nations. \r\nThe Organization is more essential than ever, because \r\nof the expanded place occupied by conflict in world \r\naffairs. This is related to worsening regional crises, \r\nterrorist threats and the risk of proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction, stagnation in the disarmament area \r\nand the persistence of poverty and backwardness. \r\n As a permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nthe Russian Federation intends to continue contributing \r\nactively to the implementation of a conflict-resolution \r\nstrategy that gives priority to political and diplomatic \r\nmethods. We support the view of the Secretary-General \r\non the need to revitalize the disarmament agenda on \r\nthe basis of coordinated collective efforts in which the \r\nUnited Nations must play a more effective role. We \r\nalso support his view on the need to resolve problems \r\nin that area through exclusively peaceful means on the \r\nbasis of the linkage of the processes of disarmament \r\nand the non-proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and their delivery systems. Among United \r\nNations priorities, he has singled out the effort to \r\nprevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into \r\nthe hands of non-State entities. We support the priority \r\ntask identified by the Secretary-General of increasing \r\nthe Organization’s capacity to prevent conflict through \r\nmultilateral diplomacy. The attainment of those goals \r\nwill be helped by strengthening the United Nations \r\nsystem as a whole by adapting it to global realities on \r\nthe basis of the broadest possible agreement among \r\nMember States and based on the universal inter-State \r\nnature of the United Nations.  \r\n The Russian delegation welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s intention to defend the principle of the rule \r\nof law in international affairs. We note his appeal for \r\nprogress in the achievement of historic agreements \r\nunder the newly developed concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. That concept exists only in \r\nskeleton form and does not yet have a universal \r\npolitical or legal basis. The 2005 World Summit \r\nmandated the General Assembly to continue to \r\nconsider the question, taking into account the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of United Nations and \r\ninternational law. In developing a detailed and \r\nsubstantial concept, we should base our efforts on the \r\nA/62/PV.20  \r\n \r\n07-53213 14 \r\n \r\nfact that there is no alternative to ensuring a well \r\nthought out and non-confrontational approach that \r\ntakes into account the interests of the entire \r\ninternational community and is based on the \r\nfundamental principles and norms of international law.  \r\n Efforts to guarantee safe living conditions for \r\npeople everywhere in the world must be supplemented \r\nby an effective safety mechanism against illegal \r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States. The \r\nimplementation of the concept of the responsibility to \r\nprotect on behalf of — and in the interests of — the \r\ninternational community should be carried out on the \r\nbasis of decisions taken in accordance with the Charter \r\nof United Nations. Only then will it be an effective \r\ninstrument for ensuring the rule of law in crisis \r\nsituations, when vitally important rights, values and \r\ninterests protected by international law are threatened.  \r\n The report of the Secretary-General rightly \r\nhighlights the adoption of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) and \r\nefforts to create adequate and appropriate mechanisms \r\nfor its implementation and for an integrated effort to \r\ncounter and eradicate the threat of terrorism. We \r\nsupport the further practical development of the \r\nreport’s priorities for the Secretariat’s \r\nCounter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force. We \r\nnote that the report’s review of United Nations \r\ncounter-terrorism activities does not include the \r\nSecurity Council; this, of course, is an omission.  \r\n We agree that there is a need for broader \r\ninvolvement by the business and private sector and by \r\ncivil society in the implementation of the Strategy. We \r\nnote in particular the growing support for the Russian \r\nFederation’s initiative within the Group of Eight to \r\nstrengthen counter-terrorism partnerships between \r\nStates and business.  \r\n Increasing the Organization’s capacity in the \r\nareas of human rights protection, the rule of law and \r\ndemocracy should be primarily focused on more \r\neffective cooperation and on providing assistance to \r\nStates. That kind of constructive approach, based on \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations, will \r\nmake it possible to strengthen effective interaction with \r\ninterested countries.  \r\n The report gives a prominent place to the Human \r\nRights Council, in which our hopes are placed for \r\nrestoring trust in intergovernmental processes for the \r\nprotection of rights. However, it is silent on the role of \r\nthe General Assembly, of which the Council is a \r\nsubsidiary body, and of its Third Committee.  \r\n We agree that there is a need to improve the \r\nregional representation of civil society organizations in \r\nUnited Nations forums. Above all, we should involve \r\nmore actively non-governmental structures from the \r\ncountries of the South. On the whole, we note with \r\nsatisfaction the report’s proper analysis of the \r\neconomic activities of the United Nations, which are in \r\nline with the goals set by the relevant \r\nintergovernmental decisions. However, we note that the \r\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on System-\r\nwide Coherence have not yet been the subject of \r\nintergovernmental discussion and therefore cannot be \r\nconsidered as direct guidance for action by the \r\nOrganization. \r\n In the humanitarian area, I should like to call for \r\na cautious approach to the sensitive question of the \r\nsafety of humanitarian personnel and their access to \r\npeople in need, so as not to politicize the work of the \r\nUnited Nations in this area. \r\n We also note that effectively countering climate \r\nchange involves agreed-upon and scientifically \r\njustified decisions which are realistic and fair, do not \r\ninfringe on the rights of countries to development and \r\nare genuinely universal in nature.  \r\n We attach great importance to the implementation \r\nof General Assembly decisions on Secretariat reform, \r\nincluding those on improving the effectiveness and \r\ntransparency of the functioning of the Organization in \r\nthe administrative, financial and personnel areas. We \r\nshare the view of the Secretary-General about the need \r\nfor reform in those areas. \r\n It is important to access the real output of \r\nSecretariat activities and to ensure a higher level of \r\nprofessionalism, efficiency and competence of \r\npersonnel, with clear accountability and responsibility \r\non the part of managers at all levels towards Member \r\nStates. In this respect, reform should not lead to \r\nunjustified increases in budget resources, to an \r\ninflationary staffing table or to an unjustified increase \r\nin the compensation package for United Nations staff. \r\nWe expect that the Secretary-General’s reform \r\nproposals to be in strict accordance with established \r\nprocedures and to be submitted in timely fashion to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for consideration. \r\n The meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n"
