(Cyprus) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Mavroyiannis \r\n(Cyprus), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 109 (continued) \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/62/1) \r\n Mrs. Asmady (Indonesia): Let me begin by \r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his first report on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/62/1). We very much \r\nvalue his overview of what was accomplished over the \r\npast year and his highlighting of the various factors \r\nthat need to be addressed in the future. This is an \r\nextremely important report for my delegation, as \r\nIndonesia has always stood for a robust United Nations \r\nthat plays a central role in international affairs. \r\n The report comes at a critical juncture in the \r\nhistory of the United Nations, not least because of the \r\nchange at its helm. It would not be wrong to say that \r\nthe world is going through a period of turbulence and \r\nuncertainty. Climate change, geopolitical upheaval, \r\nuneven progress in the economic and social fields and \r\nlarge pockets of persistent poverty globally are some of \r\nthe crucial challenges confronting peoples of the \r\nworld. We will tackle these issues effectively only if \r\nthe international community reaffirms its commitment \r\nto the multilateral approach and if it does so from the \r\nmost credible world platform available to the \r\ncommunity, the United Nations.  \r\n But merely highlighting the stature of the \r\nOrganization is not sufficient. All Member countries \r\nmust show through their actions that they recognize the \r\nprimacy of the United Nations in solving global \r\nchallenges, and fully support its organizational \r\nrequirements and its aims. \r\n While we instinctively associate the United \r\nNations with world peace and security, we would do \r\njust as well to associate it with development. \r\nDevelopment is, to a large extent, a prerequisite for \r\npeace and security. That is why we must not \r\nsubordinate the development role of the United Nations \r\nto any other it has to play on the world stage. That \r\nmeans that the development agenda of the \r\nUnited Nations, and in particular the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), must be \r\naccorded priority and carefully attended to in order to \r\nwin and keep the peace.  \r\n This being 2007, we are at the halfway point of \r\nthe period set for the achievement of the MDGs. Yet \r\nthe results have been less than spectacular overall. \r\nThose who most desperately need to achieve the MDGs \r\nfind themselves still unable to do so. In contrast to the \r\nbright spots of Asia, the situation remains dire in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. There, several countries are not on \r\ntrack to achieving a single MDG. In many developing \r\ncountries, particularly in their rural regions, people \r\nweather the vicissitudes of poverty every day. Their \r\nplight is being worsened by the impact of climate \r\nchange. The Secretary-General does not mince words \r\non this matter: “The Millennium Development Goals \r\nand the other internationally agreed development goals \r\nA/62/PV.22  \r\n \r\n07-53414 2 \r\n \r\ncannot be achieved… if we do not tackle climate \r\nchange” (A/62/1, para. 11). \r\n In response to that, Indonesian President Susilo \r\nBambang Yudhoyono recently echoed that sentiment \r\nwhile addressing the General Assembly. On global \r\nwarming, he said that “we are much more \r\ninterdependent than we thought in terms of the causes, \r\nsymptoms and solutions” and that there was “the need \r\nfor urgency, which means the need for action and the \r\nneed to think outside the box” (A/62/PV.5, p. 23). \r\n As a high-risk nation and the venue for the \r\nthirteenth Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and the sixth session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the Kyoto Protocol, Indonesia attaches great \r\nimportance to this issue. We expect that the Bali \r\nConference, which will be held in December, will set \r\nthe stage for the establishment of a global partnership \r\nto address climate change. Out of it should emerge \r\nconcrete actions and rationalized targets to reduce \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions after the Kyoto Protocol \r\nexpires, in 2012. \r\n Even as developing countries build the capacity \r\nto deal with climate change, they must not ignore other \r\naspects of capacity-building that are crucial for their \r\ndevelopment. Enlightened self-interest must cause \r\nthem to practice good governance and respect for the \r\nrule of law and human rights. In all of that, national \r\nefforts must be reinforced by international support, \r\nespecially from the donor community. Global \r\npartnerships are also required. \r\n The success of global partnerships will hinge on \r\nthe necessary political will. In concrete terms, they \r\nmust lead to the fulfilment of international \r\ncommitments. Instead of decreasing, as it did last year, \r\nofficial development assistance should increase. So too \r\nshould foreign direct investment, which has so far \r\nshown itself partial to only a few select emerging \r\neconomies.  \r\n The time has now come for the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round to live up to the expectations of \r\nthe developing world. Distorting subsidies, limited \r\nmarket access and the need for special and \r\ndifferentiated treatment must be tackled urgently.  \r\n In order to be able to make effective interventions \r\nto resolve those matters, the United Nations must be \r\nstrengthened through comprehensive reform. It must \r\nbecome the fulcrum to realize a just and equitable \r\nworld order. While we note meaningful progress on \r\nsome fronts, the capacity of the United Nations must \r\nbe further enhanced to address the global challenges of \r\nthe twenty-first century that lie before it. The reform \r\nprocess must impact all organs of the Organization in \r\norder to maintain the proper balance among them in \r\naccordance with the vision of the Charter. \r\n My delegation has long believed that the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as the highest deliberative and \r\ndecision-making organ of the United Nations, should \r\nembody the fullness of its capability. The General \r\nAssembly must exercise the full authority granted to it \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nSecurity Council must be adapted to reflect current \r\ngeopolitical realities. \r\n In that context, no opportunity should be lost to \r\nmove forward the global agenda on the issues of \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. As highlighted in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General, “The quest for a \r\nmore peaceful and secure world is one of the main \r\npillars of the work of the Organization” (para. 42).  \r\n The absence of consensus for action on those two \r\nchallenges should be a cause for deep concern by all. \r\nAn important first step should be to free the \r\nConference on Disarmament from its paralysis. \r\nLikewise, the restructuring of the Secretariat in the \r\ndisarmament field is very important. We are confident \r\nthat under the direct supervision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Office for Disarmament Affairs could be \r\nmade more effective in achieving its mandate. \r\n Until there is the total elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons, Indonesia remains firmly convinced that  \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States should be assured that such \r\nweapons will not be used in any situation of conflict. \r\nWhile the Secretary-General has reflected on the three \r\nissues to be negotiated within the framework of the \r\nConference on Disarmament, the issue of negative \r\nsecurity assurances has not attracted much attention. \r\nThat matter should not be overlooked. \r\n In fighting terrorism, our view is that that \r\ninternational scourge is best tackled from the roots up. \r\nMore will be needed than the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy, which was adopted last \r\nyear as resolution 60/288, to decisively overcome that \r\nproblem. We must redouble our efforts to settle \r\noutstanding issues linked to the draft comprehensive \r\n A/62/PV.22\r\n \r\n3 07-53414 \r\n \r\nconvention on international terrorism, which is long \r\noverdue. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report also shines the \r\nspotlight on various conflicts in the world that deserve \r\ninternational attention. We welcome the greater use of \r\nthe Office of the Secretary-General in the resolution of \r\nsuch disputes. We expect that the standing team of \r\nmediation specialists will effectively supplement the \r\nwork of the Secretary-General in that area. We hope \r\nthat, with the involvement of all the parties concerned, \r\nfurther action will be taken to find concrete solutions \r\nto festering global conflicts, particularly those in the \r\nMiddle East and Africa. Certainly, the engagement and \r\nthe costs required to defuse potential hostilities before \r\nwar actually erupts will be much less than after was \r\noccurs. \r\n In the face of protracted conflicts, we find there \r\nis an ever-increasing demand for United Nations \r\npeacekeepers. That surge in peacekeeping demands is \r\nunprecedented, with the trend likely to continue for \r\nsome time. In terms of United Nations peacekeeping, \r\nIndonesia has a proud tradition of participation going \r\nback to 1957. We will in fact be contributing a police \r\nunit for the Hybrid Operation in Darfur. Last year, in \r\nresponse to the conflict in south Lebanon, we were one \r\nof the first countries that offered to reinforce the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. The capacity \r\nof the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the \r\nfield and at Headquarters needs to be enhanced, with \r\nthe strongest possible support for peacekeeping \r\nmissions. \r\n In handling that mandate, we are convinced that \r\nthe agreed basic principles of peacekeeping — consent \r\nof the parties, impartiality and non-use of force except \r\nin self-defence and in the defence of the authorized \r\nmandate — are essential to both the safety and the \r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations. \r\n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nwe are particularly pleased that the Commission \r\nquickly came of age during the first year of its \r\noperation by considering two country cases. The task \r\nbefore us is to translate the Commission’s commitment \r\ninto tangible measures on the ground. \r\n In the sphere of the promotion of basic human \r\nrights, we are pleased to learn of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s establishment of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview Mechanism. This is an innovative mechanism \r\nwhich my delegation believes will contribute to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights on a basis of \r\nequality. It will serve to minimize the politicization of \r\nhuman rights and the use of double standards in \r\nevaluations, as we experience now. We look forward to \r\nthe early operationalization of the mechanism as it \r\nbegins its work next year. This will be a significant \r\nmilestone for the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. \r\n However, we should be duly cautious when \r\ndealing with the report’s support for the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, on which we decided during \r\nthe 2005 Summit. We continue to believe that, in \r\npractice, this will contravene the principle of the \r\nequality of States in international relations. We firmly \r\nbelieve no pretext should be created for interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of sovereign States. \r\n In conclusion, Indonesia reiterates its full support \r\nfor and willingness to cooperate with all those who \r\nendeavour to promote multilateralism. We view \r\nmultilateralism as our shield against injustice and \r\ndisrespect in international relations and as our most \r\nvaluable tool to build a better world. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): Let me \r\nexpress my delegation’s great appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for the exhaustive report on the \r\nwork of the Organization during the first year of his \r\nmandate (A/62/1). Whoever reads the report will attest \r\nthat the Secretary-General understands well the \r\npeoples’ expectations of the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization’s major responsibility in multilateral \r\ncooperation for finding appropriate solutions to the \r\nmany global challenges that humanity confronts. \r\n The Secretary-General is fully aware of the need \r\nto produce results commensurate with the problems \r\nthat need to be resolved. He has also developed an \r\nacute sense of the urgency of the action required. My \r\ndelegation would like to reiterate here our trust in him \r\nand in his entire team, and our firm support.  \r\n An old African saying tells us that we should use \r\nthe end of the old rope to weave the new. The \r\nSecretary-General can be proud of having been able to \r\nbuild on what has been achieved in the reforms \r\nlaunched in 2005 by the Member States convened here \r\nat the highest level by his predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan, \r\nto whom my delegation would like to pay a resounding \r\ntribute. \r\nA/62/PV.22  \r\n \r\n07-53414 4 \r\n \r\n The report of the Secretary-General clearly \r\nidentifies the most promising areas for measurable \r\nresults and focuses our attention on the attainment of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nparticularly in Africa, where the forecasts are the most \r\nalarming vis-à-vis the established timelines.  \r\n We share his determination to move forward. \r\nHowever long the road to attaining the goals in Africa \r\nmay seem, we can get there if we resolutely reject \r\ndefeatism and identify the short cuts which can get us \r\nto our goals. It is fortunate that the United Nations has \r\nclearly defined its own role, in particular, in the \r\ndissemination of methods and procedures that have \r\nproven themselves elsewhere in similar situations, and \r\nin mobilizing the resources needed for their large-scale \r\napplication in making strides against extreme poverty. \r\n The Millennium Villages have proven their \r\nworth, but they should not be something only for the \r\nhappy chosen few. The Secretary-General has put his \r\nfinger on the heart of the problem in this regard: the \r\nneed to mobilize the necessary resources to extend \r\nthem to the two score countries in Africa which are \r\nready to be a part of the initiative. \r\n Like the Secretary-General, my delegation \r\nurgently appeals to the international community to \r\nmake an increased effort of solidarity. We need to wake \r\nup dormant local capacities so that the underprivileged \r\ncan become agents in the sustainable improvement of \r\ntheir living conditions. \r\n In the same spirit, we thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for having underscored here the expected \r\nbenefits of improved integration of African countries in \r\ninternational trade through the suppression of the \r\nagricultural subsidies which prevent them from \r\nexploiting their comparative advantages on the \r\ninternational market and thus from attaining prosperity. \r\nBut they have to be freed from fratricidal conflicts, \r\nwhich can be prevented through better governance of \r\nour societies, fairer distribution of national income and  \r\ngreater respect for different identities and minorities.  \r\n We need also to take account of an inescapable \r\nreality, climate change, which poses such a major \r\nchallenge for Africa. Unless it is included in our \r\nplanning for Africa, climate change can undermine the \r\naccomplishments we have already achieved in our \r\nwork towards the MDGs. All aspects of the issue need \r\nto be looked at. Forecasting and prevention have to be \r\nthe key words here: forecasting, to help African \r\ncountries amass the vital stocks they need to mitigate \r\nthe impact of natural disasters; and prevention, at least \r\nto limit their effects by building the necessary \r\ninfrastructure. \r\n In this regard, the Benin Government is planning \r\nto construct an embankment along the coast to protect \r\nit from ongoing coastal erosion, which is swallowing \r\nup territory day after day. This obviously means a high \r\nlevel of investment which is beyond the capacity of \r\nresource mobilization at the national level. \r\nNonetheless, such resources are indispensable. \r\n Turning to issues of peace and security, the \r\nefforts under way on the African continent, with the \r\nhelp of the United Nations, are certainly laudable, \r\nbecause strengthening the mechanisms established in \r\nAfrica is of vital importance. I would like to echo the \r\nappeal to the Security Council issued several days ago \r\nby the Chairperson of the African Union Commission \r\nin favour of a creative re-reading of Chapter VIII of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. We look forward to the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on this question. \r\n In the view of my delegation, the situation is \r\nsimple: Africa would like to take its place in the \r\ncollective security system instituted by the Charter. It \r\nis asking for that, within a partnership based on a \r\nbalanced allocation of roles. We are counting on the \r\nSecretary-General to promote this partnership, in a \r\nspirit of faithfulness to the Charter and in the quest for \r\nefficiency with the pragmatism that is appropriate \r\nwhen saving human lives. We are happy to note that \r\nthese criteria have indeed prevailed in the way in \r\nwhich the issue of Darfur has been treated.  \r\n Similarly, we welcome the efforts deployed by \r\nthe Secretary-General in order to strengthen the \r\ncapacities of the United Nations in the area of \r\nmediation, preventive diplomacy and restoring peace.  \r\n In the course of these recent years, it has become \r\nobvious that the United Nations must review its policy \r\nin the area of response to complex crises. The necessity \r\nof rapid troop deployment means that forces have to be \r\navailable and that they have to be well trained and well \r\nequipped if they are to participate effectively in \r\nstabilization operations.  \r\n It is fortunate that developed countries are \r\nbecoming increasingly involved at the operational \r\nlevel, as in the deployment of the European Union in \r\nChad and the Central African Republic. This helps to \r\n A/62/PV.22\r\n \r\n5 07-53414 \r\n \r\nmake up for weaknesses in the capacities of developing \r\ncountries’ armies, which, until recently, shouldered \r\nmost of the responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity in Africa.  \r\n When it comes to peacebuilding, we think that all \r\ncountries that emerge from a conflict should be eligible \r\nfor the interventions of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nwhich should come up with a true Marshall Plan for \r\nsuch countries. The strategic frameworks of such \r\ninterventions should aim at sustainable financing, \r\namong other things, by creating matching funds that \r\nmultiply tenfold the impact of the contributions already \r\nmobilized. It must be emphasized that these \r\ncontributions remain relatively modest. \r\n The adoption by consensus of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy was a true turning \r\npoint in mobilizing Member States against the scourge \r\nof terrorism, which is to be condemned in all its \r\nmanifestations. In this regard, my country participated \r\nactively in the Vienna symposium in May 2007 in \r\norder to promote the implementation of this global \r\nstrategy through an integrated approach.  \r\n We are convinced that this approach will provide \r\nus with results only if it strengthens the capacity of \r\nStates to fulfil their sovereign functions from the \r\nviewpoint of protecting human lives and goods and \r\nexercising effective control over the territory under \r\ntheir jurisdiction, as well as promoting the necessary \r\nstability to ensure balanced economic and social \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n With respect to disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, the Secretary-General has showed \r\nwhat his preferences are, and we have followed suit, \r\ncounting on him to bring those States that are key \r\nactors in this area to show consistency in their efforts \r\nto strengthen international peace and security. No \r\neffort should be spared to make sure that the logic of \r\npeace prevails in their relations. We pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General for the positive signals that seem to \r\nbe appearing in this area.  \r\n All of humankind stands to benefit both from \r\nspecific initiatives to reduce the level of military \r\nspending and from the implementation of the United \r\nNations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and \r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light \r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects, whose potential to cause \r\nharm is well known to us.  \r\n The Secretary-General rightly underscores the \r\naffirmation of the responsibility to protect as a new \r\ninternational standard compatible with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, which the international community \r\nshould stand ready to exercise in the service of human \r\ndignity, just as it has deployed efforts to establish the \r\nauthority of institutions of international criminal \r\njustice. We are calling for  more frequent recourse to \r\ninternational justice and, in particular, to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. The international \r\ncommunity must take full advantage of the deterrent \r\ncapacity of the Court in respect of crimes within the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction.  \r\n It would be desirable that it also contribute, as a \r\nsecondary effect, to the enhancement of the respect for \r\nhuman rights as a set of universal values that maintain \r\ntheir applicability everywhere. In this regard, cultural \r\ndiversity, which is a positive good, being a framework \r\nfor the expression of identities that represent the \r\nrichness of humanity, should not be used as a pretext to \r\nperpetuate practices that belong in the past and are \r\ndeeply offensive to our collective conscience.  \r\n My delegation firmly supports the principle of \r\nunity of action in emergency situations. This principle \r\nwill be of value only if there is integrated coordination \r\nthat takes advantage of synergies in the field in order to \r\nbe more effective in protecting victims and afflicted \r\npersons.  \r\n We are confident that the clear-sightedness of the \r\nSecretary-General will guide Member States in the \r\nimplementation of their reforms for greater coherence. \r\nWe thus adhere to the recommendations of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on System-wide Coherence in order to \r\nstrengthen the Organization’s ability to act in the \r\nservice of its mission. We have to redouble our efforts \r\nto make sure that the institutional reform moves \r\nforward, especially the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in both categories of members. In accordance \r\nwith the Ezulwini Consensus, my delegation is asking \r\nfor two permanent seats for Africa and two \r\nnon-permanent seats, to enable the architecture of \r\npeace and security on the continent to be integrated \r\nharmoniously in the collective security architecture set \r\nup by the Charter.  \r\n In conclusion, my delegation thinks that a \r\nrevitalized General Assembly is an enterprising \r\nGeneral Assembly that fully shoulders its \r\nresponsibilities and prerogatives vis-à-vis other bodies \r\nA/62/PV.22  \r\n \r\n07-53414 6 \r\n \r\nand is supported by Secretariat that  performs at the \r\nvery top of its abilities. \r\n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): The General Assembly is concluding this \r\nmorning the review of the first annual report on the \r\nwork of the Organization that the Secretary-General, \r\nsince his election, presented to us, in accordance with \r\nArticle 98 of the Charter. \r\n My delegation believes that it is a solid and \r\ninformative report. It is excellent in two ways. First, it \r\nis a document that has the merit of emphasizing the \r\nirreplaceable role of the United Nations for humanity, \r\nas it seeks suitable responses to the many problems \r\nwith which it is confronted, in particular, with regard to \r\npeace and security, development and human rights, and \r\nclimate change. The response to all these challenges \r\ncannot be undertaken unilaterally or by a group of \r\nStates. The report is also excellent because it points to \r\nthe ways and means to meet these challenges. For us, it \r\nwill serve as a compass. I would like to mention, in \r\nparticular, some of these challenges by which the value \r\nof our commitments and the degree of our political \r\nwill, so often affirmed and reaffirmed, will be judged.  \r\n First, there is the thorny question of attaining the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The fact, \r\nunfortunately, is that most developing countries may \r\nnot attain them by 2015 because poverty continues to \r\nincrease, particularly in rural areas. Investments for \r\nhealth and education are in significant decline. We are \r\nstill awaiting the great increase in official development \r\nassistance (ODA) which was meant to support the \r\nefforts of developing countries.  \r\n The situation of Africa is of particular concern. \r\nOne must wonder what happened to the solemn \r\ncommitments undertaken by heads of State, both at the \r\nMillennium Summit and at the 2005 World Summit, to \r\nrespond to Africa’s special needs. Seven years away \r\nfrom 2015, we must once again urgently appeal to the \r\ninternational community, in particular to the donor \r\ncountries, to keep the commitments they have made in \r\nvarious international forums regarding official \r\ndevelopment assistance. \r\n In this respect, we have been assured that the \r\nSecretary-General will not delay in strengthening the \r\nOffice of his Special Adviser on Africa. That Office \r\nprovides impetus for present and future action to \r\nrespond to the special needs of Africa and consolidates \r\nall the various initiatives for that purpose. We will \r\nreturn to that question later, but I think we should \r\nemphasize the importance of this Office. This post of \r\nAdviser is in line with the dynamic of creating \r\nadministrative Secretariat structures and their budget \r\nlines in order to support, as required, specific \r\nprogrammes of activities set out in the medium-term \r\nplan or the programme plan.  \r\n In that respect we would like to recall again that \r\nat the September 2005 World Summit heads of State or \r\nGovernment, in follow-up to the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, adopted a series of special measures \r\nlinked to the specific needs of Africa, which continues \r\nto be one of the Organization’s main priorities. We \r\nbelieve that we should continue to address this priority \r\nseparately at a very high level in accordance with the \r\nwill and political decisions of heads of State at the \r\nMillennium Summit and at the 2005 World Summit.  \r\n As an operational structure, the Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Africa is \r\nresponsible for mobilizing public opinion in the world \r\nso that the continent will remain at the top of the \r\ninternational agenda. Furthermore, the Office is, in a \r\nway, a coordinator and overall monitor. It assembles in \r\nan annual report the contributions of United Nations \r\nbodies regarding the implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and it \r\nproposes the strategic direction of those reports. It also \r\nactively follows the synergies developed in the Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development \r\n(TICAD) process, the Forum on China-Africa \r\nCooperation, the Group of Eight (G-8) and more \r\nrecently with countries such as India, the Republic of \r\nKorea and Brazil with a view to a partnership aimed at \r\ngreater development of Africa.  \r\n In other words, the Office has multiple functions, \r\nsome of which come from the former Office of the \r\nSpecial Coordinator for Africa and the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, the previous focal point in the \r\nOffice of the Director-General for Development and \r\nInternational Economic Cooperation in the 1980s. \r\nOthers still are new and constantly evolving without \r\nbeing entirely in line with the dynamic of the least \r\ndeveloped countries and other categories of developing \r\ncountries, which are the object of completely different \r\nspecial global or regional programmes and processes.  \r\n With all those responsibilities, we believe that the \r\nOffice should retain all due importance, while \r\nmaintaining its integrity and gaining new vitality \r\n A/62/PV.22\r\n \r\n7 07-53414 \r\n \r\nthrough strengthened financial and human resources, \r\nan improved programme structure and, in particular, \r\nthe appointment of a new Adviser without further \r\ndelay. That is the recommendation of the Committee \r\nfor Programme and Coordination (CPC) and the \r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary \r\nQuestions (ACABQ) in their respective annual reports. \r\nIt is also an urgent request of the African Group. \r\n We were reassured to hear the Secretary-General, \r\nas he started his mandate, affirm that he attached great \r\npriority to Africa in his agenda. We were also reassured \r\nto note that that priority figured in the decisions taken \r\nduring the first 12 months of his mandate. We are \r\nconvinced that he will not delay in following up the \r\nrecommendations of CPC and ACABQ and, as I said \r\nearlier, the insistent request of the African Group. We \r\nwill return to this in due course when we consider the \r\nquestion of cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand Africa, in particular NEPAD.  \r\n The second challenge I wish to mention concerns \r\nclimate change. In that respect, we wish to commend \r\nthe President’s initiative to make climate change an \r\nessential theme of our work. We welcome the fact that \r\nthe high-level event on 24 September 2007 reflected \r\nglobal consensus on the need for urgent action to \r\npreserve planet Earth. We continue to believe that the \r\nKyoto Protocol is a relevant instrument towards a \r\ngenuine reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and we \r\nhope that the December 2007 Bali Conference will \r\ntrigger a process leading to a post-2012 climate \r\nagreement.  \r\n The urgency of action on climate change is \r\ngreater. Global warming has much more devastating \r\neffects in developing countries, because they are less \r\nwell equipped to deal with it. Thus, millions of lives \r\nare threatened by floods, and meagre development \r\nefforts are laid waste by the encroachment of deserts. \r\nThis is an area that demands concrete, immediate and \r\nconcerted action by the international community.  \r\n The third challenge concerns peace and security, \r\nwhich the report addresses at length. Here, we wish to \r\ncommend the Organization’s conflict prevention and \r\npeacebuilding activities. In that context, Africa intends \r\nto gradually increase its contributions to peacekeeping \r\nforces. That is why, in addition to the two institutions \r\nthat train experienced units, in Ghana and Mali, my \r\ncountry, with the support of donor States, has been \r\nurged to establish an institution to train international \r\npolice and security personnel for African States \r\nwishing to contribute to United Nations or African \r\nUnion peacekeeping forces. We will have an \r\nopportunity to learn a bit more about that at the donor \r\nconference for such a school, to be held at United \r\nNations Headquarters on 22 October 2007. Naturally, \r\nwe are counting on active participation by all Member \r\nStates. \r\n My country welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nbold reforms of structures responsible for peace and \r\nsecurity issues. Likewise, we welcome the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which will \r\nbe an important instrument in the fight against that \r\nphenomenon. It is up to all Member States to \r\ndemonstrate their goodwill so that the long-awaited \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\ncan be finalized.  \r\n Strengthening the Organization — the ultimate \r\ngoal of the reform projects under discussion — is \r\nclearly necessary, because the challenges to be met are \r\ngreat and complex. We continue to believe that \r\nstrengthening the authority of the General Assembly \r\nmust be among the essential components of United \r\nNations reform. Furthermore, the Security Council \r\nneeds to be changed in its structure and its functioning — \r\nchanges that would take into account the new \r\nconfiguration of the world. \r\n It is in this spirit that Africa has demonstrated \r\ncooperation, understanding and transparency. Indeed, \r\nwe have issued a set of proposals to the world, \r\ncontained in what has come to be called the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, which was published as a working \r\ndocument of our organization. In that document, our \r\ncontinent suggests increasing the number of seats in \r\nboth membership categories. Our continent also \r\nsuggests allocating two permanent seats for Africa, \r\nwith the right of veto. We are still waiting for a \r\npositive response from other regions. In particular, we \r\nare awaiting such a response because we believe that \r\nAfrica’s proposals and suggestions are extremely \r\nappropriate. In fact, ours is the only continent not to \r\nhave a permanent seat on the Security Council.  \r\n Not long ago, we inaugurated a new tool for \r\npromoting and protecting human rights throughout the \r\nworld. As members may have guessed, it is the Human \r\nRights Council. It is highly desirable to avoid the \r\nerrors and equivocations observed in the functioning of \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights. We are thinking in \r\nA/62/PV.22  \r\n \r\n07-53414 8 \r\n \r\nparticular of the politicization and selectivity that \r\nultimately discredited the former Commission.  \r\n Referring to human rights leads me to touch once \r\nagain upon the need to create a community that accepts \r\nits diversity and fosters tolerance. Indeed, if \r\ncivilizations have often clashed throughout history, \r\nthey have always ultimately agreed to organize a \r\ndynamic of peaceful existence in order to ensure their \r\nsurvival. Either the world will be rich in its diversity of \r\ncultures and civilizations or it will cease to exist.  \r\n In addition to its necessary reform, the \r\neffectiveness of our Organization also depends on its \r\ncooperation with regional organizations to maintain \r\npeace and security and to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Here, we welcome the innovations that \r\nthe Secretary-General has proposed to that end. In the \r\nsame spirit, Central Africa remains very intent in its \r\nrequest for a permanent presence of the Secretariat in \r\nour subregion, through the establishment of a Central \r\nAfrican office headed by an Under-Secretary-General.  \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of Cameroon wishes \r\nonce again to express its appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his excellent report, as well as its support \r\nfor his plan to reform the Organization and his \r\nintention to strengthen constructive cooperation \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Secretariat so \r\nas to ensure more effective functioning of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the Observer State of the Holy See.  \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): At the outset, \r\nmy delegation thanks the Secretary-General for his first \r\ncomprehensive report (A/62/1). We look forward to \r\nworking with him and with the membership to make \r\nthe United Nations ever more responsive to the needs \r\nof all people. \r\n As we reach the halfway point in the process of \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), the time is ripe to take stock of our successes \r\nand failures. Still today, almost 10 million children \r\nunder 5 years old die each year, mostly from \r\npreventable causes. Too many mothers die in childbirth \r\nfrom preventable and treatable complications. Last \r\nyear, 2.9 million people died of HIV/AIDS-related \r\ncauses, and half of the developing world lacks even \r\nbasic sanitation. \r\n The global community seems to have been losing \r\nfocus on the need to ensure that everyone enjoys the \r\nright to basic health care. Although studies show that \r\nsimple medical prevention is often one of the most \r\ncost-effective and successful ways of improving the \r\nhealth and stability of society, primary care is often \r\nneglected or replaced by more selective, and even \r\nculturally divisive, methods of health care. Focusing on \r\nthe whole range of basic health care will surely make a \r\nsubstantial contribution towards the achievement of the \r\nMDGs and a saner health policy. \r\n Such a sad landscape is made bleaker by the fact \r\nthat, as children die and generations lack even the basic \r\nnecessities of life, we have continued to drift towards \r\nmutual and global destruction. The annual military \r\nexpenditures of well over one trillion dollars, the talent \r\nand resources devoted to types of technology that \r\ndestroy lives and our planet and the persistence of the \r\nmisplaced trust in the law of force rather than in the \r\nforce of law are just some examples of actions that are \r\ncontrary to goodness and human reason. To prevent \r\nthat situation from worsening, the United Nations, with \r\nthe cooperation of all Member States, must renew its \r\ncommitment to the preservation of life at every level \r\nand in every corner of the world. \r\n It is nevertheless encouraging to note recent \r\nfindings indicating some real progress in achieving the \r\nMDGs. It is only right to recognize the efforts of those \r\ncountries that have contributed to the gains made. Now, \r\ngreater attention must be paid to those States that still \r\ntrail the rest of the developing world. In order to \r\nencourage both public and private investment and to \r\ncreate a favourable economic and social climate, peace \r\nand security and the rule of law should underpin \r\nreform efforts. \r\n The United Nations is increasingly being called \r\nupon to respond to multifarious challenges around the \r\nworld. To meet this ever-growing need for \r\nhumanitarian assistance, the United Nations should \r\ncontinue to work to promote partnerships with civil \r\nsociety that create a predictable and reactive \r\nhumanitarian response. Member States play an \r\nimportant role in addressing humanitarian crises. Ву \r\ngiving safe and unhindered access to humanitarian \r\nworkers, they not only fulfil their responsibility to \r\nprotect, but also help ensure that those who suffer from \r\na humanitarian tragedy are not re-victimized. \r\n A/62/PV.22\r\n \r\n9 07-53414 \r\n \r\n During the last few years, the Organization has \r\ndealt with issues related to culture and religion in an \r\nincreasing number of resolutions, meetings and side \r\nevents. That aspect is unfortunately omitted in the \r\nreport. Most often, it is only when tensions and conflict \r\nemerge that Governments and international \r\norganizations call on religious and cultural forces to \r\nhelp establish dialogue between parties. Cooperating in \r\nprogrammes against incitement to hatred, witnessing \r\nfor peace and against violence and peacemaking \r\nthrough faith-based agencies are among the many \r\nthings religious communities and their leaders can do \r\nto end conflict and to build conditions for peace. \r\n My delegation commends the United Nations \r\ncommitment to addressing the many challenges facing \r\ndevelopment, peace and security and human rights. In \r\nso doing, the Organization must maintain its \r\ntransparency and accountability to the decisions of the \r\nMember States. To that end, modifications to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, including the creation \r\nof new targets, as referred to in Annex II, need to be \r\nundertaken in an open manner rather than as a result of \r\nexecutive or administrative decisions. \r\n Finally, it is our earnest desire that the sixty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly be strongly \r\nmarked by a renewed sense of commitment and action \r\ntowards not only achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, but also to completely fulfilling \r\nthe vision of hope of this institution. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nobserver of Palestine. \r\n Mr. Hijazi (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset to express our thanks and appreciation \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations, for his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/62/1), which comes at a time when \r\ncountries of the world look to the United Nations for \r\nprogressive actions in facing challenging conditions, \r\nnoting that the United Nations is the best universal \r\ninstrument for collective efforts to face the challenges \r\nof our world. \r\n The Palestinian delegation expresses its support \r\nfor the ambitious plans to reform the Organization and \r\nto strengthen constructive cooperation between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat in the context of \r\ntransparency, confidence. We seek a more vital role for \r\nthe Organization in the field of disarmament and other \r\nspheres and note the central role played by the \r\nSecretary-General in conducting the Dialogue among \r\nCivilizations and the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \r\nCooperation for Peace, and his continued efforts to \r\nimprove the Organization. \r\n The Palestinian people also look to the United \r\nNations to help them end their tragedy and find a \r\ncomprehensive and lasting solution to their problem, \r\nwhich is as old as the Organization and which is \r\nclosely related to it. This Organization, as a peace \r\norganization, has assumed the major responsible role \r\nconcerning that question pending its comprehensive \r\nsolution. \r\n The United Nations plays a major role in dealing \r\nwith the situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, including East Jerusalem. United Nations \r\nresolutions are the legal and fundamental references for \r\nsolving the Palestinian question and for the peace \r\nprocess in the Middle East. The United Nations is also \r\na member of the Quartet, which is seeking to find a just \r\nand comprehensive international solution to the \r\nPalestinian question. \r\n The United Nations organs and agencies, notably \r\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), have a \r\nbasic and important role in supporting and assisting the \r\nPalestinian people to overcome their humanitarian \r\nplight. The United Nations has adopted many \r\nresolutions and decisions that emphasize the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the duty \r\nto protect them. \r\n There is international consensus on the dangers to \r\ninternational peace and security as a result of the \r\ncontinued absence of a just and lasting solution to the \r\nPalestinian question, especially to the stability of the \r\nMiddle East region. Continued Israeli occupation of \r\nPalestinian land, which has now lasted more than \r\n40 years, the refugee problem, which has lasted more \r\nthan 60 years, continued violation of the inalienable \r\nrights of the Palestinian people by the occupying \r\nPower and the failure of the international community \r\nto relieve the suffering of the Palestinians, are true, \r\nmoral and serious challenge to all of the principles and \r\nrules on which the Organization was founded. \r\n The issues dealt with in the report include the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, climate change, \r\nsustainable development, conflict prevention, peace \r\nand peacekeeping, human rights, the rule of law and \r\nA/62/PV.22  \r\n \r\n07-53414 10 \r\n \r\nhumanitarian affairs, all of which are unavailable in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories, including East \r\nJerusalem, because of the foreign occupation and its \r\nillegal practices. Yet, the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization does not deal \r\nwith the question in a suitable manner within the \r\ncontext of the role and responsibilities of the United \r\nNations. In that context, we wish to emphasize the \r\nfollowing.  \r\n First, the Palestinian question is the most \r\nlongstanding issue without a solution on the United \r\nNations agenda. The responsibility of the United \r\nNations towards this question is ongoing and, until \r\nsuch time that it is solved in all its aspects, the \r\ncredibility of this Organization will be jeopardized.  \r\n Secondly, the Palestinian question is of special \r\nimportance as regards human rights issues in the world, \r\nas was emphasized by the Special Rapporteur on the \r\nsituation of human rights in Palestinian territories \r\noccupied since 1967, Mr. John Dugard. The issue of \r\nhuman rights in Palestine has been on the United \r\nNations agenda for 60 years. It is a real test for the \r\nUnited Nations, a test of the Organization’s degree of \r\ncommitment to protecting human rights in Palestine. If \r\nthe United Nations and the international community \r\nfail to put an end to the violations to which the \r\nPalestinian people are subjected, the international \r\nmovement for human rights — which is considered a \r\nmajor accomplishment of humanity during the past  \r\n60 years — faces a grave danger. \r\n Thirdly, in this context, we would like to \r\nemphasize the need to strengthen the role of the \r\nOrganization in maintaining and protecting \r\ninternational law, especially the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention, relative to the protection of civilians \r\nduring times of war, which is a basic principle \r\nunderlying the responsibility to protect. \r\n Fourthly, we emphasize the importance of \r\nstrengthening the role of the Human Rights Council \r\nand respect for and implementation of its resolutions in \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 60/251, \r\nwhich established the Council, and with the Charter. \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of Palestine \r\nreiterates its thanks and gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his valuable report. We wish to assure him \r\nof our support for his efforts to promote human rights, \r\nto uphold international law, to bring justice and \r\nfreedom to all peoples of the world, especially to those \r\nwho are still under occupation. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker on the debate on this agenda item. May I take \r\nit that the Assembly takes note of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\ncontained in document A/62/1? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n109. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 114  \r\n \r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments \r\n \r\n (h) Appointment of members of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/174) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: As indicated in document \r\nA/62/174, on 11 July 2007, Inspector Juan Luis \r\nLarrabure of Peru submitted his resignation to the \r\nChairperson of the Joint Inspection Unit, effective \r\n30 September 2007. Inspector Larrabure was appointed \r\nby the General Assembly on 6 June 2003 for a five-\r\nyear term of office beginning on 1 January 2004 and \r\nexpiring on 31 December 2008. In accordance with \r\narticle 4, paragraph 5 of the statute of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit, the Chairperson notified the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on 11 July 2007 of the vacancy and of her \r\ndecision to waive the requirement of six months notice \r\nstipulated in article 4, paragraph 3 of the statute. As a \r\nresult of the resignation of Inspector Juan-Luis \r\nLarrabure of Peru, the General Assembly is required, \r\nduring the sixty-second session, to appoint a member \r\nto fill the vacancy in the Joint Inspection Unit.  \r\n It is further stated in the note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that, in order for consultations to be held as \r\nstipulated in article 3, and to align the term of office \r\nwith those of the other Inspectors, the Assembly may \r\nwish to consider filling the vacancy for the term of \r\noffice beginning on 1 January 2008 and expiring on \r\n31 December 2012.  \r\n In this connection, may I take it that it is the wish \r\nof the General Assembly to fill this vacancy for a term \r\nof office beginning on 1 January 2008 and expiring on \r\n31 December 2012? \r\n A/62/PV.22\r\n \r\n11 07-53414 \r\n \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: As also indicated in \r\ndocument A/62/174, in accordance with article 3, \r\nparagraph 1 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, \r\nthe President of the General Assembly shall consult \r\nwith Member States to draw up a list of countries — in \r\nthis case, one country — which would be requested to \r\npropose a candidate for appointment to the Joint \r\nInspection Unit. After holding the necessary \r\nconsultations, I should like to communicate to the \r\nAssembly the information received from the Chairman \r\nof the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nthat Peru has been endorsed to propose a candidate for \r\nthe vacancy from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States.  \r\n In accordance with article 3, paragraph 1 of the \r\nstatute of Joint Inspection Unit, Peru will therefore be \r\nrequested to submit the name of a candidate and the \r\ncurriculum vitae highlighting the candidate’s relevant \r\nqualifications for the task ahead. After holding the \r\nappropriate consultations described in article 3, \r\nparagraph 2 or the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, \r\nincluding consultations with the President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his capacity as Chairman of the United \r\nNations System Chief Executives Board for \r\nCoordination, I will propose a qualified candidate to \r\nthe Assembly for appointment to the Joint Inspection \r\nUnit for a period beginning on 1 January 2008 and \r\nexpiring on 31 December 2012. \r\n We have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 114. I \r\nthank delegates for their cooperation. \r\n The meeting rose at 11.20 a.m. \r\n \r\n"
