(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 10 and 110 \r\nReport of the Peacebuilding Commission (A/62/137) \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/62/138) \r\n The President: The 2005 United Nations World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) called on the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council to create \r\nnew institutional mechanisms for strengthening the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to support countries \r\nemerging from conflict. As a result, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, the Peacebuilding Support Office and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund were established. Those innovative \r\nachievements represent the most significant outcomes \r\nof the Summit to date. Therefore, it gives me great \r\npleasure to open the first joint debate to review the \r\nannual report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(A/62/137) and the report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund (A/62/138).  \r\n Over the past two decades, the United Nations \r\nhas been at the centre of expanding peacebuilding \r\nactivities in all parts of the world, including my own \r\nregion, South-Eastern Europe. The United Nations has \r\na unique comparative advantage in addressing the huge \r\nchallenges faced by countries emerging from conflict. \r\nThe demand for our peacebuilding operations and \r\ncapacities is obviously set for growth. \r\n The evidence shows that half of the countries \r\nemerging from conflict will relapse into violence \r\nwithin five years. To break that vicious circle, it is \r\ncritical that the international community provide \r\nsustained practical support and resources to assist \r\nnational efforts.  \r\n There is feedback between peace and stability, on \r\nthe one hand, and economic development, human \r\nrights and the rule of law, on the other. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has a critical role to play in \r\nbalancing both sides of that equation and in \r\naccelerating post-conflict peacebuilding and recovery. \r\nIn addition to that substantive operational role, the \r\nCommission coordinates international efforts, marshals \r\ndonor resources and focuses the attention of global \r\nopinion on peacebuilding issues. We all have a duty to \r\nensure that the Peacebuilding Commission works well \r\nand that the decision to create it is translated into \r\npractical action aimed at promoting the well-being of \r\nmillions of people trapped in post-conflict situations. \r\n I believe that the Commission has now firmly \r\nestablished itself; it has made a good start. However, \r\nthat is just the beginning of a longer process. Given the \r\norganizational complexity of the Commission, it is \r\ncrucial that its coordination with all other United \r\nNations organs and with other parts of the system be \r\nmaintained in a balanced and proportionate manner. We \r\nalso need to ensure that duplication is avoided.  \r\n The success of the Commission will clearly \r\ndepend on cooperation from all of us to support its \r\nwork — in particular, our full commitment to resolving \r\nthe few remaining procedural hurdles, so that it can be \r\nfully effective. In that context, it is important to \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 2 \r\n \r\nrecognize that it has been operational for a little more \r\nthan a year.  \r\n However, even during that short time, the \r\nCommission has brought a more coherent system-wide \r\napproach to peacebuilding and has strengthened the \r\nimpact of the international community. We should learn \r\nfrom that example and apply what we have learned to \r\nthe context of other areas in which we seek to improve \r\nthe effectiveness of United Nations activities. I am \r\nconfident that the Assembly will seize this opportunity \r\nto review and assess the work undertaken thus far by \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and to provide it with a \r\nstrategic vision of the way forward.  \r\n The two reports before us include  \r\nthought-provoking recommendations and conclusions \r\nthat the Assembly may wish to address. In particular, \r\nthe Assembly may wish to reflect on the progress \r\nachieved by the Commission and the Fund in the two \r\ncountries under their consideration, thus demonstrating \r\nour continued commitment to the peoples of both \r\ncountries. In that regard, I look forward to the remarks \r\nto be made by the delegations of Burundi and  \r\nSierra Leone. Their views and experiences related to \r\nworking with the Commission on the ground will be \r\ninvaluable.  \r\n Looking ahead, the Commission should continue \r\nto refine its strategies in the countries under \r\nconsideration, develop its advocacy role among all \r\nstakeholders engaged in peacebuilding activities and \r\nbecome more effective at marshalling resources. The \r\nCommission will also need to identify ways to improve \r\ncoherence and synergies in its numerous activities in \r\norder to contribute to better peacebuilding policy and \r\npractice. \r\n The main challenge now facing the Commission \r\nis to maximize its impact on the ground. In order to be \r\nas effective as possible, the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture must be based on the \r\nprinciple of national ownership.  \r\n It is also critical that the $250 million funding \r\ntarget of the Peacebuilding Fund be met. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank Her Excellency \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session, for her \r\nefforts to raise additional resources — with the support \r\nof the former Chairman of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, Ambassador Gaspar Martins, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Angola — and for her unique \r\npersonal contribution to the Fund. \r\n Going forward, I am sure that the membership \r\nwill lend its full support and cooperation to the new \r\nChairman of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nAmbassador Takasu, Permanent Representative of \r\nJapan, in his efforts to strengthen the Commission and \r\nto fund the remaining $20 million shortfall in the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund.  \r\n I hope that our debate today will send a strong \r\nsignal that we will reach out to meet the needs and \r\naspirations of all peoples who have suffered the horrors \r\nof war. For the people in countries emerging from \r\nconflict, this Organization represents the best and only \r\nhope of attaining a more dignified life. \r\n Therefore, the only relevant standard against \r\nwhich we can judge the success of the new \r\npeacebuilding architecture is by the practical results it \r\nachieves on the ground. \r\n I now give the floor to the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Japan, who is also the Chairman of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): First of all, on behalf of the \r\nmembers of the Peacebuilding Commission, allow me \r\nto express our heartfelt gratitude to you, Mr. President, \r\nfor providing a timely opportunity to discuss the \r\nannual report of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n In September 2005, our leaders adopted the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome, which explicitly emphasized \r\nthe need for a “coordinated, coherent and integrated \r\napproach to post-conflict peacebuilding and \r\nreconciliation with a view to achieving sustainable \r\npeace” (A/res/60/1, para. 97). The document further \r\nstates that the Commission was established “to bring \r\ntogether all relevant actors to marshal resources and to \r\nadvise on and propose integrated strategies for post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding and recovery” (ibid, para. 98). \r\n With that in mind, let me briefly look back on the \r\nfirst year of the work of the Commission. The first \r\nannual report of the Peacebuilding Commission, as \r\ncontained in document A/62/137, provides a detailed \r\naccount of the work and activities of the Commission \r\nduring the first year of its operation. The process of \r\ncompiling the report reflected the seriousness with \r\nwhich the Commission’s membership has undertaken \r\nits work and the significance it attaches to its \r\nanticipated contribution to peace consolidation and the \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n3 07-53720 \r\n \r\npromotion of national ownership of peacebuilding \r\nmeasures in post-conflict situations. Here I would like \r\nto pay special tribute to Ambassador Martins of Angola \r\nfor his dedication and leadership in steering the initial \r\nstage of the Commission. \r\n In the course of approximately 50 formal and \r\ninformal meetings and briefings held in various \r\nconfigurations, the Peacebuilding Commission \r\naddressed critical organizational, methodological and \r\nthematic issues, as well as country-specific issues \r\nrelating to Burundi and Sierra Leone, coordinating \r\nvarious contributions to sustainable peace and opening \r\navenues for mutual commitments between the \r\ninternational community and the countries under \r\nconsideration. I believe that, in its first year, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission contributed significantly to \r\nthe promotion of integrated post-conflict peacebuilding \r\nstrategies in Burundi and Sierra Leone. \r\n In addition, the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nsought to accumulate best practices and lessons on \r\ncritical peacebuilding issues. By establishing the \r\nWorking Group on Lessons Learned, the Commission \r\nwas able to benefit from existing experience in peace \r\nconsolidation in many parts of the world. \r\n As clearly underlined in its first annual report, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission faced tremendous \r\nchallenges during its initial phase involving \r\nestablishing its organizational structures, defining its \r\nworking methods and finding ways to fulfil its core \r\nmandates. Some of these challenges are likely to be the \r\nsubject of additional discussion during the second \r\nsession. The “Conclusions” part of the report contains \r\nserious reflection on key outstanding issues and \r\nchallenges before the Commission, including the \r\nquestion of financing its field missions. \r\n The United Nations peacebuilding architecture is \r\nnow in place and the Peacebuilding Commission is \r\nentering its second year of activity. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s activities need to be carried out in a \r\ncoherent manner. We believe that it may be appropriate \r\nfor the Commission to begin addressing the addition of \r\nnew countries for its consideration, in close \r\nconsultation with the referring bodies. \r\n Strengthening the Commission’s relationship with \r\nrelevant bodies and actors, such as the United Nations’ \r\nprincipal organs, namely, the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the Secretariat, funds and programmes, regional \r\nand subregional organizations, international financial \r\ninstitutions and civil society, is essential. As part of \r\nsuch efforts, I, as this year’s Chairman of the \r\nCommission, will devote constant efforts and avail \r\nmyself of every opportunity to establish closer working \r\nrelationships with those organizations. \r\n Exploring thematic issues relevant to \r\npeacebuilding is also a matter of great importance. I \r\nam particularly convinced that discussing broad policy \r\nguidelines on peacebuilding activities in general, \r\nwithout focusing on a specific country, is also worth \r\npursuing. \r\n Raising awareness of the Commission’s work, not \r\nonly among relevant actors but also among the public \r\nat large, would greatly enhance the understanding of \r\nand necessary attention to the work of the Commission \r\nand the countries under its consideration. In this \r\nregard, we intend to make every effort to heighten the \r\nvisibility of the Commission’s work. At the same time, \r\nwe would hope that individual Member States will join \r\nour efforts to promote the work of the Commission. \r\n As Chairman of the Commission, I would like to \r\nassure all Members of our full dedication and \r\ncommitment to the real success of the Commission, \r\nthat is to say, making change in the field. In that spirit, \r\nwe request all of you to lend your valuable and much \r\nneeded support to our work at the Commission. \r\n I would like to add just a few words in my \r\ncapacity as Permanent Representative of Japan. Japan \r\nhas provided very active support for the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Fund. It coordinates its activities \r\nwith those of the Commission. Recently, we sent  \r\nhigh-level missions to Burundi and Sierra Leone, \r\nheaded by then Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nMr. Hamada, for the purpose of enhancing the \r\npeacebuilding process in those two countries, and a \r\nreport on his visit to Sierra Leone was compiled for the \r\nCommission’s forthcoming discussion. Japan shares \r\nthe views of the Commission in its annual report with \r\nregard to the critical priority areas, and we have \r\naccordingly provided those countries with development \r\nassistance in fields such as basic infrastructure. Our \r\nactivities have included the rehabilitation of power \r\nplants in Sierra Leone and community development in \r\nBurundi. \r\n Japan accords high priorities to post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding efforts. Last month, the Japanese \r\nGovernment contributed to these efforts by launching a \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 4 \r\n \r\nnew programme for training civilian peacebuilding \r\nprofessionals from Japan and also other Asian \r\ncountries. The training takes place in Hiroshima and \r\nmany other places in the world. \r\n Japan will redouble its efforts to achieve the \r\nCommission’s goal of building and consolidating \r\nsustainable peace by hosting the fourth Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development and \r\nthe G-8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit. \r\n Mr. Salgueiro (Portugal): I have the honour of \r\nspeaking on behalf of the European Union and the \r\ncandidate countries of Turkey, Croatia, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, as well as \r\nUkraine, Georgia and Armenia, align themselves with \r\nthis statement. \r\n The European Union would like to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, for organizing this important \r\ndebate. The Peacebuilding Commission is a key \r\nachievement of the United Nations reform process. \r\nCreated to address a gap in the United Nations system \r\nto support countries emerging from conflict, this new \r\nadvisory body, together with the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, has provided an innovative institutional \r\nframework within which the Governments concerned, \r\nthe international community and civil society have \r\nbegun to address some key peacebuilding issues.  \r\n This was made possible thanks to the \r\ncommitment of the previous Chairpersons of the \r\nOrganizational Committee of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins and \r\nAmbassador Kenzo Oshima, the two Vice-Chairpersons \r\nand the two Chairpersons of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations. The European Union would like to \r\ncongratulate them for their valuable work and for the \r\nprogress achieved under their leadership. \r\n We would also like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Yukio Takasu for his recent election as \r\nChairperson of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nwish him all the success for his mandate. The European \r\nUnion looks forward to the Commission having a real \r\nimpact on the ground, including by bringing about \r\ngreater coherence in international efforts to build \r\npeace. \r\n The reports of both the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (A/62/137) and the Peacebuilding Fund \r\n(A/62/138) submitted to the General Assembly stress \r\nthat consolidation of peace must be based on national \r\nownership and international partnership. The European \r\nUnion agrees that efforts to consolidate peace and \r\ndevelopment must be based on the needs and \r\nperspectives of the affected countries themselves. \r\nExperience shows that a nationally owned and led \r\nprocess is the veritable key to success of peacebuilding \r\nand ultimately of sustainable peace. Experience equally \r\nshows that an inclusive and participatory peacebuilding \r\nprocess is the only way to ensure nationwide shared \r\npriority-setting and nation-building, a truthful \r\ncorrespondence between real needs and external \r\nassistance, and a sustained conformity between \r\ncommitments and implementation. \r\n In this sense, it is crucial to engage all \r\nstakeholders, including national civil society, the \r\nprivate sector, Governments, non-governmental \r\norganizations and current and potential donors. Close \r\ncoordination between United Nations Headquarters and \r\nthe national actors is essential in order to identify the \r\nmost pressing priorities, such as good governance, \r\nyouth empowerment, job creation, the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, gender, rule of law and \r\njustice or security sector reform. \r\n In order to ensure that peacebuilding efforts are \r\nsustainable, they should be monitored and tracked with \r\nquantitative and qualitative indicators at the strategic \r\nlevel to assess progress towards agreed goals, to take \r\nappropriate action when threats to peace arise, to \r\nenhance coherence of multidimensional efforts and to \r\ntrack fulfilment of mutual commitments by national \r\nand international actors. In this context, the Working \r\nGroup on Lessons Learned should help the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission apply best practices to its \r\nwork at the field level. Additionally, in order to \r\nmaximize the Commission’s positive impact on the \r\nground, we believe that the link between Headquarters \r\nand the field should be strengthened. Where possible, \r\nrepresentatives from the field should participate in the \r\nCommission’s discussions in New York via video \r\nconference or in person, not just to brief the \r\nCommission, but also to engage in the assessment of \r\nprogress and the detailing of next steps to be taken. In \r\naddition to existing coordination meetings, \r\nCommission meetings could also be held in-country so \r\nthat more actors can be involved. \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n5 07-53720 \r\n \r\n Another priority that would enable the \r\nCommission to consolidate its added value and \r\nmaximize its impact would be to increase its visibility \r\nin the field through improved outreach and \r\ncommunication strategies as well as greater publicity. \r\nAlso, we are of the opinion that the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office needs to be equipped with the adequate \r\nresources necessary to continue to efficiently support \r\nthe Commission’s growing work.  \r\n The European Union welcomes the engagement \r\nthat the Peacebuilding Commission has shown in \r\nSierra Leone and Burundi in the past year. We \r\ncommend the intensive work of all stakeholders that \r\nhave contributed to the Strategic Framework for \r\npeacebuilding in Burundi and consider it a critical \r\ninstrument providing guidance for the Government of \r\nBurundi, the Commission itself, and all partners for \r\ntheir common work in peacebuilding. We underline the \r\nimportance of the monitoring and tracking mechanism \r\nthat is currently being developed between Burundi and \r\nthe Commission to allow for reviewing progress in \r\npeacebuilding activities and objectives on a regular \r\nbasis. Without this mechanism, the Strategic \r\nFramework will not have much impact on the ground. \r\n With regard to Sierra Leone, the European Union \r\nconsiders that the Peacebuilding Commission has made \r\na valuable contribution to enhancing international \r\nattention and financial support and in aiding the overall \r\npeace consolidation process. The European Union \r\nstands ready to continue to assist in the finalization of \r\nthe Sierra Leone Compact and in developing tools to \r\ntrack progress. The Commission should ensure that the \r\npeacebuilding process remains on track and that gaps \r\nare addressed in a timely and coherent manner. The \r\nEuropean Union believes that the Compact should \r\nbuild on existing frameworks, such as the Poverty \r\nReduction Strategy Paper, the Peace Consolidation \r\nStrategy and the frameworks of assistance of other \r\nmain donors. We have to ensure the optimal \r\narticulation of these frameworks while highlighting \r\nnational and international commitments and \r\nencouraging their implementation. \r\n The fact that the monitoring and tracking \r\nmechanism of the Strategic Framework for \r\npeacebuilding in Burundi will be based to the extent \r\npossible on the monitoring mechanism and timelines of \r\nthe Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is an \r\nencouraging development in the right direction. In this \r\ncontext, the European Community, as a main \r\nmultilateral donor in both Burundi and Sierra Leone, \r\nstands ready to work constructively towards this end at \r\nthe strategic and field level. \r\n The European Union recognizes the importance \r\nof sustained and predictable financing for \r\npeacebuilding. The Peacebuilding Fund, in operation \r\nsince January 2007, plays a critical role in providing \r\ncountries with start-up funding for early recovery. The \r\nEuropean Union member States have been contributing \r\nto this Fund, and the Union is collectively its largest \r\ndonor. It is important to ensure that additional \r\ncountries are declared eligible for support from the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and that mobilization of resources \r\nis enhanced in order to achieve the $250 million \r\nfunding target and to effectively address the transition \r\ngap. \r\n The European Union sees the Peacebuilding Fund \r\nas a catalyst for work on peacebuilding efforts, but \r\nlong-term funding must still come from multilateral \r\nand bilateral donors. The scope of the Fund should not \r\noverlap with other existing instruments. In order to \r\nensure broad and effective use of the Fund, all of its \r\nthree funding windows should be fully utilized. The \r\nrole of the Peacebuilding Fund Advisory Group can be \r\nparticularly helpful in providing guidance on the \r\neffective use of the funds. \r\n As recognized in both reports, it is crucial that \r\nthe distinction between the Peacebuilding Fund and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is clarified for all the \r\nparties involved in peacebuilding from the outset of the \r\nprocess. We should further reflect on the \r\ninterrelationship between the Commission and the \r\nFund, in particular what the sequencing is between \r\nthem and how to link short-term early interventions \r\nwith a long-term strategy. \r\n The European Union’s assessment of the first \r\nyear of the Peacebuilding Commission is positive. At \r\nthe same time, we are aware of the major challenges \r\nthat still lie ahead. The Commission must prove its \r\nability to deliver real benefits to the countries under its \r\nconsideration. Effective working practices for the \r\nCommission’s relationship with other United Nations \r\nbodies also need to be established. The Commission’s \r\nrelationship with the Security Council, the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nBretton Woods institutions should be enhanced, and \r\nthose organs, in particular the Security Council, should \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 6 \r\n \r\ntake better advantage of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s advisory role.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission can consider new \r\ncountries in its second year. At least one country has \r\nalready expressed its wish to be included in the \r\nCommission’s agenda. The Commission should ensure \r\nthat it has the capabilities to address those countries, in \r\nterms of human resources and capacity, and that it has \r\nlearned the lessons from its experiences with Burundi \r\nand Sierra Leone. The Peacebuilding Commission \r\nshould also continue its reflections on the appropriate \r\ntime for scaling down and ending the Commission’s \r\nengagement with a country.  \r\n To conclude, the European Union will maintain \r\nits positive contribution to the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We are determined to help \r\nthe Commission make a positive and measurable \r\nimpact in the regions where it is engaged. In this \r\ncontext, we stress the importance of the standing \r\ninvitation extended to the European Community as an \r\ninstitutional donor to participate in the meetings of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We look forward to the \r\narrangement finally implemented, allowing for \r\nadequate representation of the European Union, given \r\nthe major contributions that the Union, as an \r\ninternational actor, makes in a number of post-conflict \r\ncountries and regions worldwide, particularly in the \r\nareas of diplomacy, military and security. \r\n Mrs. Angella Brown (Jamaica): Please allow me, \r\nSir, on behalf of the caucus of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM) in the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nto extend sincere congratulations to you on your \r\nelection to the presidency of this body. We are \r\nconfident that under your able leadership the General \r\nAssembly will complete its slate of activities in a \r\ncordial, efficient and professional manner \r\ncommensurate with the high office of the presidency \r\nand the expectations of the many delegations which \r\nmake up this Organization. \r\n The report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(A/62/137) to the Assembly, as mandated by the \r\nfounding resolutions — General Assembly resolution \r\n60/180 and Security Council resolution 1646 (2005) — \r\nis a strong signal that the latest initiatives in the United \r\nNations reform process are under way, in earnest. The \r\ncompletion of its first year in operation and the \r\npresentation of this report to the Assembly not only is a \r\ndefining moment in the existence of the Commission, \r\nbut will also form a solid basis for work to move \r\nforward and add another facet to the already existing \r\nbody of knowledge, aiding in the consolidation of \r\npeace and laying the foundation for the immediate \r\nrehabilitation and sustained economic recovery and \r\ndevelopment of the post-conflict countries under \r\nconsideration. \r\n Throughout the preceding 12 months, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission successfully grappled with \r\nseveral administrative, organizational and directional \r\nissues as it sought to establish itself and fulfil its \r\nmandate, catering for the peacebuilding needs of \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone, the first two countries under \r\nits consideration. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement caucus in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is particularly pleased with \r\nthe comprehensive character of the content of the \r\nreport, which in our estimation represents a factual and \r\nfaithful account of what transpired over the period and \r\nin so doing, provides an accurate record of the \r\nCommission’s work for posterity. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement continues to \r\nemphasize that the development aspects of any strategy \r\ngeared towards extricating countries emerging from \r\nconflict cannot be over emphasized. The Movement \r\nstrongly agrees that the Peacebuilding Commission \r\ncannot ignore fundamental principles such as the rule \r\nof law, security sector reform and human rights. But \r\ncertainly those principles cannot be emphasized at the \r\nexpense of providing immediate post-conflict risk-\r\nreduction strategies, which is the precise and direct \r\npurpose of the Commission. Such strategies are geared \r\ntowards poverty reduction and include education and \r\ntraining, rural agricultural development, private sector \r\nreform and other capacity-building initiatives, \r\nincluding the creation of an investor-friendly \r\nclimate — all of which lead towards job creation, \r\ntogether with enhanced employment opportunities and, \r\nby extension, overall improvement in the lives and \r\nliving conditions of local populations. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement looks forward to the \r\ncontinuation of the dialogue within the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission as we continue to build on the successes \r\nof the past months, always mindful that the countries \r\nunder consideration by the Commission require swift \r\naction to implement priority projects as part of the \r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction process. \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n7 07-53720 \r\n \r\n Additionally, the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nmust continue to identify the means by which funds \r\nthat are approved for disbursement by the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund reach the recipient countries in the \r\nshortest possible time. It is not sufficient to identify the \r\nurgency of the need while paying scant regard to or \r\nbecoming lax in the critical follow-up actions at the \r\nmost crucial stage of the process.  \r\n The second year of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will demand close coordination between \r\nthe Commission, other United Nations bodies, the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and donor countries and agencies, \r\nparticularly those on the ground in post-conflict \r\nsituations, if some of the pitfalls of the recent months \r\nare to be avoided. It is also important that the \r\nCommission continue its work in the next months with \r\nthe same level of commitment, dedication and drive \r\nthat was evident during the period under review. In that \r\nconnection, the Non-Aligned Movement would like to \r\nreiterate several key principles which should continue \r\nto guide the Commission’s work. \r\n While we welcome the commitment of the donor \r\ncommunity in the activities of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, the Commission is not a donor \r\norganization. Its activities involving all stakeholders \r\nmust be executed in a far broader, more comprehensive \r\nand participatory context consistent with its mandate. \r\nDecisions regarding the provision of financial \r\nresources should, therefore, be guided by national \r\npriorities and be based on the collective decision of \r\nmembers of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nRecommendations for assistance must highlight the \r\npriority areas established by the Government of the \r\ncountry under review by the Commission. The matter \r\nof Government guidance should also be uppermost in \r\nplanning the way forward and will certainly serve to \r\nstrengthen the process of national ownership. This \r\nholistic and inclusive approach to evaluation and \r\nrecommendations adopted at country-specific meetings \r\ncan only add to the integrity of the process within the \r\nCommission. \r\n We believe that, with the architecture of the \r\nCommission now completed, its work should take on \r\nanother dimension as it responds to the expectations of \r\nthe international community, particularly those of \r\ncountries emerging from conflict, by producing \r\ntangible results with greater and more robust activities \r\nin the coming months, including the addition of more \r\ncountries for consideration as they try to consolidate \r\npeace and engineer prosperity. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement caucus in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission calls for the streamlining of \r\nthe meetings of the Commission. We must move to \r\ndispel the misconception that, because of its different \r\nconfigurations, there is more that one Commission. In \r\nthis regard, the Organizational Committee must be the \r\nfocal point of all Commission activities, including the \r\nwork of the country-specific meetings. \r\n Finally, the NAM continues to pay tribute to \r\nAngola, the first Chair of the Commission, under \r\nwhose guidance the achievements of the Commission \r\nduring the initial stage were accomplished. \r\n Please allow me to also express appreciation to \r\nthe respective chairs of the country-specific meetings \r\nand the Peacebuilding Support Office for their tireless \r\nefforts and excellent contributions during the first \r\nsession of the Commission. \r\n We also take this opportunity to welcome and \r\nextend best wishes to Japan, the new Chair of the \r\nCommission, and other incoming members of the new \r\nBureau of the Commission. \r\n Mr. Akram (Pakistan): The decision to establish \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission taken by the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit was a belated but important recognition \r\nof the need for a comprehensive approach to peace and \r\nthe inextricable relationship between peace and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n As a founding member of the Commission, \r\nPakistan has had the privilege of contributing to its \r\nwork in its formative phase. We are deeply committed \r\nto the Commission’s success. I would like to thank \r\nAmbassador Martins of Angola for skilfully guiding \r\nthe work of the Commission during its first year. We \r\nare also thankful to Ambassador Løvald of Norway and \r\nAmbassador Frank Majoor of the Netherlands for \r\ncoordinating the Commission’s work in the country-\r\nspecific formats on Burundi and Sierra Leone, as well \r\nas to Ambassador Gallardo of El Salvador for his \r\nuseful work as chair of the Working Group on Lessons \r\nLearned. We also assure our full support to the new \r\nChair of the Commission, Ambassador Yukio Takasu of \r\nJapan, who has already displayed his energy in \r\npromoting the work of the Commission. Let me finally \r\nthank the Peacebuilding Support Office for their \r\nimportant contribution to the work of the Commission. \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 8 \r\n \r\n During the first year, the main focus of the \r\nCommission was on peacebuilding in the two countries \r\non its agenda, that is, Burundi and Sierra Leone. \r\nSubstantive work has been done on the two situations, \r\nincluding the elaboration of integrated strategies, \r\nwhich are to form the framework for the Commission’s \r\nengagement with the two countries. The process was \r\ninformed and driven by national ownership and by \r\nconsultations and initiatives at the field level. The \r\nCommission undertook field visits to the two countries. \r\nThe contribution of the United Nations integrated \r\noffices in Burundi and Sierra Leone was also crucial in \r\nthis process. \r\n Apart from describing the Commission’s work, \r\nthe report of the Commission offers observations and \r\nrecommendations on outstanding issues and \r\nchallenges. Since this is formative phase of the \r\nCommission, it may be too early to start measuring its \r\nreal impact or evaluating its work in terms of success \r\nor failure. Its performance, during the first year, \r\nconsidering the inherent difficulties and the differences \r\nof opinion and expectations that characterized the \r\nevolutionary discussions of the Commission, is by all \r\nmeans commendable. We believe that despite “teething \r\nproblems”, good groundwork has been done with \r\nregard to the organizational and substantive agenda. \r\nBuilding on this, we hope that the Commission will be \r\nable to improve its output in both quality and quantity \r\nin the coming years. \r\n The Commission also faces several challenges: \r\npolitical, conceptual, organizational and functional. \r\nFrom the outset, there has been an effort on the part of \r\nsome to keep the Commission closely tied to and, \r\nindeed, subservient to the Security Council. The \r\nresulting friction could have been avoided if the \r\nCommission’s relationship with the three principal \r\norgans had been more clearly defined in the founding \r\nresolutions. We hope that the Commission’s work will \r\nevolve with much greater appreciation for the value of \r\ncollaborative and complementary efforts by the three \r\nprincipal organs. Indeed, it was this need for such a \r\ncomplementary arrangement that served as the rational \r\nfor the creation of the Commission. \r\n Another problem has been the effort to reduce the \r\nrole of the Organizational Committee. We agree that \r\nmost of the work should take place in the country-\r\nspecific formats. Indeed, this was the concept \r\npromoted in Pakistan’s 2004 proposal for the creation \r\nof ad-hoc composite committees. However, once we all \r\nagreed to establish the Organizational Committee, this \r\nCommittee should be accorded its due place and be \r\nfully utilized. It should have a strategic oversight of the \r\nwork of the Commission, including country-specific \r\nmeetings and the Working Group on Lessons Learned. \r\nThe Committee should meet more frequently. The \r\nCommittee and its chair should be the primary \r\ninterface of the Commission with all external actors, \r\nparticularly the principal organs, institutional donors \r\nand others. The country-specific formats, designed to \r\ngenerate maximum efficiency and flexibility, should \r\nnot appear to bypass the Organizational Committee.  \r\n Neither should the Commission turn into another \r\nforum for donors and recipients. One casualty of such a \r\ndevelopment would be national ownership on the part \r\nof the countries under consideration, and a much \r\nbigger casualty could be the Commission itself. \r\n Demands for onerous commitments on the part of \r\nthe countries on the agenda, introduction of conditions \r\nand multiple scrutiny will shift the Commission from \r\nits main task of assisting these countries which are, \r\nafter all, faced with special circumstances. We have \r\nseen, for instance, in the discussion on the strategic \r\nframework for Burundi, that, while commitments were \r\nexpected from the country concerned, there was \r\nreluctance, on the part of the partners, to agree to \r\nconcrete commitments themselves. \r\n On the operational side, the main objective \r\nshould be to maximize the Commission’s impact on the \r\nground. Increased system-wide approach and \r\ncoordination is the key to assisting the transition from \r\nconflict to sustainable peace and development. We \r\nmust not forget that these are complex crises. They \r\nmust be addressed comprehensively, in all their \r\naspects — political, security, economic, social and \r\nhumanitarian. It is also necessary to address the root \r\ncauses in order to effectively prevent relapse into \r\nconflict. \r\n The line between peacebuilding and development \r\nis not always clear. Still, there is a need to strike a \r\nbalance between immediate peacebuilding activities \r\nand longer-term development priorities. Trade, \r\ninvestment, official development assistance, debt relief \r\nand development of the private sector have to be part \r\nof the peacebuilding programme. \r\n Sustainable peace and development cannot be \r\nensured without moving a country towards self-\r\nsufficiency and reducing its reliance on external \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n9 07-53720 \r\n \r\nassistance. The best utilization of the country’s own \r\nresources should be promoted, inter alia, through trade \r\nand value addition of raw materials. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission held around 50 \r\nmeetings in different formats during the first year. This \r\nkind of attention given to the two countries on its \r\nagenda would not have been possible in the Security \r\nCouncil, which can only address issues periodically. It \r\nis for this reason that we had earlier proposed that the \r\ncomprehensive reports of the two Integrated Offices in \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone should be considered in the \r\nCommission as well. This would improve coordination \r\nbetween the field and headquarters. \r\n There is a need also to make the most effective \r\nuse of the Peacebuilding Commission’s advice and \r\nrecommendations. The Commission is a unique \r\nmechanism in the sense that all actors are around the \r\ntable. This should translate into better communication \r\nand swift action by all concerned. It is important to see \r\nalso how the advice of the Commission is influencing \r\nthe work and decisions of relevant actors. The advice \r\nof the Commission can be accorded more weight and \r\ngreater sanction if it is subsequently incorporated and \r\nreflected in the decisions of the principal organs. \r\n The international financial institutions, for their \r\npart, should demonstrate greater operational flexibility \r\nin their interactions with and assistance to the countries \r\nunder consideration. \r\n The advocacy role of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission needs to be further strengthened to \r\nmarshal resources, help ensure predictable financing \r\nand ensure the continued attention of the international \r\ncommunity on the country concerned. The assistance \r\ncan be made readily available through the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, which is invaluable. However, \r\nsuch assistance is intended to be of immediate or short-\r\nterm nature. It is therefore important to enhance the \r\ncatalytic impact of the interventions of the Fund, \r\nincluding assistance provided through its emergency \r\nwindow. But it should be recognized that much larger \r\nresources are required and on a sustained basis to carry \r\nout the agreed objectives, plans and programmes \r\nrelated to peacebuilding in the countries concerned. \r\nThe Commission is best placed to help mobilize these \r\nresources through other established mechanisms \r\nincluding donor conferences. The principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations can all help in this resource-\r\ngeneration effort. \r\n Coordination and exchange of information, \r\nincluding lessons learned, between the Fund and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission are vital for a proper \r\nperspective and success of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. It may be a good idea to arrange close \r\ninteraction between the members of the Commission \r\nand the Fund’s Advisory Group. \r\n In the final analysis, the key to success lies in \r\nimplementation and follow-up. Peacebuilding strategic \r\nframeworks are the common platform for our work. \r\nThey will need to be complemented by agreed \r\nmonitoring and tracking mechanisms with regard to the \r\ncommitments of both the countries concerned and the \r\ninternational community. We will thus have live \r\nstrategies, which will allow fine-tuning and course \r\ncorrection, responding to critical gaps and \r\nrequirements as they arise. \r\n The mapping of completed, current and planned \r\nactivities and the overall resource flows remains an \r\nimportant ongoing exercise. Typical challenges of \r\nexternal resource mobilization have been identified in \r\nthe mapping exercises carried out by the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office. This should help identify gaps and \r\npotential partners and mechanisms to address them. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to say that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has shown great promise. \r\nIts efforts during the first year have been generally \r\nappreciated, including by the two countries on its \r\nagenda. This should encourage other countries to seek \r\nthe advice and assistance of the Commission. Pakistan \r\nbelieves that the Peacebuilding Commission is capable \r\nof addressing complex crises in several additional \r\ncountries. The international community has the \r\nresources and the capacity to address the challenges \r\nthat are being confronted by so many countries caught \r\nin the vortex of the problems and politics of scarcity. \r\nUltimately, it is poverty and scarcity which must be \r\nconquered comprehensively in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and in the other relevant organs and \r\nbodies at the disposal of the international community. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): It is my \r\npleasure to commence my statement by thanking the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Secretary-General \r\nfor the presentation of the first annual report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission on its first session \r\n(A/62/137) and the report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund (A/62/138). \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 10 \r\n \r\n Convinced of the important role to be played by \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission in preventing countries \r\nfrom relapsing into conflict after a post-conflict stage, \r\nEgypt sought to become a member of the Commission \r\nfrom its establishment and to have it implement its \r\ntasks in accordance with General Assembly resolution \r\n60/180 in a manner that would achieve the best \r\npossible results. \r\n The first annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (A/62/137) outlines the achievements of \r\nthe Commission during its first year, in addition to all \r\nrelated substantive and procedural aspects. \r\nAccordingly, the General Assembly should assess the \r\npros and cons and make recommendations designed to \r\nenhance the roles of the Organizational Committee, the \r\ncountry-specific configurations of Sierra Leone and \r\nBurundi and the Working Group on Lessons Learned to \r\nenable them to carry out their mandates in the optimum \r\nmanner. \r\n It is necessary to ensure that the Commission \r\ncontinues to work actively on bringing together all \r\nrelevant actors and that it provides recommendations \r\nand suggestions based on in-depth studies in order to \r\nadopt and implement integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies and to consolidate foundations for \r\nsustainable development in the countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict. This requires the Commission to \r\nstrengthen its relations with various relevant organs, \r\ndepartments and programmes of the United Nations as \r\nwell as with the international financial institutions, \r\ndonor countries and regional and subregional \r\norganizations concerned with peacebuilding, \r\nparticularly those existing in the same regions as the \r\ncountries that are under the Commission’s \r\nconsideration. \r\n Consequently, it is imperative for the \r\nCommission to develop its tools of engagement with \r\nthe countries on its agenda. In this regard, I wish to \r\nemphasize the usefulness of field missions, which, by \r\nfacilitating direct dialogue with Governments, \r\nParliaments, civil society and the private sector, make \r\nit possible to obtain first-hand information and directly \r\nassess peacebuilding priorities. \r\n Experience has demonstrated the importance of \r\nthe continued promotion by the Commission of its \r\ninstitutional relationships with the General Assembly, \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. These relationships still need further \r\ndelineation and clarification, in a spirit of full respect \r\nfor the institutional balance between these organs in \r\naccordance with their Charter responsibilities. \r\nFurthermore, the provisional rules of procedure of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission need to be continually \r\nrevisited in the light of developments and experience \r\ngained from the work of the Commission during its \r\nfirst year, with a view to the formulation of clear \r\ninstitutional rules and unified criteria that have not \r\nbeen influenced by political considerations and the \r\nreflection of all the cases under consideration. \r\n The Commission should not only focus its work \r\non the country-specific meetings, but it should also \r\nenhance the institutional role of the Organizational \r\nCommittee with the aim of promoting debate on \r\nspecific subjects and the refinement of regulations and \r\nprocedures related to the rules and working methods of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, taking into account the \r\nfindings of the Working Group on Lessons Learned. \r\n In order that our efforts may succeed, the \r\nCommission should ensure, while pursuing its work, \r\nfull respect for and adherence to its main principles, \r\nparticularly the principle of national ownership of the \r\ncountries under consideration by the Commission. This \r\nprinciple should be applied to the planning, \r\nimplementation and termination of the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in the country concerned, \r\nbased on a sovereign national decision by the country \r\nconcerned without any political or financial pressure. \r\nMoreover, monitoring and follow-up mechanisms \r\nshould be established to ensure that national and \r\ninternational stakeholders abide by their commitments \r\nrelated to peacebuilding priorities agreed between the \r\nCommission and the countries concerned. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission should not act as \r\na “trusteeship commission” passing judgement on the \r\ncapabilities of countries emerging from conflict, nor as \r\na mediator seeking to gather donor and recipient \r\ncountries together, nor as a club for donors, which \r\nmight lead to the marginalization of the role of \r\nnon-donor countries members of the Commission. \r\nAccordingly, the Commission should undertake an \r\nin-depth study of the role of the steering committees \r\nthat review and adopt projects to be incorporated in the \r\npriority plans of each of the countries concerned. The \r\nCommission should also specify the unified criteria \r\nthat these committees should adhere to while reviewing \r\nthe projects to be submitted to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission for adoption, so as not to give the donors \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n11 07-53720 \r\n \r\nthe chance to impose any conditionalities for agreeing \r\non these projects, which would constrain the \r\nsovereignty of the country concerned and the \r\nindependence of its national decisions. \r\n The General Assembly should also fully support \r\nthe secretariat of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nprovide it with the necessary posts and financial \r\nresources to fulfil its role fully, as well as the financial \r\nresources needed for increasing the number of field \r\nmissions to the countries under consideration by the \r\nCommission. \r\n In the light of Egypt’s persistent support for the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and its goals, we think that \r\ncountries should fulfil their pledges to the budget of \r\nthe Fund, especially since the Fund has received only \r\n$142 million out of the $226 million pledged by 34 \r\ncountries. It is estimated that the budget of the Fund \r\nshould be $250 million. Delays or non-fulfilment of the \r\npledges will hinder the Fund from performing its \r\nfunctions. \r\n In this regard, it is essential to explain the \r\nrelation between the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund. Despite the fact that the Fund \r\nis independent and works under the authority of the \r\nSecretary-General, its name — Peacebuilding Fund — \r\nshows that more coordination and coherence is needed \r\nbetween its activities and the activities of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, especially since several \r\ncountries consider that the Fund has become a forum \r\nconnecting the Secretary-General with the donor \r\ncountries, separate from the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. This also requires that the management \r\nof the Fund develop in a way that increases its capacity \r\nto accomplish its work quickly and effectively and to \r\ndisburse the funds allocated to specific projects. In this \r\ncontext, the Commission should insist on issuing \r\nguidance on the general policies of the Fund pursuant \r\nto the terms of reference. \r\n In this connection, we call upon the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to increase consultation with the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in cases where he \r\ndetermines that a country is eligible for Peacebuilding \r\nFund support. It is not enough to notify the \r\nCommission after issuing his decision to disburse \r\nresources from the Fund for one country or another. We \r\nare looking forward to the creation by the Fund of a \r\nmechanism to assess the usefulness of the resources \r\ndisbursed and for reporting on whether those resources \r\nlead to minimizing the possibility of the countries \r\nconcerned relapsing into conflict. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to extend my \r\ncongratulations to the Chairperson of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, Mr. Ismael Gaspar \r\nMartins, the Permanent Representative of Angola, for \r\nthe reporting period. By the same token, we wish to \r\nextend our congratulations to the Ambassadors of the \r\nNetherlands, El Salvador and Norway for the success \r\nof their efforts in guiding the work of the Commission. \r\nWe wish also to congratulate the Peacebuilding Fund \r\non the considerable efforts made last year, as explicitly \r\nreflected in the report. We wish to reiterate our trust \r\nthat the coming period will witness extensive \r\ncooperation between the Peacebuilding Support Office \r\nand the members of the Commission with a view to \r\novercoming the problems that faced the Commission in \r\nits first year. We wish Japan and the new Peacebuilding \r\nCommission members every success in leading the \r\ndeliberations of the Commission next year. \r\n Ms. Jahan (Bangladesh): The Bangladesh \r\ndelegation welcomes this opportunity to deliberate on \r\nthe work of the Peacebuilding Commission during its \r\nfirst year of operation. \r\n We associate ourselves with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement caucus. However, we would \r\nlike to highlight the following points. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission, as we are all \r\naware, was established to address a lacuna in the \r\nUnited Nations structure and thus reduce post-conflict \r\ncountries’ risk of relapsing into the quagmire of \r\nconflict and crisis. With this end in view, the work \r\ndone so far by the Peacebuilding Commission in its \r\nmaiden two ventures in Sierra Leone and Burundi has \r\nmade significant and tangible contributions towards the \r\nconsolidation of peace in these two countries. \r\n Despite being in a nascent stage, the first year of \r\noperation of the Peacebuilding Commission has been \r\nquite satisfactory, given the complexity of its work, the \r\nheavy mandate and the fact that it has had to chart its \r\nown way of functioning and address some critical \r\norganizational, procedural and methodological issues, \r\nin addition to its substantive work of peacebuilding. \r\nThe formulation of country-specific integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies appears to be the right \r\napproach and these strategies, given their \r\nconfiguration, have all the potential to become an \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 12 \r\n \r\neffective tool for peacebuilding. The Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office, the Peacebuilding Fund and the chairs \r\nof the country-specific meetings also deserve their \r\nshare of credit. We commend the countries of Sierra \r\nLeone and Burundi for their cooperation and for taking \r\nnational ownership of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\ninitiatives. \r\n There can be no sense of complacency, however. \r\nThere still remains much scope for improvement. We \r\nare of the view that operational relations of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission with the General Assembly, \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, other intergovernmental United Nations \r\nbodies, relevant international, regional and subregional \r\norganizations, national stakeholders, financiers and \r\ncivil society should be further strengthened. Similarly, \r\noperational relations with the recently restructured \r\nUnited Nations Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations should also be enhanced. The wrangling \r\nwith which the Peacebuilding Commission was faced \r\nin developing its rules of procedure and working \r\nmethods during its early stage of operation should be \r\navoided by further streamlining. The Organizational \r\nCommittee should infuse more dynamism into the \r\npeacebuilding architecture by playing a more pro-\r\nactive and lead role. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission should have a \r\nbuilt-in system for stocktaking, so as to continuously \r\nbuild upon its own achievements of peacebuilding. The \r\nCommission should also develop a tracking and \r\nmonitoring mechanism to feed the tracking functions \r\nof the integrated peacebuilding strategies in order to \r\nassess their accountability and effectiveness. This \r\nwould enable the Commission to make necessary \r\nadjustments in its efforts to have the maximum impact \r\non the ground. The integrated peacebuilding strategies \r\nshould be comprehensive enough to cover all the \r\npeacebuilding priorities. \r\n As the Working Group on Lessons Learned plans \r\nto consider a number of other peacebuilding issues, it \r\nshould devote some time to sharing the valuable \r\npeacekeeping experiences of the troop-contributing \r\ncountries. The lessons learned in that regard should be \r\nduly reflected in the integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies. One of the key factors for success in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s work is the attention of \r\nthe international community to its peacebuilding \r\nactivities in the countries of engagement. The \r\nCommission and its work, therefore, should be given \r\nadequate visibility, through outreach activities, in order \r\nto retain this attention. \r\n My delegation is also of the view that, in the \r\ncases of Burundi and Sierra Leone, the issue of \r\neconomic recovery of the post-conflict societies was \r\nsomewhat less focused on. For furthering the work of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, we believe attention \r\nshould also be given to building pluralistic political \r\ninstitutions, creating peace constituencies, restoring an \r\nenvironment of mutual trust, confidence and tolerance \r\nand establishing a process of societal reconciliation \r\nand healing. \r\n As regards the work of Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, Bangladesh from the very outset has \r\nadvocated the view that post-conflict societies must \r\ntake charge of their own destiny and that the \r\nCommission’s work should be based on national \r\nownership. It is gratifying that the Commission has \r\nsubscribed to an inclusive and nationally driven \r\nprocess aimed at maximizing the involvement of all \r\nrelevant actors on the ground. In addition, to make \r\npeacebuilding initiatives more effective and better \r\nsuited to realities on the ground, we would like the \r\nCommission to include in the integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies domestic initiatives, such as home-grown \r\nideas like microcredit and women’s non-formal \r\neducation, combined with external material support. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission, on the basis of \r\nits operational experience over the first year, has to \r\ndefine the process and timing of disengagement with a \r\ncountry. Before any such disengagement, it should \r\nmake sure to leave behind an integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategy or another mechanism that would make peace \r\nself-sustainable even after disengagement. At the same \r\ntime, the Commission has to expand its operations and \r\nchalk out a procedure and basis for the selection of \r\nnew countries. \r\n We feel that members of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission should be more frequently updated on the \r\noperations of the Peacebuilding Fund and that \r\ninformation on disbursements must be shared with \r\nadequate lead time. The relationship between the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, and their individual roles, have to be made clear \r\nto the stakeholders on the ground in order to dispel \r\nconfusion as regards eligibility for Peacebuilding Fund \r\nsupport. \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n13 07-53720 \r\n \r\n For the Peacebuilding Commission, it is just the \r\nbeginning of a long and arduous journey. As more \r\ncountries are brought under its consideration, the \r\nexpectation, responsibilities and complexities of its \r\nworkload will become heavier. To cope with that, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and its supporting bodies \r\nrequire incremental political and material support. We, \r\nas a member of the Commission, would expect the \r\ninternational community to come forward to assist us \r\nin fulfilling our mandate. \r\n It would be grossly remiss of me not to place on \r\nrecord our special tribute to Ambassador Ismael Gaspar \r\nMartins of Angola, the first Chair of the Commission, \r\nfor his wise stewardship, especially at the initial stages \r\nof the Commission’s work. I also take this opportunity \r\nto convey our thanks to Ambassador Johan Løvald of \r\nNorway and Ambassador Frank Majoor of the \r\nNetherlands for coordinating the country-specific \r\nmandate of the Commission. Our thanks go also to \r\nAmbassador Carmen María Gallardo Hernández of \r\nEl Salvador for her stewardship of the Working Group \r\non Lessons Learned. \r\n In closing, I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to welcome and extend the full support of \r\nmy delegation to the new Chair, Ambassador Yukio \r\nTakasu. \r\n Mr. Matussek (Germany): Let me say first of all \r\nthat Germany fully supports the statement made by the \r\nPortuguese presidency of the European Union on \r\nbehalf of the Union. \r\n Let me thank all those who contributed so greatly \r\nto the success of the Peacebuilding Commission in its \r\nfirst session. Let me specifically thank the first \r\nChairman of the Organizational Committee of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, Ambassador Gaspar \r\nMartins of Angola, as well as the two Vice-Chairs, \r\nAmbassador Gallardo Hernández of El Salvador and \r\nAmbassador Løvald of Norway. Let me also commend \r\nAssistant Secretary-General Carolyn McAskie and her \r\ncolleagues in the Peacebuilding Support Office for the \r\nexcellent work done. I would also like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Takasu on his election as Chairman of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission; I want to wish him all \r\nsuccess in his work. \r\n Today’s debate on the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s first year of work will help us to \r\nevaluate the work done and the results achieved so far, \r\nand decide on the way forward for the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly and the second year \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is part of the important reforms of the \r\nUnited Nations. World leaders, at the 2005 World \r\nSummit, recognized that international peacebuilding \r\nefforts lacked an overall strategic approach and \r\ncoherence. Countries emerging from conflict face a \r\nunique challenge and a high risk of relapsing into \r\nviolence. The Peacebuilding Commission assists those \r\ncountries in laying the foundations for sustainable \r\npeace and development. \r\n The first year of work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission was a difficult one. The Commission had \r\nto find out how to approach its tasks and how to \r\napproach its workload. Provisional rules of procedure \r\nfor the Commission were adopted after a long \r\nconsultative process among member States. In \r\naddition, a provisional formula was found to ensure the \r\nactive and productive participation of civil society, \r\nincluding non-governmental organizations, in the work \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. From our point of \r\nview, that was an important step. Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone were placed on the agenda of the Commission. \r\nThe work in the country-specific meetings included, \r\ninter alia, field missions, many videoconferences, \r\nspecial briefings and, last but not least, the formulation \r\nof integrated peacebuilding strategies. \r\n The report of the Peacebuilding Commission on \r\nits first session (A/62/137) provides us with \r\nrecommendations on what we should try to achieve \r\nduring second session: to maximize the Commission’s \r\nimpact on the ground and improve interaction with the \r\nfield; to ensure that the current peacebuilding \r\nprocesses remain on track; to develop monitoring \r\nmechanisms for the integrated peacebuilding strategies; \r\nand finally, to ensure that challenges and gaps are \r\naddressed in a timely and coherent manner. \r\n In addition, I would like to emphasize some \r\nspecific issues we should look at in the second year of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n The first is the issue of coordination. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office should strengthen their capacity to \r\nmake recommendations and to provide information in \r\norder to improve the coordination of all relevant actors \r\nwithin and outside the United Nations. \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 14 \r\n \r\n The second is the issue of lessons learned. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission should broaden its agenda \r\nby intensifying dialogue on general peacebuilding \r\nissues, such as security sector reform and post-conflict \r\nnational reconciliation, and should draw lessons \r\nlearned from past experiences. The Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned is a promising first step in that regard. \r\n The third is the issue of strategies. The \r\nengagement of the Peacebuilding Commission in \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone is being felt. Discussions \r\nand visits have facilitated the coming together of key \r\nstakeholders. The critical threats to the peace process \r\nin both countries have been addressed in the integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies. The next step should be \r\nstrengthening the relevance of the strategies as a tool to \r\ngenerate enhanced support for peacebuilding in \r\nBurundi, Sierra Leone and other countries. \r\n The fourth is adding real value. Most important is \r\nthat the Peacebuilding Commission adds real value and \r\ndoes not duplicate efforts in the task of supporting \r\nspecific countries in building peace. Integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies should set the decisive \r\nframeworks for international and national \r\npeacebuilding in those countries where the \r\nCommission will take a supportive stance. \r\n Those are my main suggestions for our work \r\nduring the second year of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Achieving stable peace and an effective \r\nsettlement of armed conflicts is possible only on the \r\nbasis of a comprehensive strategic approach and \r\nagreement. The transition to sustainable socio-\r\neconomic recovery is accompanied by many \r\ndifficulties. The danger of renewed conflict is always \r\npresent in societies where the original causes of the \r\ncrisis have not been eliminated. \r\n Countries that have emerged from armed conflict \r\nshould not find themselves plunged into crisis. That is \r\nwhere they must be effectively helped by the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, whose creation, by parallel \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, was one of the important achievements in the \r\nreform of the Organization in accordance with \r\ndecisions of the 2005 Summit. \r\n A key task of the Commission is to eliminate a \r\nserious gap in the international system of post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. It should help to enhance the \r\ncoordination and the effectiveness of international \r\nassistance to countries emerging from crisis, in \r\nconjunction with efforts of the United Nations, \r\ninternational financial institutions and the world donor \r\ncommunity. We note in particular the Commission’s \r\nrole, in solid interaction with the Governments of the \r\ncountries receiving assistance, in identifying, \r\nprioritizing and targeting donor resources in order to \r\nresolve fundamental problems. \r\n The first annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission confirms that the Commission has much \r\npractical potential and is capable of becoming one of \r\nthe most important international mechanisms in that \r\nsphere. \r\n The Commission’s work, first on Burundi and \r\nSierra Leone, generally deserves a positive assessment. \r\nFour extremely important priority areas for \r\nstrengthening peace in each of those two countries \r\nwere defined. The process of developing an integrated \r\nstrategy of peacebuilding was begun and the \r\nparametres of the monitoring mechanisms were agreed \r\nupon. The practical work of the Commission on \r\nspecific countries should be transparent and \r\naccompanied by an impartial collective analysis and \r\nclearly defined priorities for peacebuilding. We \r\nanticipate agreed and effective recommendations from \r\nit, which will be expected by the recipient countries \r\nfirst of all. \r\n Next year, the Commission will continue its work \r\non resolving questions of strengthening the functional \r\nlinks between international financial institutions, \r\nregional organizations and the donor community. \r\nAdditional attention should be given to improving \r\ncooperation on the ground with all actors in the \r\npeacebuilding process and to harmonizing the activities \r\nof the Peacebuilding Support Office and the \r\nCommission with existing coordination mechanisms, \r\nfirst those within the United Nations system. Their \r\ninteraction with United Nations agencies, in particular \r\nin the field, should not disrupt the existing system of \r\noperational activities of the Organization but, on the \r\ncontrary should bolster it. \r\n Of particular importance is the task of \r\nstrengthening the organic link between the \r\nCommission and the Security Council, above all with \r\nregard to issues that are on the agenda of both bodies. \r\nIt is important to ensure timely exchange of \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n15 07-53720 \r\n \r\ninformation between both bodies and a clear division \r\nof labour and complementarity. Of course, that must be \r\ndone in parallel with the development of links between \r\nthe Commission and the Economic and Social Council.  \r\n In addition, we cannot but welcome the great deal \r\nof work done by the Peacebuilding Support Office, in \r\nwhich hope lies both for improving the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and for managing the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. \r\n We support focusing the activities of the Fund on \r\nassisting countries in the earliest stages of emerging \r\nfrom conflict, while the traditional mechanisms for \r\nmobilizing development assistance are not yet \r\nfunctioning. We note the Fund’s catalytic role in \r\nattracting more-permanent mechanisms of support for \r\nthe post-conflict recovery processes. In our view, that \r\nis the area where the Fund should concentrate its work \r\nfirst of all. \r\n I wish to stress the importance of improving the \r\nanalysis and evaluation of the peacebuilding \r\nrequirements of relevant countries by the United \r\nNations country teams, which, according to the scope \r\nof the Fund, can initiate decisions on giving the \r\ncountry access to Fund resources without approval by \r\nthe Commission. That places particular responsibility \r\non the Peacebuilding Support Office, which takes the \r\nfinal decision. We are in favour of clarity, transparence \r\nand openness of the criteria for giving countries such \r\naccess. It must first be given to those countries that are \r\ndangerously close to the brink of relapsing into \r\nconflict. We count on increased accountability in the \r\nfunctioning of the Fund. \r\n Not much time has passed in order to be able to \r\ndraw exhaustive conclusions on the effectiveness of the \r\nwork of the Fund. However, in the future it would \r\nmake sense to think about organizing an independent \r\nstudy of its activities. \r\n A clear manifestation of our support for the Fund \r\nis the decision by the Government of Russia to make a \r\n2 million dollar contribution to the Fund annually, \r\nstarting in 2008. We expect that those funds will truly \r\nstrengthen the Fund’s potential in the above-mentioned \r\nareas of its work. \r\n Mr. Scott (United States of America): It is an \r\nhonour to present the views of my Government on the \r\nimportant work of the Peacebuilding Commission. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is an innovation with much \r\npromise. This plenary item — a discussion of the \r\nannual reports of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund — brings to a close the first \r\nyear of activity by the Commission. In our view, this \r\nhas been a year of considerable focus on procedural \r\nissues, with progress made on building a foundation for \r\nthe Commission’s productive future work. \r\n Sadly, however, we do not believe that the \r\nmembers of the Peacebuilding Commission can look \r\nback over this past year and point to tangible \r\ncontributions to the lives of the people in Sierra Leone \r\nand Burundi — the first two countries taken up by the \r\nCommission. \r\n In its second year, we look to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to sharpen its role in promoting dialogue \r\nand coordination on critical challenges to stability in \r\nthe countries on its agenda. We expect that the \r\nCommission will do more to draw the international \r\ncommunity’s attention to the need for sustained long-\r\nterm engagement in the countries on the agenda. We \r\nlook for practical engagement on difficult thematic \r\nissues where the Commission has a role to play in \r\nbringing together stakeholders, in producing best \r\npractices and in broadening the donor base. \r\n The agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nwill likely broaden over the coming year to include \r\nadditional countries, beginning with the pending \r\nrequest of Guinea-Bissau that is currently before the \r\nSecurity Council. Members of the Security Council and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission should reflect on how \r\nthe specific considerations of candidate countries will \r\nbest mesh with the strategic vision and multi-year work \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. In doing so, we \r\nsuggest that as a fledgling institution, the Commission \r\nshould walk before it runs. Demonstrating delivery of \r\nconcrete results in the countries currently on its agenda \r\nshould have priority over expanding its work \r\nelsewhere. \r\n While working from lessons learned in its first \r\nyear, the Peacebuilding Commission should also \r\nconsider new ways of providing advice and \r\nrecommendations. We saw in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s first year, that while countries on its \r\nagenda face many of the same challenges, differing \r\nlocal circumstances dictate unique approaches. As the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission takes on new countries, it \r\nshould not limit itself to promoting a global \r\ncomprehensive peacebuilding strategies approach to \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 16 \r\n \r\ncountries under consideration, but also consider \r\ntargeted advice and recommendations on specific \r\nthematic sectors or even a geographic region. \r\n We do not see the annual reports of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund as reflecting a consensus on the above issues \r\namong members of the Peacebuilding Commission. In \r\nparticular, we invite your attention to the issue of \r\nfinancing missions of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\noutlined in paragraph 43 as an issue demanding further \r\ndiscussion. However, in our view, both reports are a \r\nuseful reference to the challenges and topics currently \r\nbefore the Peacebuilding Commission and we welcome \r\ntheir publication. \r\n In conclusion, may I add our thanks to the current \r\nand former Chairmen of the Commission for their hard \r\nwork in leading the Peacebuilding Commission as it \r\naddresses these key issues which confront the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): Let me join others in \r\nthanking you, Sir, for giving us the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in the meeting of the General Assembly \r\ndevoted to the important work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and its first annual report (A/62/137). Let \r\nme also use this opportunity to pay tribute to the \r\nformer Chairman of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nmy colleague Gaspar Martins from Angola, and the two \r\ncolleagues from Norway and the Netherlands for their \r\nsteering of the country-specific work on Burundi and \r\nSierra Leone, as well as my colleague from \r\nEl Salvador, for chairing the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned. The new Chairman, Ambassador \r\nYukio Takasu, can be assured of our full support and \r\ncooperation. \r\n From the outset, Iceland has been a strong \r\nsupporter of the Peacebuilding Commission. We regard \r\nthe Commission as a key achievement of the United \r\nNations reform process. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission together with the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice and the Peacebuilding Fund have important \r\nroles to play in bridging the gap between conflict and \r\ndevelopment and focusing on activities in the field. \r\n The Government of Iceland has contributed \r\n$1 million to the Peacebuilding Fund and is planning \r\nfurther contributions. We urge Member States to \r\ncontribute to the Fund. We are pleased to note that \r\nmore than $230 million has already been pledged or \r\ncontributed to it. \r\n After one year of operation, it is time to take \r\nstock of where we are and offer guidance for our future \r\nwork. In that context, we warmly welcome the first \r\nannual report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(A/62/137). This comprehensive and important report \r\nclearly indicates that considerable progress has been \r\nmade towards establishing the working methods of the \r\nCommission. We applaud the work of the \r\nOrganizational Committee of the Commission on \r\norganizational and procedural issues. Here I would like \r\nto mention the adoption of the provisional rules of \r\nprocedure and the concept paper setting up the \r\nframework for the development of integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission has identified \r\ncritical priority areas for peace and consolidation for \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone. The development of an \r\nintegrated peacebuilding strategy for Burundi is an \r\nimportant step in that regard. Iceland welcomes the fact \r\nthat an integrated peacebuilding strategy for Sierra \r\nLeone has been developed as well. The \r\nrecommendations of the Commission must be \r\nimplemented in the countries concerned and within the \r\ninstitutional framework of the United Nations. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission must now build upon that \r\nwork and further develop its working methods. The \r\nunderpinnings are already in place. The focus should \r\nremain on practical, effective cooperation and avoiding \r\nduplication of effort. \r\n The working relationships between the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the Security Council, the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil should be strengthened through dialogue on a \r\nregular basis. Regular meetings between the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission Chairs and the Presidents \r\nof those bodies would be one possibility. We also need \r\nto consider increased cooperation between the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and regional and \r\nsubregional organizations in order to promote \r\npeacebuilding in the countries under consideration. \r\n We are pleased that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has recognized the link between poverty, \r\nweak State capacity and conflict and has ensured that \r\nthe integrated peacebuilding strategies include job \r\ncreation, especially for youth, capacity development \r\nand the delivery of basic social services as priorities. \r\nOnly by making substantial progress in those areas can \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission help to ensure the \r\nsustainability of national peacebuilding efforts. \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n17 07-53720 \r\n \r\n Iceland remains firmly committed to the work of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. The success of that \r\nbody is absolutely dependent on the political will of \r\nthe countries concerned and the Member States. The \r\nmain challenge now facing the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is to maximize its impact on the ground. \r\nWe all have a duty to ensure that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission becomes an effective tool that can \r\ncontribute in a significant manner to the establishment \r\nof peace, stability and development in post-conflict \r\ncountries. My country is committed to doing its share.  \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): It is a great \r\nhonour for me to speak on behalf of the Vietnamese \r\ndelegation at this important meeting of the General \r\nAssembly. My delegation is convinced that our debate \r\ntoday demonstrates our sustained attention to the \r\nstrengthening of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nthe enhancement of the coordination amongst the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations for the sake of \r\nsustainable peace and development in the world. \r\n In order to develop an overall strategic and \r\ncoherent approach to the question of international \r\npeacebuilding, world leaders at the 2005 World \r\nSummit decided to establish the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, the Peacebuilding Fund and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office. The new peacebuilding \r\narchitecture is expected to serve as a dedicated \r\nmechanism to address the special needs of conflict-\r\nprone countries in various regions of our world. \r\n In that regard, Viet Nam wishes to commend the \r\nrecent efforts undertaken by the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in the light of General Assembly \r\nresolution A/60/180 and Security Council resolution \r\n1645 (2005) respectively. We note with satisfaction \r\nthat the Organizational Committee has addressed a \r\nseries of key organizational, procedural and \r\nmethodological issues in its first year of operation, \r\nincluding the finalization of the operational framework \r\nand provisional rules of procedure, the organization of \r\ncountry-specific meetings and the establishment of an \r\nad hoc working group. \r\n The Peacebuilding Fund has also made laudable \r\nefforts in mobilizing resources from the international \r\ndonor community and in examining projects eligible \r\nfor funding in post-conflict countries. We are even \r\nmore encouraged by the fact that Sierra Leone and \r\nBurundi, the first countries supported by the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, have made remarkable \r\nprogress in critical areas of national reconstruction and \r\nrehabilitation, such as the promotion of good \r\ngovernance, strengthening of the rule of law, reform of \r\njustice and the security sector, and capacity-building. \r\n While recognizing the fact that peacebuilding is \r\nnaturally a complex and long-term process which \r\nrequires persistent and long-term commitments, my \r\ndelegation shares the view expressed by various \r\ndelegations that a lot of ground remains to be covered. \r\nA daunting challenge is how the Commission can build \r\nup an engaged partnership and active participation \r\namong different stakeholders and marshal the resources \r\nnecessary for stability, recovery and development in \r\nwar-torn countries. It is therefore necessary for the \r\ninternational community to provide, in a timely \r\nmanner, adequate resources and support. My delegation \r\nfully agrees with the assessment in the report that the \r\nmain challenge facing the Commission is to maximize \r\nits impact on the ground and to make the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture an effective \r\ninstrument of international cooperation in support of \r\ncountries emerging from conflicts. \r\n The first anniversary of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has elapsed with both achievements and \r\nchallenges. If it is to live up to the expectations and \r\naspirations of the international community, \r\nimprovements should be made in some crucial areas \r\nand a number of outstanding issues must be addressed \r\nin the coming years. That should include the further \r\ndevelopment of the working methods of the \r\nCommission, the monitoring mechanisms for \r\nintegrated peacebuilding strategies, and enhanced \r\noperational relationships with other intergovernmental \r\nbodies as well as regional and subregional \r\norganizations. \r\n Enhanced interaction among various stakeholders \r\nengaged in post-conflict peacebuilding activities is of \r\nvital importance. The United Nations broad experience \r\nspanning conflict prevention, mediation, peacekeeping, \r\nhumanitarian and election assistance, reconstruction \r\nand sustainable development must be fully exploited in \r\nconjunction with inputs from international financial \r\ninstitutions, non-governmental organizations, civil \r\nsociety and the private sector. \r\n We strongly believe that integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies must fully reflect the socio-economic \r\nreconstruction and development priorities of recipient \r\ncountries, as well as the comparative advantages and \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 18 \r\n \r\npractical commitment of international donors. Such a \r\nwell-coordinated process, we believe, helps avoid \r\nwasteful duplication or misuse and, at the same time, \r\nneeds periodical review to bring about better outcomes. \r\n We wish to reiterate that the national ownership \r\nof post-conflict peacebuilding priority plans and \r\ninitiatives must remain at the forefront of any effort \r\naimed at sustaining peace, initiating development and \r\npromoting post-conflict recovery. Foreign assistance \r\nplays a supplementary role and cannot replace home-\r\ngrown endeavours for enhancing institutional \r\nframeworks, reinforcing capacity-building and \r\nstrengthening legal and administrative systems that \r\nultimately bolster autonomy and self-determination. \r\n My delegation agrees that the future work of the \r\nCommission must ensure that peacebuilding processes \r\nremain on track and that challenges are addressed in a \r\ntimely and coherent manner by all relevant actors. In \r\nthe early phase of its life, the Commission has a \r\nnumber of issues to address in order to improve its \r\neffectiveness and broaden its impact on the ground. To \r\nthat effect, the General Assembly plays the central role \r\nin conducting regular reviews of the activities of the \r\nCommission, as well as in formulating sound guidance \r\nand policies for the effective operation of the \r\nCommission. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation welcomes this opportunity to consider the \r\nreport submitted by the Peacebuilding Commission at \r\nthe end of its first session, pursuant to resolution \r\n60/180. \r\n Mexico acknowledges the work done by \r\nAmbassador Gaspar Martins of Angola, who had the \r\nsensitive task of leading the Organizational Committee \r\nat the beginning of its work. We express the hope that \r\nthe chairmanship of Ambassador Yukio Takasu of \r\nJapan will be crowned with success. \r\n My delegation also commends the dedication \r\nshown by the coordinators of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations, Ambassador Johan Løvald of Norway \r\nand Ambassador Frank Majoor of the Netherlands, as \r\nwell as by Ambassador Gallardo Hernández of \r\nEl Salvador in her work as coordinator of the working \r\ngroup on lessons learned. \r\n We congratulate Ms. Caroline McAskie, Assistant \r\nSecretary-General in the Peacebuilding Support Office, \r\non her work and commitment during this innovating \r\nphase of the new peacebuilding architecture being put \r\ntogether by our Organization. \r\n The recognition of major gaps in the United \r\nNations peacebuilding efforts in countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict, as well as the recurrence of violence in \r\nsome national situations, led our heads of State and \r\nGovernment at the 2005 World Summit to agree to \r\nestablish the Commission — one of the concrete \r\noutcomes of the United Nations reform process.  \r\n During the Commission’s first year of operations, \r\nit has become clear that the peacebuilding process must \r\nbe approached on the ground and by taking into \r\nconsideration the specificities of the various countries \r\nconcerned. No model repeats itself; every country has \r\nits own characteristics and history. Creative proposals \r\nare therefore required to build frameworks and \r\nprogrammes that harmonize with national realities. \r\nMexico therefore believes that the Commission must \r\nbe directed by the following guiding points. \r\n First, the full consent of a country and its \r\nGovernment that may be included in the Commission’s \r\nprogramme is necessary. Secondly, the process must be \r\ndefined on the basis of priorities established by each \r\nGovernment concerned. Thirdly, national, regional and \r\ninternational actors must cooperate on the basis of a \r\ncommon vision of purposes and priorities.  \r\n While we recognize that, as a recently established \r\nbody, the Commission is still being defined and its \r\nworking methods developed, we are encouraged by its \r\nOrganizational Committee’s decision to establish, in \r\nclose coordination with the Government of Burundi, an \r\nintegrated peacebuilding strategy with the support of \r\nthe United Nations and members of civil society. We \r\nare also pleased that a similar strategy is being \r\ndeveloped with the Government of Sierra Leone. \r\n We believe that the Commission should redouble \r\nits efforts to improve its approaches and working \r\nmethods during its second session, when it will also \r\nhave to address pending issues. Among those, we note \r\nthe need to establish tracking and monitoring \r\nmechanisms for integrated peacebuilding strategies in \r\ncountries under its consideration. My delegation feels \r\nthat, without such mechanisms, it will be difficult to \r\nassess the impact of the Commission’s work on the \r\nground. Another important task will be to ensure that \r\nnational Governments are able to deliver peace \r\ndividends to their peoples through economic recovery \r\nprogrammes.  \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n19 07-53720 \r\n \r\n Mexico also considers it essential that socio-\r\neconomic conditions in the post-conflict phase be \r\ngiven priority in the context of peacebuilding efforts so \r\nthat the proper balance can be struck between the \r\ndemand for reform in the judicial and security sectors \r\nand in the sphere of the rule of law on the one hand and \r\nmeeting the basic needs of the population on the other.  \r\n Moreover, in order to promote United Nations \r\nsystem-wide coherence, the Commission should \r\nstrengthen its coordinating role and its relationships \r\nwith other United Nations organs, in particular the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, as well as with regional \r\norganizations and entities outside the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n Establishing a lasting peace is a process in which \r\nthe Commission, as the coordinating body, has the \r\nchallenge of promoting a common vision among all \r\nconcerned actors, with a view to overcoming the \r\nenormous challenge of transforming a society emerging \r\nfrom painful conflict into one in which peace, security \r\nand development prevail. \r\n We welcome the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nthe operation and activities of the Peacebuilding Fund \r\n(A/62/138), which enables Member States to fulfil their \r\nmandate to provide policy guidance on the use of the \r\nFund. My delegation understands that because of the \r\nrecent implementation of the Fund — in January 2007 \r\nfor Burundi and in March 2007 for Sierra Leone — it \r\nis premature to analyse its impact on peacebuilding \r\ninitiatives in those two countries. However, we are \r\npleased with progress in both Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone, the latter being where the Fund helped support \r\nnational authorities during the successful electoral \r\nprocess in September. National ownership of a peace \r\nprocess and the Fund’s catalytic effect in encouraging \r\nthe long-term commitment of donors are the two basic \r\nprinciples defining the Fund and should continue to \r\nguide its operations.  \r\n We support the Peacebuilding Support Office, \r\nand we call for the streamlining of the Office’s \r\nprocedures, on the basis of the lessons learned in the \r\nfirst nine months of the operation of the Fund, so as to \r\nfurther optimize the use of resources and to make \r\naccess more flexible in order to address the most \r\npressing problems of peacebuilding during the early \r\nstages of the process. The Fund can take successful \r\nexperiences into account in considering future cases. \r\n Although the Fund relies on voluntary \r\ncontributions, it is important that it receive, on a \r\npredictable basis, financial resources with which to \r\ncarry out its short-term and medium-term activities. \r\nWithout adequate resources, the Commission will not \r\nbe able to completely fulfil its mandate. Mexico \r\nsupports the work of the Commission and it has \r\nrecently conveyed its decision to make a financial \r\ncontribution to the Fund. \r\n Without disregarding the challenges inherent in \r\nthese matters, Mexico is confident of the contribution \r\nthat the Commission can make to the work of the \r\nOrganization. For this reason, it is important that \r\nMember States closely follow its work and ensure its \r\ndevelopment in order to guarantee the greatest possible \r\nimpact in meeting the goals that led to its creation.  \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to thank Ambassador \r\nTakasu, Chairman of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nfor presenting to the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly the Commission’s report on its first \r\nsession (A/62/137). Our thanks go also to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his report on the operation of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund (A/62/138). We support the \r\nconclusions and recommendations contained in those \r\nreports. \r\n Two years ago, world leaders unanimously \r\ndecided to establish a United Nations peacebuilding \r\ncommission, bringing hope for peace to people trapped \r\nin conflicts. As a member of the Commission, the \r\nChinese delegation is pleased to see that, under the \r\nleadership of Ambassador Gaspar Martins of Angola, \r\nChairman of the Commission at its first session, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission achieved fruitful results in \r\nits work over the past year in the following areas. First \r\nof all, it established sound provisional rules of \r\nprocedure and guidelines to ensure the orderly and \r\nconsistent conduct of its work. Secondly, it set up \r\nflexible and diverse formats for its meetings and built \r\npartnerships with all sides on an equal footing. Finally, \r\nit encouraged ownership by the countries concerned, \r\nwinning their trust and establishing good working \r\nrelationships with them. \r\n \r\n  Mr. İlkin (Turkey), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n Of course, as a newly founded body, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission still faces a host of \r\nchallenges, including how to enhance its value-added \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 20 \r\n \r\nrole, to coordinate with other United Nations organs \r\nand to increase its efficiency. While it has full \r\nconfidence in the Peacebuilding Commission’s work in \r\nthe coming year, the Chinese delegation wishes to \r\nmake a few suggestions on ways to improve it. \r\n First, the Peacebuilding Commission should \r\nfurther define its role as an advisory body. The relevant \r\nprovisions of the relevant General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions should be scrupulously \r\nimplemented. The Peacebuilding Commission provides \r\nadvice both to the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil and to the countries concerned. Therefore, the \r\nCommission should marshal resources both within and \r\noutside the system and should make concrete \r\nrecommendations that are effective and to the point. \r\n Secondly, the Peacebuilding Commission should \r\nproperly define its relationships with other United \r\nNations organs. Within the United Nations system, it \r\nshould increase its interaction with the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. It should also make full use of the \r\nresources of United Nations funds and programmes on \r\nthe ground to prevent duplication and waste. \r\n Thirdly, the Peacebuilding Commission should \r\nstrike a balance between partnership and ownership. \r\nThe partnerships established by the international \r\ncommunity through the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nwith countries concerned enable the international \r\ncommunity to provide necessary assistance to those \r\ncountries. But a partner can be no more than a \r\nparticipating party: the destiny of the countries \r\nconcerned is in their own hands. The international \r\ncommunity should not take everything over from them. \r\n Fourthly, the Peacebuilding Commission should \r\ngive consideration to the special needs of African \r\ncountries. African hot-spot issues account for some two \r\nthirds of the items on the Security Council’s agenda, \r\nand most United Nations peacekeeping operations are \r\nin Africa. The Peacebuilding Commission should \r\ncontinue to make this one of the important factors in \r\ntaking on new countries to be included in its agenda. \r\n I would also like to mention, in particular, a \r\nmajor component of the Peacebuilding Commission: \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund. As a new financing \r\nmechanism, the Fund is of a great significance for \r\nlaunching relevant peacebuilding programmes. Its \r\noperations over the past year have demonstrated its key \r\nrole as a catalyst. While by and large satisfied with the \r\nfinancing and functioning of the Fund, the Chinese \r\ndelegation looks forward to efforts by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to ensure that the Fund is more transparent and \r\nbetter conforms to relevant standards and norms. The \r\nChinese Government will redeem its pledge to the \r\nFund on time. \r\n Nothing in the world is more precious than peace, \r\nand no approach is better than cooperation. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission embodies everyone’s \r\naspirations for peaceful reconstruction and our sincere \r\nexpectations of win-win results through cooperation. \r\nLet us join hands and contribute to a bright future for \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Ms. Pierce (United Kingdom): I would like to \r\nbegin by thanking the President of the General \r\nAssembly for organizing this important debate. It \r\noffers a very useful opportunity to take stock of the \r\nwork of the Peacebuilding Commission and of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund following their first anniversaries. \r\nIt also allows us to chart the challenges that we still \r\nface. \r\n I would like to align myself with the statement \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Portugal on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. \r\n But first, I would like to offer some tributes in \r\nrecognition of the enormous energy and time that \r\nmembers of the Peacebuilding Commission have put \r\ninto the establishment of the Commission. Its first year \r\nwas always going to be a challenge, as there had been \r\nno precedents set for its work. I would like to thank the \r\nprevious Chairmen of the Organizational Committee, \r\nAmbassadors Gaspar Martins and Oshima, and the \r\nAssistant Secretary-General for Peacebuilding Support \r\nand her team; and I would like to congratulate the new \r\nChairman, Ambassador Takasu, on his appointment. I \r\nwould also like to express my country’s thanks to the \r\nNetherlands and Norway for the achievements \r\naccomplished so far in the country-specific work in \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone and to pay tribute to the \r\nauthorities of those two countries who have joined us \r\nin many video conferences to talk about the issues that \r\nthe Commission is dealing with. Finally, I would like \r\nto thank El Salvador for taking forward the work on \r\nlessons learned and Ghana for taking on the role of \r\nVice-Chair. \r\n In the first year of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, thanks to the engagement of the \r\nGovernments of Burundi and Sierra Leone, the United \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n21 07-53720 \r\n \r\nNations teams in both countries and, of course, their \r\nPermanent Representatives, we have seen a constant \r\nreminder of the centrality of the Commission’s main \r\nfocus: its country-level work. National ownership of \r\nthe peacebuilding process is vital; so too is the need for \r\nbroad and substantive consultation among all \r\nstakeholders in shaping the peacebuilding agenda. \r\n The progress articulated in the annual reports \r\nbefore us demonstrates the achievements made. These \r\nneed to be built upon if we are to ensure that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission delivers on its ultimate \r\ngoal and its ultimate test: helping to prevent countries \r\nfrom relapsing into conflict and helping them to build a \r\nsolid foundation for peace and stability. Over the past \r\nyear, there has been much talk about how the \r\nCommission can add value. We consider that where it \r\ncan have impact lies in its two main functions: first, \r\nproviding a forum where the international community \r\ncan help address political barriers to peacebuilding; \r\nand secondly, helping bring coherence and \r\nharmonization to the international community’s efforts \r\nin the countries under consideration. \r\n Setting up the Joint Verification and Monitoring \r\nMechanism in Burundi and completing the Sierra \r\nLeone Compact in the coming months will be \r\nimportant steps in defining the commitments of all \r\nparties. I think it is important that we have two slightly \r\ndifferent mechanisms for each country, with the main \r\npoint being that they are tailored to what the country \r\non the agenda needs. Living up to the relevant \r\nresponsibilities — whether they be those of the \r\nGovernment, of political parties or of Commission \r\nmembers — will be the key test. But there is a need to \r\nensure that that does not become just a mechanical \r\nprocess. The Peacebuilding Commission needs to stay \r\nalive to the very difficult challenges faced by countries \r\nemerging from conflict. That is why my Government is \r\ngreatly encouraged by the approach used in the recent \r\nconclusions and recommendations of the Commission \r\nthat followed the report of the Chair of the country-\r\nspecific meeting on Burundi. \r\n We believe that those conclusions and \r\nrecommendations demonstrate the importance of the \r\nadvice and the relationships that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has with Governments, the Security \r\nCouncil, the General Assembly, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, the international financial institutions \r\nand other partners. Strengthening those relationships \r\nwill be essential for improving the impact of the \r\nCommission’s work and for ensuring that it is practical \r\nin its approach. \r\n I see five issues that spring from that point. First, \r\nat some point in the near future, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will need to define more clearly how it \r\nworks with its parent bodies and with the Economic \r\nand Social Council. Perhaps that will become clearer \r\nwith time as practical precedents are established. \r\n Secondly, the country-specific work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission should not remain static. It \r\nis important that further countries be referred to the \r\nCommission’s agenda this year. This should be linked \r\nto the capacities of the Commission and of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office. Both need to define \r\nwhat their limits are. \r\n Thirdly, in taking on new countries, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission needs to consider from the \r\noutset what its niche is in the country concerned. It \r\nneeds to take stock of what plans and programmes \r\nalready exist and to identify critical gaps. In addressing \r\nthese, the Commission needs to take stock of the broad \r\nrange of skills, experiences and resources of its \r\nmembers. \r\n Fourthly, it is important that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s relationship with the countries on its \r\nagenda not be an excessive burden on them. It needs to \r\nbe clear about what it expects of a country and vice \r\nversa. We see that building a solid partnership is the \r\nkey to success. \r\n Fifthly, as a number of other speakers have \r\nmentioned, the Peacebuilding Support Office needs to \r\nbuild on its work to date if it is to become the United \r\nNations hub for peacebuilding. The Office should have \r\nstrong links with all other parts of the United Nations \r\nsystem working on peacebuilding, and it should be able \r\nto signpost United Nations country teams to relevant \r\nskills and best practices. That will also further the work \r\nof the Commission in promoting and adopting best \r\npractices. \r\n As far as the Peacebuilding Fund is concerned, \r\nwe welcome the establishment of the Advisory Group, \r\nand we look forward to receiving the paper that it has \r\ncommissioned to produce strategic guidance on use of \r\nthe Fund. It will need to provide greater clarity about \r\nthe structural relationship between the Commission and \r\nthe Fund and about areas where strategically greater \r\nties can be forged. It will need to take stock of the \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 22 \r\n \r\nvarious settings in which the Fund can be employed in \r\norder to ensure that it can add the most value possible. \r\n With regard to sequencing the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and of the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, the United Kingdom believes that, where \r\ncountries on the Commission’s agenda have existing \r\ndonor mechanisms, the Commission’s strategy work \r\nneeds to come before the bulk of Fund funding. That \r\nwill enable the Commission to give strategic guidance \r\non the use of the funds. But ultimately, the Fund is \r\nlikely to have the greatest value in those countries \r\ncoming out of conflict where there are no established \r\ndonor mechanisms or where opportunities suddenly \r\narise for Peacebuilding Fund resources to provide a \r\ncatalytic role in promoting peacebuilding. In that \r\nrespect, we are encouraged by the recent use of the \r\nemergency, or third, window of the Fund for Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and the Central African Republic. \r\n Finally, the United Kingdom’s overall assessment \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding \r\nFund is, like that of many of our colleagues, broadly \r\npositive. In their second year, the Commission and the \r\nFund need to consolidate their work to date and to \r\nensure that these issues are taken up and developed. \r\nWe believe that it is incumbent upon all of us to invest \r\nour time, money and political capital to ensure that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund reduce the risk of the recurrence of conflict. The \r\nUnited Kingdom is committed to building partnerships \r\nto that end. \r\n Mr. Sen (India): Thank you, Mr. İlkin, for \r\npresiding over this meeting; I am very pleased that you \r\nare presiding over a meeting in which I am taking part. \r\nI would also like to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for scheduling today’s timely discussion on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund.  \r\n Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to \r\nJapan for the work that it has already accomplished as \r\nChair of the Peacebuilding Commission, to the \r\nPermanent Representative of Angola for his work over \r\nmost of the past year as first Chairman of the \r\nCommission, and to the Chairs of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations and the Chair of the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned.  \r\n We associate ourselves with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM). We thank \r\nMr. Raymond Wolfe for his work as NAM coordinator \r\nin the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n India is strongly committed to the objectives and \r\nwork of the Peacebuilding Commission, and has also \r\ncontributed to the resources of the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\nWe have read the report (A/62/137) of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, as well as the report \r\n(A/62/138) of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. We note the important points \r\nmade in those reports. Indeed, since we were \r\nassociated with the finalization of the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, we are well acquainted \r\nwith it. These reports will be of lasting value to the \r\ninternational community and to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission as we chart our course in the area of peace \r\nconsolidation in the year ahead. \r\n Without dwelling on these reports, which are \r\npublic documents, I must point out that much has been \r\nleft unsaid. In the case of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission that is natural, since multilaterally \r\nnegotiated reports inevitably highlight the lowest \r\ncommon denominator. Nevertheless, it encapsulates \r\nseveral of the more important achievements of the \r\ngroup, which are not inconsiderable developments and \r\nare worthy of praise. However, I would like to focus \r\nupon some elements that are not reflected, but are of \r\ncentral importance, in India’s perspective, for the \r\nfuture work of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n First, we need to collectively exert greater efforts \r\nto move beyond debating issues of process to \r\nimplementing measures. Process issues distract us from \r\nthe real purpose of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nwhich is to assist countries on the agenda with focused \r\nand topical advice through the marshalling of \r\nresources. To us, it seems evident that we can only \r\nresolve this problem by confronting it squarely, and not \r\nby bypassing it and moving on. Therefore, while it is \r\nunderstandable that some see the empowerment of the \r\ncountry-specific configurations as a means to deliver \r\nconcrete outcomes, that is not a durable solution. The \r\nsolution lies in making the Organizational Committee, \r\nwhich is the steering mechanism of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, work better. We must therefore \r\nharmonize the deliberations of both the Organizational \r\nCommittee and the country-specific configurations, \r\nand make both more result-oriented. \r\n Secondly, while providing advice is both logical \r\nand natural for a body that is defined as an advisory \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n23 07-53720 \r\n \r\nbody, there is a need to also listen to those whom we \r\nwish to assist. Sometimes the discourse in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, whether within the \r\nOrganizational Committee or the country-specific \r\nconfigurations, does not suggest that this is the case. At \r\none level, countries on the agenda of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission do need to hear the full gamut of views \r\nand suggestions made with the best of intentions by \r\neach of us. Providing good, constructive and candid \r\nadvice dispassionately is important, and therefore it is \r\ndifficult. But that is not nearly as difficult as listening \r\ncarefully to what the various actors on the ground are \r\nsaying. While their views may divert from our advice, \r\nmeaningful advice must involve a two-way dialogue, \r\nnot one-way transmission. In that connection, it would \r\nbe helpful if the countries concerned could also tell us \r\nclearly the areas in which their need for assistance is \r\nmost critical. Such inputs should form the basis of \r\nmore focused, action-oriented and practical discussions \r\nwithin the Peacebuilding Commission.  \r\n I might add, in that context, that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission could certainly do better — \r\nat least we could certainly be more creative — with \r\nregard to the form in which the Commission provides \r\nadvice. For instance it would have a better impact if \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission were to facilitate access \r\nby targeted countries to eminent specialists who have \r\nthe expertise to provide advice in key areas of \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n Thirdly, while it is important to focus upon the \r\nadvisory role of the Peacebuilding Commission, there \r\nis occasionally a tendency to neglect its role in \r\nfocusing international attention, and in particular \r\nassisting in the marshalling of resources. Important \r\nthough it may be, advice alone will not consolidate \r\npeace. The mobilization of resources is the key vehicle \r\nby which post-conflict societies can begin to address \r\ncritical issues in the area of peace consolidation. Thus \r\nfar, this aspect has received inadequate attention in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We look forward to \r\ndiscussing creative solutions by which the Commission \r\ncould be more involved with the central aspect of \r\npeace consolidation. \r\n In this context, I should like to draw attention to \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund. We welcome its \r\noperationalization and the fact that it has begun to \r\ndisburse catalytic funding to Sierra Leone and Burundi, \r\nas recommended by the Organizational Committee of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, and also to other \r\ncountries in need of emergency assistance. However, \r\nwhile the operation of the Peacebuilding Fund is \r\ncertainly within the letter of the resolution that \r\nestablished it, we are not fully convinced that it is \r\noperating fully within the spirit of that resolution. To \r\nbe candid, far more transparency is needed in the \r\noperation of the Peacebuilding Fund: much more \r\nconsultation with the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nmore prompt relaying of information to the \r\nCommission regarding the utilization of funds. This is \r\nessential not only for purposes of information, but also \r\nfor the credibility of the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\nUltimately, since the Fund is based on contributions \r\nfrom Member States, it will only detract from its \r\nsustainability if it is not more transparent and \r\nconsultative. \r\n My fourth point relates to the capacity of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and its support mechanism, \r\nthe Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO). While the \r\nPBSO has done well in assisting the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, even as recruitment for the PBSO was \r\nunder way, there is now a need for greater involvement \r\non the part of the larger United Nations system — in \r\nNew York and on the ground — in the work of the \r\nCommission. The PBSO alone cannot compensate for \r\nthe entire United Nations system. Other arms of the \r\nSecretariat, including the United Nations country team \r\nconcerned, must provide information to the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission on developments on the \r\nground in the target countries where the Commission is \r\ninvolved. That is particularly so given that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is comprised of Member \r\nStates that may not always have diplomatic \r\nrepresentation on the ground in the countries \r\nconcerned. We all know that access to good, succinct \r\nand relevant information from the ground is usually \r\npriceless. That is nowhere more the case than in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n The last, although certainly not the least, point \r\nrelates to perspective. We must keep in mind that the \r\nultimate goal of our collective efforts is to enable \r\ncountries on the agenda to develop the capacity to \r\nimplement the relevant programmes and to consolidate \r\npeace independent of our direct involvement. That is to \r\nsay, irrespective of how many actors we may wish to \r\nlisten to on the ground, the protagonist can only be \r\none, the Government of the country concerned. The \r\nprimary focus cannot but be to strengthen the capacity \r\nof a post-conflict State to govern effectively and to \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 24 \r\n \r\ngovern well. If it does so, it will be able to mobilize \r\nhuman and material resources to achieve development. \r\nIt is development that is the most enduring guarantee \r\nof any long-term peace-consolidation strategy. Only \r\nthen will we have truly succeeded in our efforts. \r\n I would like to conclude by once again \r\nunderlining India’s commitment to the fullest \r\nparticipation in the Peacebuilding Commission and in \r\ncontinuing to work to make that body not only \r\neffective but, above all, relevant to the challenges for \r\nwhich it was created. \r\n Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the President for having \r\norganized today’s especially timely debate. \r\n First of all, I should like to say that France fully \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered earlier by \r\nthe representative of Portugal on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. I shall therefore limit myself to a few \r\nbrief comments.  \r\n The stakes in the success of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission are considerable, and are commensurate \r\nwith the challenges posed by post-conflict \r\nstabilization. Member States gathered at the highest \r\nlevel in this Hall to collectively set a very ambitious \r\ngoal for the Commission — one well beyond the \r\nestablishment of a new bureaucratic body. I believe \r\nthat it is important to keep that fact in mind and ensure \r\nthat we together honour the commitments that were \r\nmade. France believes that to be the purpose of this \r\ndebate.  \r\n Following its first year of functioning, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission must now begin full \r\noperations. Much has already been accomplished in \r\nthat regard. My delegation would like to pay tribute to \r\nMr. Gaspar Martins, Permanent Representative of \r\nAngola and the Commission’s previous Chairperson. \r\nWe have now established a process for bringing \r\ntogether all the actors in a given situation and putting \r\nin place a strategy to pool their efforts. In that \r\nconnection, I should like to refer to the work done to \r\nproduce the Strategic Framework for consolidating \r\npeace in Burundi, which focuses on a number of \r\nlimited priorities and commitments tailored to the \r\ncrucial stakes involved at the current stage of \r\npeacebuilding in that country. This document was \r\nprepared in close cooperation with the Government of \r\nBurundi and, equally important, with political parties, \r\ncivil society and, more generally, with all other \r\nstakeholders on the ground.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission must now move \r\nto an operational phase and guide the implementation \r\nof the Strategic Framework. In conjunction with locally \r\nestablished mechanisms, that will entail providing \r\nsupport for the necessary efforts and initiatives and \r\nfollowing up progress by ensuring that deadlines are \r\nmet. France hopes that similar efforts will soon be \r\nundertaken with regard to Sierra Leone. In that \r\nconnection, we look forward to the return of \r\nAmbassador Majoor from his visit to Freetown, where \r\na new, democratically elected Government has just \r\nbegun its work.  \r\n The issue of inscribing new countries on the \r\nagenda of the Peacebuilding Commission has now \r\narisen. In accordance with its role in that regard, the \r\nSecurity Council is currently seized of the matter. \r\nFrance believes that this issue is inextricably linked to \r\nthe ability of the Peacebuilding Commission to address \r\nthe situations on its agenda and produce tangible \r\nresults for those countries. With that aim in mind, we \r\nare debating the issue openly and imaginatively.  \r\n The need to produce results should also guide the \r\nCommission’s working methods. To be more efficient, \r\nthe Commission should take full advantage of new \r\ninformation and communications technologies, as it \r\nhas begun to do through its frequent use of \r\nvideoconferencing. France would like to thank the \r\nSecretariat for its support in that regard, and to \r\nencourage it to continue. In that connection, the \r\nupcoming consideration of the Commission’s Internet \r\nwebsite will be an opportunity to think about \r\nestablishing a genuine platform for discussion among \r\nall stakeholders.  \r\n Along with the Peacebuilding Support Office, the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, which is intended to play a \r\ncatalytic role, is an important tool in ensuring that the \r\nCommission is able to concentrate on pressing \r\npriorities, the filling of gaps and producing concrete \r\nresults. France believes it essential that the operations \r\nof the Peacebuilding Fund be fully in line with the \r\nwork of the Commission in its various configurations \r\nvis-à-vis the countries on its agenda and also its work \r\nin other areas. Given that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is a new tool, the Commission must fully \r\nadhere to the need for coherence and integration in the \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n25 07-53720 \r\n \r\nefforts of the entire international community, which \r\ncalled for the establishment of the Commission. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nreiterate the need to remain true to the prevailing spirit \r\nat the time of the Commission’s establishment, a body \r\nwhose basic goal is to bring actors together in the post-\r\nconflict process so as to ensure better synergy of \r\nefforts, fill gaps where necessary, avoid duplication \r\nand promote the international community’s efforts in a \r\ngiven situation. That requires in particular the close \r\ninvolvement of those who are able to provide expertise \r\nand resources. That is especially the case with \r\ninternational financial institutions, which are in fact \r\nactors and should play their full role in that process. It \r\nalso requires the long-term active involvement of the \r\ncountries concerned in a spirit of national ownership. \r\nCountries must also have a clear understanding of what \r\nthe Commission is and is not. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission must remain focused on each situation \r\nand its peacebuilding priorities. Nothing would affect \r\nthe success of the Commission more than dispersed \r\neffort. \r\n Lastly, I would like to say that my delegation has \r\nfull trust in Japan’s new chairmanship of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We are certain that it will \r\ntake into account all the elements I have just referred \r\nto. More generally, we are confident that it will ensure \r\nthe strengthening of the Commission and the \r\nachievement of tangible results, which is of course our \r\ncommon goal. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): Let me first express \r\nour gratitude to the President for convening this \r\nimportant joint debate on the report (A/62/137) of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/62/138). We are thankful to the \r\nSecretary-General for the presentation of his report on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund. We are also thankful to the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission for its first annual report. \r\n Indonesia associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement caucus in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n The rationales for establishing the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Peacebuilding Fund were to \r\nsupport fragile societies recovering from the \r\ndevastation of war, prevent a relapse into conflict and \r\naddress gaps in post-conflict peacebuilding efforts. \r\n Having been entrusted with the responsibility of \r\nbeing a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, we \r\nare particularly pleased to see the Commission and \r\nPeacebuilding Fund come of age during their first year \r\nof operation. Having been involved in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission during its first year, we \r\nwould like to offer some remarks that we hope will \r\ncontribute to making the international peacebuilding \r\narchitecture more robust. \r\n First, our deliberations in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission have rightly emphasized the importance \r\nof addressing good governance, the rule of law, \r\nsecurity sector reform, the fight against corruption, and \r\nhuman rights for all, which are the necessary \r\ningredients for the establishment of a pluralistic and \r\ntolerant society. While those issues are of relevance in \r\ncrafting a sound peace consolidation strategy, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission should provide equal \r\nattention to the issue of development. There is \r\noverwhelming evidence that lasting peace cannot be \r\nachieved in the absence of economic development and \r\nan improvement in the capacities of the State. \r\n It is not a coincidence that 9 out of 10 countries \r\nthat have experienced conflict at one point or other \r\nsince 1990 are impoverished and have the lowest \r\nhuman development indicators. Even when there has \r\nbeen a formal peace agreement, the vicious cycle of \r\npoverty and instability has heightened the risk of \r\nrelapse into violence. In his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization, the Secretary-General states that “there \r\ncan be no development without peace and no peace \r\nwithout development, always in the spirit of respect for \r\nhuman rights and the fundamental freedoms of \r\nhumankind” (A/62/1, para. 42). \r\n This conviction should be implemented in a \r\nconcrete manner in our deliberations to draw up \r\npeacebuilding strategies for countries on the agenda of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Secondly, it is very well understood by all \r\nMembers of the United Nations that national ownership \r\nis a fundamental principle in peacebuilding processes. \r\nThe Peacebuilding Commission needs to maintain this \r\nas its core principle, and practise it. It should be \r\nwilling to listen attentively and to pay heed to the \r\nnational Governments concerned. We also need to go \r\nthe extra mile to listen more carefully to what people in \r\nthe field genuinely need. There should be listening \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 26 \r\n \r\nwith an open mind, without superfluous preconceptions \r\nas to what may be needed in the countries concerned. \r\n We agree that the voices of civil society and other \r\nrelevant stakeholders in the field are essential to \r\nenhance national ownership. Such a perspective is \r\nconsistent with the fact that, as a matter of principle, \r\nthe voice of a democratically elected Government is \r\nthe prime source for the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\nconsideration, as it is only an elected Government that \r\ncan be held accountable by the people through the \r\nvote. Partnership and synergy between Governments \r\nand civil society is key. \r\n Thirdly, the integrated peacebuilding strategies \r\n(IPS) proposed by the Commission will only contribute \r\nto laying the foundations for sustainable recovery and \r\nthe consolidation of peace if they are truly \r\ncomprehensive and fully supported by the international \r\ncommunity, including with the full involvement and \r\nsupport of the Bretton Woods institutions and the other \r\nrelevant actors. \r\n Fourthly, the integrated peacebuilding strategies \r\nlaid out by the Peacebuilding Commission are only \r\nstrategies and promises. Their progress will need to be \r\nmonitored. The report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission states that a monitoring mechanism in that \r\nregard will be developed. We would underline the fact \r\nthat such a mechanism, as necessary as it is, should not \r\nbe too complicated and place an unnecessary burden on \r\nGovernments, which face severe capacity constraints. \r\nIt must also be evident that the responsibilities of all \r\nsides in any monitoring tool are balanced and in \r\nkeeping with the essence of the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Fifthly, as has also been very aptly stated in the \r\nconclusion of the report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, the biggest challenge is how to \r\nimplement peacebuilding strategies in the field in a \r\nconcrete manner. Fine-tuning efforts by the \r\npeacebuilding system in New York should have an \r\nimpact on the ground that is felt directly by the local \r\ncommunity. Maximum effect will be achieved if the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission focuses on being practical \r\nand results-oriented. \r\n Moreover, in order to have an impact on the \r\ncountries concerned, the Commission needs to \r\nintensify its efforts at bringing together all relevant \r\nactors to marshal resources. Apart from taking this into \r\naccount in its country configurations, the \r\nOrganizational Committee of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission can explore that issue as a specific \r\nsubject. In that context, the Committee may wish to \r\nexplore engagement with non-traditional partners and \r\nthe corporate sector, which has experienced the rise of \r\nnumerous organizations interested in having a double \r\nbottom line — on profit and social-welfare \r\ninvestments. \r\n Recommendations for coordination by the \r\nCommission are another crucial aspect that will \r\nenhance cooperation and coherence in the field of \r\ninternational post-conflict issues, thereby enhancing \r\nsynergies on the ground.  \r\n There is also a need to perhaps consider \r\ndeveloping, with the assistance of the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office, a template communications strategy \r\nthat can be utilized with case-specific adjustments in \r\ndifferent scenarios.  \r\n The ability of the Peacebuilding Commission to \r\ngarner international attention long after conflict stories \r\nslip from media headlines is intrinsic to its capacity for \r\nadvocacy and resource mobilization. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to share with the \r\nGeneral Assembly a few thoughts on how Indonesia \r\nviews the important role of the Assembly in ensuring \r\nthat the peacebuilding machinery of the United Nations \r\nfunctions well to generate maximum output in the \r\nfield. \r\n The General Assembly needs to enhance its \r\ninteraction with the Peacebuilding Commission. The \r\nAssembly could provide recommendations to the \r\nCommission in leading efforts to consolidate peace. \r\nThe General Assembly has a role in, and the mandate \r\nfor, the overall policy guidelines in peacebuilding-\r\nrelated matters, as the Assembly has the unique \r\ncapacity to address the issues of security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Economic and Social Council can also play \r\nan important role, with its capacity for advocacy and \r\nthe technical capabilities of its various commissions \r\nand subsidiary bodies. There must be regular \r\ninteraction between the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, where the relevant \r\nlessons learned and best practices can be shared. \r\n Another contribution that the General Assembly \r\ncould make would be to assist the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in carrying out its mandate to marshal \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n27 07-53720 \r\n \r\nresources. Among other things, the General Assembly \r\ncould encourage Member States to contribute to the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. The role of the Fund is critical in \r\nproviding quick and concrete peace dividends. At the \r\nsame time, the General Assembly can monitor how \r\nresources from the Peacebuilding Fund are being used. \r\nThere is also a need to speed up the process of making \r\ndisbursements from the Fund, to see to it that projects \r\nare well coordinated with other mechanisms inside and \r\noutside the United Nations and to ensure that \r\nduplication is minimized. \r\n Before I conclude, allow me to reiterate \r\nIndonesia’s commitment to the cause of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. We will continue to engage with others towards \r\nour aim of ensuring that both bodies produce tangible \r\nresults. \r\n The Acting President: I wish the representative \r\nof Indonesia continued success in his new and \r\nimportant assignment. \r\n Mr. Cho Hyun (Republic of Korea): My \r\ndelegation would first like to join others in thanking \r\nthe members of the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nSecretary-General for their tireless efforts to put the \r\nCommission on a sound footing in its first year. We \r\nalso appreciate the excellent work done by Ambassador \r\nIsmael Gaspar Martins of Angola, the first Chairperson \r\nof the Commission. Let me also convey my \r\ncongratulations to Ambassador Takasu of Japan on his \r\nnomination as the Commission’s next Chairperson. \r\n My delegation notes with satisfaction that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is already playing a \r\nproactive role in the promotion of international peace \r\nand security, despite the fact that it was launched less \r\nthan a year ago. Burundi and Sierra Leone, which were \r\nreferred to the Commission for its consideration, are \r\ncases in point. We are pleased that the Commission has \r\nbeen cooperating closely with those two countries to \r\ndraw up comprehensive plans to consolidate peace and \r\nreduce their risk of relapsing into conflict. \r\n These early outcomes demonstrate the potential \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. Nevertheless, there \r\nare still procedural details to be ironed out. We hope \r\nthat this process will be completed soon, thereby \r\nallowing the Peacebuilding Commission to focus its \r\nattention more fully on its substantive work. \r\n Peacebuilding is a long-term and very costly \r\nprocess. It requires a holistic and synergistic approach, \r\nincluding through the coordination of the \r\npeacebuilding work of the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council \r\nand such other actors as international financial \r\ninstitutions. My delegation therefore welcomes the \r\nserious efforts that the Peacebuilding Commission has \r\nmade to bring together those various actors, as well as \r\ncivil society and regional organizations. We encourage \r\nthe Commission to continue such efforts. \r\n Member States should support the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, in order to give the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nthe financial resources necessary to carry out its work. \r\nIn this regard, my delegation is pleased to note from \r\nthe report (A/62/138) of the Secretary-General that, as \r\nof July 2007, the Peacebuilding Fund had received \r\npledges and contributions exceeding 90 per cent of the \r\n$250 million funding target. The Republic of Korea has \r\ncontributed $3 million. We hope that, as the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission continues to demonstrate \r\nits value, Member States will respond by contributing \r\ngreater resources to the Fund. \r\n In peacebuilding efforts, time is of the essence. \r\nMy delegation is concerned that, at present, several \r\nmonths transpire between the announcement of an \r\nallocation to a country and the first disbursement. As \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund was conceived as a way to \r\nrespond rapidly to immediate peacebuilding needs, \r\nserious efforts should be made to significantly shorten \r\nthe delay. \r\n In terms of the Peacebuilding Commission’s work \r\nin post-conflict societies, my delegation recognizes the \r\nconcerns of many Member States with regard to \r\nnational ownership. We believe that sustainable peace \r\ncan only be built with the active participation of the \r\nnational authorities of the countries involved. Peace \r\nand security within each State are most appropriately \r\nand effectively maintained by a fully functioning \r\nnational Government. Peacebuilding efforts should \r\ntherefore serve to strengthen, not weaken, national \r\nGovernments. \r\n The reality, however, is that peacebuilding efforts \r\nare most often needed in situations where national \r\nGovernments have been severely undermined, or where \r\ntheir very legitimacy has been brought into question. \r\nEven in extreme cases where there is no competent \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 28 \r\n \r\nnational authority, the international community still has \r\na responsibility to support post-conflict peacebuilding. \r\n The Republic of Korea is a strong supporter of \r\ninternational peacebuilding efforts. Indeed, our own \r\nhistory of recovery from conflict helps us to recognize \r\nthe tremendous value of international engagement. \r\nThat is why we supported the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. We have also participated in United Nations \r\nactivities in Timor-Leste and other post-conflict \r\nsituations. Our commitment to the peacebuilding work \r\nof the United Nations remains firm. We look forward to \r\nseeing the Peacebuilding Commission take on an \r\nincreasingly proactive role, thereby contributing \r\nsignificantly to United Nations efforts to ensure peace, \r\nstability, development, the rule of law and the \r\nprotection of human rights. \r\n The Acting President: I wish the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the Republic of Korea continued \r\nsuccess in his new and important assignment. \r\n Mr. Løvald (Norway): The establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission was a concrete expression \r\nof the international community’s commitment to \r\nimprove and expand its efforts in the area of \r\npeacebuilding. The achievements of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission have already been substantial, despite the \r\nbrief period of its existence. I shall limit my remarks to \r\nhighlighting a few of the issues that my delegation \r\nbelieves we must pay attention to in the time to come. \r\nThe full text of my statement will be circulated in the \r\nHall.  \r\n Relevance on the ground must be our first \r\npeacebuilding requirement. As Jan Eliasson, one of the \r\nPresident’s predecessors, said at the inaugural meeting \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission, it is in the country-\r\nspecific settings that the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will ultimately be judged.  \r\n To make a difference on the ground, it is essential \r\nto rally all those who can make a difference in our \r\nwork. That includes Member States of the United \r\nNations, institutional donors and non-State actors. \r\nCivil society, media, the private sector and other \r\nstakeholders play an important part in consolidating \r\npeace in any given country. We need to find ways to \r\nfurther include these actors in our work. It is my strong \r\nhope that, in its second year, the Commission will \r\nspend more time on outreach activities, so that the \r\npeacebuilding agenda will have even broader \r\nownership when we take stock of where we are one \r\nyear from now. \r\n A well-functioning peacebuilding architecture is \r\nour second peacebuilding requirement. Let me, through \r\nthe President, take this opportunity to commend \r\nAssistant Secretary-General McAskie and the other \r\nmembers of Peacebuilding Support Office for their \r\nwork in support of the Commission and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. The role of the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office as a focal point and coordinator for \r\npeacebuilding within the United Nations system at the \r\nstrategic level is an important element in the \r\npeacebuilding architecture. We encourage the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office, working in cooperation \r\nwith other parts of the United Nations system, to \r\ncontinue to clarify the role of the Office in this regard. \r\nIt is also imperative that the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice be fully funded from the regular budget. \r\n It goes without saying that the new peacebuilding \r\narchitecture must not duplicate what already exists. \r\nUnited Nations funds, programmes and specialized \r\nagencies have, and will continue to have, well-defined \r\nresponsibilities. We value their contributions and call \r\nfor their continued support. \r\n Norway welcomes the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/62/138) on the Peacebuilding Fund. The Fund will \r\nnot live up to its expectations unless it has a distinct \r\ncatalytic role in terms of short-term gap-filling and \r\nlonger-term resource mobilization. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Secretary-General, along with the \r\ncountries concerned, must consider how this aspect can \r\nbe better addressed. \r\n Continued attention to needs in Burundi and \r\nSierra Leone, while opening the door for others, is the \r\nthird requirement. It is our view that peacebuilding in \r\nSierra Leone and Burundi is now more of a priority — \r\nnationally as well as internationally — than it was one \r\nyear ago. Our attention on these two counties must \r\nremain strong and focused in the year to come. \r\nSimultaneously, the Peacebuilding Commission must \r\nopen the door to other countries. However, we will \r\nhave to realize that not too many countries can be on \r\nthe agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission at a given \r\ntime. Moreover, the involvement of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission can be in parallel to a peacekeeping \r\noperation: it is not an issue of either-or but, instead, of \r\ncomplementarity. This is something for the Security \r\nCouncil to take into account. \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n29 07-53720 \r\n \r\n National ownership is the fourth requirement. In \r\nthis connection, I want to refer to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s involvement with Burundi. I am \r\nhumbled and honoured to have been the  \r\nVice-Chairperson of the Commission in its first year. I \r\nwould like to thank the members of the Commission \r\nfor entrusting me with the chairmanship of the \r\nCommission’s work on Burundi for yet another year.  \r\n It was a pleasure to work with the Government of \r\nBurundi during that time. It was particularly \r\nimpressive that the Government worked so closely and \r\neffectively with the Commission to conclude the \r\nStrategic Framework for Peacebuilding in Burundi in \r\nJune of this year. I would also like to express my \r\ngratitude to Youssef Mahmoud, Executive \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, and his team \r\nin the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi. We \r\nwere equally pleased with the consultative process in \r\nBurundi during the development of the Strategic \r\nFramework, as well as with the active participation of a \r\nvariety of stakeholders.  \r\n We must never forget that Burundians have \r\nownership over the consolidation of peace in their \r\ncountry. The Peacebuilding Commission is an advisory \r\nbody. Its job is to provide support and advice, never to \r\ntake over national efforts. \r\n Flexibility in working methods is the last \r\nrequirement for achieving success in peacebuilding. \r\nPeacebuilding is a multifaceted undertaking and \r\ntherefore has an impact on how we conduct our work. \r\nThe Peacebuilding Commission has set a new standard \r\nin the areas of international partnership and honest \r\ndialogue. This would not have been possible without \r\nclose cooperation with the Governments and United \r\nNations missions in the countries on the Commission’s \r\nagenda, or without the collective determination of all \r\nmembers of the Commission to contribute to the \r\nconsolidation of peace. It is not only a matter of doing \r\nthings better; it is also about doing things differently. \r\nPeacebuilding is a challenge to the traditional \r\nintergovernmental way of doing business. Our \r\nchallenges on the ground are concrete. As we have \r\nalready done, we must value flexibility and pragmatism \r\nin our approach to peacebuilding. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission offers us new \r\nopportunities to support peace and a better future for \r\npeople in post-conflict countries. Momentum has now \r\nbeen created, to which we must all contribute if we \r\nwish to maintain it. \r\n Mr. Hoscheit (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nThis debate, which we welcome, is the first \r\nopportunity since the debates held at the beginning of \r\nFebruary in the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil to assess the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission since its establishment and the beginning \r\nof its functioning.  \r\n Luxembourg fully associates itself with the \r\nstatement made this morning by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Portugal on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. We would like to make a few additional \r\ncomments in our capacity as a member of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n As Luxembourg’s Minister for Cooperation and \r\nHumanitarian Action said before the General Assembly \r\nin February (see A/61/PV.86), the real struggle for \r\npeace begins when the fighting is over. In saying that, \r\nthe Minister drew attention to the complex and \r\nmultidimensional nature of the peacebuilding process, \r\nwhose scope goes far beyond just the end of \r\nconfrontation. \r\n Breaking the cycle of violence by addressing the \r\nunderlying causes of conflict in the long term and \r\ninvolving the principal national and international actors \r\nwas the noble ambition that led the heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the entire world, in September 2005, to \r\ndecide to establish a new body: the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. Our debate today is an opportunity to \r\ndetermine how much ground has been covered since \r\nthen and to chart the next phase of the development of \r\nthe ground-breaking Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n As set out in the two reports before us today \r\n(A/62/137 and A/62/138), 2006 was essentially devoted \r\nto the establishment and initial functioning of the \r\nCommission, the Peacebuilding Fund and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office — the latter headed with \r\nskill and dedication by Assistant Secretary-General \r\nCarolyn McAskie. That work was essential, however \r\ntedious it might have seemed at times, for there was a \r\nneed to devise original structures and ways of doing \r\nthings that were in line with both the innovative nature \r\nof the mandate entrusted to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the demands for efficiency and speed \r\nthat accompanied the birth of that new body. A genuine \r\npeacebuilding architecture has thereby gradually been \r\nestablished. That eloquently attests to the capacity for \r\nA/62/PV.23  \r\n \r\n07-53720 30 \r\n \r\ninnovation and modernization that the United Nations \r\ncan demonstrate when it is inspired by strong and \r\nunanimous political determination on the part of \r\nMember States. \r\n Since its inception, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has developed a relationship of dialogue \r\nand openness with all international and governmental \r\nactors and representatives of civil society, working \r\ntogether in a synergistic way to make it possible for the \r\nCommission to play its role fully and fulfil its new and \r\ncomplex mandate. The Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Support Office have thereby found \r\ntheir place in the United Nations system, with \r\npeacebuilding issues being increasingly taken into \r\naccount by the Security Council, the General Assembly \r\nand the Economic and Social Council and in the \r\noperational activities of funds and programmes. That \r\ndevelopment must be consolidated and strengthened, \r\nas, here too, the concept of United Nations  \r\nsystem-wide coherence should not be a dead letter.  \r\n In that context, I would also like to welcome the \r\nabsolutely crucial contribution of representatives from \r\ncivil society and, in particular, non-governmental \r\norganizations, whose efforts are essential in defining, \r\nimplementing and following up peacebuilding \r\nstrategies. \r\n Lastly, we cannot fail to emphasize the crucial \r\nrole that can, and must, be played by international \r\nfinancial organizations and regional organizations. I \r\nam confident that appropriate arrangements will soon \r\nbe identified to allow the European Union to find its \r\nproper place in the Commission’s work as a major \r\ninternational actor deeply involved in the management \r\nof conflict and post-conflict situations throughout the \r\nworld. \r\n The establishment of a real peacebuilding \r\narchitecture — which, as needed, will have to be \r\nfurther developed and adapted according to operational \r\nneeds — is only meaningful in terms of the concrete \r\nimplementation of its mandate vis-à-vis very specific \r\npost-crisis situations. That is why there is a need to \r\nquickly begin interaction with the first two countries \r\non the Commission’s agenda: Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone. \r\n Together, we have made remarkable progress. By \r\nformulating integrated peacebuilding strategies with \r\nthose countries, we now have a much more precise and \r\nfocused understanding of the numerous complex stakes \r\ninvolved in peacebuilding, as well as of the significant \r\nchallenges facing actors involved in peacebuilding \r\nefforts on a daily basis. By adopting a pragmatic \r\nempirical approach that included respect and was based \r\non the principles of national ownership and \r\npartnership, in its country-specific configurations the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has made progress in \r\ncarrying out a dialogue with governmental authorities \r\nof the countries concerned and other interlocutors on \r\nthe adoption of integrated strategies. In what amounts \r\nto a contract of trust between the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the two countries, each partner must \r\nnow fully assume its responsibilities and meet its \r\ncommitments for as long as necessary to prevent the \r\nrecurrence of any sort of violent confrontation. \r\n In order to support and strengthen the process as \r\nit moves ahead, we must put in place follow-up and \r\nmonitoring mechanisms that are both flexible and \r\neffective. They should be based on a limited number of \r\nquantitative and qualitative indicators making it \r\npossible to evaluate the progress made towards \r\npeacebuilding and, if necessary, to identify at an early \r\nstage potential negative developments that could \r\njeopardize such progress. \r\n The joint use of the means at the disposal of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the Peacebuilding Fund \r\nand, if necessary, the international community, should \r\nmake it possible to identify and remedy possible gaps. \r\nIn that connection, we should more precisely define the \r\nrespective roles of the Commission and the Fund in \r\norder to better sequence their respective efforts.  \r\n Although the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\ncommitment to Burundi and Sierra Leone should \r\ncontinue as long as necessary, it seems to me that the \r\ntime has come to expand the Commission’s work to \r\ninclude other States. I am certain that, with the active \r\nsupport of the Peacebuilding Support Office,  \r\nthe Commission — given its unique integrated \r\ncharacter — now has available to it the experience and \r\ntools necessary to take up other cases. Of course, we \r\nmust also provide the Peacebuilding Support Office \r\nwith adequate resources to carry out its various tasks \r\nunder favourable conditions.  \r\n Although the question of managing conflict and \r\npost-conflict situations has been a traditional part of \r\nour foreign policy — both in our national capacity and \r\nas part of the European Union — Luxembourg has \r\nnevertheless been proud to be associated with this \r\n A/62/PV.23\r\n \r\n31 07-53720 \r\n \r\ngenuine adventure in peacebuilding since the beginning \r\nof this year. It is therefore with conviction and \r\nenthusiasm that my country has been involved in the \r\nvarious efforts of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nhas made contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\nLuxembourg also announced a contribution of \r\n€1 million at the development partners’ round table \r\nheld at Bujumbura at the end of May 2007. \r\n Experience in the course of the first year of the \r\nfunctioning of the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund reinforces our belief that the \r\npeacebuilding efforts of the United Nations, including \r\nthe Commission’s integrated and multidimensional \r\napproach, address a genuine need and provide an \r\nappropriate, tailored and innovative response to the \r\nnumerous challenges posed by peacebuilding. \r\n Much more remains to be done, both in New York \r\nand in the field. I wish Ambassador Takasu, the new \r\nChairperson of the Commission, every success. He \r\nreferred today to some of the issues that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission will have to address in the \r\ncoming months. I firmly believe that by adopting a \r\npragmatic approach focused on producing concrete \r\nresults, marshalling positive inputs from various \r\nsources and avoiding traditional United Nations \r\nbureaucratic tangles and bad habits, much can be \r\nachieved. That is Luxembourg’s confident hope as we \r\nbegin the second year of existence of the Commission \r\nand the Fund. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
