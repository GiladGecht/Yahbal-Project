(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Ileka \r\n (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Vice-\r\n President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 10 and 110 (continued) \r\nReport of the Peacebuilding Commission (A/62/137) \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/62/138) \r\n Mr. Chávez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru has \r\nfollowed with great interest the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the Peacebuilding Fund \r\nand the Peacebuilding Support Office. These bodies \r\nmake up a new structure within the United Nations. \r\n Like other members of the international \r\ncommunity, Peru attaches great importance to the \r\neffective work of the new intergovernmental advisory \r\nbody, namely the Peacebuilding Commission. We \r\nwould like thus to congratulate Ambassador Ismael \r\nGaspar Martins of Angola for spearheading the initial \r\nwork of the Organizational Committee and of the \r\nCommission as a whole during the launch phase. He \r\nhas shown great tact and care in achieving that. We \r\nwish the fullest success to the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Japan as Chair of the Commission \r\nduring his term. \r\n The Commission fills a vacuum within the \r\nOrganization, allowing countries that have experienced \r\nsituations of conflict to build a period of stability and \r\nsustainable peace. The Peacebuilding Commission is \r\nmuch more than just a coordination body. Its real \r\nimportance lies in its objective of adopting integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies that coordinate the efforts of \r\nnational, regional and international actors. These \r\nintegrated strategies should be monitored on the \r\nground using quantitative and qualitative indicators, \r\nwith active participation, since they are primarily \r\nresponsible for these activities, of the authorities and \r\nsociety of the country included on the agenda. Thus, as \r\nthe Commission has seen during its first year of work, \r\nappreciation of the priorities of the beneficiary country \r\nitself is of major importance. \r\n The absence of a culture of peace, the prevalence \r\nof violence and arbitrariness in the exercise of power, \r\nexclusion of the most vulnerable and of minorities and, \r\nin general, the tendency to be motivated only by the \r\ninstinct for survival are characteristics that become \r\npermanent and structural in the context of prolonged \r\nconflict. To counter that situation, it is necessary to \r\nrebuild the social fabric and generate new democratic \r\nvalues of tolerance and participation, reaffirming in the \r\nminds of the people the notion that security and quality \r\nof life can be truly rooted only in peace. \r\n The various spheres of peacebuilding make up an \r\ninterrelated, multidimensional whole that must be dealt \r\nwith care in each individual case. Disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration, national \r\nreconciliation, reform of the justice and security \r\nsectors, improvement of public management and \r\nproper use of natural resources, inter alia, must be \r\ntackled as soon as the phase of overcoming violence \r\nhas been achieved, even while peacekeeping operations \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 2 \r\n \r\nare in place and when an appropriate level of \r\nstabilization has been reached. \r\n After having moved forward in the area of \r\nregulations, procedures and methodologies of \r\npeacebuilding with reference to countries on its agenda \r\nand having taken important steps towards the adoption \r\nof provisional guidelines for the participation of civil \r\nsociety, the Commission must constantly strive to \r\nimprove coordination within the United Nations and \r\nother bodies within the system, as befits a constructive \r\nand cooperative relationship. Indeed, the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council have, \r\nwithin their mandates, specific roles in terms of \r\npeacebuilding. The very valid example of this constant \r\nlink has been the case of Burundi, where the Security \r\nCouncil has received recommendations and early \r\nwarning of a very specific nature. We feel that it is \r\nnecessary to continue to work along these lines. \r\n The delegation of Peru is following with interest \r\nthe cases of Sierra Leone and Burundi, which are \r\ncurrently on the Commission’s agenda. We sincerely \r\nhope that these endeavours will be successful, because \r\nthis is a very important objective that will serve as a \r\nvaluable precedent when considering the incorporation \r\nof other countries. In this regard, we welcome the \r\nendeavours of the representatives of the Netherlands \r\nand Norway, chairmen of the respective country-\r\nspecific configurations for Sierra Leone and Burundi, \r\nand also the commitment of the Governments of \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone to peacebuilding in their \r\nrespective countries. \r\n A key task of the Commission is to identify the \r\ncritical problems relating to peacebuilding, which are \r\nlinked, in a general manner, to the deep-rooted causes \r\nof respective conflicts. Failure to address these \r\nproblems could lead to a resurgence of violence and to \r\ndisintegration. As a result of its first months of work \r\nand the valuable information emanating from missions \r\nin the field, the Commission drew up a strategic \r\nframework for Burundi. Advances in identifying \r\ncritical areas with a view to drafting an integrated \r\nstrategy are also important in the case of Sierra Leone, \r\nwhich has just successfully held its presidential and \r\nparliamentary elections. Next comes the period of \r\nshaping the final integrated peacebuilding strategy and, \r\nwhat is perhaps more difficult, the strengthening of the \r\nCommission’s impact on the ground. That is essential \r\nand requires not only long-term action, but also short-\r\nterm projects with a tangible, rapid effect that will \r\ngenerate confidence in the population. \r\n The endeavours of the Commission call for the \r\nsupport of actors outside the United Nations. Here we \r\nshould draw attention to the active participation of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the \r\nEuropean Union and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. It is also important to persuade private \r\nenterprise, both national and transnational, of the need \r\nto participate in international endeavours to rebuild \r\ncountries, enhancing the potential that the \r\nreconstruction process signifies for them. \r\n Peru also welcomes the initiatives intended to \r\npromote and appropriately disseminate the work of the \r\nCommission, promoting greater participation of civil \r\nsociety organizations and greater impact of their work \r\non the ground. \r\n There can be no lasting peace, if it does not go \r\nhand in hand, from an early stage, with democracy, \r\nsocial inclusion, soundness of institutions and a \r\nsustainable economy. Security, development and \r\nhuman rights are closely interlinked. In short, this is \r\nthe spirit with which my country works in its \r\ncommitment to strengthening through constructive \r\ninitiatives the new peacebuilding architecture of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n In this belief, Peru, committed unfailingly to \r\nstrengthening multilateralism and peacekeeping, is a \r\ncandidate to become a member of the Organizational \r\nCommittee of the Peacebuilding Commission for the \r\nperiod 2009-2011. We undertake to continue to \r\ncontribute within the Commission to the achievement \r\nof these lofty ideals. \r\n Ms. Graham (New Zealand): New Zealand \r\nstrongly supports the role of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in coordinating and integrating post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding activities. The Commission has \r\nalways been an integral component of the wider United \r\nNations reform agenda. Following its establishment, \r\nwe are hopeful that a more comprehensive response to \r\npost-conflict situations will be possible, resulting in \r\nlasting peace. \r\n In the two years since world leaders agreed to \r\nestablish the Peacebuilding Commission, solid progress \r\nhas been made in getting this new body up and running \r\nand on building the support architecture — the Fund \r\nand the Support Office. We are pleased to note that \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n3 07-53726 \r\n \r\noperations in Burundi and Sierra Leone are already \r\nwell underway, following the referrals of those two \r\ncountries to the Commission in 2006. But the \r\nCommission remains in its infancy. Only once the \r\noutcomes of initial projects begin to be evident will it \r\nbe possible to draw some conclusions about the \r\nefficacy of the Commission’s work. \r\n Looking ahead, we recognize that the key to the \r\nbody’s long-term success is its ability to achieve \r\ndemonstrable results in its actual operations. In that \r\nrespect, New Zealand is particularly interested in the \r\ninteraction between the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\nactivities and those of the United Nations and other \r\nagencies working in the field.  \r\n Building capacity in post-conflict situations is not \r\nan activity the United Nations can achieve alone. The \r\nengagement of local authorities, as well as the \r\ninvolvement of civil society elements, both in country \r\nand in New York, in the Commission’s activities, will \r\nbe critical to its success. Even more important will be \r\nensuring coordination and coherence with other aid \r\nagencies and international organizations on the ground. \r\nGreater information exchange between partners in the \r\nfield, donors and Commission members will continue \r\nto be integral in building the continued confidence and \r\nsupport of the wider United Nations membership. In \r\naddition, New Zealand hopes that the rolling out of the \r\n“one United Nations” initiative, as part of efforts to \r\nimprove system-wide coherence of the United Nations \r\nat the country level, will further enhance the operations \r\nof the body. \r\n This year holds particular challenges for the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, and we welcome the \r\nappointment of Japan as the new Chair. Japan will play \r\na key role in shaping the future direction and focus of \r\nthis body. As the year progresses, a key challenge \r\nfacing the Commission will be to ensure that it has \r\nclarity of purpose and a good understanding of the \r\nenvironment on the ground before taking on new \r\ncountries. New Zealand would be wary of moving on \r\nto new countries without a clear understanding of the \r\nlessons learned from the first phases of the Burundi \r\nand Sierra Leone operations. \r\n New Zealand continues to support United Nations \r\nefforts in assisting young and fragile States achieving \r\npeace and prosperity. Like the United Nations, New \r\nZealand has a long history of involvement in the State-\r\nbuilding process in Timor-Leste and is committed to its \r\nsuccess. As last year’s events demonstrated, however, \r\nthe road to stability and development is not going to be \r\nquick or short of challenges. We hope the commitment \r\nof the United Nations will be sustained over the long \r\nterm. There may eventually be a supporting role for the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, provided such assistance is \r\nconsidered appropriate. \r\n As said earlier, a further challenge for the \r\nCommission will be to strive to deliver concrete results \r\nin its first two countries. In order to meet the \r\nexpectations of the membership, comprehensive efforts \r\nand partnerships will be required in the transition from \r\nwar to peace. New Zealand will continue to follow the \r\nCommission’s progress in this regard. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): Over the past year, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has achieved important \r\nresults. The task before us one year ago was certainly \r\nnot an easy one: setting up a whole new body, with its \r\nown rules, procedures and functions, in an area of \r\ncritical relevance to post-conflict countries. \r\n This is why I would like, first and foremost, to \r\ncommend the Angolan Presidency, in the person of \r\nAmbassador Gaspar Martins and his team, for their \r\nexcellent work in leading the Commission through the \r\ninitial stages, when its very foundations were being \r\nbuilt. \r\n Brazil is certain that the Japanese Presidency will \r\nguide the Commission to even more ambitious \r\nachievements. Let me again say how pleased we are to \r\nsee Ambassador Takasu at the helm of this important \r\nbody and, once more, pledge our full support to him in \r\nthe discharge of his responsibilities. \r\n The reports on the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand on the Peacebuilding Fund provide an accurate \r\naccount of the main activities of the Commission, as \r\nwell as of the most important issues that need to be \r\ntackled from now onwards. \r\n Brazil acknowledges the progress made in setting \r\nup the United Nations peacebuilding architecture. \r\nUnder the Dutch coordination, we have been engaged \r\nin defining the basic parameters that will steer our \r\ninvolvement with Sierra Leone. Under the coordination \r\nof Norway, we have agreed on an integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategy, which has proven to be a useful \r\nguide in the path towards consolidating peace in \r\nBurundi. \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 4 \r\n \r\n Yet much remains to be done. The Commission \r\nmust consolidate its identity as an important body in \r\nthe United Nations family, with its own niche and \r\nmandate. It will need to prove its added value as an \r\ninstrument capable of mobilizing resources and \r\ngalvanizing relevant partners into action. The \r\nCommission must not run the risk of being seen merely \r\nas another body in an already crowded aid architecture — \r\nnor must it be seen as an institution devoted to \r\nconceptual discussions that may never come to \r\nfruition. Particular attention should be given, in this \r\ncontext, to the need to strengthen coordination with \r\nother United Nations bodies and the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. Success will be measured by the \r\nCommission’s ability to bring about concrete benefits \r\nto the countries under its consideration.  \r\n Therefore, when it comes to conceiving a \r\nmonitoring and tracking mechanism for the \r\nCommission’s strategies, one must be very cautious not \r\nto place additional burden — either financial or \r\nbureaucratic — on benefiting countries. Such \r\nmonitoring mechanisms should also focus on the \r\ncommitments made by donors and partners, in order to \r\nassure that our joint efforts will actually be translated \r\ninto tangible outcomes. \r\n Brazil supports the issuance of periodic \r\nstatements and recommendations in specific \r\ncircumstances — as we did in the case of Sierra \r\nLeone’s elections and in the face of recent \r\ndevelopments in Burundi. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission should have the flexibility to react, in \r\nvarious forms, as events unfold in countries on its \r\nagenda. By doing so, the Commission actually operates \r\nas a useful early warning system to ward off any \r\ndeterioration in the security or political situation on the \r\nground. \r\n Let me also take this opportunity to commend the \r\nperformance of the Peacebuilding Fund over the past \r\nmonths. The projects already approved for Burundi and \r\nSierra Leone can serve as a means of leveraging further \r\ninvestments in areas of crucial importance for the \r\npeacebuilding process. Brazil also welcomes the \r\nestablishment of an emergency window facility, which \r\nendows the Commission with the necessary agility to \r\nrespond in urgent situations. \r\n We welcome the recent announcement by the \r\nSecretary-General that Liberia will also be eligible for \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund. We hope that resources for \r\nother countries that are currently not on the agenda of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, such as Haiti, could be \r\nmade available as soon as possible. \r\n While bearing in mind the clear distinction \r\nbetween the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, it is important to consider \r\ninnovative ideas to enhance dialogue between them. \r\nMembers should become more familiar with the \r\nprojects being financed by the Peacebuilding Fund, in \r\nline with the priorities set forth by the integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies and the priorities defined by \r\nGovernments in benefiting countries. \r\n Brazil supports the consideration of new \r\ncountries by the Commission. It is our understanding \r\nthat the Commission is ready to grow. It should be able \r\nto deal with other situations that require its attention \r\nand action. In order to do so, however, it is important \r\nthat the working methods are rendered more \r\nexpeditious and result-oriented. Needless to say, the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office should be structured in a \r\nway that is compatible with such mounting demands. \r\nIn particular, we strongly support the inclusion of \r\nGuinea-Bissau in the Commission’s agenda. Its nascent \r\npolitical stability and its efforts towards economic \r\nreconstruction need the attention and the support of the \r\ninternational community. The Commission should \r\nstand by Guinea-Bissau and address the priorities \r\nidentified by its own people and its own Government. \r\n Peacebuilding is a rather complex undertaking, \r\nwhich gathers a wide array of actors both on the \r\nground and abroad. The issue of coordination in \r\ndeveloping recovery strategies therefore stands as a \r\nvital one. Brazil believes that the General Assembly, \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil should pool their efforts to provide the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission with sufficient authority to \r\nproperly discharge its functions. \r\n Brazil also endorses the view that a successful \r\napproach to peacebuilding requires our focused and \r\ncontinuous attention on the strengthening of national \r\ninstitutions, the promotion of reconciliation, reform of \r\nthe justice and security sectors and the advancement of \r\nhuman rights, among other crucially important \r\nactivities. Those efforts, however, should be \r\naccompanied by actions to promote sustainable \r\neconomic and social development. \r\n Inspired by the International Labour Organization’s \r\nwell-known maxim, one could say that poverty \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n5 07-53726 \r\n \r\nanywhere is a threat to peace and prosperity \r\neverywhere. Where poverty reigns, countries find it \r\ndifficult to maintain stability. The Commission’s work \r\nshould therefore allow for the generation of wealth, \r\nemployment and new opportunities — so that the \r\ncountries on its agenda may be able to walk their own \r\npath towards peace and prosperity. \r\n Mr. Palouš (Czech Republic): The Czech \r\nRepublic fully aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe European Union presidency, and I would like to \r\nmake a few additional observations.  \r\n The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nwas one of the most important results of the United \r\nNations reform foreseen by 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome Document (resolution 60/2). The first report \r\non its work and activities (A/62/137) documents the \r\nimportant work accomplished during the first year of \r\nexistence of the Peacebuilding Commission. The Czech \r\nRepublic has the privilege to serve as a member of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission since the beginning of this \r\nyear and took an active part in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s work. \r\n I take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Ismael Gaspar Martins of Angola for his \r\nwork as the first Chairman of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. Under his guidance the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has achieved many important results. My \r\ndelegation is fully confident that his successor, \r\nAmbassador Yukio Takasu of Japan, will further \r\ndevelop this sound foundation. \r\n My country has contributed to the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, and we are happy that the first projects financed \r\nfrom the Fund are being implemented. In the future we \r\nwould appreciate a more prompt reaction of the Fund \r\nto the situation on the ground and more efficient \r\ncooperation between the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand the Peacebuilding Fund based on the regular \r\nexchange of information. \r\n Peacebuilding is a very broad process comprising \r\nthe rehabilitation and reconstruction of the entire \r\nsocio-economic basis. It includes urgent political tasks \r\nto restore the rule of law, including security-sector \r\nreform, to initiate economic reform, and also to \r\ndevelop the educational and health systems. The whole \r\nUnited Nations system, including United Nations \r\nprogrammes and United Nations specialized agencies \r\nlike UNESCO, the World Health Organization, the \r\nInternational Labour Organization and others must take \r\nan active part in those efforts. The United Nations \r\nsystem has to perform as one in the countries on the \r\nagenda of the Peacebuilding Commission. One of the \r\nmost urgent tasks of the Peacebuilding Commission in \r\nthe near future will be promoting cooperation within \r\nthe United Nations system as a whole. \r\n The Czech Republic regards security sector \r\nreform as a very important part of the peacebuilding \r\nprocess. It is not possible to start economic and social \r\nrecovery without reforming the security sector and \r\nwithout creating stable conditions for developing a \r\ndemocratic society and the rule of law. Demobilization \r\nand the fight against illicit small arms and light \r\nweapons are crucial. The Czech Republic has recently \r\nprovided a voluntary contribution of $100,000 for the \r\nregional workshop for African countries that will be \r\norganized by the Office for Disarmament Affairs in \r\nDecember this year in Addis Ababa. The workshop is \r\npart of a broad project aimed at capacity-building for \r\nthe implementation of the international instrument on \r\ntracing illicit small arms and light weapons. The \r\nfinancial contribution of the Czech Republic is part of \r\nits long-term cooperation with the United Nations \r\nwhich will also continue in the future. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission during the first \r\nyear of its existence devoted close attention to the two \r\ncountries on its agenda: Burundi and Sierra Leone. We \r\nhighly appreciate the immense work of the Chairs of \r\nthe country-specific configurations, Ambassador Johan \r\nLøvald and Ambassador Frank Majoor. \r\n Now is time to add other countries to the agenda. \r\nGuinea-Bissau, Timor-Leste and Haiti are countries \r\nmentioned in that connection. In deciding which \r\ncountries should be put on the agenda, we shall take \r\ninto consideration the real needs of the countries, their \r\nactual situation and the role that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission can play in their peacebuilding efforts. \r\nOur decision should not be limited by the \r\norganizational capacities of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission but has to be based on the real needs of \r\nthe respective countries. \r\n One year is too short a period to make a thorough \r\nand final evaluation. Our expectations for the work of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission were very high, and not \r\neverything we hoped for was achieved during the first \r\nyear. But we must be realistic. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has just started its work and was obliged \r\nto deal with such necessary organizational tasks as \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 6 \r\n \r\ndefining its working methods, adopting rules of \r\nprocedures and determining guidelines for participation \r\nof civil society. We hope that in the near future the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission will also find modalities to \r\nallow the full participation of entities such as the \r\nEuropean Community in its meetings, thereby ensuring \r\nthe full involvement of this biggest donor in the \r\npeacebuilding activities. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission is now in a much \r\nbetter position to concentrate its work on the real needs \r\nof the respective countries and their peoples. Therefore \r\nwe look to the future with a lot of optimism. We are \r\nconvinced that the Peacebuilding Commission will \r\nsoon clearly demonstrate its whole potential, to the \r\nbenefit of the people on the ground. \r\n Mr. Mantovani (Italy): Italy wishes to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for organizing this \r\njoint debate, which offers an opportunity to enhance \r\nthe dialogue between Member States on the work and \r\nperspective of the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. \r\n Italy aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nEuropean Union presidency and wishes to focus on \r\nseveral further issues that may help point the debate \r\ntowards concrete steps to take. \r\n Thanks to the efforts of the Chairs, first Angola \r\nand then Japan, we may now verify the concrete \r\nachievements of the Commission in this very first year \r\nof activity. Beginnings are never easy, but the \r\nCommission has succeeded in building up its own \r\ncredibility by adopting rules and working methods, \r\ndeveloping implementation strategies for countries on \r\nthe agenda and involving all the stakeholders by \r\nbringing them together and working towards the same \r\ngoals in order to avoid the wasting of resources and \r\noverlapping of programmes. \r\n In this regard, we stress the importance of having \r\nincluded the European Community, the World Bank, \r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference in the country-specific \r\nconfigurations, and we look forward now to a solution \r\nfor the adequate representation of the European Union. \r\n In the stabilization processes, the involvement of \r\ncivil society is imperative. After the adoption of the \r\nguidelines for its participation in the Commission’s \r\nwork, we now expect an active policy that may \r\nenhance and smooth the relationship. \r\n We wish to express our gratitude to the \r\nNetherlands and Norway in their capacity as Chairs and \r\nCoordinators of the country-specific configurations, \r\nwhich have promoted the work towards the adoption of \r\nthe integrated peacebuilding strategies. We must now \r\nwork to develop a monitoring and tracking mechanism \r\nfor the mutual engagements and trends of the \r\npeacebuilding process, enhancing the participation of \r\nregional and subregional organizations. \r\n By commending the efforts by El Salvador as \r\nChair of the Working Group on Lessons Learned, we \r\nwish to underline the great potential this Group has in \r\nhelping the Commission to better coordinate its work \r\nby fine-tuning the subjects addressed. \r\n One year on, we are ready to move forward, \r\nbuilding on what we have achieved and addressing new \r\nchallenges in a creative and flexible way that may help \r\nin developing policies to fit different situations. \r\n The Commission should now live up to the \r\nambitions that inspired its creation and articulate a \r\nricher and varied agenda by looking at peace processes \r\nas a whole. We cannot establish peacekeeping missions \r\nwithout envisaging, from the beginning, peacebuilding \r\nstrategies. What I mean is that the Commission should \r\nstart reflecting on how to improve its approach towards \r\nthe entire process by assuming a more proactive role, \r\nwithin a wider radar screen, so to say, in order to better \r\nassure the continuity of what is being done, and is \r\nintended to be done, by the international community in \r\norder to stabilize a country. In line with such an \r\napproach, the Commission might become a sort of \r\npermanent observatory for new countries that are on \r\ntheir way to exiting the immediate conflict phase, and \r\nworking together with the Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations, the Department for Political Affairs, the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office and the entire \r\nUnited Nations system in order to be ready, when \r\nrequested, to address critical situations. This should be \r\ndone instead of simply waiting until those situations \r\nare placed before the Commission, as is now the case, \r\nwhich results in a loss of time and, therefore, \r\neffectiveness and efficacy. \r\n The entire process that has the Commission at its \r\ncore should be conceived of as a relay race between all \r\nthe actors involved. If we do not think in terms of \r\nintegrated planning processes, we risk failing, wasting \r\nour efforts and reverting to conflict. \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n7 07-53726 \r\n \r\n Finally, the Commission is more than a donor \r\nconference. If it is true that resources are dramatically \r\nneeded, it is even more important to ensure the best use \r\npossible for those resources and to try to achieve \r\npredictable financing for medium- and long-term \r\ninterventions. \r\n The use of the Peacebuilding Fund may help fill \r\nsome gaps. There must be complementarity with the \r\nCommission’s strategic objectives, but we are aware \r\nthat the two bodies are different instruments and one \r\ndoes not replace the other. \r\n Mrs. Mladineo (Croatia): Allow me to start by \r\nsaying that it has been an honour for my country to \r\nserve as a member of the Peacebuilding Commission at \r\nits first session. Right from the beginning, Croatia took \r\na leading role, along with other friends of the initiative, \r\nin advocating the case for the establishment of the \r\nCommission as an effective and transparent body on \r\nwhich all Member States would have a chance to serve. \r\nWe believed at that time, and we still believe now, that, \r\nprior to the establishment of the Commission, a vital \r\ntool was missing from the arsenal of the United \r\nNations. Now, along with the Peacebuilding Fund and \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office, the Commission \r\nconstitutes the indispensable peacebuilding architecture \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n Croatia would like to stress that it aligns itself \r\nwith the extensive and substantive statement of the \r\nEuropean Union, but we also want to express some of \r\nour own views on the Commission’s achievements in \r\nthe past year. \r\n Today, in the General Assembly, we have in front \r\nof us for the first time the report of the Commission \r\nand the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. As a very active member of the \r\nCommission, we believe that the report reflects \r\naccurately the atmosphere of cooperation and \r\nachievements of the Commission’s first year. We were \r\nof the view that the report should not be a mere factual \r\nrecord of our meetings, but rather a document \r\nrecording our achievements and identifying the \r\nchallenges that lie ahead of us. \r\n The first year of work covered new ground in \r\ntrying to bring more coherence and coordination to \r\npeacebuilding, especially through its impact on the \r\nground for the two countries currently on its agenda, \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone. It has not been easy, as we \r\nhave been faced with both institutional and substantive \r\nchallenges. \r\n A number of things have been accomplished, \r\nthough. The Commission established its rules and \r\nprocedures, guidelines for the participation of civil \r\nsociety in its work and a variety of methods for the \r\nconduct of its work. But, above all, the Commission \r\nadopted the first United Nations peacebuilding \r\ndocument, the Strategic Framework for Peacebuilding \r\nin Burundi, and it is well on its way to finalizing the \r\nSierra Leone compact.  \r\n It has succeeded in mobilizing all stakeholders in \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone around the priorities that \r\nhave been established for the peacebuilding process in \r\nboth countries. This has been a major achievement, \r\nbecause national ownership with all partners and \r\nstakeholders involved is a key to successful \r\npeacebuilding and sustainable development. \r\n However, much still remains to be done. The \r\nCommission needs to develop tracking and monitoring \r\nmechanisms to measure the implementation of \r\nintegrated peacebuilding strategies. To accomplish this, \r\na complete mapping of existing and planned activities \r\nof all partners should be carried out. For this to \r\nsucceed, it is essential that all peacebuilding efforts be \r\nharmonized. During our one-year tenure, we have \r\nrecognized the importance of field missions and we \r\nshould consider ways of financing them. Keeping in \r\nmind our own experience, we supported the Working \r\nGroup on Lessons Learned. It is another important \r\nforum, which gives Commission members a chance to \r\nshare experiences. This practice should be continued \r\nand further developed in order to help countries on the \r\nCommission’s agenda. We can also never stress enough \r\nthat the coordination of other United Nations bodies \r\nand of Bretton Woods institutions and regional and \r\nsubregional organizations with the Commission is of \r\nthe utmost importance. \r\n Let me now turn to the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\nCroatia was one of the Fund’s co-founders and is \r\nhonoured to have a member on its Advisory Board. We \r\nare very happy to see that the first disbursements have \r\nstarted and that the first successful meeting of the \r\nAdvisory Board took place in September. We are of the \r\nview that contributions to the Fund should continue in \r\na predictable way in order to reach the mark of \r\n$250 million in funding. Croatia will certainly continue \r\ncontributing to the extent possible. We hope that \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 8 \r\n \r\ndisbursement mechanisms will be improved so that the \r\nFund can fulfil its role as a catalyst for emergency \r\nfunding. However, long-term funding has to come from \r\nother sources. \r\n It was only a year ago that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission started its work. We strongly believe it \r\nhas achieved much for a new United Nations body. It \r\ncovers territory where many countries have different \r\nunderstandings of what the purpose of such a body \r\nshould be. A lot of positive energy and understanding, \r\nhowever, has been invested in ensuring its good and \r\nproductive start. We are among those who strongly \r\nbelieve in the results-oriented work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, and we are among those \r\nthat are painfully aware of how difficult that goal is. \r\nThis is why our assessment of the first year of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s work is positive: because \r\nwe believe that it has started in the right direction by \r\nmaking a real impact and a real difference on the \r\nground. \r\n Even though Croatia is no longer a member of the \r\nOrganizational Committee of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, it has remained a member of the country-\r\nspecific meeting on Burundi and will continue to share \r\nits experience and lessons learned in post-conflict \r\nrecovery and will try to help make a real impact on the \r\nground. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that with the valuable \r\nexperience of having been a member of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in its first year, we are \r\nready to use that experience in other United Nations \r\ncontexts, such as the Security Council, for a seat on \r\nwhich Croatia is running in the next week’s election. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): Canada is a strong \r\nsupporter of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nbelieves it has a critical role to play in moving the \r\ninternational community beyond ad hoc peacebuilding \r\nefforts. Together, we need to move to more organized \r\nand coherent responses to address the needs of post-\r\nconflict situations in order to build lasting peace.  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Gasper Martins of Angola, \r\nthe outgoing Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nWe thank him for his dedicated work during the \r\nCommission’s formative phase. We would also like to \r\nrecognize the work and key role of the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office, under the able leadership of Assistant \r\nSecretary-General McAskie. Much has been \r\naccomplished in the initial year of operations. As we \r\nlook ahead, Canada welcomes Japan’s chairmanship of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and looks forward to \r\nworking with Japan to ensure continued progress. \r\n Canada was very pleased to note that the country-\r\nspecific meetings in October 2006 on Burundi and \r\nSierra Leone identified key priorities for assistance by \r\nthe Commission. Both countries were declared eligible \r\nfor assistance from the Peacebuilding Fund. We are \r\nhopeful that the work that the Commission is doing to \r\nsupport the national peacebuilding strategies of Sierra \r\nLeone and Burundi will build expertise and develop \r\nanalytical tools. In short, Canada believes that this \r\nwork could identify and address, in an integrated \r\nmanner, key thematic areas for these two post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding situations, as well as lessons learned to \r\nassist in future peacebuilding. The development of \r\neffective monitoring mechanisms will be vital to \r\nensuring the success of these efforts. \r\n We are now about to enter a new phase. Canada \r\nhopes that this will involve the extension of the \r\nCommission’s agenda to other country situations, as \r\nwell as to other thematic issues. Countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict need to know that there is a venue that \r\ncan provide them with long-term support across a \r\nrange of issues. Their interest in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will be a crucial determinant of its \r\nsuccess. \r\n We recognize that this will bring with it new \r\npressures. Canada, therefore, supports an action-\r\noriented, flexible mandate for the Commission, a \r\nmandate that can focus on realistic and achievable \r\nresults. Thematic areas of work should include security \r\nsector and justice sector reform, disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration, gender equality \r\nissues, children and armed conflict and the \r\nimplementation of durable solutions for refugees and \r\ninternally displaced persons, particularly where they \r\nhave been displaced for protracted periods. \r\n We were very encouraged when, at the first \r\ncountry-specific meetings on Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone, the Commission reaffirmed the centrality to its \r\nwork of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on \r\nwomen and peace and security as well as of Council \r\nresolutions on children and armed conflict. The \r\nWorking Group on Lessons Learned should be \r\ndiscussing these thematic issues so that they can be \r\nintegrated into the work of the Commission. \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n9 07-53726 \r\n \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Specifically with respect to the report before us \r\ntoday (A/62/137), we welcome the references to the \r\nneed to strengthen the relevance of peacebuilding \r\nstrategies as a tool to generate support for \r\npeacebuilding in the countries under Commission \r\nconsideration. We very much support the call for the \r\nCommission to engage in further dialogue with all \r\nrelevant stakeholders, donor countries and the broader \r\nUnited Nations system. \r\n As the work of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nevolves, it is necessary to take a hard look at its \r\nfunctions and mandates to maximize its effectiveness \r\nas an intergovernmental body. The Commission is an \r\nimportant component of the wider United Nations \r\nreform agenda, including proposed reforms to the \r\ninternational peace and security architecture. This \r\nincludes efforts to enhance United Nations human \r\nrights capacity, to strengthen humanitarian action and \r\nto better protect civilian populations. The transition \r\nfrom war to lasting peace requires comprehensive, \r\nconcerted efforts to prevent a return to conflict and \r\ndisplacement. \r\n We look forward to working with the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in the coming months and \r\nyears as it works to clarify its role and make a useful \r\ncontribution to the very important task of building \r\npeace in countries emerging from conflict situations. \r\n Mr. Antonio (Angola) (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of Ambassador Gaspar Martins, who would have \r\nliked to be here at this historic moment were it not for \r\ncircumstances beyond his control, and on behalf of the \r\nAngolan delegation, I would like, at the outset, to say \r\nhow pleased we are to see you, Sir, presiding over our \r\nwork. We assure you of the full cooperation of the \r\nAngolan delegation. \r\n I would also like to congratulate Ambassador \r\nTakasu of Japan on his presentation of the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/62/137), which \r\nfaithfully reflects the outcome of the tireless work by \r\nthe Commission in its two country-specific \r\nconfigurations during the first year of an experience, \r\ndifficult at times, but also interesting. It was interesting \r\nbecause it enabled the Organization to acquire a new \r\nstructure which, if we give it the means it needs and \r\ncontinue to give it the same attention, will clearly make \r\na difference in the quest for solutions to the challenges \r\nraised by post-conflict situations. \r\n The report (A/62/138) before us today on that \r\nimportant instrument, the Peacebuilding Fund, also \r\ndeserves our attention. We welcome the impact that the \r\nFund is beginning to have in the field. My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the caucus of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n It will be recalled that, in February this year, \r\nAmbassador Ismael Gaspar Martins had the distinct \r\nhonour to address the Assembly, as Chairman of the \r\nCommission, to stress the capital importance of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which is a cornerstone of \r\nthe new United Nations peacebuilding architecture and \r\nan important outcome of the reform of our \r\nOrganization.  \r\n During their first year of activities, the three \r\npillars of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture — the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund — were all in a development phase. In particular, \r\nthat phase was characterized by efforts to establish \r\nstructures and to introduce innovative working \r\nmethods, as well as channels for interaction with \r\ncountries on the agenda, other United Nations bodies, \r\nvarious United Nations departments, donors, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and the media. \r\n Angola is very honoured to have been Chair of \r\nthe Commission during that critical phase and to have \r\nmade its humble contribution to the founding ideas that \r\nguided the Commission during that initial stage, thanks \r\nto the support of Member States, particularly those \r\nbelonging to the Commission — the delegations of \r\nNorway, El Salvador and the Netherlands — and the \r\nsupport of the Peacebuilding Support Office. We are \r\nparticularly moved by the very kind words that several \r\ndelegations have been good enough to say in that \r\nregard, particularly about Ambassador Ismael Gaspar \r\nMartins, the former Chairman. \r\n The first report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(A/62/137) attests clearly to the progress made and \r\nremaining challenges to be overcome. Indeed, the \r\nreport is innovative, in addition to being very frank \r\nregarding the considerable efforts still necessary to \r\naddress the challenges to be faced by the Commission. \r\nThe United Nations peacebuilding architecture has the \r\npotential to emerge as an important tool for the \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 10 \r\n \r\ninternational community in its efforts to prevent \r\ncountries from relapsing into cycles of conflict. \r\n During the second phase of activities, it is \r\nplanned that the role and the functions of the various \r\ncomponents of the peacebuilding architecture will \r\ndevelop further. It is anticipated that a dynamic and \r\nmutually reinforcing relationship among the three \r\npillars of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture, as well as between them and other bodies \r\nworking on the ground, will be fine-tuned.  \r\n This debate thus offers all Member States a \r\nunique opportunity to contribute to the improvement of \r\nthe working methods of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture, given the interest that we \r\nhave all had in its establishment within the framework \r\nof the reform that we have long sought. Therefore, we \r\nmust take this opportunity to benefit from the \r\nviewpoints and input of all those who can contribute to \r\npeacebuilding, particularly countries that have \r\nsuccessfully managed post-conflict situations and that \r\nhave the knowledge and experience necessary for \r\nsimilar situations.  \r\n In the view of my delegation, the following \r\nelements could be crucial for the future of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. \r\n First, we must continue to consider national \r\nownership as an important principle for peacebuilding \r\nin countries on the Commission’s agenda, particularly \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone.  \r\n Second, the Commission will have to continue to \r\noperate within a flexible, transparent and inclusive \r\nframework that promotes the development of \r\npartnerships with national, regional and international \r\nactors.  \r\n Third, the importance of the unique composition \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission will be judged on the \r\nbasis of the commitment of its members to the cause of \r\npeacebuilding and of their contributions to the \r\nCommission’s activities. \r\n Fourth, while it is essential that the Commission \r\ncontinue to pay particular attention to formulating \r\nadvice related to peacebuilding in Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone, it needs to consider how it will be able to meet \r\nrequests from other countries emerging from conflict, \r\nthrough mechanisms established under the Commission’s \r\nfounding resolutions. \r\n Fifth, a year of activities has permitted the \r\nCommission to accumulate experience enabling it to \r\nbegin to think about its working methods and, as a \r\nresult, about improvements to be made to its \r\nprovisional rules of procedure.  \r\n Sixth, in the context of improving the relationship \r\namong the components of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture, it is important to redefine the relationship \r\nbetween the Peacebuilding Fund and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n Seventh, providing the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice with the financial resources necessary for its \r\nfunctioning must be a concern for all Member States.  \r\n Eighth, the flexibility demonstrated in the \r\ndisbursement of the Peacebuilding Fund’s funds for \r\nemergency situations — funds that have enabled us to \r\nfinance a number of activities in Côte d’Ivoire and the \r\nCentral African Republic — must be encouraged. That \r\nflexibility should also serve as an example for \r\nnarrowing the gap between the Fund’s decision-making \r\nand its disbursements to the countries concerned.  \r\n Ninth, Member States’ contributions to the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund are proving to be crucial, \r\nincluding for continued flexibility in disbursement for \r\nemergency situations. \r\n In conclusion, I should particularly like to wish \r\nevery success to the Japanese Chair, to the team in the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office and to the delegations of \r\nEl Salvador, Norway, Ghana and the Netherlands in \r\ncarrying out their tasks for the Commission. In \r\nparticular, we assure them of the cooperation of the \r\nAngolan delegation. We have fond memories of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office, with which we had the \r\nvery great pleasure to share unforgettable moments at \r\nthe inception of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Mr. Pfanzelter (Austria): Austria welcomes this \r\nopportunity to discuss the reports of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Peacebuilding Fund a little more \r\nthan a year after those organs became operational. The \r\nGeneral Assembly can now reflect on the experiences \r\nof the past year and on the lessons learned in the work \r\nof the Commission. \r\n Austria fully aligns itself with the statement just \r\ndelivered by the representative of Portugal on behalf of \r\nthe European Union. I will therefore focus on only two \r\npoints. \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n11 07-53726 \r\n \r\n First, Austria attaches special importance to the \r\nsystematic integration of a gender perspective into all \r\naspects of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nWe believe that gender-specific responses to the \r\nchallenges of peacebuilding, as well as the systematic \r\nparticipation of women in all aspects of peacebuilding \r\nprocesses, are essential prerequisites for the success \r\nand long-term sustainability of peacebuilding efforts. \r\nWe are heartened by the experience of the past year, \r\nwhich shows that, both within the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office and within the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, there is a high degree of awareness of the \r\nneed to accord special attention to issues of gender. \r\n Gender mainstreaming, as well as the rights and \r\nneeds of women and girls, figure in both the Strategic \r\nFramework for Peacebuilding in Burundi and the draft \r\nframework for cooperation in Sierra Leone. In practice, \r\nhowever, it often seems to be difficult to translate the \r\ngeneral recognition of the importance of gender into \r\nconcrete measures and to commit to their \r\nimplementation. All stakeholders need to make more \r\nefforts not to fall into the post-conflict trap of focusing \r\nalmost exclusively on the so-called angry young men, \r\nwhile neglecting the needs and rights of women.  \r\n Austria believes that in its second year the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission needs to do more to ensure \r\nthat the general commitment to gender mainstreaming \r\nis adequately reflected in all documents and strategies \r\nemanating from the joint endeavours of all \r\nstakeholders.  \r\n Secondly, Austria appreciates the establishment \r\nof the Peacebuilding Fund as an important complement \r\nto the Commission. We believe it can be a very useful \r\ntool through its creative approach aimed at filling gaps \r\nin immediate post-conflict situations that are not \r\nadequately addressed by other mechanisms. We believe \r\nthat allocations of resources from the Fund need to \r\nfocus on this core role. Being convinced of the \r\ninnovative nature the Fund represents and of its \r\nusefulness, Austria decided to contribute substantially \r\nto the Fund. I am happy to report that Austria is one of \r\nthe few countries that have already contributed twice to \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund, in both 2006 and 2007.  \r\n For Austria, contributing to the Fund was a \r\ndeparture from the established mechanisms of \r\ndevelopment assistance. We are glad to see that Sierra \r\nLeone and Burundi were accorded $35 million each. \r\nWe also attach great importance to the allocation of \r\nresources to countries that are not on the agenda of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, in accordance with the \r\nterms of reference of the Fund. Since the Peacebuilding \r\nFund is institutionally independent of the Commission, \r\nallocations from the Fund are not linked to the \r\ninscription of a country on the agenda of the \r\nCommission. The allocation of financial resources to \r\ndialogue processes in Côte d’Ivoire and in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic is an important step in this context. \r\nAustria hopes to see similar contributions in similar \r\nsituations in the near future.  \r\n Ms. Lisson (Australia): Australia continues to be \r\na strong supporter of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nWe were a key advocate for the establishment of the \r\nCommission during the 2005 United Nations World \r\nSummit, and we consider the Commission as a key \r\noutcome of that Summit. Australia was also one of the \r\nfirst donors to the Peacebuilding Fund.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission has a critical role \r\nto play in post-conflict countries, supporting and \r\ncoordinating the peacebuilding work of the United \r\nNations and the broader international community in \r\nsupport of countries’ own efforts. The Commission is \r\ncharged with ensuring that our combined efforts are \r\nboth strategic and coherent. It is designed to fill a \r\ncritical gap in the architecture of the United Nations.  \r\n Establishing the Peacebuilding Commission took \r\ntime, and understandably, a considerable amount of its \r\nactivities in the first year were focused on \r\nadministrative matters. We welcome the adoption of \r\nprovisional rules of procedure and are pleased that \r\npreliminary guidelines for the involvement of civil \r\nsociety have been settled. We are also pleased that \r\narrangements are now in place for the participation of \r\nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and \r\nother institutional donors.  \r\n While such a focus on administrative matters was \r\nnecessary, we hope this more formative period is now \r\nbehind us. The focus of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nmust now be more fully on how it can best play its role \r\nof supporting countries emerging from conflict to lay \r\nthe foundation for sustainable development.  \r\n Australia welcomes the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/62/137) and the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the Peacebuilding Fund \r\n(A/62/138).  \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 12 \r\n \r\n In relation to the Peacebuilding Commission, it is \r\npositive that the report outlines lessons learned, many \r\nof which are focused on how to maximize country \r\nownership and involvement in the post-conflict \r\nrecovery process. We fully support this focus and \r\nwelcome the establishment by the Commission of a \r\nworking group on lessons learned to accumulate best \r\npractices and lessons learned on critical peacebuilding \r\nissues.  \r\n In relation to the Peacebuilding Fund, we are \r\ngrateful for the analysis not just of the Fund’s \r\noperation, but also of how it can be improved to ensure \r\nefficient, quick and accountable disbursement of funds \r\nfor peacebuilding activities, in line with the guidelines \r\nestablished for the Fund.  \r\n The Secretary-General recognizes there is further \r\nwork to be done on strengthening the relevance of \r\nintegrated peacebuilding strategies and coordination \r\nwith all relevant actors, including those outside of the \r\nUnited Nations system. We consider both to be \r\nimportant and support the Secretary-General in these \r\nendeavours.  \r\n The relationship between the Commission and \r\nother intergovernmental bodies, especially the Security \r\nCouncil, is critical. Good working relationships \r\nbetween all relevant bodies and close collaboration at \r\ntimes will be essential to the success of the \r\nCommission. Important also is the role of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office and the cooperation of \r\nall United Nations agencies, funds and programmes in \r\npeacebuilding efforts. We urge continued strengthening \r\nof coordination of this level also.  \r\n Australia considers that a further critical issue for \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission is for it to be very clear \r\non the specific value it can add to each country on its \r\nagenda. The Commission needs to recognize that its \r\nrole will be different depending on the specific country \r\nneeds and the mechanisms, plans and strategies already \r\nin place. The Commission must be nimble and \r\nresponsive to the challenges and needs of each country \r\nit considers. An analysis, even after such a relatively \r\nshort period of operation, of how the Commission is \r\ncontributing to peacebuilding efforts in Sierra Leone \r\nand Burundi would be useful, especially as the \r\nCommission begins to consider where it might next \r\nfocus its attention.  \r\n Our hopes and expectations for what the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission can deliver are high, as \r\nthey have been from its conception. We recognize that \r\nit is still early days of its operation and that it takes \r\ntime for any new body to learn and apply lessons and \r\nto refine its processes and strategies. However, given \r\nthe need for the Commission’s support, the \r\nCommission must learn and improve as quickly as \r\npossible to ensure that it is delivering maximum \r\nresults. Australia stands ready to work with the \r\nCommission and other Member States to realize this \r\nobjective.  \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation would like to begin by thanking the \r\nPresident for convening this important debate. \r\nSecondly, we would like to congratulate Ambassador \r\nGaspar Martins of Angola for his important work in \r\nheading the Peacebuilding Commission during its first \r\nyear of operation. Also, we would like to wish \r\nAmbassador Yukio Takasu, the Commission’s current \r\nChairperson, every success and assure him of our \r\ncollaboration.  \r\n Chile welcomes this first report by the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/62/137), which reflects \r\nnot only the activities carried out, but also \r\nacknowledges the main obstacles and challenges that \r\nremain.  \r\n The Commission has successfully emerged from \r\nits first year of operation. Of course, there are pending \r\nmatters, in particular the establishment of a useful and \r\nefficient mechanism to track and monitor the \r\nframework agreements reached by the Commission \r\nwith the countries under its consideration.  \r\n The principles of national capacity and the \r\npriorities identified by the countries themselves \r\ncontinue to be the cornerstones of the Commission’s \r\nactivities on the ground. That allows the Commission’s \r\nwork to become yet another element of the \r\ndevelopment and recovery policies that national \r\nauthorities have identified for post-conflict recovery.  \r\n Furthermore, the Commission’s central role as \r\ncatalyst for the main stakeholders and the resources \r\nmade available to countries for their post-conflict \r\nstrategies continue to be of key importance. The \r\nCommission’s coordination with the international \r\nfinancial institutions is, we feel, of prime importance, \r\nand we support the idea put forth by its Chairman to \r\nestablish a direct and dynamic link with those bodies.  \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n13 07-53726 \r\n \r\n The report on the Peacebuilding Fund reveals that \r\nwe have yet to meet the target of $250 million \r\nestablished for its founding. My delegation trusts in the \r\ngenerosity of all, particularly of the developed \r\ncountries, to reach that sum as soon as possible. The \r\nFund report also draws attention to how that body has \r\nbeen able to take advantage of existing organic \r\nstructures of the United Nations systems. Indeed, the \r\ndelegation of responsibility for the fiduciary \r\nmanagement of the Fund to the Multi-Donor Trust \r\nFund Office clearly demonstrated how to maximize the \r\nbenefits of the Organization’s current structure without \r\nthe need to create new mechanisms.  \r\n My delegation welcomes the recommendation \r\nmade in the report relating to the Fund’s participation \r\nin two post-conflict phases — the first devoted to \r\nsocieties that have recently emerged from conflict and \r\nare taking critical and urgent peacebuilding measures, \r\nand the second devoted to funding projects pursuant to \r\nthe strategic frameworks agreed between the \r\nCommission and the country under consideration. We \r\ncan thereby avoid the occasional emergence of \r\nfrustration over the slow pace of discussions and \r\nnegotiations between the Commission and the country \r\nunder consideration.  \r\n On the subject of the Peacebuilding Fund, we feel \r\nit important to note that prior coordination is required \r\nbetween the Secretary-General and the Commission \r\nwhen the former wishes to declare a country eligible \r\nfor access to the Fund’s resources. Given that this \r\nfaculty is established in the Fund’s terms of reference, \r\nwe feel it desirable to ensure due coordination between \r\nthe Organizational Committee and the Commission in \r\norder to ensure that other countries are not encouraged \r\nto apply directly to the Secretary-General for funds \r\nwithout placing themselves under the Commission’s \r\nconsideration. We recall that the Commission’s role \r\ntranscends the mere delivery of resources; its \r\nmultifaceted role and its presence on the ground should \r\nbe encouraged.  \r\n Finally, I take this opportunity to express \r\ngratitude for the important support work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office, without whose \r\ncooperation the Commission would be unable to \r\nresolve its own organizational problems, and to \r\nwelcome the establishment of that new United Nations \r\nbody.  \r\n Mr. Staur (Denmark): I thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for providing this opportunity to \r\ndiscuss one of the major achievements of the United \r\nNations reform process — the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission.  \r\n I would first of all like to align myself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Portugal on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. Let me also begin by \r\nthanking the Chairmen of the Organizational \r\nCommittee and the country-specific configurations for \r\ntheir valuable work and for the progress achieved \r\nunder their leadership.  \r\n The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nmarked an important milestone for the United Nations. \r\nThe need to address the difficult process from peace \r\nconsolidation, humanitarian assistance and early \r\nrecovery in post-conflict situations, through \r\nreconstruction to development, is obvious and difficult. \r\nThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions for those \r\ncomplicated post-conflict situations.  \r\n Building peace is all about building bridges \r\nbetween actors within and outside the country or \r\nregion in question. At the same time, building peace \r\nrequires a clear assessment of short-, medium- and \r\nlong-term needs and a clear commitment from the \r\ninternational community to do its utmost to meet those \r\nneeds. In other words, the environment in which we \r\nhave created the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nmandate we have entrusted it with are indeed complex \r\nand difficult, in terms of both the number of different \r\nactors involved and the complexities of the issues at \r\nhand. The challenges that the Commission is now \r\nfacing are the same that we have been dealing with for \r\ndecades, and it is fair to say not without some failures \r\nand shortcomings.  \r\n Those challenges are close to what we could call \r\nthe core business of the United Nations itself and a \r\nfield of challenges that could be considered one of the \r\nmost strategically important to the United Nations \r\nsystem. In the eyes of the public, building peace and \r\npreventing the re-emergence of conflict and war are \r\namong the most important yardsticks for measuring the \r\nrelevance and effectiveness of the United Nations.  \r\n Against that background, it is no wonder that we \r\nhave all had great expectations as to what the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission can and should do. Little \r\nmore than a year into the life of the Commission, we \r\nmust, however be realistic in trying to evaluate its \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 14 \r\n \r\nwork so far. There is a limit to what can realistically be \r\nachieved over a short time span. On the other hand, it \r\nis important that we address what some consider the \r\nshortfalls or challenges of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, and I would like to highlight a number of \r\nthose challenges in this statement.  \r\n It is an important achievement that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission succeeded in developing \r\nand defining the concept of integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies. That has enabled the Commission to draw \r\nup the specific Strategic Framework for Burundi as \r\nwell as the Sierra Leone draft integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategy framework for cooperation. The Commission \r\nhas carried out important field visits and helped set an \r\nagenda for peacebuilding, and it has brought \r\nstakeholders together locally and internationally.  \r\n After a year in which much focus has been on the \r\ninternal questions and working methods of the \r\nCommission, we now need to focus on outward-\r\nlooking activities and actual progress on the ground. \r\nThe innovative modalities of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and its focus at the country level should \r\nhelp it to become a forum inspiring concerted action, \r\nrather than being a talking shop with limited influence \r\non the situation on the ground. Hopefully, the agenda \r\nof the Organizational Committee will be shorter in the \r\nyear to come. Emphasis on and support for pragmatic \r\nand flexible working methods are crucial.  \r\n The capacity, experience and sense of ownership \r\nof many non-governmental organizations and other \r\ncivil society actors are resources that the Commission \r\nshould draw upon. Likewise, it should draw upon the \r\nunique resources of various African institutions and \r\norganizations, especially at the field level. National \r\nownership of and regional support for peacebuilding \r\nprocesses are crucial; there is therefore a need for \r\nincreased activity of the Commission in the field, as \r\nopposed to in New York. One of the Commission’s \r\nunique features is precisely the possibility of bringing \r\ntogether all partners on the ground, including those that \r\ndisagree and those of civil society.  \r\n The PBC would benefit from discussions on how \r\nto prioritize the many relevant issues pertaining to \r\npeacebuilding. That cannot be done once and for all but \r\nwould, of course, depend on the specific conditions in \r\nthe country affected and the situation at hand. The key \r\nto priority-setting should be an informed discussion on \r\nthe prioritizing and sequencing of such issues as good \r\ngovernance, security sector reform, disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration, human rights, job \r\ncreation and so on. The Peacebuilding Commission \r\nwill need to work closely with humanitarian partners, \r\nwith peacekeeping forces, and with development \r\npartners in fleshing out those priorities.  \r\n The relationship with the Security Council and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council should be further \r\ndeveloped in the time to come. It seems that all three \r\ninstitutions would benefit from more interaction on \r\nspecific issues. An example would be the Security \r\nCouncil seeking information and specific advice on \r\npeacebuilding matters when deciding on mandates for \r\npeacekeeping missions.  \r\n A specific challenge for the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is to mainstream and increase its outreach \r\nactivities. The visibility of the Commission is crucial \r\nin maintaining its momentum and in creating increased \r\nawareness about its work — both locally and globally. \r\nTo this end, increased use of the Internet and the \r\ndrawing up of communications strategies specifically \r\nto be used in the countries on the agenda, as well as at \r\nthe global level, would be useful.  \r\n We need to work harder to ensure that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission helps to mobilize and \r\nmarshal sustained and predictable resources for \r\npeacebuilding. We need to define how other countries \r\ncan be declared eligible for support from the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and to ensure that such funds are \r\navailable — as intended — to fund gaps at the earliest \r\nstages of a recovery process. Progress has been made \r\nwith regards to disbursements, but there is still some \r\nway to go in this regard.  \r\n However, this should not deter us from \r\ncontinuing our common endeavours to ensure that the \r\nnecessary resources are available to the Fund in the \r\nfuture. This availability is crucial if the Fund is to be \r\nable to provide rapid-release funds and seed money \r\nwhen new countries are added to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission agenda.  \r\n At the same time, we must, of course, remain \r\ncognizant of the fact that the Peacebuilding Fund will \r\nonly cover a minor part of the total costs of \r\npeacebuilding in all post-conflict situations and that the \r\nbulk of funding will have to be provided through other \r\nchannels. The various funds and programmes and the \r\ninternational financial institutions, including the World \r\nBank and the African Development Bank, are very \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n15 07-53726 \r\n \r\nimportant in this regard, and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission could play a useful role in bringing \r\ntogether these actors in discussions about sustainable \r\nfunding.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission should be ready \r\nto consider new countries for its agenda. When \r\nconsidering countries for its agenda, priority should be \r\ngiven to countries with a particular need for \r\ncoordinated international action and additional \r\nrecovery financing. In dealing with new countries, the \r\nlessons learned so far should be drawn upon.  \r\n Finally, I would like to underline the importance \r\nof the standing invitation extended to the European \r\nUnion, as an institutional donor, to participate in the \r\nmeetings of the Peacebuilding Commission. We fully \r\nsupport the arrangement finally being implemented \r\nallowing for an adequate representation of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU), given the major contributions \r\nthat the EU makes.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission has a very real \r\nchance of becoming a success, not just in its own right, \r\nbut for the United Nations as a whole. It definitely \r\nhighlights the important role that the United Nations \r\nsystem can — and should — play in bridging the gap \r\nfrom early recovery to development. The United \r\nNations system has a unique potential in fulfilling this \r\nrole and, as Member States, we all have an important \r\nobligation to support the United Nations in this regard.  \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French): \r\nMy delegation is very pleased by the publication of the \r\nfirst report of the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the Peacebuilding Fund, \r\nwhich has sparked a debate as interesting as it is \r\ninformative. I see here the eloquent proof of our \r\ncommitment to make this Commission a core tool in \r\npeacebuilding worldwide.  \r\n The unique nature of this Commission is that it is \r\nrepresentative of the United Nations as it stands today. \r\nThe Commission is, in fact, composed of members \r\nfrom the General Assembly, the Security Council, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, as well as countries that \r\ncontribute the most, those which we call the troop-\r\ncontributing countries. I believe that when our heads of \r\nState adopted the Summit Outcome Document in 2005, \r\nwe not only raised the major issue of how to ensure \r\nthat there is no gap between the end of the operations \r\nrun by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in a \r\ngiven country and the post-conflict situation. There is \r\nthe need to ensure that post-conflict countries do not \r\nfall back into those difficulties that we are only too \r\naware of, back into those tragedies that we have had to \r\novercome in some countries. This tool is, therefore, \r\nnecessary and was created by the General Assembly.  \r\n Today, one year later, all the statements made \r\nhere this morning, beginning with that of the President \r\nof the General Assembly, attest to the approval and the \r\npositive assessment given to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and its work. I would like, then, to thank, \r\nhere and now, all of those who have contributed, \r\nespecially the members of the Commission, of course. \r\nBut, I would like especially to note the remarkable \r\nwork done by our distinguished colleague, Ambassador \r\nIsmael Gaspar Martins of Angola, the first Chair of the \r\nCommission. I would like to add that other colleagues, \r\nour colleagues from El Salvador as well as our \r\ncolleague from Norway and, of course, our colleague, \r\nFrank Majoor, from the Netherlands, greatly \r\ncontributed to the success that we are all acclaiming \r\ntoday.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission is, in reality, our \r\nsubsidiary body; something new that we ourselves \r\ncreated to enable us to respond in a useful, practical \r\nand efficient manner to this necessity to reform the \r\nUnited Nations, to respond to the tragedy that plagues \r\nmany countries, especially in Africa, tragedies that \r\nrequire not only demonstrations of solidarity, such as \r\nwe hear in the statements made here, but especially \r\nconcrete actions that could make a difference and \r\nprovide hope to the peoples involved.  \r\n This is what the Commission has done and this is \r\nwhat the Commission is called upon to do. Obviously, \r\nit is not yet all perfect. I believe that the report attests \r\nto the determination of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand its members to ensure that that same energy \r\ncontinues, that through our brainstorming and \r\ninnovative ideas we will be able to meet challenges and \r\nprovide concrete results.  \r\n I would like to sincerely thank the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office that was created to this end and which \r\nhas been so excellently led by Ms. McAskie, the \r\nAssistant Secretary-General. She and her team have \r\nshown imagination, creativity and resolve, because it is \r\nnot easy to convince Member States, particularly when \r\nyou are offering something new, new ideas. Very \r\nfrequently, we are somewhat resistant to new ideas. We \r\nwonder whether something will be successful, whether \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 16 \r\n \r\nit will make a difference. Well, in a word, yes. I think \r\nthis team is a winning team and we need to give it the \r\nnecessary support. We need to ensure that, together, we \r\nwill be able to work to meet our commitments, \r\ncollectively assume our responsibilities.  \r\n This is what the Peacebuilding Commission is \r\ndoing. It is not just another structure, just another \r\nsubsidiary body of the United Nations. It is something \r\nthat is useful, something that will contribute to \r\nbringing peace to peoples who have been in conflict. \r\nFurthermore, it is something that will contribute to \r\ngiving them hope, especially thanks to the financial \r\ncontributions that will be made.  \r\n But let us not be misled. This is not just a matter \r\nof financial support. The role of the Commission is to \r\nmake sure that we can establish a useful dialogue and \r\npartnership with the beneficiary countries, so that we \r\ncan work hand in hand.  \r\n There is also the issue of ownership, which is \r\nfundamental. But let us be pragmatic. Ownership is a \r\nmatter of principle, but it must be assumed in a spirit \r\nof partnership because any country emerging from \r\nconflict is not a position to undertake every task on its \r\nown. That country therefore needs the support of the \r\ninternational community through the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, and specifically the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office. I therefore say yes to ownership in \r\nprinciple, but submit that it needs to be intelligently \r\nand pragmatically managed so as to ensure that we can \r\ndraw the optimal benefit not only from all those \r\npresent in this Hall who are prepared to help and have \r\nindicated their willingness to do so, but above all from \r\nthe willingness of the members of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and its Support Office.  \r\n I may be wrong, but one might imagine that the \r\nCommission could do better. We should not, however, \r\nbe unduly hasty. I think that, considering that the \r\nCommission was so recently created and did not even \r\nexist a year ago, it is still trying to find itself. It is \r\nfinding its own way, I believe, and will soon reach its \r\nnatural cruising speed. The evidence for that is \r\nirrefutable. We have all heard here expressions of \r\nsatisfaction with the Commission and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office.  \r\n I should therefore like to hope that we, members \r\nand non-members alike, will further mobilize \r\nourselves, as well as the international community, to \r\nensure that the Commission can move forward, build \r\non its achievements, be even more innovative, and \r\nmake effective contributions to building new, peaceful \r\nsocieties and to achieving national reconciliation in the \r\ncountries involved.  \r\n With respect to the Peacebuilding Fund, one \r\nwould obviously hope that it will be able to disburse \r\nmore quickly, but judging from the standard procedures \r\nof other United Nations organs and bodies, I believe it \r\nwould not be mistaken to feel that the Fund is working \r\nat an acceptable pace. We need to give it time, too, to \r\nlearn to manage its affairs transparently, because we \r\nrequire transparent management, and to ensure that \r\navailable funds are disbursed to good effect. That is the \r\nkey; more important than the pace of disbursement is \r\nknowing where the money will go and to what purpose, \r\nand ensuring that it will have an impact in terms of \r\nbuilding new societies and peace in the countries \r\ninvolved.  \r\n I have every confidence in the Fund’s managers \r\nand in the Secretary-General, and am very pleased that \r\nhe has decided to declare Liberia eligible. Who here is \r\nnot in solidarity with Liberia after all the suffering and \r\nhardship it has endured? Who here would not agree to \r\nabide by the Secretary-General’s decision with respect \r\nto a country as devastated as Liberia? I think his is a \r\ngood decision and must be supported. The best way to \r\nsupport it is to invite not only the traditional donor \r\ncountries, but all of us — including my country — to \r\nmake a gesture, howsoever symbolic, of contribution to \r\nthe Fund. That will make a difference and effect \r\nimportant changes, bolstering our claims to be devoted \r\nto peace, justice and freedom, and ensuring that the \r\nUnited Nations ideals are not only practiced but are \r\nanchored in a culture of peace established throughout \r\nthe world. That is what we need to do in supporting the \r\nCommission, Ms. McAskie and her team, and the \r\nSecretary-General so that the Commission can move \r\nforward and continue to innovate and so that the \r\neffective results enumerated in the current report can \r\nbe even more satisfactory in the next.  \r\n Mr. Pemagbi (Sierra Leone): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the members of \r\nthe Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission that are members of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission is a baby that has \r\ngrown fast. That rapid development is the product of \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n17 07-53726 \r\n \r\ncooperation by members of the Organizational \r\nCommittee and its first Chairman, Ambassador Gaspar \r\nMartins; an able Support Office with excellent \r\nleadership; highly dedicated country-specific meeting \r\nchairmen for Burundi and Sierra Leone; and the \r\nAmbassador of El Salvador, who has led us with \r\nconsiderable insight in our exploration of experiences \r\nand best practices in peacebuilding. Of course, without \r\nfinancial support, the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nwould have been a stunted baby. Sierra Leone thanks \r\nall involved. I assure them that their sacrifice will \r\nnever be in vain.  \r\n Sierra Leone is, of course, one of the two specific \r\ncountries selected for consideration on the agenda of \r\nthe new mechanism for post-conflict cooperation. \r\nAccordingly, we would like to add a few points to this \r\njoint debate on the first year of its operation. Our views \r\nshould help to throw light on any evaluation of the \r\nachievements and lessons learned so far. Hopefully, our \r\nintervention will also contribute to forthcoming \r\ndiscussions on the way ahead for both the Commission \r\nand the Fund.  \r\n From the outset, particularly during the series of \r\nconsultations on the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, Sierra Leone has always been curious to \r\nknow whether and how it would benefit from the \r\nCommission. Today, one year after it came into \r\noperation, we can confidently say that Sierra Leone has \r\nindeed benefited immensely from that innovative \r\nmechanism.  \r\n In his maiden address to Parliament last Friday, \r\nthe new President of Sierra Leone, Mr. Ernest Bai \r\nKoroma, assured the United Nations that his \r\nGovernment will take full advantage of the \r\nopportunities provided by the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. The four priority areas that were \r\nidentified last year — youth employment and \r\nempowerment, justice and security sector reform, good \r\ngovernance and capacity-building — are still valid. \r\nThey are consistent with the main thrust of the \r\nPresident’s policy address to Parliament. For instance, \r\nhe spoke about a new Sierra Leone where young \r\npeople will train and work to live productive lives. He \r\nalso emphasized good governance, civil service reform, \r\njustice and the rule of law, and peacebuilding.  \r\n In that regard, there should be no doubt \r\nwhatsoever about the commitment of the new \r\nadministration in Sierra Leone to the proposed \r\nintegrated peacebuilding strategy or cooperation \r\nframework. The current visit to Sierra Leone by the \r\nChairman of the Sierra Leone country-specific meeting \r\nof the Commission, Ambassador Frank Majoor of the \r\nNetherlands, is intended to contribute to the process of \r\nrefining and finalizing the text of the framework for \r\ncooperation and partnership between the Government \r\nof Sierra Leone and the Peacebuilding Commission.  \r\n Meanwhile, we would like to reiterate that \r\nnational ownership should be the cardinal principle of \r\nthe cooperation framework. Secondly, due account \r\nshould be taken of the full scope of the Commission’s \r\nmandate. In other words, we must not forget that the \r\nCommission is also mandated to marshal resources at \r\nthe disposal of the international community and to help \r\nensure predictable financing, not only for early \r\nrecovery activities, but also for sustained investment \r\nover the medium and long terms.  \r\n While we cannot overemphasize the importance \r\nof resources through the Peacebuilding Fund, we \r\nbelieve that the new peacebuilding mechanism \r\nenvisaged by the heads of State and Government in \r\n2005 rests not on one, but on three pillars: the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice and the Peacebuilding Fund. Those three entities \r\nmust work together and coordinate their activities \r\neffectively with other stakeholders, at the country \r\nlevel. Of course, we share the view that the \r\nrelationship between the Fund and the Commission \r\nshould be clearly set out, especially to remove the \r\nmisperception that disbursement of money is the \r\nresponsibility of the Commission. We note with \r\nappreciation the explanation provided in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/62/138) concerning coordination \r\nbetween the Peacebuilding Fund and other bilateral and \r\nmultilateral funding mechanisms.  \r\n In a country like Sierra Leone, where the line \r\nbetween recovery and development is quite thin, it is \r\nnot always easy to convince the general public that the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund was not designed to reinforce \r\nexisting national development priorities, but rather was \r\nconceived as a flexible mechanism to respond to early \r\nor immediate challenges to the peace process.  \r\n It is true, as the Secretary-General observes in his \r\nreport, that the scope of the Peacebuilding Fund as an \r\nimmediate response mechanism did not fit as neatly in \r\na country like Sierra Leone that has evolved some \r\nyears beyond the highly fragile immediate post-conflict \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 18 \r\n \r\nenvironment. However, judging from the positive \r\nimpact that the Fund has had and is having on the \r\npeacebuilding efforts of the country, one can conclude \r\nthat the Fund has a catalytic role to play at various \r\nstages — and I emphasize, “various stages” — of a \r\ncountry’s peacebuilding process.  \r\n In Sierra Leone, the guns have been silent for \r\nover five years. We signed a Peace Agreement in 1999. \r\nThe country has enjoyed relative peace. Disarmament \r\nand demobilization have been completed. The country \r\nhas been, relatively speaking, at an advanced stage of \r\nits peacebuilding process. However, we faced serious \r\nchallenges that needed immediate attention. We are \r\ntherefore grateful that the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand the Peacebuilding Fund responded appropriately. \r\nWe hope that other countries, especially post-conflict \r\nleast developed countries at the same or similar stage \r\nof the peacebuilding process, may also benefit from the \r\nCommission and the Fund.  \r\n The report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(A/62/137) and the Secretary-General’s report on the \r\nfirst year of operation of the Peacebuilding Fund \r\n(A/62/138) constitute a volume in lessons learned. In \r\nother words, we have learned a lot during the past \r\n12 months from the responses of the Commission and \r\nthe Fund to the situations in Sierra Leone and Burundi.  \r\n However, looking ahead to the next phase of the \r\nCommission’s work, Sierra Leone would like the \r\nCommission to have an in-depth policy discussion as \r\nsoon as possible on the appropriate time for ending its \r\nengagement with a country. In other words, how long \r\nshould Sierra Leone remain on its agenda, taking into \r\naccount the Commission’s mandate to ensure that the \r\ncountry receives the continued attention of the \r\ninternational community?  \r\n There are several criteria for measuring the \r\nsuccess or effectiveness of this innovative \r\npeacebuilding mechanism over the past 12 months. \r\nSierra Leone reiterates that success should be measured \r\non the ground and against the impact that the activities \r\nof the Commission and the Fund have had, and will \r\nhave, on the lives of the people of Sierra Leone, in \r\nparticular young people, who continue to pose the \r\ngreatest challenge to the peacebuilding process.  \r\n Sierra Leone was a United Nations peacekeeping \r\nexperiment during its 11-year civil conflict. Today, in \r\nits post-conflict phase, Sierra Leone is again a guinea \r\npig for United Nations efforts in supporting the \r\npost-conflict recovery process through the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. We have benefited immeasurably from this role, \r\nand I am sure the laboratory results have helped, and \r\nare helping, the United Nations to redefine its \r\npeacebuilding objectives and strategies. Our plea to the \r\nUnited Nations and to all those that have contributed to \r\ntaking us to where we are today is to continue to help \r\nus to sustain the positive results we have yielded and \r\ncontinue to yield.  \r\n We believe the Peacebuilding Fund is a kind of \r\nemergency fund meant to close critical gaps in the \r\nrecovery process of countries emerging from conflict. \r\nIn other words, it is supposed to support national \r\nefforts to prevent relapse into conflict and lay a \r\nfoundation for development. With this understanding, \r\nit is advisable for the Commission to studiously \r\nminimize bureaucratic delays in its delivery \r\nmechanism.  \r\n We look forward with heightened hope and \r\nexpectation to consolidating the cooperation that has \r\nbeen established between the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and Sierra Leone. \r\n Mrs. Gallardo Hernández (El Salvador) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): I wish to congratulate the President on \r\nconvening this debate on the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/62/137) following its \r\nfirst session. We acknowledge the leadership of the \r\nPermanent Representative of Angola as former \r\nChairman of the Peacebuilding Commission. We also \r\nwelcome the Permanent Representative of Japan as \r\nnew Chairman of the Commission, and we reiterate our \r\nbest wishes for the success of his term. We would also \r\nlike to congratulate the Permanent Representatives of \r\nNorway and the Netherlands for their work as Chairs \r\nof the country-specific configurations on Burundi and \r\nSierra Leone respectively.  \r\n A little over a year has elapsed since the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission was established in the \r\ncontext of the reform process of the United Nations. \r\nThe expectations at that time were numerous and wide-\r\nranging. This was reflected in the initial dynamism of \r\nthe Commission as a new body. It involved \r\nconsultation among member States and the definition \r\nof functions by the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nsecretariat and the Peacebuilding Fund working group.  \r\n We recall that it was also necessary to engage in \r\nsome measure of strategic planning to ensure that we \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n19 07-53726 \r\n \r\nwere able to carry forward our work in a consistent \r\nmanner, including the establishment of clear \r\nmonitoring procedures and action to be taken on the \r\nground. Nonetheless, during this first year, we view the \r\nachievements with optimism, although we are well \r\naware of the numerous challenges facing the \r\nCommission.  \r\n The re-election of El Salvador as a Vice-Chair \r\nand its function as coordinator of the Working Group \r\non Lessons Learned demonstrate our commitment to \r\nthis effort.  \r\n Created to fill a gap in the United Nations system \r\nand to ease the transition from post-conflict \r\npeacekeeping processes to peacebuilding, the \r\nCommission, by its composition, adds value to present \r\nand future United Nations support to countries that \r\ndecide to lay down their arms and settle their disputes \r\nthrough dialogue and consultation — all with a view to \r\nforging their national development plans.  \r\n The presence of donor countries which over \r\nrecent years have contributed, in the form of economic, \r\ntechnical and financial cooperation, in various \r\ncountries in a post-conflict situation is paralleled by \r\nthe presence of countries like El Salvador which have \r\novercome internal violence themselves. We want to \r\ncontribute through our own experiences in helping to \r\nguide the decisions or recommendations that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission may adopt regarding the \r\ncountries under consideration, namely Sierra Leone \r\nand Burundi. Thus, the thing is to incorporate concrete \r\ninitiatives into a vision shared among the members of \r\nthe Commission. The first report submitted by the \r\nCommission at the end of its first year reflects some \r\nprogress and achievements, but it also indicates the \r\nwork that still remains to be done, particularly on the \r\nground.  \r\n Indeed, the concrete action of the Commission \r\nshould really be focused on the ground, because that is \r\nwhere the dividends of peace are really to be felt. In \r\nour view, the presence on the ground of members of the \r\nCommission through programmed visits is essential in \r\norder for the Commission to undertake an analysis and \r\ndefine strategies.  \r\n There is the challenge of stepping up \r\ncoordination with the Security Council, the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the General Assembly, and with \r\nthe other stakeholders on the ground, who are familiar \r\nwith the real situation, or with research centres that are \r\nworking on bolstering peacebuilding endeavours. \r\n El Salvador is of the view that we should also \r\npromote the formulation of concrete strategies, as we \r\nhave done in the cases of Sierra Leone and Burundi, \r\nthrough integrated peacebuilding strategies (IPBS), \r\nbecause that serves to bring added value and to avoid \r\nduplicating efforts. The international community \r\nexpects that the Commission will make a tangible \r\ncontribution, and why not say so? It should also make \r\nsome practical recommendations in specific areas or \r\ncontexts. With that in mind, the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned, which El Salvador is honoured to \r\nlead, has endeavoured to analyse and, through various \r\nprocesses, gather concrete experiences in order to \r\ncompile a set of lessons learned by the United Nations \r\nsystem working with the international community. \r\nWhen arms are laid down, it becomes necessary to \r\nlearn a new form of coexistence and join in a shared \r\nnational development project.  \r\n Although each peacebuilding process has its own \r\ncharacteristics, and its success depends, of course, on \r\nthe political determination of national actors, the \r\nimplementation of lessons learned must be of benefit to \r\nthe countries under consideration. We should not \r\nforget, therefore, the necessity of creating a historical \r\nrecord that will contribute in the future to helping the \r\nUnited Nations to become more effective in \r\npeacebuilding activities.  \r\n The modality adopted by the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned, which uses videoconferences to draw \r\ntogether the actors on the ground and the members of \r\nthe Commission, reflects the openness and flexibility \r\nthat must be present in our work.  \r\n Indeed, it is an open-ended group, in which all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations are welcome to \r\nparticipate and make their specific contribution so as to \r\nfurther the quest for lasting solutions on the ground in \r\nthe countries under consideration. \r\n On the basis of our experience, we feel that, when \r\nemerging from an armed conflict, it is essential to \r\nbring together a common will to set priorities in the \r\nshort- and medium-term and to act on the basis of these \r\npriorities. We should not forget that, at such times, \r\nthere are many needs, while national capacity is \r\nlimited. However, there are some aspects that, if not \r\ndealt with promptly, may re-emerge and jeopardize \r\nestablished political agreements among national actors, \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 20 \r\n \r\nincluding, to mention but a few, opportunities for \r\nreinsertion and jobs for former combatants and young \r\npeople and reform of the security sector. These are \r\nsubject areas that the Working Group on Lessons \r\nLearned has identified and analysed.  \r\n From the outset, El Salvador has expressed its \r\nfirm belief that the Peacebuilding Commission should \r\nnot be viewed as a body merely for financial \r\ncooperation, nor as a mediator between donors and \r\nrecipient countries. Also, we consider it important for \r\nthe members of the Commission to be familiar with the \r\nareas or programmes to be funded through the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. While it is important to hear the \r\nnational authorities and their assessment of their own \r\npriorities, still the way in which these funds are used \r\non the ground will be more successful if past \r\nexperiences are also brought to bear.  \r\n The reality of our world today shows that no \r\nregion is exempt from potential conflicts. Therefore, \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission should focus its \r\nattention on a geographical balance when considering \r\ncountries. The inclusion of a country or its withdrawal \r\nfrom the Peacebuilding Commission’s agenda should \r\nbe agreed with national authorities. In turn, the \r\nincorporation of new countries should take into \r\naccount the opinion of the members of the \r\nCommission. \r\n Lastly, may we thank the secretariat of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission for its support. Within the \r\nsecretariat there is a geographical balance that enriches \r\nthe Commission’s view with the input of the different \r\nregional realities. \r\n Mr. Soler Torrijos (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMay I begin by echoing the thanks of previous \r\nspeakers for the convening this meeting to consider the \r\nreport following the first year of work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. Secondly, my delegation would also like to \r\nextend its congratulations to the outgoing Chairman of \r\nthe Commission, the Permanent Representative of \r\nAngola, and welcome the new incoming Chairman, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Japan. We would also like \r\nto align ourselves with the statement by the delegation \r\nof Jamaica on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nwhich is part of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n As members of this new body and witnesses to \r\nthe progress that it has made, we welcome the outcome \r\nof its first year of work. We have seen how the \r\nCommission has proved its effectiveness in gathering \r\nfunding and to focus the attention of the world on the \r\ncountries on its agenda. We have also seen how it has \r\nplayed an important role as an intergovernmental \r\nobserver on governance issues in, for example, the \r\nelections in Sierra Leone on 11 August. We have also \r\nnoted its contributions to the coherence of the United \r\nNations system in this regard with the formulation of \r\nthe integrated peacebuilding strategies (IPBS). We \r\nhave also witnessed how it contributed to the \r\noperational definition of what peacebuilding really \r\nmeans within the United Nations.  \r\n In our view, during this second year, the \r\nCommission should focus its endeavours on tackling \r\nvarious concrete challenges, inter alia, defining its \r\nworking methods, for example, defining when the \r\nCommission should drop a country from the agenda; \r\nascertaining the possible contributions of civil society \r\nto the work of the Commission; maximizing the impact \r\non the ground in developing follow-up mechanisms to \r\nassess the peacebuilding strategies in those countries; \r\ndefining the operational relationship with other \r\npertinent United Nations bodies, regional organizations \r\nand subregional bodies; and defining where it can \r\nprovide added value to the work of other United \r\nNations bodies. In the case of the Security Council, for \r\ninstance, we feel that the Commission could play an \r\nadvisory role in cases requiring early warning. \r\nMoreover, we also feel it extremely important that the \r\nCommission consider including other countries on its \r\nagenda. That, too, would help strengthen its role as \r\ncoordinator of the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to build peace. \r\n In that respect, we feel that Guinea-Bissau’s \r\nrequest for inclusion in the Commission’s agenda, set \r\nout in its letter of 11 July, should be considered. We \r\nalso believe that it would be appropriate for the \r\nCommission and other United Nations bodies to study \r\nthe criteria for placing a country on the Commission’s \r\nagenda, which could serve as a reference point for the \r\ninternational community. We feel that the \r\nCommission’s agenda should maintain a regional \r\nbalance, pursuant to paragraph 12 of the resolution by \r\nwhich it was established. \r\n In conclusion, we believe that the Commission \r\nshould redouble its efforts at its second session to \r\nensure effective results on the ground and avoid any \r\nbacksliding that could occur not for a lack of will, but \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n21 07-53726 \r\n \r\nbecause of the need for well-defined working methods \r\nand criteria. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for organizing \r\ntoday’s debate on the report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. South Africa aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Jamaica on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n We also wish to thank the first Chairperson of the \r\nOrganizational Committee, Ambassador Gaspar \r\nMartins of Angola, and the chairs of the country-\r\nspecific configurations for a job well done under their \r\nleadership. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission is the result of \r\nthe collective will of Member States to create support \r\nmechanisms for countries recovering from the \r\ndevastation of conflicts. The work of the Commission \r\nand its dynamic approach are crucial if we are to \r\nsucceed in our efforts to prevent countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict from relapsing back into conflict. \r\nCertainly, those of us in the African continent viewed \r\nthe establishment of the Commission as an important \r\nstep in assisting and providing the necessary support to \r\nour sister countries in their post-conflict peacebuilding, \r\nreconciliation and development endeavours. \r\n The first annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission before us provides a detailed account of \r\nthe activities of the Commission during the past \r\n12 months. It reflects the collective role played by \r\nvarious members of the Commission and national \r\nGovernments, and the invaluable contribution made by \r\nother stakeholders, such as civil society and the \r\ninternational financial institutions. \r\n South Africa notes with satisfaction the \r\nCommission’s efforts to provide medium- and long-\r\nterm peace consolidation advice to countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict situations, as well as funding from the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund for peace consolidation projects. \r\nWith the cases of Sierra Leone and Burundi being \r\nexamined by the Peacebuilding Commission in their \r\ncountry-specific configurations, the Commission has \r\nproduced good results indeed. \r\n In its first year under the excellent leadership of \r\nAngola, the Commission was able to operate within a \r\nflexible framework in developing working \r\nrelationships with all its partners. In that context, the \r\nCommission has adopted provisional rules of \r\nprocedure, provisional guidelines on the participation \r\nof civil society, and country-specific formats to \r\nconsider the cases of Burundi and Sierra Leone, while \r\nprocesses to develop integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies have been launched.  \r\n It is important that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission continue to be driven by Member States. \r\nIn that context, the Organizational Committee must \r\ncontinue to be the focal point of all the Commission’s \r\nactivities, and its central role must be strengthened. \r\nWhile it is crucial to refine those relationships and the \r\ncriteria for identifying new areas of work, there is a \r\nsense of urgency for the Commission to go beyond \r\nprocedural concerns to perform its activities fully on \r\nthe ground. \r\n We believe that, in the year ahead under the able \r\nleadership of Japan, the Commission will need to work \r\ntowards more practical and concrete outcomes from its \r\nefforts to promote peace consolidation. The success of \r\nthe Commission will be judged by its ability to make a \r\nreal difference to the lives of people in Freetown, \r\nBujumbura and beyond. We believe that the ultimate \r\nsuccess of the Commission’s work lies in the \r\ntransformation of all its plans and policies into \r\nconcrete actions. The main challenge facing it is to \r\nmaximize its impact on the ground in full alignment, \r\ncooperation and accordance with the national \r\nGovernments’ policies and strategies. \r\n South Africa believes that peacebuilding should \r\nbe based on the principles of national ownership and \r\ninternational partnership. Quick-impact projects and \r\nthe sufficient injection of predictable resources in a \r\ncountry emerging from conflict are crucial to ensuring \r\nstability and development on the ground. For that \r\nreason, the invaluable support provided by the donor \r\ncommunity to the activities of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission needs to be consolidated and enhanced if \r\nwe are to succeed in achieving peace, security and \r\ndevelopment, in particular in the early post-conflict \r\nstages. \r\n On the issue of national ownership, we should \r\nmake sure that the countries emerging from conflict \r\nhave full ownership of peacebuilding for the benefit of \r\nall their people. In that regard, we believe that the \r\nconcerned countries must be allowed genuine national \r\nownership in identifying priorities for peacebuilding. \r\nIn addition, while there is no argument that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has an advisory role, it \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 22 \r\n \r\nshould be prepared to listen to the priorities, needs and \r\nviews of the countries under consideration. After all, \r\nthe primary clients of the Commission are the countries \r\nemerging from conflict. \r\n The Peacebuilding Fund was created for the \r\nspecific purpose of assisting in the facilitation of \r\npeacebuilding activities. In that context, the Fund was \r\nunderstood to be a catalyst for attracting much-needed \r\nofficial development assistance and resources, \r\nparticularly at a time when there may be little hope of \r\nsuccess towards recovery. It is for that reason that we \r\nhope that there will be clarity about the role of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. \r\n Finally, we concur with the view that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission needs to further strengthen \r\nits relationship with relevant organs and institutions, \r\nincluding the General Assembly, the Security Council, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, and regional and \r\nsubregional organizations. In our continent, the African \r\nUnion continues to play its role in the peacebuilding \r\nfield, including through the adoption of a post-conflict \r\nreconstruction and development policy. In that regard, \r\nwe hope that, in the year ahead, the Commission will \r\nstrengthen its cooperation with relevant bodies on the \r\nAfrican continent. Actors such as the African Union, \r\nthe regional economic communities and other agencies, \r\nsuch as the African Development Bank, have a key role \r\nto play in all peacebuilding efforts for countries \r\nemerging from conflict. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana): My delegation wishes to \r\ncommend Ambassador Gaspar Martins of Angola and \r\nhis dedicated team, ably supported by the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office led by Assistant \r\nSecretary-General Carolyn McAskie, for their \r\ncontribution and pioneering role in making the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission a reality today. We also \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Takasu of Japan on his \r\nelection as the new Chairman of the Organizational \r\nCommittee of the Commission, and wish to assure him \r\nof the continued support of Ghana, as a member and \r\nVice-Chair, in addressing the remaining challenges \r\nfacing the Commission, some of which have been \r\nhighlighted in its first annual report. \r\n My delegation would also like to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for submitting the first annual \r\nreport on the Peacebuilding Fund and to commend his \r\nefforts in the area of peacebuilding. \r\n We recall that the hybrid creation of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission as an intergovernmental \r\nadvisory body by concurrent resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council on 20 December \r\n2005 makes it a unique institutional mechanism and the \r\nfirst of its kind in the United Nations. The Commission \r\nand the Peacebuilding Fund, which is intended to be \r\nseparate and independent of the Commission, together \r\nconstitute two key pillars of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture within the United Nations system. \r\n Our debate should not lose sight of the ultimate \r\npurpose for which the Peacebuilding Commission was \r\ncreated, which is to mobilize international resources \r\nand coordinate the efforts of relevant actors both inside \r\nand outside the United Nations family in order to \r\nprevent the recurring cycle of violence in countries \r\nemerging from conflict, through the adoption of post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding strategies to ensure sustainable \r\npeace, recovery and development. That entails helping \r\nthe national or transitional Governments of war-torn or \r\nfragile States to rebuild institutions of democratic \r\ngovernance and accountability, to pursue security \r\nsector reform and reconciliation and to promote a \r\nculture of respect for the rule of law and human rights.  \r\n At the same time, the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nis supposed to play an advocacy and catalytic role in \r\ngalvanizing the international community to pay \r\nsustained attention to these countries in the medium to \r\nlong term, until national authorities have developed the \r\ncapacity to carry out peacebuilding processes on their \r\nown long after the external helpers have left. \r\n The various configurations of the meetings of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission provide a rare opportunity \r\nfor United Nations bodies to interface with the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions and other donors, with a view to \r\npreventing duplication of peacebuilding efforts. The \r\nCommission further provides a forum for the \r\nparticipation of civil society groups or non-governmental \r\norganizations, through whose grass-roots activism the \r\nprospects for the success of peacebuilding initiatives at \r\nthe local or community level are enhanced. \r\n The first annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (A/62/137) highlights some of the \r\nachievements of the Commission in its first year of \r\nexistence. Notwithstanding formidable difficulties \r\nencountered, members succeeded in putting in place \r\nthe structures necessary for that novel institution to \r\ntake off, albeit imperfectly. Given its relatively short \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n23 07-53726 \r\n \r\nlifespan, the Peacebuilding Commission remains, in \r\nmany respects, a work in progress. As highlighted in \r\nthe first annual report of the Commission, there remain \r\nmany challenges ahead. One year after it was created, a \r\nclear consensus on aspects of the Commission’s \r\nmandate, operational methods and relationship with \r\nother United Nations bodies and non-United Nations \r\nentities has yet to emerge. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission must be \r\nadequately resourced to strengthen its capacity to \r\naccept more countries on its agenda. That will also \r\nrequire further improvements in its working methods, \r\ntaking into account lessons learned in its first year of \r\noperation. Thus, those who qualify to be on the \r\nCommission’s agenda should be determined not by \r\nnumbers, geography or region, but by necessity, \r\nrelevance and reality. \r\n Credible reports received from the United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States and the \r\nInternational Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau, among \r\nother sources, confirm that the situation in \r\nGuinea-Bissau remains fragile. Ghana therefore \r\nsupports Guinea-Bissau’s pending request to the \r\nSecurity Council to be referred to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. We look forward to working together \r\nwith other members of the Security Council to achieve \r\nthe necessary consensus on Guinea-Bissau’s request.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, as well as all relevant actors, must \r\nmake greater efforts to mobilize the support of regional \r\norganizations. In the case of Africa, the African Union \r\nPolicy Framework on Post-conflict Reconstruction and \r\nDevelopment, which places emphasis on preventive \r\ndiplomacy through addressing the root causes of \r\nconflict — such as poverty, injustice and inequality and \r\nthe absence of the rule of law and good governance — \r\nshould be regarded as an important instrument for \r\ncooperation among the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and African countries to devise \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding strategies. Further \r\nclarification is desirable as to what the relationship \r\nshould be between the Commission and the Fund and \r\nbetween them and other United Nations bodies, such as \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n In conclusion, it is the hope and the expectation \r\nof my delegation that the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand the Peacebuilding Fund will succeed in mobilizing \r\nmore resources — financial, technical and otherwise — \r\nas well as in attracting the political will necessary to \r\nfacilitate their work to add value to peacebuilding \r\nefforts in countries in post-conflict situations, \r\nincluding Burundi and Sierra Leone. \r\n Mr. Steeghs (Netherlands): The Netherlands \r\naligns itself with the statement made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Portugal. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission was the missing \r\npiece in the United Nations jigsaw puzzle. It was \r\nintended to bridge the gap between immediate post-\r\nconflict efforts and long-term recovery and \r\ndevelopment. Bridging that gap is crucial to improving \r\nthe lot of the poorest on the planet — the bottom \r\nbillion, as Paul Collier calls them in his recent book by \r\nthe same title. Nearly three quarters of the people in \r\nthe bottom billion have recently been through — or are \r\nstill in the midst of — civil war. And half of all civil \r\nwars result from post-conflict relapse. \r\n Breaking the cycle of conflict so that the bottom \r\nbillion can break free from the prison of poverty is \r\nwhat the Peacebuilding Commission can contribute to. \r\nThat is a lot to live up to, but over the past year the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has clearly been building \r\nmomentum by building strategies and identifying \r\npriorities for Burundi and Sierra Leone. The reports \r\nbefore us today during this useful and valuable General \r\nAssembly debate (A/62/137 and A/62/138) lead us to \r\nthat conclusion. \r\n As a staunch supporter of both international order \r\nand international development, the Netherlands is \r\nproud to have played its role in getting this centrepiece \r\nof United Nations reform off the ground, and we are \r\nproud to continue to support it. As we speak, my \r\nAmbassador, Frank Majoor, Chair of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s Sierra Leone configuration, is on his \r\nsecond mission to that country. After the peaceful, \r\norderly and genuinely contested elections there, he \r\nseeks to expand the partnership between Sierra Leone \r\nand the international community, in particular the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n Mutual accountability must be at the heart of that \r\npartnership — in fact, of any partnership that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission fosters. That is why we \r\nbelieve it is so important that, in the short term, a \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 24 \r\n \r\nmonitoring and evaluation framework be integrated \r\ninto the integrated peacebuilding strategy for Burundi \r\nand, in the long term, into the strategy for Sierra \r\nLeone. I am referring to monitoring not in terms of \r\ntime-consuming number crunching, but in general \r\nterms, with a focus on potential peacebuilding gaps. \r\n At this point in time, we can safely state that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has gotten off the ground. \r\nUltimately, the Commission will have to be judged \r\naccording to results in countries in the field, not in \r\nNew York. For such results to materialize, the \r\nCommission must work to realize its potential as a \r\ncatalyst for in-country coordination. With the \r\nsuccessful country-specific meetings, we have already \r\nbeen laying the groundwork for just that. The \r\nCommission should not be an extra layer; it should not \r\nadd to the burden of bureaucracy facing already-\r\nstrained States. Rather, it should add value by standing \r\nat the operational and analytical centre of collective \r\nefforts to build peace — real peace, which is more than \r\nthe absence of war.  \r\n For that, we also need the enhanced support of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Support Office. And clearly, the \r\nCommission cannot do without the support of all the \r\nother international and national actors involved. \r\nTogether we can build that bridge — the bridge \r\nbetween immediate post-conflict efforts and long-term \r\nrecovery and development. This enterprise will now \r\nenter its second year, and we agree with the \r\nCommission’s priorities for the forthcoming \r\n12 months, especially the following ones: devising exit \r\nstrategies, coming up with modalities for civil society \r\ninvolvement and working out the details of a \r\nmonitoring mechanism for the integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies. Beyond that, we feel that the Commission \r\nshould also give more attention to quick wins, which \r\nare crucial to winning the peace. \r\n I started by saying that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission was the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle. \r\nAfter only one year, it would be unrealistic to think \r\nthat the new piece would in all respects fit entirely. \r\nAnd it does not fit entirely. There is still ample room \r\nfor improvement. But there is that good feeling — a \r\ngut feeling, I might say — that in the near future \r\neverything might just fall right into place if only we \r\nwork hard enough. And the Netherlands will. \r\n Mr. Ntakirutimana (Burundi) (spoke in French): \r\nAt the outset, I wish on behalf of my delegation to \r\nthank the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session for having convened this \r\nimportant meeting on the report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (A/62/137) and of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the Peacebuilding Fund \r\n(A/62/138). My delegation would also like to \r\ncommend the work of the Organizational Committee \r\nunder the chairmanship of Angola and the \r\nvice-chairmanship of El Salvador, and warmly to \r\nwelcome Japan as the new Chair of the Committee. \r\n In addition, my delegation offers deserved thanks \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Johan Løvald, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Norway, for the leadership that he \r\nrepeatedly demonstrated both during the country-\r\nspecific meetings on Burundi and during meetings of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. I also wish to sincerely \r\nthank Ms. Carolyn McAskie and her team for their \r\nconsiderable support to the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n My delegation fully endorses the statement made \r\nby the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM), but would like to \r\nmake several additional comments.  \r\n Since the establishment of democratically elected \r\ninstitutions, Burundi has made considerable progress in \r\nterms of peacebuilding, in particular with the signing \r\nin September 2006 of a comprehensive ceasefire \r\nagreement with the last rebel movement, the \r\nPALIPEHUTU-Forces nationales de libération (FNL). \r\nIn that regard, my delegation duly appreciates the \r\nefforts of the South African facilitation and welcomes \r\nthe regional peace initiative as well as the support \r\nprovided to my country by the United Nations, the \r\nAfrican Union and the international community in \r\ngeneral. \r\n In selecting Burundi as the first country to benefit \r\nfrom the Peacebuilding Fund, the members of the \r\nCommission demonstrated their commitment to \r\nBurundi in its search for strategies and methods to \r\nenable it to build sustainable peace and to revive a \r\nnational economy that can generate sustainable and \r\nbeneficial development. \r\n The Government of Burundi appreciates the \r\nefforts undertaken by the Commission and welcomes \r\nits first report. First and foremost, it raised the \r\ninternational community’s awareness of the urgent \r\nneed for community recovery in Burundi by \r\nparticipating in the development partners round table \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n25 07-53726 \r\n \r\nthat took place on 24 and 25 May. We are particularly \r\npleased that the round table was successful. My \r\ndelegation counts on the Commission to ensure that \r\npartners and donors meet their commitments.  \r\n Secondly, the Commission held several country-\r\nspecific meetings on Burundi here in New York, which \r\nprovided an opportunity to think about the concept of \r\ngood political and administrative governance in \r\nBurundi. Similar work was done to identify the key \r\npriorities for peacebuilding and for reducing the risk of \r\na relapse into conflict and, of direct interest to us, to \r\ndefine and adopt the strategic peacebuilding \r\nframework. \r\n Today the Burundi Government, working with all \r\nstakeholders nationally and with the support of the \r\nCommission, is exploring the establishment of a \r\nfollow-up mechanism. Work is moving ahead properly \r\nin that area.  \r\n As the two reports before us today demonstrate, \r\n2006 saw the inception and operational launching of \r\nthe Commission and of the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice, under the committed leadership of Ms. Carolyn \r\nMcAskie. This preliminary work was essential for its \r\nfirst year of experience in the process of peacebuilding \r\nin post-conflict countries. While welcoming the work \r\nalready done, we must underscore that much remains to \r\nbe done, in particular with respect to the \r\nimplementation of the strategic framework and the \r\nfollow-up mechanism.  \r\n My delegation continues to believe that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission will carry out its mission \r\nsuccessfully as it supports my country in its efforts to \r\nbuild lasting peace. With the Commission, a glimmer \r\nof hope has been born in the hearts of Burundians. And \r\nwith the Commission, calm and assurance will be the \r\nhallmark of the implementation of our programmes. \r\n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand as a beneficiary country, my delegation would like \r\nto make a few comments about the future activities of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. First, the principle of \r\nnational ownership must always be the cornerstone of \r\nthe Commission’s activities. Secondly, the Commission \r\nshould differentiate itself from other United Nations \r\nsubsidiary bodies by adopting innovative measures \r\nwith regard to transparency, compromise, consensus-\r\nbuilding and flexibility. Thirdly, the Commission \r\nshould continue to work closely with the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the international financial \r\ninstitutions. \r\n I wish to conclude my statement by reiterating \r\nonce again Burundi’s commitment to success and thus \r\nto becoming a source of pride for the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and for the United Nations.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on the observer of the Observer State of the Holy \r\nSee.  \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): At the very \r\noutset, my delegation wishes to express appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Ismael Gaspar Martins, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Angola, for his able chairmanship \r\nduring the inaugural year of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. I wish also to express best wishes to \r\nAmbassador Yukio Takasu, Permanent Representative \r\nof Japan, as he assumes the chairmanship of the \r\nCommission. \r\n My delegation believes that the best guarantee \r\nagainst conflict is the individual and collective \r\nenjoyment of durable peace. To achieve that in a post-\r\nconflict country, it is necessary to recognize the special \r\nneeds of that country so that it can be assisted \r\naccordingly in laying the foundations of sustainable \r\npeace.  \r\n The Holy See therefore warmly welcomed the \r\ncreation of the Peacebuilding Commission as a \r\nresponse to the need for greater coherence and \r\ncoordination of international peacebuilding efforts in \r\npost-conflict situations. The Commission’s success will \r\nbe measured on the ground, based on whether or not it \r\nmakes a difference to communities and countries with \r\nwhich it works. Expectations of what it can deliver in \r\ncountries emerging from armed conflicts continue to \r\nclimb. This is especially true in Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone. There, the Peacebuilding Commission is \r\nentering uncharted areas of action, but the \r\nCommission’s emphasis on strong national ownership \r\nand responsibility gives us reason to hope for success \r\nin those first two focus countries, as well as in other \r\npost-conflict States that will be considered in the \r\nfuture. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission debates and \r\ndocuments suggest that one of the main challenges \r\nfacing it is to prove that it is not a superfluous \r\nsuperstructure cast over the various stakeholders and \r\nactors already working on the ground. Rather, it is \r\nA/62/PV.24  \r\n \r\n07-53726 26 \r\n \r\nmeant to bring added value to the overall effort of \r\nhelping post-conflict States and societies successfully \r\nmanage the difficult transition from war to sustainable \r\npeace and development. The task is made even more \r\ndaunting by the fact that post-conflict situations pose \r\nmultiple and particularly complex problems, all \r\ncompeting for immediate attention. To enable the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to respond adequately to \r\nthis, the international community is equally challenged \r\nto equip it with the necessary mandate and resources. \r\n I wish to commend the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned for its efforts in accumulating best \r\npractices and lessons on critical peacebuilding issues, \r\nthus helping the Peacebuilding Commission make \r\ndecisions more swiftly while avoiding the repetition of \r\npast mistakes. \r\n The Holy See was pleased with the approval of \r\nguidelines for civil society participation in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Such participation would \r\nbe decisive on the ground where, among other \r\nstakeholders, faith-based organizations are fully \r\nengaged in human development and are at the forefront \r\nin fostering dialogue, in peacemaking and in \r\npost-conflict reconciliation. \r\n My delegation is aware of the continuing debates \r\non what the Peacebuilding Commission should be, on \r\nits relation to peacekeeping operations and on its \r\nprocedures and methods. While this is part of the \r\nCommission’s growth process, these debates should not \r\ndistract or derail it from its mandate of making a \r\ndifference in the lives of peoples and countries, lest it \r\nbecome just another forum for debate. \r\n My delegation is pleased to assure the Assembly \r\nof its continuing interest in the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and to encourage the \r\nCommission in the pursuit of its challenging task of \r\nhelping rebuild individual lives and entire countries \r\nravaged by war. It will have fully achieved this task \r\nwhen development, peace and security and human \r\nrights are finally interlinked and mutually reinforcing \r\nin countries which have known the devastation of \r\narmed conflict. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 57/32 of 19 November \r\n2002, I now give the floor to the observer of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Mr. Motter (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I am \r\npleased to have been given this opportunity to address \r\nthe General Assembly on agenda item 10 as it relates to \r\nthe first annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (A/62/137). As we all know, peace will \r\nnever be fully achieved without good governance, and \r\nparliaments, which are among the institutions at the \r\nheart of governance, play a key role in the \r\npeacebuilding process. \r\n During the Peacebuilding Commission’s first year \r\nof operations, the country-specific meetings on \r\nBurundi identified a number of critical priorities for \r\npeace consolidation and for reducing the country’s risk \r\nof relapsing into conflict. We are pleased to see that \r\naction to improve governance and democracy was at \r\nthe core of those priorities. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission report recommends, among other things, \r\npromoting the capacity of the parliament to enact and \r\nrevise national legislation and to ensure its compliance \r\nwith international human rights standards. \r\n We have striven to support the efforts of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in Burundi and in Sierra \r\nLeone. In Burundi, we have worked with the \r\nparliament to build its lawmaking and oversight \r\ncapacities. With United Nations Democracy Fund \r\nsupport, we have begun implementing activities aimed \r\nat enhancing the capacities of women parliamentarians, \r\nincluding initiatives aimed at bringing women \r\nparliamentarians from all political parties together to \r\nwork for the promotion of women’s rights.  \r\n Above all, we have engaged the leadership of the \r\nparliament in an initiative to promote dialogue in a bid \r\nto ensure that decision-making is as inclusive as \r\npossible. Indeed, we cannot overemphasize the \r\nimportance of parliament as the crucible of national \r\nreconciliation in its role of mediating between the \r\ndivergent interests of society, especially against the \r\nimmediate post-conflict background of Burundi. \r\n What I have just said regarding Burundi holds \r\ntrue for Sierra Leone. We are anxious to ensure that its \r\nparliament figures high on the peacebuilding agenda of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the international \r\ncommunity at large. We owe it to the people of Sierra \r\nLeone to ensure that the fragile peace process does not \r\ncome unravelled. We should ensure that the \r\nrepresentatives of the people rise above parochial \r\ninterests in favour of the general interest. The \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), as the world \r\n A/62/PV.24\r\n \r\n27 07-53726 \r\n \r\norganization of national parliaments, stands ready to \r\ncontinue to support efforts to develop parliaments that \r\nare representative, transparent, accessible, accountable \r\nand effective. \r\n In the light of that, the IPU is sending a mission \r\nto Sierra Leone to review the functioning of its \r\nparliament and assist parliamentary authorities in \r\nidentifying specific needs with a view to developing a \r\ncomprehensive project of assistance to strengthen the \r\ncapacity of the parliament to perform its lawmaking, \r\noversight and representational roles more efficiently. \r\nWe are doing this, I am pleased to add, in cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations. \r\n It is our fervent hope that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will extend its hand to other post-conflict \r\ncountries. In that regard, we are pleased with the recent \r\ndecision to include Liberia among countries eligible for \r\nsupport under the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n During the Peacebuilding Commission’s first year \r\nof work, the Commission has covered many areas \r\naimed at bringing more coherence to peacebuilding \r\nefforts where democratically elected parliaments have \r\nbeen placed high among the priorities of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 3369 (XXX) of 10 October \r\n1975, I now give the floor to the observer of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. \r\n Mr. Wahab (Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference): My delegation would like to express \r\nsincere appreciation for the excellent beginning that \r\nhas been made by the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nunder the leadership of Ambassador Gaspar Martins \r\nand his team. We welcome Ambassador Takasu as the \r\nnew Chairman of the Commission and assure him and \r\nhis team of our full support and cooperation. We also \r\ncongratulate the Peacebuilding Support Office, headed \r\nby Assistant Secretary-General McAskie, for its \r\nexcellent work doing the first year of the \r\nCommission’s work. \r\n We welcome the report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, contained in document A/62/137. Indeed, \r\nit gives my delegation great pleasure to see this first-\r\never annual report, which is objective, informative and \r\ncoherent in its content and timely in its need. My \r\ndelegation concurs with the report’s assertion that the \r\n \r\n main challenge now facing the Commission is to \r\nmaximize its impact on the ground to make the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture an effective \r\ninstrument of international collaboration in support of \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. \r\n We also welcome the Secretary-General’s report \r\non the Peacebuilding Fund, contained in document \r\nA/62/138. While it appears that contributions to the \r\nFund are gradually flowing in, we feel that greater \r\neffort needs to be exerted in order for Fund initiatives \r\nto realize their maximum desired effect. \r\n The OIC continues to remain engaged in major \r\ninitiatives directed at Sierra Leone. The latest meeting \r\nof the OIC Contact Group on Sierra Leone was held \r\ntwo weeks ago here at the United Nations. The \r\nresulting deliberations and decisions taken ensure that \r\nthe OIC will remain committed to all pertinent \r\ninitiatives targeting that country. \r\n In terms of broader engagement with the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the determination of the \r\nOIC to remain committed to its endeavours is reflected \r\nin the final communiqué of the annual coordination \r\nmeeting of the ministers of foreign affairs of the States \r\nmembers of the OIC, which was held here in New York \r\non 2 October 2007. \r\n The ministers of the OIC countries unequivocally \r\nappreciated the Peacebuilding Commission’s important \r\ncontributions during its first year, as well as the active \r\nand constructive participation of the OIC member \r\nStates that are members of the Commission. They \r\nwelcomed the invitation to the OIC to participate in the \r\nCommission’s meetings and supported its continued \r\nengagement in that regard. Finally, they requested OIC \r\nmember States to consider providing financial \r\ncontributions to the OIC Secretary-General such that \r\nthey may be transferred as the OIC’s contribution to \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n Lastly, we wish the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nthe very best as it continues in its endeavour to achieve \r\nits noble objectives. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate. The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 10 and 110. \r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m. \r\n"
