Corrections should be submitted to the original \r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature \r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room \r\nC-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. \r\n07-54249 (E) \r\n*0754249* \r\nPresident: Mr. Kerim . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. İlkin (Turkey), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 132 (continued) \r\n \r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/62/478) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: If there is no proposal \r\nunder rule 66 of the rules of procedure, may I take it \r\nthat the General Assembly decides not to discuss the \r\nreport of the Fifth Committee that is before the \r\nAssembly today? \r\n  It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: Statements will therefore \r\nbe limited to explanations of vote. \r\n The positions of delegations regarding the \r\nrecommendation of the Fifth Committee have been \r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the \r\nrelevant official records. \r\n May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that,  \r\n  “When the same draft resolution is \r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary \r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, \r\nexplain its vote only once, i.e., either in the \r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting, unless that \r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different \r\nfrom its vote in the Committee.” \r\n May I remind delegations that, also in accordance \r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations \r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes. \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take a decision in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on the \r\ndraft resolution, recommended by the Fifth Committee \r\nin paragraph 6 of its report. The Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution, entitled “Scale of assessments for \r\nthe apportionment of the expenses of the United \r\nNations: requests under Article 19 of the Charter”, \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\n  The draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n62/1). \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n132. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 74 and 75 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and \r\nOther Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of \r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for \r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in \r\nthe Territory of Neighbouring States between \r\n1 January and 31 December 1994 \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 2 \r\n \r\n Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the \r\n twelfth annual report of the International \r\n Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (A/62/284) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991 \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the \r\n fourteenth annual report of the International \r\n Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (A/62/172) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly takes note of the twelfth annual report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?  \r\n  It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly takes note of the fourteenth annual report of \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Mr. Dennis \r\nByron, President of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda. \r\n Mr. Byron: I am greatly honoured to address the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly. Today, as President \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR), I am presenting the twelfth annual report of \r\nthe Tribunal of its activities from 1 July 2006 to \r\n30 June 2007 (see A/62/284).  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to extend my \r\nmost sincere congratulations to President Kerim on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly.  \r\n The report demonstrates that the Tribunal’s Trial \r\nChambers continued to vigorously work at full \r\ncapacity. They rendered judgements involving five \r\naccused and more than 250 interlocutory and pretrial \r\ndecisions. Trials involving five other accused have \r\nbeen completed and await judgement. In addition, trials \r\ninvolving 22 accused are in progress. According to our \r\nprojections, judgements concerning five of them will \r\nbe delivered early next year. As of today, the cases of \r\nthe six remaining detainees are at the pretrial stage. \r\nThey will be ready to commence in early 2008, as soon \r\nas Trial Chamber and courtroom capacity permits. \r\n The Appeals Chamber heard and disposed of an \r\nincreased number of cases between July 2006 and June \r\n2007. Judgements on appeal were delivered concerning \r\nsix individuals, bringing the total number of persons \r\nwhose appeals are completed to 19. During the \r\nreporting period, over 100 interlocutory decisions and \r\npretrial orders and decisions were delivered. Four \r\naccused have pending appeals. As a result of the \r\n10 anticipated judgements to be delivered by early next \r\nyear, the workload of the Appeals Chamber will \r\nprogressively and substantially increase. \r\n The efforts of the Prosecutor, Mr. Hassan Jallow, \r\ncontinued to be focused on securing the arrest of the \r\naccused still at large, notably Félicien Kabuga. The \r\nthree organs of the Tribunal have been constantly \r\nsensitizing the international community on the \r\nimportance of this issue. The Prosecutor, in particular, \r\nhas conducted diplomatic missions to several States \r\nand has deployed investigators to track the fugitives. \r\nFollowing a report submitted by the three principals of \r\nthe Tribunal, INTERPOL’s 19th African Regional \r\nConference passed, in July 2007, a resolution calling \r\non all National Central Bureaus to provide assistance \r\nin arresting the remaining fugitives. By October 2007, \r\nthree of them had been arrested in coordination with \r\nINTERPOL. On behalf of the Tribunal, I would like to \r\nthank INTERPOL and the national law enforcement \r\nagencies of the countries in which the fugitives were \r\narrested for their efforts. \r\n During the reporting period, the Registry, headed \r\nby Mr. Adama Dieng, continued to play a crucial role \r\nin the work of the Tribunal by providing administrative \r\nand judicial support to all its trials. The continuous \r\ndiplomatic efforts of the Office of the Registrar led to \r\nsuccessful cooperation and assistance of Members \r\nStates with the Tribunal, including the relocation of \r\nacquitted persons. Moreover, the Registry worked \r\nsuccessfully to enhance the public image of and \r\ninterest in the work of the Tribunal by carrying out a \r\ndiverse range of public relations activities in Rwanda. \r\nThe Outreach Programme also greatly contributed to \r\ncapacity-building in Rwanda by organizing visits to the \r\nseat of the Tribunal and training sessions and by \r\nproducing documentaries and other publications. \r\n I assure the Assembly that all sections of the \r\nTribunal are coordinating their efforts to achieve its \r\nmandate and to complete its work at the earliest date \r\npossible. \r\n In addition, the Tribunal continues to coordinate \r\nits efforts with those of the International Criminal \r\n A/62/PV.25\r\n \r\n3 07-54249 \r\n \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the United \r\nNations Office of Legal Affairs in addressing the \r\nresidual mechanisms that are needed to achieve its \r\nwork and promote its legacy. \r\n However, the continued assistance and \r\ncooperation of Member States is paramount for the \r\nsuccessful accomplishment of our vital mission. It is \r\ncritical for securing the arrest of the 15 accused still at \r\nlarge. The nations represented here today must \r\nrecognize the risks posed to achieving international \r\njustice if they remain fugitives. It is clear that the \r\nTribunal’s mandate, as defined by the Security Council, \r\nmay require that some of the remaining fugitives be \r\nconsidered as candidates for trial at the Tribunal itself. \r\nThe date of their arrest and transfer to the Tribunal may \r\nimpact on the ability of the Tribunal to effect a timely \r\ncompletion of all trials at first instance. The referral of \r\ncases, the serving of sentences for convicted persons, \r\nthe relocation of acquitted persons and convicted \r\npersons who have served their sentences are all issues \r\nthat require the assistance of Member States and need \r\nto be urgently addressed as the Tribunal moves \r\nforward. Currently there are six pending referral cases \r\nbefore the Tribunal. \r\n Strengthening the Rwandan judicial capacity is a \r\nkey component of the Tribunal’s mandate to bring \r\nabout justice, stability and reconciliation in the region. \r\nAs fully described in the annual report, the Tribunal \r\nprovides support in Rwanda to the judicial sector, civil \r\nsociety and academic institutions through its capacity-\r\nbuilding and the Outreach Programme.  \r\n These and many other activities were made \r\npossible by the gracious financial assistance of the \r\nEuropean Commission and the Tribunal’s Voluntary \r\nTrust Fund, established in response to resolution \r\n49/251 of 20 July 1995 to support essential work \r\nprogrammes that are not adequately funded by the \r\nassessed budget. I invite Member States to replenish \r\nthe Fund and sustain these projects, which defend the \r\nTribunal’s legacy and meet the completion milestones \r\nset out by the Security Council. \r\n The successful completion of trials will be \r\nrealized thanks to the highly dedicated work of \r\nTribunal staff. However, I should emphasize the fact \r\nthat the Registry continues to be faced with challenges \r\nrelated to the retention of staff. Staff departures are on \r\nthe rise. Unless something is done to slow this trend, \r\nthere is the likelihood that this could negatively impact \r\non the completion strategy. The vacancy rate is \r\ncontinuously increasing. By the end of September \r\n2007, it had reached 20 percent for professional staff \r\nand above, as staff members continue to leave the \r\nTribunal for more stable jobs. This situation is \r\naggravated by the difficulties in recruiting new staff as \r\nthe Tribunal moves closer to completion. The Tribunal \r\ncalls upon Member States to come up with a \r\nmechanism that addresses their concern in order to \r\nensure that adequate resources are made available to \r\nthe Tribunal for the successful and timely completion \r\nof its work. \r\n The twelfth annual report shows that a high level \r\nof performance has been achieved and that the \r\nworkload of the Tribunal is under control. It also \r\ndemonstrates the Tribunal’s unwavering commitment \r\nto its mandate to bring about justice and reconciliation \r\nin Rwanda and in the region, while upholding due \r\nprocess. \r\n At this juncture, I would like to pay special \r\ntribute to all judges of the Tribunal, with special \r\nemphasis on the ad litem judges, who have continued \r\nto contribute greatly to the Tribunal’s achievements.  \r\n Since the beginning of its trial proceedings, in \r\nJanuary 1997, the Tribunal has arrested 75 individuals \r\nout of the 90 indicted persons, including the former \r\nPrime Minister, Jean Kambanda, and 14 other members \r\nof his interim Government of Rwanda, as well as many \r\nsenior political and military leaders, journalists, \r\nintellectuals, religious and youth leaders and \r\nbusinessmen. Judgements against 33 of those \r\nindividuals have been delivered in first instance: \r\n28 were sentenced to prison terms ranging from five \r\nyears to life, while 5 persons were acquitted. During \r\nthe next 15 months, the Tribunal will be moving to the \r\nrapid completion of the trials of the remaining \r\n42 persons who have already been arrested and to the \r\narrest and trial of some or all of the 15 fugitives. But I \r\nam sure that all members will agree with me that \r\n15 months constitutes a daunting challenge. \r\n I must recall that, in the founding resolution of \r\nthe ICTR (Security Council resolution 955 (1994)), the \r\nSecurity Council explained that the motive for setting \r\nup the Tribunal was to bring peace to the Great Lakes \r\nregion and to deter the concept of impunity for mass \r\natrocity. It is significant that for those political \r\npurposes, a judicial institution was established. At first \r\nglance, the Tribunal might be judged as a success or a \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 4 \r\n \r\nfailure by certain political criteria. But there are legal \r\ncriteria by which it must be judged as a court. It will be \r\nheld to have succeeded or failed by the credibility and \r\nfairness of its trial process. More important, I submit \r\nthat the explicit political purpose in its creation may \r\nbest be served by its success as a court and by the \r\nfairness of its process.  \r\n While the Tribunal has introduced measures to \r\nspeed up trials, it is critically important to ensure that \r\nessential fair-trial rights are not prejudiced, so that no \r\nreasonable onlooker will be able to regard the process \r\nor the end result as unfair. Nonetheless, the political \r\nimpact of the Tribunal’s work has already extended \r\nbeyond the number of persons prosecuted and \r\njudgements rendered. Through the trial proceedings \r\nand judgements, it has established an essential record \r\nof the grave violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw committed in Rwanda in 1994. It has built an \r\nimpressive and unprecedented body of jurisprudence of \r\nboth substantive international criminal law and \r\nprocedure. Its leading decisions and judgements are \r\nalready providing essential guidance for national and \r\ninternational courts designed to enforce international \r\nhumanitarian law, such as the Special Court for Sierra \r\nLeone or the International Criminal Court. It has \r\ninfluenced and will continue to influence legal and \r\nconstitutional reforms in Rwanda and the Great Lakes \r\nregion. \r\n One of the fundamental and lasting contributions \r\nof the Tribunal is the bringing of justice to the peoples \r\nof Rwanda and the Great Lakes region. Justice is an \r\nessential element of peace and reconciliation. There \r\nwill be no lasting peace if there is no credible \r\ninternational justice perspective that unites, on a higher \r\nlevel, the peoples of Rwanda and the Great Lakes \r\nregion, who have suffered from the heinous crimes \r\ncommitted in 1994. That is still as true today as it was \r\n12 years ago, when the late Judge Laity Kama \r\npresented the first annual report of the Tribunal to this \r\nbody, in which he stressed, “If justice is not done, there \r\nmay be no end to hatred” (A/51/PV.78, p. 5). \r\n I want to take this opportunity to thank the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly for their dedicated \r\nsupport for the Tribunal over the years. That support \r\nhas been instrumental in furthering the common \r\npractice worldwide of fighting against the impunity of \r\nthose responsible for war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and genocide. \r\n I stand before the Assembly to reiterate our \r\nunwavering commitment to the mandate given to the \r\nTribunal, to the implementation of its completion \r\nstrategy and to bringing to justice those persons who \r\nwere most responsible for the genocide and the \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda \r\nin 1994. Our work will not be completed until we \r\nestablish the guilt or innocence of the accused, bring \r\njustice to victims of the massive crimes that were \r\ncommitted and establish a record of facts that can aid \r\nreconciliation in Rwanda. I respectfully request the \r\ncontinued assistance of all Member States as we pursue \r\nour commitment to completing the trials and to \r\nguaranteeing the triumph of international justice and \r\nthe fight against impunity. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Judge \r\nFausto Pocar, President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.  \r\n Mr. Pocar: I am honoured to appear before \r\nmembers today for the second time as President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia, to present to the General Assembly the \r\nfourteenth annual report of the Tribunal (see \r\nA/62/172). \r\n Before I begin my address, I would like to \r\ncongratulate President Kerim on his recent election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. Let me also express \r\nmy deep gratitude to the members of the Assembly for \r\nthe crucial support that they have given the Tribunal \r\nsince its inception. I wish to acknowledge that without \r\nthat support, the International Tribunal would not \r\nrepresent, as it does today, a beacon in the development \r\nand enforcement of international justice and a \r\nmechanism for advancing the rule of law in the region \r\nof the former Yugoslavia. \r\n In my address today, I would like to consider for \r\na moment the impact of the work of the Tribunal on \r\nwhat was, at the time of its establishment, an as yet \r\nuntested belief in the idea that international criminal \r\nlaw was not only enforceable but capable of \r\ncontributing to the restoration of international peace \r\nand security. When, in the wake of reports of untold \r\natrocities arising from the conflict in the former \r\nYugoslavia, the Security Council determined in its \r\nwisdom to create an international criminal tribunal, it \r\ndid so without precedent and with little real assurance \r\nof whether such an international tribunal could \r\nsucceed.  \r\n A/62/PV.25\r\n \r\n5 07-54249 \r\n \r\n The Tribunal has not only demonstrated that \r\ninternational criminal law is, in fact, an enforceable \r\nbody of law, but has also acted as a catalyst for the \r\nproliferation of other ad hoc international or mixed \r\ntribunals administering international criminal justice, \r\nin relation to Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, East \r\nTimor, Lebanon and, of course, for the establishment \r\nof the permanent International Criminal Court. The \r\ninfluence of the Tribunal’s achievements on the \r\ndecision to establish these other bodies and the \r\nimportance of its substantive and procedural \r\njurisprudence to the success of these institutions has \r\nbeen profound. At the more practical level, the \r\nInternational Tribunal has also supported these \r\ninstitutions through loans and transfers of our \r\nexperienced staff and through training workshops. The \r\nmessage proclaimed by the Tribunal and now by all of \r\nthe successor institutions is clear — there will be no \r\nimpunity where there is international will. \r\n In reporting on the progress of the Tribunal, I \r\nmust draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that \r\nthe International Tribunal is also an example in terms \r\nof efficiency. By way of illustration, the most current \r\nfigures show that the Tribunal has indicted a total of \r\n161 accused persons, with trial and appeal proceedings \r\ncompleted to date against 109 of those persons, if one \r\nalso considers the appeal judgment to be delivered \r\ntomorrow in the Halilović case. Currently, proceedings \r\nin seven cases concerning eight persons are pending on \r\nappeal. Additionally, appeals in a case concerning three \r\npersons are expected. Further, 25 accused in seven \r\ncases are in trial proceedings. Only 12 accused are \r\nawaiting trial and, unfortunately, four fugitives remain \r\nat large. In fact, taking into account that most cases are \r\nheard at both first instance and on appeal, the \r\nInternational Tribunal has issued more than three times \r\nthe number of judicial decisions than all the other \r\ninternational criminal courts and tribunals taken \r\ntogether. In other words, the efficiency of the Tribunal \r\nremains unparalleled today.  \r\n Currently, the International Tribunal is operating \r\nat unprecedented speed, with seven trials running \r\nsimultaneously in its three courtrooms. To conduct \r\nthese trials, a number of Tribunal’s ad litem judges sit \r\non two cases simultaneously, either as full judges or as \r\nreserve judges. Accordingly, many judges sit from \r\nearly in the morning into the evening. In addition, \r\nseveral of the permanent judges are preparing for new \r\ntrials while finishing judgement in another case and, \r\nwhere possible, starting new trials while working on an \r\noutstanding judgement. All of the International \r\nTribunal’s trial judges, permanent and ad litem, are \r\nworking at maximum capacity.  \r\n Likewise, the appeals judges have had an \r\nexceptionally productive year, rendering a record \r\n11 judgments, both in International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) cases, including \r\nseven judgments in the last six months. That is in \r\naddition to hundreds of interlocutory decisions, over \r\ndecisions on review and reconsideration, and two \r\ncontempt decisions issued.  \r\n As President of the International Tribunal, I have \r\nbeen heartened by the commitment and dedication \r\nshown by all of the judges of the Tribunal to meeting \r\nthe objectives of the completion strategy without \r\nsacrificing due process and to retaining the crucial \r\nsupport of the international community. I am confident \r\nthat the General Assembly will share my appreciation.  \r\n In addition to the judgements it issues, the \r\nTribunal has remained focused on ensuring that the \r\ncountries on whose soil the conflicts were fought are \r\nbenefiting as much as possible from its work. Indeed, \r\nthrough its ability to refer the cases of mid- to low-\r\nlevel accused to the courts of the region, pursuant to \r\nrule 11 bis of its rules of procedure and evidence, the \r\nInternational Tribunal is helping to establish those \r\ncourts as the national leaders in the domestic \r\nprosecution of war crimes cases.  \r\n As part of their commitment to ensuring that the \r\ncourts of the region have the capacity to prosecute war \r\ncrimes cases in accordance with international \r\nstandards, the judges of the International Tribunal have \r\nwelcomed members of courts of the region to the \r\nInternational Tribunal on several occasions to \r\nparticipate in round table discussions and workshops \r\nand have also travelled to the region themselves to \r\nparticipate in local conferences, where they have been \r\nable to share their experiences and exchange expertise \r\non a range of subjects.  \r\n Such meetings have led to a growing partnership \r\nbetween judges of the International Tribunal and \r\njudges of the domestic courts and in that spirit the \r\nInternational Tribunal recently amended its rules of \r\nprocedure and evidence to allow local judicial \r\nauthorities to directly petition the Tribunal’s judges for \r\naccess to protected information held by the Tribunal \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 6 \r\n \r\nand relevant to local proceedings. The importance of \r\nopening up the materials of the International Tribunal \r\nto those courts is critical to preserving the legacy of the \r\nTribunal through their continued prosecution of war \r\ncrimes cases.  \r\n In addition, the Prosecutor has developed parallel \r\ncooperative relationships with prosecutors of the \r\nregion through training sessions, conferences and \r\nseminars aimed at furthering the rule of law. The \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor has also been instrumental in \r\nproviding relevant materials to the authorities in the \r\nregion and in granting direct access to its electronic \r\ndatabases, where appropriate, to facilitate the \r\nprosecution by local prosecutors of alleged war \r\ncriminals not indicted by the International Tribunal.  \r\n While the judges and the Prosecutor have worked \r\nwith the relevant judicial and prosecutorial authorities, \r\nthe Registry has, through the Tribunal’s outreach \r\nprogramme, also continued its outreach efforts towards \r\nlocal populations to disseminate awareness of the work \r\nof the Tribunal and provide information and access to \r\nits judgements and decisions. This work has been \r\ninstrumental in gaining the support of people from the \r\nregion for the work of the Tribunal and in furthering \r\ndomestic prosecution of war crimes cases.  \r\n As the International Tribunal comes closer to \r\ncompleting its mandate, the importance of ensuring \r\nlocal judicial capacity becomes all the more pressing. \r\nIt is these local courts that will carry on what I \r\nconsider to be the real legacy of the International \r\nTribunal — our contribution to ending impunity. In that \r\nrespect, the international community must ensure that \r\nlocal courts can avail themselves of the resources \r\nnecessary to ensure the integrity of the prosecutions of \r\npersons accused of serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law. In particular, I note the need for \r\nadditional training of prison staff and for ensuring the \r\nprovision of conditions of detention that conform to \r\ninternational human rights standards.  \r\n As the completion strategy’s final dates loom, the \r\nInternational Tribunal has also focused its attention on \r\nother issues of importance to its legacy. In conjunction \r\nwith the ICTR, the Tribunal has identified the \r\n12 residual issues that will remain following the \r\ncompletion of cases currently pending on its docket. \r\nThose issues concern important matters such as \r\noutstanding fugitives, witness protection, enforcement \r\nand commutation of sentences, requests for review of \r\njudgements and archives. \r\n Currently, the Tribunal is working with the \r\nSecurity Council Working Group on the ad hoc \r\ninternational tribunals to ensure that residual \r\nmechanisms are in place to deal with all of these \r\nmatters and to guarantee the continued integrity of the \r\nTribunal’s work. In that respect, a final paper on legacy \r\nissues was submitted in September of this year. The \r\nTribunal will continue its work with the Working \r\nGroup in the coming months. \r\n The timely completion of the mandate of the \r\nTribunal has always been tied to the issue of \r\ncooperation of the States in the region, including in \r\nrespect of the arrest of outstanding fugitives. During \r\nthe reporting period, two of the International Tribunal’s \r\nsix long-standing fugitives were arrested and \r\ntransferred to The Hague: Zdravko Tolimir from \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina in May 2007, and Vlastimir \r\nDordevič from Montenegro on 17 June 2007. Those \r\narrests were made with the cooperation of \r\nGovernments in the region: Serbia and the Republika \r\nSrpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, assisted \r\nin the apprehension of Tolimir and Serbia and \r\nMontenegro assisted with the arrest of Vlastimir \r\nDordevič. \r\n While the International Tribunal is appreciative \r\nof the cooperation of those States in the arrests of those \r\ntwo fugitives, it remains frustrated with the continued \r\nfailure of the international community to arrest the \r\nremaining fugitives. We do not believe that nobody \r\nknows where these fugitives are and consider the \r\ncontinued failure to effect their arrests, particularly \r\nthose of Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, to be an \r\naffront to justice and the rule of law over impunity. \r\nIndeed, that failure stands in contradiction to the very \r\nprinciples that were proclaimed by the international \r\ncommunity and upon which the establishment of the \r\nTribunal was based. Accordingly, I again urge all States \r\nto abide by their international obligations to effect the \r\narrest of all of these fugitives immediately. Without \r\ntheir arrest and trial, the mission of the International \r\nTribunal will not be completed.  \r\n Another issue that involves State cooperation is \r\nthe relocation of witnesses and the enforcement of the \r\nInternational Tribunal’s sentences. During the reporting \r\nperiod, the Registry managed to secure two additional \r\nagreements on the relocation of sensitive witnesses and \r\n A/62/PV.25\r\n \r\n7 07-54249 \r\n \r\ntwo enforcement-of-sentence agreements, with \r\nBelgium and the Ukraine, the latter being the first East \r\nEuropean State to enter into such an agreement. While \r\nthis represents progress, the Tribunal calls on all States \r\nwhich have not yet entered into any such agreements to \r\ndo so in order that the burden of international justice \r\ncan be better shared. \r\n I would now like to turn to another issue of \r\npressing concern to me as President of the International \r\nTribunal, that is, the retention of the International \r\nTribunal’s qualified and talented staff and of the \r\nInternational Tribunal’s judges. The International \r\nTribunal’s efficiency results directly from the \r\ncommitment and dedication of the individuals who \r\ncarry out its activities. The judges and staff employed \r\nby the International Tribunal are motivated by the ideal \r\nof serving the cause of international justice and by \r\ntheir desire to bring justice to the victims of the \r\nconflict. However, working at the Tribunal is not \r\nwithout its pressures, related to the need to speed up \r\nour work to meet completion strategy dates, the \r\nconstant assessments and reassessments of our \r\nmethodologies to maintain and increase current \r\nefficiency levels, the question of the continuing \r\nsupport of the international community and of course, \r\npressures about the future.  \r\n We all know that the Tribunal will complete its \r\nwork in the near future and that those who have \r\ndedicated many years of service to it will have to seek \r\nnew career opportunities. Member States have assisted \r\nus with improving conditions and further training \r\nopportunities for our staff and we look forward to their \r\ncontinued support for further measures as we approach \r\nthe downsizing phase of the Tribunal. We will continue \r\nto work with the United Nations Secretariat to develop \r\nmeasures which may further increase the career \r\nprospects for our staff as we close. It is with concern \r\nthat I note that, already, talented members of staff are \r\nleaving the Tribunal for more attractive employment in \r\nother institutions dedicated to the cause of international \r\njustice, including taking up offers from other United \r\nNations bodies. I urge the General Assembly not to \r\noverlook the impact of staff departures on the timely \r\ncompletion of the International Tribunal’s work. \r\nMember States’ support for suitable staff retention \r\npolicies is critical.  \r\n I must also express to the General Assembly my \r\nconcern about the retention of the Tribunal’s judges. \r\nMembers of the Assembly are aware of the long-\r\nstanding issue of the conditions and service of the \r\nInternational Tribunal’s judges and, in particular, the \r\ndiscrimination suffered by ICTY judges in the \r\nassessment of their pension entitlements vis-à-vis the \r\njudges of the International Court of Justice. \r\nUnfortunately, a failure to resolve this issue in a \r\nfavourable manner is likely to result in the departure of \r\nsome of the Tribunal’s most experienced judges, who \r\nwill feel compelled to leave the Tribunal to secure \r\npension entitlements in their national jurisdictions. \r\nThis is not a situation that would sit comfortably with \r\nthe timely and efficient completion of the Tribunal’s \r\nwork. I invite members of the Assembly to look closely \r\nat this issue and its likely broader implications before \r\nmaking a binding decision on these matters. \r\n The noteworthy achievements of the International \r\nTribunal thus far have been possible because of the \r\nunwavering support of members of the Assembly. With \r\ntheir assistance, the International Tribunal has \r\ndemonstrated to the world that fighting impunity while \r\nupholding due process norms is possible.  \r\n However, I must reiterate that the Assembly’s \r\ncontinued support will be more vital than ever in these \r\nlast few years of the Tribunal’s mandate. I call upon all \r\nMember States to assist us in meeting our commitment \r\nto seeing the work of the Tribunal successfully through \r\nto the end. This is not only necessary to ensure that the \r\nhistoric work of the Tribunal is complete; it is essential \r\nto the cause of international justice and as a means of \r\naddressing threats to international peace and security \r\nand of promoting human rights.  \r\n With each successful prosecution, the \r\nInternational Tribunal is shoring up the foundations of \r\na still nascent international system of criminal justice \r\ncomprising a growing number of international judicial \r\ninstitutions acting together in a coordinated partnership \r\nwith domestic jurisdictions. The International \r\nTribunal’s pioneering role and its unprecedented body \r\nof practice and case law will be its most significant \r\nachievement and the continuation of its work by local \r\nprosecutions of war criminals in the region its real \r\nlegacy.  \r\n The Acting President: I now have the honour of \r\ngiving the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ivo Sanader, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Croatia. \r\n Mr. Sanader (Croatia): It is a great privilege for \r\nme to participate in the deliberations at this session of \r\nthe General Assembly dedicated to the International \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 8 \r\n \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  \r\nI listened with the utmost interest to the introduction \r\nby the President of the ICTY, Judge Fausto Pocar, of \r\nthe Tribunal’s annual report (A/62/172). We highly \r\nappreciate Judge Pocar’s work. I am also pleased that \r\nthe Tribunal appreciates its cooperation with Croatia. \r\n I want to emphasize that the Republic of Croatia \r\nwas one of the proponents of the establishment of the \r\nICTY — not only as a country directly affected by the \r\nwar, but also as a country committed to establishing an \r\ninternational institution devoted to the implementation \r\nof criminal adjudication for the purpose of \r\ninternational justice. Now, 14 years later, we note with \r\nsatisfaction that a number of the goals of the Tribunal’s \r\nmandate and mission have been achieved. Some of the \r\nmajor perpetrators have been prosecuted, peace has \r\nbeen restored and confidence is growing. However, \r\nthere is still room for improvement. It is only through \r\nproper analysis of the work of the ICTY that we can \r\ndraw precious lessons for the future. And it is with a \r\nview to the future that we have to be thorough and \r\ncritical in evaluating its work. \r\n The role of the ICTY, and the messages that it \r\nsends through its practice, are of extreme importance \r\ntoday, when humanity is being continuously \r\nchallenged. By properly and justly prosecuting those \r\nresponsible for war crimes and atrocities committed in \r\nthe past in places such as Vukovar, Srebrenica and \r\nRwanda, we also discourage those who are willing or \r\naiming to do — or who are already doing — the same \r\nthings today in places such as Darfur. \r\n We strongly believe that one of the aims of \r\nreform of the United Nations system should be to \r\nenhance the indispensable role of United Nations \r\ninstitutions in the prevention of gross human rights \r\nviolations and in the protection and promotion of \r\nhumanitarian law and of the rule of law in general. \r\nStrict adherence to humanitarian law and the rule of \r\nlaw at the national and international levels is essential \r\nfor a more peaceful and just world, for human security \r\nand for trustful cooperation among peoples and \r\nnations. The prosecution of war crimes and of the \r\ngravest breaches of humanitarian law must be fully \r\nensured. \r\n That brings into focus the role and the \r\nresponsibilities of existing institutions, including the \r\nHague Tribunal. In many cases, the Tribunal has been a \r\nvehicle for justice and for asserting the values of \r\nhumanity. However, no institution should be immune \r\nfrom criticism. Proper analysis of the Tribunal’s work \r\ndoes not challenge its independence; rather, it is the \r\nonly way to learn from experience, for the benefit of \r\ninternational justice. \r\n Ensuring a just outcome of prosecution is the \r\nonly way to discourage those who might consider \r\nrepeating such crimes, today or in the future. Just \r\npunishment offers a measure of respect for the victims. \r\nJust punishment is the best deterrent. Just punishment \r\nalso serves truth and opens the way for lasting peace, \r\nsecurity and reconciliation. \r\n With that in mind, I have come here to express to \r\nthe Assembly the dismay of the people of Croatia over \r\nthe recent first-instance ruling in the Vukovar hospital \r\ncase, concerning the massacre of patients at Ovcara \r\nfarm. In my letter of 28 September 2007 (A/62/378, \r\nannex), I informed United Nations Member States \r\naccordingly. \r\n Vukovar is a Danube River town located on the \r\neastern border of Croatia. Like the inhabitants of any \r\ntown in any other part of the world, its people wanted \r\nnothing more than to live peacefully and to work to \r\nbuild a prosperous future. But in 1991, during the \r\naggression against Croatia, Vukovar was attacked with \r\ngreat force by the so-called Yugoslav People’s Army \r\n(JNA). That attack had been planned in great detail, \r\nwith lines of command clearly established by the \r\nmilitary and political leadership of Milosevic’s regime \r\nin Belgrade. During the attack, the JNA had both  \r\nde jure and de facto command and control over all Serb \r\nforces, including territorial defence forces and \r\nparamilitary units. Tens of thousands of troops \r\nparticipated in the aggression and the siege directed \r\nagainst Vukovar.  \r\n Hundreds of tanks pounded the town for months, \r\nrazing it to the ground. The 52 mass graves later \r\ndiscovered in the Vukovar area attest to the severity of \r\nthe onslaught. Gunboats and combat aeroplanes were \r\nused indiscriminately by the JNA. Families were \r\nexpelled from their homes by the thousands in what \r\nwould later become known as a pattern of ethnic \r\ncleansing. The survivors of the Vukovar siege were \r\ndisplaced and sought refuge in 570 locations around \r\nthe world. \r\n Vukovar is the place where the worst war crimes \r\nin the territory of the Republic of Croatia were \r\ncommitted during the Serb aggression by Milosevic’s \r\n A/62/PV.25\r\n \r\n9 07-54249 \r\n \r\nregime. On 20 November 1991, after Serb forces had \r\noccupied the city, 261 patients from the Vukovar \r\nhospital were taken to Ovcara farm, where they were \r\ntortured and killed in cold blood. Out of 200 exhumed \r\ncrime victims, 190 have been identified; 61 victims are \r\nstill missing. The documents on the bodies of the \r\nidentified persons undoubtedly confirmed that they \r\nwere the people who had been taken from the Vukovar \r\nhospital. Those documents have been delivered to the \r\nICTY, and the Ovcara massacre was included by the \r\nprosecution in the indictment against Slobodan \r\nMilosevic in 2001. \r\n The crime committed at Ovcara farm, because of \r\nits horrifying nature, its utter cruelty and the \r\nhelplessness of its victims, occupies a special place \r\namong the crimes committed in the modern world. On \r\n27 September 2007, 16 years later, the Trial Chamber \r\nof the ICTY issued a judgement concerning three \r\nformer senior officers of the JNA. Mile Mrksic was \r\nsentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment and Veselin \r\nSljivancanin to 5 years’ imprisonment, while Miroslav \r\nRadic was acquitted. \r\n That judgement has caused consternation in \r\nCroatia and throughout the world. It defies the well-\r\nknown and documented facts relevant to the \r\nestablishment of responsibility. The Tribunal treated \r\nthe Ovcara massacre as an isolated case, rather than as \r\npart of a systematic policy whose chain of command \r\nled to the JNA’s military headquarters and to the then \r\npolitical leadership in Belgrade. Although all three \r\nindictees had been involved in numerous war crimes in \r\nVukovar and Eastern Slavonia, the prosecution \r\nrestricted its indictments to the best-known and most-\r\ndocumented Ovcara massacre. The prosecution might \r\nhave expected that the horrible crimes committed in \r\nOvcara would be sufficient for the maximum sentences \r\nto be imposed, but that did not happen. \r\n Without a doubt, the mistreatment and killing of \r\nthe patients from the Vukovar hospital were the result \r\nof premeditated unlawful actions by the occupying \r\nPower. Therefore, we have the right to ask why the \r\nGeneva Conventions, whose principles were \r\nincorporated into the Statute of the ICTY, were ignored \r\nin determining the guilt of these JNA officers? The \r\nOvcara crime was not an isolated incident. War crimes \r\ndo not begin at the scene of the crime; nor are they \r\ncommitted only as a result of circumstances existing in \r\nthe battlefield. These crimes were preceded by policies \r\nthat had created the conditions for future violence, with \r\nthe goal of ethnically cleansing that Croatian territory \r\nand the expelling the non-Serb population. \r\n That is supported by the fact that, ever since late \r\nAugust 1991, mass graves have appeared, not only in \r\nthe territory of Eastern Slavonia, but also in other parts \r\nof Croatia that have experienced aggression, such as \r\nBanovina, Western Slavonia and Lika. So far, 143 mass \r\ngraves have been discovered and their contents \r\nexhumed. Those mass graves contained, for the most \r\npart, the remains of ordinary citizens who remained in \r\ntheir homes following the occupation, as well as those \r\nof prisoners of war. \r\n At the time of the Vukovar massacre the world \r\nwas shocked. Sixteen years later a new shock followed. \r\nCroatia is deeply hurt by the injustice done to the \r\nCroatian people in Vukovar by demeaning this \r\nundeniable, inhumane and deliberate crime in the first-\r\ninstance sentence. In this respect, Croatia is not alone: \r\nthe sentence provoked many negative reactions from \r\ninternational human rights groups and prominent \r\nindividuals, Government officials and parliamentarians, \r\nincluding the European Union-Croatia Joint \r\nParliamentary Committee. The victims of this atrocity \r\nare sorely missed by their families and by the Croatian \r\npeople. Let me be clear. I am bringing back the most \r\npainful memories of those days because I strongly \r\nbelieve they must serve as a reminder for the world \r\ntoday: never again! \r\n This is where the responsibility of the ICTY is so \r\nevident, as nothing encourages crime more then \r\nimpunity. And it is precisely for this reason that the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia was established in 1993. \r\n Croatia expects that upon the Prosecutor’s appeal, \r\nthe ICTY Appeals Chamber will carefully re-examine \r\nthis verdict and act in accordance with the clear \r\nmandate assigned to it by the Security Council. We ask \r\nfor justice for all victims in Vukovar and elsewhere. \r\nThis is of paramount importance for the future of \r\ninternational criminal justice. \r\n It is of paramount importance because all crimes \r\nare individual. They must not be related to any nation. \r\nFairness, truth and justice should help to close the \r\npages of recent history in South-Eastern Europe. \r\nCroatia is ready to lead the way in this endeavour. We \r\nhope that today’s post-Milosevic democratically \r\noriented political forces and leadership in Serbia are \r\nchoosing the same direction. That would further \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 10 \r\n \r\nstrengthen regional confidence and cooperation and \r\nensure lasting peace and stability in the region. One of \r\nthe preconditions for this is the extradition of two of \r\nthe most infamous indicted war criminals Karadžić and \r\nMladić, as well as Hadžić, indicted for war crimes \r\ncommitted in Vukovar and Eastern Slavonia. In that \r\nway, justice would be fully served. \r\n The indictment against Milosevic came too late \r\nafter the horrible crimes committed in Croatia to serve \r\nas a deterrent for new crimes, not only in Croatia, but \r\nalso in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo. His \r\ndeath made it impossible for his sentence to clearly \r\noutline the development of a political policy that used \r\naggression and the systematic application of war \r\ncrimes and which represents the framework within \r\nwhich all other individual crimes in the territory of the \r\nformer Yugoslavia have been committed, regardless of \r\ntheir perpetrators. \r\n Moreover, no indictments have ever been filed \r\nagainst Veljko Kadijevic and Blagoje Adzic, leaders of \r\nthe JNA, who were instrumental in implementing such \r\npolicies through military means, and at the very least \r\nthrough command responsibility — but also likely \r\nthrough participation in a joint criminal enterprise \r\nresponsible for numerous war crimes.  \r\n Improvement is also possible in some other areas, \r\nand in this respect Croatia reaffirms its commitment, as \r\na responsible and credible member of the international \r\ncommunity, to continue to fully cooperate with the \r\nTribunal and its readiness to offer help and assistance \r\nin order to enable the Tribunal to fulfil the tasks I have \r\ndescribed. \r\n The Croatian judiciary has shown its maturity in \r\nfairly and freely trying even the most sensitive cases. \r\nAs a result, the ICTY demonstrated its trust in the \r\nCroatian judiciary by transferring the cases of the \r\nCroatian officers Ademi and Norac to the Croatian \r\ncourt. Within the framework of the ICTY’s completion \r\nstrategy, which we fully support, Croatia stands ready \r\nto take over all the remaining cases involving Croatian \r\ncitizens. \r\n The issue of punishment for war crimes relates to \r\nresponsibility in a broader sense. It relates to the \r\nresponsibility of the international community to ensure \r\neffectiveness in preventing conflict and protecting and \r\npromoting human rights, humanitarian law and the rule \r\nof law in general. It relates also to the present state of \r\naffairs in the world. Let us look around us. Evidence of \r\ninhumanity, violence and human suffering is only too \r\nvisible. \r\n My message from this rostrum is clear and \r\nforthright: everybody, everywhere, should have no \r\ndoubt that any and all crimes against humanity will not \r\nbe allowed to go unpunished. That is our common \r\nresponsibility. Only then can we create a better world \r\nfor posterity. Croatia considers the United Nations to \r\nbe an indispensable instrument in our common struggle \r\nfor such a future — a future that will bring hope to new \r\ngenerations and a more peaceful and just world. \r\n The world must be a better place tomorrow. This \r\nis our responsibility today. Vukovar’s victims deserve \r\njustice. \r\n Mr. Tavares (Portugal): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\ncandidate country the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Montenegro, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of \r\nMoldova and Armenia align themselves with this \r\ndeclaration. \r\n The European Union is strongly supportive of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The Tribunals are \r\nmaking an invaluable contribution towards the \r\nattainment of our shared goal of ending impunity for \r\nthose who perpetrate genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes. They have played a key role \r\nin the development of international criminal law by \r\nbuilding up an extensive jurisprudence, not least in \r\nrelation to the crime of genocide. One such important \r\ncontribution from the case law of the ICTR is the \r\nfinding that acts of rape and sexual violence committed \r\nwith intent to destroy a protected group as such can \r\nconstitute genocide. And by bringing to justice the \r\nperpetrators of these most shocking crimes, the \r\nTribunals have helped to strengthen the rule of law and \r\npromote long-term stability and reconciliation in the \r\nBalkans and in Rwanda. \r\n The European Union welcomes the ongoing \r\nefforts by the ICTY and the ICTR to fulfil their \r\ncompletion strategies and continues to urge both \r\nTribunals to build on the progress already made. At the \r\nsame time, the EU urges States to fulfil their \r\nobligations under Security Council resolutions 1503 \r\n(2003) and 1534 (2004) in order to enable the \r\n A/62/PV.25\r\n \r\n11 07-54249 \r\n \r\nTribunals to speedily complete their work. In \r\nparticular, the EU calls on all those involved to \r\nredouble their efforts to expedite the arrest and \r\nsurrender of the remaining fugitive indictees. In the \r\ncontext of the ICTY, the EU remains absolutely \r\ncommitted to seeing Ratko Mladić and Radovan \r\nKaradžić face international justice. \r\n The European Union has adopted two Common \r\nPositions in order to support the effective \r\nimplementation of the mandate of the ICTY by \r\nimposing an assets freeze on indicted fugitives and a \r\ntravel ban on persons assisting ICTY indictees to evade \r\njustice. Cooperation with the Tribunal is also addressed \r\nin the context of the Stabilization and Association \r\nProcess (SAP). Full cooperation with the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is \r\na condition imposed on the Stabilisation and \r\nAssociation Process (SAP) countries, namely Croatia, \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania, for \r\ntheir moving forward in the process. Since 2003, the \r\nSAP countries have been asked to align themselves \r\nwith the Common Positions. When the Tribunal ends \r\nits mandate, those countries will have the main \r\nresponsibility for bringing justice to the victims of the \r\nconflicts. It is therefore important that the judiciary and \r\nthe police of the countries of the region cooperate with \r\na view to dismantling the support network of possible \r\nfugitives. Governments should not intervene in the \r\nwork of domestic prosecution. \r\n The European Union welcomes Serbia’s recent \r\nefforts to improve cooperation with the ICTY. \r\nNonetheless, the European Union continues to believe \r\nthat full cooperation between Serbia and the Tribunal is \r\na fundamental requirement for its conclusion of the \r\nSAP. \r\n Let me also briefly address some issues related to \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR). The European Union welcomes the \r\nachievements of the ICTR since we last discussed this \r\nissue a year ago. In his address to the Security Council \r\non 18 June 2007, Judge Dennis Byron, President of the \r\nICTR, recalled that the total number of cases \r\ncompleted in the first instance is now 27, involving \r\n33 accused. The major challenge in terms of ongoing \r\ntrials remains four multi-accused cases, involving \r\n17 accused. \r\n Concerning convicted persons, six of them are \r\ncurrently incarcerated in Mali, while the other \r\nconvicted persons remain at the facility in Arusha. In \r\naddition, the Tribunal has concluded enforcement of \r\nsentence agreements with Benin, Swaziland, France, \r\nItaly and Sweden. The European Union strongly \r\nencourages States to conclude agreements on the \r\nrelocation of witnesses and the enforcement of \r\nsentences with both Tribunals. \r\n The strengthening of the Rwandan judicial \r\nsystem and the improvement of its capacity to \r\nprosecute cases transferred from the Tribunal is also a \r\ngoal that the European Union fully supports. It is fully \r\nin line with Security Council resolution 1503 (2003). \r\nThe Tribunal provides support to local judiciary and \r\nprosecutors in the region, as further described in the \r\ncompletion strategy. \r\n The European Union also welcomes the \r\nTribunal’s outreach programme and its work through \r\nvarious initiatives, namely the ICTR Outreach \r\nProgramme, awareness-raising programmes within \r\nRwanda, efforts to strengthen relations with academic \r\ninstitutions in Rwanda and to develop media there, and \r\nthe development of active cooperation with and \r\nassistance to Rwandan civil society organizations. \r\n The ICTR faces two particular challenges — \r\nfugitive indictees and the proposed transfer of cases to \r\nRwanda. There are currently 17 fugitive indictees, \r\nincluding Félicien Kabuga. The European Union urges \r\nall States to fulfil their obligations with respect to the \r\narrest and surrender of outstanding indictees. With \r\nregard to the transfer of cases, the European Union \r\nwelcomes Rwanda’s efforts to strengthen its judicial \r\nsystem and build capacity to prosecute cases \r\ntransferred by the ICTR. The final decision on transfer \r\nis, of course, a question for the ICTR judges. \r\n To conclude, the Tribunals cannot succeed \r\nwithout the firm commitment of States to cooperate in \r\naccordance with their legal obligations. It is vital that \r\nthis commitment be strengthened and sustained as the \r\nTribunals approach the final stages of their work. This \r\nwork will not be finished before Radovan Karadžić, \r\nRatko Mladić and Félicien Kabuga are brought before \r\nthe ICTY and the ICTR respectively. The European \r\nUnion therefore reiterates its strong call to all Member \r\nStates to live up to their international obligations by \r\narresting and transferring the accused at large to The \r\nHague and Arusha without delay. Continuing delays in \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 12 \r\n \r\ntransfer also put in jeopardy the timely implementation \r\nof the completion strategies. \r\n The international community must not send the \r\nmessage that perpetrators of the most serious \r\ninternational crimes of genocide, war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity can go unpunished. Impunity \r\nis simply not an option. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of Australia, New Zealand and Canada \r\n(CANZ) today.  \r\n Allow me to begin by paying tribute to the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunals for the former \r\nYugoslavia and Rwanda. Their work has contributed to \r\nensuring greater accountability for those who commit \r\nwar crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. In \r\nso doing, they have developed a body of jurisprudence \r\non multiple questions of international criminal law that \r\nis unprecedented. The two International Criminal \r\nTribunals paved the way for other international \r\ncriminal tribunals, including the International Criminal \r\nCourt. \r\n Both tribunals are scheduled to end their pending \r\ntrials in the next two years. CANZ is encouraged by \r\nthe attention being given by each Tribunal to its \r\ncompletion strategy, and we welcome the \r\nreappointments of the Prosecutors, Hassan Jallow and \r\nCarla Del Ponte, who will continue to lend their \r\nexpertise and knowledge of the courts as they complete \r\ntheir work. \r\n CANZ fully supports the implementation of the \r\ncompletion strategies of both Tribunals. We also \r\nwelcome efforts to refer cases involving intermediate \r\nand lower-ranking accused to national jurisdictions, as \r\npart of the Tribunals’ completion strategies. In this \r\nregard, we would note that all referred cases should be \r\nconducted in full compliance with the highest \r\nstandards of due process. We encourage the \r\ninternational community to help strengthen national \r\njustice systems, where required, in support of the \r\noverall completion strategy. With respect to national \r\njustice systems, we especially welcome Rwanda’s \r\ndecision to formally abolish the death penalty. This \r\nimportant decision will further enhance the \r\ndevelopment of human rights. \r\n In order for the Tribunals to complete their work, \r\nhowever, it is imperative that all remaining indictees be \r\nsurrendered. We note with satisfaction that this past \r\nyear has seen the arrest and transfer of Vlastimir \r\nDordevič and Zdravko Tolimir to the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). \r\nMore must be done, however, including the immediate \r\nsurrender of Radovan Karadžić, Ratko Mladić and \r\nFélicien Kabuga. States that continue to provide \r\nprotection to these fugitives from international justice \r\nundermine not only our common fight against \r\nimpunity, but also their own commitment to the rule of \r\nlaw. \r\n(spoke in French)  \r\n As the Tribunals begin implementing their \r\ncompletion strategies, increasing attention will need to \r\nbe paid to so-called legacy issues — the important, \r\npractical and sometimes complex actions that need to \r\nbe taken on the judicial level and others, activities that \r\nwill need to be carried out once the last indictee has \r\nbeen tried. In that regard, we note with appreciation the \r\nplans for a study on the future of the archives of the \r\nTribunals. Canada, Australia and New Zealand \r\nencourage the Tribunals to make tackling those issues a \r\npriority and to work in close cooperation with other \r\ninternational criminal courts, such as the Special Court \r\nfor Sierra Leone, in order to share ideas and \r\nexperience. \r\n Australia, New Zealand and Canada are strong \r\nsupporters of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia and International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda and will continue to lend them \r\nassistance as they lead the way towards enhanced \r\naccountability for international crimes. We call on all \r\nStates to assist the Tribunals and to support their \r\nefforts to complete their work within the agreed time \r\nframes.  \r\n The Tribunals have accomplished a great deal, \r\nbut they cannot do it without our support. \r\n Mr. Løvald (Norway): Allow me to begin by \r\nexpressing Norway’s continuing support and full \r\nrecognition of the achievements and the high standards \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and \r\nthe former Yugoslavia, as reflected in the Tribunals’ \r\nwell-reasoned judgements and the annual reports \r\nbefore us. We would like to thank the Presidents of the \r\nTribunals for their detailed and informative reports, \r\nwhich reflect the progress made during the period \r\nunder review. \r\n A/62/PV.25\r\n \r\n13 07-54249 \r\n \r\n As we have consistently held, the work of the \r\nTribunals contributes to bringing justice to the victims \r\nof the massive crimes that were committed. It will \r\nleave a legacy of international jurisprudence that can \r\nguide future courts, deter the future commission of \r\nthose grave crimes and prevent impunity for potential \r\nperpetrators. As such, they are contributing to the \r\ndevelopment of international criminal justice and the \r\nfight against impunity for mass atrocities in general. \r\n We commend both Tribunals for their \r\ncommitment to meeting the completion strategy, while \r\nensuring that due process standards and fundamental \r\nlegal principles are fully respected. \r\n According to the report of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the \r\nTribunal has concluded proceedings against 106 of the \r\n161 who have been charged to date. For the first time \r\nin the Tribunal’s history, the three Trial Chambers \r\noperated at full capacity and ran seven trials \r\nsimultaneously, three of which involved 18 accused \r\npersons. In addition, the Appeals Chamber issued a \r\nrecord number of decisions, including 11 judgements \r\nin the past year, seven of which were in the past six \r\nmonths. \r\n To date, the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda has concluded proceedings against 33 accused \r\npersons. In addition, trials involving 22 accused in \r\nvarious cases are in progress. Eight detainees are \r\nawaiting trial. The Appeals Chamber has issued a large \r\nnumber of decisions, including four appeal judgements \r\nin respect of six persons. \r\n The report of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda stresses that the success of the completion \r\nstrategy will continue to depend on the assistance and \r\ncooperation of States. We fully agree. We appeal to all \r\nStates to demonstrate — not just in words, but also in \r\npractice — their full cooperation with the Tribunals. As \r\nthe work of the Tribunal nears completion, it is crucial \r\nthat States give it their unreserved support. It is of the \r\nutmost importance that all States honour their financial \r\ncommitments and pay their assessed contributions on \r\ntime. \r\n Furthermore, Member States must fulfil their \r\nobligation to arrest and transfer fugitives to the \r\nTribunals without delay. We compliment the Prosecutors \r\non their efforts to secure the arrest of the remaining \r\nfugitives, and we urge the States involved to cooperate \r\nfully with the Tribunals. \r\n It is not acceptable that perpetrators of serious \r\ninternational crimes evade legal proceedings. The main \r\nmission of the Tribunals will not be fulfilled unless the \r\nhighest-ranking indictees are brought to justice. \r\n Norway has an agreement with the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia regarding \r\nthe enforcement of sentences and cooperates closely \r\nwith the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in \r\nseveral fields. There is a pressing need for more States \r\nto enter into agreements regarding the enforcement of \r\njudgements. It is unreasonable that only a few Member \r\nStates should shoulder that important responsibility. \r\n We strongly support the Tribunals’ external \r\nactivities and their involvement and cooperation with \r\nlocal judiciaries. As stated in the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia, an active engagement with local judiciaries \r\nwill help to ensure that local courts have the capacity \r\nto continue the Tribunal’s work in the future. \r\n All States must honour their international \r\nobligation to cooperate with regard to requests for full \r\nand effective assistance to the Tribunals. That applies \r\nwith regard to witnesses, financial and material support \r\nand practical assistance in the enforcement of \r\nsentences. All States should demonstrate their \r\ncommitment to the Tribunals by means of active and \r\nconcrete actions. \r\n Norway will stand by its long-term commitment \r\nto the successful completion of the mandates assigned \r\nto the two Tribunals by the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Jevremović (Serbia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to give my respects to the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court for the Former \r\nYugoslavia, Judge Fausto Pocar. Special tribute should \r\nalso go to the Chief Prosecutor, Mrs. Del Ponte, who is \r\ntoday reporting to the European Union ministers in \r\nLuxembourg. We highly appreciate their efforts and \r\ncontributions to strengthening international law and \r\nmoral standards in bringing to justice perpetrators of \r\nthe most serious violations of humanitarian law and the \r\nlaw of the conduct of war in the tragic conflicts in the \r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia. \r\n We welcome the recognition, in the report, of the \r\ncooperation by the relevant Serbian authorities with the \r\nProsecutor’s Office, and I can assure you that in the \r\nfuture that cooperation will be maintained and \r\nexpanded. Only through joint efforts can we solve the \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 14 \r\n \r\noutstanding cases of apprehending the remaining \r\nfugitives, notably Ratko Mladić and others. \r\n There were disagreements and objections by the \r\nProsecutor’s Office, particularly regarding the level of \r\ncooperation on the part of our relevant authorities. At \r\nsome points, we were critical of the proceedings of the \r\nTribunal. However, the contribution of the Tribunal is, \r\noverall, positive, and lasting and evident. Effectively \r\nprosecuting persons responsible for war crimes and \r\nbringing them to justice is an imperative and has been \r\na prerequisite for the reconciliation process and for \r\npeaceful life in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. \r\nThe only way to accomplish that is for every national \r\ncommunity to disassociate itself, through the legal \r\njudiciary process, from the grave crimes that were \r\ncommitted in the past. That is an indispensable part of \r\nthe process of joining in European integration and \r\nshared values. \r\n Successful completion of our cooperation with \r\nthe ICTY is one of the objectives of the Serbian \r\nGovernment, reflecting the general consensus that it is \r\nin Serbia’s interest to take all requisite measures to \r\ncomplete that cooperation swiftly and effectively. \r\nThere should be no doubt that we are committed to \r\nfulfilling our international obligations in that regard. \r\n I would like to point out that, just a few days ago, \r\nthe Serbian National Security Council decided to offer \r\n€1 million for information leading to the location and \r\nsubsequent arrest of Ratko Mladić. As for the other \r\nHague indictees, €250,000 is being offered for \r\ninformation concerning Stojan Zupljanin and Goran \r\nHadzić.  \r\n We fully support the completion strategy of the \r\nICTY, as defined in Security Council resolutions \r\n1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004). The basic prerequisite \r\nfor the success of the strategy is undoubtedly the \r\ncapacity of domestic courts to process, in accordance \r\nwith international legal standards, cases that have been \r\ntransferred by the ICTY. The referral of the cases from \r\nthe Tribunal to national jurisdictions has helped in \r\nmany ways to achieve a full level of trust between the \r\nGovernments of the Balkan region and international \r\ninstitutions. Similarly, the referral of such legal cases \r\nto national jurisdictions further facilitates full \r\ncooperation with the ICTY. \r\n I can assure the Assembly that, as a result of \r\nsubstantial reforms, our national judiciary is now able \r\nto legally process the most complicated cases. Let me \r\nbring to the attention of Members that two important \r\ncases are currently being heard regarding crimes \r\ncommitted in Croatia and Kosovo: the notorious \r\nOvcara case and the Suva Reka case, respectively. \r\n The Prime Minister of Serbia, in a letter dated \r\n25 July 2007, informed the Secretary-General of \r\nSerbia’s intention to launch in the region an initiative \r\nto transfer persons convicted by the ICTY to the \r\ncountries of their citizenship. Serbia has officially \r\ncalled upon the representatives of the Government of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and of the Government of \r\nCroatia to support that initiative.  \r\n We are all aware that there is no statute of \r\nlimitation for war crimes, and national judiciaries, \r\nincluding that of Serbia, are obliged to process such \r\ncases in the future. International experience reminds us \r\nthat bringing to justice those who have committed war \r\ncrimes remains an enduring legal and moral obligation. \r\n Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda): I wish to thank \r\nJudge Dennis Byron, President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), for presenting \r\nthe twelfth annual report on the work of the Tribunal. \r\n As we come towards the end of the mandate of \r\nthe Tribunal, it becomes ever more critical for the \r\nUnited Nations to focus its attention on the legacy and \r\nresidual issues of the Tribunal. Key among those issues \r\nare the court’s documents and materials. The \r\nGovernment and the people of Rwanda would like \r\nthose documents — which tell the story of our painful \r\nhistory — to be transferred after 2008 to Rwanda, \r\nwhere they could form an important basis for an \r\ninternational educational and research centre on \r\ngenocide prevention. We look forward to an early \r\ndecision in that regard by the Security Council, as well \r\nas to support from the international community aimed \r\nat the establishment of the centre.  \r\n While we welcome the Tribunal’s training \r\nprogrammes for the Rwandan judiciary, those efforts \r\nmust be accelerated significantly in view of the \r\ncompletion strategy. We therefore call upon the \r\nTribunal to take further steps in that respect in \r\ncollaboration with the Government. We also welcome \r\nthe outreach activities, although much work remains to \r\nbe done to disseminate information about the \r\nTribunal’s work to the areas and villages that were \r\nmost affected by the genocide. \r\n A/62/PV.25\r\n \r\n15 07-54249 \r\n \r\n Rwanda has welcomed the transfer of cases to \r\nnational jurisdictions, principally Rwanda. Significant \r\nprogress has been made with respect to the referral of \r\ncases. The Rwanda Government is committed to \r\ncontinuing its preparations to that end. An organic law \r\nhas been promulgated to govern all legal matters \r\npertaining to the referral of cases to Rwanda. Other \r\narrangements have been undertaken to ensure that all \r\nthe requirements outlined under rule 11 bis are met. \r\nOur partnership with the Office of the Prosecutor has \r\nenabled us to make significant progress in these areas. \r\n Rwanda has stated many times, before the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, that the \r\ntransfer of cases to our country is essential, so that \r\njustice is seen to be done where the crimes have been \r\ncommitted. It would also complement and reinforce \r\nongoing Government policies aimed at reconciliation, \r\nwhich is central to the mandate of the ICTR. In \r\naddition, in practical terms, holding the trials would be \r\nless costly and more efficient, since the evidence and \r\nthe witnesses are mostly within the country. \r\n The death penalty is no longer an issue of \r\nconcern with respect to the transfer of trials, since the \r\nRwandan parliament recently adopted legislation \r\nabolishing that practice.  \r\n Of equal importance is the question of \r\ntransferring convicts to serve sentences in Rwanda. We \r\nbelieve that ICTR convicts must serve their sentences \r\nin Rwanda, where they committed the crimes and \r\nwhere they should be seen serving their sentences. \r\nContinued delay in this area is causing substantial \r\ndamage to the process and to the reputation of the \r\nICTR. We urge those concerned to take urgent \r\nmeasures to remedy that situation. \r\n Rwanda appreciates the efforts made by the \r\nGerman authorities in apprehending Augustin \r\nNgirabatware on 17 September 2007. \r\n However, on the issue of fugitives still at large, \r\nparticularly Félicien Kabuga and other key \r\nmasterminds of the genocide, we once again appeal to \r\nMember States to work closely with one another to \r\nensure that these indictees do not escape justice. The \r\ncompletion strategy is not an exit strategy for our \r\ncollective commitment to bring to justice the authors \r\nand planners of the genocide. There is fairly good \r\ninformation about the whereabouts of many of the \r\nfugitives, but there is still little progress in arresting \r\nthem. We believe that measures should be undertaken \r\nto ensure that all States cooperate in apprehending and \r\nhanding over these fugitives for trial and that those that \r\nfail to do so are brought to account. \r\n I would like to conclude by expressing our \r\nprofound appreciation to the international community \r\nand to specific countries for their continued support of \r\nthe Tribunal through both assessed and voluntary \r\ncontributions. As we enter the last leg of the Tribunal’s \r\nwork, we urge Member States to continue their \r\ncommitment to ensuring that the Tribunal is adequately \r\nresourced to conduct its work efficiently and \r\neffectively through the full, timely and unconditional \r\ndisbursement of assessed contributions. \r\n We also thank the Tribunal President and his team \r\nfor their work in ensuring the implementation of the \r\ncompletion strategy. \r\n Mr. Prica (Bosnia and Herzegovina): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons \r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991, Judge Fausto Pocar, for \r\nthe fourteenth annual report of the Tribunal \r\n(A/62/172). The Government of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina has studied the report by the President of \r\nthe Tribunal with due attention.  \r\n Allow me to express our appreciation for the \r\nTribunal’s recognition of the efforts made by the \r\nauthorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels in \r\norder to achieve satisfactory cooperation with the \r\nTribunal, especially at the operational level. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to reiterate my country’s \r\nfirm commitment to continued full cooperation with \r\nthe Tribunal, a commitment confirmed and proved by \r\nthe extensive efforts and additional measures \r\nundertaken on the ground aimed at targeting fugitive \r\nsupport networks, thus further diminishing the \r\nmanoeuvring space for those indictees who remain at \r\nlarge. \r\n It is very important to mention the cooperation \r\nbetween the War Crimes Chamber of the State Court of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, established in March 2005, \r\nand the Office of the State Prosecutor of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. That cooperation has made significant \r\nprogress in processing a number of war crimes cases, \r\nfive of which have been transferred from the Tribunal. \r\nWe are very pleased to find very positive remarks in \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 16 \r\n \r\nparagraph 86 of the report regarding the activities of \r\nour aforementioned national judiciary bodies.  \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to support \r\nthe work of the Tribunal and to fully cooperate with the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor. Bosnia and Herzegovina is of \r\nthe position that the Tribunal should continue its work \r\nuntil the trials of all persons indicted for war crimes \r\nare completed by the Tribunal, especially the cases of \r\nRadovan Karadzić and Ratko Mladić, who are still at \r\nlarge. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): My delegation \r\nwishes to thank Judge Pocar of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and Judge \r\nByron of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda for their statements presenting the respective \r\nreports of the Tribunals.  \r\n My delegation commends the Tribunals for the \r\nsteps they are taking to ensure that they achieve their \r\ncompletion strategies. In particular, we welcome the \r\nmeasures taken to increase the efficiency of the \r\nTribunals in processing trials by holding a high number \r\nof trials simultaneously, making amendments to the \r\nrules of procedure for the purpose of expediting \r\nproceedings and making optimal use of ad litem \r\njudges. \r\n The completion strategies are time-bound, and \r\ntherefore, notwithstanding the steps that the Tribunals \r\nare taking to increase efficiency, there are cases that, \r\ndue to the passage of time and an inability to effect \r\narrests, will have to be referred to national \r\njurisdictions. Therefore, referrals to national \r\njurisdictions are central to achieving the completion \r\nstrategies, in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolution 1534 (2004). To that end, we commend the \r\nvarious countries that have accepted cases from the \r\nTribunals. We are, however, particularly keen to see the \r\ncountries where the crimes were committed assume the \r\nresponsibility of accepting referrals from the Tribunals. \r\nWe therefore welcome all efforts to provide technical \r\nassistance to those countries, to enable them to reform \r\ntheir justice and prison systems to absorb the cases \r\nfrom the Tribunals. We strongly believe that justice \r\nsector reform is a critical element of post-conflict \r\nreconstruction and that it contributes to security sector \r\nreform.  \r\n In the case of both Tribunals, there are indicted \r\npersons still at large, and some of them are particularly \r\nhigh-level accused or are alleged to have committed \r\ncrimes that should be dealt with at an international \r\nlevel. It is important that those fugitives ultimately be \r\nbrought to justice, and we call for full cooperation with \r\nthe Tribunals to arrest them and surrender them for \r\ntrial. My delegation calls for cooperation between \r\nStates and the two Tribunals. \r\n The fact that the Tribunals are working towards \r\ncompleting their work means that we must ensure that \r\nthey continue to receive sufficient resources to enable \r\nthem to complete their work and their mandates. As \r\nStates, we must continue to extend cooperation with \r\nrespect to travel of witnesses; the pursuit and bringing \r\nto justice of fugitives; the arrest and transfer of \r\naccused; and the resettlement of individuals who are \r\nacquitted by the Tribunals.  \r\n Furthermore, we need to address the issue of the \r\nlegacy that will be left by the Tribunals and ensure that \r\nwe preserve their achievements. The Tribunals were \r\nestablished by the Security Council, consistent with its \r\nresponsibility to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. Therefore, as we consider their legacy and \r\nachievements, we must measure them by the extent of \r\ntheir contribution to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.  \r\n It has been said that there can be no peace \r\nwithout justice. We believe the Tribunals have \r\nimmensely contributed to stability and peace, both in \r\nRwanda and in the former Yugoslavia. There will, \r\nhowever, continue to be ongoing work to consolidate \r\nthose achievements and to ensure the preservation of \r\nthe legacy of the Tribunals. That work includes \r\nensuring that the passage of time does not result in \r\nimpunity for any fugitives. It is important that the \r\narchives of the Tribunals be preserved and stored in \r\nplaces where future generations can have access to \r\nthem and can take lesson from the work of both \r\nTribunals. \r\n Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We thank the leadership of both Tribunals for \r\ntheir annual reports on the work of those bodies. \r\n We note the active work of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda in the last year. We \r\nwelcome the transfer of the cases of those accused by \r\nthe Tribunal to national judicial bodies, which, we \r\nbelieve, will ensure the timely implementation of the \r\ncompletion strategy within Security Council deadlines. \r\nIn that regard, we believe that it is important to step up \r\nefforts to develop the Rwandan judicial system, \r\n A/62/PV.25\r\n \r\n17 07-54249 \r\n \r\nincluding strengthening its capabilities for the judicial \r\nprosecution of individuals whose cases have been \r\ntransferred to it by the Tribunal.  \r\n The International Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia has also achieved a certain acceleration and \r\nenhancement in the effectiveness of its adjudication in \r\nthe last year, in particular by introducing amendments \r\nto its rules of procedure and evidence. We note the \r\narrest and transfer to the Tribunal of Zdravko Tolimir \r\nand Vlastimir Dordevič, which we hope will also serve \r\nas a positive element for the timely completion of the \r\nTribunal’s work. We believe that more active efforts \r\nshould be devoted to transferring the cases of the \r\naccused for consideration by the courts of States of the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. We note the Tribunal’s work on \r\nprotecting witnesses for Tribunal cases. We call on \r\nother international bodies to assist the Tribunal in that \r\ntask. \r\n The Russian Federation maintains its position of \r\nprinciple that the work of both Tribunals should be \r\ncompleted within the completion strategy time frame. \r\nIt is our view that the fact that the Tribunals do not \r\nhave Félicien Kabuga, Ratko Mladić, Radovan \r\nKaradžić or other accused cannot be considered as \r\njustification for an unlimited extension of the work of \r\nthose bodies. \r\n We believe that at this stage, the substantively \r\nfinal phase of the work of the Tribunals, they should \r\nfocus a portion of their efforts on thinking through the \r\noptions for settling the organizational aspects of \r\ncompleting their work, including, in particular, \r\nmaintaining the archives and judges’ pensions. It is our \r\nview that that process will be effective and will in fact \r\nprovide for the timely resolution of current Tribunal \r\ntasks without engaging in additional financial \r\nexpenditures for United Nations Member States. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the African Group. The African Group is \r\ngrateful to you, Mr. President, for convening this joint \r\ndebate on the reports of the two International Criminal \r\nTribunals established for the prosecution of persons \r\nresponsible for serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law committed in Rwanda and \r\nneighbouring States and in the territory of the former \r\nYugoslavia.  \r\n We thank the Presidents and Prosecutors of the \r\ntwo Tribunals for the comprehensive reports that they \r\nhave presented on the ongoing activities of the two \r\nTribunals in the discharge of their respective mandates \r\nand for their invaluable contribution to the fight \r\nagainst impunity for serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law. The increased efficiency \r\ndemonstrated by the two Tribunals is a clear testimony \r\nto their commitment to the cause of international \r\nrestorative justice and to their completion strategy.  \r\n The African Group considers that the progress \r\nachieved in the implementation of their completion \r\nstrategies was made possible owing to the following \r\nmajor factors: the efficiency displayed by the \r\nTribunals’ leadership in adjusting their mandate by \r\nfocusing on the prosecution and trial of the most senior \r\nleaders suspected of being most responsible for crimes \r\nwithin their area of jurisdiction; the transferring of \r\ncases involving persons of lower- to mid-levels of \r\nresponsibility to national jurisdictions in accordance \r\nwith the completion strategy endorsed by the Security \r\nCouncil in its resolution 1503 (2003); the cooperation \r\nof Members States, be it in the form of efforts to \r\nlocalize, arrest and transfer the indictees to the \r\nTribunals, in protecting witness, in hosting persons \r\nserving their sentences, or in organizing the \r\nprosecution of cases referred to their national \r\njurisdiction; and the generous contributions of Member \r\nStates and donors who have financially supported the \r\nactivities of the Tribunals in their core elements but \r\nalso in elements funded with voluntary contributions as \r\nOutreach Programmes. In that respect, the work of the \r\nInternational Tribunals constitutes an historical \r\nexample of multilateral cooperation for the \r\nadministration of international justice and for the \r\nenforcement of international law. \r\n The African Group expresses its high \r\nappreciation to all Member States that are supporting \r\nthe activities of the Tribunals, and urge those \r\nconcerned to give the full desired support and \r\nassistance to the Tribunals for the arrest and transfer of \r\nthe remaining fugitives in order to enable the Tribunals \r\nto fulfil their mandate according to their completion \r\nstrategy. \r\n The African Group calls upon the Governments \r\nwith which the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda is currently conducting negotiations for the \r\nreferral of cases to their national jurisdictions to \r\ncooperate actively with the Tribunal. The African \r\nGroup welcomes the dedication shown by the African \r\nCommission on Human and Peoples’ Rights in offering \r\nto monitor all cases transferred to African countries. \r\nA/62/PV.25  \r\n \r\n07-54249 18 \r\n \r\nThe African Group urges the international community \r\nto assist the African countries who accept to host \r\npersons serving their sentences to improve their \r\npenitentiary facilities. \r\n The proceedings of the two International \r\nTribunals demonstrate the strong resolve of the \r\ninternational community to strengthen the rule of law \r\nin the regions affected by mass atrocities. The African \r\nGroup welcomes the efforts undertaken through \r\ntraining and assistance for the development of \r\ndomestic jurisdictions. They are of utmost importance \r\nfor the legacy of the Tribunals as regards their \r\njurisprudence, which will inevitably not only enrich the \r\nlaw practice in the regions concerned, but are also of \r\ngreat value for the international judicial practice as a \r\nwhole. \r\n The African Group further welcomes the steps \r\nundertaken by the two Tribunals to efficiently manage \r\ntheir archives, especially the project initiated for the \r\n \r\npreparation and organization of the Tribunals’ records \r\nwith the goal of meeting future preservation and access \r\nrequirements. \r\n In conclusion, the African Group encourages the \r\ntwo International Tribunals to maintain the dynamic of \r\ntheir activities in order to bring justice to the victims. \r\nOnly thus can they achieve their rightful aspiration to \r\nlegitimacy to the greatest extent possible, and also \r\nfurther the promotion of national reconciliation and \r\nlasting peace in the countries concerned, as well as \r\ncontribute to the enhancement of the authority of \r\ninternational humanitarian law as a paramount pillar of \r\nhuman dignity. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these agenda items. May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda items 74 and 75? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 12.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
