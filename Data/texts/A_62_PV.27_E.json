(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nTribute to the memory of His Excellency Mr. Soe \r\nWin, Prime Minister of Myanmar \r\n \r\n The President: Before proceeding to the items on \r\nour agenda, it is my sad duty to pay tribute to the \r\nmemory of the late Prime Minister of the Union of \r\nMyanmar, His Excellency Mr. Soe Win, who passed \r\naway on Friday, 12 October 2007. \r\n On behalf of the General Assembly, I request the \r\nrepresentative of Myanmar to convey our condolences \r\nto the Government and the people of Myanmar and to \r\nthe bereaved family of His Excellency Mr. Soe Win. \r\n I now invite representatives to stand and observe \r\na minute of silence in tribute to the memory of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Soe Win. \r\n The members of the General Assembly observed a \r\nminute of silence. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Myanmar. \r\n Mr. Swe (Myanmar): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Myanmar, I wish to express \r\nmy profound gratitude to you for the words of \r\ncondolence expressed on behalf of the General \r\nAssembly on the passing away of His Excellency \r\nGeneral Soe Win, Prime Minister of the Union of \r\nMyanmar. He was a soldier and a statesman who \r\ndevoted his life to the service of his country. He will be \r\nremembered. He was respected by all who came into \r\ncontact with him. His untimely demise has deprived \r\nmy country of a true son.  \r\n The President: I thank the representative of \r\nMyanmar. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 53 \r\n \r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment \r\n \r\n(b)  High-level dialogue for the implementation of \r\nthe outcome of the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development \r\n \r\n  Draft decision (A/62/L.3)  \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take \r\naction on draft decision A/62/L.3, entitled, \r\n“Accreditation of non-governmental organizations to \r\nthe High-Level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment”. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to adopt draft decision A/62/L.3? \r\n The draft decision was adopted. \r\n The President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item \r\n(b) of agenda item 53. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 64 and 47 \r\n \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support \r\n \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 2 \r\n \r\n(a)  New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and international \r\nsupport \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/203) \r\n \r\n(b)  Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/204) \r\n \r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/321) \r\n \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly I wish to welcome the Secretary-General to \r\nthe meeting and to thank him and the World Health \r\nOrganization for their respective reports on each \r\nagenda item.  \r\n The three issues under consideration today are \r\ncentral to the overall work of the United Nations \r\nsystem and the link between them is self-evident. The \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\nwhich is an Africa-owned vision and strategic \r\nframework for the renewal and development of the \r\ncontinent, aims to address the very issues that lie at the \r\nheart of conflict on the continent, namely, the issues of \r\ngovernance and socio-economic development. Durable \r\npeace and sustainable socio-economic development are \r\ninextricably linked. As the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change \r\nrecognized, development is the first line of defence in a \r\ncollective security system. \r\n Eradicating poverty and promoting development \r\nnot only saves lives that would otherwise have been \r\nlost to hunger and disease, it also strengthens the \r\ncapacity of States to ensure durable peace. As we all \r\nknow, disease impedes development. Each year there \r\nare an estimated 350-500 million cases of malaria, \r\nresulting in over one million deaths. Over 90 per cent \r\nof those deaths are in Africa, mostly children under \r\nfive years of age. The annual economic cost due to \r\nmalaria in Africa has been estimated at around \r\n$12 billion. It is difficult to envisage development and, \r\ntherefore, durable peace in Africa under those \r\ncircumstances. \r\n In the fifth consolidated report on progress in \r\nimplementation and international support to NEPAD \r\n(A/62/203), the Secretary-General highlights policy \r\nmeasures and actions taken by African countries and \r\norganizations in the implementation of NEPAD in a \r\nnumber of key areas, including infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, agriculture, health and education. \r\nCommendable progress has been made in those areas. \r\nIn agriculture, for example, progress was made in \r\ntranslating the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme framework into specific \r\nactions, while in the health sector, there was progress \r\nin advancing the African Union/NEPAD health \r\nstrategy. \r\n Clearly there is still a long road ahead. As is \r\nrecognized in the NEPAD principles, African \r\nownership and leadership is critical and must continue \r\nto guide responses to the challenges that lie ahead. The \r\nNEPAD principles also recognize the imperative for \r\nstrong international involvement and partnership. \r\nDuring the reporting period covered in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s fifth report, there was commendable progress \r\nin the response and support of the international \r\ncommunity, particularly in the areas of debt relief, by \r\nextending and deepening debt relief through the \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and other \r\nbilateral debt relief initiatives. The report also \r\nrecognizes a further increase in foreign direct \r\ninvestment (FDI), greater South-South cooperation and \r\nsome progress in market access for trade. The need for \r\nmeasures to accelerate further implementation of \r\ncommitments on official development assistance \r\n(ODA) and trade is also acknowledged. \r\n We also have before us the progress report \r\n(A/62/204) of the Secretary-General on implementation \r\nof the recommendations contained in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa. While we welcome the fact that \r\nthere are fewer conflicts in Africa today than a decade \r\nago, we also recognize that one fifth of the population \r\nof the continent still lives in areas affected by conflict. \r\nThe effectiveness and readiness of the international \r\ncommunity, including African countries, to respond to \r\nconflict on the continent is a major factor in the \r\nimprovement of security. Initiatives by the African \r\nUnion, notably the creation of the African Peace and \r\nSecurity Architecture comprising the African Union \r\nPeace and Security Council, a Panel of the Wise, a \r\ncontinental early warning system and the beginnings of \r\nan African standby force, are all commendable and \r\nshould be encouraged. \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n3 07-55167 \r\n \r\n The continued support of the United Nations \r\nsystem in assisting Africa to address those challenges \r\nis critical. I agree with the Secretary-General that more \r\naction is needed both to strengthen and support \r\nAfrica’s own efforts to bring peace to the continent and \r\nto tackle the wider global sources of armed conflict. I \r\ntherefore welcome his intention to revamp efforts for \r\nUnited Nations support to Africa, including deepening \r\nthe engagement in support of the African Union \r\nthrough capacity-building. \r\n Finally, the report of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) (see A/62/321) reviews \r\ndevelopments in case management and prevention and \r\nprospects for the elimination of malaria. It also \r\naddresses the problems associated with malaria in \r\npregnant women, among other issues. It is most \r\nencouraging that some interventions, such as long-\r\nlasting insecticidal nets, have begun to yield progress \r\nin recent years. We have also witnessed increased \r\naccess to effective case management and coverage with \r\nindoor residual spraying, though this is progressing at a \r\nslower pace.  \r\n Yesterday’s announcement that tests on a malaria \r\nvaccine conducted in Mozambique indicate that the \r\nvaccine is safe and provides a high level of protection \r\nis very promising. This is potentially a ground-\r\nbreaking development in the fight against malaria. \r\nChallenges are significant, particularly the lack of \r\nfunding and a lack of capacity, which act on each other \r\nin a vicious circle and which result in capacities that \r\nfall dramatically short of what is needed to effectively \r\ncombat the disease. Also noted was a shortage of \r\nreliable and accurate data. \r\n I would therefore encourage the General \r\nAssembly and the United Nations system to continue to \r\nwork together to combat that disease. It is unacceptable \r\nthat an entirely preventable disease claims over \r\n1 million lives each year, mostly children. National \r\nprogrammes in malaria-epidemic countries must \r\ncontinue to be implemented and supported, as the \r\ninternational community continues to support the \r\nGlobal Fund, WHO and UNICEF. \r\n The issues before us in this debate call for the \r\nactive involvement of all States and illustrate the \r\nnecessity for Member States to recommit themselves to \r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). To that end, I look forward to the continued \r\nsupport of the General Assembly for my plan to \r\nconvene a leaders meeting on the MDGs during this \r\nsession. \r\n I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\n The Secretary-General: I am pleased to have \r\nthis opportunity to introduce my reports on Africa at \r\nthis important debate on agenda items 47 and 64. I am \r\nalso pleased that the Chief Executive Director of the \r\nsecretariat of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), Mr. Firmino Mucavele, is with \r\nus today. \r\n Since I took office as Secretary-General, Africa \r\nand its special needs have topped my agenda. That is \r\nwhy my first extended official mission overseas took \r\nme to the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, \r\nfollowed by visits to the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, the Republic of the Congo and Kenya. \r\n I have since visited the Sudan to underscore the \r\nUnited Nations commitment to the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement as the cornerstone for peace \r\nthroughout the country and to advance efforts to \r\nresolve the crisis in Darfur. As I have said on many \r\noccasions, peace in Darfur remains my most urgent \r\npriority. We must all work together to ensure the \r\nsuccess of the Darfur peace negotiations commencing \r\nin Libya later this month. For my part, I intend to do \r\neverything I can to bring an end to the intense suffering \r\nin Darfur. \r\n I have also made it a priority to advance our \r\ndevelopment agenda in Africa, especially the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Many African \r\ncountries have made good progress towards the Goals. \r\nBut overall, the continent is not on track to reach those \r\ndevelopment targets by 2015. Just past the midpoint of \r\nour marathon, the challenges remain daunting. Extreme \r\npoverty, reinforced by a lack of access to basic \r\neducation, health care and adequate nutrition, \r\ncontinues to prevent million of talented, promising \r\nyoung Africans from fulfilling their potential. \r\n The status quo is unconscionable for Africa and \r\nfor the world. Changing it requires a strengthened \r\nglobal partnership. It demands shared responsibility. \r\nAnd it needs the implementation of all existing \r\ncommitments. That is why I have established the \r\nMillennium Development Goals Africa Steering Group \r\nto bring together all major multilateral and \r\nintergovernmental development organizations. The aim \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 4 \r\n \r\nis to galvanize international action towards attaining \r\nthe Goals in full, on time and across Africa. \r\n We know that peace, development and human \r\nrights go hand in hand. Fighting extreme poverty is key \r\nto preventing conflict. My progress report on the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of peace and \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/62/204) clearly \r\nacknowledges that reality. It is therefore heartening \r\nthat over the past decade, Africa has made significant \r\nprogress towards ending armed conflict. It has also \r\nprogressed in building its own architecture in support \r\nof conflict prevention, mediation and conflict \r\nresolution, particularly through the African Union. \r\n Conflicts in Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone and \r\nBurundi have come to an end. Fragile peace processes \r\nare being reinforced, largely through African efforts \r\nstrongly supported by the international community. In \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, successful \r\ndemocratic elections have at last taken place. The \r\nUnited Nations is supporting the Government’s efforts \r\nto consolidate State authority in the eastern Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. We are also helping to address \r\nthe serious humanitarian challenges in the Kivus. \r\n As outlined in my report, we must now help \r\nconsolidate the positive changes in Africa through \r\nstronger, more coherent United Nations support, \r\nincluding in the areas of governance and institutional \r\ncapacity-building. We must ensure that the United \r\nNations plays its role to the fullest extent possible \r\nalong the peace continuum, from conflict prevention to \r\npeacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We \r\nmust use all possible resources to support Africa’s \r\ndevelopment and to empower women to strengthen \r\ntheir essential role in the process. And we must do \r\nmore to help Africa deal with the increasing threat \r\nposed by climate change, because we know that poor \r\ncountries stand to bear the brunt of it. \r\n Much has changed since 1998, when my \r\npredecessor prepared the initial report on the causes of \r\nconflict in Africa (A/52/87). The time has come to take \r\nstock of progress made and lessons learned so that we \r\ncan build on the results attained thus far. That is why I \r\nam proposing a comprehensive review of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the 1998 report. As \r\nrequested by the Assembly, my report also includes \r\nproposals for United Nations action in support of the \r\ngoal of achieving a conflict-free Africa by 2010. \r\n In my report on progress in implementation of \r\nand international support for the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (A/62/203), I have provided an \r\noverview of the progress being made in implementing \r\nthe NEPAD blueprint. I have also provided Member \r\nStates with a picture of the multifaceted ways in which \r\nthe United Nations system is working closely with \r\nAfrica and African institutions in the implementation \r\nof NEPAD. \r\n The New Partnership for Africa’s Development is \r\na good example of the resolve demonstrated by \r\nAfricans to take full responsibility for their continent’s \r\nfuture. A growing number of African countries are \r\nparticipating in the African Peer Review Mechanism. \r\nImprovements in governance have been accompanied \r\nby sustained economic growth and better management \r\nof the economies of many African countries. Those \r\ndevelopments underscore the importance of \r\ninternational support for NEPAD as an African-owned \r\nand Africa-driven framework for the region’s future. \r\n In spite of many positive developments, the \r\nspecial needs of Africa remain immense. And today, \r\nthere is no more pressing need than addressing the \r\nfight against the pandemics that continue to ravage the \r\ncontinent. Malaria, AIDS, tuberculosis and other \r\ninfectious diseases are taking their worst social and \r\neconomic toll on countries that can least afford it. They \r\nalso pose threats to peace and stability due to the \r\ndevastation they wreak on capacity and governance. \r\n Malaria alone kills more than one million people \r\nevery year, mostly infants, young children and \r\npregnant women — and most of them in Africa. In its \r\nreport on the Decade to Roll Back Malaria (see \r\nA/62/321), the World Health Organization outlines the \r\nsignificant progress made in the international campaign \r\nagainst this ancient enemy of humanity. We now have \r\nthe tools and increased resources to control malaria. \r\nBut there is no time to waste. Every minute we \r\ndeliberate, another two children die needlessly. Let us \r\nkeep pushing to reverse the incidence of this killer \r\ndisease. \r\n African countries are the first to acknowledge \r\ntheir primary responsibility to tackle Africa’s \r\nproblems. They accept the urgent need to continue to \r\nfight corruption, improve governance, empower \r\nwomen and create jobs. They recognize that tens of \r\nmillions of young people need education, that essential \r\ninfrastructure must be built and that Africa must be \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n5 07-55167 \r\n \r\nable to compete effectively in the world economy. \r\nAfrica’s courageous efforts at reform must continue, \r\nbut the international community must also rise to the \r\nchallenge. \r\n The United Nations has a crucial role to play in \r\nhelping Africa meet its challenges and realize its full \r\npotential. That is why I will do my utmost to further \r\nenhance the Secretariat’s capacity to support our \r\nAfrica-related programmes and efforts.  \r\n I look forward to a substantive and useful debate \r\non these Africa-related agenda items. And I am \r\nconfident that the Assembly will reaffirm its strong \r\npolitical will to assist the Governments and people of \r\nAfrica in their struggle for lasting peace, poverty \r\neradication and sustainable development. \r\n The President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement. \r\n Mr. Akram (Pakistan): May I at the outset \r\nexpress the condolences of the Pakistan delegation on \r\nthe sad demise of the Prime Minister of Myanmar. \r\n I have the honour today to speak on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China on agenda item 64 (a), entitled \r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support”. The \r\nGroup of 77 and China thanks the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report (A/62/203) on that item. There is much \r\nthat has been achieved in Africa since the launch of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), a \r\nsix year-old programme of the African Union. Through \r\nNEPAD, African leaders have taken ownership and \r\nleadership of the continent’s socio-economic renewal \r\nagenda and transformed the content of that agenda. \r\n NEPAD represents the collective determination \r\nand commitment of Africa to place its countries on the \r\nroad to sustainable economic and social development \r\nby taking control of their own development and by \r\nfighting poverty. NEPAD’s policies and priorities have \r\nbecome an acceptable internationally approved \r\nframework for Africa’s development. \r\n Through NEPAD, African leaders have \r\nfundamentally changed the development paradigm. The \r\nnarrow approach of the Poverty Reduction Strategy \r\nPapers has been expanded to include a comprehensive \r\nand holistic approach to development through African \r\nownership. In fact, most African countries now have \r\ntheir own national development strategies. Today, as \r\nwe stand at the halfway point before the target date of \r\n2015 to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), unfortunately, Africa remains the sole \r\ncontinent which is not on track to achieve the Goals. \r\nThe situation is particularly bleak in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica. \r\n If we are to succeed in eradicating poverty and \r\nhunger in Africa, urgent and concerted action by \r\ndeveloped countries and the international community is \r\nimperative. Today, inadequacy of resources is widely \r\nseen as the main constraint on African development. \r\nDespite serious, sincere and consistent efforts by \r\nAfrican countries themselves to implement NEPAD, \r\nAfrica is still far from realizing the levels of support \r\nrequired under that partnership. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is deeply concerned \r\nin particular about the overall decline of official \r\ndevelopment assistance flows, including to Africa, \r\ndespite the promises made by the Group of Eight at \r\nGleneagles in 2005 to double aid to Africa by 2010. \r\n The welcome debt relief under the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative may have released \r\nresources for development-related expenditures in \r\nAfrica, yet they are completely inadequate in helping \r\nAfrican countries to realize the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals including the MDGs. The situation \r\nclearly demands urgent, bold and more encompassing \r\ninitiatives to solve the external debt problems of \r\nAfrican countries.  \r\n The international community should also ensure \r\nthat multilateral trade agreements, including those \r\nwhich will result from the Doha Round, should give \r\npriority to Africa’s needs and incorporate appropriate \r\ndevelopment provisions. Efforts should be made to \r\nensure that the Aid for Trade initiative is formulated in \r\na manner that is adequately funded, efficiently \r\nmanaged and effectively implemented as quickly as \r\npossible. Resources granted to the initiative should be \r\nadditional to existing resources, predictable, adequate \r\nand sustainable.  \r\n Despite record high levels of inflows of \r\n$31 billion in 2005, Africa’s share in global foreign \r\ndirect investment has remained low, at about 3 per \r\ncent. Conscious efforts are thus needed to direct \r\ninvestment flows, particularly infrastructure \r\ninvestments, to support and sustain the development \r\nobjectives of Africa. \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 6 \r\n \r\n The Group of 77 and China is of the view that \r\nresources must be mobilized for African States, the \r\nregional economic communities and the African Union \r\nin order to support efforts aimed at achieving the \r\nMDGs within the framework of national development \r\nprogrammes and at implementing the NEPAD \r\nprogramme. We note the innovative approaches that \r\nhave been developed by some of the institutions \r\nregarding funding and project implementation in \r\npriority areas for NEPAD. \r\n We are pleased that United Nations agencies have \r\norganized themselves into various clusters in line with \r\nNEPAD priority areas as a way to increase \r\ncoordination and cooperation in their work relating to \r\nNEPAD. Additionally, a number of these agencies are \r\nplaying a critical role in supporting the work of \r\nNEPAD. We welcome this important support and we \r\nstill believe that there is need for the United Nations to \r\nmainstream NEPAD into all its normative and \r\noperational activities. \r\n The Group of 77 and China also looks forward to \r\nthe convening of and active participation of all partners \r\nin the high-level meeting on “Africa’s development \r\nneeds: state of implementation of various \r\ncommitments, challenges and the way forward” to be \r\nheld during the sixty-third session of the Assembly. We \r\nwill work with our partners during this session to \r\ndecide on the modalities and scope of the high-level \r\nmeeting in order to make it a success. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to take the floor on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States to talk under item 64, on the New \r\nPartnership for the Development of Africa (NEPAD), \r\non progress in implementation and international \r\nsupport, and on the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa, as well as on item 47 on the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa.  \r\n The African Group would like to express its \r\nsatisfaction to the Secretary-General for his various \r\ndetailed reports and for the support that he continues to \r\nprovide for Africa’s development efforts. We welcome \r\nthe fact that he has drawn attention to the risks \r\ninvolved in pursuing the traditional path that has \r\ntended to lead to the lack of respect for commitments \r\nand to delays in the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration Goals (MDGs) and the implementation of \r\nNEPAD. \r\n In 2001, the African heads of State and \r\nGovernment, convinced that each country bears \r\nprimary responsibility for its own development and \r\nthat African countries should pursue their programmes \r\nof reform, both economic and social, adopted NEPAD \r\nas a framework for development and the reinvigoration \r\nof our continent.  \r\n Through NEPAD, African countries have \r\ncommitted themselves to creating conditions conducive \r\nto economic growth and sustainable development and \r\nto mobilizing the African people so that they can \r\nbecome the main stakeholders in development. The call \r\nlaunched to the rest of the world is to promote \r\ncomplementary action to support African nations in the \r\nimplementation of their own programmes of self-\r\nsufficiency and development. \r\n We can assert that Africa is making progress \r\nalong these lines. The economy is turning around and \r\nkey indicators are improving. NEPAD has launched a \r\nkind of revolution based on a global programme that \r\naims to exploit scientific and technological progress so \r\nas to improve agricultural production. Progress is also \r\nbeing made in the key areas of infrastructure, energy, \r\ninformation technology, communication, transportation, \r\nwater and sanitation. \r\n Recently, NEPAD has undertaken important \r\nefforts in gender equality aimed at implementing \r\nprogrammes capable of giving free rein to the \r\neconomic potential of women, combating poverty, \r\novercoming the gap between men and women, \r\nincreasing women’s economic power and contributing \r\nto the realization of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and sustainable development. \r\n Another important fact is the pace at which the \r\nAfrican countries are acceding to the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism. Today, 26 countries have \r\nvoluntarily signed on to this completely African \r\nmechanism. This confirms, once again, that African \r\ncountries are taking the reforms and transparency very \r\nseriously indeed.  \r\n However, despite all of these achievements, they \r\nare still faced with major challenges to further \r\nprogress, such as HIV/AIDS, capacity-building, the \r\nneed for increased official development assistance, the \r\nneed for foreign direct investment and the need for a \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n7 07-55167 \r\n \r\nbreakthrough in the World Trade Organization (WTO) \r\nnegotiations. \r\n Most African countries are ready to accelerate \r\neconomic and social reforms and to implement \r\nprogrammes of essential development in education, \r\nscience, technology, health and agriculture. However, \r\nas you know, they have neither the capacity, nor the \r\nresources, nor the means to do so. These challenges \r\nmust not be taken lightly. Africa can only make \r\nprogress if it finds appropriate solutions to them. \r\n The question of subsidies accorded by \r\nindustrialized countries to their agricultural sectors is a \r\nmajor concern for the continent of Africa. \r\nUnfortunately, the negotiations within the WTO have \r\nbeen progressing extremely slowly. The developed \r\ncountries are reluctant to take the necessary steps. They \r\nknow that their policies are not compatible with the \r\npositions that they defend in international proceedings. \r\nThey know that African farmers are becoming poorer \r\nand poorer, even though they are working harder and \r\nharder. Moreover, although the developed countries \r\nknow that these subsidies undermine the poorest \r\ncountries, they do not have the political courage to \r\nadmit the truth and act appropriately. African countries \r\nknow that they have to improve intra-African trade and \r\nNEPAD gives high priority to this issue, as it is a \r\nfundamental factor in helping African countries to \r\nachieve sustainable development. \r\n Therefore, we welcome the call made by the \r\nSecretary-General to the development partners of \r\nAfrica, calling upon them to honour their \r\ncommitments. We welcome the fact that he asked \r\ndonors and trade partners to open up access to markets \r\nand to reschedule international aid, so that African \r\nproducts and services can benefit from equitable \r\nopportunities. The partners supporting African \r\ndevelopment should translate their commitments into \r\ntrue development assistance. It is regrettable that the \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) that the \r\nDevelopment Assistance Committee provides to Africa, \r\napart from debt relief measures, dropped in real terms \r\nin 2005 and stagnated in 2006.  \r\n We welcome with satisfaction the progress \r\naccomplished in debt relief for indebted African \r\ncountries. However, more remains to be done to free \r\nAfrica from the debt burden that has sapped its \r\ndevelopment efforts over decades. Here, while \r\nrecognizing the efforts of the Group of Eight (G-8), the \r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \r\nand other bilateral donors, we would stress the fact that \r\nAfrica needs nothing less than 100 per cent debt \r\ncancellation.  \r\n African countries welcome recent developments \r\nin South-South cooperation. We are convinced that \r\nSouth-South cooperation is mobilizing essential \r\nresources to optimize its potential through sharing \r\nknow-how with the goal of promoting the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our continent.  \r\n African countries have been at the forefront of \r\ndeciding upon their own destiny. The African Union, \r\nwith the support of the main African countries, has \r\nassumed a key role in seeking ways to settle conflicts \r\nand has refused to recognize unconstitutional changes \r\nof Government. Strong, new leadership is emerging; \r\nthis is supported by the emergence of a better \r\norganized civil society.  \r\n We take note of the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nthe implementation of recommendations on the causes \r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/62/204). Despite \r\nthe fact that the report indicates that the major \r\nhandicaps to the consolidation of peace and \r\ndevelopment persist owing to extreme poverty, weak \r\ngovernmental institutions, the poor management of \r\nnatural resources, the insufficient protection of \r\nfundamental human rights and increased threats linked \r\nto climate change, Africa still attaches great \r\nimportance to questions of peace and security. there \r\ncan be no development without peace; there can be no \r\ndevelopment without security.  \r\n Thus, the African Union has promised that it will \r\nattack the conflicts and the political instability in \r\nAfrica so as to rid the continent of all conflicts by \r\n2010. The decision of heads of State and Government \r\nwas taken at the Sirte Summit. The Peace and Security \r\nCouncil of the African Union continues to play an \r\nimportant role in the prevention and resolution of \r\nconflicts throughout the continent. Here, we welcome \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations to work in \r\ncooperation with the African Union to assist us in \r\nstrengthening capacity-building in the sphere of \r\npeacekeeping.  \r\n The African Union is endeavouring to tackle the \r\nchallenges confronted by its States and peoples \r\nemerging from conflict situations. The programme \r\nentitled Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 8 \r\n \r\nis one the African Union’s tools to help reduce the \r\nharshness and frequency of relapses into conflict \r\nsituations, as well as to promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment. That African Union programme has also \r\nendeavoured to complement the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission by identifying those States \r\nthat risk falling back into conflict by providing them \r\nwith appropriate, timely and effective assistance. They \r\nare helping to reduce the rate at which those countries \r\ntorn apart by war slide back into conflict. The Post-\r\nConflict Reconstruction and Development programme \r\nunderscores the fact that the strategy of post-conflict \r\nrebuilding is a long-term one by its very nature. This \r\nstrategy must be decided upon by the African \r\ncommunities and States themselves.  \r\n I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on \r\nhis extensive report on the efforts made to contain and \r\nreverse the spread of the most murderous disease on \r\nthe continent: malaria. Since the beginning of Decade \r\nto Roll Back Malaria, we have seen significant steps \r\ntaken by both the international community and by \r\nAfrican Governments themselves. Partnerships have \r\nexpanded to include local organizations, civil society \r\nand individual households.  \r\n Africa needs the international resources of the \r\nGlobal Fund to fight malaria. We are very grateful \r\nindeed to all of our partners for their solidarity and for \r\ntheir support; however, much remains to be done. The \r\nissue of impregnated mosquito nets to be distributed to \r\nall households is still an issue of serious concern for \r\nthe African Governments and people themselves. Even \r\nthough we can see progress in that we are seeing a drop \r\nin maternal and infant mortality and morbidity in many \r\ncountries, we still need to strengthen this partnership. \r\nIt is important to make sure that there are sufficient \r\nfunds available so that African countries continue with \r\nthe same determination to lead this victorious fight \r\nagainst this scourge that has already hampered Africa’s \r\neconomic and social development. A sick citizen in a \r\ncountry is not an efficient economic actor. This is the \r\nsituation and we need to bear that in mind.  \r\n To conclude, I would say that time is passing and \r\nthat it is not favouring Africa. Africa calls for action; \r\nmany challenges still need to be tackled: the \r\nconsolidation of democracy, good governance and \r\ndurable economic growth throughout the continent. \r\nThe fact that the international community is not \r\nresponding to the pressing needs to finance Africa \r\nconstitutes for us and for the whole of the African \r\ncontinent a huge source of disappointment. Africa has \r\ndemonstrated its commitment and works to establish \r\ninstitutions and subregional groups that play a key role \r\nin the realization of the objectives of regional \r\nintegration. Africa also works to ensure the optimal \r\nutilization of the resources of the different areas of \r\nAfrica.  \r\n Africa is impatiently awaiting the appointment \r\nfor the new Special Adviser on Africa in the context of \r\nthe reforms proposed by the Secretary-General. These \r\nactivities are very important to promoting the interests \r\nof the African continent here within the United \r\nNations. \r\n There is no doubt that in order for development to \r\nmake progress, Africa needs key individuals to deal \r\nwith these issues within the Secretariat of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n Mr. Godinho (Portugal): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\ncandidate countries Croatia, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro, Serbia, as well as Ukraine, the Republic \r\nof Moldova, Armenia and Georgia, align themselves \r\nwith this statement. \r\n For the sake of efficiency, and in order to save \r\ntime, I will shorten my oral statement today. The full \r\ntext has been distributed.  \r\n First of all, the European Union wishes to \r\ncongratulate its African partners on the sixth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). As in previous years, \r\nthe European Union welcomes today’s Africa debate in \r\nthe United Nations General Assembly and welcomes \r\nthe opportunity to address three key items, namely, \r\nNEPAD, peace and security aspects and the fight \r\nagainst malaria on the African continent. \r\n I will start with NEPAD. Africa is one of the \r\nmain points of focus of the European Union’s \r\ndevelopment policy. The EU continues to support the \r\nNEPAD initiative, which provides an appropriate basis \r\nfor the partnership between the international \r\ncommunity and African nations. We can surely state \r\nthat, thanks to NEPAD, democratic and accountable \r\ngovernance is gaining ground on the African continent. \r\nThis is most clearly shown by the growing number of \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n9 07-55167 \r\n \r\nmultiparty elections, more representative and effective \r\nlegislatures, improved space for civil society and the \r\nadoption of policy milestones, such as the January \r\n2007 African Charter on Democracy, Elections and \r\nGovernance. \r\n The European Union will continue to support \r\nthese processes at the institutional and field levels, as it \r\nis already doing, for example with its assistance to \r\nelectoral observer missions in many African countries. \r\n One of the most significant results of NEPAD \r\nactivities, however, is the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism. The EU is pleased to note that, as of June \r\n2007, 26 countries have voluntarily acceded to this \r\nentirely African-owned process. The EU has been \r\nfollowing the activities of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism with great interest in 2007 and is pleased \r\nthat the Mechanism, an African way to good \r\ngovernance, has encouraged countries to adopt policy \r\nmeasures to strengthen accountability and \r\ntransparency. \r\n However, key challenges remain in the \r\nimplementation of projects and programmes identified \r\nin national programmes of action. The EU is, therefore, \r\nwilling to support countries that are tackling the \r\nproblems identified in the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism process. \r\n The EU strongly supports the orientation of the \r\nmember States of the African Union, confirmed at the \r\nhighest level on the occasion of the Accra meeting of \r\nheads of State and Government, to proceed steadily \r\ntowards the objective of economic and institutional \r\nintegration, which, as shown by the EU’s own \r\nexperience, is an invaluable asset for ensuring stability \r\nand development. \r\n Africa is at the heart of the EU’s development \r\npolicy. The African continent has great potential, as \r\nevidenced by its people, its culture and its economic \r\nand political successes during the last decade. But \r\nAfrica also has its continuing problems. Poverty is not \r\njust a concept in Africa — it is a reality. Armed \r\nconflicts, failing States, lack of economic development, \r\ninadequate social infrastructure, poor standards of \r\neducation, environmental degradation and the \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic are depressing its standard of \r\nliving. \r\n As far as official development assistance (ODA) \r\nis concerned, the European Council reiterated in \r\nBrussels in June 2005 that the EU would intensify its \r\nefforts to fulfil the commitments undertaken in \r\nMonterrey, including through the exploration of \r\ninnovative sources of financing. The EU, which is \r\nalready the world’s main purveyor of development, \r\nwith over 50 per cent of the total, has collectively \r\nagreed to increase its ODA to 0.56 per cent of its gross \r\nnational income by 2010, and to 0.7 per cent by 2015. \r\n The European Union stands ready to assist with \r\nits commitment to ODA and debt relief. The resolution \r\nof Africa’s external debt problem is critical for the \r\nsustainable development of the African countries. The \r\nUnion remains committed to the extended Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) and the \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative to help eligible \r\ncountries reach and maintain a sustainable level of debt \r\nin order for them to reinforce poverty reduction efforts \r\nand promote growth. \r\n By 2008, European Union economic partnership \r\nagreements with four African, Caribbean and Pacific \r\nregions in Africa will enter into force, thus promoting \r\nregional integration and a comprehensive approach to \r\ntackling barriers to trade and to attracting investors. \r\nThe EU has taken its Africa Strategy as a starting point \r\nfor the programming of relevant EU aid instruments. \r\nWe would also like to highlight the 10th European \r\nDevelopment Fund, with funds that amount to \r\n22.7 billion euros for the period 2008-2013, 90 per cent \r\nof which will be allocated to sub-Saharan Africa. \r\nMoreover, the European Union and Africa have \r\ndecided to further strengthen the ties linking both \r\ncontinents by developing a co-owned joint strategy \r\nreflecting the needs and aspirations of the peoples of \r\nAfrica and Europe. In that connection, we are heading \r\ntowards a second EU-Africa Summit, scheduled to \r\nplace in Lisbon at the end of 2007. \r\n On the subject of the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa, I would like to say that Africa \r\ntoday is afflicted by far fewer armed conflicts than it \r\nwas a decade ago, but one fifth of the population of the \r\ncontinent still lives in areas affected by conflict. There \r\nhas been considerable progress over the past few years. \r\nToday, while conflicts in Somalia, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the Darfur region of the \r\nSudan are cause for concern, other conflicts, such as \r\nthe civil wars in Angola, Sierra Leone and Liberia, \r\nhave been resolved; and many other conflicts are in the \r\ncourse of being settled. \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 10 \r\n \r\n The EU expresses its deep concern about the \r\nsecurity and humanitarian situation in Darfur and \r\ncondemns the continuing violations of the ceasefire. \r\nThe EU actively supports the transition from the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in Sudan to the African Union-\r\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and calls \r\nupon all parties to participate constructively at the \r\nDarfur peace negotiations to begin on 27 October. The \r\nEU also calls upon the parties to the 2005 \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement to implement the \r\nAgreement in full and in good faith. \r\n Furthermore, we would like to expresses our \r\nconcern over the security and humanitarian situation in \r\nSomalia and eastern Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. \r\n Numerous actions have been taken by the EU in \r\nthe area of peace and security in Africa. Under the \r\nAfrican Peace Facility, around €300 million have been \r\nprovided to support the Africa Union Mission in the \r\nSudan; while the operation in the Central African \r\nRepublic led by the Central African Economic and \r\nMonetary Community was supported with over \r\n€23 million and the African Union Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM) with another €15 million. A number of \r\ncapacity-building programmes have been launched as \r\nwell. The initial funding for the African Peace  \r\nFacility — €250 million — was raised to a total of \r\n€385 million.  \r\n The EU welcomes the role of the United Nations \r\nin preventive diplomacy and reiterates its support for \r\nthe Summit Outcome conclusion that each individual \r\nState has the responsibility to protect its population \r\nfrom genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \r\ncrimes against humanity. \r\n The EU condemns all forms of sexual violence \r\nand underscores the importance of integrating a gender \r\nperspective and the protection of children into conflict \r\nprevention. Urgent preventive measures should be \r\ndeveloped, especially in relation to gender-based \r\nviolence in conflicts. \r\n The EU also supports the strengthening of fragile \r\nStates, as well as disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration (DDR), together with security-sector \r\nreform programmes, in African States. In that context, \r\nwe welcome the second International Conference on \r\nDDR and Stability in Africa, which was held in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in June 2007. \r\n Conflict prevention and reconstruction efforts in \r\nAfrica go hand-in-hand with the building of durable \r\npeace and the promotion of economic growth. The new \r\nInstrument for Stability therefore combines short-term \r\nmeasures in situations of political crisis or natural \r\ndisaster and long-term activities in a stable context \r\naimed at mitigating threats that could fuel conflicts. \r\nInitiatives that are currently planned or being \r\nimplemented this year include support for security-\r\nsector reform in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, accompanying measures to AMISOM in \r\nSomalia and the support for the Juba peace talks in \r\nUganda.  \r\n Increasingly, countries on the continent are \r\nholding democratic elections. The EU has played a key \r\nrole in the peaceful completion of presidential \r\nelections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nSierra Leone.  \r\n Africa is moving in the direction of economic \r\nprosperity, with a 6 per cent growth rate expected in \r\n2007. \r\n The rule of law has become the centrepiece of all \r\npolicymaking processes. Twenty-nine African countries \r\nare now parties to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court. \r\n The EU is fully engaged in post-conflict \r\nreconstruction in Africa and supports, in particular, the \r\nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Commission. The \r\nCommission provides an agreed framework for \r\nmonitoring commitments from the country under \r\nconsideration, the Commission and other partners and \r\nfor ensuring greater coherence and coordination of \r\nefforts. The EU has for many years provided \r\nconsiderable input for peacebuilding activities in \r\nAfrica and elsewhere in the world. The Union is ready \r\nto continue its commitments by actively supporting the \r\nwork of the Peacebuilding Commission in the two \r\nAfrican countries inscribed on its agenda, namely, \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone. \r\n Let me focus my remaining comments on the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria. \r\n Health is inextricably linked to development. It is \r\na fundamental element in reducing poverty and in \r\npromoting human security. After many years of \r\nimpressive gains in human health worldwide, we are \r\nnow in a situation where countries are unable to cope \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n11 07-55167 \r\n \r\nwith the burden that disease poses to their health \r\nsystems.  \r\n Malaria disproportionately affects poor people, \r\nwith almost 60 per cent of malaria cases occurring \r\namong the poorest 20 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation. The disease also exacerbates the poverty of \r\npoor countries and communities, through its significant \r\neffects on long-term economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. As indicated in the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) report, which was transmitted by \r\nthe Secretary-General in document A/62/321, evidence \r\nshows that malaria keeps poor people poor — costing \r\nAfrica $12 billion per year in lost gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP). \r\n There are, however, positive signs. There is \r\nevidence that cases of malaria have decreased in seven \r\nAfrican countries. South Africa is a success story, and \r\nso is Swaziland. The EU takes note with great \r\nappreciation of those positive developments. \r\n The EU will support endeavours to ensure access \r\nto effective antimalarial drugs. The Global Fund to \r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, whose budget \r\nreceives support from European Union member States, \r\nhas financed a massive campaign for the distribution of \r\ninsecticide-treated bed nets in Africa, which the \r\nEuropean Union hopes will result in a substantial \r\nreduction in malaria cases and deaths, in particular \r\namong children under the age of five. While attempting \r\nto stimulate research and development so as to lower \r\nthe prices of new drugs and to enhance procurement \r\nand distribution, it is also crucial to closely monitor the \r\nimpact of both new treatments and problems relating to \r\ndrug resistance and to strengthen community \r\nknowledge — including encouraging access to long-\r\nlasting insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual \r\nspraying, in accordance with the rules of the \r\nStockholm Convention, and other preventive and \r\nawareness-enhancing measures. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that Africa needs \r\npeace and stability and that the European Union is fully \r\ncommitted to helping Africa to reach that goal. Our \r\nrelationship, which is conducted in a spirit of equal \r\npartnership, is also based on firm and shared \r\ncommitments to democracy, the promotion of human \r\nrights, good governance and respect for the rule of law, \r\nmutual respect and accountability. \r\n Mr. Cheok (Singapore): May I also express my \r\ncondolences on the passing away of the Prime Minister \r\nof Myanmar.  \r\n I have the honour to speak today on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nwhose member countries are Brunei Darussalam, \r\nCambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, \r\nSingapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. ASEAN also aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nPakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Six years have passed since the adoption of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nIt has become the key mechanism through which \r\nmultilateral financial institutions and development \r\npartners seek to engage Africa. The Secretary General’s \r\nfifth consolidated report on progress in implementation \r\nand international support (A/62/203) notes forward \r\nmovement in key areas, such as infrastructure, \r\nagriculture, health, education and information \r\ntechnology. Those trends indicate the good work that \r\nhas been done through NEPAD. \r\n But Africa still faces daunting challenges. The \r\nreport reminds us that African countries are behind \r\nschedule in meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) by 2015. Without concerted \r\ninternational support, there is a real danger that Africa \r\nwill continue to lag behind, despite the best efforts of \r\nits leaders and peoples. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to help bring those \r\ncountries back on track, including through the \r\nconvening of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nAfrica Steering Group. \r\n Leadership and accountability are key factors for \r\nsustainable development. ASEAN sees the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism as an innovative instrument for \r\npromoting good governance. This is not about \r\nrecrimination; this is about assistance and support. We \r\nare encouraged by the growing enthusiasm among \r\nNEPAD countries for that initiative. According to the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, 26 countries have \r\nvoluntarily acceded to the Review Mechanism. That is \r\na positive sign. \r\n NEPAD is a regional initiative, but in this \r\nglobalized world none of us can go it alone. While the \r\nprimary responsibility for change obviously rests with \r\nAfrica, the international community should also \r\nsupport these efforts. For instance, several members of \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 12 \r\n \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nhave contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. Thailand has contributed \r\n$1 million annually to the Fund since 2003. We also \r\nwelcome the decision of the Group of Eight countries \r\nat the 2007 Heiligendamm Summit to dedicate \r\n$30 billion to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis in Africa.  \r\n But more must be done if the Group of Eight is to \r\nmeet its commitment of doubling aid to Africa by \r\n2010. It is also worrying that, according to the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, official development \r\nassistance (ODA) flows to Africa are declining despite \r\npledges of support. This is about credibility. Donors \r\nshould live up to their stated commitments. \r\n There is a long history between Africa and Asia. \r\nThe first Asia-Africa summit was held in Bandung, \r\nIndonesia, in 1955. In fact, leaders of both regions \r\nmarked the fiftieth anniversary of the summit two \r\nyears ago, again in Indonesia, by agreeing on a \r\ndeclaration to focus cooperation on three pillars: \r\npolitical, economic, and social and cultural relations. \r\nActivities are being pursued via the New Asian-African \r\nStrategic Partnership in areas such as like capacity-\r\nbuilding, environmental law and policy, preservation of \r\ngenetic resources and traditional knowledge, and the \r\ndevelopment of small and medium-sized enterprises. \r\nASEAN considers this initiative to be an excellent \r\nexample of South-South cooperation.  \r\n Another concrete outcome is the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement Centre for South-South Technical \r\nCooperation in Jakarta, which was initiated by \r\nIndonesia and Brunei Darussalam in 1995. The Centre \r\npromotes the exchange and dissemination of \r\ndevelopment experiences through technical assistance \r\nand training. \r\n Individually, ASEAN members have also \r\nstrengthened their relations with NEPAD countries. \r\nTrade between the regions has grown in volume and \r\nnow encompasses an ever-growing list of products and \r\nservices. Both ASEAN and NEPAD have a common \r\ninterest in the early conclusion of a successful Doha \r\nRound. It is clear that trade barriers imposed on \r\ndeveloping-country products are a huge handicap to \r\neconomic development.  \r\n ASEAN countries have also sought to share \r\ndevelopment experiences with our African friends \r\nthrough our respective cooperation programmes. \r\nSeveral ASEAN members, my country included, have \r\nprovided assistance in areas such as education, human \r\nresource development and health, particularly \r\nHIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. We have done \r\nthis through study visits and training programmes. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that all of us in \r\nASEAN will continue to work closely with NEPAD \r\ncountries to achieve our common development goals. \r\n Mr. Nguyen Tat Thanh (Viet Nam): First of all, \r\nI wish to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\nentitled “New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nfifth consolidated report on progress in implementation \r\nand international support” (A/62/203), which \r\nhighlights progress made so far towards the realization \r\nof Africa’s aspiration to eradicating hunger and poverty \r\nand attaining sustainable development and durable \r\npeace, and which focuses on the special needs of Africa \r\nregarding the implementation of the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements just made by the representative of Pakistan \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by the \r\nrepresentative of Singapore on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). We \r\nalso strongly support the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Benin on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States.  \r\n This year marks the midpoint towards the target \r\ndate for attaining the MDGs. We are delighted to \r\nwitness some encouraging progress made by African \r\nStates in their struggle for lasting peace, poverty \r\neradication, HIV/AIDS prevention and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. More African countries are participating \r\nin the African Peer Review Mechanism, which enables \r\nthem to improve their political, economic and social \r\nperformance.  \r\n Despite these positive developments, however, \r\nthere remain enormous challenges facing African \r\nStates in their endeavours to achieve the MDGs. The \r\ncontinent continues to lag behind the rest of the \r\ndeveloping world and has not yet achieved the target of \r\n6 per cent growth in gross national product per annum \r\nestablished by the United Nations New Agenda for the \r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. Moreover, Africa \r\nis known to have the lowest share of global foreign \r\ndirect investment flows, to shoulder growing debt \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n13 07-55167 \r\n \r\nburdens and to seriously lack adequate resources for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Viet Nam holds that, in response to the daunting \r\nmagnitude of these challenges the international \r\ncommunity should strengthen global partnership to \r\nprovide African States with support and assistance in \r\ntheir efforts to reach the MDGs, including through \r\nmore and better aid for trade, further debt relief and \r\ncancellation, and improved market access for African \r\nproducts. In this regard, Viet Nam fully supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s decision to establish the \r\nMillennium Development Goal Africa Steering Group, \r\nwhich calls for international support for Africa’s \r\nimplementation of the Goals, and notes with pleasure \r\nthat the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative have been \r\ncomplemented by bilateral debt relief efforts of the \r\nGroup of Eight and other donor countries. \r\n It is also worth restating that the Aid for Trade \r\ninitiative performs a vital role in bringing additional \r\nresources to scale up investments necessary for African \r\nStates to achieve the MDGs. Viet Nam is of the view \r\nthat, by enabling better use of trading opportunities and \r\nfacilitating trade flows, the Aid for Trade initiative has \r\ngreat potential for accelerating growth in Africa. \r\nHowever, we should not consider Aid for Trade to be \r\nan isolated response to the trading challenges facing \r\nAfrican countries, but rather to be part of the ongoing \r\neffort to build a global partnership for development, in \r\nwhich South-South and North-South cooperation are \r\nboth of paramount importance.  \r\n In this connection, Viet Nam welcomes the \r\nongoing initiatives and partnerships being undertaken \r\nby the Special Unit for South-South Cooperation at the \r\nsubregional, regional, interregional and global levels \r\ntowards establishing public-private partnership \r\nmechanisms aimed at enhancing and expanding South-\r\nSouth cooperation, including triangular cooperation in \r\ntrade and investment. \r\n Over the past years, the scope of cooperation \r\nbetween Viet Nam and its African brothers and sisters \r\nhas been expanded bilaterally and in the South-South \r\ncooperation framework in areas ranging from \r\nagriculture, industry and science and technology to \r\nhealth care, education and environmental protection. \r\nViet Nam has signed numerous cooperation agreements \r\nand projects with African States, such as the agriculture \r\ncooperation project with Mozambique, under the \r\nsponsorship of the Japan International Cooperation \r\nAgency; the tripartite cooperation project between \r\nViet Nam, France and Mali; and the project on lessons \r\nlearned from economic development and poverty \r\neradication in Viet Nam, with the participation of \r\nViet Nam, Benin and the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations. Driven by a \r\ndynamism of mutual interest, Viet Nam’s two-way \r\ntrade volume with Africa grew manyfold between 1991 \r\nand 2006, from just $15 million to approximately \r\n$1 billion last year. \r\n Let me conclude by reaffirming that \r\nstrengthening all-sided relations with Africa continues \r\nto be a cornerstone of Viet Nam’s foreign policy. We \r\nshall continue to explore ways and means to further \r\ncontribute to the successful implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. \r\n Mr. Mori (Japan): Allow me to join previous \r\nspeakers in thanking the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report (A/62/203) on progress in the \r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). Japan also commends the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa, the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa and other bodies of the United \r\nNations system for their tireless efforts for African \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are approaching the midpoint towards 2015, \r\nthe target year for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Many African countries \r\nare making strides towards the Goals, but they still face \r\nmany daunting challenges. Japan believes that the \r\ninternational community must stand behind African \r\ncountries and support their efforts to take charge of \r\ntheir development. \r\n Japan is dedicated to helping African countries \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Next \r\nyear, Japan will co-organize the fourth Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development \r\n(TICAD IV) in May with the United Nations, the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and \r\nthe World Bank, and will host the Group of Eight (G-8) \r\nHokkaido-Toyako Summit in July. We are determined \r\nto utilize the momentum generated by these two events \r\nto mobilize international support for African \r\ndevelopment and African countries’ efforts to achieve \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n As an initiative created, led, implemented and \r\nmonitored by African countries, the New Partnership \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 14 \r\n \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) deserves special \r\nrecognition for its contribution to effective and \r\nsustainable development in Africa. Japan has \r\ncooperated with and supported NEPAD since its \r\nbeginning in 2001. Through regular consultations \r\nbetween Japan and the NEPAD secretariat, led by its \r\nChief Executive, Mr. Firmino Mucavele, several areas \r\nhave been designated as priority areas for cooperation \r\nfor the foreseeable future. These include infrastructure; \r\nagriculture; trade and investment and private sector \r\ndevelopment; and human resources development. \r\nRecently, Japan and the NEPAD secretariat agreed to \r\nadd the environment as the fifth priority sector of \r\nJapan’s support to NEPAD, in response to the concerns \r\nabout climate change expressed by African countries at \r\nthe TICAD Ministerial Conference on Energy and \r\nEnvironment for Sustainable Development, held in \r\nNairobi, Kenya, last March, and the second meeting of \r\nthe NEPAD-Japan Dialogue, held in South Africa last \r\nAugust. \r\n Japan’s support for NEPAD takes various forms, \r\nas indicated in paragraph 57 of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/62/203). Bilateral and subregional \r\nprojects in the aforementioned priority areas are being \r\ndeveloped, including six infrastructure projects that \r\nJapan has selected for funding from NEPAD’s short-\r\nterm action plan. Meanwhile, Japan is moving steadily \r\ntowards its goal of doubling its official development \r\nassistance to Africa by the end of this year while \r\nmobilizing the knowledge and resources of the \r\ninternational community to assist Africa in the areas of \r\nboosting economic growth, ensuring human security \r\nand addressing environmental issues and climate \r\nchange. Japan believes that TICAD IV will further the \r\naims of NEPAD and contribute to making Africa a \r\nvibrant continent of hope and opportunity. On the \r\nsubject of peace consultations, Japan, as Chairman of \r\nthe United Nations Peacebuilding Commission, will \r\ncontribute to various peacebuilding activities in Africa. \r\n Japan agrees with the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on NEPAD that free trade and debt relief are \r\ncrucial for the sustainable development of Africa. The \r\nobjective of poverty reduction through economic \r\ngrowth has long been one of the pillars of Japan’s \r\ndevelopment cooperation with Africa, along with the \r\nconsolidation of peace and human-centred \r\ndevelopment. As its contribution to the Aid for Trade \r\ninitiative, Japan has been steadily implementing the \r\ndevelopment initiative launched in 2005 to help \r\ndeveloping countries reap the benefits of free trade by \r\nbuilding their capacity to export goods. \r\n Regarding debt relief, the Government of Japan \r\nhas implemented the Cologne debt initiative and has \r\nthus far contributed about $3.4 billion to the \r\n18 countries in Africa eligible for the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative. \r\n Turning now to agenda item 47, I would like to \r\nconvey to the Secretary-General my delegation’s \r\nsincere appreciation for his report (A/62/321) on the \r\nprogress brought about by the international response to \r\nmalaria. It has been almost a decade since the Roll \r\nBack Malaria Partnership was established by the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO), the World Bank, UNICEF \r\nand UNDP. Yet, malaria continues to threaten 107 \r\ncountries and territories and at least 40 per cent of the \r\nworld’s population. More than 500 million people still \r\nsuffer from acute malaria, and 1 million lose their lives \r\nto it every year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report stresses the \r\nimportance of both early diagnosis and effective \r\ntreatment, especially the parasitological-based confirmation \r\nand standardized artemisinin-based combination therapies \r\n(ACTs), which WHO recommends. According to the \r\nreport, 75 countries have implemented a monitoring \r\nsystem using a national sentinel site network, and more \r\nthan 60 of the 82 countries where falciparum malaria is \r\nendemic have shifted their anti-malarial drug policies \r\naway from the use of monotherapy to ACTs. Japan is \r\nencouraged that there has been a change for the better \r\nin so many places around the world as a result of the \r\nRoll Back Malaria Partnership. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General also points \r\nout the importance of prevention and of the recent shift \r\nin WHO’s guidance towards the use of insecticide-\r\ntreated mosquito nets. For its part, Japan has \r\ncommitted itself to distributing 10 million long-lasting \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets in Africa. As of \r\nAugust this year, 9.5 million nets had been  \r\ndistributed — enough to prevent the deaths of 150,000 \r\nAfrican children, according to one estimate by \r\nUNICEF. Japan has also contributed $660 million to \r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria, which has allocated 24 per cent of its funding \r\nto combating malaria. At the international level, the \r\nGlobal Fund accounts for 64 per cent of international \r\nfunding commitments for malaria. \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n15 07-55167 \r\n \r\n Health is one of the most important elements of \r\nhuman security. In June 2005, Japan launched its \r\nHealth and Development Initiative, which promotes \r\nJapan’s comprehensive aid approach as a means of \r\nachieving the three health-related MDGs — that is, \r\nGoals 4, 5 and 6. As part of this initiative, Japan will \r\nhelp developing countries control the spread of \r\ninfectious diseases such as malaria. I assure the \r\nAssembly that Japan, through these and other efforts, \r\nwill continue to improve the quality of the global \r\nresponse to malaria by working as a responsible \r\npartner alongside developing countries. \r\n In closing, I would like to reaffirm Japan’s \r\ncommitment to supporting African countries in a \r\nmanner that fully respects their ownership and \r\nleadership. Japan will continue to support NEPAD as a \r\nmeans of achieving a better future for Africa. \r\n Mr. Al-Najem (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\ndelegation of Kuwait is pleased to participate in this \r\ndebate on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). We read with great interest the \r\nfifth consolidated report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe progress in the implementation of and international \r\nsupport for NEPAD (A/62/203). Kuwait attaches \r\nspecial importance to this subject because it is linked \r\nto our concerns and interests on the African continent, \r\nwith which we share close historical ties. \r\n Six years have passed since African leaders \r\nadopted the NEPAD initiative, which aims to achieve \r\nbalanced large-scale growth, enabling Africa to \r\nalleviate poverty and become better integrated into the \r\nworld economy. Kuwait hopes that decisions adopted \r\nat many international conferences to promote \r\nsustainable development will lay the foundations of \r\ntrue partnership between developed and developing \r\ncountries. This could contribute to the stability and \r\ndevelopment of economic relations by laying fair and \r\nbalanced foundations for international trade, in which \r\neach party assumes its responsibilities to meet Africa’s \r\nspecial needs. \r\n The NEPAD initiative bolstered a principle in \r\nwhich we have always believed: that of the close link \r\nbetween successful development and political stability. \r\nHere we pay tribute to the efforts of African countries \r\nin incorporating the priorities of NEPAD in their \r\nnational policies and development planning while \r\nendeavouring to establish firm institutional systems \r\nand mechanisms that will guarantee the success of the \r\ninitiative.  \r\n African countries are striving to break the vicious \r\ncircle of debt. Ensuring that they have the financial \r\nresources they need for their development goals is one \r\nof the most significant challenges facing us. Some \r\nhighly indebted African countries have benefited from \r\nthe cancelling of bilateral debts announced by some \r\ndonor countries, including the Multilateral Debt Relief \r\nInitiative, the Group of Eight commitments announced \r\nat the United Kingdom Summit in 2005 and Highly \r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative originally \r\nproposed by the World Bank and the International \r\nMonetary Fund. Together, they offer a reduction of \r\nalmost $70 billion in the debt of African countries, \r\nwhich represents an average savings of $2 billion every \r\nyear in debt-servicing costs. That cancellation is a \r\npositive step and has drawn Kuwait’s attention.  \r\n Kuwait was one of the first countries to work to \r\nalleviate Africa’s debt burden, long before the \r\nannouncement of the NEPAD initiative. That was \r\nillustrated in the address by the late Emir of Kuwait, \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber \r\nAl-Sabah, to the General Assembly at its forty-third \r\nsession, in 1988, in which he called upon the \r\ninternational community, especially donor countries, to \r\ntake action to lighten the debt burden encumbering the \r\neconomies of developing countries and to cancel debts \r\nfor countries with economies in difficulty. The Kuwait \r\nFund for Economic Development has contributed to \r\nalleviating the burden of foreign debt for African \r\ncountries in the framework of the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative. Those debts were \r\nrescheduled over a period of 40 years, on very \r\nfavourable terms. Here, we wish to reaffirm the content \r\nof the fifth report of the Secretary-General on progress \r\nin the implementation of and international support for \r\nNEPAD. The report calls upon African Governments to \r\nadopt wise debt policies while pursuing capacity-\r\nbuilding and debt management. Countries must remain \r\nvigilant about financing conditions, particularly when \r\nthese involve income from exports. We must not \r\nsimply cancel or alleviate debt without providing funds \r\nfor development assistance.  \r\n  Mr. Soborun (Mauritius), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Kuwait is proud to have abided by all of its \r\ninternational obligations in contributing to economic \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 16 \r\n \r\ndevelopment programmes in developing countries \r\nthrough the Kuwait Fund for Economic Development. \r\nThe Fund has granted development loans of $12 billion \r\nto more than 100 countries around the world, 40 per \r\ncent of which are African countries. Last August, \r\nKuwait announced a gift of $300 million to the Islamic \r\nDevelopment Bank, to fight poverty in Africa. \r\n The Kuwait Fund has contributed to many \r\ndifferent development institutions in Africa, including \r\nthe African Development Fund, the African \r\nDevelopment Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic \r\nDevelopment in Africa. The Fund has also contributed \r\nto many rehabilitation programmes, including more \r\nthan $100 million to 11 African countries to fight river \r\nblindness. Its contribution continued on through the \r\nfifth phase of that initiative, in 2003, which included \r\nadditional African countries. We have contributed \r\neffectively to many development projects in \r\ndeveloping countries through the Organization of the \r\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for \r\nInternational Development. The total of soft loans \r\nreached $5.4 billion last year. \r\n Before I conclude my statement, I would like to \r\nmake the following points. African countries must \r\nredouble their efforts to avoid focusing on a few \r\ndonors for the continent and exclude others. They must \r\ncreate international awareness of the need to provide \r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa while incorporating \r\nNEPAD in African Union structures and operations, \r\nproviding more assistance to the private sector and \r\nincreasing the awareness of civil society. \r\n Partnership is not a temporary process; it is a \r\nlong-term process that needs continuous assessment. \r\nWe welcome the leading role played by the United \r\nNations to mobilize the international community in \r\nfavour of that initiative. African countries have made \r\nsignificant efforts to heed the call of the international \r\ncommunity by assuming a major role in achieving \r\nstability in Africa, in order to encourage donor \r\ncountries and the private sector to offer the necessary \r\neconomic and technical support to the continent. It is \r\nhigh time for the international community to make \r\nmore progress in honouring its commitments. African \r\ncountries, for their part, must take all measures \r\nnecessary to effectively implement the many NEPAD \r\nprojects and programmes in order to ensure that we can \r\nprepare the peaceful environment necessary for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Mrs. Swaraj (India): We would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the fifth consolidated report on \r\nprogress in the implementation of and international \r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/62/203) and the other \r\nreports prepared for this joint debate. We broadly \r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made by the \r\nChair of the Group of 77, but I would like to deal with \r\nsome of the issues discussed in the reports before us. \r\n First of all, I would like to talk about malaria. It \r\nis regrettable that malaria continues to plague several \r\nregions of the world, particularly many parts of Africa. \r\nAs the former Health Minister of India, I can state with \r\nauthority that this disease affects people of all ages, but \r\nis particularly dangerous and debilitating in young \r\nchildren and pregnant women. It disproportionately \r\naffects poor people and worsens the poverty of poor \r\ncountries and communities by incapacitating the \r\nworkforce, decreasing economic productivity and \r\nreducing output. In rural areas, where the transmission \r\nseason generally coincides with the planting and \r\nharvesting seasons, malaria imposes a dual burden on \r\nthe poor.  \r\n The human suffering and economic losses caused \r\nby malaria are unnecessary, as the disease is \r\npreventable, treatable and perfectly curable. The report \r\n(A/62/321) discusses mosquito nets and adequate \r\nresource flow: that is necessary. But what is more \r\nnecessary is protecting access to affordable generic \r\nmedicines, which — I am sorry — the present \r\nintellectual property rights regime does not protect. I \r\nwould therefore like to emphasize that the United \r\nNations should try to improve that situation.  \r\n Equally necessary is economic development, \r\nwhich historically eliminated malaria from the \r\ndeveloped world. For this, capacity-building, science \r\nand technology and a truly developmental Doha Round \r\nare all necessary. I would like now to respond to the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on progress regarding \r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace in Africa (A/62/204). The report states that the \r\nlast few years have witnessed many positive \r\ndevelopments in Africa and that the number of armed \r\nconflicts has been significantly reduced. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral is right in saying that more action is needed, \r\nboth to strengthen and support Africa’s own efforts to \r\nbring peace to the continent and to tackle the wider \r\nsources of armed conflicts. \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n17 07-55167 \r\n \r\n In this context, India welcomes the creation of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission India is strongly \r\ncommitted to the objectives and work of the \r\nCommission and has contributed to the resources of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. The mobilization of resources is \r\nthe key vehicle by which the international community \r\ncan assist post-conflict societies in addressing critical \r\nissues in peace consolidation, on the basis of national \r\nownership of that process. Hopefully that would bring \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions into the ambit of a \r\nlarger perspective. \r\n It is worth remembering that many African \r\ncountries in which conflicts have broken out were, \r\nduring the preceding decade, under an International \r\nMonetary Fund programme for 60 to 80 per cent of the \r\ntime. Economic advice given to them on trade, \r\nsubsidies and agriculture caused many to fall back into \r\ncivil conflict. Therefore, the United Nations must play \r\na central role in the reform of the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions, including by increasing the voice and \r\nparticipation of developing countries, which would \r\nmake the Bretton Woods institutions more responsive \r\nto their needs, including those of Africa. \r\n I am happy to say that India has been one of the \r\noldest, largest and most consistent contributors to \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in Africa. \r\nIndian soldiers have been part of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping and observer missions in more than \r\n10 African countries, including the first United Nations \r\nmission to the Congo, established in 1960. Currently, \r\nthere are more than 8,000 Indian personnel on the \r\nground in Africa. Indian soldiers have been recognized \r\nfor their humanitarian and basic infrastructure projects, \r\nincluding the provision of medical, water and \r\nvocational training assistance programmes. India has \r\nalso contributed female military and police officers to \r\nUnited Nations missions in Africa. In a response to the \r\nSecretary-General’s call, India provided the first \r\nall-female formed police unit for peacekeeping work in \r\nLiberia at the beginning of this year. In addition to its \r\nnormal duties, the unit has been successful in reaching \r\nout to the most vulnerable sections of society, that is, \r\nwomen and children. \r\n Despite positive developments, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral reminds us of the serious challenges that lie \r\nahead: challenges posed by poverty and by a lack of \r\neconomic development and access to basic education, \r\nhealth care and adequate nutrition, which are stumbling \r\nblocks to unleashing the latent talent of the African \r\npeople. It is in that context that the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/62/203) assumes \r\nsignificance. NEPAD reflects the commitment of \r\nAfrican countries to implement their own programmes \r\nof development and self-reliance and the commitment \r\nof the international community to support these efforts. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report highlights the \r\nextensive measures and actions taken by African \r\ncountries and organizations to implement the \r\nobjectives of NEPAD. The report highlights details of \r\nthe achievements of African countries in the areas of \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture, health, education, the \r\nenvironment, information and communication \r\ntechnology, science and technology, gender \r\nmainstreaming and civil society involvement, and the \r\nprogress of the African Peer Review Mechanism. \r\n While several measures have been initiated by the \r\ninternational community to support NEPAD, and while \r\nthere is indeed a greater understanding and awareness \r\nabout the special needs of Africa, NEPAD can succeed \r\nonly if the global partnership delivers in terms of \r\nresources. Pessimism results from the facts that total \r\nofficial development assistance to Africa provided by \r\nthe Development Assistance Committee, excluding \r\ndebt relief, declined in real terms in 2005 and stalled in \r\n2006 and that, with the continuation of present trends, \r\nthe Group of Eight will not be on track to meet the \r\ncommitments of doubling aid to Africa by 2010. \r\nTimely fulfilment of the commitments made by the \r\nGroup of Eight at the 2005 Gleneagles Summit and \r\nthose made at the 2007 Heiligendamm Summit is an \r\nimperative. \r\n The problem of indebtedness has received the \r\nattention of the international community. The \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt \r\nInitiative, combined, are currently helping African \r\ncountries through savings in debt servicing. The MDRI \r\nwill, however, not be fully successful unless donor \r\ncountries adequately offset the lost debt repayments to \r\nthe International Development Association and the \r\nAfrican Development Fund, thus maintaining their \r\ncapacity to issue new grants and affordable loans. \r\n As we have seen, external assistance and an \r\noptimal enabling international economic environment \r\nmust be governed by the logic of economic \r\ndevelopment. For instance, the Doha Round needs to \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 18 \r\n \r\naddress the problem of tariff escalation so that there is \r\nan incentive for Africa to specialize in processing \r\nrather than in raw materials. Consequently, trade that \r\nhelps development, reform of the international \r\nfinancial architecture, meeting official development \r\nassistance commitments and the like are all essential \r\nfor the achievement of the objectives of NEPAD.  \r\n Historically, the invasions of Africa were in \r\nsearch of raw materials such as ivory, gold and \r\ndiamonds. Unless there is a complete break with that, \r\nthe difference from those who marched in the armies of \r\nCecil Rhodes will be one of degree rather than kind. \r\nThe great African writer Chinua Achebe, in his Anthills \r\nof the Savannah, made the point that the most \r\nimportant problem in Africa is not governance but \r\nforeign manipulation. That prevents the poor and \r\ndispossessed, who are the bruised heart that throbs so \r\npainfully at the core of Africa’s being, from coming \r\ninto their own. \r\n India’s solidarity with Africa goes back a long \r\ntime. The Foreign Minister of South Africa, speaking at \r\nthe informal plenary meeting of the General Assembly \r\non 2 October 2007 to observe the first International \r\nDay of Non-Violence, said that South Africans are \r\nproud to claim Mahatma Gandhi as one of their own \r\nbecause it is in South Africa that he developed and \r\nfashioned satyagraha as a tool of liberation. \r\n India’s economic cooperation with Africa is \r\nundertaken through its contribution to NEPAD and \r\nthrough several bilateral and other projects and \r\nprogrammes. Initiatives such as the Techno-Economic \r\nApproach for Africa-India Movement (TEAM-9) and \r\ncooperation with the African Union and the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community and others are in \r\naddition to the several bilateral cooperation efforts \r\nbetween India and Africa that cover, inter alia, \r\ninfrastructure, including railways; food processing; \r\ninformation and communication technology; \r\npharmaceuticals; and small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises. Indian companies, while contributing to \r\neconomic growth, are encouraged to use the \r\nmechanism of joint ventures and employ African \r\nmanagerial and labour talent. \r\n India has been making its contribution to Africa’s \r\nhuman resource development efforts through the \r\ntraining of personnel under the Indian Technical and \r\nEconomic Cooperation Programme (ITEC) programme \r\nwith an outlay of $1 billion and the provision of \r\nexperts to several African countries. Cooperation \r\nthrough the supply of materials and medicines, \r\nincluding antiretroviral drugs to fight HIV/AIDS, are a \r\npart of our overall effort. The Pan-African e-network \r\nproject is proceeding on schedule. The network is \r\naimed at sharing India’s expertise in the fields of health \r\ncare and education with all the countries of Africa and \r\nwill connect 53 African countries into one network \r\nthrough satellite, fibre optics and wireless links to \r\nprovide tele-education, telemedicine and voice and \r\nvideo conference facilities amongst African Heads of \r\nState.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express the hope \r\nthat with such initiatives, we will see very soon a self-\r\nreliant and economically and technologically vibrant \r\nAfrica. We wish them all the best. \r\n Mr. Chávez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peace and \r\nsecurity should be viewed not simply from their \r\npolitical, military and strategic aspects, but rather as \r\nfundamentally social and economic factors. Social, \r\neconomic, political, ethnic and religious exclusion, \r\npoverty and human rights issues are in general the \r\nmain factors that engender violence, instability and \r\nnational fragmentation. That is particularly true in \r\nAfrica.  \r\n Economic growth was at 6 per cent last year, but \r\nthat was essentially due to increases in commodity \r\nprices. Today, only 3 per cent of foreign investment \r\nflows go to Africa, and that investment is linked, \r\nusually, to the exploitation of natural resources or \r\nrelated services.  \r\n In many countries, international aid is still \r\nnecessary to maintaining a functioning State \r\nmechanism. That aid, as the Secretary-General \r\nmentioned in his report, is decreasing. The population \r\ncontinues to grow beyond the capability of the labour \r\nmarket to absorb them. The greater part of the \r\npopulation, 60 per cent, especially young people, lives \r\non one or two dollars per day. This year, we have noted \r\nonce again that the Millennium Development Goals \r\nwill not be met by 2015 in most of the countries of \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, unless radical action reverses that \r\ntrend.  \r\n For those reasons, the priority for the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and \r\ninternational cooperation, in the short term, is to help \r\nsub-Saharan Africa reach the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and join the global economy. Accomplishing that \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n19 07-55167 \r\n \r\nwill require, among other measures, a cancellation — \r\nor at least a substantial reduction — of its debt, good \r\nprices for its export commodities and, at the same time, \r\neffective access to markets.  \r\n Economic dysfunctionality and inadequate reform \r\nprocesses have often helped to destroy the social fabric \r\nof countries, sometimes sinking them into civil \r\nconflict. That is why it is interesting to note that the \r\nWorld Bank has reassessed its approach to the \r\ncontinent, assigning a priority, for example, to \r\nagriculture. Together with the International Monetary \r\nFund, they have joined in the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission.  \r\n The challenges of peace and security in Africa \r\nrequire that the United Nations, and in particular the \r\nSecurity Council, have a strategic vision that considers \r\npeace and security in Africa to require successful \r\nmanagement of four main variables: prevention, \r\ncooperation with regional and subregional \r\norganizations, humanitarian issues and post-conflict \r\nmanagement.  \r\n For that reason, we support the proposal of the \r\nSecretary-General to reinforce United Nations \r\nmediation capabilities and, by extension, assistance to \r\nregional organizations in this and other peacekeeping \r\nareas. It is also important to note the leading role \r\nassumed by the Africans themselves in the area of \r\npeace and security through their regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, in particular the Peace and \r\nSecurity Council of the African Union. We support that \r\nevolution and close cooperation with the United \r\nNations Security Council pursuant to Chapter VIII of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We also support the \r\nwork of international tribunals and the processes for \r\ntransitional justice in Africa.  \r\n When a conflict breaks out and peacekeeping \r\noperations are required, those operations must have a \r\nmultidimensional and strengthened mandate in order to \r\nprotect civilians and undertake peacebuilding efforts. \r\nThe presence of the United Nations should then \r\nprovide a way to comprehensively manage \r\nhumanitarian crises and the transition to post-conflict \r\nstabilization.  \r\n Post-conflict situations are prevalent on the \r\ncontinent. The challenge is to establish democratic \r\ngovernance, social inclusion and integration, due \r\nrespect for human rights, the foundations for a viable \r\neconomy that include adequate management of natural \r\nresources, and sustainable reforms of the security \r\nsector, accompanied by a viable disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration process. If we are not \r\nsuccessful, some countries could fall back into to \r\nconflict. That is why we support the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, in particular as regards the \r\nestablishment of comprehensive strategies for countries \r\nsuch as Burundi and Sierra Leone on the basis of \r\nleadership by each country concerned. \r\n Bearing in mind all of those issues, Peru \r\nco-sponsored the resolution that provides for a hybrid \r\noperation in Darfur. We hope that it will be \r\nimplemented as soon as possible. We also hope the \r\npolitical dialogue among rebel groups and between the \r\ngroups and the Government of National Unity will be \r\nstrengthened. The ultimate objective is to protect the \r\ncivilian population and to prevent an expansion of the \r\nhumanitarian catastrophe. Peru supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his efforts, in particular those carried out to \r\nensure the protection of all civilians. Lastly, we \r\nreiterate the need for all parties to put an end to their \r\nuse of violence. \r\n With regard to Somalia, Peru realistically \r\nacknowledges that the efforts of all the parties to the \r\nconflict have thus far not been able to achieve stability \r\nand lasting peace. We believe that external support \r\nmust be aimed at building a viable, inter-Somali peace \r\naccord, after which the country must be supported in \r\nregaining a centralized authority structure and control \r\nover its entire territory. \r\n A third case is the conflict in the eastern region of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thus far, the \r\nmilitary conflict has exacerbated the immense \r\nhumanitarian crisis. We must continue to pursue \r\npolitical options in the quest for a comprehensive \r\nsolution that includes, beyond the re-establishment of \r\nthe authority of the Government in the area, the \r\nrepatriation of the Forces démocratiques de libération \r\ndu Rwanda (FDLR) and attention to the needs of the \r\nTutsi population. Those are steps that will decide the \r\ncourse of the conflict. \r\n A fourth case is the situation on the border \r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea. We hope that those \r\ncountries will exercise the utmost caution in their \r\nactions, in order to avoid an escalation of the situation \r\nand effectively discharge their international \r\nobligations. Both countries must redouble their efforts \r\nto contribute to peace in their own region. \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 20 \r\n \r\n Despite certain difficulties, there is an \r\nopportunity to rebuild the social fabric of many African \r\nStates that are emerging from conflict situations and to \r\ngive newborn democracies a chance at being viable and \r\ngovernable. The efforts of the countries of the region, \r\nthe international community and, in particular, the \r\npeople themselves are urgently required. We call on all \r\nactors to be responsible and not squander the \r\nopportunities for peace, security and development that \r\nthe international community can help them attain and \r\nwhich their peoples demand and deserve. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in French): First \r\nand foremost, allow me to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation to the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor the very rewarding introduction with which he \r\nopened this debate on the economic and social \r\nsituation in Africa, in particular on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and \r\nfor the reports presented by the Secretary-General.  \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by Pakistan, on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, and Benin, on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, and we wish to raise a few points of particular \r\ninterest to Tunisia. \r\n The increasingly marked interest of the \r\ninternational community and the United Nations \r\nsystem in Africa is based on two facts. First, the \r\nAfrican continent is the region most affected by the \r\nthree principal scourges facing humanity, namely, \r\npoverty, conflicts and pandemics. This explains to a \r\nlarge extent the fact that Africa is lagging behind in \r\nachieving the deadlines for the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Secondly, Africa is a \r\ncontinent on the move, courageously taking care of \r\nitself and endeavouring, in political and economic \r\nterms at the national and regional level, to take charge \r\nof its fate and to progress despite the challenges of its \r\nenvironment.  \r\n The fifth report of the Secretary-General on \r\nprogress in implementation and international support \r\nfor the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(A/62/203) notes a number of contrasting issues with \r\nregard to the support of the international community in \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD — the comprehensive \r\nand integrated programme serving in the development \r\nof Africa — in particular the achievement of the \r\nMDGs, and the basis of cooperation with its partners. \r\nThe report highlights in particular the need to \r\nstrengthen national and regional capacities responsible \r\nfor implementing NEPAD and to insure coherency and \r\ncoordination between the national development \r\nprogrammes, international support and the NEPAD \r\npriorities. \r\n It is well established that despite the desire of \r\nAfrican countries to take charge of their own fate and \r\nthe increased commitment of their partners, the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD and the achievement of the \r\nMDGs still depend on greater mobilization of the \r\ninternational community and better harmonization of \r\nthe different aid instruments. Giving priority to specific \r\nAfrican needs is certainly at the heart of the \r\ninternational and the United Nations agenda, but that \r\nconsensus must be translated into a true development \r\npartnership for our continent, which has long been \r\nweakened by the torments of armed conflicts, \r\ninstability, poverty and pandemics.  \r\n Tunisia welcomes the conclusions of the \r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination (CPC) \r\nconcerning renewed United Nations commitment to \r\nprovide more-coordinated support and to better \r\nintegrate strategies favourable to the objectives and \r\npriorities of NEPAD. On the basis of the CPC \r\nrecommendations, my delegation calls for \r\nstrengthening the material and human resources of the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General \r\non Africa, which is also the centre for coordinating the \r\nsupport of the United Nations system for NEPAD. \r\n With regard to political instability and conflict \r\nand post-conflict situations, my delegation believes \r\nthat normalization of reconstruction and development \r\ncalls for enhanced and better-targeted international, \r\neconomic and political support. In that context, the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission can \r\nbenefit Africa, considering that our continent is the \r\ntheatre of 75 per cent of the conflict and post-conflict \r\nsituations worldwide. \r\n Given that, we should highlight the welcome role \r\nof the African Union, in particular its Peace and \r\nSecurity Council, an instrument to which more \r\nmaterial, political, legal, regulatory and institutional \r\nresources must be made available. The recent \r\nestablishment of an hybrid force of the African Union \r\n(AU) and the United Nations in Darfur is an edifying \r\nillustration of how structured, targeted and coordinated \r\ncooperation between the AU and the United Nations is \r\nwell able to contribute to setting up an African capacity \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n21 07-55167 \r\n \r\nfor preventing conflicts and for peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding. Without the commitment of all partners, \r\nthe ambitious goal of achieving a conflict-free Africa \r\nby 2010 will remain far out of reach. \r\n With regard to pandemics, given their devastating \r\nimpact on human resources and on development \r\nprospects, as well as their repercussions that aggravate \r\nconflicts and penalize all stabilization plans, a global \r\npartnership with adequate funding and human and \r\ntechnical resources is for us not only a choice but an \r\nimperative. At this pace, without a more consistent \r\nglobal mobilization at all levels, the MDG objective of \r\neradicating malaria by 2015 will be nothing but a pious \r\nwish. And despite all the efforts made and all the \r\nmechanisms established, malaria causes the death of \r\n1 million people each year, the majority of whom are \r\nchildren and 90 per cent of whom live in Africa. As \r\nstated in the report of the Secretary-General on that \r\nsubject, international efforts — here we salute their \r\nworthiness and — have more often taken the form of \r\nemergency action focused on providing resources, \r\nrather than financial and technical operations to \r\nstrengthen national healthcare capacities and \r\ninfrastructure.  \r\n Far from being a cause of despair, that rather \r\ngloomy picture of the situation in Africa should spur \r\nall sectors of the international community to redouble \r\nefforts, within the framework of a true development \r\npartnership, to enable Africa to experience a true \r\nrevival and to adapt and accelerate its political and \r\nsocial development processes and thus its effective \r\nintegration into the world economy.  \r\n My delegation hopes that the high-level meeting \r\non Africa’s development, which will take place during \r\nthe Assembly’s sixty-third session, will lead to more \r\nconcrete commitments in favour of Africa, \r\ncommitments which will truly make an effective \r\ncontribution to building the peace, security and \r\nprosperity of the continent. \r\n Mrs. Núñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Cuba acknowledges the efforts carried out by \r\nour African brethren through the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), which was conceived \r\nas a collective vision and strategic framework for \r\ndevelopment in Africa. However, there still remain \r\nhuge obstacles and challenges to confront in order for \r\nthe African continent to be able to overcome the \r\ncritical situation it suffers today and to attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Many developed countries continue to hold a \r\nwrong view of Africa. Their deliberate political \r\nblindness makes them regard that great continent only \r\nas a myth and a source of wealth from which to get \r\nsubstantial profits for their own benefit, disregarding \r\nthe catastrophic consequences that the centuries-long \r\nplundering and exploitation process has brought to the \r\nAfrican peoples. That misguided view has impeded \r\nunderstanding and acquiring a genuine awareness of \r\nthe difficult situation the continent is experiencing and \r\nof the need to pay the incalculable historic debt that all \r\nhumankind owes to Africa. \r\n They have apparently forgotten that it was the \r\neconomic and financial policies and the waves of \r\nunrestrained privatization that they imposed on the \r\nAfrican countries that have been responsible for \r\nstrengthening the precarious situation that African \r\ncountries are experiencing and suffering from. \r\n Africa remains marginalized and at a total \r\ndisadvantage in international economic relations. In \r\naddition poverty, unemployment, the surge of armed \r\nconflicts and the spreading of diseases such as \r\nHIV/AIDS are decimating entire nations of the \r\ncontinent, all of which predicts that the region will not \r\nbe able to attain the Millennium Development Goals \r\nwithin the set deadline. \r\n In the last 20 years, the imposition of trade \r\nliberalization has cost the African countries more than \r\n$270 billion, an amount that could have paid off the \r\ncontinent’s debt. Moreover, it has brought about a \r\nserious deterioration in the terms of trade and an \r\nincrease in the flight of capital, which continues to be \r\nthe greatest in the world in regional terms. \r\n With 11 per cent of the world’s population and \r\nthe most natural reserves of the planet, Africa \r\ncontributes only 1 per cent to the world gross domestic \r\nproduct, and its participation in international trade is \r\nbarely 2 per cent. The commitment of the developed \r\ncountries to increase aid by $50 billion annually until \r\n2010 is still an illusion. Official development \r\nassistance to Africa has not changed since 2004 and \r\nremains far from the amount needed for our African \r\nbrothers to attain the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWhile foreign direct investment flows in Africa have \r\nincreased somewhat, Africa’s percentage of global \r\nforeign investment continues to be small, around 3 per cent.  \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 22 \r\n \r\n For Cuba, Africa is not a legend far off in time or \r\nspace. Africa is one of the nourishing elements of our \r\nidentity and culture. It is part of what we are. It is one \r\nof the main roots of the Cuban population. Our nation \r\ngerminated from the fertile mixture of African, \r\nEuropean and Chinese blood, and it sprang forth \r\nproclaiming its pride in its African roots and the \r\nemancipation of its children of African origin.  \r\n The uprisings of slaves and their running away \r\nnurtured our hunger for freedom. Our wars of \r\nindependence depended on the massive participation of \r\nAfrican descendants, who provided brilliant leaders for \r\nour army of liberation.  \r\n That is why, in the early years of our revolution, \r\nCuba offered and continues to offer its support and \r\nsolidarity to African peoples through consistent \r\ninternationalism and solidarity with the peoples of the \r\nworld, a cardinal principle of our foreign policy. \r\n Despite the fact that Cuba is a country with scant \r\nresources and that it has been subject for more than \r\nfour decades to a cruel and genocidal economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade by the Government \r\nof the United States, more than 30,000 African students \r\nhave been trained in Cuba. Around 2,000 young people \r\nfrom 44 African countries are currently studying in our \r\nuniversities. Of them, more than 700 are studying \r\nmedicine.  \r\n Tens of thousands of Cuban doctors, teachers, \r\nengineers and builders have gone to Africa. More than \r\n2,400 Cuban assistance workers may be found in \r\nAfrican countries unselfishly providing their services. \r\nAmong them, close to 2,000 Cuban doctors, nurses and \r\nhealth technicians are working in the fight against \r\nAIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other illnesses that \r\ncontinue to bring suffering to the continent. \r\n In the context of our comprehensive health \r\nprogramme, our doctors have saved the lives of more \r\nthan 730,000 Africans, and currently, in several African \r\ncountries, a literacy campaign is being carried out to \r\nease the critical situation of illiteracy facing the \r\ncontinent. \r\n When it became necessary, Cuban blood was also \r\nshed in Africa. We brought back from there only the \r\nphysical remains of our combatants. We did not go to \r\nbring back gold, diamonds or oil. We went to fight for \r\nfreedom, against colonialism and apartheid. \r\n Our cooperation with African countries proves \r\nthat significant results can be achieved when there is \r\nserious political will. \r\n Cuba reiterates its unwavering solidarity with the \r\npeoples and the Governments of Africa in their \r\nstruggles against the poverty and underdevelopment \r\ninherited from centuries of slavery, wars of pillage, \r\ncolonialism and an utterly unfair and exclusive \r\ninternational economic order. \r\n We also reaffirm our determination to continue \r\nproviding, as far as our capabilities allow, our helping \r\nhand and the support of our principal resource — \r\nhuman capital created by the Revolution. \r\n The peoples of Africa do not need to be reminded \r\nof their difficulties and sufferings. They do not need \r\nalms or paltry initiatives or false commitments or \r\nhypocritical lessons on what is most useful for them. \r\n Africa needs to have its foreign debt cancelled. It \r\nneeds special and differentiated treatment, access to \r\nmarkets, fair prices for its exports, access to \r\ntechnology and to the training of human resources, as \r\nwell as assistance in the fight against disease. \r\n Africa needs international cooperation and the \r\npolitical will of all for our African brethren to have a \r\ndecent future. \r\n Mr. Korga (Togo) (spoke in French): It is a great \r\nprivilege for us to address this Assembly on one of the \r\nmost crucial issues on the international community’s \r\nagenda.  \r\n We fully subscribe to the statement made by \r\nPakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and \r\nthe one made by Benin on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States. Our delegation would like, \r\nnevertheless, to make a number of observations and \r\nunderscore certain points that are very important for \r\nour country. \r\n When some decades ago, the international \r\ncommunity became truly aware of the severity of the \r\neconomic and social difficulties that Africa was facing, \r\na certain number of programmes were designed under \r\nthe aegis of the United Nations to help the continent \r\nfind its way towards economic growth and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n I will mention only two — The United Nations \r\nProgram of Action for African Economic Recovery and \r\nDevelopment (UNPAAERD) in the 1980s and the \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n23 07-55167 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of \r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). The optimism and \r\nhope evoked by those two programmes inspired our \r\ncountries to courageously pursue the economic reforms \r\nundertaken from the beginning of the 1980s and aimed \r\nat promoting long-term development, thanks in \r\nparticular to the installation of a regulatory framework \r\nthat was much more liberal and likely to act as an \r\nincentive for the promotion of the private sector as the \r\nengine of growth. \r\n Despite the efforts and the sacrifices made, the \r\nmain objective of those programmes was not obtained \r\nowing to the lack of sustained and adequate financial \r\nand technical support from the international \r\ncommunity. Faced with these facts and given the \r\nsustained deterioration of the social and economic \r\nsituation in Africa, six years ago the leaders of the \r\ncontinent jointly designed the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD).  \r\n As a veritable, complete and comprehensive \r\nstrategic plan, the realization of which should allow \r\nour countries to overcome the challenges that they are \r\nfacing, NEPAD is also proof of the commitment of our \r\nheads of State taken before their peoples to free them \r\nfrom destitution and extreme poverty. NEPAD is above \r\nall an appeal for a new partnership with the \r\ninternational community, where its support is necessary \r\nor even indispensable to hasten the integration of \r\nAfrica into the world economy. \r\n It is thus with great hope and satisfaction that the \r\nleaders of Africa noted, following the launching of \r\nNEPAD, that their appeal received a favourable \r\nreception from the international community. In effect, \r\nthe General Assembly immediately made NEPAD the \r\nguiding plan for the actions of the international \r\ncommunity, in particular of the United Nations, actions \r\nto be undertaken to support the development \r\nprogramme of the continent. \r\n The need to reinforce support for NEPAD was \r\nreaffirmed by the General Assembly, which in \r\nresolution 61/229, adopted in December 2006, called \r\nfor greater coherence in the work of the United Nations \r\nsystem in support of African countries. \r\n For their part, the development partners \r\nundertook numerous commitments, particularly at \r\nGroup of Eight summits. These initiatives, aimed at \r\nproviding direct or indirect support for NEPAD \r\nprogrammes, include commitments intended to respond \r\nto the specific needs of Africa.  \r\n At the outset of our statement, we looked back a \r\nfew years to pose the serious question of whether \r\nNEPAD is going to suffer the same luck as its \r\npredecessors, and if consciously or unconsciously the \r\ninternational community is going to insert it in the \r\nspiral of missed opportunities for Africa.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s fifth report on progress \r\nmade in the implementation of and international \r\nsupport for NEPAD (A/62/203) is not encouraging. In \r\nthat report the Secretary-General underscored that, in \r\nreal terms, official development assistance (ODA) \r\ncontributions to sub-Saharan Africa have suffered a \r\ndrop in 2005, stagnated in 2006 and risk further \r\nreduction in 2007. The Secretary-General warns that, if \r\nthe current trend continues, the Group of Eight (G-8) \r\ncountries might not be able to fulfil their commitment \r\nto double aid to Africa by 2010.  \r\n The areas of debt alleviation and growth of \r\ninvestment flows have slightly improved, but we are \r\ndisappointed in that there has been very little progress \r\nin multilateral trade negotiations, specifically on the \r\nthorny question of the elimination of agricultural \r\nsubsidies. Also, the negotiations of economic \r\npartnership agreements between the European Union \r\nand Africa constitute, in their present form, a source of \r\nconcern for our countries.  \r\n Built upon the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), the NEPAD development model favours the \r\nattainment of those Goals. How is it that, as this \r\nsession is taking place, halfway to 2015, the target date \r\nfor the MDGs, and given the lack of progress, we are \r\nnot concerned by the fact that not a single African \r\ncountry will attain all of the established goals. This sad \r\nreality demands the attention of the entire international \r\ncommunity. That is why we call once again on all of \r\nAfrica’s development partners in general, and to the \r\nG-8 countries in particular, to honour the commitments \r\nthey assumed in different international forums from \r\nMonterrey and Gleneagles to Heiligendamm, so as to \r\nenable our countries to advance the vision of NEPAD.  \r\n Urgent measures must be undertaken to increase \r\naid flows, to improve their effectiveness pursuant to \r\nthe Paris Declaration, to cancel the entirety of African \r\ndebt and to ensure that trade will benefit Africa, \r\nincluding by the prompt conclusion of the Doha \r\nRound. It is important for the negotiation of \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 24 \r\n \r\npartnership agreements between the European Union \r\nand African groups to be more than simple trade \r\nagreements. Rather, they should favour development in \r\norder to accelerate and enhance the integration of our \r\nregion and the renewal of our economies.  \r\n In requesting the support of the international \r\ncommunity for the implementation of this ambitious \r\ninitiative called NEPAD, African leaders are aware that \r\nthey bear primary responsibility for the development of \r\ntheir continent. That is why our countries are sparing \r\nno effort to advance NEPAD in those priority areas.  \r\n As underscored by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport, progress has been achieved in priority areas, \r\nsuch as infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, \r\nthe environment, new information and communications \r\ntechnologies, science and technology and gender issues \r\namong others. We especially welcome the \r\nestablishment of the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\nwhich is the cornerstone of good political and \r\neconomic governance in Africa. Despite the \r\ninsufficiency of institutional financial means, year by \r\nyear our countries are strengthening the Mechanism \r\nand achieving full ownership. Furthermore, major \r\nefforts have been made to create greater awareness \r\namong the public, especially in the private sector, \r\nabout NEPAD and its programmes. In Togo, the \r\ncreation of the NEPAD Business Group Togo is part of \r\nthose efforts.  \r\n In inviting the international community to assist \r\nthem the implementation of NEPAD, the leaders of \r\nAfrica call for the necessary human solidarity that \r\nalone will make it possible to overcome the challenges \r\nof our times. The shared problems of development and \r\nrealization of our people call for a spirit of partnership \r\nand shared responsibility to achieve appropriate, \r\nlasting solutions to the issues facing the international \r\ncommunity. In this era of globalization, small islands \r\nof prosperity are insignificant when surrounded by an \r\nocean of poverty. Let us globalize democracy and \r\npeace, but let us also globalize prosperity and \r\nwell-being. That is the vision of NEPAD; together, let \r\nus work to achieve it.  \r\n Mr. Sahel (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statements made \r\nby the representative of Benin on behalf of the African \r\nGroup and by the representative of Pakistan on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China. \r\n During the general debate at the sixty-first \r\nsession, in September 2006, Morocco proposed that a \r\nhigh-level dialogue be held on Africa and development \r\n(see A/61/PV.17). This proposal was approved by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which decided to hold in 2008 a \r\nhigh-level meeting on Africa’s development needs (see \r\nresolution 61/229). That meeting, we hope, will \r\nprovide an opportunity for us to identify the needs of \r\nAfrica as it moves to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the development \r\ngoals of New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD). It should also be an opportunity to breathe \r\nnew life into cooperation across the African continent \r\nand to highlight the continent’s huge potential. \r\n The international community has committed \r\nitself, particularly at the Monterrey Conference, the \r\nJohannesburg Summit, the Conference on Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, held in Brussels, the Millennium \r\nSummit in 2000 and the 2005 World Summit, to \r\nprovide aid and support to Africa. Developed countries \r\nhave indeed committed themselves to increasing \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) to Africa and to \r\nfacilitating the creation of an international environment \r\nconducive to its development. Other initiatives have \r\nbeen adopted for Africa, in particular that of the Group \r\nof Eight (G-8) to double ODA to Africa by 2010. \r\nHowever, the Secretary-General’s report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/62/1) and the report on progress in \r\nand international support for the implementation of \r\nNEPAD (A/62/203), note a decrease in ODA for \r\nAfrica. \r\n On a different note, notable progress has indeed \r\nbeen achieved on external debt relief. Several countries \r\nhave been able to benefit from substantial debt relief \r\nthanks to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt \r\nInitiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, as \r\nwell as to bilateral debt-relief initiatives. However, \r\nmuch remains to be done to ensure that all African \r\ncountries that meet the required conditions are able to \r\nbenefit from these initiatives. \r\n On foreign direct investment, Africa still is the \r\nregion that receives the lowest amount of investment \r\nflows. The continent attracts only 3 per cent of \r\nworldwide investment flows, and those investments are \r\nin general focused in a very small number of countries. \r\nDespite the progress seen in the majority of African \r\ncountries in the areas of macroeconomic policy reform, \r\ngood governance and the rule of law, Africa has not yet \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n25 07-55167 \r\n \r\nbeen able to attract the investment necessary for its \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Africa cannot be integrated into the world \r\neconomy without a massive influx of foreign direct \r\ninvestment and a strengthening of production and \r\nexport capacity. Capacity-building remains a \r\nconsiderable challenge, and lack of capacity is a major \r\nstructural handicap that hampers the development of \r\nour continent. It is clear that, without improved market \r\naccess, the policies undertaken by African countries \r\naimed at economic liberalization and opening up to the \r\noutside world cannot succeed.  \r\n The United Nations system, particularly the \r\ndevelopment agencies and the international and \r\nregional financial institutions, must play the lead role \r\nin mobilizing the aid and support necessary for Africa. \r\nWe await with interest the recommendations of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals Africa Steering Group, \r\nwhich was recently established by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The work of the Group, which brings together \r\nthe heads of United Nations agencies, will be very \r\nuseful for the high-level meeting planned for the sixty-\r\nthird session. \r\n Those are some of the areas that should be at the \r\nheart of the discussions with a view to next year’s \r\nhigh-level meeting. Morocco is prepared to participate \r\nconstructively in the preparations for that event, \r\nparticularly within the framework of the Group of \r\nAfrican States and the Group of 77. \r\n With regard to activities aimed at promoting \r\ncooperation for economic and social development in \r\nAfrica and contributing to the achievement of \r\nNEPAD’s objectives, Morocco has undertaken many \r\nincentive measures not only to produce immediate \r\nresults, but also, and in particular, to create lasting \r\nmomentum and ensure sustainable development. It is \r\nfrom that perspective that Morocco has decided to \r\nprovide free access to exports from Africa’s least \r\ndeveloped countries. Consultations are under way with \r\nother countries with a view to trade liberalization. \r\n Thus, Morocco has committed itself to promoting \r\ncommercial trade with the countries of the West \r\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union and is about to \r\nconclude a free-trade agreement with the States \r\nmembers of that organization to strengthen trade and \r\ninvestment cooperation. Furthermore, in 2001 Morocco \r\njoined the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, \r\ncomprising 16 countries of the region. We remain \r\nactively engaged in other processes involving North \r\nAfrican countries. \r\n Promoting partnerships with countries of our \r\ncontinent is particularly important to us. Indeed, within \r\nthe framework of our activities to fulfil NEPAD’s \r\nobjectives and priorities, Morocco encourages the \r\nestablishment of partnerships with our partners on the \r\nAfrican continent, involving the participation of the \r\nprivate sector. Many sectors — particularly \r\ninfrastructure, telecommunications, banking, air and \r\nsea transport, housing, water and agriculture — are \r\ninvolved.  \r\n All these initiatives attest to the strengthening of \r\nMorocco’s ties, solidarity, partnership and trade with \r\nother African countries in the context of regional \r\neconomic integration. \r\n Similarly, Morocco distinguishes itself through a \r\ncooperation policy in the areas of university education \r\nand training. The Kingdom of Morocco offers more \r\nthan 7,000 scholarships to students from African \r\ncountries. That is a considerable investment in training, \r\nwhich remains a key to human development. Morocco \r\nhas also developed triangular cooperation in \r\ncollaboration with European countries, Japan and \r\nregional and international organizations. \r\n Morocco’s activities to promote South-South \r\ncooperation accord priority to concrete projects in \r\nareas vital for human development and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Ours is an innovative approach that \r\nplaces the social dimension at the centre of \r\ndevelopment discussions through a participative \r\napproach involving the population, through non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and local elected officials, \r\nin the definition of needs and priorities.  \r\n Furthermore, it is in that spirit that Morocco, in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, hosted the first African Conference on \r\nHuman Development, last April. The debates among \r\nthe 49 ministers who took part in the Conference \r\nshowed a real will to strengthen their solidarity and \r\ntheir ties of cooperation in order to improve the living \r\nconditions of African populations. The Conference \r\nadopted a ministerial Declaration setting out \r\nfundamental principles that will enable the African \r\ncontinent to instil new momentum into South-South \r\ncooperation. The Conference also made it possible to \r\nlaunch exchange mechanisms and networks to \r\nstrengthen such cooperation. Gabon has indicated its \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 26 \r\n \r\nwillingness to host a second African Conference on \r\nHuman Development, in 2009. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to reaffirm my \r\ncountry’s resolve to continue its efforts to promote \r\ninvestment and development in Africa and to work to \r\ncreate an environment conducive to thriving trade and \r\ngrowth. We reaffirm our full support for all NEPAD \r\ninitiatives to that end.  \r\n Ms. Knight (United States of America): We \r\nshould like to thank the Secretary-General and the \r\nmembers of the Secretariat who have provided us with \r\nthe progress report on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/62/203), the report on \r\nimplementing the recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the causes of conflict and the promotion of \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n(A/62/204) and the report on the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, particularly in Africa \r\n(A/62/321). \r\n The United States congratulates the African \r\nmembers of NEPAD on six years of enhancing \r\neconomic growth and good governance across the \r\ncontinent. During the past six years, the United States \r\nGovernment has collaborated with NEPAD on a wide \r\nvariety of programmes in agriculture, power \r\ninfrastructure, trade development and other areas. A \r\nmajor NEPAD programme that the United States has \r\ncontinued to support is the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme (CAADP). We \r\nsupport the CAADP in six countries that are meeting \r\ntheir pledges to increase support and attention to the \r\nagricultural sector. We hope that the CAADP will \r\nreduce food insecurity by facilitating the development \r\nof regional agricultural markets and trade. \r\n For the United States, support for NEPAD is one \r\nway of recognizing that Africa, more than ever, is \r\ntaking advantage of the synergy between democracy, \r\ngood governance and free markets. In 1990, the  \r\nnon-governmental organization Freedom House \r\nclassified 24 sub-Saharan African countries as free or \r\npartly free. In 2007, 33 are seen as free or partly free, \r\nwith only 15 classified as not free. \r\n Per capita economic growth of more than \r\n3 per cent last year is a sign that African States are \r\nsucceeding at encouraging entrepreneurship and \r\neconomic activity. Indeed, this year the World Bank’s \r\n“Doing Business 2007” reports that Africa ranks third \r\namong the world’s regions in introducing regulatory \r\nreform. \r\n We firmly support sub-Saharan countries in \r\nimplementing policies and creating infrastructure \r\nnecessary for development, economic growth and job \r\ncreation. Recently, the Millennium Challenge \r\nCorporation announced a $698 million grant to \r\nTanzania for infrastructure improvements in transport, \r\nenergy and water and a $164 million grant to Lesotho \r\nfor dam construction and water urban infrastructure. \r\nThe programmes of the Millennium Challenge \r\nCorporation, the United States Agency for International \r\nDevelopment and the African Growth and Opportunity \r\nAct are strong signs of the commitment of the United \r\nStates to work with African nations and African \r\ninstitutions, such as NEPAD, on meeting the \r\nMillennium Development Goals through economic \r\ngrowth and poverty reduction. \r\n The United States welcomes the report on the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa (A/62/321). Each year, an \r\nestimated 300 to 500 million people become ill with \r\nmalaria worldwide and more than 1 million die. \r\nEighty-five per cent of these deaths occur in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. Recognizing the critical need for \r\ngreater international efforts to reduce the burden of \r\nmalaria across Africa, President George W. Bush in \r\nJune 2005 announced the President’s Malaria Initiative \r\n(PMI).  \r\n The PMI represents a historic five-year expansion \r\nof United States Government resources to fight malaria \r\nin regions most affected by the disease. President Bush \r\ncommitted an additional $1.2 billion to this Initiative, \r\nand set the ambitious goal of reducing malaria \r\nmortality by 50 per cent in the 15 Malaria Initiative \r\nfocus countries by 2010. Those countries include \r\nAngola, Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, \r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, \r\nSenegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.  \r\n President and Mrs. Bush also hosted a \r\nWhite House summit on malaria in December 2006 to \r\nraise awareness about malaria and mobilize a grass-\r\nroots effort to save millions of lives from the disease. \r\nThese new resources, combined with major \r\ncontributions from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria are helping ramp up \r\ncomprehensive control efforts in African countries, and \r\nin all malaria-endemic countries.  \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n27 07-55167 \r\n \r\n Nearly one third of these resources are provided \r\nby the World Bank Booster Programme for Malaria \r\nControl, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the \r\nWorld Health Organization, UNICEF, the Malaria \r\nControl and Evaluation Partnership in Africa, the Roll \r\nBack Malaria Partnership and the generosity of the \r\nAmerican people, including from those in my home \r\nstate of Kentucky.  \r\n PMI has moved quickly. By the end of 2007, we \r\nexpect to reach 30 million people with life-saving \r\nprevention and treatment measures, and by the end of \r\nnext year, working in partnership with national \r\nGovernments, the Global Fund, the World Bank, \r\nUNICEF and others, PMI is expected to make major \r\ngains in net ownership and use of lifesaving \r\nartemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).  \r\n Partnerships are at the heart of PMI’s strategy. \r\nGiven the enormous burden of malaria and the \r\nambitious target of reducing malaria deaths by half by \r\n2010, effective partnerships, particularly at the country \r\nlevel, are essential to reach the maximum number of \r\npeople. For this reason, PMI closely coordinates its \r\nactivities with host Governments, international \r\norganizations, the private sector and non-governmental \r\nand faith-based organizations.  \r\n The United States is working with the private \r\nsector to mobilize further financial support and draw \r\non its experience in planning and logistics to create \r\nrobust public-private partnerships to reach those \r\naffected by this preventable and treatable disease.  \r\n According to a new UNICEF report, tangible \r\nprogress is being made in the fight against malaria, \r\nsetting the stage for dramatic gains in the next few \r\nyears. With a new set of sophisticated, cost-effective \r\ntools, such as insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual \r\nspraying of households and ACTs, the world is poised \r\nto radically reduce the human and economic costs of \r\nmalaria. We celebrate this good news, recommit our \r\nefforts and urge other countries and public and private \r\ngroups to expand their commitments to address this \r\ntremendous burden. \r\n To conclude, let me emphasize that the United \r\nStates supports the members of NEPAD and the people \r\nof Africa in achieving peace and stability, freedom \r\nfrom highly endemic disease and prosperity through \r\ntrade and economic freedom. Our commitment will not \r\nfalter. We stand ready to work with our partners to \r\nmeet these global challenges and realize Africa’s \r\npromise.  \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I wish to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report on progress in the \r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/62/203) and on \r\nimplementation of the recommendations in the report \r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace (A/62/204) and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica. We also appreciate the report on the Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa (A/62/321).  \r\n I endorse the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and by the representative of Benin on behalf \r\nof the African Group.  \r\n Egypt attaches great importance to the review of \r\nprogress achieved in the implementation of NEPAD, as \r\nthat initiative represents a collective framework and a \r\njoint vision agreed to by the countries of the continent \r\nand supported by the international community, with a \r\nview to achieving the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Six years have passed \r\nsince NEPAD was launched; also, we are approaching \r\nthe midpoint review of the MDGs. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report shows that most African countries are \r\nstill far off track in achieving the Goals. This is a \r\nsource of major concern to us, especially as our \r\ncontinent, Africa, is home to the greatest number of \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs).  \r\n African countries are implementing their \r\nobligations in accordance with the NEPAD initiative in \r\nvarious fields, such as basic infrastructure, health, \r\nagriculture, education, information and communications \r\ntechnology, science and technology, including the \r\nestablishment and the operationalization of the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism, which 26 countries, \r\nrepresenting about 75 per cent of the total African \r\npopulation, have joined voluntarily. However, \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD) statistics reflect a drop in the \r\ntotal volume of official development assistance (ODA) \r\nprovided to the continent in 2005. This is the first time \r\nthis has happened since 1997, and it parallels the delay \r\nby the Group of Eight industrial countries in reaching \r\ntheir target of doubling the volume of their assistance \r\nA/62/PV.27  \r\n \r\n07-55167 28 \r\n \r\nto Africa by 2010. This confirms the need for an honest \r\nand swift implementation of previous commitments \r\nand for increased foreign direct investment in African \r\ncountries. At present, Africa’s share of such investment \r\ndoes not exceed 3 per cent, which limits the continent’s \r\nability to continue building the national and capacities \r\ninstitutions that can improve its productive capacity, \r\npromote diversification and upgrade its labour force.  \r\n Because international trade represents an \r\nimportant engine for development in African countries, \r\nEgypt concurs with the Secretary-General that any \r\nagreement resulting from the Doha Round of trade \r\nnegotiations — and any other multilateral trade \r\nagreements — must take into account the specific \r\ndevelopment needs of the African continent. While \r\nwelcoming the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt \r\n(HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief \r\nInitiative, progress is still slow in this regard. African \r\ncountries are in need of additional and innovative \r\nresources to finance their development. The High-level \r\nDialogue on financing for development scheduled for \r\nnext week offers a timely opportunity to call upon \r\ndonor countries and international and regional financial \r\ninstitutions to seriously assist the continent in \r\nachieving its development goals.  \r\n The issue of climate change is an essential \r\ninternational priority. Here, Africa is one of the regions \r\nof the world most adversely affected by climate \r\nchange, although its countries are the lowest \r\ncontributors to the emissions leading to climate \r\nchange. If the countries of the continent are to adapt to \r\nthe effects of this phenomenon and effectively \r\ncontribute to international efforts to address it, \r\ninternational assistance to African countries in the \r\nfields of capacity-building and technology transfer, \r\nincluding through the provision of the required \r\nfinancial resources, must become an integral part of \r\nany international action to deal with this phenomenon \r\nin the future.  \r\n I would like to further point out that the United \r\nNations plays an important role in supporting the \r\nefforts of Africa. We look forward to the continuation \r\nand strengthening of that role in order to extend it to \r\nevaluating and monitoring the implementation of \r\nUnited Nations activities towards the implementation \r\nof the goals of NEPAD. That goes hand in hand with \r\nthe positive role played by regional organizations and \r\ninstitutions, such as the African Development Bank and \r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa, in addition to \r\nthe vital efforts, at the subregional level, of the \r\nregional economic groupings. \r\n In that regard, I would like to refer to the efforts \r\nof the Egyptian National Fund for Technical \r\nCooperation with Africa since 1981 in providing \r\nEgyptian support to African countries in such fields as \r\nhealth, education, agriculture, humanitarian assistance, \r\nwhich constitute the main pillars of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. This assistance is provided on a \r\nbilateral basis or through trilateral cooperation with \r\nother donor countries. \r\n We also have before us the Secretary-General’s \r\nprogress report (A/62/204) on the causes of conflict in \r\nAfrica, together with the challenges facing the \r\ncontinent. Such challenges obstruct the establishment \r\nof peace and development and require that the \r\ninternational community intensify its engagement with \r\nAfrican countries to help them achieve their national \r\npriorities and development objectives without \r\ninfringing upon national sovereignty or imposing more \r\nconditionalities. \r\n On the basis of Africa’s belief in the correlation \r\namong security, development and human rights, the \r\nAfrican Union has established the African Peace and \r\nSecurity Architecture, which comprises the Peace and \r\nSecurity Council of the African Union, a Panel of the \r\nWise, a continental early warning system and the \r\nbeginnings of an African standby force. This \r\nculminated in a partnership between the African Union \r\nand the United Nations, through the signing of the \r\ndeclaration regarding cooperation between the two \r\norganizations in November 2006. Efforts are also being \r\nexerted to prepare a 10-year capacity-building \r\nprogramme for the African Union, encompassing, inter \r\nalia, the boosting of cooperation in all phases of \r\nconflict management; early warning; preventive \r\ndiplomacy; making, building and keeping peace; post-\r\nconflict reconstruction; and human rights. \r\n The joint efforts of the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union in Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, \r\nthe Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nhave produced numerous achievements. We look \r\nforward to increasing those achievements by achieving \r\npeace in Darfur. These achievements also include the \r\nrestructuring of the partnership between the specialized \r\nagencies and Africa, and to an increase in the interest \r\nof United Nations bodies such as the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the Peacebuilding Commission in \r\n A/62/PV.27\r\n \r\n29 07-55167 \r\n \r\ndealing with the new challenges facing the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n The Egyptian delegation shares in the ambitious \r\nplan presented by the Secretary-General in his report \r\naiming at achieving a conflict-free Africa by 2010. \r\nEgypt also supports the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for a comprehensive review of the proposals \r\nmade in 1998 by the former Secretary-General to \r\nestablish peace and security in Africa.  \r\n On the proposal to strengthen negotiations to \r\nformulate a legally binding comprehensive instrument \r\nsetting out new global standards for importing, \r\nexporting and transferring conventional weapons, we \r\nreiterate the need for the Secretariat to respect its \r\nmandate pursuant to resolution 61/89. In that \r\nresolution, the Secretary-General is requested to \r\nestablish a group of governmental experts, to examine, \r\ncommencing in 2008, the feasibility, scope and draft \r\nparameters for reaching a binding instrument on the \r\nimport, export and transfer of conventional arms. There \r\nis still no agreement on the principle of drafting such \r\nan instrument, and the Secretariat can neither expand \r\nnor constrain the scope of its mandate until there has \r\nbeen a report by the group of experts on the matter.  \r\n We call for the enhancement of African \r\ninstitutions in the area of regional cooperation and \r\nintegration with a view to increasing trust and \r\npromoting economic relations that benefit all countries, \r\nincluding the attainment of better control of the \r\nexploitation of and trade in natural resources. \r\n Malaria causes more than a million deaths per \r\nyear. Eighty-six per cent of those deaths are in  \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. That means that we must try to \r\nreduce the mortality rate by 75 per cent by 2015. We \r\nlook forward to the publication of the World Malaria \r\nReport early next year and expect it to provide reliable \r\nindicators to assess the scale of infection, the success \r\nof the programmes implemented and the financial \r\nneeds. The preliminary indicators highlighted in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General note that malaria has \r\nthe highest association of any disease with poverty. \r\nThat in turn makes the elimination of poverty a major \r\nchallenge facing overall development and the \r\nelimination of this disease. That requires the \r\nparticipation of all of society, non-governmental \r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector. We \r\nneed to increase international assistance in order to \r\nfind flexible solutions that allow for the provision of \r\nhealth services to all segments of society. \r\n We need to find radical solutions to intellectual \r\nproperty issues regarding medications and new \r\nvaccines and ensure that we enhance national and \r\nregional capacities to combat malaria, particularly in \r\nAfrica. Malaria overburdens countries in Africa and \r\ncosts them $12 billion per year in lost gross domestic \r\nproduct. Egypt launched an initiative, with the African \r\nUnion, at the Sirte Summit in 2005, to establish an \r\nAfrican centre to promote cooperation and share \r\nexpertise in the fight against malaria in Africa. We \r\nhope that the centre’s efforts will be strengthened. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
