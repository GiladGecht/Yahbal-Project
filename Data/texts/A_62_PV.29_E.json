(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Ms. Bethel \r\n (Bahamas), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 64 and 47 (continued) \r\n \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support \r\n \r\n (a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and international \r\nsupport \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/203) \r\n \r\n (b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/204) \r\n \r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/321) \r\n \r\n Mr. Yousfi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to begin by thanking the Secretary-General for the \r\nreports made available to us on this agenda item and \r\nfor the very useful presentation of the reports. \r\n My delegation believes that the two reports of the \r\nSecretary-General are an excellent basis for our \r\ndeliberations on the causes of conflict and the annual \r\nreview of progress and support by the international \r\ncommunity for the implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). We \r\nare also pleased to note that considerable progress has \r\nbeen made with respect to peace, security and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\n With respect to security, which still is \r\nfundamental to the maintenance of peace and to long-\r\nterm development, we support the recommendations \r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa. The \r\nrecommendations stress the crucial and decisive need \r\nto allocate additional resources, both human and \r\nfinancial, to support the resources and effectiveness of \r\npeacekeeping operations conducted by the African \r\nUnion in Darfur, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n In this connection, Algeria is pleased to note the \r\nestablishment by the United Nations in 2006 of a cross-\r\ncutting programme that focuses on providing full \r\nsupport to African peacekeeping operations, and we \r\nwelcome the efforts made by the United Nations to \r\nreinforce the operational capacities of the African \r\nPeace and Security Council and its related institutions, \r\nsuch as the Panel of the Wise, the African standby \r\nforce and the Continental Early Warning System. \r\n Despite the positive trends, the report also draws \r\nour attention to the impact of complex problems \r\naffecting stability in Africa, in particular infectious \r\ndiseases, such as HIV/AIDS, the effects of global \r\nwarming and climate change, extremely high levels of \r\nunemployment among youth, trafficking in persons, \r\nmassive population shifts, the appearance of terrorist \r\nnetworks and growing transnational organized crime. \r\nA/62/PV.29  \r\n \r\n07-55407 2 \r\n \r\nAgainst this background, the new challenges to peace \r\nand security require a new approach based on African \r\ncapacities, a proper understanding of the problems, \r\npolitical will and strategic determination to restore \r\nownership of reconstruction and peacebuilding \r\nactivities to Africa. \r\n With respect to development-related activities, \r\nmy delegation agrees with the analysis and the \r\nconcerns voiced with respect to evaluating \r\ninternational support for the new programme for \r\nAfrica’s development. The assessment the Secretary-\r\nGeneral gives in his report points out that indeed, \r\ndespite significant initiatives and commitments \r\nundertaken by development partners following the \r\nMillennium Summit, such as the Group of Eight (G-8) \r\ndecision in Gleneagles on debt alleviation and official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), as well as the support \r\ngraciously provided by non-G-8 countries, most \r\nAfrican countries are, unfortunately, lagging \r\nsignificantly in implementing most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by the year 2015. \r\n The implementation of the multilateral and \r\nbilateral debt alleviation initiative, as well as progress \r\nmade in other areas, such as effective liberalization of \r\ninternational trade, the final arrangements of the Doha \r\nRound — these should be important stages in \r\nimplementing the objectives set by the international \r\ncommunity for development on the African continent. \r\n In order to do this, we believe it is important — \r\nindeed, imperative — for all of the international \r\ncommunity, in particular developed countries, to be \r\nmore closely involved and honour the commitments \r\nthat they undertook at the Millennium Summit in the \r\nyear 2000, as well as those of the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development in \r\nMonterrey in 2002, the World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in Johannesburg in 2002 and the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. \r\n The United Nations system must play a \r\nsignificant role in helping support African efforts to \r\ndevelop the continent. Such cooperation is essential in \r\norder to ensure a global framework for cooperation, \r\ninvolving solidarity and partnership and designed to \r\nmobilize the resources necessary to combat \r\nunderdevelopment and poverty and to reduce the \r\nwidening gap between North and South. \r\n Algeria has spared no effort in implementing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in its national \r\ndevelopment policy through specific actions and has \r\nalso worked within the NEPAD framework to promote \r\nall efforts designed to ensure development of the \r\nAfrican continent. The consolidation of reforms at the \r\ndomestic level via the enhancement of democracy and \r\nthe rule of law, which constitute important levers for \r\nachieving good governance, is part of the framework \r\nthat we are following in modernizing our State, our \r\neconomy and our society. \r\n It is in this spirit that Algeria has voluntarily \r\nsubmitted itself to peer review, under the African \r\nmechanism set up to this end. This initiative is \r\ndesigned for African countries to be able to make \r\nspecific contributions to enshrining good governance \r\nin each African country and on the continent as a \r\nwhole. A report was submitted to heads of States \r\nmembers of the African Peer Review Mechanism in \r\nAccra in June 2007; the report was noted very \r\npositively by our Mechanism, which was very pleased \r\nto see Algeria’s considerable progress in the economic, \r\nsocial and good governance areas. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to note with \r\nsatisfaction the growing number of African countries \r\nthat have voluntarily chosen to submit themselves to \r\nthis peer review mechanism, which is indeed a clear \r\nsuccess in the NEPAD initiative in promoting a real \r\nculture of good governance and peace on the continent. \r\n Mr. Swe (Myanmar): May I first of all take this \r\nopportunity to express my delegation’s deep gratitude \r\nto the President of the General Assembly, the Chairman \r\nof the Group of 77 and China, the Chair of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and \r\nall others for their messages of condolence on the \r\npassing away of His Excellency General Soe Win, \r\nPrime Minister of the Union of Myanmar. \r\n I wish also to extend our heartfelt condolences to \r\nthe Government and people of Pakistan on the tragic \r\nincident yesterday that resulted in the loss of life of \r\nover 120 people. Terrorism in any form or \r\nmanifestation must be condemned. \r\n I wish to thank the Secretary-General and the \r\nWorld Health Organization for their very useful \r\nreports. Myanmar fully associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Pakistan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China on this agenda \r\nitem. My delegation also associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Singapore on \r\nbehalf of the member States of ASEAN. \r\n A/62/PV.29\r\n \r\n3 07-55407 \r\n \r\n The statement of the President of the General \r\nAssembly has highlighted the deadly impact of malaria \r\non the world community, particularly on the African \r\ncontinent. Almost a million people have perished in \r\nAfrica owing to malaria — a situation that is \r\npreventable, provided the necessary resources are \r\nforthcoming. In addition to the human toll, the \r\neconomic cost of malaria to Africa is around \r\n$12 billion. This has negatively impacted on people’s \r\nhealth, as well as on the development prospects for the \r\nentire African continent. The status quo must not be \r\nallowed to continue. We strongly urge the international \r\ncommunity to provide effective assistance and \r\nadequate resources to advance the African Union and \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) health strategy. \r\n NEPAD is a mechanism that represents the \r\ncollective desire and commitment of the African \r\ncountries to meet the challenges they face, so that they \r\ncan achieve sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment. More importantly, it is a vision that \r\nencourages African countries to take charge of their \r\nown destiny by fighting poverty and promoting \r\ndevelopment. Notwithstanding the determined efforts \r\ntaken by African countries, the prognosis for the \r\ncontinent achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) by 2015 remains bleak, particularly in \r\nthe sub-Sahara region. \r\n The situation calls for action, not only on the part \r\nof the African continent but also by the international \r\ncommunity. Africa has demonstrated its commitment. \r\nThe international community must do its part. That \r\nwould entail further buttressing the Global Partnership \r\nfor Development and the implementation of \r\ndevelopment commitments fully and expeditiously.  \r\n We share the concern about the overall decline of \r\nOfficial Development Assistance (ODA) flows to \r\ndeveloping countries, including Africa. Commitments \r\nwere made by the Group of Eight at Gleneagles in \r\n2005 to double the aid to Africa by 2010. Despite a \r\n$2.3 billion increase in ODA for the period 2004-2006, \r\nthere is still a shortfall of some $3.5 billion, if the \r\npledge is to be implemented in full. Taking into \r\nconsideration the fresh commitment by the Group of \r\nEight at the Heiligendamm summit in 2007, we hope to \r\nsee the fulfilment of these commitments in full and on \r\ntime. \r\n Free trade is an engine of growth that can \r\nfacilitate the development roles of African countries. \r\nTo take full advantage of the benefits of free trade, \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly those in Africa, need \r\na favourable international economic environment. That \r\nis why we need the Doha Round to be brought to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion as soon as possible. To do that, \r\nwe need, among other things, to resolve issues that are \r\nof importance to developing countries, particularly \r\nissues affecting Africa, such as agricultural market \r\naccess and greater reduction in trade distorting \r\nagricultural subsidies. For developing countries, it is \r\nvital that they be in a position to participate effectively \r\nin the Doha Round negotiations. In this regard, my \r\ndelegation fully supports the request by African \r\ncountries for assistance in meeting sanitary and \r\ntechnical standards, and the costs of implementing \r\nother agreements of the World Trade Organization. \r\n By adopting the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), African leaders have \r\nreaffirmed their commitment to a common vision of \r\neradicating poverty in order to place their countries on \r\nthe path towards sustainable development. It is \r\nincumbent on the international community and the \r\nUnited Nations to help Africa. We are pleased that the \r\nUnited Nations is doing its part and that it remains an \r\nimportant pillar of international support for Africa. \r\nWhile important steps towards providing support to the \r\nAfrican Union and NEPAD have been taken in recent \r\nyears by the United Nations, it must seek to further \r\nstrengthen cooperation. \r\n In sum, NEPAD is a regional initiative in which \r\nAfrica will play a leading role. But without concerted \r\ninternational support, Africa will remain behind \r\nschedule in meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015. In this global village, we must work \r\ntogether and support African countries to achieve their \r\nworthy goals. \r\n Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda): First of all, I want to \r\npresent, on behalf of my delegation and on my own \r\nbehalf, our condolences to Myanmar and Pakistan. \r\n I would like express my delegation’s appreciation \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and to the World \r\nHealth Organization for their respective reports under \r\nconsideration today. \r\n Rwanda fully associates itself with the statements \r\nof the Group of 77 and China and the Group of the \r\nA/62/PV.29  \r\n \r\n07-55407 4 \r\n \r\nAfrican States. We have a few additional points to \r\nmake. \r\n The New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) is a vision to which Rwanda and other \r\nAfrican countries attach great importance. It is a vision \r\nthat offers the promise of Africa’s renewal and \r\ndevelopment, with highest priority being accorded to \r\nthe eradication of poverty, sustainable growth and \r\ndevelopment, integration into the global economy, and \r\nthe empowerment of women. It is an initiative led, \r\nowned and managed by the African Union that calls for \r\nand recognizes the serious commitment from and  \r\nthe implementation of programmes by African \r\nGovernments, as well as international support and \r\npartnership from development partner countries. \r\n We welcome the policy measures and actions \r\ntaken by African countries and organizations in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD in the areas of \r\ninfrastructure development, agriculture, health, \r\neducation, the environment, information and \r\ncommunication technology (ICT), science and \r\ntechnology, gender and peer review. Rwanda hosted the \r\nfirst country round table of the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme at which the \r\nRwanda Compact, representing a mutual commitment \r\nbetween Rwanda, the Commission of the African \r\nUnion, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern \r\nAfrica and development partners, was signed. The \r\nround table facilitated the undertaking of a \r\ncomprehensive study to define national targets for the \r\nProgramme and to delineate national policy challenges \r\nand support from ministries of finance and donors at \r\nthe country level. \r\n Rwanda was among the first countries to accede \r\nto and complete the peer review process under the \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism. We welcomed the \r\nviews and recommendations of the peer review panel \r\nand are working in a constructive spirit to implement \r\nreforms that will benefit the country. \r\n Rwanda is also proud to be an active participant \r\nin the NEPAD ICT vision. Rwanda was the first \r\ncountry to officially launch an e-schools initiative \r\nunder NEPAD in October 2006. We have also launched \r\na “One Laptop per Child” programme to be completed \r\nby 2012, a joint initiative between the Rwanda \r\nGovernment and leaders from the American private \r\nsector. Rwanda is also part of a 12-country initiative \r\ncalled the Kigali Protocol which aims to provide open \r\naccess and affordable prices for high quality, high-\r\nspeed and reliable electronic communications for end-\r\nusers. Additionally, we are also proud to be hosting the \r\n“Connect Africa” summit in Kigali at the end of this \r\nmonth. \r\n Rwanda welcomes the progress made so far in the \r\nimplementation of international commitments on debt \r\nrelief. Rwanda is a beneficiary of the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which has freed \r\nresources for use in social development programmes. \r\nWe also welcome progress on trade and South-South \r\ncooperation. \r\n However, much more work still needs to be done \r\nin order for developing countries to fulfil their official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) commitments. It is \r\ndisappointing that ODA declined in real terms in 2005 \r\nand stalled in 2006. There is concern that it will \r\ndecline even further in 2007.  \r\n Thus, the commitments of the Group of Eight \r\ncountries in 2005 at Gleneagles to double aid to Africa \r\nby 2010 will become a challenge to fulfil. We therefore \r\nagree with the Secretary-General’s assessment that \r\nthere is need for new aid architecture based on closer \r\ncoordination, greater harmonization, less fragmentation \r\nand better allocation of aid, as well as a genuine \r\ncommitment to deliver on pledges.  \r\n The special needs of Africa are of such \r\nimportance that they require the sustained attention of \r\nthe United Nations. Rwanda therefore supports the \r\nconvening of a high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs during the sixty-third session. We \r\nbelieve that this meeting will help focus attention on \r\nAfrica’s unique challenges. We look forward to the \r\nsupport of all Member States for that meeting.  \r\n With respect to United Nations support for \r\nNEPAD, it is critical that the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser on Africa, which oversees support for NEPAD, \r\nbe strengthened. The Office is of great importance to \r\nAfrica and plays a very important role in coordinating \r\ninternational support. The Office therefore cannot \r\ncontinue to fulfil the important mandate the General \r\nAssembly has assigned to it without a substantive head \r\nat the Under-Secretary-General level. We therefore \r\nwish to reiterate the call of the African Group for that \r\npost and other vacancies in the Office to be filled as \r\nsoon as possible.  \r\n A/62/PV.29\r\n \r\n5 07-55407 \r\n \r\n Regarding agenda item 64 (b) “Causes of conflict \r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa”, I wish to acknowledge \r\nAfrica’s contributions to peace and security in the \r\nregion. The African Peace and Security Architecture \r\nhas been established, comprising the African Union \r\n(AU) Peace and Security Council, a Panel of the Wise, \r\na continental early-warning system and the beginnings \r\nof an African standby force. Those elements have \r\nalready played a very constructive role in promoting \r\npeace and security in the region, and will continue to \r\ndo so. Their capacities will be strengthened by the  \r\n10-year United Nations capacity-building programme \r\nfor the African Union, which envisages, inter alia, \r\nenhanced cooperation in all phases of conflict \r\nmanagement, early warning and preventive  \r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peacekeeping, post-conflict \r\nreconstruction, peacebuilding and human rights.  \r\n Rwanda is proud to contribute to these efforts, \r\nboth through the AU Peace and Security Council and \r\nthrough troop and police contributions to the AU and \r\nthe United Nations. We welcome the recommendations \r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report on item \r\n64 (b) (A/62/204) and look forward to their \r\nimplementation, especially in terms of capacity-\r\nbuilding. \r\n Malaria imposes an unacceptable toll on the most \r\nvulnerable people, mostly in Africa, which accounts for \r\n90 per cent of malaria deaths. The disease compounds \r\nthe effects of poverty, weakening productive \r\npopulations and thereby reducing their economic \r\nproductivity. Yet the disease is preventable. We \r\nwelcome the efforts of development partners in \r\nsupporting Africa in confronting this problem. Also, we \r\nmust commend private initiatives like that of the Bill \r\nand Melinda Gates Foundation, whose support for a \r\nmalaria vaccine has begun to yield positive results. \r\n However, the World Health Organization report \r\nacknowledges that there is still a chronic lack of \r\nfunding and capacity to support prevention \r\nprogrammes, such as those promoting insecticidal nets \r\nand indoor residual spraying. There is also a lack of \r\nfunding for research. We must work together to address \r\nthis problem so that malaria ceases to be such a \r\nchallenge to socio-economic development in Africa. \r\n Mr. Constantino (Angola): Allow me first to say \r\nthat my delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of Pakistan and Benin \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the African \r\nGroup respectively.  \r\n We take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his fifth consolidated report on the \r\nprogress in implementation of and international \r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/62/203), as well as for the \r\nreport on the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Especially in Africa (A/62/321). \r\n NEPAD represents a unique opportunity to meet \r\nthe special needs of Africa through a global \r\npartnership. The success of this partnership is greatly \r\ndependant upon the degree to which each stakeholder \r\nhonours its respective commitments. In this \r\nconnection, my delegation is pleased with the progress \r\nachieved thus far, but remains convinced that our \r\nefforts remain insufficient and have not reached the \r\nlimits of our abilities. This is evidenced by the fact that \r\nAfrica remains the sole continent not on track to meet \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n During the past year, African leaders, the NEPAD \r\nsecretariat and development partners have engaged in a \r\nvariety of forums aimed at developing national, \r\nsubregional and regional projects in priority areas, such \r\nas agriculture, health, education and infrastructure; \r\nmany of these are awaiting funding. In that connection, \r\nmy delegation is of the view that if we are to succeed \r\nin achieving sustained economic growth and \r\nsustainable development in Africa, through which we \r\ncan eradicate poverty and hunger, substantial progress \r\nis required in the following areas. \r\n First, we have to recognize that the challenge for \r\ndevelopment partners is to shift their assistance \r\nframeworks from humanitarian and emergency \r\nassistance to predictable quantitative and qualitative \r\nincreases in development assistance in the social and \r\neconomic areas. Secondly, we must all do our share to \r\ngreatly improve the effectiveness of development \r\nassistance, while recognizing that that cannot be \r\nachieved without tackling the coordination of policies, \r\nmeasures and rules at all levels. Thirdly, we must all do \r\nmore to honour our commitments. Scaling up aid \r\ninvolves the provision of additional adequate and \r\nsustained funding to meet the development needs of \r\nAfrica. Finally, the international community should \r\nsupport reconstruction efforts aimed at economic \r\ncompetitiveness and capacity-building in the African \r\nprivate sector. \r\nA/62/PV.29  \r\n \r\n07-55407 6 \r\n \r\n The objectives and action plans enunciated in \r\nNEPAD are consistent with internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, and a global partnership is required \r\nfor their achievement. My delegation is of the view \r\nthat the United Nations has a very important role to \r\nplay in that connection.  \r\n Within the United Nations system and beyond, a \r\nkey function of the unique partnership to meet the \r\nspecial needs of Africa is maintaining the integrity of \r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser on Africa. In addition \r\nto playing its advocacy role, the Office can monitor to \r\nensure that coordinated planning, monitoring, \r\nimplementation and evaluation of activities is being \r\ncarried out by the entire United Nations system, as \r\ndirected by heads of State in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1) and the outcomes of the \r\nmajor United Nations conferences in the economic and \r\nsocial fields.  \r\n In conclusion, my delegation looks forward to the \r\nurgent filling of all existing vacancies in the Office of \r\nthe Special Adviser on Africa. We consider that to be \r\ncritical to the implementation of NEPAD.  \r\n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): My delegation is grateful to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his two reports — one on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\n(A/62/203) and the other relating to causes of conflict \r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/62/204) — submitted, \r\nrespectively, under sub-items (a) and (b) of agenda \r\nitem 64. Those two detailed documents are full of \r\ninformation and very enlightening, particularly with \r\nregard to the international community’s fulfilment of \r\nits commitments vis-à-vis Africa. \r\n The reports also shed light on the resolve of \r\nAfrican countries themselves to intervene in conflicts \r\nin order to maintain peace and — to borrow the \r\nSecretary-General’s excellent phrase — to achieve a \r\nconflict-free Africa. In fact, at the continental and \r\nsubregional levels, they have developed a Peace and \r\nSecurity Architecture supported by mechanisms \r\ndesigned to predict, prevent, manage and resolve \r\nconflicts. The delegation of Cameroon hopes that the \r\npeace and security architecture developed by the \r\nEconomic Community of Central African States will be \r\nduly described in the next report, as the mechanisms of \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States and \r\nthe Southern African Development Community are in \r\nthe current one.  \r\n It is with the same concern to strengthen their \r\nsecurity capacity that African countries are developing \r\nschools and centres for peacekeeping training. Thus, in \r\naddition to the centres in Mali and Ghana, there will \r\nsoon be an international school in Cameroon. United \r\nNations Member States are invited to hear a \r\npresentation about the school on Monday, 22 October \r\n2007, at 11 a.m. in Conference Room 3.  \r\n We also thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nquality of the statement that he made as we began our \r\nconsideration of this item. It was a strong and detailed \r\nstatement. It encouraged us, because the Secretary-\r\nGeneral confirmed that Africa and its special needs are \r\nthe top priority for him. Africa is pleased to find in him \r\nan advocate who is convincing because he is \r\nconvinced.  \r\n These two reports clearly show the scope and \r\ndiversity of the activities carried out by African \r\ncountries and the international community to \r\nimplement NEPAD, as well as recommendations aimed \r\nat making Africa a conflict-free zone of peace. While \r\nefforts on all sides have made commendable progress, \r\nthe situation in Africa remains worrisome. The results \r\nachieved to date remain far from commonly accepted \r\ngoals and objectives. In a moving plea, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Benin, His Excellency \r\nMr. Jean-Marie Ehouzou, speaking in his capacity as \r\nChairman of the Group of African States, described the \r\nsituation much more effectively than I could. I thank \r\nhim for his persuasive power and his eloquence in the \r\nservice of Africa. \r\n In any case, the task before us is immense. So too \r\nis the resolve that we must demonstrate if we really \r\nwant to move decisively towards the results that we \r\nhope to achieve. From that perspective, the United \r\nNations has an essential role to play, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral recalled here yesterday in his introductory \r\nstatement (see A/62/PV.27). The peoples of the United \r\nNations who are in Africa expect the Organization to \r\nplay a role within the international community that \r\nencourages, mobilizes and coordinates contributions \r\nand initiatives to supplement the efforts of African \r\ncountries.  \r\n The Secretary-General has understood that well. \r\nSince he assumed his duties, he has shown that he is \r\n A/62/PV.29\r\n \r\n7 07-55407 \r\n \r\ndeeply involved in seeking solutions to African issues. \r\nIn his report, he wrote: \r\n  “Appropriate and adequate institutional \r\narrangements within the United Nations will hold \r\nthe key to the success of our efforts in support of \r\nAfrica. I intend to revamp these efforts by \r\nestablishing greater institutional coherence \r\namong the main Secretariat entities dealing with \r\nissues that concern Africa, as well as establishing \r\nstronger system-wide organizational \r\narrangements to ensure full implementation of \r\nactivities in favour of Africa. As part of this \r\napproach I will seek to formulate strategic actions \r\nfor the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity in support of achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment in a conflict-free Africa.” (A/62/204, \r\npara. 79) \r\n This brings me back to the need to strengthen the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General \r\non Africa. As we said on 9 October from this rostrum, \r\nthat Office, as an operational structure, has three roles. \r\nIt must mobilize public opinion and resources, \r\ncoordinate the various initiatives within the United \r\nNations system for implementing NEPAD, and follow \r\nup actively on the various contributions made by the \r\nTokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment, the China-Africa Forum, the Group of 8, \r\nthe European Union and, more recently, India, the \r\nRepublic of Korea and Brazil towards a more \r\ninnovative North-South or South-South partnership for \r\nthe development of Africa. \r\n The Office could be strengthened in the following \r\nmanner, although this is not an exhaustive list of \r\npossible measures. The first would be preserving the \r\nintegrity and high level of the Office, allowing it to \r\noperate in an integrated manner and at an appropriate \r\nlevel of representation and dialogue with its various \r\npartners as it plays the strategic triple role I referred to \r\nearlier. \r\n The second measure would be filling all the \r\nvacancies in the Office, and particularly the post of \r\nSpecial Adviser. If that post remains vacant, it will \r\nclearly weaken the Office’s management and \r\nleadership and hinder the implementation of \r\nprogrammes. In their reports to this session, the \r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination and the \r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary \r\nQuestions stress that point clearly. \r\n The third measure would be enhancing the \r\nOffice’s capacity to play its triple role. In that \r\nconnection, we believe that it would be wise to create \r\nadditional posts and operational resources, as the \r\nSecretary-General proposes, in other priority areas, \r\nsuch as disarmament, the maintenance of peace, human \r\nrights and, in the near future, political affairs. That \r\ncapacity is all the more necessary in that the specific \r\nneeds of Africa, as identified by the heads of State and \r\nGovernment at the 2000 Millennium Summit and the \r\n2005 World Summit, must be duly planned, \r\nprogrammed, followed up and assessed in a strategic \r\nand concrete manner in the annual or multi-year work \r\nplans of the United Nations system. Moreover, the \r\nvarious processes launched by Africa’s partners must \r\nalso be followed up and exploited methodically. \r\n The fourth and last measure is clarifying the role \r\nof the Office of the Special Adviser vis-à-vis other \r\nSecretariat entities. Such clarification would avoid any \r\npotential duplication and other confusion. If properly \r\norganized, the Office would work in synergy with other \r\nentities of the system, but would also have a unique \r\ncentral role that would highlight both its added value \r\nand its own distinct nature. \r\n My delegation makes these proposals because we \r\nshould like our current debate to lead to conclusions \r\nthat would enable the Secretary-General to propose a \r\nset of measures to strengthen the programmes, \r\nadministrative structure and budget that support the \r\nUnited Nations work for enhanced development in \r\nAfrica. Indeed, that is what the General Assembly has \r\ncalled for tirelessly in the Second, Third and Fifth \r\nCommittees and other subsidiary bodies.  \r\n It is seven years to the deadline of 2015. At that \r\npoint, we will assess how far peoples have travelled \r\ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThe reports before us, unfortunately, show that Africa \r\nis unlikely to meet those goals if its development \r\npartners do not live up to all of their commitments \r\nwithin the agreed time frame.  \r\n Yesterday, the General Assembly began the \r\ndebate, ending today, on the reports on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. In our view, the backdrop to this debate \r\nis very meaningful because our meeting is taking place \r\nshortly after two major events. The first was the \r\ncommemoration by men of good will throughout the \r\nworld of the fortieth anniversary of Pope Paul VI’s \r\nencyclical Populorum Progressio. That prophetic \r\nA/62/PV.29  \r\n \r\n07-55407 8 \r\n \r\nencyclical on the progress of peoples is more relevant \r\ntoday than ever. It offered a new approach to the \r\nexpectations of the poorest peoples and countries \r\namong us. Today, more than ever before, development \r\nis indeed the new name of peace. If we seek peace, we \r\nshould not prepare for war; we should fight poverty. If \r\nwe want peace, we should work for respect for all \r\nhuman rights, including the right to development and \r\nthe right to food.  \r\n The backdrop to the debate ending today is also \r\nsymbolic because our deliberations are taking place \r\nshortly after 17 October, when we marked a day set \r\naside to reject poverty throughout the world. As \r\nmembers know, 17 October was established by the \r\nGeneral Assembly as the International Day for the \r\nEradication of Poverty. On that occasion, Pope \r\nBenedict XVI called upon men and women to act in \r\nthree key areas: first, to work even harder to eliminate \r\nthe causes of poverty and its tragic consequences; \r\nsecondly, to call on their sense of dignity to find \r\ngrounds for rejecting what is unacceptable and to find \r\nthe strength to believe in a better future and the joy of \r\nhelping one another; and thirdly, to fight side by side, \r\nin a generous spirit, against poverty.  \r\n Let us heed that appeal as we conclude our debate \r\non development and peace in Africa. The end of this \r\ndebate must mean the beginning of an effective and \r\ncomplete implementation of our commitments. The \r\nsituation in Africa calls for greater creativity in finding \r\nsolutions, greater resolve in the actions to be \r\nundertaken and greater generosity in implementing \r\nthose actions. Africa is the continent of the future, and \r\nwhen Africa awakens, it will remember its good \r\nSamaritans. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the Observer State of the Holy See.  \r\n Monsignor Auza (Holy See): Resolutions 61/229 \r\nand 61/230 and the reports of the Secretary-General \r\nhighlight many positive signs of the commitment of the \r\npeoples and Governments of Africa to act as \r\nprotagonists in the promotion of peace and of their own \r\neconomic and social development. They also express \r\nthe international community’s responsibilities towards \r\nAfrica. \r\n Figures showing accelerated economic growth in \r\nAfrica as a whole during the past years are particularly \r\nencouraging. That was best exemplified by last year’s \r\ngrowth rate, which was the highest in the last 30 years. \r\nIt is therefore with pleasure that my delegation salutes \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) in its seventh year of existence. This Africa-\r\nowned and Africa-led vision and strategic framework \r\nfor Africa’s renewal has contributed in no small \r\nmeasure to this growth. Moreover, although designed \r\nto address the challenges facing the continent through \r\ncloser cooperation among the African countries, \r\nNEPAD also opens and prepares Africa for greater \r\ninternational cooperation. Indeed, one of its primary \r\nobjectives is to halt the marginalization of Africa in the \r\nglobalization process and enhance its full and \r\nbeneficial integration into the global economy. Africa \r\nhas started to reap the fruit of this wise decision, as \r\nseen in the aforementioned highest growth rate, which \r\nwas in part due to favourable international economic \r\nconditions. \r\n Nevertheless, these positive signs stand in stark \r\ncontrast with situations of conflict and the reality of \r\nextreme forms of poverty, which are difficult to uproot. \r\nAfrica still lags behind most other regions of the world. \r\nThus the international community’s support remains a \r\ndecisive factor in assisting Africa in responding to \r\ndaunting challenges and in consolidating recent gains. \r\n In the area of peace and security, the Holy See \r\nwishes to renew its support for a global approach to the \r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts in \r\nAfrica. Efforts in those areas should be guided by the \r\nPeace and Security Council of the African Union, \r\nassisted by the Panel of the Wise and the African \r\nstandby force. Initiatives such as the continental early \r\nwarning system and the regional conflict warning \r\nsystems deserve the international community’s \r\ngenerous support, so that the continent’s increasing \r\nassumption of its share of responsibility in conflict \r\nprevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding may be further consolidated. \r\n In the socio-economic field, there is no need to \r\nlook far and wide for ways and means to support \r\nAfrica: in resolution 61/229, paragraphs 19 to 25, \r\nseveral are enumerated. To address the challenges of \r\npoverty eradication and sustainable development, \r\nAfrica would need a comprehensive solution to the \r\nunsustainable debt burdens of some countries, fairer \r\naccess to world markets through equitable integration \r\ninto the international trading system, the timely \r\ndisbursement by the developed countries of the agreed \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product as official \r\ndevelopment assistance, better harmonization between \r\n A/62/PV.29\r\n \r\n9 07-55407 \r\n \r\ninternational support and NEPAD priorities, greater \r\nand long-term investments in Africa’s public and \r\nprivate sector, transfer of technology and better \r\neducational and health systems, to cite a few. \r\n Africa’s integration into the international trading \r\nsystem should help it build its capacity to compete \r\nwithout reducing its ability to safeguard its citizens \r\nfrom the undesirable consequences of structural \r\nadjustments and trade liberalization. The international \r\ncommunity is called upon to assist African countries in \r\ndeveloping policies that promote a culture of solidarity, \r\nso that their economic development may go hand in \r\nhand with integral human development. On the other \r\nhand, good governance and institution-building efforts, \r\nthe correct use of aid and anti-corruption measures are \r\nprimary responsibilities of the recipient countries and \r\nare essential if international aid is to bear fruit. \r\n At the end of the day, any new trade \r\ndevelopment — particularly the new North-South \r\nregional agreements — must improve on what is \r\nalready in place and must avoid imposing conditions to \r\nthe detriment of Africans. One sector that is vital to \r\nAfrica’s capacity to both ensure its food security and \r\ncompete in the global economy is agriculture, as seen \r\nin the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies in \r\ndeveloped countries. An equitable solution to the \r\nimbalances in international agricultural trade is \r\nurgently needed, as is an approach to the subsidies on \r\nexports from developed countries that is consistent \r\nwith and satisfactory for African agriculture. \r\n Education must be at the heart of NEPAD \r\nobjectives and priorities, not only as a goal in itself but \r\nalso as a means in achieving the other objectives. \r\nStrategic partnerships in education and skills formation \r\nbetween institutions in Africa and in the developed \r\nworld will no doubt accelerate progress in all sectors. \r\n Those partnerships should extend to the \r\nmovement of skilled labour. Africa, in fact, is suffering \r\nfrom brain drain, as much of its educated, talented and \r\nskilled human capital — especially in the health \r\nsector — leave the continent for better economic \r\nopportunities in rich countries. There is real risk, \r\ntherefore, that the hard-earned investments in African \r\nhigher education will yield fewer and fewer returns to \r\nAfrica, even while it benefits countries where African \r\nskilled labour is being employed. \r\n Persistent wars in Africa and their deleterious \r\neffects in terms of the displaced and refugees and of \r\nthe heinous crimes of the recruitment of child soldiers \r\nand violence against women, should remind us that \r\npeace and collective security are inseparable from \r\nhuman development. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, \r\nI now call on the observer for the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  \r\n Ms. Johnson (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): I am pleased to be \r\nable to speak here today on matters of particular \r\nrelevance to the International Federation of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  \r\n The largest humanitarian needs resulting from \r\npoverty, health crises and disasters are in Africa, and it \r\nis with grave concern that we remind ourselves today, \r\nat the mid-point to 2015, that most African countries \r\nare not on track to meet most, if not all, of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). People are \r\ndying of AIDS and related diseases, leaving behind \r\ndestitute families and children, many also \r\nHIV-positive. Droughts, floods, locusts and conflicts \r\ncause or exacerbate food insecurity and vulnerability to \r\ndisease. Having witnessed the recent and \r\nunprecedented flooding that affected one million \r\npeople across 20 African countries over the past \r\nseveral months, we are all the more concerned about \r\nrising humanitarian needs and the long-term toll they \r\ntake on years of development gains. \r\n It is unacceptable that today, l9 October, \r\n3,000 children will die of malaria. It is unacceptable \r\nthat 14 African children will die during the few \r\nminutes it will take for me to make this statement here \r\nin the General Assembly. It is all the more \r\nunacceptable given that those deaths can be prevented \r\nthrough personal protection, mosquito control and \r\nearly treatment. Today, malaria threatens 40 per cent of \r\nthe world’s population, and we expect that figure to \r\nincrease as climate and environmental changes take it \r\ninto new territories. \r\n The New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) aims to eradicate poverty and place African \r\ncountries on a path of sustainable growth and \r\ndevelopment, including meeting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in health and education. The \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies endorses those priorities and also \r\nworks towards them. Our programmes in Africa \r\nA/62/PV.29  \r\n \r\n07-55407 10 \r\n \r\naccount for 40 per cent of our funding appeal in 2006 \r\nand 2007.  \r\n The positive news is that, by working in strong \r\nglobal and local partnerships and by building the local \r\ncapacities of national Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties, we see progress being made in many African \r\ncountries by Africans themselves. Indeed, despite the \r\ndaunting humanitarian needs, there is progress in \r\nAfrica, and we have registered many achievements. \r\nToday, I will highlight simply one. \r\n The report recently issued by the United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund on malaria and children shows that a \r\nrapid improvement in the supply and distribution of \r\nmosquito nets between 2004 and 2006 has resulted in a \r\ntripling of coverage ratios in 16 countries. Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies have contributed to those \r\nresults as partners of the Roll Back Malaria initiative. \r\nOur community-based volunteers, who walk the last \r\nmile and visit the last house on the road, have helped \r\nturn planned campaigns into real successes. In 2006, \r\nthe International Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies participated in 17 malaria \r\ncampaigns in 14 countries, helping to distribute some \r\n27 million mosquito nets. By the end of this year, we \r\nanticipate having completed 13 new campaigns and \r\ndelivered 28 million nets. Preparations are currently \r\nunder way in Madagascar, Mali, Gabon, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Congo Brazzaville \r\nand Gambia. In 2008, we plan to continue at that pace \r\nand anticipate needing some 21 million more nets.  \r\n We believe that NEPAD is founded on two key \r\nprinciples that are necessary to achieving results in \r\nAfrica. The first is anchoring the development of \r\nAfrica in its own resources and in the resourcefulness \r\nof its people. The International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies recognizes that the \r\nlack of human resources for health is a cause of major \r\nhealth delivery gaps, particularly in rural areas of \r\nsub-Saharan African countries. We see that as an \r\nimportant impediment to achieving the MDGs and as \r\nan area where we can contribute. \r\n As auxiliaries to their public authorities, Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies can help improve the \r\nquality and size of the health workforce in their \r\ncountries, while recognizing the Government’s \r\nresponsibility in that area. That is why the IFRC, in \r\ncooperation with the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) and the Southern Africa HIV/AIDS \r\nInformation Dissemination Service, has developed a \r\ngeneric training package on HIV/AIDS, which can be \r\nused to train community volunteers in treatment \r\nliteracy, mobilization, preparedness and adherence. \r\n The key to success is partnership. As auxiliaries \r\nto their public authorities, national Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies are ideally placed to help \r\naccomplish the humanitarian goals of their \r\nGovernments at all levels. As community-based \r\norganizations, they can help link development at the \r\nnational level to the efforts at the local level of \r\neveryday people working to improve their lives. We \r\nbelieve that for partnerships to be real, equitable and \r\ntransparent, they need to respond to the aspirations and \r\nexpectations of vulnerable people and communities. \r\n National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \r\nwelcome partnerships with organizations working \r\ntowards similar goals. We believe that for partnerships \r\nto be effective, they need to be built on solid \r\norganizational capacity, on complementary skills, and \r\non the maximization of resources. The memorandum of \r\nunderstanding signed between the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \r\nand the WHO’s Regional Office for Africa in May of \r\nthis year is one example of such a partnership and is a \r\nmilestone that should help better support the efforts of \r\nAfrican Governments in scaling up comprehensive \r\nHIV interventions at the community level.  \r\n I have outlined today how health interventions, \r\ninstitutional and human capacity-building, and \r\npartnerships at national and local levels can spur \r\ndevelopment in Africa. Those issues will be addressed \r\nat the upcoming International Conference of the Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent which, under the theme \r\n“Together for humanity”, will draw attention to the \r\nneed for collective and collaborative action and \r\npartnerships between States, the Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent global network, and other humanitarian \r\nactors, such as the United Nations and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. The International \r\nConference will also examine the unique value and \r\nspecific nature of the role of national societies as \r\nauxiliaries to the public authorities in the humanitarian \r\nfield. \r\n Let me close by highlighting two areas in which \r\nwe think Governments can act differently and more \r\neffectively to enable our work and shared goals. \r\n A/62/PV.29\r\n \r\n11 07-55407 \r\n \r\n First, they can better partner with national Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies. We call on donor \r\nand national Governments to meet the intentions stated \r\nin the Rabat Declaration on human development and on \r\nstrengthening health systems and human resources for \r\nhealth, in cooperation with national Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies. \r\n Secondly, there is the question of funding and \r\nresource mobilization. As highlighted in the many \r\nreports that fed into our discussions yesterday and \r\ntoday, funding remains inadequate to effectively tackle \r\nthe challenges of malaria, HIV and development in \r\nAfrica. We call on Governments to mobilize resources \r\nand funding to that end and to apply the principles and \r\ngood practice of humanitarian donorship in the \r\nefficient delivery of that assistance. \r\n The International Federation of Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent Societies and our 53 national societies in \r\nAfrica know too well the daily difficulties and \r\ntragedies of poor families and communities in Africa. \r\nBut we also know — because our national societies are \r\ngrounded in that reality — the tremendous strength and \r\ncapacity that are in those same families and those same \r\ncommunities. We are convinced that, working in global \r\nand local partnerships, we can achieve our goals, and \r\nwe pledge to do our part to do just that. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items. The Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 64 and 47. \r\nThe meeting rose at 4.20 p.m. \r\n"
