Many \r\ncountries are lagging behind in reaching many of the \r\nMDGs, so we need to step up our efforts and keep our \r\npromises. Many Group of Seven countries and new \r\nemerging donors have not come up with additional \r\nfinancing. Official development assistance (ODA) in \r\nthe past year decreased; the trade negotiations that \r\npromised to finalize a so-called development round are \r\nstalled; many countries still have to wait for the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative \r\n(HIPC) process of debt reduction to be dealt with; and \r\nmany developing countries have not yet stepped up \r\ntheir efforts to invest in human development. \r\n This morning, the Secretary-General signalled a \r\nmixed picture of progress and setbacks in his report on \r\nthe follow-up to the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development. Serious work and \r\nresponsibilities lie ahead for all of us. \r\n Today we are witnessing growing inequality \r\nbetween and within States. The world economy is \r\ngrowing, which is a crucially positive development, but \r\nat the same time we are faced with three fundamental \r\nchallenges — first, poverty and the unequal \r\ndistribution of wealth; secondly, poverty and climate \r\nchange; and thirdly, poverty and the unequal \r\ndistribution of security. These three challenges are \r\ninterlinked in a complex manner. Our efforts should \r\nfocus on solving all three fundamental challenges by \r\nacting urgently. \r\n This must be done by, first, by stepping up our \r\nefforts. In the countries where the MDGs are off track, \r\nmeasures have to be taken in the domestic arena to \r\nensure progress in fields such as progressive taxation, \r\ndemocratic accountability and transparency. In support \r\nof these national efforts, international efforts, both \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 2 \r\n \r\nthrough transfer of funds and through meaningful \r\npolitical dialogue, can and should also play a role of \r\ngreater importance. The Netherlands has been a \r\nconsistent 0.8 per cent donor for decades, and we have \r\nadded in the new cabinet period 700 million euros \r\nextra to start addressing the environmental adaptation \r\nagenda for least developed countries. In spite of all the \r\npromises made in the past few years, including those \r\nmade in this arena, worldwide development aid even \r\ndropped by five per cent last year. \r\n As the international community, let us implement \r\nthe Monterrey agreement. We fall way short of our \r\ntargets. If we are to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, we need to reverse this trend. The \r\nEuropean Union (EU) decision to raise its ODA level \r\nin accordance with specific targets and a timetable for \r\nthe coming years can now be realized. We expect more \r\nG-7 and non-traditional donor countries to join us in \r\ndelivering the agreed 0.7 per cent United Nations \r\ntarget. \r\n Secondly, the enhancement of the quality and \r\neffectiveness of our ODA spending is at least as \r\nimportant as the levels of spending. Over the years, the \r\ninternational aid architecture has become increasingly \r\ncomplex. Funding decisions and budget allocations are \r\nincreasingly linked to performance and accompanied \r\nby demands for more transparency and better \r\naccountability. Also, we need to limit conditionality to \r\nkey areas only. This is positive and very much needed, \r\nbut major challenges remain, as also signalled by the \r\nSecretary-General this morning — effective ownership, \r\nlower transaction costs and predictability of aid, less \r\nbureaucracy and fewer endless rules, regulations and \r\nreports. I really call on United Nations agencies to \r\nreverse this negative trend of more and more \r\npaperwork. What really counts are results on the \r\nground, in the country. The monitoring of results and \r\nfollow-up of mutual commitments at country level are \r\nessential, but this requires, first and foremost, strong \r\nleadership and the involvement of parliaments and civil \r\nsociety — that is, the people on the ground. We have to \r\nmake sure that in Accra, next September, the Paris \r\nDeclaration can be taken a step further — towards \r\ndouble accountability, and this will require political \r\nleadership. \r\n But even more stable and predictable funding is \r\nnot enough. I will increase the amount of multi-year \r\ncore funding for United Nations organizations that \r\nperform well and, in the near future, for “One United \r\nNations” country programmes. I call on all donor \r\ncountries to do the same. In this light, I look forward to \r\ncontributing to the elaboration of principles of good \r\nmultilateral donorship. \r\n The third challenge concerns trade. Trade and \r\nphased integration into the regional and world \r\neconomies are essential preconditions for economic \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The poorest \r\ncountries need to be supported with their integration \r\ninto the world trade system, but we must allow them to \r\nprotect their own markets for some time against the \r\nsometimes unfair competition that affects vulnerable \r\nsectors, the development of rural areas and food \r\nsecurity. \r\n Since Monterrey, more challenges have been \r\nfacing us. Global security issues and climate change \r\nplace us before new hurdles on our way to MDG \r\nrealization. We have to re-think our financing \r\nmechanisms to stay ahead of these developments. I \r\nwould, in conclusion, like to share my ideas on these \r\nissues with you as food for thought for our discussion. \r\n First, when it comes to climate change, we have \r\nto bear in mind that the poorest countries are the main \r\nvictims of the more extreme weather conditions, \r\ndroughts and floods. A temperature rise of only two \r\ndegrees will destroy the coffee sector that is so crucial \r\nto Uganda, for instance, a country I visited only a few \r\nmonths ago. I consider this issue to be of great \r\nimportance to the Monterrey review. How can we \r\nimprove our responses to climate change? What does it \r\nmean for our levels and ways of ODA spending and \r\nother financial mechanisms? At the G-8 meeting in \r\nHeiligendamm in Germany, some steps were taken in \r\nthe right direction in terms of seriously considering the \r\ngoal of 50 per cent fewer emissions by 2050. I hope \r\nthat at the United Nations climate summit at Bali later \r\nthis year, we will see this constructive attitude turned \r\ninto substantive action. But it is also is a matter of \r\nrestructuring our financial flows, taking new \r\ninnovative steps and forming public-private \r\npartnerships. We cannot do it in the same ways that we \r\nhave done it up until now. I hope we will be able and \r\nwilling to answer some of the questions ahead of us in \r\ntime for our meeting one year from now in Doha, \r\nQatar, on the bases of the polluter pays principle, \r\nshared responsibility and additionality. \r\n When it comes to fragile States, we should \r\nrecognize that the majority of the world’s billion \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n3 07-55833 \r\n \r\npeople living at the bottom in sheer misery are in these \r\nStates. Effective assistance to these States is still \r\nlacking. There is not enough money, nor is there \r\neffective cooperation in multi-donor trust funds or \r\nbetween development, diplomacy and defence. This is \r\nunacceptable. I just came back from the Sudan, and I \r\nsee how much work we still have to do to improve \r\nthese multi-donor trust funds. \r\n In Doha next year, we will be obliged to show the \r\nworld that we have not taken our previous promises for \r\ngranted. New developments and challenges have to be \r\ntaken into account. Emerging issues, such as \r\ninnovative finance, new donors, harmonization, South-\r\nSouth cooperation, to mention just a few, need to be \r\ncarefully studied and selected to be dealt with \r\nsubstantively in Doha. \r\n Sometimes, we are puzzled by the complexity of \r\nthe matters we discuss. However, complexity must \r\nnever be an excuse for passivity. The Netherlands, \r\ntherefore, remains committed to actively participate in \r\nand contribute to the financing for development \r\nprocess. We call on everyone to step up their efforts. \r\nThe world is more and more characterized by political, \r\neconomic and cultural fault lines. This is no longer \r\nacceptable. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Kwadwo Baah-Wiredu, Minister of Finance and \r\nEconomic Planning of Ghana. \r\n Mr. Baah-Wiredu (Ghana): It is a privilege for \r\nme and my delegation to participate in this important \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. \r\nThe theme could not have come at a better time, \r\nparticularly as we prepare for the Doha conference in \r\n2008. \r\n Ghana aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Pakistan on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n In the year 2001, world leaders gathered in \r\nMonterrey and resolved to address the challenges of \r\nfinancing for development around the world, \r\nparticularly in developing countries. The goal of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus was to eradicate poverty, achieve \r\nsustained economic growth and promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Consensus is based on the contemporary \r\nview that international cooperation for development \r\nshould be viewed as a partnership between developed \r\nand developing countries. Developing countries must \r\naccept primary responsibility for their development, \r\nincluding strengthening governance, combating \r\ncorruption and putting policies and investments in \r\nplace to drive economic growth and employment, \r\nthereby maximizing domestic resources available to \r\nfund national development strategies. Developed \r\ncountries, for their part, are to provide the support that \r\ndeveloping countries need, in the form of increased \r\ndevelopment assistance, development-oriented trade \r\nsystems, wider and deeper debt relief and increased \r\nprivate financing. \r\n A considerable number of developing countries \r\nare making tremendous strides towards achieving the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). I want to \r\nassure the Assembly that Ghana will achieve Goal 1 by \r\nthe end of 2008. Our efforts have also received \r\nencouraging support from development partners, \r\nparticularly in the area of debt relief, which has seen \r\nimprovements, especially since 2005. \r\n Despite those achievements, challenges remain. \r\nThe world is still confronted by acute and increasing \r\nsocial and economic inequalities. Some poor countries, \r\nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are not likely to \r\nachieve the MDGs by 2015. Official development \r\nassistance has also declined, despite pledges to the \r\ncontrary, and developments at the Doha negotiations so \r\nfar provide little comfort for developing countries. \r\n Permit me now to share with representatives the \r\noutcome of the Second African Ministerial Conference \r\non Financing for Development, held in Accra. \r\n In May 2007, the Government of Ghana hosted \r\nthe Second African Ministerial Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development. The theme of the Accra \r\nconference was “Infrastructure for Growth — the \r\nEnergy Challenge”. The main focus of the Conference \r\nwas the energy sector — particularly its financing and \r\nits contribution to the growth agenda for meeting the \r\nMDGs by 2015.  \r\n The outcome of the discussions comprised \r\n15 concrete action points for Governments, \r\ninternational partners and the private sector, aimed at \r\naddressing the dual challenge of increasing access to \r\nenergy for the poor and ensuring the reliable \r\nfunctioning of existing energy infrastructure. Those \r\npoints include the following. Governments must \r\nstrengthen planning frameworks to take into account \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 4 \r\n \r\nand accelerate the pace of current regional initiatives \r\nsuch as the Inga Dam project in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, regional power pools and gas \r\npipeline projects. International partners must deliver on \r\npast promises and pledges for development assistance, \r\nand then scale up aid to the energy sector and develop \r\nnew funding instruments and mechanisms for \r\ntransboundary energy projects. The private sector must, \r\nthrough financial institutions, develop new financing \r\ninstruments such as infrastructure bonds. It is \r\nimportant that the action points be implemented by all \r\nstakeholders in order to advance the development of \r\nthe continent. \r\n One sure way in which African countries can \r\nfinance our development is through fair international \r\ntrade. It is therefore imperative that all well-meaning \r\ncountries make the adjustments necessary to make it \r\npossible for the current trade talks to be concluded. \r\n Our countries have realized that most of the aid \r\nthat we receive — be it in the form of loans or grants — \r\nis supposed to be tax-exempt. Those exemptions have \r\nassumed proportions that have made them unsustainable. \r\nIn fact, in Ghana they amounted to 3 per cent of our \r\ngross domestic product in 2006. There is a need for \r\ndevelopment partners to review the tax exemption \r\npolicies incorporated into their aid programmes.  \r\n We need to take a long-term view of financing \r\nprogrammes, as Ghana has done with regard to its 2057 \r\nbudget, which takes into account what could happen \r\nover a period of 20 to 50 years. \r\n The increasing significance of emerging donors, \r\nsuch as China and India, in recipient countries means \r\nthat they are increasingly involved in the development \r\ndialogue and in decision-making. Their further \r\ninvolvement would enhance the quality of that \r\ndialogue and would contribute to aid harmonization.  \r\n We are interested in the carbon credit \r\nmechanisms, which would help us to know what is \r\nreally going on. We are also very happy to point out the \r\nneed to front-load aid to enable recipient countries to \r\nembark on their projects and programmes in a timely \r\nmanner. We are aiming to achieve the One Laptop Per \r\nChild project, designed to bridge the gap between \r\ndeveloped countries and developing countries. Ghana \r\nis seeking to assemble approximately 5 million \r\npersonal computers in order to make sure that its \r\nschoolchildren have access to them. I hope that we will \r\nbe supported in that effort.  \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency The \r\nHonourable Samuel Mumbengegwi, Minister of \r\nFinance of Zimbabwe. \r\n Mr. Mumbengegwi (Zimbabwe): It is a pleasure \r\nfor me to be here today to share ideas on the important \r\nsubject of financing for development. My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus of 2002 launched a \r\nnew partnership for financing for development, \r\nespecially the internationally agreed goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\ndiscourse we are having today provides an opportunity \r\nfor us to assess progress made, recognize obstacles and \r\nconstraints and identify new challenges, opportunities \r\nand emerging issues of concern, particularly to \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n The primary responsibility for national \r\ndevelopment is vested in national Governments. \r\nZimbabwe, like other developing countries, is making \r\nevery effort to achieve the MDGs by 2015 and to \r\ninvest in the crucial areas of agriculture, infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, health and education. The MDGs have \r\nprovided us with a framework for putting poverty \r\nreduction and human well-being at the centre of our \r\ndevelopment efforts, and we have made great strides in \r\neducation and health. \r\n However, rising poverty levels remain a \r\nchallenge for Zimbabwe, undermining the achievement \r\nof the MDGs. Recurrent droughts, the illegal sanctions \r\nimposed on our country by some powerful countries \r\nand the HIV/AIDS pandemic continue to slow down \r\neconomic growth in the country. Despite those \r\nchallenges, the Government has continued to \r\nimplement turnaround strategies aimed at steering the \r\neconomy towards sustained economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n It is now widely accepted that, without a \r\ncomplementary international effort to finance \r\ndevelopment in developing countries, the objective of \r\nachieving the internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the MDGs, will remain elusive. It was that \r\nrealization that led Governments and multilateral trade \r\nand financial institutions, under the aegis of the United \r\nNations, to commit themselves at Monterrey in 2002 to \r\nprovide more resources to finance development. The \r\n2005 World Summit reaffirmed the need to take \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n5 07-55833 \r\n \r\nconcrete action to accelerate development. The \r\nimmediate objective of the commitments made there \r\nwas to reduce poverty, particularly extreme poverty. \r\n Monterrey was able to make the correct diagnosis \r\nand identify the constraints that developing countries \r\nface in their efforts to eradicate poverty through \r\neconomic and social development. Five years after \r\nMonterrey, the remedies that the international \r\ncommunity agreed to undertake have not been fully \r\nimplemented, thereby preventing the achievement of \r\ntargets that were set.  \r\n It is now apparent that the current official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) levels fall short of \r\nrequirements for meeting the targets associated with \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. In this \r\nregard, developed countries need to fulfil their \r\npromises to meet the target of providing 0.7 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national income as official development \r\nassistance to developing countries in the short term. \r\nSuch assistance needs to be adequate, predictable and \r\ncontinuous in order to have a meaningful impact. In the \r\nlong term, new and additional resources are required to \r\nenable developing countries to continue to fight \r\npoverty beyond the MDG target date of 2015. \r\n While we commend those countries that have met \r\nand even surpassed the target of 0.7 per cent of their \r\ngross national income, we urge those that have not yet \r\ndone so to continue scaling up aid in order to reach the \r\nrequired level. On the other hand, it is important to \r\nanalyze the volume of aid and its effectiveness on the \r\nground. Aid earmarked for specific programmes, most \r\nof which are not developmental in nature, very often \r\nfails to have the desired impact. \r\n Concerted efforts must also be directed towards \r\naddressing the problem of the unsustainable external \r\ndebt faced by a number of developing countries. While \r\nwe recognize the various initiatives that have been \r\nundertaken to reduce the debt burden of a number of \r\ndeveloping countries, including the Multilateral Debt \r\nRelief Initiative, we are, however, of the view that the \r\nprocess is slow and does not cover all countries. We \r\nare also of the view that the real solution to the \r\ndeveloping countries debt problem would be full debt \r\ncancellation. Additionally, the inclusion of debt relief \r\nin aid statistics can be very misleading. The simple fact \r\nis that debt relief does not make new resources \r\navailable for development. \r\n Since development is a process and not an event, \r\nwe believe that more attention should be paid to \r\naddressing the disparities in the global trade regime so \r\nas to remove trade barriers. If we act now to remove \r\ntrade barriers, agricultural subsidies and restrictive \r\nrules on intellectual property rights, we will be laying a \r\nsolid foundation for sustainable development that can \r\nlead to the eradication of poverty, particularly the \r\nextreme poverty that engulfs millions of people.  \r\n The reform of international financial institutions \r\nto make them more democratic by allowing developing \r\ncountries a greater voice and participation in decision-\r\nmaking processes is an issue that remains unresolved. \r\nThe level of participation of developing countries in \r\ndecision-making within these institutions does not \r\nreflect the numerical strength and influence of \r\ndeveloping countries in the global system. It is \r\nregrettable that the repeated calls to reform these \r\ninstitutions, including addressing the issue of \r\ndistribution of voting rights at the International \r\nMonetary Fund (IMF), continues to fall on deaf ears.  \r\n Zimbabwe is of the view that all aid to \r\ndeveloping countries should be unconditional and \r\ntailor-made to support the development priorities of the \r\nrecipient country. In addition, Zimbabwe rejects the \r\nuse of coercive economic measures as a tool to ensure \r\npolitical compliance with the whims of those countries \r\nthat perceive themselves to be powerful. Such \r\nmalicious actions undermine development cooperation \r\nand should not be entertained by the international \r\ncommunity as it works to increase development and \r\nreverse poverty. \r\n Zimbabwe would like to express its confidence in \r\nthe ability of the United Nations system to coordinate \r\nand lead the development efforts of the international \r\ncommunity, including through its agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes. However, these operational activities for \r\ndevelopment of the United Nations system must earn \r\nthe confidence of all by maintaining their neutrality \r\nand supporting the development policies, priorities, \r\nand strategies of Member States. They must also resist \r\nthe temptation to further donors’ ulterior motives in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating that together we \r\nhave agreed that mobilizing financial resources for \r\ndevelopment is central to a successful global \r\npartnership for development. This High-level Dialogue \r\nwould therefore be of great value, if it were to infuse \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 6 \r\n \r\nurgency to the fulfilment of commitments on financing \r\nfor development made at Monterrey and the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, including the establishment of effective \r\nmechanisms to measure aid inflows. We must therefore \r\nmuster the necessary political will to tackle head on the \r\nobstacles encountered since Monterrey, with a view to \r\ncompletely removing them, in order to guarantee the \r\nsuccess of the follow-up conference to be held in Doha, \r\nQatar next year. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency, Mr. Igor Lukšić, Minister of Finance of \r\nMontenegro. \r\n Mr. Lukšić (Montenegro): It is my particular \r\npleasure to address this High-level Dialogue on \r\nFinancing for Development at this important moment \r\nfor the follow-up to the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and ahead of the Doha \r\nconference in 2008. At the outset, I would like to point \r\nout that Montenegro has fully aligned itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Portugal on \r\nbehalf of the European Union presidency. Therefore, \r\nI will take the opportunity to make a statement in my \r\nnational capacity by emphasizing a few issues that are \r\nof particular importance for Montenegro. \r\n The overall advancement toward the achievement \r\nof the internationally agreed Millennium Development \r\nGoals in Montenegro has been very positive as it \r\nevolves alongside the European Union integration \r\nprocesses. Montenegro signed the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Agreement on 15 October 2007, thus \r\nopening a new chapter not only with regard to the \r\npolitical, but also the economic, market, and fiscal \r\nareas of development. This framework will enable us to \r\npromote sustainable development and carry out poverty \r\nreduction strategies. \r\n In recent years, Montenegro has achieved \r\nmacroeconomic stability, and the prospect of growth \r\nremains strong. Real gross national income growth for \r\nthe past three years is expected to be an average of \r\nseven per cent. Inflation is low at between two and \r\nthree per cent. There has been a budgetary surplus in \r\nthe past two years of about four per cent, and the level \r\nof public debt is moderate at 35 per cent. We have \r\nchampioned the foreign direct investment (FDI) \r\ninflows in our region in the past two years. FDI is an \r\nimportant vehicle for the transfer of knowledge, skills \r\nand technology, and for the reduction of poverty, as \r\nnoted in the Secretary-General’s report. Montenegro \r\nhas recognized that the challenge for developing \r\ncountries is to increase trade and attract FDI in a way \r\nthat will maximize its contribution to long-term \r\ndevelopment and has carried out a comprehensive set \r\nof activities to ensure the sustainability of economic \r\ngrowth.  \r\n As stated in the World Summit Outcome \r\ndocument, our development is our responsibility. \r\nCreating a friendly business environment for domestic \r\nand international investments is of utmost importance. \r\nA stable macroeconomic environment, market-friendly \r\nframeworks, availability of human resources, and a \r\nmeasure of predictability are recognized as crucial to \r\nthe effective implementation of my country’s \r\ndevelopment strategies as well as for fostering public-\r\nprivate partnerships, improved transparency, and \r\naccountability. Montenegro recognizes that it has the \r\nprimary responsibility to develop adequate \r\nadministrative capacities, to design and implement \r\ndevelopment strategies and to set priorities and \r\ntimelines for their implementation. \r\n Being a small Mediterranean country in the last \r\nstage of transition, we understand that infrastructural \r\nbottlenecks pose the greatest challenge to stimulating \r\ngrowth and development. Investors know how to \r\nallocate resources, but it is up to the Government to \r\ncommit energy to motivate their decisions on the basis \r\nof a solid infrastructure. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to stress the \r\nparticular relevance of international financial \r\ninstitutions and their technical support. As a small \r\nmiddle-income country, Montenegro maintains good \r\nrelations with our international financial institution \r\npartners. We therefore welcome the latest decision of \r\nthe World Bank to cut interest rates. At the same time, \r\nwe call for the allocation of the net income of \r\ninternational financial institutions be directed towards \r\nmore technical support for countries, in order to \r\ntransfer know-how, and address social inequality and \r\nglobal climate change and to help them to prepare \r\ninfrastructure projects. \r\n To that end, Montenegro commends activities that \r\nfoster international financial and technical cooperation. \r\nWe also welcome ongoing efforts at the global level to \r\nreach the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome for official development assistance (ODA) by \r\n2015 and to improve the quality, predictability and \r\neffectiveness of ODA. \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n7 07-55833 \r\n \r\n I believe deeply that this important momentum \r\ntowards global development will not be lost and that \r\nseveral different initiatives will foster the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand other internationally agreed development goals. \r\nMontenegro also supports an outcome document in the \r\nstyle of a ministerial declaration that would focus on \r\nthe further implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Tijjani Yahaya Kaura, Minister of State \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Nigeria.  \r\n Mr. Kaura (Nigeria): Let me start, Sir, by joining \r\nother speakers in commending your laudable initiative \r\nto convene this very important High-level Dialogue on \r\nFinancing for Development.  \r\n While my delegation associates itself fully with \r\nthe statement made this morning by the Minister of \r\nState for Economic Affairs of Pakistan on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, I wish to reflect on some \r\nissues from Nigeria’s national perspective. \r\n The most pressing preoccupation of the world \r\ncommunity today is how to assist developing countries \r\nto achieve internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nin a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. \r\nThis High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment is therefore inevitably anchored on that \r\npremise.  \r\n We thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report (A/62/217) and the useful \r\nrecommendations contained therein. We are worried \r\nabout the disturbing trend referred to in the report, \r\nnamely, that in spite of the general improvement in the \r\nworld economy there are widespread concerns that the \r\nfruits of development and growth are not fairly \r\ndistributed and that, even more disturbing, there seems \r\nto be a growing trend towards a higher concentration of \r\nincome and wealth in a few countries. \r\n This is a wake-up call for the international \r\ncommunity to assist developing countries to take \r\nappropriate measures to diversify their economies and \r\nmobilize domestic, external and other forms of \r\nfinancing to ensure sustainable growth and \r\ndevelopment. However, the efforts of developing \r\ncountries will yield the desired results only if they are \r\nbacked by a massive infusion of foreign direct \r\ninvestment, fair and equitable trade, access to the \r\nmarkets of industrialized countries, decreased subsidies \r\nfor agriculture by industrialized countries, debt relief \r\nand sustainability and improved official development \r\nassistance (ODA) — all of which must be tailored to \r\nthe development aspirations of recipient countries. \r\n In spite of the daunting challenges facing \r\ndeveloping countries, Nigeria’s economic reforms, as \r\nencapsulated in both its first and second national \r\neconomic empowerment and development strategies, \r\nhave recorded modest progress in kick-starting the \r\neconomy and addressing many of its structural defects. \r\nIn that respect, our strong macroeconomic performance \r\nhas continued to attract commendation from our \r\ndevelopment partners, with some analysts even \r\nprojecting that if the trend continues Nigeria could join \r\nthe 20 largest world economies by the year 2020. The \r\nGovernment is therefore determined to achieve that.  \r\n The statistics are quite encouraging. For instance, \r\nfrom 2002 to 2006 annual gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) grew at an average of 6 per cent, with inflation \r\nsteadily declining to single-digit levels, and external \r\nreserves steadily increased to the current level of \r\n$47 billion. Furthermore, foreign direct investment \r\nflows into the country increased steadily, from about \r\n$1 billion in 1999 to about $4.5 billion in 2006. \r\n Interestingly, however, that growth has been \r\ndriven not just by the oil sector but also, to a lesser \r\nextent, by the non-oil sectors of agriculture, \r\nmanufacturing, telecommunications, banking and \r\nfinance and wholesale and retail trade. To further \r\ndiversify the economy, the Government is planning to \r\nembark on massive investment in petrochemical plants \r\nand the development of enterprise centres and \r\nindustrial clusters around the country. Nigeria has also \r\nsucceeded in drastically reducing its external debt, \r\nfrom about $35.9 billion in 2005 to about \r\n$3,348,000,000 early this year. In fact, the Government \r\ntook a deliberate decision to dedicate all proceeds from \r\nthe Paris Club debt deal to scale up pro-poor \r\nprogrammes and projects. \r\n In spite of those appreciable strides, for Nigeria \r\nto consolidate and build a solid economic base it will \r\nhave to confront and surmount its acute infrastructural \r\ndeficiencies — especially in the areas of power, water, \r\nrailways and roads — which are threatening our \r\nsustained drive towards economic growth and \r\nindustrialization. The Government has therefore \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 8 \r\n \r\nembarked upon extensive sectoral reforms of its \r\ninfrastructure and the establishment of legal, regulatory \r\nand administrative frameworks conducive to foreign \r\ninvestment. We would welcome massive foreign \r\ninvestment to fund infrastructure development. It is \r\nestimated that Nigeria will require between $6 billion \r\nand $9 billion annually to fix the facilities it needs to \r\nmaintain sustained economic growth.  \r\n In order to mobilize domestic resources for \r\ndevelopment, the Government has perfected an \r\neffective public-private partnership in line with the \r\nassertion contained in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that a robust domestic private sector that is \r\nitself investing in its economy will provide a powerful \r\nsignal to attract productive private investment inflows.  \r\n We also believe that for economic growth to be \r\nmeaningful and sustainable, it has to improve the living \r\nconditions of the people. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus emphasized the \r\nlinkage between trade, development and finance. Most \r\ndeveloping countries, including African countries, \r\ntherefore, view greater access to the markets of \r\ndeveloped countries and institutional capacity building \r\nto ensure that as the best way to ensure sustainable \r\neconomic growth that is development-oriented rather \r\nthan dependant upon aid.  \r\n Nevertheless, in order to better attune ODA to \r\nNigeria’s development strategies, the Government has \r\ndeveloped an official development assistance policy to \r\navoid a situation where a substantial part of a grant is \r\nused to pay experts from donor countries.  \r\n On the road to Doha, we view the World Trade \r\nOrganization negotiating areas of agriculture, \r\nnon-agricultural market access and services as very \r\nimportant. Hence, we are prepared to engage in the \r\nongoing negotiations in a manner that will produce the \r\ngreatest possible benefits for developing countries. \r\n Finally, we note with deep concern that, while the \r\ndeveloping countries are striving, against all odds, to \r\nimplement their part of the commitments by devising \r\nnational development strategies, improving governance \r\nand creating a macroeconomic climate conducive to \r\ngrowth, trade and investment, our development \r\npartners have yet to fulfil all their commitments related \r\nto development assistance and financing, trade, \r\ntechnology transfer and other areas of cooperation.  \r\n My delegation therefore believes that the time is \r\nripe for the international community to take concerted \r\nand time-bound action to ensure the implementation of \r\nall the commitments made by our development \r\npartners. We hope that the current institutional reforms \r\nin the Bretton Woods institutions will go far enough to \r\nensure greater voting rights and representation for \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries, in \r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Sangaré Maimouna Bah, Minister of \r\nHealth of Guinea. \r\n Ms. Bah (Guinea) (spoke in French): Permit me \r\nto tell you, Mr. President, how happy we are to see you \r\nleading our work. I should also like to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General and the Secretariat on the quality of \r\nthe documents submitted and on the clarity with which \r\nthe issues before us are being considered. My \r\ndelegation fully agrees with the assessments made and \r\nthe action proposals put forward.  \r\n The Republic of Guinea, which is classified \r\namong the least developed countries and which faces \r\ndrastic economic reforms, remains largely dependent \r\non foreign aid for the financing of its development. \r\nSometimes, up to 80 per cent of our public investment \r\nis financed by such aid. We are thus very interested in \r\ninnovative financing methods and aid effectiveness as \r\nareas for greater mobilization and rational use of \r\ndevelopment assistance resources.  \r\n To that end, after joining the International Drug \r\nPurchase Facility, the Guinean Government plans to do \r\nthe following. At Conakry in the first quarter of 2008, \r\nwe will hold a national forum on innovative financing \r\nmechanisms and non-governmental cooperation, at \r\nwhich national and external actors can share experiences \r\nand coordinate activities. At Conakry, we will also host \r\nthe fifth plenary meeting of the Pilot Group on \r\nSolidarity Contributions for Development. After that, at \r\nthe Doha Conference planned for December 2008, \r\nGuinea will present a common platform, on behalf of the \r\nPilot Group and Africa, on innovative ways to finance \r\nofficial development assistance. With a view to carrying \r\nout those activities, the Government requests support \r\nfrom its development partners.  \r\n From this rostrum, the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea would like to reaffirm its support \r\nfor the objectives of innovative financing and for the \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n9 07-55833 \r\n \r\nimplementation mechanisms recommended by the Pilot \r\nGroup. My delegation welcomes the consensus reached \r\nin Seoul at the Pilot Group’s third meeting, held on \r\n3 and 4 September 2007. It grants Africa the privilege \r\nof holding two successive Pilot Group meetings, to be \r\nheld at Dakar in March 2008 and at Conakry in \r\nOctober 2008. The Republic of Guinea will collaborate \r\nwith the Senegalese presidency, the members of the \r\nPilot Group, international organizations, civil society, \r\nthe diasporas and the business community in preparing \r\nfor the participation of the Pilot Group and Africa in \r\nthe Follow-up International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, scheduled for December 2008, \r\nsix years after the adoption of the Consensus. The \r\nConference will mark a decisive turning point in the \r\ninternational community’s commitment to ensuring the \r\nfinancing necessary for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015.  \r\n My country urges Member States to join the Pilot \r\nGroup and to participate in those activities. I also take \r\nthis opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the Group for \r\nthe dynamism and effectiveness that it has displayed \r\nsince its establishment. \r\n For the Republic of Guinea, development \r\nfinancing and aid effectiveness mean the following: \r\ncancel the debt of the poorest countries; mobilize \r\nsignificant financial and technical resources in the \r\nform of subsidies and concessionary loans to build \r\nphysical infrastructure, provide sufficient support to \r\ngrowth sectors, strengthen institutions and promote \r\nhuman resources; develop complementarity in the \r\nsubregional environment and promote regional \r\neconomic integration, while fostering the ideals of \r\npeace, security and stability, which are prerequisites \r\nfor development; create new forms of partnership, \r\nbetter suited to the options of liberalization between \r\npublic and private actors, bringing together \r\ncommunities, civil society and non-governmental \r\norganizations; combat corruption and improve \r\ngood-governance practices; and establish a fruitful \r\nlong-term dialogue between Guinea and its \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\n Finally, my delegation reaffirms its full support \r\nfor, and its entire willingness to cooperate in, the \r\nprocess now under way. We are convinced that that \r\nsupport is justified by what is at stake. Development \r\nfinancing should be made universal, given the immense \r\npossibilities that it offers to the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Patricia Orantes, Planning and \r\nProgramming Secretary of the Presidency, Guatemala. \r\n Mrs. Orantes (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nGuatemala is grateful for the convening of this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue, which is an essential mechanism \r\nfor following up on the Monterrey Consensus and \r\npreparing for the intergovernmental Conference to be \r\nheld at Doha. We reaffirm our commitment to making \r\nthe best use of the most cost-effective mechanisms for \r\nfollowing up on the Consensus, including the Annual \r\nMinisterial Review and the Development Cooperation \r\nForum, recently established within the Economic and \r\nSocial Council.  \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, the Rio Group and the Pilot Group on Solidarity \r\nContributions for Development. We would like to make \r\na few additional comments from a national perspective.  \r\n We wish to take this opportunity to emphasize \r\nthat Guatemala considers the Monterrey Conference to \r\nhave been among the most successful gatherings in \r\nUnited Nations history in the area of development for \r\nall. It raised awareness throughout the world about the \r\ncritical role of international cooperation as a \r\ncomplement to national efforts, and that has had an \r\nimpact. Thanks to the Monterrey Conference, the \r\ntrends in areas such as official development assistance, \r\ndebt relief and access to private capital markets have \r\nbeen reversed. Monterrey also led to better \r\ncoordination between the United Nations and the \r\nBretton Woods institutions, which we welcome. The \r\ngreat unresolved task, as we are aware, is the Doha \r\nRound.  \r\n We also wish to reaffirm that Guatemala attaches \r\nimportance to the participation of civil society and the \r\nprivate sector in the regular follow-up to the \r\nConference carried out at the hearings held with \r\nrepresentatives of those groups on 11 and 22 October. \r\nThose mechanisms, if well-managed, have the potential \r\nto strengthen the legitimacy and effectiveness of this \r\nkind of dialogue.  \r\n Guatemala has entered its second decade \r\nfollowing the signing of the Peace Agreements. The \r\nperiod has been characterized by a strengthening of the \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 10 \r\n \r\nexecutive branch’s leadership in aligning international \r\ncooperation with public policies, guided by the \r\nprinciples of shared responsibilities and mutual \r\naccountability. We have also seen an improvement in \r\nmutual confidence based on transparency and the \r\nachievement of results through successful national \r\nmechanisms such as the External Cooperation Cabinet \r\nand the group for dialogue between the Government \r\nand the international community. The time for \r\ndisorganized international cooperation and unilateral \r\nconditionality’s is behind us.  \r\n Allow me, on behalf of the Guatemalan people \r\nand its Government, to express our thanks for the \r\ncentral role played by foreign assistance, both political \r\nand financial, in bringing about peace and enabling the \r\nimplementation of the commitments made by the State, \r\nthrough the mobilization of approximately $3.4 billion \r\nover the past decade. \r\n Today our Peace Agreements have become a \r\nlegacy promoting South-South cooperation among \r\ndeveloping countries. They have without question \r\nconstituted a turning point in our mobilization of \r\ninternal and external financial resources. Work is still \r\npending on a fiscal pact on important areas such as \r\nequity in the distribution of the tax burden. Today \r\nGuatemala is the Central American country that \r\nallocates the highest percentage of its budget to social \r\ninvestments, and, in a period of 11 years, has doubled \r\nthe percentage of its gross domestic product destined to \r\nsocial policies.  \r\n That national effort means that today we can \r\nexpect to achieve the majority, if not all, of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. That will be possible \r\nif, and only if, we permanently strengthen and maintain \r\ncontinuity in our policies, our democratic institutions, \r\ndemocratic security in the Central American region and \r\nthe growing presence of Central American countries, \r\nthrough their voice and vote, in international decisions \r\nthat affect us. \r\n The strengthening of the Government’s leading \r\nrole vis-à-vis international cooperation and other \r\nactors, the development of State policies and the slow \r\nbut sustained development of our democratic \r\ninstitutions have made it possible to solidify our \r\nmacroeconomic indicators and attain higher rates of \r\ngrowth in competitiveness and country-risk indicators \r\nand in foreign direct investment. As a result, we have \r\nachieved our highest rates of economic growth and \r\nexports in 20 years. \r\n Nevertheless, Guatemala now faces the challenge \r\nof translating those successful midterm indicators into \r\nbetter distribution patterns and into an aggressive and \r\nsustained reduction of poverty, inequality and social \r\nmarginalization. At the same time, those achievements \r\nreflect the importance for middle-income countries of \r\nsetting clear national rules, in order to advance \r\nsubstantively towards our goals. \r\n In that context, international trade has a central \r\nrole to play for countries like Guatemala, linking the \r\nmost dynamic global markets to the increased \r\ncompetitiveness of our export products, particularly \r\nproducts from rural economies. In the case of \r\nGuatemala, that includes the majority of our \r\npopulation, which is indigenous and has historically \r\nbeen marginalized.  \r\n The complexity of the international negotiations \r\ncarried out within the context of the World Trade \r\nOrganization, in which the interests of developed \r\ncountries have been advanced and the crucial interests \r\nof developing countries have not, have led us to \r\nintensify negotiations on free trade agreements, \r\nbilaterally and with groups of like-minded countries. \r\nThat has yielded mixed results for developing \r\ncountries, pitting the rules of the multilateral World \r\nTrade Organization system against the preferential \r\nsystem of free-trade agreements and creating a \r\ncomplex web of agreements, each with its own \r\nadministrative machinery, which overwhelms the \r\ncapacities of our countries to negotiate and implement \r\nagreements. \r\n The entry into force of innovative mechanisms \r\nfor international cooperation also has a central role in \r\nadvancing the ongoing development agendas of \r\ncountries like Guatemala. In that regard, we wish to \r\nhighlight and express our thanks for the leadership and \r\nthe vision of the United Nations system, through the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, and of the Government \r\nof Spain, whose strategic alliance has allowed us to \r\nframe the question of the so-called middle-income \r\ncountries in relation to international cooperation. This \r\nnew space and agenda for international dialogue \r\nstrengthens us on the political level and allows us to \r\nre-energize the international debate on financing for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n11 07-55833 \r\n \r\n During the preparatory process leading to the \r\nMonterrey Conference, Guatemala participated actively \r\nand in a constructive manner as a member of the \r\nbureau of the Preparatory Committee. On our way to \r\nDoha, we wish to contribute once again, and on this \r\noccasion we offer Guatemala as the host of the regional \r\nconsultations that will contribute the vision of the \r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States to the \r\n2008 Doha Conference. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Samuel R. Insanally, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Guyana and former President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Insanally (Guyana): Coming as it does in the \r\nimmediate aftermath of the International Monetary \r\nFund and World Bank meeting in Washington, D.C., \r\nthis High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment offers us another welcome opportunity to \r\nrevisit the Monterrey Consensus and to see how it has \r\nbeen implemented thus far and what more needs to be \r\ndone to ensure further progress. \r\n Certainly, Monterrey was an important milestone \r\nin the search for greater and more predictable financing \r\nto satisfy the needs of global development. However, \r\nfrom all indications, the record of accomplishments \r\nsince Monterrey is a mixed one. Recent reports point to \r\nsome improvement in per capita income in various \r\nparts of the world. However, the apparently growing \r\ntrend towards a higher concentration of income and \r\nwealth may yet signal increasing global inequalities \r\nand the further marginalization of the poor.  \r\n Given these challenges, the continued failure of \r\ndonor countries to honour the commitments they made \r\nat Monterrey and other major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits, as well as in the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness, risks jeopardizing \r\nthe international development agenda. It is imperative \r\nthat the recent reduction in official development \r\nassistance (ODA) be reversed and that levels be raised \r\nurgently to meet the established, internationally agreed \r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. ODA \r\nflows also need be directed to key priority areas that \r\nwill optimize their development impact. \r\n One such area is the promotion of investment in \r\nagriculture and rural development. Such investment is \r\ncritical to ensure food security, especially in this new \r\nage of biofuel production. Without it, global efforts to \r\nreduce poverty and hunger by 2015 will be severely \r\nundermined.  \r\n Guyana welcomes the recently published World \r\nDevelopment Report 2008, which calls attention to the \r\nimportance of agriculture in the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \r\npromotion of sustainable development. As the report \r\nobserves, while 75 per cent of the world’s poor live in \r\nrural areas in developing countries, a mere 4 per cent \r\nof official development assistance (ODA) goes to \r\nagriculture. It further notes that growth in gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) originating in agriculture is \r\nabout four times more effective in raising the incomes \r\nof extremely poor people than GDP growth originating \r\noutside the sector. A key goal of future efforts in \r\nfinancing for development should therefore be to \r\nincrease the levels of investment in the promotion of \r\nagricultural development and food security. \r\n Earlier this month, Guyana was honoured to host \r\nthe Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting. From \r\ndiscussions at the Meeting emerged the recognition \r\nthat the effects of global warming and climate change \r\nhave serious negative implications for the growth and \r\ndevelopment of small States and for other \r\nenvironmentally vulnerable developing economies. \r\nFrom this rostrum, I reiterate the call made by \r\nCommonwealth finance ministers for global efforts to \r\nmobilize financial resources to support those countries \r\nthrough common frameworks. \r\n To ensure sustainable development, increased \r\nresource flows must go hand in hand with greater \r\ncoherence in global economic, trade and environment \r\npolicies. The effects of the lack of coherence are all too \r\nevident for small countries such as my own, and others \r\nin the Caribbean that have recently witnessed the \r\nprecipitous dismantlement of preferential sugar and \r\ntrade regimes without adequate transitional \r\narrangements. Significant new and additional resources \r\nwill be needed to modernize our productive sectors so \r\nthat our countries can compete in the global economy. \r\n As we look forward to next year’s Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, which is to be held in Doha, we \r\nare reminded that the development promise of the \r\nDoha Round of trade negotiations has yet to be \r\nfulfilled. This new road to Doha offers us all another \r\nchance to ensure that mechanisms are put in place to \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 12 \r\n \r\ndeliver on the pledge to place development at the \r\ncentre of the international trade agenda. The special \r\nchallenges of small States must be fully addressed \r\nwithin that framework. \r\n Let me end by recalling a most important \r\nquestion that, as I recall, was posed at Monterrey. That \r\nquestion is, How do we ensure that the commitments \r\nmade by our development partners are effectively \r\nhonoured? The question, I believe, remains as relevant \r\ntoday as it was then; for, as experience has shown, \r\nmany in the international community are very long on \r\npromises but short on delivery. The lesson we must \r\nlearn is that, in as much as recipient countries are \r\nsubject to conditionality’s for financing, so too must \r\ndonor countries be accountable for the fulfilment of \r\npromises made. It is time that a monitoring mechanism \r\nbe introduced to assess the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and to ensure that it is kept \r\nfirmly on track. We simply cannot afford to let the \r\nConsensus wither and die. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Maguy Durcé, Minister of Trade and \r\nIndustry of Haiti. \r\n Ms. Durcé (Haiti) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the Government and the people of Haiti, the \r\ndelegation that I have the honour to head in my \r\ncapacity as Minister of Trade and Industry would like \r\nvery warmly to congratulate you, Mr. President, on \r\nhaving convened this international High-level Dialogue \r\non Financing for Development. I would also very \r\nsincerely like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport (A/62/217). The information contained in the \r\nreport will guide and inspire our upcoming \r\ndeliberations as we seek to identify ways that will \r\nhopefully allow us to permanently reverse the current \r\nunfavourable trend between now and the Doha meeting \r\nand beyond. \r\n This High-level Dialogue is taking place at a very \r\nopportune time. I am certain that the relevant \r\ndiscussions and exchanges that will take place here \r\nwill lead us towards appropriate avenues to evaluate \r\nfinancing for development when we review the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus at Doha, \r\nQatar, in 2008.  \r\n In that regard, Haiti associates itself with the \r\nstatement made this morning by the representative of \r\nPakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The Republic of Haiti is more committed than \r\never to the process under way aimed at achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were \r\nagreed by world leaders in 2000. Nevertheless, as a \r\nleast developed country, our people suffer terribly from \r\nthe current competitive economic environment. \r\nLikewise, major current international imbalances \r\nexclude our countries from the opportunities produced \r\nby globalization, foreclosing any possibility of short-\r\nterm prosperity.  \r\n We would like to affirm that any effort to increase \r\nproductivity also requires active solidarity conducive \r\nto security and social harmony in the most vulnerable \r\ncountries. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to \r\nidentify an appropriate formula than can reduce the \r\ninequalities resulting from a low level of individual \r\ndevelopment in communities mired by all sorts of \r\nhardships. That is an essential step to launching a \r\ncomprehensive approach to economic and business \r\nrelations through the adoption of innovative \r\npartnership agreements.  \r\n The presence and full participation at this \r\nmeeting of high-level representatives from the \r\ninternational financial institutions makes this gathering \r\nthe ideal framework to consider the steps so eagerly \r\nawaited by all the citizens of the world, whom we all \r\nhave a responsibility to protect and serve through \r\npublic policies that generate hopes for sustainable \r\ndevelopment guided by an approach which allows for \r\nincreasingly greater access to basic goods and social \r\nservices, so as to preserve the dignity of men and \r\nwomen without distinction or discrimination.  \r\n I therefore heartily appeal to the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions and, more generally, to all our development \r\npartners to give all due attention to the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, which evaluates the shortcomings \r\nwith regard to the commitments undertaken in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. The report notes the difference \r\nthat exists among the members of the Development \r\nAssistance Committee when it comes to the pledge to \r\nincrease assistance made at Monterrey in 2000. \r\nAlthough some have honoured their commitments, \r\nothers have not. The result is that official development \r\nassistance (ODA) dropped by 5.1 per cent in 2006. The \r\ncommitment to devote 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome (GNI) to ODA that Committee members agreed \r\nto — with 0.2 per cent of that going to least developed \r\ncountries — is far from being achieved. All of these \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n13 07-55833 \r\n \r\nefforts and all of our energies have to be oriented \r\ntowards the mobilization of all possible sources of \r\nfinancing in order to rise to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment challenge in the twenty-first century, for \r\nour own benefit and for emerging and future \r\ngenerations. \r\n My delegation extends its firm support for the \r\nDeclaration on innovative sources of financing for \r\ndevelopment, which was issued by the Pilot Group on \r\nSolidarity Contributions for Development, for which \r\nFrance has the permanent secretariat and which is \r\nchaired by Senegal. My country also welcomes the \r\nother sponsors of the initiative, Brazil and Norway, in \r\nparticular, to mention only those two.  \r\n Despite our uncomfortable situation of being the \r\nonly least developed country in the region of the \r\nAmericas and the Caribbean, the Republic of Haiti \r\nnonetheless managed to attain macroeconomic \r\nstabilization. The low level of national savings has not \r\nenabled our population to understand, much less to \r\nappreciate, this remarkable effort undertaken by the \r\nHaitian Government, which is today fighting resolutely \r\nagainst corruption and illicit trafficking in drugs. This \r\nis an expression of the political will displayed by \r\nPresident René Préval and Prime Minister Jacques \r\nÉdouard Alexis at the head of the Government of \r\nOpenness currently in place, in which I have the \r\nhonour of being a part, as a representative of a political \r\ncoalition that was in competition with the President in \r\nthe last elections. That said, it is nevertheless true that \r\nthe current political will and administrative rigour \r\nensure a calm socio-political climate that is favourable \r\nto stability.  \r\n It is also clear that the country, relying only on its \r\nown resources, will find it very difficult to generate \r\ngrowth and to eradicate poverty. The trade and industry \r\nsector in the new fiscal year 2007-2008 has decided to \r\nintensify the promotion of micro-units for production \r\nand service, which are supported by financial credits \r\nextended to them on a priority basis, producing both \r\nfor domestic consumption and for export sale. This \r\nstrategy was selected in response to political and \r\ninstitutional trends, at both the national and regional \r\nlevels, with regard to the expansion of small units of \r\nproduction. The final result expected is the broadening \r\nof the tax base. In addition, the Government has started \r\nrehabilitating the road system, and a centre for \r\nfacilitating investment has been established. The \r\ninvestment code has been revised in order to attract \r\ndirect investment. Public-private partnership has been \r\ninstitutionalized. All of this shows that Haiti is on the \r\nright track towards its goal of economic development. \r\n We think that international trade can be the \r\ndriving force for sustainable development. We \r\ntherefore expect that the multilateral negotiations of \r\nthe Doha Round and trade assistance activities will \r\nprovide a real regime where our products will have \r\naccess to external markets, free of tariffs and lead to \r\nthe elimination of certain barriers and trade practices \r\nthat are detrimental to trade. Today, assigning blame or \r\ndenouncing practices are not the best method. Rich and \r\npoor, we all have the responsibility to create the \r\nconditions for the betterment of all in peace and \r\nsecurity. We want to do this, we have to do this, and I \r\nhope that we will be able to do this. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency The Honourable Zhivargo Laing, Minister \r\nof State for Finance of the Bahamas. \r\n Mr. Laing (Bahamas): I extend warm greetings \r\nto this Assembly from the Government and the people \r\nof the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. I commend the \r\nUnited Nations for convening this important meeting, \r\nrepresenting another follow-up to the original meeting \r\nthat gave rise to the consensus agreed by heads of State \r\nand Government in Monterrey, Mexico in 2002. \r\n The Bahamas welcomes the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in this year’s High-level Dialogue. It is our \r\nhope that this meeting will allow us to move beyond \r\ndialogue with its follow-up reports and papers and \r\nmeetings to actually realize the results of the six \r\nleading policy actions adopted by the heads of State at \r\nthat first meeting in Monterrey. Stated plainly, it is our \r\nhope that we actually, first, mobilize domestic financial \r\nresources for development; secondly, mobilize \r\ninternational resources for development; thirdly, \r\nachieve development by using international trade as an \r\nengine; fourthly, increase international and technical \r\nco-operation for development; fifthly, deal with the \r\nexternal debt plight of developing countries; and, \r\nsixthly, address systemic issues, enhancing coherence \r\nand consistency of the international monetary, financial \r\nand trading systems to support development. \r\n If we do these things, the meeting to be held in \r\nDoha in the second half of 2008 will take on new \r\nmeaning, real meaning. If the deliberations here and \r\nduring next year’s Special High-level meeting of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council produce real progress, \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 14 \r\n \r\nwe will enable our heads of State at the review \r\nconference to take critical decisions leading to genuine \r\nprogress in addressing the international economic and \r\nfinancial systemic imbalances that now plague our \r\nworld. \r\n I must note that of the six policy actions \r\nhighlighted at Monterrey, all of which are important, \r\nthe Bahamas identifies most closely with three of \r\nthem: first, mobilizing domestic financial resources; \r\nsecondly, mobilizing international resources, especially \r\nforeign direct investment; and, thirdly, increasing \r\ninternational and technical cooperation for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n The experience of the Bahamas is replete with the \r\nrewards of focusing on these three elements. While we \r\ndo not have wealth-producing natural resources, such \r\nas oil, carbon, gold or diamonds, we do have our \r\npeople. By using domestic finances to invest in the \r\neducation, health and socialization of our people, we \r\nhave been able to establish a comparative advantage in \r\na number of international service sectors. \r\n Similarly, by laying a solid foundation for the \r\nrule of law with its attendant protection of private \r\nproperty rights combined with sound macroeconomic \r\npolicies and a commitment to democratic ideals that \r\nfoster an enduring political stability, we have been able \r\nto mobilize billions of dollars in inward foreign direct \r\ninvestment that has catalyzed our nation’s growth and \r\ndevelopment for more than half a century.  \r\n It is our firm belief that developing countries like \r\nours must continuously focus on these fundamentals in \r\npursuit of their further development. Indeed, we further \r\nbelieve that increased international and technical \r\ncooperation by the international development \r\ninstitutions in pursuit of mobilizing domestic financial \r\nand international resources is the most critical need \r\nthat exists for developing countries already enjoying \r\nsome gains owing to the sustained expansion in the \r\nglobal economy and most especially for those that have \r\nnot been so fortunate. \r\n Over the past fifteen years, we have witnessed a \r\nrestoration and expansion of the Bahamian economy \r\nmade possible by national investments in our economic \r\nand social infrastructure, the improvement of strategic \r\npolicy frameworks and national accounting systems, \r\nand the bolstering of our legislative framework in the \r\nfight against corruption, money laundering and \r\nterrorism. Over the next five years, the Government of \r\nthe Bahamas intends to continue on this path by \r\nintroducing sound policies to increase employment, \r\nentrepreneurship and local ownership in the economy; \r\ncreating balanced economic growth across the \r\narchipelago; increasing investments in our social \r\ninfrastructure, and safeguarding our environment and \r\nheritage for future and present generations. \r\n The Bahamas has also embraced the opportunities \r\npresented by globalization by seeking to participate in \r\nthe international economic, financial and trading \r\nsystems in our efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. However, we continue to face daunting \r\nchallenges posed by our small size and its attendant \r\nvulnerabilities.  \r\n Furthermore, our attempts to build resilience are \r\nconstrained at times by global governance and \r\nsystemic imbalances, which frustrate meaningful \r\nintegration into the global economy. In this regard, the \r\nBahamas reiterates the need for further consideration \r\nof these issues for all developing countries within the \r\nframework of the Monterrey process. \r\n \r\n  Mr. Hannesson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair \r\n \r\n The issue of reform of global economic \r\ngovernance to strengthen the voice and participation of \r\ndeveloping countries in international economic \r\ndecision-making and norm-setting is of critical \r\nimportance to the Bahamas. There is a definite need for \r\nmore concrete, realistic steps to ensure the effective, \r\npermanent representation of developing countries, \r\nparticularly small developing countries, in international \r\neconomic, trade and financial institutions.  \r\n I have only just recently attended the \r\nCommonwealth Ministers of Finance and International \r\nMonetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank meetings. I am \r\npleased to note that in each of these forums there is \r\nconsensus on the need to move in this direction. The \r\nBahamas acknowledges the ongoing efforts to \r\nintroduce balance and equilibrium into the processes \r\nthat govern several international institutions. We \r\nwelcome the 2006 resolution adopted by the IMF \r\nBoard of Governors on Quota and Voice Reform, as \r\nwell as the launching of the World Bank’s process on \r\ngovernance reform, and look forward to continued \r\nwork in that regard. \r\n Ultimately, we seek to elevate the plight of the \r\npeoples of our world. We want to create an \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n15 07-55833 \r\n \r\nenvironment in which children in every village and \r\nhamlet, county and city can realize his or her potential. \r\nFor that to happen, resources, domestic and \r\ninternational, must be mobilized and properly managed \r\nin pursuit of sound development. Far too many of our \r\ncountries struggle to achieve this, whether for historic \r\nreasons or because of the exigencies of prevailing \r\ncircumstances. This much we in the Bahamas believe is \r\ntrue: there exist national and international resources to \r\nchange the situation. It seems now more than ever \r\nbefore that sufficient international resolve exists to \r\nmake this possible. \r\n It is for these reasons that the Bahamas values the \r\nMonterrey process and the mandate to address systemic \r\nissues such as these. In this context and in the absence \r\nof a formal governance structure, we urge a greater role \r\nfor the United Nations in these aspects of global \r\nstandard setting and assessment. The case of the small \r\ndeveloping country must be addressed in the context of \r\na process that is fair, equitable, objective, open and \r\ninclusive. This can only be realized in a forum where \r\nthe rules of international law are observed, and we look \r\nforward to continued dialogue in this regard. \r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Cristina Duarte, Minister of \r\nFinance and Public Administration of Cape Verde. \r\n Mrs. Duarte (Cape Verde): Cape Verde highly \r\nappreciates this opportunity to take part in this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue that marks a turning point towards the \r\ndiminishing time frame for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). I believe that \r\nall of us here are convinced that to achieve the MDGs, \r\nthe donor community must honour and even go beyond \r\nits commitments on trade and debt relief and increase \r\nits official development assistance (ODA). \r\n Despite improvements in the world economy, \r\nwith developing countries generally registering growth \r\nin their per capita gross domestic products, improving \r\ntheir macroeconomic management and contributing to \r\nthe decline of inflation and government deficits, their \r\ninefficient financial sectors, coupled with insufficient \r\ninternational support, remain as core challenges \r\ntowards a strong base of sustainable development. \r\n Despite the trend towards increasing ODA since \r\nthe adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, the level of \r\nODA declined last year. Moreover, the disproportionate \r\ndistribution of ODA, which unfairly concentrates on \r\nparticular regions or countries, raises our concern over \r\nthe resultant unfair distribution of the fruits of \r\ndevelopment and growth. This therefore undermines \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs by some regions. \r\n In Cape Verde, despite its being a small, insular \r\nState lacking natural resources, we firmly believe that \r\ngood governance, better macroeconomic policy and \r\nfiscal management, increased transparency and \r\naccountability of the public sector are fundamental for \r\nemerging from poverty and achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment, together with fair international trade and \r\nfinancial systems and the firm good will of international \r\nstakeholders with respect to their agreed commitments. \r\n Cape Verde is working vigorously to respond to \r\nnational development needs in a more confident and \r\ninnovative manner. Since our independence in 1975, \r\nwe have initiated a campaign against hunger and \r\npoverty and integrated it into our strategic plan for \r\ndevelopment. The challenge, indeed, lies in the ability \r\nto ensure adequate and predictable resources to support \r\neconomic, social and environmental projects, as well as \r\nthe ability to invest in infrastructures for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n As a candidate for graduation from the list of \r\nleast developed countries, Cape Verde, now more than \r\never, needs both quantitative and qualitative \r\ndevelopment assistance support from the donor \r\ncommunity in order to succeed with its development. \r\n We commend donor countries for all their \r\ncommitments and efforts to double their aid assistance \r\nand technical capacity-building support to developing \r\ncountries, in particular those that have already met the \r\nofficial target of 0.7 per cent. We call on those that \r\nhave not yet fulfilled their commitments to do so. \r\n The positive initiative in the area of debt relief \r\nand cancellation that allows developing countries, in \r\nparticular the heavily indebted poor countries, to divert \r\nmore of their scarce resources for development \r\npurposes should be extended to middle-income \r\ncountries in need. The Intergovernmental Conference \r\non Middle-Income Countries, held in Madrid in March \r\n2007, and the follow-up meeting held in El Salvador in \r\nOctober 2007 called on the international community to \r\nsupport these countries in their efforts. \r\n The Government of Cape Verde is responsible for \r\nits own development process, for which we have \r\nundertaken profound reform in major areas of \r\ngovernance such as the judicial, economic and \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 16 \r\n \r\nfinancial sectors. Accordingly, as a key priority, we \r\nhave set up an economic environment capable of \r\nattracting foreign direct investment. However, it is \r\nessential that we supplement that with technical \r\nassistance and innovative public and private \r\npartnerships in order to strengthen access to financing \r\nfor small- and medium-sized enterprises. \r\n The focus on good governance, secured by the \r\nprinciples of accountability and transparency, is the \r\npillar of the Cape Verdean Government’s approach to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). To this end, the Government has undertaken \r\nthe arduous process of reform in different sectors, both \r\npublic and private, which has anchored growth \r\nreaching 10.8 per cent in 2006 and an average of  \r\n7 per cent from 2004 to 2007, in line with the level of \r\ngrowth established in the Poverty Reduction Strategy, \r\nto contribute to the achievement of the MDGs. \r\n The contribution of this growth to the reduction \r\nof poverty is illustrated in the latest Basic Indicator of \r\nthe Well-Being of Cape Verdean Society. Allow me to \r\nprovide the Assembly with some figures. The literacy \r\nrate in my country has reached 79 per cent. Access to \r\nhealth services in less than 30 minutes has reached \r\n74 per cent. Access to elementary education — a \r\nschool at less than 15 minutes from dwellings — has \r\nreached 70 per cent.  \r\n The consequences of this relatively good \r\nperformance cannot be harmful to Cape Verde; the \r\ndonor community must remain engaged in the Cape \r\nVerdean quest for development and reduction of \r\npoverty. Much vulnerability still persists. The \r\ngraduation of Cape Verde from the Group of Least \r\nDeveloped Countries must not be taken as an \r\nindication that Cape Verde does not need the support of \r\nits multilateral and bilateral partners, because that \r\ncould lead to the undoing of all the results that have \r\nbeen achieved. \r\n Moreover, lacking the capacity to build trade, \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed \r\ncountries, should make their trade commitments \r\ncarefully, according to their level of development and \r\ntheir need to retain the ability to implement the \r\ndevelopment policy that is most appropriate and most \r\ndesirable. In addition, developed countries should \r\nsupport access by handicapped developing countries to \r\nworld markets in this ever more globalized \r\nenvironment. It is important to eliminate export \r\nsubsidies, which would lead to substantial reduction in \r\ntrade-distorting measures, and aid for trade should be \r\nan essential complement to trade liberalization so that \r\ninternational competitiveness may be attained.  \r\n It is imperative to reform the architecture of the \r\ninternational financial system, in which the voice of \r\nthe least heard and most in need is not given due \r\nconsideration. Developing countries should be included \r\nin decision-making processes, and it is critical to \r\nensure that standards and codes are mutually \r\nconsistent, while being flexible enough to be \r\neffectively applied in both advanced and less advanced \r\nfinancial systems. \r\n To sum up, only collective efforts and responses \r\ncould better resolve our common problem and \r\nchallenge — the eradication of hunger, poverty, \r\ndiseases and the effects of climate change. Only a \r\nstrong global partnership and cooperation at all levels \r\ncould bring the achievement of the MDGs to the \r\nfruition to which we all are committed. We look \r\nforward to both the Doha Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to be held in Qatar, and to the third High-\r\nlevel Forum on Aid Effectiveness, to be held at Accra \r\nin 2008, which will provide us with an opportunity for \r\nmaking further progress. \r\n I thank the Secretary-General for the \r\ncomprehensive reports submitted under this agenda \r\nitem and the President for gathering us in such an \r\nimportant dialogue. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Senator Edgardo Angara of the \r\nPhilippines. \r\n Mr. Angara (Philippines): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment of the Philippines, we welcome this \r\nimportant conference in preparation for the review of \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus next year. \r\n The Philippines fully associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by Pakistan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n We commend the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nthe implementation of the Monterrey Consensus \r\n(A/62/217), its urgent call for donor countries to meet \r\ntheir aid commitments and its emphasis on domestic \r\nresource mobilization and South-South cooperation. \r\n As the Secretary-General’s report highlights, \r\nwhile there has been an increase in official \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n17 07-55833 \r\n \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) since the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, ODA flows have been marked by \r\nselectivity and uncertainty. There are many low-income \r\ncountries that receive very little aid, but few countries \r\nhave experienced surges in aid flows. ODA to the \r\nPhilippines, for instance, has steadily decreased for the \r\npast seven years. From $13.3 billion in 2000, ODA \r\ndecreased by 29 per cent to $9.5 billion in 2006. \r\nNevertheless, in the first quarter of 2007, the country’s \r\ngross national income grew at a record high of 6.9 per \r\ncent, the highest since 1999, outperforming other Asian \r\neconomies in the neighbourhood. \r\n Market interest rates are dropping, enabling the \r\nacceleration of bank lending activities and stimulating \r\ninvestment. Inflation is on the downtrend, registering \r\n2.2 per cent in March 2007, the lowest in two decades. \r\nThe peso, our currency, is appreciating, brought about \r\nby strong dollar inflows from portfolio and foreign \r\ndirect investments. Strong export earnings and \r\noverseas workers’ remittances have likewise \r\ncontributed to a robust currency and to the building up \r\nof our international reserves. Employment has reached \r\nan average of over 91 per cent for the last three years, \r\ncompared to 89.7 per cent in the past six years. The \r\nbudget deficit has been decreasing, having gone from \r\n$4.8 billion in 2002 to $1.5 billion in 2006, and will \r\nfurther decline $1.4 billion this year. \r\n These economic gains are primarily accounted for \r\nby our own bootstrap efforts to raise domestic revenues \r\nthrough fiscal and financial reforms. With strong \r\nmacroeconomic fundamentals in place, we initiated \r\npolicy reforms through legislation on mobilizing \r\ndomestic resources and strengthening the capital \r\nmarkets. \r\n But we cannot afford to be complacent. We have \r\nto sustain this accelerating growth and improve our \r\ncompetitiveness. More importantly, we have to \r\ntranslate our financial gains into larger investments, \r\nmore jobs, increased incomes and reduced poverty \r\nrates. \r\n Thus, we are investing in social services, \r\nparticularly health and education, infrastructure and \r\ngood governance, specifically, anti-corruption \r\nmeasures. The Government’s top priority is education. \r\nWe are working towards meeting the second \r\nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) — to ensure \r\nthat all boys and girls complete a full course of primary \r\neducation. We support the Basic Education Madrasah \r\nfor Muslim Mindanao and promote science, technology \r\nand engineering. \r\n In health, MDG 5, maternal mortality reduction, \r\nis our flagship programme. Child mortality is \r\ndeclining, but we continue to ensure that immunization \r\ncoverage is universal. \r\n To improve our infrastructure, we will invest \r\n$37.8 billion over the next three years in power and \r\nelectricity programmes, as well as in roads, bridges, \r\nrailways, air and water transport. Sustained benefits \r\nfrom our efforts in education, health and infrastructure, \r\nas with other aspects of the development agenda, will \r\ndepend on good governance and anti-corruption efforts. \r\n Our economic performance has given us \r\nopportunities to deepen our growth. But we face \r\nchallenges to which we need to respond. Consistent \r\nwith the report of the Secretary-General, the \r\nPhilippines will continue to improve the incomes and \r\nsavings that provide the domestic resource base to \r\nfinance human, social and physical investments. We \r\nwill also work on more equitable sharing of wealth and \r\nincome through reforms in access to financial \r\nresources, housing and social services. \r\n We will increase foreign exchange earnings \r\ncapacity through diversification and improvement of \r\nour exports, as well as by attracting quality foreign \r\ninvestments, while mobilizing external development \r\nassistance from the domestic business sector and civil \r\nsociety in public-private and global partnerships and \r\nexpanding the use of instruments such as debt for \r\ndevelopment or debt for nature swaps. \r\n Furthermore, we will implement budget reform \r\ninitiatives by shifting the focus of the budget process \r\nfrom inputs to results and by promoting transparency \r\nand accountability.  \r\n However, we urge the United Nations and the \r\ninternational financial institutions and developed \r\ncountries to continue to uphold the principles of the \r\nParis Declaration, which would do away with tied aid \r\nand donor-driven projects such as those we continue to \r\nwitness in the Philippines; to re-visit the concept of \r\ndebt sustainability and change this from the traditional \r\ncapacity to pay to the concept of preventing debt \r\npayments from hindering countries from meeting their \r\nMDGs; and to support South-South cooperation in \r\npartnership with emerging economies and developed \r\ncountries. Lastly, and this we urge very strongly: that \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 18 \r\n \r\nmultilateral agencies, in coordination with donor \r\ncountries, increase ODA commitments to developing \r\ncountries that sign and ratify the United Nations \r\nConvention Against Corruption. \r\n We hope to see the principles of the Paris \r\nDeclaration upheld at least until our review of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus in Doha next year. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. José Camargo, Deputy Minister for \r\nPublic Investments and External Finances of Bolivia. \r\n Mr. Camargo (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nBolivia expresses its recognition and thanks the United \r\nNations for this High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. Bolivia, on 22 January 2006, under the \r\npresidency of Evo Morales Ayma, initiated a profound \r\ntransformation of our State, reorienting development \r\nand focusing it towards a comprehensive, intercultural \r\nand diversified democratization of the economy. This \r\ntransformation finds its conceptual and strategic basis \r\nin the National Development Plan and in the firm wish \r\nthat development should benefit the poorest and most \r\nmarginalized sectors of society, as well as the native \r\npeoples. \r\n This plan is based on the concept of living well, \r\npart of our native and indigenous cultures, which have \r\na vision of the universe that go beyond the traditional \r\nforms of development. Living well represents a call for \r\nthe humanization of development, in the sense of \r\nrecognizing that cultural diversity makes possible \r\nsocial responsibility and duty in public administration. \r\nDevelopment thus becomes a collective decision-\r\nmaking process, and social action is an agent, not just a \r\nvessel for guidelines given from on high. \r\n Bolivia aims to create a decent, productive, \r\ndemocratic, unified and sovereign State as a \r\nprerequisite for building a new community-based \r\nsocio-economic model, in which the State and the \r\nmarket complement one another and public and private \r\nBolivian companies work together with foreign \r\ncompanies in domestic and foreign markets. \r\n In this sense, The National Development Plan \r\nconceives economic growth as a process of \r\nconsolidation, reinforcement and interaction among \r\nidentities; as the articulation of networks of exchange \r\nand intercultural interaction; as the stimulation of \r\nforms of community and of living together and as the \r\ncreation of mechanisms and institutional frameworks \r\nfor the protection, respect and promotion of diversity \r\nand rights in the productive process. \r\n In line with the declaration of the position of the \r\nRio Group, which recognizes that each country is \r\nresponsible for its own economic and social \r\ndevelopment, and in this context, the members of the \r\nRio Group in general, and Bolivia in particular, have \r\ndrawn up this development policy and strategy in their \r\nNational Development Plan. In this context, foreign \r\ntrade and the relationship with the international \r\ncommunity are fundamental pillars of this development \r\nplan and form the core of a sovereign Bolivia. This \r\nstrategy requires that international financial \r\norganizations, countries and governments that \r\ncooperate with Bolivia be our allies in this objective. \r\n On the other hand, developed and industrialized \r\ncountries are potential markets for Bolivian products. \r\nIf they open access to their markets, facilitate trade and \r\nlift restrictions, that would lead to the diversification of \r\nour production and technology, so we could move \r\nbeyond being a country that exports only raw \r\nmaterials. Providing increased value to our raw \r\nmaterials is the basic premise of the core of the \r\nBolivian plan of production. \r\n Bolivia, a country with vast and diverse natural, \r\necological, cultural and human riches, in proof of its \r\nlevel-headedness, wishes to provide guarantees foreign \r\ninvestment, in so far as this investment respects and \r\nobserves the decisions made by an honourable and \r\nsovereign State. \r\n Over the past three years, Bolivia has modified \r\nthe pattern of resources for financing its development. \r\nWe are now emphasizing more internal resources over \r\nthose coming from international, multilateral and \r\nbilateral cooperation, whether such resources are \r\nreimbursable or not. We would thus like to draw the \r\nattention of the international community to the fact that \r\nBolivia, in spite of the fact that we are going through a \r\ngood economic period, still needs international \r\ncooperation if our development is to be sustainable. \r\n For Bolivia, the Monterrey Consensus was, \r\nbeyond any doubt, a significant step forward in \r\naddressing problems of financing for development. \r\nAlthough there was an increase in the percentage of \r\nofficial development assistance, there is no doubt that a \r\ngreat deal still remains to be done before we can \r\nachieve our objectives. Bolivia therefore believes that \r\nwe must continue our efforts to improve the follow-up \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n19 07-55833 \r\n \r\nmachinery to implement the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nbearing in mind the forthcoming Doha Conference. In \r\nthis context, Bolivia believes that it is important to \r\npromote further reform of the world financial system, \r\nendowing it with greater social awareness and effective \r\nparticipation by all countries in international financing \r\norganizations. Also, it is necessary that we remove \r\nbarriers and subsidies that distort trade, because there \r\nare still inequalities that harm developing countries. \r\nThose are the challenges that will impel us to display a \r\nhigh level of political will at Doha. \r\n Finally, Bolivia aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Pakistan on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China and with the statement to be \r\nmade by the representative of Chile on behalf of the \r\nRio Group. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Talaat Abdel Malek, Deputy \r\nMinister for International Cooperation of Egypt. \r\n Mr. Abdel Malek (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express my appreciation to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for convening \r\nthis High-level Dialogue and to express Egypt’s \r\nsupport for the statements made by the representative \r\nof Benin on behalf of the African Group and by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n Over the past few years, we have witnessed \r\nnumerous meetings and conferences on development \r\nissues. However, progress in addressing these \r\ninternational issues cannot be achieved without strong \r\nnational and international political will. In recent years, \r\ndeveloping countries have made great progress along \r\nthe path to political, economic and social reform. This, \r\nin turn, imposes parallel obligations on developed \r\ncountries to fulfil their commitments, which include \r\nthe following. \r\n First, an enabling international environment \r\nshould be created that complements the national \r\ncapacity-building efforts of developing countries in the \r\nvarious fields of development, including the \r\nenhancement of human resources, and that provide \r\nadequate space for these countries to maintain a \r\nbalance between their international commitments and \r\ntheir national policies. \r\n Secondly, the scope and fields of foreign direct \r\ninvestment should be expanded in the greatest possible \r\nnumber of developing countries, and technical \r\nassistance by the international community should be \r\nintensified to support the efforts of developing \r\ncountries to enact rules and laws for foreign investment \r\nand to encourage investment in infrastructure. It is also \r\nimportant to intensify international cooperation that \r\nwould support increased capital flows between the \r\ncountries of the South, within the framework of South-\r\nSouth cooperation, including trilateral cooperation. \r\n Thirdly, we should take on serious steps to \r\nachieve a breakthrough in the Doha Round of trade \r\nnegotiations, with its development objectives. Egypt \r\nalso calls for the intensification of trade-related \r\ninternational technical assistance directed towards \r\ndeveloping countries in the service sector, in the light \r\nof the projected increase of that sector’s share in the \r\noverall volume of international trade. \r\n Fourthly, the developed countries should fulfil \r\ntheir pledges to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross \r\nnational income to official development assistance. The \r\nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness has not yet been \r\nimplemented properly. An international mechanism is \r\nneeded to monitor the effective fulfilment of those \r\ninternational pledges, along with funding for the \r\ndevelopment activities of the United Nations. We \r\nwelcome international efforts to find new sources of \r\nfinancing for development. We also welcome \r\nindividual initiatives to combat poverty, such as those \r\nof the private sector and people like Bill Gates, Warren \r\nBuffet, Ted Turner and others. \r\n Fifthly, innovative ways to deal with the \r\nservicing of foreign debt are needed. Let me refer here \r\nto the debt initiative which has been successfully \r\nimplemented in Egypt. I should also note the slow pace \r\nof implementing the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\n(HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief \r\nInitiative for the least developed countries and the fact \r\nthat these two initiatives do not include the debts of \r\nmiddle income countries. We recommend the \r\nestablishment of an international mechanism that \r\nwould include all debtors to deal with debt in an \r\nintegrated and institutional manner, governed by rules \r\nnot subject to conditionalities, and that would give \r\ndeveloping countries a better chance to borrow on \r\ninternational financial markets. \r\n Sixthly, reform of the global financial and \r\nmonetary system, should be expedited. To do this, three \r\nthings are needed: first, increased participation by \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 20 \r\n \r\ndeveloping countries in international economic \r\ndecision-making; secondly, adequate controls to \r\naccommodate international fluctuations and crises in \r\norder not to repeat recent events in the mortgage and \r\nreal estate markets in the United States; and thirdly, the \r\ndevelopment of international financing services in a \r\nway that is consonant with the increasing needs of \r\nmiddle-income countries.  \r\n As a middle-income country, Egypt has achieved \r\nprogress in many areas of reform through the \r\ndevelopment of tax and customs laws, reform of \r\ninvestment regulations and the creation of a positive \r\nand attractive environment for investments, in \r\ncooperation with the World Bank and other \r\ninternational and regional financial institutions. We \r\nhave also reformed the banking sector and accelerated \r\nthe process of privatization. This has placed Egypt at \r\nthe top among developing countries in the field of \r\ninstitutional economic reform, according to the World \r\nBank’s Doing Business project. It also accounts for \r\nEgypt’s high rank among emerging markets in \r\nattracting foreign investment, which has been in the \r\nrange of over $10 billion during the first 10 months of \r\nthis year. Furthermore, studies indicate that Egypt is on \r\ntrack to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Building a new international consensus requires \r\nstrong United Nations leadership in order to formulate \r\nand implement post-2015 development goals \r\nparticularly in the light of new development challenges \r\nthat require concerted international efforts. These \r\ninclude the women’s empowerment, children’s rights, \r\nthe transborder spread of disease, addressing the \r\nphenomenon of climate change, improving education \r\nand training in order to provide suitable opportunities \r\nfor decent work and dealing with the phenomenon of \r\nmigration and its related issues in both recipient \r\ncountries and countries of origin. \r\n Hence, we must come out of this meeting with \r\nthe political will to strengthen the United Nations \r\ndevelopment role so that the Organization can adapt to \r\nthe growing international development agenda in the \r\neconomic and social fields. During the coming period, \r\nthe delegation of Egypt will present specific proposals \r\naimed at strengthening the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sergei Storchak, Deputy Minister \r\nof Finance of the Russian Federation. \r\n Mr. Storchak (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I would like to take this opportunity to share \r\nwith you the position of the Russian delegation on \r\nfinancing for development and the implementation of \r\nthe decisions of the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development. \r\n The recent acceleration in the economic \r\ndevelopment of a large number of developing countries \r\nis a unique phenomenon. The rate of economic growth \r\nof middle- and low-income countries during the past \r\nfive years is 5 per cent annually on average. Never in \r\nthe history of mankind have such large sections of the \r\npopulation had the opportunity to overcome poverty. If \r\nwe manage to maintain current trends and ensure stable \r\ndevelopment, the world will be a completely different \r\nplace in just a few decades — and not over the course \r\nof centuries, as has been the case in the past. \r\n In that connection, we view the meeting in Doha \r\nas one of the key events aimed at ensuring practical \r\nimplementation of the principle of global partnership \r\nfor development. It is our understanding that the \r\nconference will analyse the progress made by all \r\nparties in the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nagreements, reaffirm the main objectives in the field of \r\nfinancing for development, identify the bottlenecks in \r\nthe implementation of the post-Monterrey agenda and \r\ndevelop measures to overcome them. \r\n We believe that the upcoming conference should \r\naffirm the importance of steps undertaken at the \r\nnational level to mobilize domestic resources as the \r\nbasis for ensuring economic growth and eradicating \r\npoverty. The conference is also called upon to \r\nformulate the proposals of the international community \r\non enhancing the efficiency of recipient countries’ own \r\nefforts. In that context, we believe that the conference \r\nin Doha should take note of the steps being undertaken \r\nby a number of financial institutions, primarily the \r\nWorld Bank, and by some donor countries to assist the \r\nrecipient countries in the elaboration and \r\nimplementation of large infrastructure projects and \r\nshould call on other donors to step up efforts in this \r\nfield. Attention to those matters has significantly \r\nflagged recently. \r\n In our opinion, the upcoming meeting should also \r\nfocus on innovative approaches to mobilizing resources \r\nfor development, such as the International Finance \r\nFacility for Immunization, advance market \r\ncommitments on vaccines and others. We need to \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n21 07-55833 \r\n \r\nanalyse the advantages and shortcomings of such \r\nmechanisms and evaluate the prospects for their future \r\ndissemination. Another theme for discussion is the \r\nimplementation of the intermediate results of other \r\nmajor international initiatives in the field of \r\ndevelopment assistance, for example, the Multilateral \r\nDebt Relief Initiative for the poorest countries, the \r\nimplementation of which is not proceeding as smoothly \r\nas we would hope. \r\n Another agenda item of the Doha conference \r\ncould be a discussion of the increasing role of the \r\nso-called new donors in providing development \r\nassistance. Of course, new and traditional donors \r\nshould be united in promoting the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and ensuring \r\nsustainable global development. But it should be \r\nclearly understood that the expansion of the donor \r\ncommunity not only opens new prospects, but also \r\ngives rise to specific challenges requiring the attention \r\nof the international community, such as the \r\ncoordination and harmonization of donor efforts and \r\nthe need to avoid increasing the debt burden of \r\nrecipient countries. We are ready to prepare for the \r\ndebate on those issues, drawing on the outcomes of the \r\ndiscussion held during the Russian presidency of the \r\nG8 on the role of new donors in the international donor \r\ncommunity. \r\n We fully subscribe to the principles of global \r\npartnership stipulated, in particular, in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and the Monterrey Consensus and intend to \r\nincrease our contribution to the common efforts in the \r\nfield of international development assistance. \r\n In recent years, the Russian Federation has been \r\nactively assisting such international processes. The \r\nfederal budget allocates funds to assist the poorest \r\ncountries of the world through participation in the \r\nprogrammes and initiatives implemented by \r\nmultilateral organizations, cancellation of debt on a \r\nbilateral basis, provision of humanitarian assistance \r\nand the implementation of Russian initiatives presented \r\nduring the Russian presidency of the G8. Additionally, \r\nRussia is stepping up its participation in international \r\nforums on issues related to the effectiveness of \r\ndevelopment assistance. \r\n The volume of Russian assistance is growing \r\ngradually, and, even without taking into account the \r\ncancellation of debt, it will amount to $210 million in \r\n2007. Furthermore, in the course of its G8 presidency, \r\nRussia undertook additional obligations totalling \r\napproximately $600 million to finance, in the course of \r\nthe four to five coming years, initiatives in the fields of \r\nfighting infections diseases, education and overcoming \r\nenergy poverty in developing countries. \r\n In order to put Russian activity over the past 10 \r\nyears in the area of international development \r\nassistance on a systematic basis, a scheme for the \r\nParticipation of the Russian Federation in International \r\nDevelopment Assistance was prepared and approved in \r\nJune 2007 by the President of the Russian Federation. \r\nThe adoption of the scheme, which outlines the basic \r\nprinciples, goals, objectives and guidelines of this \r\nwork, has become an important step in establishing an \r\neffective development assistance mechanism in the \r\nRussian Federation. In the preparation of the \r\ndocument, due account was taken of the guidelines and \r\nrecommendations of the international community and \r\nof the Monterrey Consensus and the Paris Declaration \r\non Aid Effectiveness. The document will ensure a \r\nsystemic approach to the activities of Russian agencies, \r\ncreate an effective system for providing development \r\nassistance and help achieve the required economic and \r\nsocial effect in the countries that receive Russian \r\nassistance. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm our \r\nadherence to the commitments made in the field of \r\nfinancing for development, and I express the hope that \r\nthe Doha conference will become a turning point in \r\npoverty eradication and achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Anne Stenhammer, State Secretary \r\nof International Development of Norway. \r\n Ms. Stenhammer (Norway): While Norway \r\nattaches great importance to all six core areas of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, today I would like to share with \r\nyou some thoughts on the need for good governance, \r\nwith a particular focus on the gender aspect. I would \r\nalso like to highlight the need for increased \r\ndevelopment assistance and coherence between donors, \r\nand between providers of aid and their partner \r\ncountries. \r\n As we all know, but seldom emphasize, good \r\ngovernance is more than formal democracy and sound \r\nmacroeconomic management. Those are fundamental \r\ningredients, but they do little for social and sustainable \r\neconomic development and poverty reduction, unless \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 22 \r\n \r\nthey are supplemented by other, more specific \r\nmeasures. I would like to mention three such measures. \r\n First, a strong, transparent, and non-corrupt State \r\nis absolutely vital. That requires political will and the \r\nright attitude among national elites, including the will \r\nto impose taxes to pay for a sound public sector, with \r\nappropriate pay for public officials in strong, \r\naccountable government institutions. \r\n Secondly, an active and ambitious policy not only \r\ntowards entrepreneurship, investment and growth, but \r\nalso as regards fair distribution and equal opportunities \r\nfor all is necessary. While taxation and the provision of \r\npublic services are important, experience from many \r\ncountries shows that the single most important factor in \r\nfighting poverty is the provision of decent work. Job \r\ncreation, opportunities for promotion and the \r\nprotection of workers’ rights are all vital in that \r\nrespect. \r\n Thirdly, there must be a proactive policy to \r\npromote the rights and opportunities of one half of \r\nevery country’s population: its women. Good \r\ngovernance is not possible unless gender equality is \r\nmade an explicit goal. As Norway’s experience shows, \r\npromoting gender equality is a matter of human rights \r\nand also makes very good economic sense. \r\n Women have the primary responsibility for \r\nunpaid housework and care-related tasks. We need to \r\nacknowledge both the part played by women and their \r\npotential as economic actors that benefit society in \r\ngeneral. \r\n Financing for gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women is the main theme for the \r\n2008 session of the United Nations Commission on the \r\nStatus of Women. We need to keep that key aspect of \r\ndevelopment in mind in the broader financing for \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\n For a number of years, Norway has been \r\nexceeding the development assistance target rate of \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income. In 2008, we plan \r\nto achieve a rate of 0.98 per cent. Our aim is to \r\nincrease that to 1 per cent by 2010 and exceed that \r\nfigure in the future. Priority has been given, and will \r\ncontinue to be given, to funding development in the \r\nleast developed countries. \r\n Norway actively supports the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and is giving special \r\npriority to Goals 4 and 5, which aim at reducing child \r\nmortality and improving maternal health. The fight \r\nagainst AIDS, malaria and the other diseases, Goal 6, is \r\nalso a priority. Norway has pledged $1 billion for the \r\nvaccination of children in developing countries \r\nbetween 2000 and 2015. \r\n We appreciate the strong emphasis placed on the \r\nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General.  \r\n Finally, we welcome the various initiatives that \r\nhave been taken in relation to policy coherence, \r\nincluding the recent collaboration between the \r\nInternational Labour Organization and the World Trade \r\nOrganization on the important link between trade and \r\nemployment. That is a significant breakthrough as \r\nregards ensuring better and more coherent governance \r\nat the global level. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ib Petersen, State Secretary for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Denmark. \r\n Mr. Petersen (Denmark): Allow me to start by \r\nassociating myself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Portugal on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. \r\n Five years ago in Monterrey, a compact was \r\nforged between rich and poor countries in support of \r\nthe objectives contained in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. Developing countries reaffirmed their \r\nundertakings to pursue the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, and donor countries their commitments to \r\nsupport those efforts.  \r\n This year, we have reached the halfway point \r\ntowards 2015. The good news is that all major regions \r\nare on track to reducing the proportion of people living \r\nin extreme poverty by 2015 to below the 1990 rate. \r\nThat is, all regions but one are on track: in \r\nSub-Saharan Africa, renewed efforts must be made in \r\nthe years to come. \r\n On the negative side, overall progress is too slow. \r\nThe message is therefore clear: developing countries \r\nand donor countries alike must step up their efforts. \r\nThe upcoming Doha conference in 2008 will be an \r\nimportant rallying point in that respect. \r\n Denmark is one of only five countries that have \r\nreached — and surpassed — the international agreed \r\ntarget of 0.7 percent of gross domestic product as \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA). As the \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n23 07-55833 \r\n \r\nAssembly is aware, the European Union has agreed on \r\nan ambitious ODA timetable to reach 0.7 in 2015 and \r\nset new ambitious targets for assistance to Africa. \r\nDenmark looks forward to welcoming European Union \r\ncolleagues and others to the group of “point seven” \r\ncountries. We hope that even more donor countries will \r\nbe joining the group in the future.  \r\n Increased ODA is but one aspect of our efforts, \r\nhowever. The need to further improve the quality of \r\naid, not least by strengthening the alignment and \r\nharmonization of aid in line with the commitments \r\nundertaken in the Paris Declaration, remains important. \r\nThe upcoming meeting in Accra next year is important \r\nin that respect. \r\n Focus on international support and the need to \r\nstrengthen ODA, quantitatively as well as qualitatively, \r\nshould not overshadow the point made by the European \r\nUnion presidency and agreed in Monterrey, namely, \r\nthat every country has the primary responsibility for its \r\nown development and that good governance, sound \r\npolicies and sound national development strategies \r\nremain at the centre of any successful effort to attain \r\npro-poor economic growth and eradicate poverty. Key \r\nelements remain: strengthening governance, combating \r\ncorruption, redirecting government revenues, \r\nincreasing domestic savings, and — not least — \r\nfurthering private sector development and \r\nentrepreneurship. \r\n Denmark is a strong supporter of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and believes that the time \r\nhas come for a United Nations summit focusing on \r\nprogress in the attainment of those goals.  \r\n One important stepping stone towards the \r\neradication of poverty and the fulfilment of the \r\ninterlinked MDGs is the achievement of gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women. Denmark \r\ntherefore intends to put special emphasis on Goal 3, on \r\ngender equality. We especially want to focus on \r\nwomen’s economic empowerment, as this should be at \r\nthe core of the efforts to combat poverty.  \r\n That is, unfortunately, still not the case. In many \r\ncountries, efforts in that regard are still much too weak \r\nto unleash the full potential of women as entrepreneurs \r\nand drivers of economic development. It is widely \r\ndocumented that women do not have equal access to \r\nfinancial resources and to land, and there are other \r\nmore indirectly discriminating barriers for women’s \r\nactive participation in formal economic activity. That \r\ninefficient use of human resources cannot be afforded, \r\nif countries are to achieve the MDGs. \r\n In an effort to raise awareness and create new \r\nmomentum with regard to the economic empowerment \r\nof women, the Danish Government will establish a \r\nhigh-level international network and a series of \r\nactivities in 2008 under the heading “Women Mean \r\nBusiness”. The idea is that the network would be very \r\nmuch representative of all regions in the world. \r\n I would also like to highlight the major challenge \r\nof climate change, for which financing is a very crucial \r\nelement of our common efforts. The Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change has documented that global \r\nwarming continues to increase and is taking place far \r\nquicker than previously thought. The consequences of \r\nthis will be dramatic and irreversible, and climate \r\nchange will affect the poorest and the weakest the \r\nmost, despite the fact that the poorest developing \r\ncountries have contributed least to the problem. \r\n Countries have very different capacities to act. \r\nThere is a need to give a strong helping hand to the \r\npoorest countries, enabling them to adapt to climate \r\nchange and to access technologies that will help \r\nprevent further warming. Global warming must not \r\nundermine the global fight against poverty. \r\n We must base our joint efforts on the notion of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. Adaptation \r\nto and mitigation of climate change is expensive, but it \r\nis more expensive to ignore the problem. The challenge \r\nof climate change is a development challenge. \r\nIncreased ODA is necessary, and we need to think of \r\ninnovative ways in which public financing can catalyse \r\nother sources of financing, such as private investments. \r\n We must deal with the challenge of climate \r\nchange on a global level. Denmark is pleased that it \r\nwill host the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference — the fifteenth Conference of Parties to \r\nthe Convention — in December 2009. We will, among \r\nother things, work to ensure that consideration for the \r\npoorest countries’ interests will play an important role \r\nin a new agreement. Our common ambition should be \r\nvery high. We must reach consensus on an effective \r\nand multilateral post-Kyoto agreement. The Climate \r\nChange Conference in Copenhagen is our last chance if \r\nthe agreement is to enter into force by 2012. \r\n There is no doubt that in order to achieve the \r\nMDGs, not only at the global level, but also in \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 24 \r\n \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, we need to do more and do it \r\nfaster. The Monterrey Consensus made this a joint \r\nundertaking. Developing countries must pursue sound \r\npolicies that can make the goals attainable, and donor \r\ncountries must support those efforts through increased \r\nODA and through their clear commitment to the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. \r\n There is solid ground to build on, but it will take \r\na common and determined effort in a number of areas, \r\nincluding climate change and the empowerment of \r\nwomen, to make sure that, come 2015, we will have \r\nreached the goals we set out to achieve. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency the Baroness Shriti Vadera, \r\nDevelopment Minister of the United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland. \r\n Baroness Vadera (United Kingdom): The United \r\nKingdom agrees with the statement made by my \r\nPortuguese colleague on behalf of the European Union. \r\nI especially welcome the acknowledgement of the \r\nimportance of women’s economic empowerment to \r\ntackle poverty. \r\n The United Nations is the world’s most legitimate \r\nand important forum in which to discuss our shared \r\ninterests, but I welcome this High-level Dialogue to \r\nconsider our shared promises. Five years ago, the world \r\ncame together in Monterrey, Mexico, to make those \r\npromises. We reached a consensus between rich and \r\npoor, to achieve sustainable development, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. Donor \r\ncountries promised to increase their aid. Developing \r\ncountries promised to improve governance, domestic \r\nresource mobilization and the conditions for investment, \r\neconomic growth and long-term prosperity for all. \r\n The year 2005 was a landmark year for financing \r\nfor development. At the World Summit here in New \r\nYork, the G8 summit in Gleneagles, the European \r\nUnion summit and in the Paris Declaration on Aid \r\nEffectiveness, we reaffirmed the commitments of \r\nMonterrey and set ourselves specific targets for \r\nincreased aid. It is now time to deliver on those \r\npromises. \r\n I am proud that the United Kingdom is meeting \r\nits commitments. Since 1997, we have trebled our \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) levels, which \r\nare now historically higher than at any other time in \r\nour history. In 2006, we became the world’s second \r\nlargest donor, supporting countries around the world to \r\nachieve their goals. We pay tribute to the results our \r\npartner countries are achieving in improving health and \r\neducation outcomes and increasing growth, using our \r\nresources and their own. \r\n On 10 October, the Government of the United \r\nKingdom announced that by 2010-2011 our ODA will \r\nincrease to 0.56 per cent of gross national income, \r\nequivalent to $18 billion per annum. We will therefore \r\ndeliver on the commitments we made at the United \r\nNations, the European Union and Gleneagles, \r\nincluding to double our aid to Africa. We are on track \r\nto increase ODA to 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome by 2013, two years ahead of the European \r\nUnion target. \r\n We are pleased that the underlying trend of global \r\naid is on the rise. The exceptionally high levels of debt \r\nrelief in 2005 mean that global ODA fell in 2006 and \r\n2007. We should not let that technical decrease be used \r\nby sceptics to obfuscate the underlying 30 per cent \r\nincrease of aid since Monterrey in 2002. Nevertheless, \r\ndespite that trend, we know that collectively, as a \r\nglobal donor community, we need to keep our promises \r\nand redouble our efforts. \r\n All donors face budgetary pressures and \r\ncompeting domestic priorities. But we know that if we \r\nhave the political will, there are solutions, including \r\nmany innovative financing ideas that have been \r\nproposed and developed, such as the International \r\nFinance Facility for Immunization and the \r\nInternational Drug Purchase Facility, using air \r\npassenger levies. \r\n As the Secretary-General said two weeks ago, we \r\nneed urgent concerted action because we know that \r\nnearly all the MDGs are globally off-track, and that \r\nsome countries are falling far behind, especially in \r\nAfrica. \r\n I welcome this important High-level Dialogue as \r\na key stepping stone to getting ourselves back on track. \r\nI agree with those who say we do not need more \r\ncommitments, studies or reports; we need delivery. In \r\nthe words of the President of the General Assembly of \r\nthis morning, time is running out. As my Prime \r\nMinister, Gordon Brown, said in July in New York, we \r\nface a development emergency that needs emergency \r\naction. We must work together, one community with a \r\ncommon aim. \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n25 07-55833 \r\n \r\n The United Kingdom therefore agrees with the \r\nthree proposals of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nAfrica Steering Group of the Secretary-General. \r\n First, effective instruments for health, education, \r\nagriculture, food security, infrastructure and statistical \r\nsystems are needed. We are already working with \r\nothers in the International Health Partnership for \r\ndonors and health agencies to coordinate and support \r\ncountry-owned health plans for the creation of \r\npermanent health systems. We have a Fast Track \r\nInitiative to provide every child with a quality \r\neducation. But more needs to be done. \r\n Secondly, the Steering Group emphasized long-\r\nterm predictable aid. That is an absolute priority, in \r\norder to enable our partner countries to plan to build \r\neffective and permanent systems to reach the MDGs. \r\nWithout knowing if teachers can be paid, you cannot \r\nbuild an education system; without knowing if the \r\nhealth system will be funded, you cannot train health \r\nworkers; without long-term financing, there can be no \r\ncommitment to infrastructure. \r\n Thirdly, we need donor coordination, pulling our \r\nseparate projects together into one coherent programme \r\nand supporting the strategies of our partner \r\nGovernments. Our efforts and initiatives should not \r\ncompete and detract from one another but be greater \r\nthan the sum of their parts. \r\n The one lesson we have learned is that aid \r\ndelivers long-term impact only when it is led by \r\npartner countries. I want to commend the paper by the \r\nWorld Bank on “Country-based scaling up”, which was \r\ndiscussed this weekend at the World Bank Group/ \r\nInternational Monetary Fund annual meetings. I also \r\nwant to acknowledge the leadership of my Dutch and \r\nSwedish colleagues in developing the Results and \r\nResources Partnership process for scaling up in 2008, \r\nwhich we, the World Bank and others support. \r\n While aid is necessary to most developing \r\ncountries, in no country is it sufficient to meet the \r\ndevelopment goals. We commend the aspiration of \r\npartner countries for growth and economic self \r\nsufficiency — an aspiration that donors have not \r\nalways supported and paid as much attention to as they \r\nshould have. Without growth, sustainable human \r\ndevelopment is a largely theoretical proposition. \r\n But here, too, we have an obligation. No country \r\nhas reduced poverty in the past 30 years without also \r\nincreasing trade. We must therefore deliver on the \r\npromise of the Doha trade round. We need a good deal \r\nfor poor countries, and we need it now. There is \r\nnothing to gain by delaying agreement any further. In \r\naddition to creating fair trade rules, we need to equip \r\ncountries to compete effectively and integrate into the \r\nglobal marketplace. Delivering on aid for trade is \r\ntherefore an essential element of financing for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In addition, we must not ignore climate change. \r\nThe impact of climate change is felt disproportionately \r\nby low-emissions poor countries. Rather than facing \r\nthe threats we fear, they are living the daily reality of \r\nwater shortages, crop failures, floods and diseases. In \r\n2005, in the United Kingdom, civil society created a \r\ncampaign for Gleneagles called “Make Poverty \r\nHistory”. Unless we tackle climate change and assist \r\npoor countries in adapting to its impact, we will not \r\njust fail to meet development goals, we will instead \r\nensure that poverty becomes the future. Climate change \r\nis about more than development. It is about justice. \r\n To achieve a truly collective effort, we need the \r\nleadership that only the United Nations can provide. \r\nThat is why our Prime Minister has urged the \r\nSecretary-General to convene a United Nations \r\nmeeting during 2008 in the run-up to the Doha \r\nConference on Financing for Development, so that \r\nheads of Government can come together to accelerate \r\naction towards our goals. It would create a rallying \r\npoint for the world, bringing together the private \r\nsector, civil society, non-governmental organizations \r\nand faith groups in a call to action that would urge \r\nGovernments to act before it is too late. \r\n I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in \r\nthis High-level Dialogue and to hear the important \r\nstatements made by others. I hope this Dialogue will be \r\nthe stepping stone to a special rallying meeting at the \r\nUnited Nations in 2008, to a successful financing for \r\ndevelopment Conference in Doha and, beyond that, to \r\nachieving our targets, year on year, as we reach 2015.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rahmat Waluyanto, Senior Deputy \r\nMinister of Finance of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Waluyanto: The Indonesian delegation \r\nwelcomes the convening of this High-level Dialogue of \r\nthe General Assembly on Financing for Development \r\nand commends the President of the Assembly for this \r\ninitiative. I also take this opportunity to associate \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 26 \r\n \r\nmyself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n Indonesia has always placed high importance on \r\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). My President has reiterated twice in this Hall \r\nthat practical efforts to alleviate poverty must be \r\npromoted and that developing countries must move \r\nforward with the ready support of developed countries \r\nin a spirit of global partnership. \r\n Yet the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/62/217) suggests that although progress has been \r\nmade in the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, much more needs to be done so that most \r\ndeveloping countries can escape the vicious cycle of \r\npoverty, lack of productive capacity, supply-side \r\nconstraints and vulnerability to external economic and \r\nfinancial shocks. Lack of capacity in managing \r\nexternal debt also continues to weigh down fiscal \r\nefforts, and the threat of a debt crisis remains \r\nprevalent. Trade, as one of the engines of growth, has \r\nalso yet to play its inherent role of alleviating poverty. \r\n If we are truly committed to attaining the MDGs \r\nwithin the specified time frame, more commitments \r\nneed to be implemented. We cannot expect to continue \r\nlooking into the past to attain better results. We must \r\nlook within to generate the necessary development, so \r\nthat the international community can truly engage us in \r\na global partnership. \r\n The essence of the Monterrey Consensus is to \r\npromote international cooperation and partnership in \r\norder to mobilize resources for development. That \r\nglobal partnership, although the responsibility of \r\ndeveloping States, inherently requires the full support \r\nof developed countries and the international \r\ncommunity to establish sustainable financing for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In order to attain that, efforts must be invested in \r\ncontinuously developing domestic capacities to \r\ngenerate the necessary resources to finance \r\ndevelopment. Until now, those resources have been \r\nfocused on mobilizing domestic savings and attracting \r\nprivate capital inflows. We have learned that to \r\neffectively implement that practice, we must foster the \r\nestablishment of a sound institutional framework that \r\nsupports domestic economic policies. Only through the \r\nestablishment of stable macroeconomic policy can we \r\nhope to provide market confidence and attract foreign \r\ndirect investment. Along those lines, we must strive to \r\ncreate a regulatory policy design that is both \r\ntransparent and consistent, including a reliable legal \r\nframework to foster a favourable investment climate. \r\n One of the potential ways to generate our own \r\nresources for development is to empower the domestic \r\nbond market. Through the use of a fully operational \r\nbond market, countries can be provided with more \r\nfunds to finance their development programmes, while \r\nalso supporting the Government with flexibility, better \r\nplanning capacity and improved accountability. We \r\nstress the importance of a sound capital market as an \r\nalternative source of financing for the real sector, and \r\nalso for the Government budget. By the same token, \r\ncountries must remain vigilant in their fiscal resilience \r\nand must ensure the sustainability of utilizing those \r\nmeans. \r\n In order to build a workable domestic bond \r\nmarket, we need to cooperate together. Developing \r\ncountries need support from developed countries to \r\nimprove governance regulation, which will generate \r\nmarket confidence, and to build capital market \r\ninfrastructure and transparency. In that regard, it is \r\nnecessary that attention be given to the development of \r\nthe Government bond market in a comprehensive \r\nmanner that would later support the development of a \r\ndomestic bond market as an alternative source of \r\nfinancing for development, along with the traditional \r\nsources through the banking sector and international or \r\nforeign loans. Consequently, developing countries also \r\nneed assistance in building a clear legal framework, \r\nproviding the certainty of law, in order to resolve \r\ndisputes and facilitate cross-border trading.  \r\n As global trade and financial links intensify, \r\ngrowth in one economy will have an impact on others. \r\nAccordingly, it will be in the interest of individual \r\neconomies to foster the economic stability and \r\nprosperity of others. Ignoring that would result in a \r\ngreater risk of spill-over economic effects. We must \r\ntherefore galvanize effort to minimize the risk of \r\nrecurring systemic crises by developing early warning \r\nsystems, improving communication for effective policy \r\nformulation, preparing adequate resources and \r\ngenerating broad support to assist affected countries. \r\n We also emphasize our concern regarding climate \r\nchange, which poses a real threat and a present danger, \r\nnot only to sustainable development, but to our very \r\nexistence. We call for the international community to \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n27 07-55833 \r\n \r\nsupport developing countries in addressing the threat. \r\nWith this issue now becoming more of a concern for \r\nministers of finance and economic development, \r\nIndonesia will host a high-level event on climate \r\nchange for finance ministers, the first of its kind, in \r\nDecember 2007. We believe that that meeting will be a \r\ngood opportunity for those ministers to play an \r\nimportant role in the issue of climate change through \r\nthe formulation of relevant policies in areas such as \r\nfiscal policy, risk management, insurance, finance \r\npolicy and the power to direct the flow of funds and \r\ninvestments. \r\n To conclude, Indonesia is very confident that \r\npertinent elements produced by this Dialogue will add \r\nvalue in the discussion to come. Hence, the summary \r\nof this meeting should be fully considered by the \r\nupcoming Economic and Social Council Development \r\nCooperation Forum and by the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held \r\nin Doha, Qatar, as a key milestone to promote \r\ncoherency in implementing international policies on \r\nfinancing for development. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. László Várkonyi, State Secretary \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Hungary. \r\n Mr. Várkonyi (Hungary): Please allow me to \r\nexpress Hungary’s appreciation to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for organizing this High-level \r\nDialogue. We welcome and support the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on financing for development \r\n(A/62/217), and it is a pleasure for me to participate in \r\nsuch an important event. \r\n I would like to voice strong support for the \r\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Development is for the benefit of all \r\nhumankind; therefore, as far as our possibilities permit, \r\nwe are strongly committed to offering increasing \r\nfinancial support to the developing world. As a \r\nmember of the international donor community, we \r\nshare the principles adopted in Monterrey in 2002. \r\n The Government of Hungary has been making \r\nefforts in order to increase the volume of aid offered to \r\nthe developing world. In 2006, Hungary reached the \r\nlevel of 0.13 per cent of its gross national income \r\n(GNI) for official development assistance (ODA), thus, \r\nmaking a significant stride towards the individual 0.17 \r\nper cent target for 2010. \r\n However, let me emphasize that increasing the \r\namount of development funds will not by itself result \r\nin reaching the Millennium Development Goals. First \r\nand foremost, it is necessary to use these amounts \r\neffectively — and effectiveness must be visible in both \r\ndonor and partner countries. In this regard, special \r\nattention must be paid to donor coordination and to \r\npolicy coherence for development. Moreover, we must \r\nalso bear in mind that adjusting enlarged assistance to \r\nthe specific and realistic needs of partner countries is \r\nof crucial importance. The appropriate adjustment of \r\nresources is key to their adequate utilization. \r\n Another important issue is the fact that the key to \r\nsuccessful development lies within the developing \r\ncountries themselves. The international donor \r\ncommunity can be successful only through the progress \r\nof these developing countries. Having gone through its \r\nown transition process, Hungary is ready to offer its \r\nexperience to all developing countries committed to \r\nimplementing good governance. \r\n Stability of trade based on predictable \r\nmultilateral rules and regulations is the engine of \r\neconomic growth. Besides the role and importance of \r\ntraditional North-South commercial relations, we also \r\ndeem significant the ever increasing South-South \r\ncommerce. A number of studies have supported the \r\nimportance of trade among developing countries and \r\nthe advantages gained from the reduction of tariff and \r\nnon-tariff trade barriers. We are convinced that trade \r\nliberalization can play a vital role in poverty reduction \r\nand in attaining economic growth in the least \r\ndeveloping countries and in countries with small and \r\nfragile economies. \r\n However, granting opportunities for market \r\naccess alone is not sufficient for those countries to \r\nintegrate into the world economy. Assistance in \r\nbuilding adequate production capacities and \r\ncommercial infrastructure is, therefore, necessary and \r\nstrongly recommended. In Hungary’s view, the Aid for \r\nTrade initiative serves this very cause and, by granting \r\nresources to the developing countries, facilitates the \r\nadaptation process generated by liberalization. \r\n As a member of the European Union, we also \r\nhave strong commitments and obligations in the area of \r\ntrade liberalization. Together with other member \r\nStates, we are taking part in the initiative of increasing \r\nby €1 billion the volume of trade-related assistance \r\noffered to developing countries. In order to achieve this \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 28 \r\n \r\ntarget, Hungary intends to allocate a significant sum \r\nfrom our 2008 budget for development. I would like to \r\nconfirm that we are planning to apply this assistance in \r\ntwo forms: by donating to multilateral funds and by \r\nundertaking bilateral programmes. \r\n I also would like to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the report on the status of the achievement \r\nof the MDGs in 2007. The Millennium Development \r\nGoals Report 2007 stresses that a lot more has to be \r\ndone, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, \r\nHungary, along with other donor countries, will \r\nincrease its development focus on the least developed \r\ncountries of Africa. \r\n Finally, I wish to reiterate the role of international \r\ncooperation. Common responsibility and joint action \r\nare fundamental in order to reach our goals in the \r\ndeveloping world. I strongly hope that together we will \r\nsucceed. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Tjikero Tweya, Deputy \r\nMinister of Finance of Namibia. \r\n Mr. Tweya (Namibia): I am grateful for the \r\nopportunity to participate in this very important forum, \r\nwhich gives us the chance to assess, as well as to share \r\nwith one another, our experience. At the outset, \r\nNamibia wishes to put on record our support for the \r\nstatement delivered by the State Minister for Economic \r\nAffairs of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina. We appreciate the wonderful work of the \r\nSecretary-General in producing several comprehensive \r\nreports for this High-level Dialogue on the theme of \r\n“The Monterrey Consensus: status of implementation \r\nand tasks ahead”. \r\n During the International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, six main themes were identified: \r\nmobilization of domestic financial resources for \r\ndevelopment; mobilization of international resources \r\nfor development; international trade as an engine for \r\ndevelopment; increasing international financial and \r\ntechnical cooperation for development; external debt; \r\nand addressing systemic issues. \r\n With regard to the mobilization of domestic \r\nresources, Namibia has achieved macroeconomic \r\nstability characterized by, among other things, a \r\nrelatively low rate of inflation, which currently stands \r\nat 6.7 per cent. This has resulted in economic growth \r\nof 4.6 per cent in 2006, which, though commendable, \r\nis far short of the 7 per cent required for the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals by \r\n2015 and our own long-term national development \r\nplan, called Vision 2030. \r\n Furthermore, for the second consecutive year \r\nsince our independence in 1990, we were able to record \r\na surplus in the 2007-2008 fiscal year, following the \r\ntrend set by the 2006-2007 fiscal year. Our revenue \r\ncollection has also improved in recent years. These \r\npolicies, coupled with investment in infrastructure and \r\nsocial services, have also contributed significantly to \r\npoverty reduction. \r\n In our context, the poor are those who are unable \r\nto afford the minimum basic necessities of life, while \r\nthe extreme poor are those households that spend \r\n80 per cent or more of their income on food. These \r\nhave been reduced from 9 per cent in 1993 to 3.9 per \r\ncent in 2004, a reduction of about 55 per cent. The \r\nGovernment of Namibia has set itself the target of \r\nreducing extreme poverty by 2012, ahead of the \r\ndeadline for the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).  \r\n Foreign direct investment has been coming in \r\nvery slowly, despite deliberate policies that include \r\nfreedom for investors to repatriate their profits to their \r\ncountries of origin and a number of tax incentives. \r\nMoreover, the economic growth has been without a \r\ncommensurate rate of job creation.  \r\n On the question of international trade as an \r\nengine for development, as identified in Monterrey, \r\nNamibia has experienced some increase in trade in \r\nsome commodities, notably in minerals and \r\nagricultural products. However, we are still \r\nexperiencing a trade deficit whereby our exports are \r\nstill low compared to imports. Furthermore, we have \r\nyet to succeed in providing our experts with value \r\naddition and technological content. In that regard, the \r\nimpasse in the Doha Development Round of trade \r\nnegotiations and the accompanying insufficient funding \r\nand slow pace in implementation of the Aid for Trade \r\ninitiative have dampened our hopes of addressing \r\nsupply-side constraints much sooner. Trade-distorting \r\nagricultural subsidies by developed countries also \r\nmake it difficult for our products to compete in \r\ndeveloped markets. \r\n International financial and technical cooperation \r\nfor development has continued to decline steadily in \r\nmy country, from $110 per capita at independence in \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n29 07-55833 \r\n \r\n1990 to a mere $60 per capita in 2005. In addition, the \r\nnumber of bilateral development partners active in \r\nNamibia has declined, from 22 in 1990 to 17 in 2006, \r\nand there are indications that another three might be \r\nleaving the country during 2008. That continuous \r\ndecline in ODA may in the long run have negative \r\neffects on our efforts to fight poverty and to achieve \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n Limited capacity for service delivery is also one \r\nof the basic obstacles to economic growth and \r\ndevelopment in Namibia. Capacity-building \r\nrequirements encompass both human and institutional \r\nresources, including for research and development, and \r\nsystems in the area of enabling policies. In addition, \r\nthere is a mismatch in the labour market between \r\ndemand for and supply of labour, which is one of the \r\nmain reasons for rising unemployment in the country. \r\nIn an effort to address that mismatch, the Government \r\nhas launched the Education and Training Sector \r\nImprovement Programme, which is a strategic plan to \r\nincrease the service delivery in the education sector. \r\n The international community can support our \r\nefforts with financial and technical assistance to meet \r\nour human resource requirements. If we had the choice, \r\nwe would prefer budgetary support, as it offers \r\nflexibility in the allocation of resources and \r\npredictability of available resources. To that end, we \r\nnote with appreciation the recent positive \r\nannouncement by the Bretton Woods institutions that \r\nmechanisms would be put in place to address the \r\ndevelopment needs of middle-income developing \r\ncountries, such as my country. \r\n Namibia’s public debt remains relatively low and \r\nis expected to decline below the Government’s fiscal \r\ntarget of 25 per cent of GDP in the 2007-2008 fiscal \r\nyear. That is due to fiscal prudence, which has allowed \r\nus to live within our means. However, unless the \r\ninternational community comes up with a programme \r\nspecifically targeted at addressing the needs of middle-\r\nincome developing countries, the gains we have \r\nachieved so far may be reversed in the long run. \r\nInvestment in infrastructure and social services, which \r\nis a prerequisite for poverty reduction, requires \r\nsubstantial resources. In that regard, ODA and \r\nconcessional loans will significantly contribute to our \r\nefforts to avoid unsustainable debt. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that this Dialogue sets the \r\nstage for the review conference on the implementation \r\nof the Monterrey Consensus in Doha next year. We \r\nlook forward to that conference which in our view \r\nshould look into what has been achieved and needs to \r\nbe done to make improvements where there are \r\nshortcomings and, especially, should come up with a \r\ncommon understanding of what constitutes ODA in \r\norder to avoid any future misunderstanding. We do not \r\nthink that debt relief should be included in the concept \r\nof ODA. However, if it is included for any reason, then \r\nit should be accounted for separately. Debt relief does \r\nnot represent additional resource flows into developing \r\ncountries, even though it stems outflows. Another \r\nchallenge that the review conference should address is \r\nthe lack of implementation of the commitments made. \r\nMost of the commitments have hardly been translated \r\ninto concrete actions; that is a major challenge. \r\n The review conference should also deliberate on \r\nhow the international community could support the \r\ndevelopment efforts of middle-income developing \r\ncountries, whose needs have so far not been addressed \r\nwithin the context of the United Nations. The \r\nconference therefore should further assess why there \r\nhas been no significant upward movement within the \r\nranks of middle-income developing countries. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Cyril Chami, Deputy Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania. \r\n Mr. Chami (United Republic of Tanzania): As \r\nmay be recalled, the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development which took place in \r\nMexico in 2002 led to the adoption of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. Similarly, financing for development was \r\nonce again high on the agenda at the World Summit \r\nheld in Johannesburg in 2003. At each occasion, the \r\nHeads of State or Government reaffirmed the need for \r\nstrengthening partnerships for sustainable development \r\nwith a special emphasis on Africa. \r\n The outcome of the Summit of the Group of Eight \r\n(G8) held at Gleneagles in July 2005 was yet again a \r\nsignificant forum for review of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. The meeting focused on how to accelerate \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by 2015. Today, we are halfway there and the \r\nprogress in Africa has had mixed results. \r\n In tandem with those international milestones and \r\nother initiatives, Tanzania has taken various measures \r\nto implement its national and international obligations \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 30 \r\n \r\nby formulating and implementing policies and \r\nprogrammes. The National Vision 2025 for mainland \r\nTanzania and Vision 2020 for Zanzibar, both adopted \r\nbefore the Monterrey Consensus, aim at attaining \r\nimproved livelihood, peace, stability and national \r\nunity, good governance and a well-educated and \r\nlearned society committed to development. Those \r\nmeasures also set the direction for a competitive \r\neconomy capable of producing sustainable growth and \r\nshared benefits. \r\n The two visions anticipate Tanzania’s graduation \r\nfrom a least developed to a middle-income country, the \r\nelimination of abject poverty and the maintenance of a \r\nhigh economic growth rate of at least 8 per cent per \r\nannum. More recently, and consistent with the MDGs, \r\nthe National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of \r\nPoverty was created as a second national organizing \r\nframework to put the focus on poverty reduction high \r\non the country’s development agenda. It communicates \r\nthe visions and is aimed at achieving the MDGs of \r\ninternationally agreed targets by 2015. \r\n In tracking the implementation of the MDGs, \r\nTanzania was one of the first countries to produce an \r\nMDG document in 2001. The 2005 report had an \r\nencouraging story for many indicators. For instance, in \r\nprimary education enrolment we are ahead of schedule \r\nfor achieving the target. With respect to secondary and \r\nhigher education, we have witnessed a steady increase \r\nin secondary and tertiary institutions under public and \r\nprivate initiatives. Likewise, in gender parity in \r\neducation enrolment and political representation, there \r\nhas been significant progress. \r\n There are, however, areas of mixed results. For \r\ninstance, in health targets — HIV/AIDS and malaria — \r\nwe are still lagging behind. We also are not doing so \r\nwell with the maternal mortality rate, but we are \r\ndetermined to scale up interventions in that area. We \r\nare doing well in infant mortality rate and we are in the \r\nrange of meeting that MDG target by 2015. We are also \r\nmaking good progress in building health facilities \r\nacross the country and supplying clean water in rural \r\nareas. \r\n While we are working towards meeting our \r\ncommitments to the internationally agreed obligations \r\nof good governance, macroeconomic reforms and \r\nmobilization of domestic resources, challenges still \r\npersist. Those include, among others, inadequate \r\nenergy, poor education and health facilities, \r\nundeveloped physical and soft infrastructure and the \r\nmarauding HIV/AIDS pandemic. In order to meet the \r\nMDGs and other internationally agreed development \r\ngoal benchmarks by 2015, we need to put out more \r\nefforts in the remaining period. \r\n On the domestic front, we intend to increase \r\nmomentum in implementing our commitments to meet \r\nthe MDGs and the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals. For example, in our national budget this year we \r\nhave committed a substantial amount of the allocation \r\nof the national budget to education and the \r\ndevelopment of infrastructure with the intention of \r\nopening productive areas in the hinterlands, as well as \r\naddressing the systemic problems related to transport \r\nbottlenecks. We are grateful to our development \r\npartners and both the bilateral and multilateral donor \r\ncommunity for supporting our development objectives \r\nand for improving quality and directing assistance. The \r\nsupport will greatly contribute to the efforts in \r\naddressing the MDG targets. \r\n The implementation of ongoing economic \r\nreforms in the country has yielded substantial \r\neconomic growth as demonstrated by good \r\nmacroeconomic performance over the past five years, \r\nwhereby real GDP has been growing at an annual \r\naverage rate of 6 per cent, well above the sub-Saharan \r\naverage during the period. The achievements have been \r\ngrounded on a sound macroeconomic policy \r\nframework, institutionalization of regulatory \r\nframework, progress on structural reforms and \r\nsubstantial private sector involvement. \r\n Despite that progress, the issue of the \r\nunsustainable debt burden continues to be a serious \r\ndrawback to Tanzania’s development efforts despite \r\ndebt relief provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt \r\nRelief Initiative, as well as additional bilateral relief.  \r\n More negotiations are ongoing to further reduce \r\nthe debt burden. However, various studies show that \r\nthe debt obligation will never be met in the foreseeable \r\nfuture because of the technicalities involved. It is \r\nobvious that if the international community is serious \r\nabout reducing poverty, the solution for the least \r\ndeveloped countries — including Tanzania — is to \r\ncancel the overall multilateral debt in order to release \r\nthe resources for poverty reduction and development. \r\nFor their part, the developing countries should \r\naccelerate domestic resources mobilization. \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n31 07-55833 \r\n \r\n International trade is a tool for development and \r\nis directly linked to it. The Tanzanian economy is still \r\ndiversifying its exports in order to meet unfolding \r\nmarket opportunities. Those efforts are linked to the \r\nGovernment’s commitment to providing quality \r\neducation commensurate with the modern economy \r\nand infrastructure that supports economic activities. \r\nThe continuation of economic growth beyond 6 per \r\ncent and economic diversification will provide impetus \r\nto growth in our exports. On international trade \r\npractices, we need to conclude the World Trade \r\nOrganization negotiations in order to address the \r\nexisting constraints of market access which affect us. \r\n Let me conclude by stating that the issues of \r\nfinancing for development need new impetus now and \r\nnot later, in order to resuscitate the good intentions of \r\nMonterrey.  \r\n My delegation and I are optimistic that the \r\ndeliberations of this high-level meeting will send the \r\nright signals to the forthcoming Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha. We hope \r\nthat the Conference will provide a valuable opportunity \r\nto make progress towards an agreement on a \r\ncomprehensive and effective approach to meet the \r\nresource requirements for the development of \r\ndeveloping countries.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Park In-kook, Deputy Minister for \r\nInternational Organizations and Global Issues of the \r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Park In-Kook (Republic of Korea): This \r\nmeeting comes at a moment when international \r\npolitical and economic conditions have never been \r\nmore favourable for the international community’s \r\nachievement of our development goals. Despite some \r\nevident vulnerability, the continued growth of the \r\nworld economy, based on a relatively stable financial \r\nsector and low inflation, provides a unique opportunity \r\nto launch reforms in the area of financing for \r\ndevelopment on the basis of a long-term vision. \r\n As the report of the Secretary-General (A/62/190) \r\nclearly points out, there are concerns that the fruits are \r\nnot fairly distributed in the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. Selective allocation of aid \r\nexcludes many low-income countries, despite their \r\nurgent need. I hope that at this meeting we will further \r\nthe discussion on how to reduce the number of \r\ndeveloping countries that are shut out of international \r\naid. \r\n Needless to say, the international community has \r\nmade strenuous efforts towards strengthening its \r\ncommitment to eradicate poverty and disease. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) increased from \r\n$53 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion last year. \r\nSignificant progress has been made in various sectors \r\nbut, with the exception of some countries in the Asian \r\nregion, we have not been very successful in alleviating \r\nextreme poverty in countries where it is most rife. With \r\nthe upcoming Doha summit in 2008, we need an \r\nextraordinary jumpstart to accelerate progress. \r\n There are clear signs of hope that we can achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). One is \r\nthe remarkable increase in the number of donor \r\ncountries. Seven years ago, the traditional donor \r\ncountries represented by the Development Assistance \r\nCommittee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) were the \r\nworld’s only donors. Now, a number of other countries \r\nwith strong economies are scaling up their ODA, \r\nincluding the Republic of Korea, as well as Brazil, \r\nRussia, India and China — the so-called BRIC States \r\n— and other non-DAC OECD countries. \r\n In an effort to build effective partnerships among \r\ntraditional and newly emerging donors, the Republic of \r\nKorea, together with the OECD, held a conference in \r\nSeoul just last month with non-DAC OECD donor \r\ncountries. There were productive consultations on \r\nenhancing cooperation and aid effectiveness. Emerging \r\ndonors, whose political and economic influence has \r\nbeen growing steadily in recent years, are encouraged \r\nto play a more noticeable role in meeting the aid \r\nrequirements necessary to reach the MDG targets. \r\n Another important factor vis-à-vis those \r\nemerging donors is that they themselves were once \r\nrecipient countries. Having gone through the \r\ndevelopment process, they can provide practical advice \r\nand guidelines, sharing the lessons they have learned \r\nwith today’s recipient countries. \r\n As an emerging donor that will be joining DAC \r\nby 2010, the Republic of Korea has on many occasions \r\ndeclared its strong commitment to faithfully implement \r\nthe principles set out in the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nto make an even greater contribution at the \r\ninternational level. To that end, we are planning to \r\nA/62/PV.32  \r\n \r\n07-55833 32 \r\n \r\nexpand our ODA to $1 billion by 2009, and to \r\n$3.2 billion by 2015. \r\n To complement our aid resources and further \r\nsupport international efforts to eradicate poverty, we \r\nhave also joined the air-ticket solidarity levy initiative, \r\nan innovative source of financing for development. It is \r\nhighly auspicious that innovative financing for \r\ndevelopment is emerging so rapidly as a major issue on \r\nthe international agenda. To support such innovation, \r\nthe Republic of Korea, last September in Seoul, hosted \r\nthe Third Plenary Meeting of the Leading Group on \r\nSolidarity Levies to Fund Development. \r\n The first element of the Monterey Consensus \r\nemphasizes mobilizing domestic financial resources. \r\nThat clearly underlines the key role of enhancing the \r\nfinancial capacity of developing countries through \r\nnational savings campaigns, investment and \r\nconcentration of capital, especially in view of the \r\nimportance of achieving sustainable development \r\nbased on ownership. Korea’s development experience \r\nduring the past five decades confirms the importance \r\nof those concepts. However, our development history \r\nalso reveals that domestic efforts are not enough. Such \r\nendeavours must be augmented by foreign direct \r\ninvestment and other private capital flows for the \r\ndevelopment of key infrastructure. \r\n Given the diversity of economic growth among \r\nand within developing countries, there can be no \r\none-size-fits-all development strategy. Tailored \r\napproaches to development can be used to establish \r\nnational development strategies for developing \r\ncountries that reflect the unique indigenous \r\ncharacteristics of their development.  \r\n The case of the Republic of Korea shows that \r\ndeveloping countries should carefully formulate their \r\nplans and policies according to their respective levels \r\nof development and retain the ability to create the most \r\nappropriate development strategies by referring to \r\nproven best practices. \r\n To maximize the efficiency of international \r\nresources, recipients need to establish appropriate \r\nfinancial regulations and mechanisms to facilitate \r\nstable capital flows, aligning them with broader \r\nlong-term objectives for sustainable development. For \r\nits part, Korea has in place policies to facilitate such \r\ncapital transfers through the reduction of transmission \r\ncosts and the liberation of overseas remittances — \r\nwhile our foreign direct investment in developing \r\ncountries reached $5.2 billion in 2006. \r\n I believe that the third method of financing put \r\nforward by the Monterrey Consensus — international \r\ntrade as an engine for development — was at the core \r\nof Korea’s success story. With financial resources and \r\nadvanced technology attained through trade, Korea was \r\nnot only able to accumulate the necessary foreign \r\ncapital but also to invest massively in mid-to-long-term \r\ndevelopment plans. Based on its unique experience, \r\nKorea is assisting developing countries to build \r\ncapacity in the area of trade by increasing the benefits \r\nof non-tariff trade, aid-for-trade and other trade-related \r\ntechnical cooperation. \r\n Four decades following the Korean War, the \r\nRepublic of Korea is now a developed country that \r\nonce was a major recipient country, receiving \r\n$13 billion in aid. Our case shows that international \r\nassistance can serve as an indispensable engine for \r\ndevelopment and growth by creating a virtuous cycle in \r\nthe development process. Korea now stands ready to \r\ncontribute to international efforts to meet the MDGs by \r\nenhancing partnerships with both recipient and donor \r\ncountries. We firmly believe that effective partnerships \r\namong donors and recipients can be established \r\nthrough the ownership of development plans, along \r\nwith sound policies and good governance. \r\n The Republic of Korea focuses not only on \r\nincreasing the volume of its aid, but also on improving \r\nits effectiveness. In establishing and carrying our aid \r\npolicy, we have lunched the mid-term Government \r\nmanagement plan as an effort to increase the volume of \r\naid every five years, to develop policies to expand \r\nconsiderably the rate of untied aid and to enhance the \r\nproportion of grants in the disbursement of our aid.  \r\n At the halfway point to the deadline for meeting \r\nthe MDGs, it is high time for us take stock of our \r\nachievements to date and to pool our wisdom to set the \r\nfuture direction for concrete action. It is my sincere \r\nhope that this meeting will yield productive and \r\ntangible outcomes, paving the way towards the success \r\nof the 2008 Doha Conference. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m. \r\n"
