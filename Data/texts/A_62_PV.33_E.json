(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 53 (continued) \r\n \r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment \r\n \r\n (b) High-level dialogue for the implementation of \r\nthe outcome of the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/62/190 and \r\nA/62/217) \r\n  \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/271) \r\n \r\n  Summary by the President of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council (A/62/76-E/2007/155 and \r\nA/62/76/Corr.1-E/2007/155/Corr.1) \r\n \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. James Mulungushi, Permanent Secretary of the \r\nMinistry of Finance and National Planning of Zambia. \r\n Mr. Mulungushi (Zambia): Zambia would like to \r\njoin previous speakers in complimenting you, Sir, for \r\nconvening this High-level Dialogue as we prepare for \r\nthe review of the implementation of the Monterey \r\nConsensus. We also wish to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report contained in document A/62/217. \r\n Zambia fully aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Pakistan on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, and of Bangladesh on \r\nbehalf of the least developed countries. \r\n We may recall that the Monterrey Consensus on \r\nfinancing for development offered a lot of hope to the \r\ndeveloping world for its integration into the global \r\neconomy. Indeed, some developing countries have \r\nexhibited positive economic growth, though the \r\nmajority are far from being integrated and will not \r\nachieve most of the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n Zambia, like many other developing countries, is \r\ncommitted to the implementation of the decisions \r\nagreed upon in the Monterrey Consensus and calls \r\nupon all the other parties to honour their pledges. In \r\nthat regard, Zambia has made considerable progress in \r\nthe implementation of the Monterrey Consensus agreed \r\nupon in 2002. Conditions for mobilizing both domestic \r\nand external financial resources have been achieved, as \r\nevidenced by the improved and sustained \r\nmacroeconomic environment of the past five years. \r\nReal gross domestic product (GDP), which is a key \r\nstimulus for expanding fiscal space, has been growing \r\nat an average of over 5 per cent over the past five \r\nyears. On the other hand, inflation has been declining, \r\nreaching single digits in 2006 for the first time in \r\n30 years. Interest rates have also enabled increased \r\nprivate sector credit, which grew by 54.7 per cent in \r\n2006. Banks have been diversifying their range of \r\nproducts and branches. Domestic revenues as a \r\npercentage of GDP have been stabilized at around \r\n18 per cent. The foreign exchange rate of the kwacha \r\nagainst major currencies has also been stable. That \r\nmacroeconomic stability has resulted in increased \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 2 \r\n \r\nforeign direct investment in recent years, especially in \r\nthe mining sector. In 2006, for example, foreign direct \r\ninvestment was around $400 million. \r\n Furthermore, external sector performance has \r\nbeen good, as evidenced by a sustained increase in \r\nexports in the past five years and improvement in gross \r\ninternational reserves. Growth in non-traditional \r\nexports over the past five years has been over 25 per \r\ncent. Similarly, metal exports in the past five years \r\nhave increased due to high copper prices on the \r\ninternational market. The external debt overhang has \r\ndeclined significantly and now stands at around \r\n$700 million, thereby providing the much-needed \r\nfiscal space for the implementation of development \r\nprogrammes. Zambia therefore appreciates the debt \r\nrelief provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries Debt Initiative and the Multilateral Debt \r\nRelief Initiative. \r\n Within the harmonization strategy contained in its \r\nfifth national development plan, progress has been \r\nmade in harmonizing donor practices so as to improve \r\naid effectiveness in line with the Paris Declaration. The \r\nJoint Assistance Strategy for Zambia, which defines \r\nZambia’s development framework with cooperating \r\npartners, has been developed. In addition, a number of \r\ncooperating partners have signed a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding on poverty reduction budget support in \r\nan effort to reduce transaction costs and improve \r\npredictability of external resources. \r\n In order to drive the development process, \r\nZambia has prepared a fully-owned fifth national \r\ndevelopment plan for the period 2006-2010, the theme \r\nof which emphasizes infrastructure development, \r\ncapacity-building, technological advancement and \r\nwealth creation. That also includes investment in \r\nhealth and education. \r\n We are hopeful that, going ahead, the country is \r\npoised for further growth. That optimism is premised \r\non continued strong improvements in macroeconomic \r\nperformance and progress in public expenditure \r\nmanagement, in line with the fifth national \r\ndevelopment plan. Specifically, the focus in the coming \r\nyears will be on, first, the efficient use of the fiscal \r\nspace that has been created as a result of debt relief and \r\nsustained GDP growth; secondly, improving domestic \r\nresource collection; and thirdly, deepening structural \r\nreforms, especially those that will increase domestic \r\nand foreign investment, facilitate trade and improve \r\nproductivity. Some of the reforms that Zambia is \r\nimplementing in that regard are the Public Expenditure \r\nManagement and Accountability, the Private Sector \r\nDevelopment Programme and the Millennium \r\nChallenge Account Threshold Programme. \r\n Though Zambia is experiencing growth, there is a \r\ndownside to this positive story. That is due to the fact \r\nthat poverty levels remain high and were estimated at \r\n68 per cent in 2004, down from 73 per cent in 1998. \r\nSustained growth is still fragile, since the economy is \r\nlargely dependent on the mining sector and rain-fed \r\nagriculture, coupled with inadequate economic \r\ninfrastructure. In the social sectors of education and \r\nhealth, critical shortages of teachers, nurses and \r\ndoctors have adversely affected service delivery. The \r\nimpact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic also remains a \r\nchallenge, adding further pressure on health care \r\ndelivery. \r\n Therefore Zambia like many other developing \r\ncountries, needs a lot of assistance from the \r\ninternational community and calls for concerted efforts \r\nin order for our countries to be integrated into the \r\nglobal economy. The following areas, among others, \r\nshould be addressed in order to overcome some of the \r\nchallenges that we face in Zambia: the scaling-up of \r\naid to Africa, in line with the agreed commitments, so \r\nthat development programmes can be intensified; \r\nrealigning development assistance with recipient \r\ncountries’ national development strategies; concluding \r\nthe Doha Round of negotiations, which is expected to \r\ndeal with the interests and needs of Africa; financing \r\nthe infrastructure gap in Africa by, among other things, \r\nimproving the structure of private-public partnerships, \r\nincluding by building capacity in the public sector to \r\ndeal with such partnerships; increasing the voice and \r\nparticipation of developing countries in the \r\ninternational financial institutions and other institutions \r\nat the global level; and financing the negative impacts \r\nof climate change in least developed countries, which \r\nare highly vulnerable to those effects because of their \r\ndependence on rain-fed agriculture. \r\n The President: I call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Gyan Chandra Acharya, Foreign Secretary, \r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal. \r\n Mr. Acharya (Nepal): Let me begin by \r\nappreciating the comprehensive reports of the \r\nSecretary-General on the status of financing for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n3 07-56101 \r\n \r\n I wish to associate myself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Pakistan on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n Since the international community has expressed \r\nits firm commitment to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), financing for \r\ndevelopment and attaining sustainable development, \r\nthe development agenda has occupied centre stage at \r\nthe United Nations. But there have been mixed results \r\nin development since those compacts were agreed. \r\nWhile some developing countries have made good \r\nprogress, many, particularly least developing countries \r\n(LDCs), are lagging behind in their development. Their \r\ndevelopment is severely constrained by the lack of \r\nsustainable financing, both domestically and \r\ninternationally. \r\n With the Monterrey Consensus in 2002, the \r\ninternational community demonstrated its commitment \r\nto fulfilling the needs of the developing countries by \r\ninvesting in synergy and ensuring adequate and \r\nsustained financial resources for their development. We \r\nagree with the report of the Secretary-General that we \r\nhave made only modest progress and that the \r\nimplementation of those commitments and pledges is \r\nrather slow. We face the challenges of promoting rapid \r\nand sustainable growth in many countries. The benefits \r\nof development are yet to be distributed fairly. \r\n The delegation of Nepal stresses that the Doha \r\nConference should be utilized as an opportunity to \r\nlearn from our experiences, take stock of the progress \r\nmade, seek innovative sources of financing, and \r\naccelerate the implementation of commitments so as to \r\nensure the achievement of the MDGs and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. \r\n The LDCs are still in the classical stage of \r\nunderdevelopment, where they seriously lack capital \r\nformation and technological advancement. They find \r\nthemselves in the vicious trap of a low level of \r\nequilibrium. That is further compounded by a low level \r\nof productivity and a paucity of physical and \r\ntechnological infrastructure. Together, a large majority \r\nof them continue to find themselves at the bottom of \r\nthe development ladder, despite revolutionary changes \r\nin science and technology and the unprecedented level \r\nof globalization. The downside of globalization has \r\nbeen more prominent in those countries because of \r\ntheir high level of economic vulnerability. That, we \r\nbelieve, is a fundamental challenge to the global \r\ncommunity. We must collectively deal with it in a spirit \r\nof partnership.  \r\n We are all aware that domestic efforts and \r\ndomestic financing are crucial to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of any country, but we strongly feel that a \r\nhigh and sustained level of external financing will be \r\nequally indispensable for getting swiftly out from \r\nunder the crushing burden of poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. We have been made starkly aware \r\nby the current realities of the world; the continuation of \r\nsuch a situation is not sustainable and is a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. We cannot indefinitely \r\nhave islands of abundance and opulence in a sea of \r\ndeprivation and marginalization. \r\n Innovative ways and mechanisms must be \r\nexplored and broadened to bolster development \r\ncollaboration. My delegation stresses the need for an \r\ninclusive and equitable international economic and \r\ndevelopment framework that is responsive to the needs \r\nand concerns of the larger section of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n As we are halfway towards achieving the MDGs, \r\nit has become clear that many targets will be difficult \r\nto meet, especially in the least developed countries. \r\nWhile securing the gains that we have made in some \r\nareas, we need coherent and focused attention on \r\neffectively mobilizing domestic and international \r\nresources for strengthening our capacity to achieve \r\nthose goals, in which we lag behind.  \r\n It is a matter of concern that the unsustainable \r\ndebt burden has had a negative impact on sustained \r\ngrowth in many poor countries. Finding a durable \r\nsolution to debt problems and increasing additional \r\nresources for development should be the priorities of \r\nthe international community. We are alarmed at the \r\nreduction in real terms of total development assistance, \r\nwhich was highlighted yesterday by the representatives \r\nof the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund \r\nand the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment, as well as by many delegations. When \r\nwe talk about financing for development, we need to \r\nfocus on scaling up development aid. Predictability and \r\naccessibility, moreover, are the keys to development. \r\n We call for the full implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the LDCs. While we \r\nthank those development partners that have met the \r\ntargets, we urge the developed countries to make real \r\ncontributions by meeting the official development \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 4 \r\n \r\nassistance target of 0.2 per cent of gross national \r\nincome to the LDCs. \r\n Similarly, we need a holistic approach to deal \r\nwith the myriad problems faced by the LDCs. When \r\nwe all agree that trade could be an engine of growth, \r\nwe must ensure the development dimension of the \r\nDoha Round of talks by enhancing the level of \r\neffective market access for their products, the removal \r\nof barriers to trade, productive capacity-development \r\nthrough the effective operationalization of the Aid for \r\nTrade Initiative, and the augmentation and swift \r\ndisbursement of resources for the Integrated \r\nFramework programme of support for the LDCs. \r\nWithout concerted efforts to mitigate the impact of \r\nglobal liberalization, there is a clear danger of mass \r\nunemployment and de-industrialization, especially in \r\nthe least developed countries. \r\n We hardly need to emphasize the role of \r\ninternational financial institutions, particularly the \r\nBretton Woods institutions, in financing for \r\ndevelopment. Those institutions should develop \r\ncoherent, consistent and concerted efforts to support \r\nthe implementation of national development strategies, \r\nwith the meaningful participation of developing and \r\nthe least developed countries in the decision-making \r\nprocess of development cooperation. \r\n In conclusion, sustainable financing for \r\ndevelopment is attainable if we act in concert and with \r\nseriousness and sincerity. Today’s world has an \r\nabundance of resources, technology and knowledge \r\nthat can easily meet the development needs of all \r\ncountries. It is only a matter of synchronizing the \r\nrequirements and availability. There is a need for a \r\ncomprehensive and consolidated approach. Investment \r\nin the development of the world’s poorest countries \r\nshould be viewed as an investment in the long-term \r\npeace and security of the entire world. We look \r\nforward to a meaningful outcome of the Doha \r\nConference in achieving a comprehensive and \r\nconcerted strategy, together with a mechanism to \r\nreview the commitment to the financing for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Axel Poniatowski, Chairman of the National \r\nAssembly Foreign Affairs Committee of France. \r\n Mr. Poniatowski (France) (spoke in French): It is \r\na great honour for me to have the opportunity to \r\nconvey the French authorities’ conviction of the \r\nimportance of the High-level Dialogue on Financing \r\nfor Development. \r\n As the representative of Portugal stressed, \r\nspeaking on behalf of the European Union, the \r\nMonterrey Consensus is the foundation of the global \r\npartnership for development. Its principal \r\ncharacteristics are a balance between reciprocal \r\ncommitments, openness to all parties, and a willingness \r\nto go beyond divisions through a shared political \r\nresolve. \r\n For some years now, globalization has been of \r\nconcern to the developed countries and has forced them \r\nto question themselves. It has also raised hundreds of \r\nmillions of the poorest people out of poverty and \r\npromoted an exceptional period of growth. At the same \r\ntime, it has revealed certain imbalances and \r\ndysfunction, of which the tensions on the financial \r\nmarkets are a recent illustration. Moreover, many \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, have the \r\nreasonable sense of being subjected to globalization \r\nand excluded from its benefits. We must therefore \r\nrespond to their concerns. \r\n The long road to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals justifies an \r\nunprecedented effort to honour the commitments we \r\nmade at the major international conferences. That is \r\nwhy France is ready to support ail initiatives that will \r\nenhance the mobilization of the international \r\ncommunity on behalf of those goals. \r\n It is also up to us to keep our word. The States \r\nmembers of the European Union have demonstrated \r\ntheir resolve to make every effort to devote 0.7 per cent \r\nof their gross national income by 2015 to official \r\ndevelopment assistance. President Nicolas Sarkozy has \r\ncommitted himself, and France will therefore keep its \r\npromises. As with the launching of the International \r\nDrug Purchase Facility here in 2006, France will \r\ncontinue to campaign for innovative financing for \r\ndevelopment, which is an indispensable complement to \r\nofficial assistance and reflects a new form of \r\ninternational solidarity epitomized by the contribution \r\non airline tickets, which some 30 countries have \r\npledged to introduce.  \r\n We must now keep to our commitments. \r\nAccordingly, we hope that the Doha Conference will \r\nencourage the emergence of a consensus and lead to \r\nnew progress towards the mechanisms that the \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n5 07-56101 \r\n \r\ninternational community needs to meet the major \r\nchallenges of health and climate.  \r\n Development is not just a matter of financing. It \r\npartakes of a shared responsibility requiring universal \r\nresolve in the context of a global partnership based on \r\nsolidarity. Accordingly, it is up to the developing \r\ncountries to act to end the infernal cycle of violence \r\nand ensure peace; to fight against the arbitrary, the \r\nfrightening trafficking of drugs and corruption; and to \r\ncreate the conditions in which the energies of the \r\nprivate sector will be released. Likewise, the North-\r\nSouth partnership requires the link between migration \r\nand development to be taken into account based on an \r\napproach of common interests in which \r\nco-development has a place. Many countries have \r\nbegun bold reforms in all those areas. I should like, on \r\nFrance’s behalf, to pay tribute to them and to \r\nemphasize that their choices are all the more justified \r\nin that they respond first to the profound aspirations of \r\ntheir peoples. \r\n Furthermore, the quality and effectiveness of \r\nassistance must become a reflex worthy of the goals of \r\ndevelopment. The Paris Declaration has no other \r\nobjective than to translate into action the national \r\nappropriation of that idea, without which it is \r\nimpossible to set the virtuous circle of development in \r\nmotion. It is important that all donors, including the \r\nactors involved in South-South cooperation, apply its \r\ndiscipline.  \r\n It is naturally up to the United Nations to do its \r\nshare of the effort. Almost a year ago, the High-level \r\nPanel on United Nations System-wide Coherence \r\npresented a series of proposals to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of the Organization’s operational \r\nactivities. Eight countries decided, in complete \r\nsovereignty, to experiment with the “united in action” \r\nconcept, the main objective of which is to restore to the \r\nrecipients of aid the power to decide their own \r\npriorities and to define with them the contribution \r\nexpected from the United Nations system. \r\n The success of that reform, which is in the \r\ninterest of countries that depend on international aid \r\nfor their development, is a test of the United Nations \r\ncredibility. With the leadership of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the mobilization of the entire system, it is \r\nour responsibility to provide intergovernmental support \r\nfor common-sense measures. \r\n The developing countries feel especially excluded \r\nfrom the benefits of globalization because their ability \r\nto make their voices heard in international bodies is \r\ninadequate. Accordingly, France resolutely supports \r\nindispensable reforms at the Bretton Woods institutions \r\nto make them more effective, better integrate them into \r\ncollective international action, and have them take \r\naccount of the legitimate aspirations of countries \r\ndesiring to assume their responsibilities and duties. The \r\nnew Director General of the International Monetary \r\nFund will shortly be taking up the new duties that have \r\nbeen conferred on him in the wake of his message on \r\nreforms.  \r\n Lastly, France, through its President Nicolas \r\nSarkozy, recently proposed that the G-8 continue its \r\ngradual transformation and ultimately evolve into a \r\nG13 so that closer cooperation can be implemented \r\nbetween the major emerging countries and the most \r\nindustrialized. In that regard, the process of dialogue \r\nlaunched by Germany at Heiligendamm, which will \r\ndeal specifically with development assistance, will be \r\nan important step. \r\n It is clear that the task before us all is immense. \r\nThe importance of what is at stake — the promotion of \r\na more equitable international order with greater \r\nsolidarity — justifies a high degree of ambition. The \r\nMonterrey Consensus remains as relevant as ever. It is \r\nup to us to see to it that the Doha Conference builds \r\nmomentum for achieving the objectives that we \r\ncollectively set and that are still current today. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nThe Honourable Mr. Loh Seng Kok, Member of the \r\nParliament of Malaysia. \r\n Mr. Loh (Malaysia): I would first like to thank \r\nyou, Sir, for convening this meeting. I would also like \r\nto thank the Permanent Representatives of Egypt and \r\nNorway for their excellent work as the co-facilitators \r\nof this process and the Secretary-General for his \r\nreports. I would also at this stage like to associate \r\nmyself with the statement made by the representative \r\nof Pakistan on behalf of the G77 and China. \r\n This Dialogue is a valuable opportunity for us not \r\nonly to take stock of the present situation relating to \r\nfinancing for development, but also to find ways to \r\ngenerate momentum on the subject as we approach the \r\nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus in Doha next year. In that \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 6 \r\n \r\nconnection, the theme for this High-level Dialogue — \r\n“The Monterrey Consensus: status of implementation \r\nand tasks ahead” — is both timely and appropriate. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report clearly indicates \r\nthat progress is slow in most, if not all areas of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. But progress is slowest in \r\nperhaps the most important area of them all, the \r\nprovision of official development assistance (ODA). \r\n The worth of each civilization is measured by \r\nhow it treats its weakest and most vulnerable members. \r\nIn the present context, we must be measured by our \r\nactions to help those in the poorest countries. In \r\npractical terms, this means the level of financial \r\nassistance given. Using this measure, it is clear that we \r\nhave failed the test of civilized behaviour, particularly \r\nwhen we compare the resources that we possess with \r\nwhat is required to lift the poor out of their plight. \r\n If we are indeed to be thankful for small mercies, \r\nwe should be gratified that compared with 2002, when \r\nODA levels stood at 0.2 per cent, the figure rose to \r\n0.33 per cent in 2005, when it stood at $106.5 billion. \r\nUnfortunately, however, we now know that much of \r\nthe increase is accounted for by debt relief and \r\ntechnical and emergency assistance. Compounding the \r\nissue is the fact that the figure dropped to 0.3 per cent \r\nlast year. \r\n There is a need to put the whole issue of the \r\nquantum of ODA in perspective. I would therefore like \r\nto juxtapose the $106.5 billion given as ODA in 2005 \r\nwith other figures, by way of comparison. First of all, \r\nthe Millennium Project estimates that at least \r\n$150 billion is required annually if the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) are to be achieved. As \r\nmatters stand, it is unlikely that the MDGs will be \r\nrealized, due in part to lack of financing. Secondly, in \r\n2005, the net outward financial flows from the \r\ndeveloping to the developed world totalled \r\n$533 billion. Thirdly, total global military spending \r\nduring that year stood at $1.118 trillion, or 2.5 per cent \r\nof global gross domestic product — or $173 for each \r\ninhabitant of the world. The United States alone \r\naccounted for 48 per cent of military spending. \r\n More important, discussions should not be \r\nconfined to ODA alone. It is important to recall that the \r\nMonterrey Consensus embraced six areas in all, which \r\nincluded all of the issues related to financing and its \r\nrelationship to development. Malaysia believes that the \r\n2008 Review Conference must fundamentally assess \r\nand recommend measures related to the following \r\nissues. First of all, we need to understand the reasons \r\nfor the non-implementation of the goals of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, particularly in fulfilling ODA \r\ntargets. We believe that the establishment of a \r\nmonitoring mechanism to assess the level of ODA \r\nprovided by the developed world will give impetus to \r\nthese efforts. We note that this issue has been raised by \r\nthe Group of 77 before and has failed to find \r\nconsensus. However, given the urgency of the \r\nsituation, we believe that further discussions on this are \r\nwarranted. In essence, what is required is for these \r\nissues, which are currently being discussed in the \r\nDevelopment Assistance Committee (DAC) of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD), to now also be taken up in the \r\nUnited Nations, perhaps by the Annual Ministerial \r\nReview or the Development Cooperation Forum of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council.  \r\n Secondly, the increasingly complex interlinkage \r\nbetween finance and various new and emerging aspects \r\nof development must be examined. For example, if \r\nclimate change is to be one of the main factors \r\nimpacting development efforts in the future, it is \r\nessential that the Review Conference devote its \r\nattention to some of the key issues of this subject. One \r\ncould usefully discuss international assistance to \r\naddress not only adaptation issues, but also climate-\r\nrelated reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts.  \r\n Finally, in terms of new and innovative sources of \r\nfinancing for development, there is a need to evaluate \r\nvarious initiatives that have been launched during the \r\npast few years, and to use them as a basis for newer \r\nones.  \r\n Having said this, it is essential to note, that given \r\nthe wealth it possesses, the burden of responsibility for \r\nstrengthening international efforts at financing for \r\ndevelopment must fall on the developed world. It must \r\nnot be passed on to the so-called emerging donor \r\nnations — which is itself a vague and ambiguous term. \r\nIn this connection, we believe that to the extent that the \r\nterm is used, it should be confined to the non-DAC \r\nmembers of the OECD only. \r\n That being said, Malaysia has not shied — and \r\nwill not shy — away from our responsibilities to assist \r\nother developing countries. Within the context of \r\nSouth-South cooperation, our Malaysian Technical \r\nCooperation Programme is a vehicle for sharing our \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n7 07-56101 \r\n \r\ndevelopment experience, especially that gathered in \r\nspecific areas in which we have strengths and \r\nexperience. To date, 137 countries are beneficiaries of \r\nthe Programme, compared to 46 in 1991. This \r\ndemonstrates increased demand from Programme \r\ncountries as well as Malaysia’s greater willingness to \r\nassist. \r\n Mr. Romero-Martínez (Honduras), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to affirm Malaysia’s \r\nfull support for the objectives of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. We therefore commit ourselves to working \r\nwith the President of the General Assembly and with \r\nother delegations in ensuring that the Review \r\nConference is a success. We would define success as \r\nhaving made strides in constructing an international \r\nfinancial structure that works for, not against, the \r\ndevelopmental aspirations of the poorest. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Santosh Bagrobia, \r\nMember of Parliament, of India. \r\n Mr. Bagrobia (India): We welcome this \r\nopportunity to participate in the High-level Dialogue of \r\nthe General Assembly on Financing for Development. \r\nThis meeting is particularly opportune in the light of \r\nthe Follow-up International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha in 2008. \r\n Effective implementation of the commitments \r\nundertaken at Monterrey remains the weakest link, \r\nwith commitments not being transformed into concrete \r\naction. This is particularly true of action with regard to \r\nsystemic issues, which underpins progress in all other \r\nareas of the Monterrey Consensus. Real progress in \r\nimplementing the Consensus has to involve a \r\nfundamental and comprehensive reform of the \r\ninternational financial and monetary architecture in \r\norder to address its democratic deficit, enhancing the \r\nvoice and participation of developing countries in \r\ndecision-making and norm-setting. Only then can we \r\nensure a more conducive environment for addressing \r\nthe challenges of financing for development. While a \r\nfew steps have been taken, much more remains to be \r\ndone. \r\n Ensuring enhanced and predictable financial \r\nresource flows for developing countries in order to \r\nassist them in pursuing their development agenda is at \r\nthe core of the Monterrey Consensus. Unfortunately, \r\nprogress towards this basic objective has been limited. \r\nThere is a clear recognition of the huge gap that exists \r\nbetween the resources required by developing countries \r\nto achieve internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nand the projected resource flows. This is compounded \r\nby the fact that actual resources flows are far less than \r\ncommitments undertaken. \r\n A case in point is official development assistance \r\n(ODA). While there has been an increase in private \r\nflows to some developing countries, the importance of \r\nand need for ODA cannot be overemphasized. Private \r\nsector inflows do not effectively reach social sectors or \r\narchitecture projects and cannot eliminate the need for \r\nODA or for the involvement of public sector \r\ninvestment. The impact of private flows on \r\nemployment generation, which is recognized as an \r\nindispensable element of domestic resource \r\nmobilization, has also been marginal in many cases.  \r\n The Monterrey Consensus explicitly recognizes \r\nthe role of the State, and of public investment, in socio-\r\neconomic development. Last year’s drop in ODA and \r\nprojections of negative trends in future ODA flows are \r\ntherefore matters of grave concern. It is estimated that \r\nODA will taper off in 2007, and will not exceed \r\n0.36 per cent by 2010. We believe that there is a need \r\nfor a more robust and efficient monitoring mechanism \r\nto track ODA flows and the implementation of Goal 8 \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n The continuing and increasing flow of financial \r\nresources from developing countries to developed \r\ncountries is another concern that we have been unable \r\nto address collectively. Furthermore, counting as aid \r\ndebt relief that does not lead to freeing up resources for \r\ndevelopment on account of debt arrears is another flaw \r\nin the current system. We hope that the Development \r\nCooperation Forum of the strengthened Economic and \r\nSocial Council will take the lead in examining these \r\nimportant issues, including by undertaking a periodic \r\nreview of the policies of the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. \r\n Enhancing trade is a crucial component in \r\nensuring the sustainability of development. Developing \r\ncountries still face severe market access restrictions. \r\nWe reiterate the need for early and substantive progress \r\nat the Doha Round of trade negotiations, based on the \r\nprimacy of the development dimension. It is illogical to \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 8 \r\n \r\nlink the interests of subsistence farmers in developing \r\ncountries with subsidized and trade-distorting \r\nagricultural practices in many developed countries, or \r\nwith the issue of non-agricultural market access.  \r\n The overarching principles of less than full \r\nreciprocity and special and differential treatment \r\nremain categorical imperatives. In terms of putting \r\nthese into practice, I am happy to reiterate that by the \r\nend of 2007, imports from least developed countries \r\ninto India will face a zero-tariff regime. \r\n Reforms of the international financial \r\narchitecture should encompass trade financing, so that \r\nexport-credit agencies and multilateral development \r\nbanks act in a counter-cyclical manner. We also need \r\nboth to stimulate new and innovative sources of \r\nfinancing and to ensure that they do not weaken the \r\nresolve of developed countries to meet their ODA \r\ntargets and do not crowd out other forms of financing. \r\n Despite the progress made by a few countries, the \r\nissue of external debt continues to pose significant \r\nchallenges to developing countries, in particular to \r\nlow-income and least developed countries. Hopes for \r\nreleasing additional resources for development through \r\ndebt cancellation have been realized only marginally, \r\nas many countries have debt arrears. The pace of debt \r\nrelief initiatives has also been very slow, and the \r\nimpact of past debt-constrained structural adjustment \r\npolicies has not been overcome.  \r\n Moreover, debt relief measures have not \r\nholistically addressed underlying problems — covering \r\nthe range of issues from the need for greater policy \r\nspace towards inclusive economic growth, better terms \r\nof trade and greater access to markets and investment \r\nflows. We believe that new measures for debt \r\nrestructuring and mechanisms such as an international \r\ndebt commission overseen by the United Nations \r\nthrough the Economic and Social Council are required \r\nurgently to address the issue of the external debt of \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \r\nimportance of the effective implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. We hope that the 2008 Review \r\nConference will focus on strengthening implementation \r\nand follow-up. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to Mr. Jean-Marie Ehouzou, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Benin. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates. \r\n The International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, held at Monterrey in March 2002, \r\nresulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus. \r\nThe Consensus called for the mobilization of resources \r\nto finance and support the achievement of \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It also \r\ncalled for the establishment of the necessary conditions \r\nto attract and sustain foreign investment and to produce \r\ngreater trade liberalization, an easing of the debt \r\nburden and good governance at all levels. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus identified steps to be \r\ntaken to mobilize financial resources at the national \r\nand international levels, to use international trade as an \r\nengine of development, to strengthen international \r\nfinancial and technical cooperation for development, to \r\nreduce external debt and to rectify systemic problems \r\nin the international financial and economic architecture \r\nby strengthening the coherence of the international \r\nmonetary, financial and trading systems in support of \r\ndevelopment and by promoting the equal \r\nrepresentation of developing countries in the \r\ninternational decision-making process. \r\n The Group of African States is pleased that we \r\nare meeting in plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly at such a high level for the third time in five \r\nyears to discuss the issue of financing for development. \r\nOur debate is timely, as we are currently preparing for \r\nthe international review of the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, which is to take place in 2008 at \r\nDoha, Qatar. As we have said on many occasions, \r\nAfrica has acknowledged the need to assume primary \r\nresponsibility for finding solutions to its development \r\nchallenges. Africa took practical steps in that regard \r\nwhen it adopted the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) as the main framework to \r\npursue sustainable development. We should strengthen \r\nit and provide it with substance. Nevertheless, we \r\nshould also stress that sound domestic policies in \r\nAfrica must enjoy adequate support from the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n African countries believe that the usual way of \r\ndoing things has to date not been able to help them \r\nmeet all their needs or to address their priorities in the \r\nareas of trade and development. Urgent steps should \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n9 07-56101 \r\n \r\ntherefore be taken to fill in those gaps — through \r\nfinancial measures and by developing and \r\nstrengthening institutional and human capacities. With \r\nregard to countries emerging from conflict with little \r\nstructural absorptive capacity, priority should be given \r\nto capacity-building. \r\n It is important to ensure that the aid flows \r\ndestined for African countries are sufficient, reliable \r\nand predictable and capable of stimulating the \r\nfinancing of investment programmes, particularly in \r\nthe area of infrastructure. The provision of aid should \r\nbe channelled through mechanisms that are flexible \r\nand adaptable to the specific situation of each country. \r\nMoreover, it is our view that aid can be made more \r\neffective by better aligning aid programmes with the \r\ndevelopment priorities of the recipient countries and by \r\nmore closely harmonizing the policies and practices of \r\ndevelopment partners, since this can result in lower \r\ntransaction costs and make ODA more effective. \r\n Developed countries must therefore live up to \r\ntheir pledges; those countries that have yet to achieve \r\nthe long-standing target of 0.7 per cent of their gross \r\nnational income as official development assistance, \r\nwith 0.15 to 0.2 per cent allocated to the least \r\ndeveloped countries, must fulfil their commitments in \r\norder to maintain their credibility. \r\n For their part, the developing countries receiving \r\nassistance must continue their efforts to establish an \r\neffective, fair and stable institutional framework, in \r\norder to strengthen the rule of law and to promote all \r\ninternationally recognized human rights. Good \r\ngovernance means favouring a properly functioning, \r\ntransparent government, accountable to its people and \r\npermitting the poorest, notably through promoting \r\nsocial integration, to increase their participation in \r\npolitical life and processes. \r\n Africa needs genuine partnership in order to \r\novercome its numerous challenges and problems. \r\nAmong other measures, it needs international market \r\naccess for its products and investments that generate \r\nresources in order to be able to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n For the international community to make \r\nglobalization work for Africa and for trade to truly \r\nserve as the engine for economic growth, it is \r\nimportant and urgent that it works towards a \r\nmultilateral, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory and \r\nequitable trading system. In this regard, the \r\nnegotiations on the Doha Development Agenda should \r\nconclude with outcomes that facilitate development \r\nand allow for the elimination of unfair trade subsidies \r\ngiven by developed countries to their producers, \r\nparticularly in agriculture. \r\n In addition, African countries’ efforts at \r\nrestructuring, diversifying and strengthening the \r\ncompetitiveness of their commodity sectors, including \r\nthrough local processing, should be supported, in \r\nparticular by enhanced market access on a secure and \r\npredictable basis, adequate technical and financial \r\nassistance and the strengthening of institutional \r\ncapacities. \r\n With regard to the thorny issue of debt \r\nrepayment, African countries have insistently and \r\nrepeatedly called for a 100 per cent cancellation of \r\ntheir debts and for the adoption of a negotiated \r\nframework that mitigates risks and prevents the \r\nrecurrence of serious fiscal and financial crises due to \r\nheavy indebtedness.  \r\n Finally, African countries are concerned over the \r\nlack of concrete results in the discussions on improving \r\nthe governance and coherence of international \r\nmonetary, financial and commercial systems, as well as \r\non increasing the participation of developing countries \r\nin the international discussions and decision-making \r\nprocesses, especially within the World Bank and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. We truly hope to be \r\nheard on these points because the appeals put forth \r\nyesterday by these two institutions deeply affected us. \r\n The African Group takes this opportunity again to \r\nremind all parties of the need to abide by commitments \r\nundertaken and to do so in a spirit of partnership, \r\nresponsibility and mutual interdependence. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. John McNee, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Canada. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): I have the honour to speak \r\ntoday on behalf of Australia, New Zealand and Canada \r\nto express our support for the ongoing dialogue on \r\nfinancing for development. I would also like to make it \r\nclear that an election has been called in Australia and \r\nthe Government there is currently operating under \r\ncaretaker provisions. This debate will provide us all \r\nwith a welcome opportunity to share ideas on how \r\ncountries can take advantage of all sources of financing \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 10 \r\n \r\nin order to meet their development objectives and \r\nreach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Recent efforts by many Member States, including \r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand, have galvanized \r\ninternational efforts towards meeting the MDGs. \r\nDevelopment, though, as we all know, is a long and \r\ndifficult path. It is only in partnership with all \r\nstakeholders that the international community will \r\nhave a success story to tell. We are committed to \r\nsupporting this effort and reiterate our support of the \r\nMDG declaration and its goals. \r\n Five years ago, the international community came \r\ntogether in Monterrey and agreed to a set of principles \r\nto assist countries’ development efforts. Those \r\nprinciples, embodied by the Monterrey Consensus, are \r\nan explicit recognition that aid alone is insufficient to \r\nmeet internationally agreed development goals. \r\nProgress towards meeting these goals requires an \r\nintegrated approach that mobilizes all sources of \r\nfinancing, including trade liberalization, official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), debt relief, foreign \r\ndirect investment, remittances and domestic financing. \r\n Since Monterrey, we have also joined other \r\ncomplementary efforts to examine approaches for \r\nimproving the coherence of overall aid effectiveness, \r\nincluding through our endorsement of the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. We look forward to a \r\nfull discussion of these and other issues during today’s \r\nstakeholder round tables. \r\n An enabling domestic environment is also crucial \r\nfor mobilizing financing for development. Such an \r\nenabling environment should be able to attract, retain \r\nand effectively use all sources of financing, including \r\ntaxes, investment, trade, ODA and remittances. \r\nMoreover, good governance and concrete efforts to \r\nreduce corruption are required to ensure that scarce \r\nfinancial resources are used effectively and \r\nappropriately to fight hunger, poverty and disease. \r\n Trade liberalization is an important driver for \r\ndevelopment. We stress the need for achieving an \r\nambitious, balanced and comprehensive agreement on \r\nthe Doha Development Agenda, which would enhance \r\nglobal trade significantly, especially among and \r\nbetween developed and developing countries and, at \r\nthe same time, reinforce multilateral trade rules. \r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand remain fully \r\ncommitted to the development dimension of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda, promoting progressive trade \r\nliberalization, helping developing countries integrate \r\nbetter into the multilateral trading system and \r\nproviding support to the poorest countries. This will \r\nenable them to benefit from the significant \r\nopportunities offered by globalization. We also \r\ncontinue to support special and differential treatment \r\nfor developing countries, and place strong emphasis on \r\nthe role of trade-related technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building to address the needs of developing \r\ncountries. \r\n In the past, unsustainable debt burdens have \r\nconstrained the ability of countries to allocate \r\nsufficient resources to their development objectives. \r\nEfforts by the international community, including \r\nfinancial institutions, have assisted the most heavily \r\nindebted poor countries to escape from that burden. We \r\nmust work together to ensure that countries benefiting \r\nfrom debt relief are able to avoid the trap of \r\nunmanageable debt burdens. It is also important that \r\nlending frameworks of financial institutions be sound \r\nand that the fiscal and debt-management capacity of \r\ndeveloping countries continue to be improved. The \r\ntransparent exchange of information between creditors \r\nand improved coordination based on existing \r\nmechanisms are also important steps for ensuring long-\r\nterm debt sustainability, as well as economic and \r\nfinancial stability. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Since Monterrey, developing countries and \r\ndonors have also worked together in a spirit of \r\npartnership to improve the coherence and effectiveness \r\nof development assistance in order to better support \r\nnational efforts to fight poverty. Such efforts are \r\nunderpinned by the principles and commitments set out \r\nin the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The third \r\nHigh-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, to be held in \r\nAccra next year, shortly before the Doha meeting, will \r\nbe a good opportunity to take stock of our progress, \r\naddress some outstanding challenges, and enrich the \r\nParis framework as a reference point for improving the \r\neffectiveness of development assistance. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus remains a strong, \r\ninternationally agreed framework for promoting \r\ndevelopment cooperation and poverty reduction. We \r\nsee no need to reconsider those principles, as they have \r\nserved us well. When we meet in Doha in the second \r\nhalf of 2008, the international community should take \r\nadvantage of the opportunity to share best practices \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n11 07-56101 \r\n \r\nand lessons learned, identify challenges that have \r\nemerged, and consider means by which to overcome \r\nthem. \r\n If Doha 2008 is to be a success, all relevant \r\nstakeholders, including civil society organizations and \r\nthe private sector, should be encouraged to participate \r\nactively in both the preparatory process and in the \r\nreview Conference itself. In conclusion, the challenges \r\nfor development are enormous; let us therefore work \r\ntogether to ensure that Doha 2008 produces real \r\nresults. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Eduardo Gálvez, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Chile, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nRio Group. \r\n Mr. Gálvez (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): At their \r\nnineteenth summit, held in Guyana on 2 and 3 March, \r\nthe heads of State and Government of the Rio Group — \r\ncomprised of Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, \r\nColombia, Costa Rica, Chile, the Dominican Republic, \r\nGuyana, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, \r\nMexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay \r\nand the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela — \r\nreaffirmed their willingness to continue to promote the \r\ncoordinated implementation of the series of measures \r\nagreed in the Monterrey Consensus on financing for \r\ndevelopment, including the development of new and \r\ninnovative sources of financing, taking into account the \r\nreview process scheduled for 2008 in Doha, Qatar. To \r\nthat end, they decided to establish a working group to \r\ndefine the position of the Rio Group at that \r\nConference. With that mandate, it was decided that \r\nChile would coordinate the working group, and it is in \r\nthat capacity that I address the General Assembly. \r\n We welcome the organization of this High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development. This is an \r\nextremely important topic for the countries of the Rio \r\nGroup, which met as a working group in Santiago in \r\nSeptember and at United Nations Headquarters in New \r\nYork last Friday. Those meetings provided a good \r\nopportunity for experts and officials of the Rio Group \r\nmember countries to reflect on the national, \r\ninternational and systemic topics addressed in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus with a view to contributing to \r\nthe work to be done by the international community to \r\nensure the success of the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to Review \r\nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus. \r\n As its first contribution, our Group submits to \r\nthis General Assembly the following position statement \r\nof the Rio Group. \r\n First, the Rio Group is grateful to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for convening the High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development within the \r\nframework of preparations for the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha in the second \r\nhalf of 2008. \r\n Second, the Rio Group hopes that the debates, \r\nboth in plenary and at the six round tables during this \r\nDialogue, will provide a useful input to guide the \r\ncontinuing preparatory process for the Doha \r\nConference. \r\n Third, the Rio Group believes that the \r\npreparatory process for Doha 2008 should be open to \r\nparticipation by all stakeholders directly or indirectly \r\ninvolved in financing for development, including \r\nStates, international financial institutions, relevant \r\nbodies of the United Nations system, and other \r\ninternational regional and subregional agencies, as well \r\nas civil society and the private sector. \r\n Fourth, the Group believes that the components \r\nof the Monterrey Consensus concerning national, \r\ninternational and systemic development financing \r\nissues should be dealt with in the preparatory process, \r\nwith the possibility of including important new \r\nquestions. It also stresses the need for the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference to assess progress made, \r\nreaffirm goals and commitments, share best practices \r\nand lessons learned, and identify obstacles and \r\nconstraints encountered, and actions and initiatives to \r\novercome them, as indicated in paragraph 3 of \r\nresolution 61/191. The Group hopes that the discussion \r\nof the draft resolution on conference arrangements and \r\nother substantive aspects will commence as soon as \r\npossible so as to allow proper preparation by the \r\nvarious stakeholders. \r\n Fifth, the Rio Group recognizes that each country \r\nis responsible for its own economic and social \r\ndevelopment. In that context, the members of the \r\nGroup have taken action, adopted policies and \r\nimplemented national development plans that are \r\ngeared to the mobilization of our domestic resources \r\nand growth-oriented. \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 12 \r\n \r\n Sixth, the Group also recognizes that national \r\ndevelopment initiatives must be complemented by \r\nmultilateral support programmes, measures and \r\npolicies designed to expand our countries’ development \r\nopportunities, as well as to strengthen international \r\ncooperation. \r\n Seventh, in addition, the Rio Group stresses the \r\nimportance of continued support for middle-income \r\ncountries, including landlocked developing countries, \r\nin their poverty relief efforts. It invites the \r\ninternational community to consider additional, more \r\neffective criteria for assistance to middle-income \r\ncountries and the implementation of new and \r\ninnovative mechanisms for extending to them the more \r\nfocused cooperation required to eliminate pressure and \r\nconsolidate the advances achieved to date. \r\n Eighth, the Group emphasizes that the 2008 Doha \r\nConference should not only recommit to \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, but also \r\nreview the progress made since 2002. That includes the \r\nlaunching of successful specific initiatives involving \r\ninnovative financing mechanisms adopted in the \r\nregion, which are designed not to replace but to \r\ncomplement official development assistance. \r\n Ninth, citing the “spirit of Monterrey” as an \r\nexample of the willingness of the international \r\ncommunity to find avenues for achieving progress \r\ntogether in the quest for development for all, the Group \r\nstresses that any other high-level events and \r\ninternational initiatives related to the topic of \r\ndevelopment and the elimination of poverty should be \r\nappropriately coordinated with the preparatory process \r\nfor the Doha Conference. \r\n Tenth, the Rio Group reaffirms its commitment to \r\nstrengthening the follow-up to the implementation of \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and emphasizes the \r\nimportance of using all of the institutional mechanisms \r\nfor effective follow-up to the International Conference \r\non Financing for Development. The Group reiterates its \r\ninterest in enhanced follow-up and has a flexible \r\nattitude towards the possibility of reviewing the \r\neffectiveness of existing follow-up mechanisms and \r\ntowards the study and identification of concrete \r\nproposals that may promote this goal. The Group \r\nconsiders that the High-level Dialogues of the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, the \r\nnew Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) and \r\nAnnual Ministerial Review of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, as well as the work of Committee of Experts \r\non International Cooperation in Tax Matters, should \r\ncontribute not only to the follow-up but also to the \r\nestablishment and strengthening of associations and \r\ninternational cooperation to guarantee resource \r\nmobilization at the national and international levels. \r\nTheir effective use should promote the achievement of \r\nsocially inclusive development. \r\n Eleventh, the Rio Group reiterates the importance \r\nof enhancing the gender perspective in the follow-up to \r\nthe International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and on the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus.  \r\n Finally, the Group wishes to offer its support and \r\ncooperation to the Facilitators designated by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for all issues related \r\nto the International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, Ambassador Maged Abdelaziz of Egypt \r\nand Ambassador Johan Løvald of Norway. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Alejandro Wolff, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the United States of \r\nAmerica. \r\n Mr. Wolff (United States of America): I am very \r\npleased to represent the United States at this important \r\ndialogue today. In his remarks at the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development in March \r\n2002, President Bush spoke clearly about the United \r\nStates commitment to bring hope and opportunity to \r\nthe world’s poorest people. He called for a new \r\ncompact for development defined by greater \r\naccountability for rich and poor nations alike and \r\npledged to increase our core development assistance by \r\n50 per cent over three years. As we launch a review of \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus, it is fair to ask if we have \r\ndelivered on that compact. How can we improve our \r\njoint efforts to draw even more developing countries \r\ninto the expanding global tide of economic growth, \r\ndemocracy and social progress? \r\n Looking back, one important point seems very \r\nclear — the power of the ideas in the Consensus \r\ndocument has sparked a wave of reforms and \r\ninitiatives, both domestic and international, aimed at \r\ntapping all the potential resources and sources of \r\nfinancing needed to fuel development. Today, there are \r\nserious initiatives under way in all areas of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. Let me list just a few of these.  \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n13 07-56101 \r\n \r\n First, since 2002, dozens of developing countries \r\nat all income levels have enacted tough reforms to \r\nstabilize their economies, liberalize their trading \r\nregimes and improve their business climates, which has \r\nunlocked substantial new private sources of financing \r\nfor development.  \r\n Secondly, during the same period, donors have \r\nsubstantially raised the volume of development \r\nassistance, from approximately $58 billion in 2002 to \r\n$104 billion in 2006. Under President Bush’s \r\nleadership, the United States has more than doubled \r\nour assistance since 2002 to $23.5 billion in 2006, far \r\nexceeding our national pledge. \r\n Thirdly, as called for in the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, donors are working together to improve the \r\neffectiveness of aid under the Paris Declaration \r\nprocess. \r\n Fourthly, the United Nations Economic and \r\nSocial Council has launched two important new \r\ndiscussion forums, the Annual Ministerial Review and \r\nthe Development Cooperation Forum. \r\n Finally, debt relief has accelerated greatly since \r\nMonterrey. The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative \r\n(MDRI) has already provided nearly $42 billion in debt \r\nforgiveness. This amount is in addition to the nearly \r\n$45 billion in bilateral debt relief provided to \r\n31 countries under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries (HIPC) Initiative.  \r\n Five and a half years after 2002, it is very clear \r\nthat this wave of reforms, initiatives and greater \r\nresources has brought significant results. The world as \r\na whole is on track to reach our goal of cutting poverty \r\nby half by 2015. Many developing countries have made \r\nsubstantial improvements in their macroeconomic \r\nmanagement, and trade liberalization is paying \r\ndividends, as merchandise trade continues to grow. \r\nExports from sub-Saharan Africa increased 23 per cent \r\nin 2006, faster than the global rate of 16 per cent. \r\nPrivate financial flows to developing countries have \r\nalso grown substantially since Monterrey, to reach \r\n$571 billion in 2006. Annual growth in per capita \r\nincome in low income countries averaged four per cent \r\nin the first five years of the new millennium, before \r\nclimbing to almost six per cent in 2006. \r\n Despite these successes, our job is far from \r\nfinished. Some of the world’s poorest countries have \r\nnot kept pace and may not meet our shared \r\ncommitment to the internationally agreed Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Many countries have not \r\ndone enough to foster domestic resource mobilization \r\nor attract private capital flows. Donors certainly need \r\nto do more to improve the effectiveness of our aid. \r\n Many participants in this forum have referred to \r\nthe “spirit of Monterrey”, the sense of shared \r\ncommitment and determination that underpinned the \r\nsuccess of the International Conference of the \r\nFinancing for Development. One of the major \r\nchallenges we jointly face will be finding a way to \r\nrecapture this spirit, so that the Doha review \r\nconference has the best possible chance of success.  \r\n Let me close by offering a few suggestions on \r\nhow, together, we might do this. First, the Monterrey \r\nprocess was strongly grounded in real-world problems \r\nand solutions, and relied heavily on expert advice. We \r\nshould follow this strategy again. As a first step, the \r\nSecretariat should generate more detailed data on the \r\nhundreds of billions of dollars in capital flows to and \r\nfrom developing countries, both official and private, as \r\nwell as on their domestic policy mixes. \r\n Secondly, we should focus on how to move \r\nforward within the very large areas of consensus in the \r\n2002 Monterrey outcome document, and avoid being \r\ndistracted by peripheral debates or issues being \r\nnegotiated in other forums. \r\n Thirdly, we need to devote special attention to \r\nhow the United Nations system can assist those \r\ncountries that, for whatever reason, have not been able \r\nto take advantage of the promise of Monterrey. \r\n Finally, we should look more closely at the \r\nimportant new challenges and issues that have grown \r\nin importance since Monterrey, such as public-private \r\npartnerships, the power of the private sector and \r\nentrepreneurship, and the special role of microfinance \r\nin developing countries. \r\n The United States looks forward to working very \r\nclosely over the year ahead in the spirit of Monterrey \r\nwith both our developed and our developing country \r\npartners. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Memduh Aslan \r\nAkçay, Director General, Foreign Economic Relations, \r\nUnder secretariat of Treasury of Turkey. \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 14 \r\n \r\n Mr. Akçay (Turkey): My delegation has aligned \r\nitself with the statement delivered by the representative \r\nof Portugal on behalf of the European Union. That \r\nbeing said, I would like to expound on a few points \r\nregarding financing for development.  \r\n As is known, we are halfway to the deadline for \r\nachieving the MDGs and closing in on the Review \r\nConference on the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, which will be held in Doha at the end of \r\nnext year. The Doha Conference will provide a good \r\nopportunity to re-evaluate needs and actions in our \r\nglobal response to the challenges of financing for \r\ndevelopment. I would like to share some of our \r\nexperiences, implementations and efforts for reaching a \r\nfully inclusive and equitable global economic system \r\nwith the aim of reducing poverty through growth.  \r\n Since 2002, there has been tangible progress in \r\nfulfilling the commitments set out in the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, especially in the fields of creating domestic \r\ngovernance structures conducive to investment, \r\nmobilizing foreign direct investment (FDI) and \r\naddressing the issues of external debt and official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). However, we, as the \r\nglobal community, are aware that much remains to be \r\ndone.  \r\n Development aid, debt relief and free trade are \r\ngenerally viewed as essential components of \r\ndevelopment. However, as experience has taught us, \r\nsole reliance on development aid does not bring about \r\nsustainable development in the long term. In this \r\nrespect, in the short term, the efforts of both developed \r\nand developing countries should focus on fulfilling \r\naid-related commitments. Keeping the development \r\nengine running by making concrete contributions to \r\ncapacity-building is of the utmost importance. In the \r\nlong run, consolidating existing efforts towards a more \r\nrepresentative system of global economic architecture \r\nand creating a more accessible international trade \r\nregime will gain significance. Yet, in each of our steps \r\nwe should pay due respect to mutual accountability and \r\ntransparency.  \r\n We actively participate in international efforts \r\naimed at the eradication of poverty. We consider \r\nofficial development assistance to be one of the main \r\ntools in reinforcing the development efforts of \r\ndeveloping countries. Turkey itself is a developing \r\ncountry, and the ODA it provides to that end has been \r\nsteadily increasing over recent years. ODA that we \r\nhave provided reached $601 million in 2005 and \r\ncurrently stands at $750 million, 0.18 per cent of our \r\ngross national product (GNP). It is worthwhile to note \r\nthat Turkey has become an emerging donor for Africa. \r\nMoreover, we exert every effort to contribute to social \r\ndevelopment in the fields of human rights, children’s \r\nissues and the promotion of the status of women.  \r\n At present, the Turkish International Cooperation \r\nand Development Agency is carrying out hundreds of \r\nprojects in partner countries from Central Asia to the \r\nBalkans, from the Middle East to Africa, and from the \r\nAsia-Pacific region to Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. With 22 field offices, it contributes to the \r\ndevelopment of many countries in various regions. \r\nThese projects have already started to make a positive \r\nimpact. For this reason, a fund of $15 million was \r\nallocated for the implementation of projects through \r\nthe Turkish International Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment Agency in least developed countries, \r\nlandlocked developing countries and small island \r\ndeveloping States.  \r\n Let me inform the Assembly about our efforts \r\nwith regard to international development issues. As a \r\nparty to the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Paris Declaration on Aid \r\nEffectiveness, we have been active in concrete policy \r\nactions in financing for development. In this vein, it is \r\na great pleasure for me to state that Turkey is now a \r\nglobal provider of significant humanitarian and \r\ntechnical aid. For instance, in 2005 we provided funds \r\nand assistance in kind amounting to more than \r\n$232 million to 25 countries on various continents. \r\nThat figure does not include the aid provided by \r\nTurkish non-governmental organizations.  \r\n The economic outlook of the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) is of special importance in terms of \r\nachieving internationally agreed development goals. \r\nWe have to bear in mind that improving the living \r\nconditions of over 600 million people residing in LDCs \r\nis a litmus test for making poverty history. In line with \r\nthis conviction, we appreciate and support the efforts \r\nexerted by LDCs and development partners, including \r\ninternational organizations.  \r\n As a manifestation of our contribution to global \r\ndevelopment efforts, especially for the LDCs, we \r\nhosted the annual ministerial conference on Making \r\nGlobalization Work for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nfrom 9 to 11 July 2007. At the conference we pledged \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n15 07-56101 \r\n \r\nan additional $5 million to finance small and medium-\r\nscale regional development projects in the LDCs.  \r\n On the other hand, fully cognizant of the fact that \r\ninternational trade is vital for the development of \r\nLDCs, we attribute great importance to the \r\ndevelopment of bilateral commercial relations with \r\nthose countries. We are willing to provide assistance \r\nand to cooperate in the fields of agriculture, health, the \r\nenvironment and good governance. Funnelling Turkish \r\ninvestment to LDCs constitutes another aspect of our \r\npolicy. Furthermore, we promote the establishment of \r\njoint business councils and chambers of commerce.  \r\n The United Nations was established to ensure \r\nglobal peace and security. Economic growth and \r\ndevelopment play a significant role in reaching the \r\nlofty goals for which the United Nations stands. \r\nTurkey, as a country generating peace, stability and \r\nwelfare in its region and beyond, is an active supporter \r\nof activities of the United Nations in all spheres.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like, on behalf of my \r\ncountry, to avail myself of this opportunity to praise \r\nthe President of the General Assembly, Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, and the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwhose able leadership and wisdom successfully guided \r\nmembers in organizing this event. This event is a \r\nsignificant step in reaching the overarching goal of \r\nmaking poverty history. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Irene \r\nFreudenschuss-Reichl, Director-General of the \r\nDepartment for Development Cooperation of Austria.  \r\n Ms. Freudenschuss-Reichl (Austria): At the \r\noutset, I should like to support wholeheartedly the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Portugal \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU).  \r\n Since the International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, held in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2002, \r\na number of important developments have occurred. I \r\nshould like to reflect briefly on some of those \r\ndevelopments and to draw from them some questions \r\nregarding the lead-up to the 2008 Doha Conference.  \r\n First, the 2005 World Summit witnessed a \r\ncommitment by the European Union and its Member \r\nStates to a significant scaling up of official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). Austria is fully \r\ncommitted to that scaling up. I am happy to report that \r\nwe have significantly surpassed the target set for 2006, \r\nwhich was to bring ODA up to at least 0.33 per cent of \r\ngross national income. Development Assistance \r\nCommittee (DAC) figures show that Austria reached \r\n0.51 per cent in 2005 and 0.48 per cent in 2006; we \r\nanticipate similar figures for 2007 and 2008. In its \r\nprogramme for the twenty-third legislative period, the \r\nAustrian Government strongly reiterated, in January \r\n2007, its commitment to reach 0.51 per cent of ODA \r\nby 2010. For 2015, the EU target is 0.7 per cent.  \r\n In order to maintain support from our taxpayers \r\nfor the significant increases that will be required to \r\nreach the EU targets, it will be important that other \r\ndonors scale up their efforts in comparable ways and \r\nthat we continue to improve aid effectiveness.  \r\n The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, \r\nadopted in 2005, which Austria strongly supports, \r\ncaptures the consensus of the donor community and \r\npartner countries on how development assistance can \r\nbecome more effectively supportive of partner \r\ncountries’ development plans and strategies, inter alia \r\nby promoting direct budget support.  \r\n As more donors move to use the modality of \r\ndirect budget support — and Austria is moving in that \r\ndirection with due caution and sensitivity as well — it \r\nbecomes apparent how severely dependent many \r\npartner countries’ national budgets are on external \r\nfinancing. This, in my view, reduces the scope for \r\nnational ownership, which we have all recognized as \r\nirreplaceable. My second point, therefore, is that more \r\nemphasis needs to be placed on strengthening the \r\npublic finances of partner countries. \r\n Important non-governmental organizations have \r\nissued a call to the Assembly to place greater focus on \r\nmore effective cooperation on tax and fiscal matters. In \r\nmy view, their advice bears scrutiny. \r\n My third point is that, since Monterrey, the hopes \r\nplaced in the Doha Development Round have not yet \r\ncome to fruition. In the context of the Cotonou \r\nrelationship between the European Union and the \r\ngroup of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, \r\nimportant negotiations are moving towards finalization \r\non Economic Partnership Agreements. Austria has \r\nconsistently advocated a strong developmental content \r\nfor these Agreements and is committed to supporting \r\nthem as tools to promote development. \r\n Fourthly, growing conceptual clarity has emerged \r\nsince Monterrey on the role of global public goods and \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 16 \r\n \r\ntheir relationship with development objectives. This \r\nissue may well warrant attention at the 2008 Doha \r\nConference on Financing for Development. \r\n My fifth point is about the nexus of development \r\nand security, which is increasingly seen as crucial for \r\nachieving sustainable gains, both in terms of freedom \r\nfrom fear and freedom from want. The reform summit \r\nof 2005 acknowledged the importance of this nexus, \r\ninter alia, by establishing the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. The international community is directing \r\nconsiderable financial flows towards a significant \r\nnumber of developing countries by means of complex \r\nmissions and is increasingly concerned with State \r\nfragility and how to prevent it. It can only be beneficial \r\nto the international community and the countries \r\nconcerned to deepen our insights on how to maximize \r\nthe developmental impact of complex missions by \r\nusing all the available leverage, be it procurement \r\nprocedures that stimulate the local economy or other \r\nbest practices that can be distilled from experience. \r\n My sixth point is that awareness about the \r\nimportance of drawing on the wisdom, resilience and \r\ncapacities of women is growing in all areas pertaining \r\nto international cooperation. The Monterrey Consensus \r\nis not explicit on issues of gender mainstreaming, yet, \r\nthe ways in which financing is generated and used for \r\ndevelopment and the opportunities for women to \r\nparticipate in issues of development financing — from \r\naccess to microcredits to the elaboration of national \r\npoverty reduction strategies to the parliamentary \r\noversight of national budgets — may well have a \r\nsignificant impact on the results achieved. Perhaps this, \r\ntoo, is an area where Doha could make progress. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Carlos Jativa, \r\nDirector-General of the Institute for International \r\nCooperation of Ecuador. \r\n Mr. Jativa (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to thank the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nand associate myself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Pakistan and Chile. \r\n The delegation of Ecuador believes that, while \r\nthere have been several important points of progress in \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus, there are other commitments \r\nthat are far from being guaranteed; such is also the case \r\nwith the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In \r\nboth cases, the availability, quality and use of resources \r\nmake up one of the main impediments, as can be read \r\nfrom the various reports of the Secretary-General. \r\n In spite of the fact that the worldwide volume of \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) has increased, \r\nreaching its peak in 2005, the proportion of ODA for \r\nthe Latin American region has decreased. Furthermore, \r\nthere persists in considering aid flows the expenses \r\nlinked to assistance to refugees and to the alleviation of \r\nthe external debt, to which are added expenses which \r\nare merely bureaucratic and administrative in nature. \r\nODA has favoured conflict and post-conflict situations \r\nand has responded to commercial interests. \r\n In this framework, the middle-income countries \r\nhave gained special attention, being the subject of two \r\nconferences in Madrid and San Salvador this year. This \r\nconfirms the reality of the situation in a world, where \r\nour countries represent more than 47 per cent of the \r\nworld’s population and where 41 per cent of the poor \r\npeople live on less than $2 a day. In the case of Latin \r\nAmerica, poverty subsists at more than 95 per cent in \r\nthe middle-income countries. \r\n This is why Ecuador has expressed its concern \r\nregarding the priority application of macroeconomic \r\ncriteria, especially the per capita gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP), which has become an adverse factor \r\nfor qualification for ODA. This has marginalized other \r\nmeasuring instruments, including human development \r\nindices, and it ignores the enormous inequalities that \r\nexist within our countries, which are the main barrier \r\nto economic development and equality. \r\n That is the reason we have promoted an active \r\npolicy for development cooperation with middle-\r\nincome countries, in line with the objectives set out in \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus, which means new resources \r\nand coherent policies at the global level for economic, \r\nfinancial and commercial matters. \r\n Similarly, it is imperative that we abandon rigid \r\nranking criteria and move towards a more flexible \r\nstrategy, with clear guidance for the more \r\nhomogeneous groups of developing countries. In this \r\nsame context, we should look for South-South \r\ncooperation, triangular cooperation — making viable \r\nthe former — and cooperative efforts of our countries \r\nwith regional integration mechanisms. \r\n After rejecting the mistaken notions of \r\nneo-liberalism on the role of the State, Ecuador has \r\nrecovered its planning as a tool for public management. \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n17 07-56101 \r\n \r\nWe have our National Development Plan, which is a \r\ndynamic tool for public harmonization of our system \r\nfor planning, budgeting and evaluation. The plan has \r\n12 human development objectives, through which we \r\nhope to follow the paradigm of well-being. \r\n In order to achieve all this, we advocate a sound, \r\nbalanced policy, beginning with the National \r\nDevelopment Plan, with its strategies, mechanisms and \r\nindicators subject to examination by civil society. In \r\nfinance, the people’s revolutionary Government of \r\nPresident Rafael Correa has transformed the allocation \r\nof the budget towards the priorities of development, \r\nespecially in the fields of health, education and social \r\nwelfare, with public institutions duly reformed and \r\nstrengthened. \r\n Less than one month ago, we held a historic \r\nelection of 130 members of our Constituent National \r\nAssembly, under the aegis of a transparent process that \r\nis fully democratic. Beyond just a new Constitution, \r\nthe Ecuadorian people seek to redefine the role of the \r\nState and its institutions, as well to lay the basis for a \r\ntruly democratic system, dedicated to good \r\ngovernance, which will in turn have very important \r\nconsequences for international cooperation. \r\n On this basis, we believe that ODA should be \r\nbased on five criteria — flexibility in planning matters, \r\npredictability in terms of amounts and means of \r\nimplementation, in accordance with budgeting \r\nprogrammes; support for the essential task of \r\novercoming poverty and inequality; the construction of \r\nan association of partners with a focus on shared \r\nresponsibility; and the appropriation of major resources \r\nfor development priorities and for strengthening \r\nnational capacities. \r\n With regard to the necessary and compulsory \r\nreform of the international financial institutions, which \r\nare still fledgling and limited, a group of South \r\nAmerican countries, including Ecuador, have taken the \r\ninitiative to set up with the next few days the Bank of \r\nthe South. It will be called upon to support its members \r\nin the achievement of development with a human face, \r\nas well as to provide financial assistance, under fair \r\nand equal conditions, in order to eliminate poverty and \r\nachieve  results. \r\n Ecuador welcomes the innovative forms of \r\nfinancing for development and takes this opportunity to \r\nstress the approach promoted by the President of \r\nEcuador here at this Assembly on 26 September. He \r\nbrought a specific and original proposal to contribute \r\nto reducing carbon dioxide emissions and to \r\nenvironmental protection in one of the most biodiverse \r\nareas of the world through a project known as Yasuní-\r\nITT. He announced that Ecuador would be willing to \r\nmake the tremendous sacrifice of forgoing an annual \r\ninvestment of approximately $720 million from oil \r\nextraction in return for the assumption of \r\nco-responsibility by the international community, and \r\nthe developed countries in particular, via minimum \r\ncompensation for the environmental property being \r\npreserved, which is one of the most valuable public \r\nproperties on the planet. \r\n In our view, that would set an extraordinary \r\nexample of collective action at the global level. The \r\nimplementation of the project will not only reduce \r\nglobal warming, to the benefit of all, but also launch a \r\nnew economic logic for the twenty-first century that \r\ncompensates the generation of value and not merely \r\ncommodities. \r\n I conclude by reaffirming that proposal and ask \r\neveryone to consider, in the Monterrey spirit, new \r\nmodalities for international cooperation whereby the \r\nmeaning of official development assistance would \r\nembrace complementarity, co-responsibility and \r\nsolidarity with the objectives of human development, \r\nas well as the concept of foreign assistance based on \r\nnational priorities defined by its beneficiaries and \r\npropelled by the stimulus and mobilizing power of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Yukio Takasu, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Japan. \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): I thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for convening the High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development. This is an \r\nextremely important issue for all of us.  \r\n In implementing financing for development, it is \r\nimportant to take stock of the progress that has been \r\nmade in the efforts to achieve development, in \r\nparticular the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The most recent report \r\non the MDGs shows that considerable advances are \r\nbeing made towards several targets. Extreme poverty, \r\nfor instance, is declining in East and South Asia.  \r\n However, at the current rate of progress, it would \r\nbe difficult for sub-Saharan countries to achieve any of \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 18 \r\n \r\nthe Goals by 2015. Without solving the challenges \r\nfacing Africa, the world cannot enjoy stability and \r\nprosperity in the twenty-first century, which are the \r\nvery objectives and imperatives of development itself.  \r\n Japan will therefore continue to make African \r\ndevelopment its highest priority. We will host the \r\nfourth Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment (TICAD IV) next May, together with the \r\nUnited Nations, the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and the World Bank. Japan hopes that \r\nTICAD IV will further mobilize the knowledge, \r\nexperience and, above all, resources of the \r\ninternational community for African development, and \r\nthus contribute to African countries’ efforts to fully \r\nadvance and meet the MDGs. \r\n Many commitments on development funding \r\nhave been made since the 2002 Monterrey Conference. \r\nWhat is most important now is to put commitments \r\ninto action. Japan, despite severe financial constraints, \r\nis striving to meet its commitment to increase its \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) volume by \r\n$10 billion in aggregate between 2005 and 2009, and to \r\ndouble its ODA to Africa between 2005 and the end of \r\nthis year. We are making every effort to honour that \r\ncommitment. \r\n In order to achieve the MDGs, the amount of \r\nresources and funding for development available from \r\npublic and various areas of the private sector is \r\nimportant. There is no doubt about that, but it is \r\nequally important that those resources be utilized \r\neffectively for the purpose intended. Resources for \r\ndevelopment should be used to meet first the urgent \r\nhuman security needs of individuals and communities. \r\nResources should also be used to build the human and \r\ninstitutional capacity necessary for developing \r\ncountries to exercise ownership of their sustainable \r\ndevelopment. I cannot overstate the importance of \r\nindividual and institutional capacity-building for \r\nenabling developing countries to maximize the use of \r\nthe domestic and external resources made available to \r\nthem. \r\n Capacity development is one of the core pillars of \r\nJapan’s assistance policy. We believe from our own \r\nhistorical experience that nation-building and national \r\ndevelopment are, after all, people-building. Japan \r\nattaches high importance to transferring the knowledge \r\nand skills necessary for national development through \r\nvocational training, technical advisory services, other \r\ntechnical cooperation programmes and student \r\nexchange. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus calls for the promotion \r\nof international trade as an engine for development, as \r\nmany speakers have emphasized before me. To that \r\nend, Japan has extended duty-free and quota-free \r\ntreatment to the least developed countries and \r\npromoted a very interesting programme — the \r\nso-called One Village, One Product campaign — which \r\nhas boosted exports in many developing countries, \r\nincluding Ghana, Thailand and Malawi, to name but a \r\nfew. \r\n Foreign direct investment is another essential \r\nengine for development that brings capital and \r\ntechnology and creates employment. To help \r\ndeveloping countries to create a favourable climate for \r\ninvestment, Japan is taking a multi-layered approach \r\nthat includes capacity and infrastructure development, \r\nas well as bilateral investment treaties and economic \r\npartnership agreements. \r\n Synergies between various types of private \r\ncapital and official development assistance are also \r\nimportant, and private enterprises should be \r\nencouraged to engage in activities that contribute to the \r\nsustainable economic growth of developing countries. \r\nThere are many good examples in that regard.  \r\n The dramatic rise in trade and investment among \r\nSouthern countries has major implications for \r\ndevelopment financing. Japan has long advocated and \r\nimplemented so-called South-South cooperation \r\nprojects because we believe that this type of \r\npartnership enhances ownership of emerging donors \r\nand recipient countries alike.  \r\n As we approach the midpoint to the 2015 target, \r\ndeveloped and developing countries alike should \r\nredouble their efforts to achieve the MDGs. Japan will \r\nuse the valuable opportunity provided by its presidency \r\nof the G-8 next year to ensure that the outcomes of \r\nTICAD IV are duly reflected in the agenda of next \r\nJuly’s Hokkaido Toyako summit meeting. We will \r\ncontinue to work constructively with our development \r\npartners, including African countries, to contribute to \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs and other international \r\ndevelopment goals. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Abdullah Ahmed Mohamed \r\nAl-Murad, chairman of the delegation of Kuwait. \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n19 07-56101 \r\n \r\n Mr. Al-Murad (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic):  \r\nMy country’s delegation is pleased to participate in this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue for the implementation of the \r\noutcome of the International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development. I would like to express our support \r\nfor the statement delivered by the Minister of \r\nEconomic Affairs of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n Five years have elapsed since the convening of \r\nthe International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment in Monterrey, Mexico. However, the \r\nfollow-up reports of the Secretary-General over the \r\nyears since the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus \r\nhave reflected a mixed bag of achievements and \r\nfailures. Despite his reference to the current situation \r\nof the world economy as one that provides an \r\nopportunity to take measures based on a long-term \r\nview, carry out reforms on the local and international \r\nlevels, and achieve wide-ranging economic growth, \r\nsustainable development and social progress, the \r\nchallenges and dangers to international peace and \r\nsecurity — such as poverty, hunger, the spread of \r\ndangerous and infectious diseases, the deterioration of \r\nthe environment and the vulnerability of the economic \r\nsystems of numerous developing countries — are still \r\npresent and threatening. \r\n Not only is it regrettable to see poverty, hunger \r\nand disease persist in developing countries; it is also \r\npainful to see more than half of the world’s population \r\nliving on under two dollars a day. This situation \r\nrequires serious consideration and review of the \r\nimpediments to development in the developing world. \r\nHere, the State of Kuwait calls upon the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) and the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions to reduce restrictions on exports of \r\ndeveloping countries, to fairly take into account the \r\nconcerns and circumstances of those countries and to \r\nestablish an international trading system that is more \r\njust and equitable for poor countries, in particular the \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs).  \r\n On the basis of Kuwait’s firm belief in human \r\nvalues and international solidarity, since independence \r\nwe have carried out a generous programme of \r\nassistance to developing countries. The Kuwait Fund \r\nfor Economic Development was established in 1961; \r\nsince then it has financed hundreds of infrastructure \r\nprojects in over 100 countries, valued at more than \r\n$12 billion, thus more than doubling the internationally \r\nagreed percentage of gross national income slated for \r\ndevelopment assistance.  \r\n The State of Kuwait is also committed to \r\nproviding annual voluntary contributions to numerous \r\ninternational specialized agencies, regional \r\norganizations and funds, and has recently appropriated \r\n$300 million for the Islamic Development Bank to help \r\neradicate poverty in Africa, in addition to its numerous \r\ndonations and humanitarian and relief aid to many \r\ncountries ravaged by natural disasters.  \r\n The State of Kuwait attaches great importance to \r\ncollective, coordinated national, regional and \r\ninternational efforts that would enable us to overcome \r\nthe problems that impede the achievement of \r\ndevelopment goals. Many developing countries are far \r\nfrom achieving those goals due to poor infrastructure, a \r\nlack of adequate financing, sufficient expertise and \r\nmodern technology, and exclusion from the full \r\nbenefits of globalization.  \r\n In this connection, developed countries must \r\nsupport the economic structures of developing \r\ncountries and fulfil their commitments to provide \r\nadequate financial and technological assistance and to \r\nreach the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income \r\nfor official development assistance (ODA). \r\nFurthermore, this aid should be provided within the \r\nframework of supporting national strategies adopted by \r\ndeveloping countries themselves.  \r\n We wish to express our appreciation for the \r\nserious efforts by some developed nations to reach the \r\ninternationally agreed level for development \r\nassistance; we also value the efforts by many \r\ndeveloping countries to apply the concepts of good \r\ngovernance and the rule of law, combat corruption and \r\nensure transparency, in order to establish democracy. \r\nAll of this can have an immediate and direct impact in \r\nterms of achieving security, stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n My country’s delegation appreciates the \r\ninitiatives of the Group of Eight industrialized \r\ncountries and of the European Union to forgive the \r\ndebts of the poorest countries. We hope that continued \r\nefforts in that direction will alleviate developing \r\ncountries’ debt burden, with the rescheduling of such \r\ndebts in accordance with Paris Club decisions and in a \r\nway that would preserve the financial strength of \r\ninternational institutions.  \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 20 \r\n \r\n In this respect, we reaffirm our support for the \r\nrecommendation in the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nfollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment (A/61/217), about the need for a \r\nparadigm shift to debt restructuring approaches that \r\nachieve self-regenerating growth in debt-distressed \r\ncountries, including the use of grants and the \r\npossibility of a 100 per cent debt cancellation. Absent \r\nthis kind of growth and the release of resources for \r\npoverty alleviation, in many countries the debt \r\noverhang will continue to be an obstacle to the \r\nachievement of the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs).  \r\n To that end, the Kuwait Fund for Economic \r\nDevelopment has contributed to the alleviation of the \r\nexternal debt of 14 heavily indebted poor countries in \r\nAfrica. The Fund reduced the debts of those countries \r\nby rescheduling them over a period of 40 years with a \r\n16-year grace period, and with interest rate spreads \r\nbetween 0.5 and 2 per cent. These terms are far easier \r\nthan the original ones. Moreover, the Fund is in the \r\nprocess of reducing the debts of other African \r\ncountries.  \r\n I wish to refer here to the principle of partnership \r\namong developing countries themselves and to the role \r\nthat the Fund for International Development of the \r\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is \r\nplaying in reducing the external debt of 18 African \r\ncountries; Kuwait is a participant in that Fund.  \r\n The time has come to change the manner and the \r\nmethod by which we deal with the challenges \r\nrepresented by the debt crisis of developing countries \r\nand to mobilize financial resources for development by \r\nshifting to the phase of action and fulfilling the \r\ncommitments undertaken at numerous international \r\nconferences and in international agreements that we \r\nhave signed and ratified.  \r\n In order for the world to move forward towards \r\nachieving the MDGs in the specified time frame, we \r\nshould take the measures necessary to save the lives of \r\nmillions of people and improve their standard of living \r\nwithin a few years, in order to reach the desired goals \r\nby the year 2015. That would be in tune with the \r\npolitical will that our leaders embodied in the \r\nMillennium Summit. It is our hope that success at the \r\nfirst Follow-up International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, scheduled to be held in Doha during \r\nthe second half of 2008, will provide hope for the \r\nachievement of that goal. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Djibouti. \r\n Mr. Olhaye (Djibouti): This occasion affords us \r\nthe opportunity to assess the agreements reached at the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment held in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2002. At \r\nthat time, we were able to arrive at what is referred to \r\nas the Monterrey Consensus, which had six core areas. \r\nIn fact, while there were six areas, the number of issues \r\ncovered was actually quite high and included many \r\ntopics, events, papers, reports, statistics and so forth. \r\nWe find ourselves in a situation, therefore, where the \r\nwelter of details and materials explored often buries us, \r\nuntil we lose our perception of what essential issues we \r\nmust consider. Have we in fact significantly improved \r\nand extended the lives of the world’s poor, particularly \r\nin Africa? Overall, is the world a better place to live in? \r\n In Monterrey, the developing countries \r\ncommitted themselves to take primary responsibility \r\nfor their own development, and to institute sound \r\nfiscal, economic and social policies. So far, the \r\nachievements in those key areas have been positive, \r\nalthough we have to acknowledge the endemic nature \r\nof poverty, particularly in Africa. More needs to be \r\ndone to increase social expenditure, to enhance \r\ninfrastructure development, to encourage more private \r\ncapital flows, to reduce obstacles to international trade, \r\nto complete the Doha Round negotiations and to forge \r\nan open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral \r\ntrading system. \r\n It is comforting to hear Mr. Robert Zoellick, the \r\nnew President of the World Bank, assert that \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly African nations, need \r\nassistance to build infrastructure for higher growth, \r\nespecially energy and physical facilities. According to \r\nMr. Zoellick, greater investments in agriculture, \r\nirrigation and rural microcredit and policies that \r\nstrengthen market opportunities are areas upon which \r\nto focus.  \r\n Through the Outcome Document of the \r\n2005 World Summit, and subsequently at the meetings \r\nof the Group of Eight (G-8) in Gleneagles in 2006 and \r\nin Heiligendamm in 2007, G-8 leaders not only \r\nreaffirmed the implementation of Monterrey \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n21 07-56101 \r\n \r\nConsensus, but also agreed to increase development \r\nassistance toward achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).  \r\n In this regard, it is important to realize that we \r\nneed fewer conferences, summits, round tables and \r\nrelentless evaluation exercises. Instead, we require \r\nperhaps, a greater acceleration of aid delivery. In short, \r\nwe lack the translation of promises into practical, \r\ntimely and adequate dispensation of resources. Again, \r\nour expectation is that the review conference on the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus in Doha \r\nnext year will mark a turning point in demonstrating \r\nthe necessary political will toward enhancing global \r\ntrust.  \r\n The report of the Secretary-General prepared for \r\nthis meeting (A/62/217) accepts that public investment \r\nhas a critical role in development. It notes the concern \r\nover the extended period characterized by insufficient \r\npublic investment in infrastructure, for example, \r\nbrought on by an overemphasis on fiscal balance and \r\nprice stability. For many this has reduced midterm \r\ngrowth prospects. Here again this report states that,  \r\n  “The original confidence that the private sector \r\nwould substitute totally for the public sector in \r\ninfrastructure has proved to be grossly misplaced. \r\n… The pubic sector and multilateral development \r\nbanks need to remain active in financing projects \r\nat times when and in places where private \r\ninvestors are unable to earn sufficiently high \r\nreturns and in low-income countries where the \r\nsupply of private financing is low...” (A/62/217, \r\npara. 23-24). \r\nCertainly this is an apt description of most of Africa. \r\nThe effort to impose private enterprise and capital on \r\nplaces and undertakings where such funds or \r\nopportunities do not exist faces many difficulties. \r\n We agree, of course, with the report’s conclusion \r\nthat there is an urgent need to increase the overall \r\nvolume of aid flows net of debt relief, technical \r\nassistance and emergency relief to meet internationally \r\nagreed development objectives. The issue of \r\nconcentration of aid flows, such that many poor,  \r\nlow-income countries receive very little aid and some \r\nexperience surges in aid flows, also needs to be \r\ncorrected. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report also explores the \r\nMonterrey Consensus call for modernizing the \r\ngovernance of global finance institutions. My \r\nGovernment is encouraged that various proposals and \r\ninitiatives are now under consideration by the boards \r\nof the World Bank and the International Monetary \r\nFund (IMF), all seeking to strengthen the participation \r\nand increase the voting power of developing countries \r\nin the process of decision-making and norm setting, in \r\norder to create a harmonious global, economic and \r\nfinancial climate.  \r\n We therefore welcome the report’s support for \r\ncurrent efforts to reform voice and participation in \r\nthese institutions, which would enhance their \r\neffectiveness and relevance to users of their resources. \r\nThis is best stated by the report:  \r\n  “The international community should close ranks \r\nand make substantial progress towards \r\ngovernance reform in IMF and the World Bank in \r\nthe next two years. At a minimum, the final \r\noutcome of the voting reallocations should result \r\nin a significant increase in the voting power of \r\ndeveloping countries as a group” (Ibid., para. 115). \r\n The Monterrey Consensus and subsequent forums \r\nurged the developed countries to make concrete efforts \r\ntowards achieving the agreed 0.7 per cent aid target to \r\ndeveloping countries, in order for these countries to \r\nhave greater ability to reduce poverty and inequality, \r\nincrease growth, build capacity and accelerate progress \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs.  \r\n In particular, as we have acknowledged in many \r\ninstances, the least developed countries, as the most \r\nunderprivileged, require special attention to enable \r\nthem to integrate into the world economy. Otherwise \r\nthey face marginalization and, for some, possible \r\ndisintegration.  \r\n Finally, these days not all resource flows for \r\ninvestment or development are from the developed \r\ncountries. Here, we need to acknowledge that many \r\ncountries carrying the label “emerging nations” are \r\ntoday, thanks to favourable market conditions, flush \r\nwith cash and have, according to informed sources, \r\nestablished what is known as sovereign wealth funds \r\ntotalling more than $3 trillion that dwarf the aid \r\nbudgets of the World Bank, IMF and Western nations.  \r\n Some of these nations, particularly some Arab \r\nGulf States, have poured investments into developing \r\ncountries ranging from Djibouti, to Senegal, to \r\nSouth Africa and to Rwanda and the Comoros to the \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 22 \r\n \r\ntune of billions of dollars. Many countries, including \r\nmy own, acknowledge such investments, and, in my \r\ncountry in particular, more than $1 billion are in the \r\npipeline, thus helping us towards the realization of our \r\ndream to become a regional hub, not to mention the \r\nfact of the positive impact such investments will have \r\nin the attainment of the MDGs.  \r\n These new sources of direct investments need our \r\nencouragement, and we should be careful not to \r\npressure such sources in ways that will inhibit this \r\ninvestment, for example by insisting on the adoption of \r\nburdensome practices and procedures that are not, as \r\nwe all know, quite helpful in poverty reduction. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Peter Moors, \r\nDirector-General for Developmental Cooperation, of \r\nBelgium. \r\n Mr. Moors (Belgium): Let me at the outset \r\nexpress Belgium’s alignment with the statement made \r\nby Portugal on behalf of the European Union.  \r\n My statement today will be limited to four points: \r\nprogress made since the Monterrey Consensus, the \r\nneed to focus on countries that are missing out on \r\nrecent economic growth, the need for coordination and \r\nharmonization in the ever expanding and complex aid \r\narchitecture and mobilization of domestic resources.  \r\n Let me first start with the good news. In many \r\nrespects the Consensus reached at Monterrey in 2002 \r\nhas been the basis for substantive progress and \r\nsuccesses. Let me provide just a few examples: a \r\nconsiderable and growing number of countries have \r\nbeen able to use international trade as an engine for \r\nstrong economic growth. The primacy of country \r\nownership is now generally accepted; this must be the \r\nbasis for a growing drive towards alignment and \r\nharmonization. The importance of good governance \r\nhas become widely recognized. Overall, the debt \r\nsituation has greatly improved. In the field of technical \r\nand financial cooperation, a number of new initiatives \r\nand new actors, both private and public, have joined \r\nthe global effort. Most importantly, overall economic \r\ngrowth has been unprecedented.  \r\n This brings me to my second point. Today, the \r\nlarge majority of people in the so-called third world \r\nlive in countries that have recently seen remarkable \r\ngrowth rates and substantial improvement in living \r\nstandards. There is every reason to believe that, given \r\nthe right international context, these countries will be \r\nable to continue with this promising trend and thus \r\nnarrow the gap.  \r\n The real challenge of the coming years, however, \r\nis the dreadful condition of a number of countries that \r\nhave not partaken in this fortunate evolution. Most of \r\nthese countries are in Africa; many of them are in a \r\ndisadvantaged situation; often they are small, \r\nlandlocked or both; often they are in conflict or post-\r\nconflict situations; often their institutional governance \r\nis weak and fragile. There is a high probability that \r\nthese countries will not be able to catch up without \r\nsubstantial support and assistance from the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n Therefore, I think that this group of countries \r\nshould be the focus of the Monterrey review process \r\nleading to Doha. All Member States and all relevant \r\npartners should take part in the reflection on what can \r\nbe done to raise these countries from the poverty trap.  \r\n With my third point, I want to go back to what I \r\nsaid earlier about the many new initiatives and non-\r\ntraditional actors, private and public, that have joined \r\nthe global effort of providing technical and financial \r\ninternational cooperation. We can only commend that \r\nevolution. The needs are huge, and any help is \r\nwelcome, but the proliferation of actors is not without \r\nrisks — the larger the number of players, the larger the \r\nneed for coordination and harmonization. One of the \r\nobjectives of the Monterrey review process should be \r\nto bring all actors together behind a limited number of \r\nfundamental principles. In my mind, those principles \r\nare the primacy of country ownership, alignment with \r\nnational strategies, harmonization of processes and \r\nuntying of aid. \r\n Finally, I want to say a word about the first pillar \r\nof the Monterrey Consensus — the mobilization of \r\ndomestic resources. For a resource mobilization \r\nstrategy to be effective, it needs two things: a proper \r\nresource allocation mechanism and a functioning \r\nresource management system. We have to strengthen \r\nour efforts to increase the efficiency of public sector \r\nmanagement and its effects on income distribution. \r\n In that context, I would like to emphasize the \r\nissue of the proceeds of natural resources. The \r\nrelationship between natural resources and conflict was \r\nthe theme of a Security Council thematic debate under \r\nthe Belgian presidency in June this year. It is true that, \r\nall too often, natural resources have fuelled armed \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n23 07-56101 \r\n \r\nconflicts, but if well managed, the revenues of natural \r\nresources can also be a massive source of finance for \r\ndevelopment. That is a shared responsibility of \r\nGovernments and international partners. We should \r\nlook together into ways of increasing the quality and \r\ntransparency of contracts related to natural resources. \r\nWe should work for global codes of conduct and \r\nevolve from voluntary mechanisms towards a binding \r\nset of international standards. \r\n To sum up, I want to make a triple appeal. First, \r\nlet us focus on the poorest countries that desperately \r\nneed our help. Secondly, let us make sure that all actors \r\nare behind the principles of Monterrey. Thirdly, let us \r\nmake sure that the proceeds of natural resources are \r\nused in a way that is conducive to development. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give \r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Liu Zhenmin, chairman \r\nof the delegation of China. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Pakistan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. We wish to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on financing for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Financing for development is an issue that \r\nconcerns the international community as a whole. As \r\nagreed in the Monterrey Consensus, developing and \r\ndeveloped countries should establish a new \r\npartnership, take comprehensive measures domestically \r\nand internationally, enhance policy continuity and \r\nconsistency, and mobilize capital from all channels to \r\npromote common development. The Chinese \r\ndelegation hopes that this High-level Dialogue will \r\ngive new impetus to the financing for development \r\nprocess. \r\n Over the past two years, stakeholders have gained \r\na deeper understanding of the policies and means \r\nconcerning financing for development. Nevertheless, \r\nthere still exists a huge financial gap if poverty is to be \r\neradicated and the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), are to be achieved. Private investment has \r\nbypassed many poor countries that are in greatest need \r\nof capital. Official development assistance (ODA) fell \r\nbetween 2005 and 2006. New manifestations of trade \r\nprotectionism have emerged, plunging the exports of \r\nmany developing countries, especially the least \r\ndeveloped countries, into grave difficulties. \r\n As poverty and underdevelopment are suffered \r\nmainly by developing countries, the most difficult part \r\nof financing for development is to mobilize funds on \r\ntheir behalf. The biggest obstacle to financing for \r\ndevelopment is the innate deficiency suffered by \r\ndeveloping countries due to their long-term \r\nbackwardness. In the light of that situation, the \r\ninternational community should intervene \r\nconstructively, rather than rely solely on market forces. \r\nOn the one hand, it needs to provide financial \r\nassistance to help developing countries resolve the \r\npressing issue of development; on the other, it should \r\ncreate a favourable external environment for \r\ndeveloping countries to build their capacity for \r\nmobilizing funds through their own efforts. The \r\nChinese delegation believes that the following aspects \r\nshould command our particular attention in the \r\nforthcoming dialogue. \r\n First, we should encourage and support capacity-\r\nbuilding by developing countries themselves. \r\nInternational institutions and donor countries should \r\ntake the needs of recipient countries into account when \r\nthey provide technical assistance to support developing \r\ncountries in reforming economic and financial systems, \r\nenhancing the rule of law, eliminating corruption and \r\nestablishing public-private partnerships. Policy space is \r\nneeded in that regard to reflect the demand of \r\ndeveloping countries to identify and implement \r\ndevelopment strategies based on their own priorities. \r\n Secondly, we should increase ODA. We hope that \r\nthe developed countries will heed the voice of the vast \r\nnumber of developing countries and take concrete \r\nmeasures to honour their commitments to increasing \r\nODA so as to ensure that, apart from debt reduction \r\nand emergency humanitarian assistance, more financial \r\nresources flow to developing countries, and that the \r\ngoal of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national \r\nincome to ODA will be achieved. \r\n Thirdly, we must give full play to the role of \r\ntrade as the engine of development. The international \r\ncommunity should ensure that the multilateral trading \r\nregime is open, fair, non-discriminatory and rule-\r\nbased. Concrete and effective measures need to be \r\ntaken to help increase the competitiveness of \r\ndeveloping countries and give play to their \r\ncomparative advantages. It is our hope that the Doha \r\nRound of negotiations will achieve its goal as a \r\ndevelopment round, effectively address the concerns of \r\ndeveloping countries, and come to an early conclusion. \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 24 \r\n \r\n Fourthly, we have to address new problems and \r\nguard against financial risks. Recent years have \r\nwitnessed the rise of greater imbalances in the global \r\neconomy and increasing complexity and \r\nunpredictability in the financial markets. Countries and \r\nthe international organizations concerned should make \r\nconcerted efforts to better manage the flow of \r\ninternational capital and prevent and fend off financial \r\nrisks so as to ensure a stable environment conducive to \r\nglobal development. \r\n Fifthly, we should promote the reform of the \r\ninternational financial architecture. The reform of the \r\ninternational financial regime should reflect the \r\nchanges in the international economic landscape by \r\ntaking full account of the actual needs of developing \r\ncountries and increasing their voice and representation. \r\n The Chinese Government has adopted reform and \r\nopening-up as a fundamental national policy. We will \r\ncontinue to improve macroeconomic regulation, firmly \r\npush ahead with the reform of the financial system, and \r\ngive full play to the potential of domestic savings and \r\ninvestment. At the same time, we will create an \r\nenabling environment for attracting foreign investment, \r\nimprove our capacity to address financial risks, and \r\nmaintain the sustained and rapid development of the \r\neconomy. \r\n As a developing country, China — apart from \r\naddressing its own difficulties in financing for \r\ndevelopment — has done what it can to provide \r\nassistance to other developing countries in such \r\ndiversified forms as debt relief, trade preferences, \r\ninfrastructure development, productive investment and \r\neconomic exchanges. Our aim is to help them increase \r\ntheir capacity for sustainable development and achieve \r\ncommon progress. The Chinese Government will \r\ncontinue to strengthen consultations and share best \r\npractices in financing for development with all parties \r\nconcerned so as to deepen mutually beneficial \r\ncooperation and promote common development. \r\n The Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development will be held in Doha next \r\nyear. It will be an important opportunity for us to \r\ncomprehensively review the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and discuss ways to further \r\nstrengthen cooperation. We hope that the parties \r\nconcerned will conduct pragmatic discussions in the \r\nlight of the current situation and push for substantive \r\nprogress in international cooperation on financing for \r\ndevelopment, so as to contribute to poverty eradication \r\nand common development. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jean-Marc \r\nHoscheit, chairman of the delegation of Luxembourg. \r\n Mr. Hoscheit (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nLet me say at the outset that Luxembourg fully aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nPortugal on behalf of the European Union.  \r\n The coming year is crucial in terms of \r\ndevelopment. It will be necessary to handle, \r\nsimultaneously, and in a convergent manner, the World \r\nTrade Organization trade negotiations, the follow-up to \r\nthe Monterrey Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the implementation of the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness.  \r\n The leaders meeting to be convened in 2008 in \r\nthe framework of the General Assembly for a midterm \r\nreview of the Millennium Development Goals will \r\ncertainly be a good opportunity to take stock of where \r\nwe stand and to reinvigorate our efforts. It seems \r\nessential that, in general, questions of development and \r\ndevelopment cooperation be addressed in both their \r\nquantitative and qualitative aspects. Today’s debate is \r\nan opportunity to take stock of advances and progress, \r\nof obstacles and constraints, and also of new \r\npossibilities for partnership between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Since the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nwe have seen considerable progress in certain areas and \r\nin certain regions. We are pleased that the downward \r\ntrend in official development assistance (ODA) was \r\nreversed in 2005, including by a strong and \r\nunprecedented commitment by the European Union \r\nand its member States which, since, have mobilized \r\n57 per cent of worldwide ODA. \r\n Despite this progress, however, the picture of the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus remains, \r\nunfortunately, mixed. Alongside the progress, we must \r\nalso note stagnation, and even regression. However, the \r\ncurrent international economic situation should make \r\npossible bold efforts at the national and international \r\nlevels.  \r\n Acting upon the concrete recommendations \r\nfound, in particular, in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/62/217) should help us to implement in a \r\nbalanced way the six major thematic areas of the \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n25 07-56101 \r\n \r\nMonterrey Consensus. I shall focus my statement on \r\nthree of them: mobilizing of financial resources for \r\ndevelopment, both domestic and international; and \r\ninternational trade as an engine for development.  \r\n First, regarding mobilizing domestic financial \r\nresources for development, we can see that, overall, \r\nmacroeconomic policies in developing countries have \r\nimproved over the past 20 years. The Monterrey \r\nConsensus states clearly that each country has primary \r\nresponsibility for its own economic and social \r\ndevelopment. In this context, I should like to \r\nemphasize the importance of good governance, sound \r\neconomic policies, viable development strategies, \r\nconcerted efforts at mobilizing national resources and \r\nimproving the efficiency of public expenditures and the \r\ncreation of a stable, transparent and predictable \r\ninvestment climate. \r\n Good governance also makes it possible to \r\nachieve better development outcomes. That implies a \r\npermanent and structured internal political dialogue, \r\nnotably on the questions of human rights, democracy, \r\nthe rule of law and the fight against corruption. In \r\naddition to this internal dialogue, there should also be a \r\nfruitful dialogue between donor and recipient partners. \r\nFor our part, we stand ready, with our partners in the \r\nSouth, to support these actions with financial and \r\ntechnical support adapted to local circumstances. \r\n Secondly, on mobilizing international resources \r\nfor development, I would like first to recall that my \r\nGovernment has undertaken to raise the Grand Duchy’s \r\nODA to 1 per cent of gross national income (GNI) over \r\nthe next few years. Our ODA reached almost \r\n0.9 per cent in 2006 while we pursued, in parallel, our \r\nefforts to improve the effectiveness and the quality of \r\nthe assistance. \r\n Luxembourg has actively participated in defining \r\nthe quantitative and qualitative standards which the \r\nEuropean Union endorsed in the first half of 2005. \r\nFurthermore, under the Luxembourg presidency, the \r\nEuropean Union marked out the path to meet those \r\nstandards and, for the first time, the States members of \r\nthe expanded European Union collectively undertook \r\nto raise ODA to 0.7 per cent of GNI by 2015. Thus, the \r\nEuropean Union is on the right path for fulfilling its \r\nMonterrey commitments. In 2006, it devoted \r\n0.42 per cent of GNI to development efforts. \r\n The ODA of the countries of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, overall, fell \r\nby 5.1 per cent in 2006. That development is disturbing \r\nbecause, if it continues, it will not be possible for us to \r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by \r\n2015. \r\n Since 2002, other methods for mobilizing \r\nadditional resources for development have been \r\nexplored and developed, including what are known as \r\ninnovative sources of finance. These are thoroughly \r\npraiseworthy efforts, but they cannot be a substitute for \r\nODA, which remains central to our global partnership \r\nfor development. \r\n Thirdly, I would like to discuss international trade \r\nas an engine for development. It should be emphasized \r\nthat the Monterrey Consensus and the Millennium \r\nDeclaration identify international trade as a key engine \r\nfor growth and development. To take up the challenge \r\nof development so that trade becomes a source of \r\ngrowth, resources and tax revenues, developing \r\ncountries must find their place in the context of \r\ninternational trade and intelligently integrate their \r\neconomic activities in that context. Success in the \r\nframework in the Doha Round of negotiations requires \r\nefforts by all — developing, emerging and developed \r\ncountries alike. \r\n Controlled globalization must be oriented \r\ntowards an economic development that truly integrates \r\nsocial and environmental dimensions — in other \r\nwords, towards what we call sustainable development. \r\nThe participation of developing countries in world \r\ntrade requires a strengthening of their institutions and \r\ncapacities to adapt their regulatory frameworks, as well \r\nas the establishment of a sound fiscal base in order to \r\nstimulate economic growth. It also requires good \r\neconomic governance, development of the private \r\nsector, capacities and educational systems, and a \r\nsignificant improvement in transport and energy \r\ninfrastructures. \r\n We are confident that these two days will make it \r\npossible for us to gather many views and to come \r\ntogether in a constructive spirit in order to prepare, in a \r\nfruitful manner, our important meetings in 2008. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Abdulrahman Al \r\nMufadhi, chairman of the delegation of Saudi Arabia. \r\n Mr. Al Mufadhi (Saudi Arabia): At the outset, let \r\nme welcome this opportunity to take stock of the status \r\nof implementation and the tasks ahead under the \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 26 \r\n \r\nMonterrey Consensus of 2002. The overall picture is, \r\nindeed, one of considerable progress in poverty \r\neradication and sustained development. Poverty levels \r\nhave declined substantially, and developing countries, \r\nas a group, are now an increasingly important source of \r\nglobal growth. \r\n However, as we can all see, and agree, the overall \r\npicture can be misleading. The outcomes remain \r\nmixed, as marked progress, especially in the larger \r\ncountries of Asia, has been accompanied by modest \r\ngrowth, stagnation or decline in other regions, \r\nparticularly in Africa. Many of the least developed and \r\nfragile economies, particularly those recently or still in \r\nthe midst of conflict, are actually registering an \r\nincrease in poverty and inequality. Even the better-\r\nperforming countries such as China and India have \r\nlarge-scale poverty that remains to be addressed. \r\nHelping the lagging countries eradicate poverty and \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals towards \r\nsustained, equitable and inclusive development is \r\nclearly our collective obligation. That puts the \r\nspotlight, once again, on the key themes in financing \r\nfor development highlighted in the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. \r\n It is worth taking time to assess where we stand \r\nnow on the agreed spectrum of actions. On domestic \r\nresource mobilization, progress has been substantial in \r\nthe wake of widespread macroeconomic improvements \r\nas well as ongoing structural reforms conducive to \r\nsustained public and private investment for growth. \r\nSuccess in promoting a business-friendly environment \r\nhas been central to the rising role of private \r\ninvestment, domestic as well as foreign, that is evident \r\nin those developing countries that are experiencing \r\nfaster poverty reduction and growth. \r\n The key to further success is in vigorous private \r\ninvestment, facilitated by public sector investment as \r\nneeded, to develop the requisite physical, institutional \r\nand financial infrastructure with a view to enhancing \r\ncompetitiveness. The importance of continued \r\nvigilance for sustained macroeconomic prudence and \r\nstructural reform is further underscored by the need to \r\nattract and preserve investor confidence, especially in \r\nthe current context of increased uncertainties in \r\nfinancial markets after an extended period of rapid \r\ngrowth in both portfolio and direct private investment \r\ninflows into the developing countries. \r\n Clearly, while business-conducive domestic \r\npolicies are indispensable for poverty reduction and \r\ngrowth, success presupposes dynamism of trade, which \r\nwas rightly identified at Monterrey as a leading \r\nactionable theme. The proven efficacy of trade requires \r\nus to again highlight the current disappointing state of \r\nthe negotiations for further liberalization under the \r\nDoha Round. Of course, success here would require \r\nstrong proactive policies in industrial countries to \r\ndismantle trade-distorting farm subsidies and barriers \r\nto imports of developing countries’ products.  \r\n Meanwhile, the increased focus on aid for trade is \r\nwelcome to help fill the large gaps in the trading \r\ninfrastructure, especially of the low-income countries, \r\nwhich have in fact witnessed a decline in their \r\ncollective share of the still rapidly expanding volume \r\nof global trade. As regards the proliferation of regional \r\nand bilateral trade agreements, that is one more signal \r\nthat success in the Doha Round is critical for ensuring \r\norderly global economic integration consistent with the \r\nmultilateral trading system as embodied in the World \r\nTrade Organization. \r\n Turning to the theme of international financial \r\nand technical cooperation, it is disappointing that the \r\nshare of gross national income (GNI) for official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) dipped again, to reach \r\n0.3 per cent in 2006 following a marginal rise to \r\n0.33 per cent in 2005, after a drop to as low as 0.2 per \r\ncent in 2002. ODA thus remains well below the level \r\nneeded to reach the MDGs, as agreed, by 2015 — not \r\nto mention the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent. \r\n It should also be noted here that over the years \r\nSaudi Arabia has consistently exceeded the United \r\nNations target for ODA by a wide margin. Given the \r\nagreed goals for poverty reduction and growth, the \r\ndonor community needs to be more ambitious in \r\nsetting the aid volume going forward. For efforts of the \r\ndeveloping countries to bear fruit, it is imperative that \r\naid levels be scaled up and made more predictable and \r\nstable as well as better aligned with the beneficiary \r\ncountries’ own strategies, planning horizons and \r\nabsorptive capacity. Focus on increased effectiveness \r\nof aid is especially important in view of the still \r\nrelatively low levels of ODA. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus emphasis on orderly \r\ndebt relief was premised on adding fiscal space for \r\ndevelopment financing. That certainly is not a one-off \r\ntask, since ongoing attention is necessary for ensuring \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n27 07-56101 \r\n \r\na virtuous circle of sustained growth and the resulting \r\nexpansion of policy space to help avoid debt distress. \r\nI also agree that a well-coordinated debt-management \r\neffort is needed to ensure the efficient management of \r\ndebt maturity and currency profiles. \r\n Here, I draw attention to the urgency of ensuring \r\nthe additionality of financing for development. As an \r\nexample, I would note here the importance of a full \r\nreplenishment of the loss of repayment reflows for the \r\nInternational Development Association following debt \r\ncancellations under the Multilateral Debt Reduction \r\nInitiative. \r\n On systemic issues, I welcome ongoing efforts \r\npromoting the coherence and consistency of global \r\nmonetary, financial and trading systems. I remain \r\nsupportive of the goal of enhanced participation for \r\ndeveloping and transition countries in decision-making \r\nat the International Monetary Fund and the World \r\nBank, as envisaged under the Monterrey Consensus. \r\nThis, of course, is an issue awaiting consensus for \r\nconstructive action. I also encourage full use of the \r\navailable scope for enhanced collaboration between the \r\nBank and the Fund in line with their respective \r\ninstitutional mandates and comparative advantages. \r\n Before I conclude, I wish to add a word on the \r\nspecial problems facing least developed countries \r\nemerging from conflict. I share the view that success in \r\nachieving the agreed poverty-reduction and growth \r\ngoals would go a long way towards reducing the risk of \r\nconflict. To that end, the international community \r\nneeds to be proactive on what could be termed \r\npre-conflict situations rather than delaying engagement \r\nuntil a conflict begins or ceases. \r\n Finally, containment of geopolitical tensions and \r\na generally supportive regional and international \r\nenvironment are crucial for sustained poverty reduction \r\nand robust growth.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Gilles Noghès, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Monaco. \r\n Mr. Noghès (Monaco) (spoke in French): Since \r\nthe adoption of the Monterrey Consensus at the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, Monaco’s contribution to official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) has continued to grow. \r\nSpecifically, since 2003 that contribution has increased \r\nby more than 25 per cent each year. The Principality \r\nGovernment is thus positioning itself to gradually \r\nreach the objective of 0.7 per cent of Monaco’s gross \r\nnational income (GNI) devoted to official development \r\nassistance by 2015. \r\n The major areas for Monaco’s cooperation — \r\nwhether technical or financial — are part of the \r\nframework of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs): combating poverty, promoting education, \r\ndeveloping primary health care systems, combating \r\npandemics and promoting environmental protection in \r\nthe broadest sense. \r\n Like all stakeholders in the Monterrey Consensus \r\nwho have undertaken to ensure the implementation of \r\nthat partnership, my Government intends to assume its \r\nresponsibilities and to come to the assistance of the \r\nmost disadvantaged and the most vulnerable. In \r\naddition, our cooperation policy is aimed chiefly at \r\nimproving the living conditions of women and children \r\nin certain countries. This is a cross-cutting approach \r\nthat we are working to implement with the active \r\ncontribution of many non-governmental organizations \r\nin the Principality or present in the target countries. \r\nFrom that angle, the Government attaches importance \r\nto action on the ground whose development and \r\noutcomes it can measure. \r\n In addition its voluntary contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations and to several organizations and \r\ninstitutions such as UNESCO, the World Health \r\nOrganization, the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS, UNICEF, the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees, cooperation funding is \r\nalso used to benefit bilateral cooperation. The \r\nGovernment thus decided to allocate, beginning in \r\n2008, a line of credit of €250,000 per year to \r\nmicrofinance institutions with the goal of building \r\ncapacity in developing countries on the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n Development financing is at the heart of our \r\npriorities at the sixty-second session. We are convinced \r\nthat the positioning will be decisive in the light of the \r\npreparations for the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development planned for \r\nDoha in 2008, to which my delegation — I can assure \r\nthe Assembly — will give its full support. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency, Ms. Marisol Argueta \r\nde Barillas, chair of the delegation of El Salvador. \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 28 \r\n \r\n Ms. Argueta (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): El \r\nSalvador confirms its commitment under the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, and in this context we endorse \r\nthe position presented by representative of Chile \r\nspeaking on behalf of the Rio Group, and that of \r\nPakistan speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina.  \r\n Without doubt the main responsibility for their \r\nown economic and social development lies with the \r\ncountries themselves. We therefore acknowledge the \r\nimportance of continuing the mobilization of domestic \r\nresources in the implementation of development plans, \r\nemphasizing growth and the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \r\nincreasing investment in programmes for education and \r\nin the better use of science and technology for \r\nmeaningful progress along the path towards \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n We attach equal importance to adequate \r\ndistribution of domestic resources and implementation \r\nof appropriate fiscal policies in order to achieve better \r\nsocial cohesion, as well as the strengthening of \r\ndemocratic institutions, the consolidation of the rule of \r\nlaw and the adoption of transparency patterns in public \r\nadministration in order to build solid bases for truly \r\nsustainable development. \r\n We must consider that many countries continue to \r\nbe vulnerable to external conditions, such as the trends \r\ntoward slowing down of larger developed economies \r\nand the volatility of financial and commodity markets \r\nat the international level. My delegation believes that it \r\nis essential to conclude the Doha Round with fair and \r\nequitable results and with the application of aid for \r\ntrade and foreign direct investment initiatives, \r\nrecognizing the contribution of the private sector in the \r\ndevelopment process.  \r\n Many countries are faced with new opportunities \r\nand new challenges resulting from globalization, which \r\nhas provoked as one of its effects the intensification of \r\ninternational emigration, which is accompanied by the \r\nmobilization of a significant flow of resources through \r\nfamily remittances. In many countries, remittances \r\nhave replaced the main traditional sources of income. \r\nWhile those resources are unquestionably private, all \r\npossible efforts have to be undertaken to reduce the \r\ncost of those transfers and to encourage a productive \r\nuse of the resources so that they contribute to the \r\nnational goals for development and social well-being.  \r\n We also believe that to accelerate progress and \r\nthe research of its impact, national initiatives for \r\ndevelopment should fit within an international \r\nframework of solidarity that would facilitate the \r\nachievement of globally shared objectives. For this, we \r\nwould like to stress the role of official development \r\nassistance (ODA) and, in particular, the situation \r\nfacing middle-income countries within the system of \r\ninternational cooperation, which have experienced, in \r\nrecent years, a marked decrease in international \r\ndevelopment cooperation.  \r\n Together, middle-income countries number 92, \r\nwith per capita income ranging between approximately \r\n$840 and $9,400. Within this group, 47 per cent of the \r\nworld’s population is concentrated, with more than \r\n41 per cent living under the poverty-line income of \r\n$2 a day. Many of these countries are highly unstable \r\nin terms of economic growth and face a high degree of \r\nenvironmental and geographic vulnerability, with a \r\nhigh recurrence of natural disasters that makes it more \r\nand more difficult to achieve continuous, stable \r\nprogress.  \r\n Moreover, this group of developing countries is \r\nvery heterogeneous, so continuous allocation of \r\ninternational resources should be an adequate \r\nreflection of this diversity without affecting \r\ncooperation that reasonably is assigned as a priority to \r\nleast developed countries. We call upon the \r\ninternational community and the United Nations \r\nsystem to implement new and innovative mechanisms \r\nto provide middle-income countries more clearly \r\nfocused cooperation in accordance with needs and \r\ndemands as a complement to their national efforts in \r\ncombating poverty, in the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and in the \r\nconsolidation of their progress in economic and social \r\ndevelopment, and in peacebuilding in countries that \r\nhave suffered from conflict. \r\n We would also like to stress the more active role \r\nthat South-South cooperation should play, as a \r\ncomplement to North-South cooperation, in order to \r\nestablish closer links for cooperation both among \r\nmiddle-income countries and between those countries \r\nand low-income countries. That can also be done \r\nthrough triangular cooperation when the financial \r\nparticipation of a developed country is involved. \r\n On debt relief, my delegation would like to stress \r\nnot only the strengthening of regional financial \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n29 07-56101 \r\n \r\narrangements for this purpose but also the application \r\nof the proposals analysed in the Paris Club for debt \r\ncancellation, in exchange for social spending on \r\nprojects linked to attaining the MDGs and on projects \r\nfor the protection of the environment. \r\n We would especially like to stress the initiative of \r\nthe Government of Spain in organizing the first \r\nIntergovernmental Conference on Middle-Income \r\nCountries. Following that conference, El Salvador was \r\nhost, a few weeks ago, to the Second International \r\nConference on the same subject. We had an extensive \r\nattendance of more than 67 delegations, and the El \r\nSalvador Consensus was adopted unanimously. This \r\ndocument covered the main aspects related to \r\ninternational cooperation with middle-income \r\ncountries, with the basic objective of raising awareness \r\nin the international community as to the importance of \r\ngiving support to such countries in their endeavours to \r\nadvance further in their development. The consensus \r\nalso contains a commitment to place this topic on the \r\nagenda of international organizations and financial \r\ninstitutions.  \r\n To that end, we have called upon the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to circulate the El Salvador Consensus as an \r\nofficial document. We are grateful to the reference to \r\nthe Conference in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/62/217).  \r\n Similarly, we believe that the preparatory process \r\nfor the Doha Round of 2008 is suitable for establishing \r\na mandate to the Secretary-General so that he can \r\nsupport what is relevant in the development of the \r\ntopic of development cooperation with middle-income \r\ncountries so that this topic can be strengthened on the \r\nDoha agenda. We would also be grateful if it could be \r\nreflected in the President’s summary of this High-level \r\nDialogue.  \r\n Before concluding, I would like to recall that, \r\nfirst and foremost, development efforts must have \r\nhuman meaning. Therefore, we cannot forget that \r\nwomen represent over 51 per cent of the world \r\npopulation; we have to strengthen our commitment to \r\ngender mainstreaming in the treatment of this question \r\nacross the board.  \r\n Finally, we would like to place our confidence in \r\nand offer our support to the two facilitators of this \r\nprocess. We would also like to stress the imminent \r\nneed to establish an ad hoc follow-up mechanism to \r\nassure a more systematic and permanent focus on the \r\nimportant question of financing for development, in \r\nwhich, as developed countries and developing \r\ncountries alike, we must assume the co-responsibility \r\nthat is ours. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency, Mr. Jorge Voto-\r\nBernales, chairman of the delegation of Peru. \r\n Mr. Voto-Bernales (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation would like to endorse what was said by \r\nthe Minister of Economic Affairs of Pakistan, speaking \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, as well as the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Chile speaking \r\non behalf of the Rio Group. \r\n My country would like to reaffirm that the \r\nchallenge is to revitalize multilateral cooperation, so as \r\nto allow developing countries to benefit from available \r\nfinancial resources and establish partnerships with the \r\nprivate sector, bilateral sources and non-governmental \r\norganizations. \r\n We acknowledge that national resources will \r\nremain the main source of financing of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, in consonance with the principle \r\nestablished in Monterrey that each country has the \r\nprimary responsibility for its own development. At the \r\nsame time, we believe that public and private resources \r\nat the international level remain crucial. \r\n Thus, we must stress the need to establish an \r\nadequate balance between the market and public \r\ninterest, through joint initiatives, the public and private \r\nsectors that allow the combining of market \r\ninnovations, social responsibility and adequate \r\nregulation. \r\n It is important to concentrate on the application \r\nof an effective operational strategy, so as to seek \r\ngreater official development assistance (ODA) over \r\nand above the contributions offered in Monterrey for \r\nsustainable development and environmental protection \r\nand for investments in education, innovation, science \r\nand technology. For this purpose, we should, first, \r\nemphasize new instruments being conceived to \r\nreactivate the exchange of debt for investment in \r\neducation, technology and innovation, to turn these \r\ninto viable instruments to foster development, in \r\nparticular in the case of middle-income countries; \r\nsecondly, support communities and local and national \r\nGovernments to facilitate access and equal conditions \r\nto the innovative mechanisms for funding; and thirdly, \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 30 \r\n \r\nidentify the form for foreign investment needed to \r\nprovide a greater contribution to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and technology transfer. \r\n We should also stress the need to seek a point of \r\nconvergence for United Nations efforts with the \r\nBretton Woods institutions, the World Trade \r\nOrganization, the private sector and civil society. \r\nEqually, we should strengthen the spirit of association \r\nbetween industrialized countries and developing \r\ncountries in seeking broad consensus to revitalize the \r\nNorth-South dialogue and set a road map for the global \r\nareas of the Monterrey Consensus, in particular, first, \r\ndomestic policy, strengthening the domestic financial \r\nsystem, having it become more inclusive, financing of \r\nsmall and medium-sized undertakings, actions for \r\ngenerating greater equity; secondly, mobilization of \r\ninternational flows, a greater benefit from foreign \r\ndirect investment through association with local \r\ncapital, private investments focusing on infrastructure \r\nand financial movement between South-South \r\ncountries; thirdly, international trade, where there is an \r\nurgent need for finalization of the Doha Round, in \r\nterms consistent with the promotion of development, as \r\nwell as the immediate implementation of the results. As \r\nto official development assistance, there should be \r\nlesser conditionality, as well as transaction costs. \r\n We need to debate the inclusion of middle-\r\nincome countries on the agenda of international \r\ncooperation. I feel this should be clear; this should not \r\nbe taken as competition in a fight to obtain funds with \r\ncountries that are poorer than our own. We would like \r\nto back Mexico’s position here, that remittances should \r\nbe considered as strictly private flows for nuclear \r\nfamily units, essentially for their own use, not to be \r\nseen as a boost to long-term development. \r\n Finally, I would like to underscore two elements \r\nthat are of importance in our view. First, for Peru, trade \r\nis the main source of economic dynamism, fostering \r\ninvestments with greater employment, consumption \r\nand tax revenue. It thus creates new resources for \r\ndevelopment funding. For that reason, our country has \r\nincluded trade as a fundamental part of our strategy to \r\nfight poverty. We have also thus initiated an extensive \r\nstrategy for the negotiation of free trade treaties on a \r\nbilateral basis. \r\n In addition, we would like to stress the urgency \r\nof reactivation of the Doha Round to achieve open \r\ntrade, based on non-discriminatory, equitable rules. It \r\nis important to improve and have more predictable \r\naccess to all markets for all products and services of \r\ndeveloping countries. Technical assistance, as “Aid for \r\nTrade”, to strengthen exportable goods, often limited in \r\ndeveloping countries, is a fundamental variable that \r\nshould be taken into account and that should be seen as \r\ncomprehensive, looking not only at production \r\ncapacities, but also at improvement of infrastructure as \r\ntrade support and at programmes for social protection \r\nand adjustment. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to Ambassador Rodrigo Malmierca Díaz, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Malmierca Díaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Cuba would like to align itself with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Pakistan, \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We would also \r\nlike to make some comments on this issue, which we \r\ndeem highly relevant and important for the developing \r\ncountries. \r\n At a time when we are getting ready for the \r\nupcoming International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, to be held next year in Doha, Qatar, this \r\ndialogue becomes ever more significant, for it gives us \r\nthe opportunity to identify the main challenges and \r\nobstacles related to financing for development and to \r\npromote concrete measures that will allow us to meet \r\nthe commitments and goals set out in Monterrey and in \r\nother multilateral venues related to development, \r\npoverty reduction, international cooperation and the \r\nestablishment of an equitable, just and inclusive \r\ninternational economic, commercial and financing \r\nsystem. \r\n In this regard, we must seize this opportunity to \r\ncorrectly evaluate the discussion and the way to \r\naddress the macroeconomic problems related to \r\ndevelopment, allowing us to truly tackle the dire \r\neconomic and social situation that the developing \r\nworld continues to suffer today. \r\n Five years after the adoption of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, our delegation continues to be very \r\ndiscouraged at how long-lasting solutions to the issues \r\naddressed by the Consensus, such as official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), external debt, foreign \r\ndirect investment (FDI) and international trade, \r\ncontinue to be but a pipe-dream. Financing for \r\ndevelopment continues to be the ultimate outstanding \r\nitem of the international agenda. It is evident that the \r\n A/62/PV.33\r\n \r\n31 07-56101 \r\n \r\nspirit of Monterrey has not been enough to provide the \r\ndeveloping countries with the resources they so badly \r\nneed to realize their right to development. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus acknowledged the \r\nneed to increase stable and predictable financial flows \r\ntowards developing countries, as the key condition to \r\nachieve their economic growth. However, despite all \r\nthe promises made, the amount of official development \r\nassistance last year only accounted for 0.3 per cent of \r\nthe developed countries’ gross domestic product \r\n(GDP), which meant a decrease of 5.1 per cent in real \r\nterms compared to 2005. \r\n Nevertheless, annual military expenditures are \r\nmore than one trillion dollars. With only 10 per cent of \r\nthe resources invested in military expenditures, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals could be reached. An \r\nestimated $150 billion a year are necessary to reach \r\nthose Goals. \r\n The figures prove that developing countries \r\ncontinue to be net issuers of financial resources to the \r\nrich and industrialized world. Since the year 2000, the \r\nnet transfer of resources from the poor countries to the \r\ndeveloped world has more than tripled. Last year \r\nalone, it reached a record $650 billion. The question of \r\nwho finances whom is even more relevant today.  \r\n Therefore, Cuba considers it important to \r\nestablish a mechanism for the supervision of and \r\nfollow-up on the commitments made in matters of \r\nofficial development assistance. This would allow us to \r\nknow the progress made in this regard and would be an \r\nimportant step forward in the transparency and \r\naccountability we need when assessing the state of \r\nimplementation of our goals in matters of financing for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Similarly, we believe that it is important to seek \r\nand implement innovative sources of financing for \r\ndevelopment. Yet, we want to stress that such \r\nalternative sources of financing should by no means \r\nreplace the commitments made at the international \r\nlevel with regard to the official development assistance \r\nand other related issues, as shown in the outcome of \r\nthe Monterrey Conference and the document adopted \r\nby the rest of the major United Nations Conferences \r\nand Summits.  \r\n In the framework of exploration of that kind of \r\ninitiative, we would like to reiterate our interest in \r\ncontinuing to advance towards the implementation of \r\nproposals such as the issuing of special drawing rights, \r\na tax on financial speculation and a carbon emissions \r\ntax, for we believe these would provide specific \r\nbenefits for developing countries.  \r\n While there are some indicators that prove a \r\ncertain increase of foreign direct investment, direct \r\ninvestment flows were only concentrated on a limited \r\ngroup of developing countries in specific areas. The \r\nmore indebted poor countries continued to receive the \r\nsmallest amounts.  \r\n Foreign trade has been recognized as the driving \r\nforce behind economic growth and development, yet so \r\nfar those potential benefits have not become a reality \r\nfor many developing countries. They continue to have \r\na very small share of international trade, which \r\nincreases their marginalization in this area.  \r\n The true realization of the development \r\ndimension in international trade matters cannot be \r\nattained only through trade liberalization. Trade can \r\nonly encourage development if it is carried out bearing \r\nin mind that the different countries should receive \r\nspecial and differentiated treatment on the basis of \r\ntheir development level.  \r\n The external debt of the developing countries \r\ncontinues to grow, and the vicious circle, in which the \r\nmore you pay the more you owe, continues to \r\ncharacterize the tough reality of our countries, proving \r\nthat shy initiatives and relief measures are not enough \r\nto solve the problem of external debt.  \r\n It is time for a deep, conscientious reflection by \r\nthe entire international community about the current \r\nsituation of the developing countries as a consequence \r\nof the unjust and unequal world economic order, which \r\nhas proved untenable.  \r\n Official development assistance should be offered \r\nwithout conditions, which distort the essentially \r\nconcessionary character of the assistance and \r\nsubordinate the development needs and priorities of the \r\nrecipient countries to the donors’ interests.  \r\n The objectives and goals have been defined; \r\nhowever, in order to achieve them, it is vital that the \r\ndeveloped countries show the necessary political will \r\nand honour their commitments, so they do not become \r\ndead letters, which remain ultimately the main \r\nchallenge. \r\nA/62/PV.33  \r\n \r\n07-56101 32 \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The President in the Chair. \r\n The President: I should like to inform members \r\nthat the consideration of agenda item 50 — “The role \r\nof the United Nations in promoting a new global \r\nhuman order” — originally scheduled for Tuesday, \r\n \r\n30 October 2007, in the afternoon as the fifth item, has \r\nbeen postponed to Thursday morning, 15 November, as \r\nthe fourth item.
