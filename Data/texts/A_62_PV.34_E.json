(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Mavroyiannis \r\n(Cyprus), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 53 (continued) \r\n \r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment \r\n \r\n (b) High-level dialogue for the implementation of \r\nthe outcome of the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/62/190 and \r\nA/62/217) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/271) \r\n \r\n  Summary by the President of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council of the special high-level meeting \r\nof the Council with the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization and \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment (New York, 16 April 2007) \r\n(A/62/76 and A/62/76/Corr.1) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, chairman \r\nof the delegation of Qatar. \r\n Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to participate in this High-level \r\nDialogue held in the framework of the follow-up to the \r\nprogress made in the outcome of the decisions of the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, held in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2002. \r\n As the Assembly is aware, the Conference was a \r\nmilestone in international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment, both in terms of the substantive goals \r\nthat had been set and their method of collective action \r\nthat included all partners, from Governments to \r\ninternational financial, monetary and trade institutions, \r\nas well as representatives of civil society and the \r\nprivate sector. World leaders agreed at the Monterrey \r\nsummit to intensify efforts and mobilize capacities to \r\nfurther development efforts and to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Today, five years after the Monterrey Conference, \r\nwe find that the balance sheet reflects mixed results \r\nwith regard to the six themes that underpin the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. In the area of domestic resource \r\nmobilization, many developing nations have made \r\ngreat strides in the adoption of rational and sound \r\neconomic policies and good governance at all levels, to \r\nhelp ensure that resources are provided and used \r\neffectively, and in improving local efforts to finance \r\ndevelopment. In the framework of the implementation \r\nof the decisions of Monterrey, the Committee of \r\nGovernmental Experts on International Cooperation in \r\nTax Matters was created. \r\n Despite efforts by developing countries to attract \r\nflows of foreign direct investment, the inflows of such \r\ninvestments have remained uneven in terms of \r\ndistribution. In fact, few developing countries have \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 2 \r\n \r\nreceived a large share of those investments and there is \r\nstill an urgent need for those investments at the \r\ninternational and local levels. \r\n In the area of international trade, the world is still \r\nlooking forward to the successful conclusion of the \r\nDoha Round special negotiations in a manner that \r\nmeets the needs of development in the developing \r\ncountries. By hosting the Fourth Ministerial \r\nConference of the World Trade Organization we in the \r\nState of Qatar, were motivated by the will to create the \r\nopportunity for the international community to come \r\nup with a round of negotiations in which the \r\ndevelopment dimension would receive a great deal of \r\nconcern. \r\n In the area of official development assistance \r\n(ODA), Qatar commends the efforts of many \r\ndeveloping countries to implement the decisions of \r\nMonterrey and to live up to the obligations that were \r\nimposed on them by the international financial and \r\nmonetary institutions to restructure and liberalize their \r\neconomies. We urge the developed nations to honour \r\nthe obligations and commitments they took upon \r\nthemselves. The greatest possible aid should be \r\nprovided on a predictable basis. A better distribution of \r\naid should also be ensured in order to avoid the \r\nexistence of preferred and less preferred recipients of \r\ndonor aid. \r\n Development aid should be channelled wherever \r\nit can contribute to generating growth and helping \r\npeople in the long run to extricate themselves from the \r\ncycle of poverty. In that regard, we are concerned by \r\nthe decline in the amount of ODA provided in 2006. \r\n We would also like to commend the efforts of \r\nsome countries to develop new and innovative methods \r\nof financing development. We wish however to \r\nemphasize that those methods must constitute \r\nadditional sources for development and not act as a \r\nsubstitute for the fundamental commitments made by \r\nStates, especially the commitment of 0.7 per cent of \r\ngross national income. \r\n With regard to the debt issue and despite the \r\npositive results achieved through the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, there is still an \r\nurgent need for more donations and exemptions, as \r\nwell as an urgent need to develop formal frameworks \r\nfor rescheduling and relieving the debts of the poor and \r\nmiddle-income countries in a clear and transparent \r\nmanner. \r\n With regard to institutional issues, there is still a \r\ncritical requirement for action to strengthen and \r\nsupport the voice of developing countries in the \r\nmechanisms of economic decision-making at the \r\ninternational level, because the results achieved so far \r\nin that area remain short of achieving the desired \r\nexpectations. \r\n The State of Qatar has been a keen and \r\nsupportive partner of development efforts, particularly \r\nwith regard to combating poverty and sharing the \r\nbenefits of global growth in a fairer and more equitable \r\nmanner and in view of the resulting positive impacts on \r\nstability and international peace and security. The State \r\nof Qatar has hosted numerous conferences and \r\nmeetings during which my country made several \r\ninitiatives in support of those efforts. We recall, for \r\nexample, the initiative of His Highness Sheikh Hamad \r\nbin Khalifa Al-Thani, the beloved Emir of the country, \r\nto set up the South Fund for Development and \r\nHumanitarian Assistance, and his donation of \r\n$20 million to the Fund; and his initiative to donate \r\n$10 million to the United Nations Democracy Fund \r\nand to host the first Review Conference of the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, to be held in December 2008. I am \r\nlooking forward to seeing all of you in Doha at that \r\ntime. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Virgilio Marques Faria, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Angola. \r\n Mr. Marques Faria (Angola): My delegation \r\ntakes this opportunity to commend the President for \r\nconvening this high-level meeting on an important \r\nissue on the development agenda. We would like to \r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe comprehensive documentation prepared for our \r\ndiscussions. We associate ourselves with the statement \r\ndelivered by Pakistan and Benin on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and the African Group, \r\nrespectively. \r\n Financing for development is one of the crucial \r\nissues that has an enormous impact on development. \r\nThe implementation of the Monterrey Consensus is \r\ncritical to achieving the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In that regard, we would \r\nlike to stress the need to preserve and reinforce the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. As we have discussed at the \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n3 07-56108 \r\n \r\nHigh-level Dialogue in June 2005 and at the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting of the General Assembly in \r\nSeptember 2005, we are seeing encouraging signs of \r\nprogress. \r\n The pledge by the developed countries to make \r\nconcrete efforts towards achieving the target of 0.7 per \r\ncent of gross national income as official development \r\nassistance (ODA) and to pursue innovative sources of \r\nfinancing for development is appreciated. However, \r\nthere is still a lot to be done to ensure that financing for \r\ndevelopment is adequate to enable development, \r\nparticularly concerning the efforts of African countries \r\nin achieving their development aspirations. \r\n In his report (A/62/217), the Secretary-General \r\nnotes that restructuring the international financial \r\narchitecture to respond to profound changes in the \r\nglobal economy is an unfinished agenda. My \r\ndelegation supports the principle of the need to \r\nstrengthen multilateral consultations on various aspects \r\nof the international system, particularly the issue of a \r\ngreater voice and increased participation for \r\ndeveloping countries in global economic decision-\r\nmaking. In order to ensure continued relevance and \r\nenhanced effectiveness, we, the developing countries, \r\nmust continue to call for all-inclusive reform of the \r\ninternational financial system and its governance \r\narchitecture. \r\n International trade is an important engine for \r\ndevelopment. The future of the multilateral trading \r\nsystem is at a crossroads. The suspension of the World \r\nTrade Organization negotiations on the Doha Round \r\nhas cast a shadow not only on the future of \r\ninternational cooperation on trade matters, but also on \r\nthe overall development expectations of developing \r\ncountries. In this regard, there is a need to make \r\nmeaningful progress in negotiations on agriculture, in \r\nparticular as they relate to the persistence of price-\r\ndistorting subsidies and other tariff and non-tariff \r\nmeasures. The absence of such progress directly \r\nimpacts, in particular, poverty eradication and \r\neconomic development. \r\n Another important issue facing the development \r\nagenda is helping developing countries that are facing \r\nlarge amounts of external debt. The extent of the debt \r\ncrises in these countries poses a great obstacle to \r\nadvancing the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) and taking forward human development. We \r\nbelieve that the debt cancellation must continue to \r\nreceive the needed support of the international \r\ncommunity. Therefore, my delegation would like to \r\njoin those who are calling for additional measures and \r\ninitiatives aimed at ensuring long-term debt \r\nsustainability through increased grant-based financing, \r\nthe cancellation of 100 per cent of the official \r\nmultilateral and bilateral debt of heavily indebted poor \r\ncountries and significant debt relief or restructuring for \r\nlow- and middle-income developing countries with an \r\nunsustainable debt burden. \r\n Angola, as a developing country, is committed to \r\naccelerating its economic growth and diversifying its \r\ndomestic financial sectors. We have adopted national \r\nmacroeconomic policies that promote sustained \r\neconomic growth and a supportive investment climate. \r\nOne of our financial priorities is to facilitate the \r\nfinancing of productive investments, particularly by \r\nstimulating the creation of small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises. We are also giving special attention to \r\naccess for all segments of the population to financial \r\nservices by promoting microcredit. This has led to \r\nsignificant progress over recent years, both in \r\neconomic terms and in our effort towards achieving the \r\nMDGs. \r\n Let me finish by stating that it is our conviction \r\nthat the presentations being given here have \r\nsubstantially contributed to assessing the progress \r\nmade, recognizing obstacles and constraints and \r\nidentifying new challenges and opportunities for \r\ndeveloping countries to overcome current difficulties \r\nin their development process. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Steve Dick Tennyson Matenje, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Matenje (Malawi): First and foremost, I \r\nthank the presidency for holding this third High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development. My \r\ndelegation endorses the statements made on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, the least developed \r\ncountries and the African Group by the delegations of \r\nPakistan, Bangladesh and Benin, respectively. \r\nHowever, allow me to make a few remarks from our \r\nnational perspective. \r\n The Government of Malawi attaches great \r\nimportance to the commitments made by world leaders \r\nin 2002, through the Monterrey Consensus on \r\nfinancing and development, for the achievement of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 4 \r\n \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\nMonterrey Conference reflected the resolve of the \r\ninternational community to assist the developing \r\ncountries to eradicate poverty, adhere to sustainable \r\neconomic growth and development and to participate \r\nfully in an inclusive and equitable global economic \r\nsystem. \r\n Our hopes for attaining the MDGs by 2015 were \r\nboosted in 2006 when Malawi qualified for debt relief \r\nunder the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt \r\n(HIPC) Initiative. The Malawi Government is \r\ndetermined to invest the resources freed under the \r\nHIPC Initiative in socio-economic programmes that \r\nmeet the criteria outlined in its national strategies. \r\n However, in the broader context of seeking to \r\nincrease the level of resources available for \r\ndevelopment and using those resources more \r\neffectively, we wish to speak of the issue of access to \r\nfinancing for development, which we consider should \r\nbe part of the agenda for renewed efforts for \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus. \r\n Our experience is that whatever the level of \r\nresources that are available or additional resources that \r\nmight be raised, some countries, such as Malawi, have \r\nconstrained access to those resources. This is due, in \r\nlarge part, to the allocation frameworks that are used \r\nand the weak capacities of the countries to meet the \r\nconditions for accessing the resources. As a result, the \r\ncountries access fewer external resources than are \r\nneeded to complement local resources to achieve the \r\nMDGs and to finance capital infrastructure to spur the \r\ngrowth that is required to reduce poverty on a \r\nsustainable basis. \r\n Decisions on resource allocation and continued \r\ndisbursement are based on debt sustainability \r\nframeworks, country performance and institutional \r\nassessments and localized performance assessment \r\nframeworks. These criteria have inbuilt problems that \r\nprevent least developed countries, such as Malawi, \r\nfrom accessing resources over and above the \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative and from accessing \r\nnew financing facilities. For example, the traffic light \r\nsystem of the debt sustainability frameworks means \r\nthat some least developed countries have constrained \r\naccess to resources because the criteria used favour the \r\ngiving of more grants than loans to those countries. \r\nWhile this is justified in terms of preventing the least \r\ndeveloped countries from reverting back to \r\nunsustainable debt situations, the system limits their \r\naccess to loans; yet, it is through loans that large \r\nallocations are permitted. \r\n Additionally, the timing and calculations of the \r\nscores of debt sustainability frameworks, country \r\nperformance and institutional assessments and \r\nperformance assessment frameworks that are used to \r\nmake decisions are historical, with long time lags. \r\nCountries like Malawi that have recently registered \r\nsignificant improvements in economic governance or \r\nperformance find that their scores do not reflect those \r\nimprovements. \r\n My delegation, therefore, recommends that the \r\nallocation frameworks and the calculation of indicators \r\nshould be revised so that, first, a premium could be \r\ngiven for recent strong progress in reforms. The criteria \r\nshould capture the percentage improvement in scores, \r\nusing formulas that quickly recognize and reward \r\nimprovements in performance. Secondly, variables \r\nrepresenting need — for instance, poverty levels — \r\nshould be those that are more MDG-oriented, rather \r\nthan just based on gross domestic product per capita. \r\nThat is because countries that are further away from \r\nachieving the MDGs have a greater need for resources. \r\nThirdly, low scores should be seen as both indicators of \r\nperformance and justification for more assistance. In \r\naddition, the calculation of performance-based \r\nallocations or performance assessment frameworks \r\nshould be done in a transparent manner, in consultation \r\nwith the Government and other stakeholders. \r\n Vertical funds, such as the global funds, the \r\nEducation for All Fast Track Initiative and the \r\nMillennium Challenge Account, are veritable forms of \r\nresource mobilization. In order to increase the access \r\nof least developed countries to those resources, special \r\nattention should be paid, first of all, to reviewing the \r\ncriteria for accessing the vertical funds. In addition, \r\ncountries should be assisted in building capacity to \r\nmeet those criteria. Secondly, analysis should be done \r\non a global level to ensure that the allocative efficiency \r\nof various vertical funds is MDG-responsive, meaning \r\nthat too many resources should not be tied to one area \r\nthat responds to a particular Millennium Development \r\nGoal at the expense of the achievement of the other \r\nGoals. We hope that these matters of access to \r\nresources will be given as much attention as the issues \r\nof the level and the effectiveness of resources. \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n5 07-56108 \r\n \r\n The General Assembly, in its resolution 61/229 \r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD), called upon the international community to \r\ndevote part of its resources to the development of \r\nAfrica. My delegation is therefore very optimistic that \r\nthe international community will continue to assist \r\nAfrica, through the NEPAD initiative, in its quest to \r\nmove out of extreme poverty. \r\n In conclusion, Malawi looks forward to a \r\nsuccessful High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, which is expected to provide a major \r\nsubstantive contribution to the preparation of the Doha \r\nConference. We also look forward to the Review \r\nConference on the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, to be held next year in Doha. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jalel Snoussi, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Tunisia. \r\n Mr. Snoussi (Tunisia) (spoke in French): This \r\nthird High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment marks an important stage in the process \r\nleading up to the Follow-up International Conference \r\nplanned for Doha in 2008 is an opportunity for all \r\nsectors of the international community to evaluate the \r\ncurrent situation and to explore other approaches and \r\nperspectives. \r\n Before I raise a few points that are of particular \r\nimportance to Tunisia, my delegation wishes to \r\nassociate itself fully with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and by the representative of Benin on behalf \r\nof the African Group.  \r\n There is no doubt that since the Monterrey \r\nConference we have seen fresh momentum in financing \r\nfor development, a subject that has become more \r\nvisible. This has made possible the establishment of a \r\nnumber of specific projects and mechanisms and the \r\nemergence of new financing opportunities. However, \r\nthat positive momentum has not led to action \r\nsufficiently consistent and tangible to permanently \r\nreverse the trends and to truly place financing for \r\ndevelopment in all its forms at the core of international \r\nactivities. \r\n In his report (A/62/217), the Secretary-General \r\ndraws the same mixed conclusions. While progress has \r\nbeen accomplished in some areas, much remains to be \r\ndone in others. The same appeals and the same \r\nconcerns continue to be repeated on debt, trade, official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), the international \r\nfinancial architecture, innovative sources of financing, \r\ninstitutional coherence and system-wide balance.  \r\n All these appeals share one common \r\ndenominator: the implementation of commitments \r\nundertaken in the development field. As has been \r\nindicated, the Monterrey Consensus was the outcome \r\nof common agreement on a global partnership for \r\ndevelopment in which all stakeholders have committed \r\nthemselves to fulfil a number of commitments in six \r\nmajor areas. Their interactive development and \r\ncomprehensive implementation should be a real engine \r\nfor economic, political, social and human development.  \r\n However, we note that the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nwhich is rightly considered the cornerstone of \r\ndevelopment, is today facing obstacles in its \r\nimplementation. That is a crucial point, and the \r\ninternational community, in particular the United \r\nNations, must give it higher priority and ensure an \r\nenabling environment for success. \r\n My delegation wishes to briefly draw attention to \r\nthe following points. First, the links of synergy and \r\ninteraction among trade, development and financing \r\nhave largely been established. The implementation, of \r\nthe Doha Development Agenda, in the framework of \r\nthe multilateral trade negotiations of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO), can gradually lead to balanced \r\ntrade relations and provide additional trade resources \r\nfor development. All countries have an interest in \r\nensuring the success of the Doha Agenda. Here, it \r\nshould be noted that this is the first time in the history \r\nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the \r\nWTO that development is at the centre of a negotiating \r\nround.   \r\n Secondly, given the negative impact of debt on \r\nthe capacity for financing and development, my \r\ndelegation believes that the international community \r\ncan identify debt alleviation and debt relief \r\nmechanisms without compromising the stability of \r\ninternational financial institutions or the financial \r\ncapacity of developed countries. The idea proposed \r\nsome time ago to hold within the United Nations a \r\nsubstantive debate on the issue of external debt, in \r\norder to agree upon a sustainable and predictable \r\nsolution, deserves consideration. \r\n Thirdly, official development assistance is seen as \r\na prerequisite and an engine for any strategy to \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 6 \r\n \r\nmobilize international financial resources. In \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular in the poorest \r\namong them, the macroeconomic reforms come up \r\nagainst needs to which ODA and other mechanisms \r\ncould respond. Despite the commitment of many \r\ncountries eventually to devote 0.7 per cent of their \r\ngross national income (GNI) to ODA, the volume of \r\nODA dropped in 2006. This risks further slowing down \r\nthe process of attaining the MDGs. \r\n Fourthly, climate change cuts across all areas \r\nlinked to development and is symptomatic of the \r\ndisparities we see in the global economic order. The \r\nmajor adaptation challenges and the ways to combat \r\nclimate change are an additional handicap for countries \r\nalready struggling with development problems and \r\nrequiring financing. This means a double adaptation for \r\ndeveloping countries that not all of them are able to \r\neffect. Climate change, thus, is another aspect that we \r\nneed to take into consideration in any approach to \r\nfinancing for development. \r\n Fifthly, through their high level of integration in \r\nthe global trading and financial markets, their \r\ndemographic density and their contribution to the \r\ndevelopment and strengthening of South-South \r\ncooperation, middle-income States play a major role in \r\nthe stabilization of the international economic and \r\npolitical environment. But they remain vulnerable and \r\nface development and poverty issues; they are \r\nparticularly exposed to trade and financial risks. That \r\ngroup of countries still has specific needs and should \r\nnot be penalized for their development efforts. \r\nDevelopment partners should maintain their support, as \r\nrecommended at the World Summit of September 2005. \r\n Finally, it is my delegation’s view that the \r\nfinancial flows from migrants remain a source of \r\nfinancing for development which is hardly or poorly \r\nexploited, because transfer costs are so high that they \r\ndrain the funds being transferred, encouraging the use \r\nof indirect routes, to the detriment of official channels. \r\nThus, much of that money remains outside of national \r\nfinancial systems. We must therefore agree on an \r\ninternational mechanism to reduce the costs of money \r\ntransfers so that we can provide additional resources \r\nfor financing for development. \r\n Like other speakers, my delegation supports the \r\nidea of establishing a United Nations mechanism to \r\nmonitor the implementation of commitments under the \r\nMonterrey Consensus in line with modalities to be \r\nagreed in a collective manner. The Monterrey \r\nConference was an important step. Let us hope that the \r\n2008 Doha Review Conference will be a true turning \r\npoint in consolidating our achievements launching a \r\nnew dynamic in the process of financing for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Juan Antonio Yáñez-Barnuevo, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Spain. \r\n Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Spanish delegation endorses the statement made \r\nby the representative of Portugal on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. \r\n As other speakers have stressed, we have reached \r\na special moment in the debate on financing for \r\ndevelopment, and this High-level Dialogue is an \r\nexcellent opportunity to take stock of the achievements \r\nmade since the 2002 Monterrey Conference, in the \r\nperspective of the 2008 Doha Conference, and building \r\non our commitment to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. It must be said \r\nthat we have undoubtedly made progress, but world \r\npopulation and poverty statistics show that there is still \r\nmuch to do. \r\n Spain believes that the international context of \r\neconomic growth in recent years must be exploited as \r\nan opportunity to advance resolutely in fulfilling the \r\nMDGs, and we have firmly committed ourselves in that \r\ndirection, significantly increasing our official \r\ndevelopment assistance. By increasing the amount and \r\nquality of our aid, working towards gender equality, \r\nsupporting the introduction of innovative instruments \r\nfor financing, and striving to improve the effectiveness \r\nof cooperation mechanisms, in line with the Paris \r\nDeclaration, Spain believes that we are making a \r\nsignificant contribution to that end. \r\n In only four years, Spain has more than doubled \r\nits official development assistance, raising it from 0.24 \r\nper cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004 \r\nto the foreseen goal, already inscribed in our State \r\nbudgets, of 0.5 per cent in 2008. We are committed to \r\nreaching the goal of 0.7 per cent in 2012, and the trend \r\nover the past few years bears witness to the fact that it \r\nis possible to do so. In 2007, Spain has allocated an \r\namount close to $6 billion to assistance. \r\n Furthermore, Spanish cooperation follows a \r\ngeographic and sectoral distribution focused on human \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n7 07-56108 \r\n \r\nneeds and least developed countries. In that regard, the \r\nbulk of our recent efforts has focused on sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica, without neglecting other regions that \r\ntraditionally receive preferential attention. On the other \r\nhand, we have not forgotten the multidimensional \r\nnature of poverty, including geographic areas — \r\nspecifically, Latin America and northern Africa — in \r\nwhich macroeconomic data hide very different social \r\nrealities. In that regard, we welcome the conclusions of \r\nthe second Conference on Middle-Income Countries \r\nrecently held in El Salvador, which continued the effort \r\nbegun in Madrid in March. \r\n Spain supports and clearly favours a multilateral \r\napproach to the policies of development cooperation. \r\nIn that sense, in the past three years we have \r\nstrengthened our contribution to the concessional funds \r\nof multilateral banks, and in particular the United \r\nNations system. In that case, and in the context of our \r\nmultilateral aid, our contribution to the United Nations \r\nrose from 4.5 per cent of such assistance in 2004 to \r\n16.6 per cent in 2006, and it is expected to reach 35 per \r\ncent in 2007. \r\n In implementing that commitment, we launched \r\nthe United Nations-Spain MDG Achievement Fund in \r\nlate 2006. So far, the Fund has entailed an outlay by \r\nSpain of €528 million — about $700 million — to fight \r\npoverty. The Fund works under the administration of \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme and \r\ncontributes in an innovative and comprehensive way to \r\nthe reform process of the United Nations, in particular \r\nto the implementation of the “One United Nations” \r\npilot programmes. \r\n Furthermore, Spain recognizes the prominence of \r\nthe international financial institutions in development \r\nissues. We are therefore committed to continuing to \r\nincrease our contributions to the concessional funds \r\nallocated to least developed countries, such as the \r\nWorld Bank’s International Development Association \r\nor the African Development Fund. \r\n The international community must not stop \r\nattending to the issue of the foreign debt of developing \r\ncountries, either through cancellation or by exploring \r\nthe possibilities of exchanging debt for development. \r\nIn Spain, the share of debt relief rose from slightly \r\nmore than 10 per cent of bilateral aid in 2003 to almost \r\n30 per cent in 2006, and we have also launched such \r\ninnovative initiatives as the Debt Relief for Education \r\nand Development programme. \r\n In addition, looking forward to the Doha \r\nConference in 2008, Spain firmly supports the focus on \r\nmechanisms that create innovative sources of \r\ndevelopment, which we have joined from the moment \r\nthey were launched. That is the case of such funds as \r\nthe International Finance Facility for Immunization, \r\nthe Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, \r\nand the Education for All Fast Track Initiative. We \r\nmust also highlight the efforts of the members of the \r\nInitiative against Hunger and Poverty, to which we \r\nbelong, with such results as the International Drug \r\nPurchase Facility, or the initiative on migrant \r\nremittances. Within that framework, Spain is also \r\ncontributing to the Funding Facility on Remittances in \r\nrural areas set up by the International Fund for \r\nAgricultural Development. \r\n In short, the valuable legacy of the Monterrey \r\nConference and the international community’s \r\ncommitment to achieving the MDGs offer us a \r\nfoundation for work to deepen and broaden our \r\nhorizons in the fight against poverty and in the \r\nimprovement of instruments for development. We must \r\nact with urgency and ambition. Spain reiterates here its \r\ncommitment to reaching those internationally agreed \r\ngoals and to working towards the success of the 2008 \r\nDoha Conference. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Aldo Mantovani, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Italy. \r\n Mr. Mantovani (Italy): First of all, allow me to \r\nsubscribe to the statement made by the representative \r\nof Portugal on behalf of the European Union. \r\n Seven years ago, we promised to halve poverty \r\nby 2015. We are now half-way to 2015, but we are not \r\nhalf-way to reaching our goals, as clearly shown by the \r\n2007 report on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). A lot remains to be done, mainly because the \r\nresources devoted to development assistance are far \r\nfrom sufficient. \r\n Italy has committed itself to doing more and to \r\ndoing better. In 2007, we expect the percentage of our \r\ngross national income devoted to official development \r\nassistance (ODA) to increase substantially. Funds for \r\ndevelopment cooperation have more than doubled; \r\nspecial funds have been allocated to development \r\nassistance to countries where Italy is supporting peace \r\nmissions. Some $350 million have been paid to the \r\nGlobal Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 8 \r\n \r\nMalaria. Earlier this month, an ad hoc law directed \r\nabout $1 billion to development assistance; \r\n$200 million are about to be channelled through United \r\nNations agencies, in addition to the usual contributions \r\ntraditionally devoted each year to international \r\norganizations. That is a clear signal of our willingness \r\nto improve not just the quantity but also the quality of \r\nour aid, and to strategically contribute to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n We all know that ODA is not the only answer to \r\nthe needs of developing countries. There are several \r\nadditional venues that can be explored and that — let \r\nme stress this point — must be considered additional to \r\ntraditional ODA. Italy is deeply engaged in identifying \r\ninnovative sources to finance development. We joined \r\nthe Leading Group on Solidarity Levies to Fund \r\nDevelopment earlier this year, and we look forward to \r\nthe contributions which that Group will provide on the \r\nway to Doha. \r\n Migrant remittances are increasingly attracting \r\nthe attention of the international development \r\ncommunity. There is no doubt that migrants’ \r\nremittances are private capital, and only their owners \r\nare entitled to decide on their use, but that growing, \r\ncountercyclical and predictable flow of capital in the \r\nregion of $300 billion a year could and should be made \r\neasier, safer, more transparent and more productive. \r\nFor instance, by simply reducing the costs of remitting \r\nmoney to the countries of origin of migrants, the \r\ncapital available for consumption and investment \r\nwould be increased by an equal amount. The greater \r\nuse of formal channels and banks would better match \r\nsavings and investments. Leveraging remittances \r\ntowards social and economic projects, in particular \r\nthrough the promotion of a better investment climate, \r\nwould be beneficial not only for local communities, but \r\nalso for the receiving countries as a whole. Better \r\nstatistics are a prerequisite; that is why we commend, \r\nfor instance, the efforts of the International Fund for \r\nAgricultural Development, which presented a \r\ncomprehensive survey on that subject a few days ago. \r\n On 9 February, an advance market commitment \r\n(AMC) initiative was launched in Rome. AMC is an \r\ninnovative mechanism through which pharmaceutical \r\ncompanies are encouraged to invest in research for new \r\nvaccines at affordable prices. A pilot project on \r\npneumococcus — a deadly disease that claims millions \r\nof children’s lives — will become operational in the \r\nnext few months. That innovative mechanism was \r\npromoted by Italy, endorsed by the G7 and supported \r\nby a group of countries that will commit themselves, \r\nthrough legally-binding agreements, to contributing \r\n$1.5 billion. Italy alone has committed to over \r\n$600 million. \r\n Another innovative initiative is the International \r\nFinance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm), which \r\nsome previous speakers have already mentioned today \r\nand which seeks to provide significant up-front \r\nfinancing for vaccine purchases by tapping capital \r\nmarkets through donor States’ guaranteed bonds. \r\nAgain, Italy will contribute $600 million over a \r\nnumber of years. I would like to stress that those \r\ninitiatives, and others such as the International Drug \r\nPurchase Facility, are mutually reinforcing. IFFIm aims \r\nat making the purchase of existing vaccines less costly \r\nfor developing countries, while AMCs aim at \r\nsupporting the research and development of new \r\nvaccines. Both are designed to help achieve MDGs 4, 5 \r\nand 6. \r\n Although no single MDG can be prioritized, we \r\nfeel it is important to mention that Italy has devoted \r\nmany funds and efforts to the health sector because we \r\nbelieve that there can be no way out of poverty if \r\nsanitary and hygienic conditions are not decent. There \r\ncan be no future if children have no chance to become \r\nadults. \r\n It is in that belief that, in Heiligendamm, together \r\nwith the other G-8 countries, we agreed to increase our \r\nfinancial commitment to the fight against the three \r\ngreat pandemics, and our yearly contribution to the \r\nGlobal Fund will amount to $180 million over the next \r\nthree years. Moreover, since 2003, Italy has invested \r\nabout $80 million in research for a vaccine against \r\nHIV/AIDS. \r\n All Italian initiatives, in every sector of \r\ndevelopment cooperation, have a common \r\ndenominator: ownership. Development must be fully \r\nowned by partner countries. Project modalities cannot \r\nbe imposed; they have to be negotiated and agreed \r\nupon by both donors and recipients. We are committed \r\nto implementing the Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, \r\nwhich was initiated in Rome and completed in Paris. \r\nWe believe that respecting its five principles is crucial \r\nto improving the impact of aid in recipient countries. \r\nResults cannot be measured only in terms of gross \r\ndomestic product growth. More factors have to be \r\nconsidered, including people’s perception of their lives, \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n9 07-56108 \r\n \r\ntheir surroundings, their prospects and their future. \r\nThat is why a global partnership for development is \r\nbecoming more and more necessary. \r\n That approach is particularly important when it \r\ncomes to aid for trade. Developing countries need \r\nabove all to increase their productive capacity. This is \r\nwhy we strongly support what we call aid for local \r\ntrade. Our main aim is to foster fair and sustainable \r\ntrade. In that perspective, we feel that the global aid for \r\ntrade agenda needs to be studied and revised, giving \r\nthe proper weight to ethical considerations. \r\n The basic purpose of all the MDGs is to improve \r\npeople’s lives. That is what we are all working for. \r\nThere are still seven years to go, and to make it happen \r\nwe need a global approach and global commitment, \r\nwith the active involvement of non-governmental \r\norganizations and private companies, and a road map to \r\naction combining all available energies and exploiting \r\nall possible synergies in the framework of the United \r\nNations system. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Claudia Blum, chairperson of the \r\ndelegation of Colombia. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nColombia aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, as well as with the statement made by Chile \r\non behalf of the Rio Group. \r\n My delegation congratulates the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on his contribution to convening \r\nthis High-level Dialogue. It is undoubtedly a valuable \r\nopportunity to renew the international community’s \r\ncommitment to the follow-up of the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development and the \r\nimplementation of its results, as well as to \r\nreinvigorating political support for the 2008 Doha \r\nConference, which has extraordinary significance in \r\nthat context. \r\n It has been more than five years since the \r\nadoption of the Monterrey Consensus, and significant \r\ntasks arising from the agreement remain to be \r\nundertaken. While many developing countries have \r\nsince deepened their positive internal processes in \r\norder to address the financial challenges of \r\ndevelopment, actions in that regard have not always \r\nbeen met with equivalent responses in the multilateral \r\ncontext, especially on the part of the developed \r\ncountries. \r\n International trade, identified in the Consensus as \r\nan engine for development, is an area that exemplifies \r\nthat situation. Efforts made by developing countries \r\ntowards the liberalization and internationalization of \r\ntheir economies — with tangible and encouraging \r\neffects in many cases — continue to encounter \r\nobstacles in international markets, including \r\nprotectionist measures, distortion and excesses in the \r\nuse of non-tariff barriers. The follow-up to the \r\nMonterrey Conference must be used to promote more \r\nfavourable attitudes and settings for free trade in \r\nequitable conditions at the bilateral, regional and \r\nmultilateral levels. \r\n I would like to point out five other areas that \r\nColombia considers to be crucial to promoting concrete \r\nand positive responses to the efforts of developing \r\ncountries to advance in the Monterrey agenda. \r\n First, the coherence and consistency of the \r\ninternational monetary, financial and trading systems \r\nmust be promoted with a view to supporting \r\ndevelopment. Secondly, greater transparency must be \r\nencouraged in the international financial markets so as \r\nto promote progress in the implementation of \r\ninnovative financing while avoiding the dangers of \r\nvolatility and the lack of clear regulatory frameworks. \r\nThirdly, the restructuring of the international financial \r\narchitecture — identified in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport as an unfinished task — is necessary if a more \r\nstable, secure and predictable system is to be built and \r\nthe greater involvement and participation of \r\ndeveloping countries ensured. Fourthly, we must \r\ndesign and implement mechanisms to track progress in \r\nthe genuine implementation of the global partnership \r\nfor development, contained in Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 8. Fifthly, financial and technical \r\ncooperation with middle-income countries must be \r\nincreased in order to meet the poverty eradication \r\nchallenges that those nations continue to face, as well \r\nas to avoid jeopardizing the significant achievements \r\nattained to date and to enhance their role as catalysts of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In recent years, Colombia has enacted various \r\nmeasures and policies with remarkable results in the \r\nsocial, macroeconomic and sustainable development \r\nfields that have put the country on track to achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Those actions \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 10 \r\n \r\ndemonstrate the resolve of the Colombian Government \r\nin areas that are relevant in the context of these \r\ndeliberations. Among those actions, I would highlight \r\nthe mobilization of domestic resources for \r\ndevelopment, in particular education, housing, social \r\nwelfare, environmental protection and the energy \r\nsector; the broad internationalization of trade; the \r\nconsolidation of a clear and integrated financial \r\nframework; the establishment of sound and \r\naccountable fiscal policies; and the promotion of an \r\neconomic environment conducive to employment \r\ngeneration, domestic and foreign investment, and \r\nprivate entrepreneurship with social responsibility, \r\nwhich has been promoted by our democratic security \r\npolicy. \r\n I conclude by ratifying Colombia’s firm \r\ncommitment to implementing policies for development \r\nand international agreements in this field, such as those \r\narising from the Monterrey Consensus. The members \r\nof the General Assembly may rest assured that my \r\ncountry will continue to work constructively in order to \r\ncontribute to the follow-up and implementation of \r\nthose agreements and to seize the opportunities for \r\nprogress offered by such important events as the \r\nupcoming Doha Conference. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ahmad Abdulrahman Al-Jarman, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the United Arab \r\nEmirates. \r\n Mr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I wish to extend to the President \r\nof the General Assembly our sincerest thanks and \r\nappreciation for convening this important meeting and \r\nfor his generous efforts to provide it with optimal \r\nguidance. \r\n I am pleased to extend my thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General for his valuable reports on the issue \r\nbefore us today. \r\n Since its inception, the United Arab Emirates has \r\npursued a foreign policy based on the principles of \r\nmutual respect and constructive cooperation in all \r\nfields, and on making an effective contribution to \r\ndevelopment and stability throughout the world. Prior \r\nto the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, the \r\nEmirates was a bellwether in providing development \r\nassistance to sisterly and friendly nations. We are also \r\neager to focus on the development of our own country \r\nin all fields, in accordance with our comprehensive \r\nnational development strategy. The 2002 Monterrey \r\nrecommendations were consequently in full accord \r\nwith my country’s development policies at the \r\ninternational and domestic levels. \r\n Domestically, my country has sought to mobilize \r\nlocal financial resources for development; create an \r\nenvironment conducive to promoting human, economic \r\nand social development through an economic policy for \r\ndevelopment based on the rational and reasonable \r\nexploitation of petroleum revenues; and to create the \r\ninfrastructure necessary to diversify our sources of \r\nnational income and development in the agricultural \r\nand industrial sectors, the liberalization of the \r\neconomy, and the promotion of private domestic and \r\nforeign investment. Such efforts have placed my \r\ncountry third in West Asia in its ability to attract \r\nforeign direct investment, according to the 2007 report \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment. \r\n On the basis of all this, the United Arab Emirates \r\nhas created an environment conducive to private \r\ndomestic and foreign investment, including development \r\ninvestment and other projects to enhance the national \r\neconomy; encourage the private sector and give it a \r\nbigger role in the development of our country; and \r\nstrengthen the financial and banking systems, utilizing \r\ninformation and communications technologies in all \r\nState and private facilities and making them accessible \r\nto all. \r\n Internationally, my country effectively contributes \r\nto the international development partnership. Most \r\nrecently, it allocated $10 billion to education in the \r\nMiddle East and to Dubai’s initiative to educate a \r\nmillion children in developing countries. My country \r\nhas also joined bilateral and multilateral conventions \r\nand agreements in the economic, cultural and industrial \r\nfields and has provided direct development assistance \r\nto many developing countries through national \r\ndevelopment institutions, first and foremost the Abu \r\nDhabi Fund for Development, in the form of \r\nconcessional loans, grants and aid amounting to more \r\nthan $70 billion. Ninety-five developing countries have \r\nbenefited from those funds. We have also invested \r\ndirectly in those countries. \r\n My country’s foreign assistance amounts to \r\n3.5 per cent of its gross domestic product, exceeding \r\nthe 0.7 percentage rate stipulated by the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. Moreover, we contribute substantially to \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n11 07-56108 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations agencies and all its regional and \r\ninternational institutions. We also make direct financial \r\nand in-kind contributions to promote reconstruction in \r\ncountries emerging from or still immersed in armed \r\nconflicts. \r\n My country recently joined the Donor Support \r\nGroup of the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs. We have also assimilated large \r\nnumbers of foreign workers — most of whom are from \r\ndeveloping countries — into our work force. That is \r\nconsidered a positive contribution to the international \r\nefforts to reduce poverty and unemployment in \r\ndeveloping countries in view of those workers’ \r\nremittances, which are among the sources of financial \r\nflows to fund development in developing countries. \r\n The United Arab Emirates reaffirms once again \r\nits commitment to implementing the recommendations \r\nset out in the Monterrey Consensus. We reiterate that it \r\nis essential that the international community, \r\nparticularly industrialized and developed countries, \r\ncontinue to fulfil all the commitments called for in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and to work to overcome all \r\npolitical and financial impediments hampering their \r\nfull and swift implementation. \r\n In conclusion, we look forward to the holding of \r\nthe Follow-up International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha, Qatar, in \r\n2008, so that we can gain a broader and clearer vision \r\nof ways to more effectively implement all the \r\nrecommendations set out in the Consensus. Thus, we \r\nwill fulfil the international community’s aspirations to \r\nimprove the humanitarian situation in all countries \r\nthroughout the world, and we reaffirm the importance \r\nof meeting in full the commitments made by principal \r\nstakeholders at the Conference. The United Arab \r\nEmirates will continue to cooperate with the \r\ninternational community in every way possible to \r\naccelerate and facilitate development programmes in \r\ndeveloping countries, in keeping with the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Iván Romero-Martínez, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Honduras. \r\n Mr. Romero-Martínez (Honduras) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We have listened very attentively to the \r\nimportant statements that have been made at this \r\nmeeting. All of them have largely agreed that, five \r\nyears after the Monterrey Consensus, there has been \r\nprogress and some success, but, at the same time, that \r\nthe overall aspirations and objectives of the Consensus \r\nremain unfulfilled. We are focusing our visions of the \r\nfuture on the Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development to Review the \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be \r\nheld in Doha during the second half of 2008. \r\n I believe that we can draw a number of important \r\nconclusions from the statements that have been made \r\nhere. As the representative of Chile said on behalf of \r\nthe Rio Group, the path to Doha should be open to \r\nparticipation by all stakeholders that have some \r\nrelation to financing for development, namely, States, \r\ninternational financial institutions, United Nations \r\nbodies and other international regional and subregional \r\nagencies. In particular, it should be open to active \r\nparticipation by civil society and the private sector, \r\nwithout forgetting equal gender participation. \r\n This morning, a delegation indicated to us that \r\nofficial development assistance last year represented \r\nonly 0.3 per cent of the gross national product of \r\ndeveloped countries. In real terms, that represents a \r\n5.1 per cent decline compared with 2005. Those \r\nstatistics oblige us to seek innovative forms of \r\ndevelopment, the harmonization of existing efforts and, \r\nin particular, a fundamental rethinking of development \r\nand the fight against poverty. This will require \r\nsufficient political will on the part of States to fulfil \r\ntheir agreed obligations. \r\n The mobilization of national financial resources \r\nfor development, as indicated in the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, will not be viable unless countries on the \r\nway to development are offered new and better \r\nalternatives for their exports and equitable and just \r\nprices for their exportable products, and unless unjust \r\nsubsidies and tariff barriers are eliminated. Similarly, \r\nwhile progress has been made in relieving external \r\ndebt, such debt remains an enormous burden on the \r\nmajority of our countries, hampering good governance \r\nand the proper functioning of national, public and \r\nprivate institutions.  \r\n The fight to eradicate poverty continues to be a \r\nconstant objective in the majority of our nations. But \r\npoverty also remains a tangible reality, even in the \r\nremotest corners of the globe.  \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 12 \r\n \r\n That is why we believe that we are in an \r\nimportant phase of reflection, which can enable us to \r\nconduct a frank and cool analysis of the current \r\nsituation in all our regions. An unjust world economic \r\norder and financial cooperation that does not take \r\nnational realities into account will lead only to a lack \r\nof concrete results and to frustration of the objectives \r\nthat we seek. \r\n Our country believes that cooperation can never \r\nbe a gift; rather, it is an instrument of development, \r\nenabling us to move forward with the objectives of \r\nimproving our societies and, in particular, improving \r\nliving conditions for human beings throughout the \r\nworld. Cooperation must be an instrument of human \r\ndevelopment, well managed well and with clear \r\nobjectives, that helps us to combat corruption, ensure \r\nrespect for human rights and achieve more just and \r\nequitable societies.  \r\n Our country is prepared to participate in all \r\ninternational forums that enable us to make progress \r\ntowards better societies and better living conditions for \r\npeoples. That is why we welcome this kind of meeting, \r\nas well as all the reports produced. If we create an \r\nenvironment of confidence, clear realities and mutual \r\ncooperation among all international actors, we will \r\nhave moved in the right direction. So let us move \r\nforward with will and political resolve to ensure that \r\nthe Doha Conference will mark the beginning of a new \r\noutlook and new results for a better world: a world of \r\npeace, a world without war, a world with social justice. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Henri Raubenheimer, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of South Africa. \r\n Mr. Raubenheimer (South Africa): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to associate itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Pakistan, on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by the \r\nrepresentative of Benin, on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. \r\n In Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002, heads of \r\nState and Government noted with concern the dramatic \r\nshortfalls in the  resources required to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthose set out in the United Nations Millennium \r\nDeclaration. Since then, the situation has deteriorated \r\neven further. The heads of State and Government \r\ntherefore resolved to address the challenges of \r\nfinancing for development around the world, in \r\nparticular to eradicate poverty, achieve sustained \r\neconomic growth and promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment in developing countries and, in so doing, \r\nto advance to a fully inclusive and equitable global \r\neconomic system. \r\n The heads of State and Government further stated \r\nthat their first step towards ensuring that the twenty-\r\nfirst century becomes the century of development for \r\nall will be geared to mobilize and increase the effective \r\nuse of financial resources and to achieve the national \r\nand international economic conditions needed to fulfil \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthose contained in the Millennium Declaration. This \r\ndemanded a new partnership between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries, which required a commitment to \r\nmobilizing domestic resources, attracting international \r\nflows, promoting international trade as an engine for \r\ndevelopment, increasing international financial and \r\ntechnical cooperation for development, sustainable \r\ndebt financing and external debt relief, and enhancing \r\nthe coherence and consistency of the international \r\nmonetary, financial and trading systems. \r\n Our leaders, through the outcomes of all major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, have laid the \r\nnecessary foundations to enhance development. The \r\nsubstance is in place, the commitments have been \r\nmade, the systemic issues have already been agreed \r\nupon. Five years after Monterrey, the full and timely \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, including \r\nall the outcomes of all the major conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields, is \r\nstill to be achieved. It is therefore important to accept \r\nthat what is actually lacking now is implementation. \r\n South Africa’s position on the need for follow-up \r\nto the International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment is a matter of public record. Our message \r\nhas been consistent: follow-up requires decisive action \r\non each and every one of the commitments that have \r\nbeen made at the major United Nations summits and \r\nconferences in the economic, social and related fields. \r\n In this regard, South Africa cannot overemphasize \r\nthe need for the United Nations to play a fundamental \r\nrole in the promotion of international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment and for the coherence, coordination and \r\nimplementation of the actions agreed upon by the \r\ninternational community. We believe that strengthening \r\ncoordination within the United Nations system, \r\nincluding with the Bretton Woods institutions and the \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n13 07-56108 \r\n \r\nWorld Trade Organization, is a priority, in order to \r\nsupport sustained economic growth, eradication of \r\npoverty and hunger, and sustainable development in \r\ndeveloping countries. This is essential if the United \r\nNations is to fulfil its mandate of achieving an \r\nequitable, integrated, coordinated and comprehensive \r\napproach to the global partnership for development to \r\ncreate a better life for all those millions of people who \r\nso desperately need to be lifted out of dehumanizing \r\nand degrading poverty and hunger. \r\n The Review Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment scheduled to be held in Doha next year is \r\nan ideal opportunity for the United Nations to monitor \r\nand track progress and review implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and to establish an effective \r\nmechanism to monitor, review and follow up that \r\nimplementation. It will provide us with a timely \r\nopportunity for stocktaking both in terms of \r\nachievements and the requirements for full \r\nimplementation.  \r\n At this time we wish to once again reiterate the \r\ncall to developed countries for the full and timely \r\nimplementation of the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment so as to enable developing countries to \r\nachieve the goals and targets of the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, by 2015. Anything less would \r\nundermine the good faith with which we have all along \r\nbeen assured that commitments made would be \r\nimplemented. We would not want those commitments \r\nto be denigrated to mere lofty ideals of development. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchairperson of the delegation of Brazil, Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): This High-level Dialogue is \r\nrather timely. It provides an opportunity to start \r\npreparing a successful conference on financing for \r\ndevelopment next year. We expect this meeting to lead \r\nto the convergent views we need in order to build a \r\ntrue international partnership in favour of the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n As Brazil associates itself with the interventions \r\nmade by Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, and by Chile on behalf of the Rio Group, I \r\nwould like to convey our national perspective on the \r\nchallenges that lay ahead. \r\n Brazil fully concurs with the notion that countries \r\nare responsible for their own development and that \r\ninternational cooperation should support national \r\nefforts, as expressed in the Monterrey Consensus. \r\n In Brazil, economic policy has been successful in \r\nreconciling macroeconomic stability and growth with \r\nincome distribution. One key achievement of such \r\npolicy was a significant reduction of poverty. Brazil \r\nhas attained the first Millennium Development Goal \r\nten years ahead of the agreed schedule. Since the \r\nMDGs were launched, forty million Brazilians have \r\nbeen lifted above the poverty line. In addition, the \r\ncurrent Growth Acceleration Plan will not only boost \r\nshort-term economic growth but also strengthen the \r\nfoundations for long-term, sustained growth. Brazil has \r\nsharply decreased its external debt and, having \r\naccumulated international reserves of more than $162 \r\nbillion, has become a net creditor. As a result, the \r\nexternal vulnerability that interrupted previous growth \r\ncycles has been greatly reduced. \r\n Brazil is hardly alone in its efforts. Throughout \r\nthe developing world, sound economic policies, \r\ncoupled with an enhanced investment climate, have \r\nhelped to mobilize domestic resources for \r\ndevelopment. It is clear, therefore, that developing \r\ncountries are fulfilling their commitments under the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. \r\n However, a global economic environment \r\nconducive to growth remains critical. Macroeconomic \r\nstability in the developed world is essential to maintain \r\nthe current positive momentum. Financial turbulence \r\ngenerated in the industrialized world should not be \r\nallowed to hinder the mobilization of resources for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n International trade is equally important in \r\nsupporting the efforts undertaken by developing \r\ncountries. In paragraph 26 of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, developed countries committed to placing \r\nthe needs and interests of developing countries at the \r\nheart of the Doha Round. Unfortunately, this \r\ncommitment remains unfulfilled. The issues \r\nparticularly relevant to developing countries, as agreed \r\nin paragraph 28 of the Consensus, have not been \r\nproperly addressed. My delegation urges developed \r\ncountries to honour such commitments.  \r\n Brazil has spared no efforts to help negotiations \r\nmove forward. President Lula himself has been \r\npersonally involved. However, immobility on the part \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 14 \r\n \r\nof some developed partners has made it difficult to \r\nreach consensus. The successful conclusion of the \r\nDoha Round, with meaningful progress in agricultural \r\ngoods, would greatly contribute to poverty reduction in \r\nthe developing world. \r\n The urgent need for greater access to the markets \r\nof developed countries does not efface the fact that \r\nSouth-South trade has become increasingly important \r\nfor developing countries. Such a trend has been \r\ncertainly stimulated by the Global System of Trade \r\nPreferences. The completion of the current negotiations \r\nstands as a powerful instrument to strengthen the \r\ncommercial ties in the developing world. Another \r\navenue of cooperation is aid for trade. Developing \r\ncountries will benefit from enhanced market access \r\neventually brought about by the Doha Round only if \r\nthey can overcome domestic obstacles to export \r\ngrowth. With this in mind, Brazil has offered technical \r\nassistance to aid for trade within the framework of \r\nSouth-South cooperation. \r\n The Doha International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development should not only review the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, but also \r\ndiscuss the successful launching of innovative finance \r\nmechanisms. Since he first took office, President Lula \r\nhas promoted international mobilization aimed at \r\nfighting hunger and poverty. The Action against \r\nHunger and Poverty, launched by Brazil, Chile, France \r\nand Spain during the fifty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly, has produced concrete results.  \r\n The International Drug Purchase Facility \r\n(UNITAID) was launched last September. It is a \r\nmechanism, hosted by the World Health Organization \r\nand funded mainly through a solidarity levy on air \r\ntickets, which aims to facilitate access to drugs for \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The Facility \r\noperates through pooled procurement and direct \r\nnegotiations with producers. Just one year after its \r\ninception, UNITAID has already disbursed over $250 \r\nmillion in 80 beneficiary countries. Converging \r\ninitiatives, such as the International Finance Facility \r\nfor Immunization and the advance market commitment \r\nfor vaccines, have been proposed and are being \r\nimplemented.  \r\n As we have said before, innovative financial \r\nmechanisms are designed not to replace but rather to \r\ncomplement the promised increase in official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). Such mechanisms \r\nmust raise additional funds above and beyond the \r\ncommitments already made by developed countries.  \r\n For Brazil, financing for development is a vital \r\ninstrument, but it is still an instrument. Our true goal, \r\nwhich is rooted in the Brazilian constitution, is to \r\nconfer a humane and ethical dimension to economic \r\ngrowth. At the centre of our endeavours must be the \r\nmen, women and children whose plight we are called \r\nupon to alleviate and, in time, turn into a decent life. \r\nThe world has the financial and intellectual resources \r\nto do this; it is really a matter of choice. If we, the \r\ninternational community as a whole, are wise enough \r\nto choose solidarity, we all, rich and poor alike, will \r\nreap the immense benefits of that choice. It is up to us. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. María Rubiales de Chamorro, \r\nchairperson of the delegation of Nicaragua. \r\n Mrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): I would like at the outset to welcome this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. It \r\nhas special significance because it is part of the \r\npreparatory process for the Monterrey Consensus \r\nfollow-up, which will be held in Doha in late 2008. We \r\nhope that the Conference will be the beginning of \r\njustice in the multilateral arena, helping developing \r\ncountries to enjoy prosperity, to eradicate poverty and, \r\nat the least, to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs).  \r\n As a member of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nNicaragua endorses completely the working platform \r\npresented by Her Excellency Ms. Hina Rabbani Khar, \r\nState Minister for Economic Affairs of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan on behalf of our Group. We agree \r\ntoo with the statement made by His Excellency \r\nEduardo Gálvez, Director of Multilateral Policy in the \r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs of Chile, on behalf of the \r\nRio Group.  \r\n We feel that greater attention should be focused \r\non the follow-up and implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. The Consensus emphasized what actions \r\nwere needed to achieve the agreed development goals. \r\nFor this reason, we believe that in Doha in 2008 we \r\nmust move forward towards the creation of machinery \r\nto achieve these goals, and if possible make in-depth \r\nprogress on the six major thematic areas of the \r\nConsensus.  \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n15 07-56108 \r\n \r\n It is time for the developed countries to show real \r\nand effective solidarity with the developing countries. \r\nIt is time to promote investment in development going \r\nbeyond the concept of development assistance. We \r\nconsider that this new dimension and these new \r\nconcepts, paired with governmental responsibility and \r\na commitment to creating conditions to reduce poverty, \r\nincrease investor confidence and promote the \r\nformulation and ownership of development plans of \r\nState leadership, constitute the key to achieving, at the \r\nvery least, the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n In this forum, we would like to pay tribute to the \r\nefforts we have made since the Bolivarian Alternative \r\nfor the Americas (ALBA), in which Nicaragua is a \r\nparticipant, was instituted. ALBA is an initiative that, \r\nfrom a South-South perspective, sets aside the old \r\nconcepts of trade relations and adopts a new, far more \r\nimportant one: human solidarity and investment for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n The Government of my country has set certain \r\nconcrete goals for itself that will allow us, in the \r\nmedium term, to reduce poverty levels and increase \r\npublic and private investments. We are endeavouring to \r\nimprove energy infrastructures and protect the \r\nenvironment, with programmes such as Zero Hunger, \r\nZero Usury. Policies backed by bold social \r\nprogrammes and the creation of human capital are \r\nbringing us closer to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs).  \r\n My Government has entered into a very important \r\nagreement with the International Monetary Fund \r\n(IMF). As stated by the President of the Republic, \r\nCommander Daniel Ortega,  \r\n “The Government has been discussing and \r\nnegotiating with the International Monetary Fund \r\nagreements that take an approach clearly laid \r\ndown since the beginning. We will work with the \r\nFund with the objective that these agreements \r\nwill create conditions giving priority to the fight \r\nagainst poverty and hunger, the struggle to revive \r\nthe country’s economy and the struggle to create \r\njobs.” \r\n Thus, the focus is on tackling poverty, creating \r\nconditions favourable for generating wealth and \r\ncreating jobs, and creating a climate in which we can \r\nincrease our national productive capacities and foreign \r\ninvestment. In this way we plan to develop to the \r\nmaximum extent our capacity to generate wealth and \r\ncombat poverty. For years, that capacity has reflected a \r\nsystem that has marginalized us as actors and \r\nstakeholders for development.  \r\n Looking ahead towards Doha, my tiny country \r\nwants the Conference to complement new consensus \r\nand new commitments to promote development. That \r\nwill enable us to increase the percentage of national \r\nincome devoted to development cooperation, or at least \r\nmake a major effort to ensure that flows of official \r\ndevelopment assistance reach our goal of 0.7 per cent. \r\nIn this context, the new Development Cooperation \r\nForum of the Economic and Social Council must be the \r\nmain vehicle to enhance the effectiveness and \r\ntransparency of cooperation.  \r\n Foreign direct investment must play a dominant \r\nrole in promoting growth and the attainment of the \r\ndevelopment goals, especially concerning \r\ninfrastructure and wherever there is need for a greater \r\nability to attract investment in projects fundamental to \r\nsustainable development. In Doha, we should try to \r\nestablish a plan of action that will make it possible to \r\ncreate or strengthen the capacity of poor or vulnerable \r\neconomies to attract multilateral and private \r\ninvestment.  \r\n External debt relief, through the Highly-Indebted \r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral \r\nDebt Relief Initiative, will help bring resources into \r\nour countries for development — here, Nicaragua is no \r\nexception.  \r\n Reform of the international financial system is \r\nneeded. This should include the right for us to vote and \r\ntake decisions in the international financial institutions. \r\nSuch reforms, including reform of the International \r\nMonetary Fund, will aim at ensuring financial stability, \r\nand access to liquid resources by countries needing \r\nthem. At the same time, it enables us to mitigate the \r\nimpact of volatility through short-term capital flows. \r\n Progress will be made on establishing better \r\nconditions for trade for developing countries. \r\n Finally, may solidarity and development \r\ninvestment be our guide as we seek to achieve well-\r\nbeing and an equitable distribution of wealth. History \r\nand all our peoples require this. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Andrei Dapkiunas, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Belarus. \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 16 \r\n \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nMonterrey Consensus is a unique instrument and an \r\nimportant breakthrough factor in our pursuit of \r\nfinancing for development. The key to the \r\neffectiveness of that instrument is the comprehensive \r\nuse of all ways and means of ensuring positive \r\ndynamics in the flow of development resources. Where \r\ndo we see unutilized resources? \r\n First, we need to improve the targeted nature of \r\nassistance. The benefits of new development \r\napproaches have only been felt by a small group of \r\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in \r\ntransition. The gap in the levels of development and, \r\nconsequently, in well-being between rich and poor \r\ncountries is increasing. It is not only along the North-\r\nSouth divide, but also among the countries of the \r\nSouth. \r\n The United Nations should pay particular \r\nattention to providing financial and technical assistance \r\nto the most vulnerable and poorest countries. Last year, \r\nwhen we drafted the resolution on integrating countries \r\nwith economies in transition into the world economy, \r\nBelarus spoke of the need to improve the targeted \r\nnature of assistance. Such an approach is also \r\nnecessary in planning international development \r\ncooperation on a global scale. Countries with the \r\ngreatest need for international assistance should \r\nreceive such assistance on a greater scale. \r\n Fair conditions for international trade — given \r\ntheir importance and consequences — exceed by far \r\nthe importance of official development assistance, as \r\nthey not only allow developing economies to grow \r\nfaster but also decrease their dependence on \r\ninternational assistance.  \r\n However, the Doha Round of negotiations has not \r\nbeen completed, and there is no significant progress in \r\nsight. The obstinacy of industrial countries is \r\nunderstandable from the traditional viewpoint of \r\nputting the prosperity and security of one’s own \r\nnational markets and domestic producers first. Yet this \r\nobstinacy amounts to short-sightedness in a globalized \r\nworld economy and with regard to the disastrous \r\nconsequences of protectionism, new flows of migrants, \r\nan increase of distrust among States and an upsurge in \r\nextremism and terrorism. \r\n Such an approach often stands in the way of \r\naccession of new members to the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO). We must still deal with the \r\nunacceptable practice of using the accession process to \r\nthe World Trade Organization as an instrument, not \r\nonly of economic pressure but also of political pressure \r\naimed at gaining a coercive and unilateral advantage. \r\n With the active involvement of the United \r\nNations and the participation of all interested States, \r\nwe should strive to establish fair conditions for \r\naccession to the WTO that would take into account the \r\ntrade and financial needs of the acceding States and \r\ntheir real development needs. \r\n We also call for an end to the practice of using \r\nunilateral coercive measures as an instrument of \r\neconomic pressure. We must not allow individual \r\nStates — even if they are the most powerful and \r\ninfluential — to assume the rights and powers of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n We are seeing growing obstacles to improving the \r\ninternational financial system and architecture. We feel \r\nthat the time has come for a profound transformation of \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions. They were established \r\nin a different era and for different purposes. They \r\nshould be modified and made to serve the cause of \r\nglobal development. In that regard, Belarus welcomes \r\nas an initial step in the right direction the measures \r\nundertaken by the International Monetary Fund and the \r\nWorld Bank in 2006-2007 to reform the quota and \r\nvoting systems. \r\n Bridging the technological gap between \r\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in \r\ntransition and others is an urgent issue, and one that \r\nimpedes the global development process. The transfer \r\nof modern technologies to those countries on \r\npreferential terms in a century of innovative \r\ndevelopment may frequently have a larger impact than \r\nthe mere provision of financial resources. That is \r\nespecially true with regard to reducing the dependence \r\nof commodity-producing countries on the global \r\nsupply of energy resources. \r\n The United Nations can and should develop \r\npractical arrangements for the transfer and distribution \r\nof technologies for alternative and renewable energy \r\nsources on a global scale. We propose holding an \r\ninformal thematic debate in the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session on recognizing technologies for \r\nalternative and renewable energy resources as the \r\ncommon property of humankind. \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n17 07-56108 \r\n \r\n South-South cooperation has a positive impact on \r\nthe development process. We call on the United \r\nNations to increase its support for South-South \r\ncooperation by utilizing the potential of its specialized \r\nagencies, funds and programmes. \r\n In the process of reforming and renewing the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, Belarus has supported \r\nthe establishment of the Development Cooperation \r\nForum. We hope that the Forum will help to effectively \r\nmonitor the implementation of previous agreements \r\nand promote the search for new opportunities for \r\ncooperation on financing for development. That is \r\nespecially important in terms of preparing for the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to be held in Doha. As a member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, Belarus will do its best \r\nto use the Council’s potential to ensure an effective \r\npreparation for that important international forum. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdullah Alsaidi, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Yemen. \r\n Mr. Alsaidi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, my delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Pakistan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The Republic of Yemen is a least developed \r\ncountry that makes significant efforts towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Those Goals have gained top priority in our \r\nnational policy and five-year development plan for the \r\nperiod from 2006 to 2011. The Goals seek to alleviate \r\npoverty through the consolidation of small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprise programmes, technical \r\neducation programmes, the empowerment of women, \r\nensuring investment opportunities and services and \r\npromoting good governance, among other things.  \r\n In the implementation of our plans and \r\nprogrammes, we unfortunately come up against \r\nsignificant obstacles, given scarce potentials, lack of \r\naid opportunities and technical and material assistance \r\nand the increased need to develop basic services. Here, \r\nI would like to explain some statistics. The average per \r\ncapita income in Yemen in 2005 was $600 a year. The \r\npercentage of those living below the poverty line was \r\n36 per cent of the total population. Approximately  \r\n10 million individuals therefore do not have access to \r\nmedical services or electricity. Unemployment among \r\nyoung people is at 37 per cent. More than 2 million \r\nchildren do not have access to education. Yemen is one \r\nof those countries that lacks water resources and \r\ntherefore faces major obstacles in that area.  \r\n Despite all of those difficulties, my Government \r\nhas been cooperating with donor countries and \r\ninternational organizations with a view to \r\nimplementing national strategies to advance the \r\ndevelopment process so that we can achieve the \r\nMDGs. In that context, my delegation would like to \r\nunderscore the importance of foreign assistance in \r\nsupporting national budgets in the least developed \r\ncountries. National strategies should be considered as a \r\nframework for cooperation and a partnership \r\nframework for development. However, the volume of \r\nofficial aid is not at the required level. The report of \r\nthe Secretary-General (A/62/217) indicated that ODA \r\nhas progressively decreased since the 2002 \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and was just at 0.3 per cent of gross \r\nnational product (GNP) in 2006. In addition, for the \r\nperiod 2006-2007, the expected level of official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) is far from sufficient to \r\nallow the achievement of the desired objectives. For \r\nthis, we need some $150 billion to make sure we can \r\nachieve the MDGs by 2015.  \r\n My delegation underscores the need for the \r\ninternational partners to honour their commitments, \r\nwhich is to allocate 0.7 per cent of their GNP as ODA. \r\nMy delegation asserts the need for an equitable \r\ndistribution of ODA, to be shared equally among all \r\nrecipient countries. Yemen’s share of ODA is presently \r\nmuch lower than it is in other developing countries, at \r\n$13 per capita annually, while least developed \r\ncountries’ share is $33 per capita annually. This means \r\nthat we need to revise the scale of ODA allocated to \r\nYemen.  \r\n The problem of external debt is a major obstacle \r\nfor my Government in its implementation of its \r\ndevelopment programmes, plans and national strategy. \r\nTherefore, it is crucial for us to examine the expansion \r\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative and \r\nthe multilateral debt relief initiative. We must be \r\nflexible in the way we act, for debt relief cannot \r\nsubstitute for other sources of financing. Development \r\npartners are called upon to cancel the debt of the least \r\ndeveloped countries so they can achieve their \r\ndevelopment goals, the goals agreed upon by the \r\ninternational community, including the MDGs. \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 18 \r\n \r\n My delegation expresses its concerns about the \r\nstagnation of the Doha Round of trade negotiations. \r\nThis round started in November 2001 and its stagnation \r\nhas a negative impact on the economic opportunities of \r\ndeveloping and least developed countries and will have \r\na more damaging impact on poor people. In his report, \r\nthe Secretary-General refers to the possibility of the \r\ncostly financial impact this could have post-2007. \r\nBalanced and development-oriented solutions have not \r\nyet been found in the World Trade Organization for the \r\nkey aspects of the negotiations. My delegation would, \r\ntherefore, urge developed countries to demonstrate \r\nflexibility and political will to achieve some positive \r\nprogress in the Doha Round trade negotiations. It calls \r\nfor the outcome document of the Doha Round to give \r\nreal opportunities to developing countries, in \r\nparticular, the least developed countries, to allow their \r\nproducts to have access to the markets of developed \r\ncountries without customs duties so that their trade \r\ncapabilities could be strengthened and protectionism \r\nfor their national products could come to an end. \r\n To conclude, there is no doubt that there is an \r\nurgent need for a mechanism that would monitor and \r\neffectively follow up the implementation of the \r\nagreements achieved in financing for development and \r\nmy delegation looks forward to the Conference to \r\nReview the Implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, to be held next year in Doha, Qatar. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. El Mostafa Sahel, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Morocco. \r\n Mr. Sahel (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is please to participate in this important \r\nmeeting and hopes that our discussion concludes with \r\nconcrete recommendations on the question of financing \r\nfor development. My delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Benin on \r\nbehalf of the African Group and the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China.  \r\n Our meeting is being held at a particularly \r\nimportant transition time as we discuss both the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and next year’s Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, to be held in Doha, as well as the \r\nMillennium Declaration, which is reaching its midway \r\npoint to the 2015 deadline for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n The Monterrey Consensus has given financing for \r\ndevelopment a greater profile, highlighting the \r\ndifferent components which are all necessary, \r\ncomplementary and in synergy: internal and external \r\nresources, public and private resources, governmental \r\ninstruments and a better allocation of resources. \r\nSeveral efforts have been made to implement the \r\ninternational commitments undertaken by the donor \r\ncommunity and by the developing countries to shoulder \r\nthe challenge of financing development. However, \r\ndeveloping countries cannot achieve the MDGs without \r\nhaving access to sufficient and predictable means of \r\nfinancing. Midway to the achievement of these goals, \r\ndevelopment indicators in many developing countries \r\nare below objectives established, a fact which bodes ill \r\nfor them being on track for 2015. The States in \r\nquestion are, in particular, African States, whose \r\npoverty rates have not decreased in recent years. To \r\nenable the African countries to achieve their \r\ndevelopment objectives and to mitigate the effects \r\nacross the continent, we need the mobilization of all \r\ndevelopment partners and all resources, both external \r\nand internal.  \r\n Developing countries have made considerable \r\nefforts at reform and have mobilized their internal \r\nfinancial capacities in order to overcome their \r\nshortcomings in the  development sphere. However, the \r\ninsufficiency of their own resources, the fact that \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) has decreased, \r\nand the burden of their debt continue to limit their \r\nambitions. It is urgent to reverse the current regressive \r\ntrend of ODA, which we see despite commitments and \r\npromises made. \r\n In addition to a decrease in aid, there is the debt \r\nburden which continues to cripple the budgets of \r\ndeveloping countries and nullify their development \r\nefforts. The commitments recently taken in the \r\nframework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\ninitiative are praiseworthy and deserve our support; \r\nhowever, these initiatives are not sufficient and much \r\nremains to be done to cancel the debt of the most \r\nheavily indebted poor countries. Other measures are \r\nnecessary to supplement the efforts being deployed by \r\ndeveloping countries with medium and low income in \r\nthe sustainable management of their external debt. \r\n If international trade is considered the driving \r\nforce of economic growth, capable of generating \r\nresources to finance development, then the \r\nexpectations of developing countries in the Doha \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n19 07-56108 \r\n \r\nRound may not be met due to a lack of progress made \r\nin multilateral negotiations. In addition, their products \r\nstill confront tariff and non-tariff barriers in accessing \r\ndeveloped countries’ markets. That means that a \r\ndevelopment dimension of the Doha Round is one of \r\nthe rare glimmers of hope that developing countries \r\ncan count on to benefit fully from the opportunities of \r\nthe international and multilateral trade system and to \r\nachieve sustained economic growth.  \r\n Foreign direct investment is an important source \r\nof financing for development as it has an impact on \r\nemployment and technology transfer. We should, \r\nhowever, note that developing countries, and in \r\nparticular, the poorest among them, receive the lowest \r\namounts of foreign direct investment. Therefore, it is \r\nimportant that we support the efforts made by \r\ndeveloping countries to attract foreign direct \r\ninvestment by encouraging their activities to improve \r\nthe business environment and their system of \r\ngovernance.  \r\n Alongside these traditional sources of financing, \r\nwhich remain indispensable for development, we \r\nconsider that the next review conference at Doha will \r\nbe a better occasion for us to turn our attention to other \r\nsources of innovative financing, which would \r\novercome the shortfall and shortcomings that we have \r\nidentified since Monterrey.  \r\n The International Drug Purchase Facility \r\n(UNITAID) is an edifying example of a new innovative \r\napproach that we would like to encourage and whose \r\npotential we would like to explore. \r\n If we take stock of the situation, we see that we \r\nneed unwavering political will to make the \r\ninternational environment as conducive as possible to \r\nfinancing for development. The Review Conference \r\nscheduled next year in Doha is a vital meeting that \r\nshould breathe new life into international cooperation \r\nand should strengthen the international partnership \r\nbetween the countries of the South and the countries of \r\nthe North, a partnership forged in Monterrey. Morocco \r\nis prepared to make its contribution to ensure the \r\nsuccess of the Conference. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Daniele Bodini, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of San Marino. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this High-level Dialogue on financing for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Since Monterrey, much progress has been \r\nachieved toward the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). However, I detect, among many participants, \r\nmixed feelings about the midterm results. Some are \r\ncasting doubts about the willingness of certain donors \r\nto fulfil their commitments, others are pointing out that \r\nrecipient countries could improve their levels of \r\ntransparency and good governance. \r\n Our happiness is derived from the fulfilment of \r\nour expectations. It may be that we have to adjust our \r\nimmediate expectations, taking into account all the \r\ninnumerable and overwhelming factors that influence \r\nour daily life, such as climate change, natural \r\ncatastrophes, migration, epidemics, demographic \r\nexplosions, commodity price fluctuations and financial \r\nturbulence, not to mention such man-made disasters as \r\nconflicts or acts of terrorism. \r\n Despite all these challenges, San Marino believes \r\nthat a great effort has been made so far by all the \r\nparties involved and that additional good faith and \r\nsustained and decisive effort should be extended to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. We, the \r\npeople and the Government of San Marino, are \r\ncommitted to doing our part. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to add that we are \r\nvery pleased that the United Nations is enhancing its \r\ncentral role in monitoring, coordinating and planning \r\nthe world development process. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Khalid Abdullah Krayyem Shawabkah, chairman \r\nof the delegation of Jordan. \r\n Mr. Shawabkah (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made by the \r\ndelegation of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China.  \r\n Given the vertical and horizontal intensification \r\nof the causes of poverty in the world and the \r\nmultidimensional nature of this problem, coordinated \r\ninternational and regional policies are the sole means \r\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) in the fight against poverty.  \r\n For those reasons, the Heads of State in \r\nMonterrey agreed to find solutions to the problem of \r\npoverty from which many countries suffer. They \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 20 \r\n \r\ndecided to act together to face the challenge of \r\nfinancing for development throughout the world, \r\nparticularly in developing countries, and to combat \r\npoverty, achieve sustainable economic progress and \r\nencourage sustainable development, taking into \r\naccount the open international economic order.  \r\n Despite the efforts of developing countries to \r\nmake use of local resources and to attract foreign \r\ninvestment, the amount of resources available remains \r\nfar below what would be required for sustainable \r\neconomic development and for the eradication of \r\npoverty. Local resources must be coupled with \r\ncomplementary measures that would allow for the \r\nimplementation of national development strategies, \r\nnamely foreign financing and investment and official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). There is also a need to \r\nincrease the participation of developing countries in \r\ninternational economic decision-making. \r\n Jordan is a leader among countries that support \r\ndevelopment policies for combatting poverty and \r\nhunger, and it is endeavouring to achieve economic \r\ndevelopment for all peoples of the world. Jordan works \r\nin the spirit of its King Abdullah II, reflected in his \r\naddress to the Monterrey Conference, when he said \r\nthat cooperation among all countries to identify \r\nshortcomings and to eradicate poverty constitutes a \r\nmoral duty and that modern global technology and \r\nknow-how, openness and economic exchanges have \r\nopened up new possibilities for us to work together, \r\npossibilities that did not exist before.  \r\n Jordan is one of 28 countries that supported the \r\nsolidarity tax on air travel in order for income thereby \r\ngenerated to be used to fight against various diseases \r\nthroughout the world and to buy necessary medicines.  \r\n At the national level, the Jordanian Government \r\nhas drafted and promulgated legislation to attract direct \r\nforeign investment and to create an environment \r\nfavourable for investment. We have also established \r\ntariff-free trade zones, such as the special economic \r\nzone at Al-Aqaba, as well as industrial zones. We have \r\nalso signed free trade agreements with the United \r\nStates and the European Union.  \r\n To combat poverty and unemployment, Jordan, \r\nunder the auspices of Queen Rania, created a society \r\nfor financing small enterprises aimed at combatting \r\npoverty and unemployment by granting microcredit to \r\nbeneficiaries who then become small business owners \r\ncapable of facing the challenges of life.  \r\n The circle of financing has expanded with time to \r\ninclude more services such as the banking savings \r\nsector, the insurance sector and the credit sector so that \r\nthe concerns of the poorest and most vulnerable groups \r\nare also addressed. In the past few years, the \r\nGovernment spent $1 billion on job creation and anti-\r\npoverty programmes. The Society of Small and \r\nMedium-Sized Enterprises has financed 33,000 \r\nmanufacturing projects amounting to 88 million dinars, \r\nwhich have benefited 200,000 individuals. We have \r\nalso created a total of 40,000 job opportunities in \r\nvarious sectors and provinces, with women comprising \r\n50 per cent of those benefiting from such loans. \r\n We have launched initiatives to assist low-income \r\nor unemployed persons in establishing start-up \r\nenterprises, and have established for that purpose a \r\nroyal prize, with the support of Queen Rania, to honour \r\nthe three best enterprises established. Jordan has \r\ncreated a national bank for small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises which will also combat poverty and \r\nunemployment and alleviate the burden of social \r\ndevelopment programmes by ensuring training and \r\nfinancing for citizens so they can become self-\r\nsufficient and undertake projects that will enable them \r\nto live in dignity. \r\n In addition to financing small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises, the Society sponsors other projects that \r\nwill assist us in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). These cover the areas of \r\nfamily, education, agribusiness, antidesertification \r\nefforts, health, poverty and unemployment. \r\n In conclusion, it is absolutely urgent for us to \r\nfind alternative and innovative sources of financing to \r\nreduce the adverse impacts of poverty on both the \r\neconomies and the national security of developing \r\ncountries. If our efforts are to be successful, we must \r\nensure that they are international and that they benefit \r\nfrom all the necessary coordination and harmonization. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nor Eddine Benfreha, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Algeria. \r\n Mr. Benfreha (Algeria) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statements made \r\nby the representative of Pakistan, on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and by the representative of \r\nBenin, on behalf of the Group of African States. We \r\nwish to make a few additional comments. \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n21 07-56108 \r\n \r\n Algeria attaches particular importance to the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on financing for development, \r\ngiven its constructive contribution to the preparations \r\nfor the Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development to Review the \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be \r\nheld in Doha in the second half of 2008. Our third \r\nHigh-level Dialogue is taking place in an international \r\ncontext that is being transformed by the multifaceted \r\neffects of globalization and that continues to reflect a \r\npersistent trend of disparities between the countries \r\nand regions of the world.  \r\n The Monterrey Conference is of great value in \r\nour planning to achieve the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It offers a framework for \r\nnational and international policies to ensure the \r\nimplementation of the measures necessary for \r\nfinancing for development. We believe that the record \r\nof the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, \r\ndespite the hope and the promises that it embodied, is \r\nthat we are far from fulfilling the commitments \r\nundertaken in the area of financing for development.  \r\n Certainly, some progress has been made in a \r\nnumber of areas related to development financing, \r\nwhile a slowness has characterized the honouring of \r\npartners’ commitments in several areas. We must \r\nredouble our efforts to agree on policies that could \r\ncontribute to optimal implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus in order to make up for the shortfall seen in \r\nits implementation. In that regard, our joint activities \r\nshould seek to consolidate and reinforce the results \r\nachieved and to achieve the full implementation of the \r\ncommitments undertaken within the framework of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus.  \r\n The 2005 World Summit clearly reaffirmed that \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus is the reference document of \r\nthe global partnership for development, which remains \r\nthe basis for growth without exclusion. To that end, we \r\nmust forge a global development partnership, guided \r\nby a collective multilateral discipline that can manage \r\nthe growing interdependence of economies and the \r\nresulting externalities and repercussions. The \r\nrestructuring of the international financial architecture \r\nhas not been completed. That requires a redoubling of \r\ninternational efforts to reorganize international \r\nfinancial governance so that it can ensure stability in \r\nfinancing for development. \r\n We are convinced that it is primarily up to \r\ndeveloping countries to mobilize national resources for \r\ndevelopment with a view to implementing the MDGs. \r\nIn that connection, Algeria has made sustained efforts \r\nin the area of development, and we are on track to \r\nachieve the international development goals. \r\n The results of national efforts to mobilize \r\nnational resources are closely tied to the current \r\nstructure of international financial governance. \r\nMoreover, the mobilization of international resources \r\nfor development remains very unequally distributed \r\nand official development assistance (ODA) is \r\ninsufficient, despite the many initiatives undertaken \r\nsince the Millennium Summit. \r\n Mobilizing external financing by increasing \r\ninternational capital flows to developing countries, \r\nconsolidating ODA at the desired level of 0.7 per cent \r\nof the gross domestic product of the economies of \r\ndeveloped countries and implementing commitments to \r\nrelieve external debt remain essential conditions for \r\naddressing the constraints related to financing for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n The nominal increase in ODA has not been \r\naccompanied by a time frame that could make such aid \r\npredictable, thereby contributing effectively to \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Furthermore, the inequitable development \r\nbetween the North and the South is accentuated by the \r\nnet transfer of financial resources towards the countries \r\nof the North. These trade surpluses result from the \r\ncurrent architecture of the international financial \r\nsystem and are a means of protection against the crises \r\nthat can arise in the area of external financing, as well \r\nas a way to maintain the financial equilibrium of the \r\ncountries concerned.  \r\n Despite the improvement in the external debt of a \r\nnumber of developing countries, thanks in particular to \r\nnational efforts and the Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries Debt Initiative, the economies of a \r\nsignificant number of countries continue to be \r\nsubjected to additional debt burdens and to their impact \r\non development.  \r\n Developing countries remain vulnerable to \r\nmonetary and financial crises, which can have grave \r\neffects on macroeconomic stability. The United \r\nNations system, in cooperation with the international \r\nfinancial institutions, can support the formulation and \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 22 \r\n \r\ncoordination of guidelines, based on a prudent \r\napproach, which could be agreed at the international \r\nlevel. Such measures should seek to protect developing \r\ncountries from recurrent financial upheavals. \r\nMoreover, participation by all developing countries in \r\nthe international financial institutions, reflecting more \r\nequitable representation, would undoubtedly help to \r\nstrengthen national ownership of decisive development \r\ndecisions.  \r\n It is of crucial importance to developing countries \r\nfor international trade to play its role as a driving force \r\nof development through the strengthening of ties \r\nbetween trade, development and financing. The \r\nsuspension of multilateral trade negotiations will not \r\nhave a positive effect on the commitments made and \r\nthe Doha Round of negotiations will thus not be a \r\nround of development. \r\n The forthcoming review of the Monterrey \r\nConference, which will take place in Doha in 2008, \r\nwill be the proper occasion for evaluating progress \r\nmade and for determining how to rise to the challenges \r\ntied to financing for development, bearing in mind the \r\nlessons learned since Monterrey. With this in mind, we \r\ncall for a development of synergies between all of the \r\nstakeholders in the development sphere and the \r\nstrengthening of interactions and consultations between \r\nthe United Nations and the international financial \r\ninstitutions as well as the World Trade Organization, in \r\norder to find the most appropriate ways to finance \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Francis Butagira, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Uganda. \r\n Mr. Butagira (Uganda): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, of Bangladesh on behalf of least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), and of Benin on behalf of \r\nthe African Group. \r\n As we begin to prepare for the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, Uganda welcomes this high-\r\nlevel event as a necessary catalyst for a decisive policy \r\ndiscussion during the preparatory process. \r\n A clear consensus has emerged on the urgent need \r\nfor increased flow of development resources to \r\ndeveloping countries in a predictable and stable \r\nmanner through official development assistance \r\n(ODA), trade, debt relief and foreign direct investment, \r\nif developing countries are to make any sustainable \r\nprogress towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Indeed, that was \r\nthe objective agreed upon at Monterrey. The concern of \r\nthe international community today is focused on the \r\nfact that this flow is not happening fast enough. My \r\ndelegation fully shares the G-77 position that there is \r\nurgent need to address the deficit in the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus as well as \r\nto focus our attention on issues that were not \r\nadequately addressed at Monterrey. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus was based on the \r\nunderstanding of a global compact between developing \r\ncountries and their development partners where neither \r\nside in the compact could escape responsibility for \r\ndelivering on its commitments. In that regard, \r\ndeveloping countries are to make increased efforts to \r\nimprove their situation and mobilize domestic \r\nresources as they work towards policy reforms and \r\nimproved governance. \r\n On the other hand, the international community, \r\nespecially the development partners, should also \r\nsupport the efforts of developing countries in a timely \r\nand efficient manner. However, the actual scenario is a \r\nmixture of stagnation and progress in some areas, with \r\ncritical deficiency of action in others. \r\n Uganda shares the common view that developing \r\ncountries bear the primary responsibility for their own \r\ndevelopment and that they should regard domestic \r\nresources as the first source of financing for \r\ndevelopment. It is therefore the role of the State to \r\nfacilitate the flow of investment and trade, as well as to \r\nengage in social development and infrastructure \r\ncreation. \r\n Like many other developing countries, Uganda \r\nhas tried to live up to its commitment to adopt and \r\ntransparently implement comprehensive national \r\nstrategies to reach MDGs targets. This includes the \r\nformulation of MDG-based national development \r\nstrategies that are now the basis for the allocation of all \r\ndevelopment resources whether internally or externally \r\nmobilized. \r\n To enhance the effectiveness of these resources, \r\nUganda guarantees reasonable, just, transparent and \r\nstable market regulations to private investors. Well-\r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n23 07-56108 \r\n \r\ndefined development policies have been put in place \r\nwhich clearly outline the resources needed for each \r\naction to be taken. \r\n Continuous efforts are being made by the \r\nGovernment to make the domestic economy more \r\nattractive to investors by directing efforts towards \r\ndevelopment of the transport, energy and \r\ncommunications sectors. \r\n The use of microcredit in addressing poverty is \r\nbeing explored with increasing success. We believe \r\nthat the development of the microfinance industry will \r\nhelp to generate resources for development by bringing \r\nrural communities into national community \r\nparticipation. The Government is also trying to widen \r\nthe tax base and pursue progressive taxes in an effort to \r\ndevelop the capacity to raise domestic resources for \r\ndevelopment. Engaging the private sector and civil \r\nsociety has been a key factor in making the economy \r\nmore productive. \r\n The focus of international attention has now \r\nshifted from making commitments to how the \r\ncommitments already made are being delivered. This is \r\none critical area that was not adequately addressed in \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus. At Monterrey, there were no \r\noutstanding commitments on financing to talk about. \r\nBut since Monterrey, a lot of support has been \r\npromised to developing countries through commitments \r\nmade by development partners. Much of that support \r\nstill remains to be delivered, how soon it will be \r\ndelivered is presently the main cause of concern. \r\n While the trend of significant increases in ODA \r\nto developing countries was sustained in 2004 and \r\n2005, much of the observed increases continue to take \r\nthe form of emergency aid, debt relief and technical \r\nassistance, which do not necessarily mean financial \r\ntransfer to developing countries. This is another point \r\nof great concern to developing countries that brings to \r\nmind the question of what kind of flows should be \r\nconsidered as development aid. However, the current \r\nand projected levels of ODA for the period 2006-2010 \r\nstill fall short of targets. \r\n There is need for concrete mechanisms to follow \r\nup on commitments made by development partners \r\nwith the possibility of holding them accountable for the \r\nshortfalls in commitments to increase aid to developing \r\ncountries. Developing countries should not be made to \r\nbase their development plans on false expectations. \r\nAccountability should be a requirement for both sides \r\nin the global development compact. Why should it not? \r\n We believe that the United Nations has a key role \r\nto play in support of developing countries’ vision and \r\nplans, and to help them build the necessary capacity, \r\nskills and institutions for mobilizing domestic \r\nresources. At the same time, the United Nations, \r\nthrough its Economic and Social Council, should \r\ncontinue to monitor efforts to increase aid, especially \r\nits effectiveness, to developing countries. \r\n The Doha Development Round of trade \r\nnegotiations, despite setbacks and suspension, still \r\noffer a unique opportunity to support development and \r\nit should not be allowed to fail. My own President, His \r\nExcellency Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, has always said \r\nthat we do not need aid; what we need is trade and \r\nmarket access. Trade is the most significant tool for \r\ngenerating growth because the income derived from \r\ntrade is a sustainable form of financing for \r\ndevelopment. However, many developing countries \r\nstill lag behind in trade, especially the LDCs, with the \r\nlandlocked among them being the most deprived. \r\n Last year, developed countries made several aid \r\nfor trade commitments aimed at helping developing \r\ncountries expand their capacity to export. But fulfilling \r\nthose commitments is only one thing. Free access to \r\nexport markets is badly needed and still awaits the \r\nresumption and successful completion of the Doha \r\ntrade negotiations under the World Trade Organization. \r\n Developing countries have great potential for \r\nmobilizing investment from the growing diaspora. \r\nDiaspora remittances could constitute the second \r\nlargest source of capital inflows after foreign direct \r\ninvestment. But that potential is not being fully \r\nexploited, owing to legal and funding barriers to \r\nremittances and other financial flows from migrants. \r\nHowever, while we continue to seek alternative sources \r\nof financing for development, such mechanisms should \r\nnot be proposed as the ultimate solution to financing \r\nfor development, substituting for traditional forms of \r\nofficial development assistance, debt relief or trade-\r\nrelated measures that would help promote growth in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n South-South cooperation provides an important \r\nopportunity for developing countries to mobilize \r\nresources at both the domestic and the regional levels. \r\nThe promotion of South-South cooperation will \r\nunleash the potential of emerging economies in the \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 24 \r\n \r\nSouth to provide development funding, either as donors \r\nor through trade. \r\n Let me conclude by emphasizing that recognizing \r\nthe need to seriously consider alternative sources of \r\nfinancing for development is already a top priority. \r\nEach year lost in the effort to provide financing for \r\ndevelopment represents an increase in the resources \r\nneeded in the run-up to 2015. This High-level Dialogue \r\nshould serve to galvanize the will of the international \r\ncommunity to take decisive action on this critical issue \r\nof development. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Hindi Abdulatif, chairman of the delegation of the \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya. \r\n Mr. Abdulatif (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Pakistan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the \r\nrepresentative of Benin on behalf of the African Group.  \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on follow-up \r\nto and implementation of the Monterrey Consensus \r\n(A/62/217) is precise, clear and comprehensive \r\nregarding progress and failures in reforming the \r\ninternational financial architecture. The report \r\ncoincides with reports on crises in foreign \r\nindebtedness, development and international trade, and \r\nother relevant reports. All of those reports confirm that \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) has not become a reality, least of all in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa.  \r\n Although the economies of a number of \r\ndeveloping countries performed well in 2006, many \r\nother developing countries are still highly vulnerable to \r\nrecent accelerated changes in financial markets and \r\ncommodity prices. It has become abundantly clear that \r\nthe crises to which world financial markets are exposed \r\nhave inflicted transboundary damages and are having a \r\nnegative impact on the realization of the MDGs in \r\ndeveloping countries. In fact, the world economy is \r\nbeing held hostage by those crises.  \r\n Intervention by the central banks of developed \r\ncountries is not sufficient; what is needed is a change \r\nin fiscal policies to deal with the structural imbalances \r\nin the world financial systems. It is now absolutely \r\nnecessary to establish a world multilateral system in \r\nwhich developing countries can effectively participate, \r\nso that the necessary macroeconomic balance can be \r\nachieved in developing countries and developed \r\ncountries alike.  \r\n The follow-up to the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus requires an effective multilateral \r\nmechanism and the establishment of a partnership \r\npromoting cooperation between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries and mainstreaming a \r\ndevelopment perspective in operational policies and \r\nprocedures for finance, indebtedness and trade, also \r\ntaking into account the regional dimension in \r\nimplementing the Consensus. It should also build new \r\nrelations among the United Nations system, the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization, the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \r\ninternational and regional financial institutions and the \r\nprivate sector. In that context, we highly appreciate the \r\nimportant special high-level meeting of the Economic \r\nand Social Council with international trade and \r\nfinancial institutions on financing for development, \r\nwhich was held in New York on 16 April 2007. \r\n We hope that this work will continue with the \r\neffective participation of all development stakeholders \r\nand in accordance with the standards that we all seek: \r\ngood governance, performance, efficiency, transparency, \r\naccountability and effective efforts to combat \r\ncorruption through the implementation of the United \r\nNations Convention against Corruption.  \r\n Bilateral and multilateral relations in the field of \r\nfinancing for development have both undergone \r\npositive development and encountered challenges since \r\nthe 2002 International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. As a result, responsible assessment is \r\nrequired in order to find solutions and innovative \r\nmechanisms that would give momentum to the work of \r\nthe forthcoming Doha Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. We hope that the Conference outcomes \r\nwill renew our commitment to implement what has \r\nbeen agreed upon and to establish a governmental \r\nmechanism for implementation and follow-up, as we \r\nhave previously proposed. \r\n The Doha Round of development negotiations has \r\nreached an impasse because the developed countries \r\nare still insisting on their positions regarding free trade \r\nfor development. We call on our development partners \r\nto cooperate, to evaluate our common interests and to \r\nprovide a new opportunity to build a fairer, better \r\nbalanced international trading system, where markets \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n25 07-56108 \r\n \r\nare open to developing countries and which is free \r\nfrom double standards and selectivity.  \r\n My country is concerned about the economic \r\nsituation in Africa because we are part of that \r\ngeopolitical region, in addition to our Mediterranean \r\nand Arab links. We note with great interest that United \r\nNations activities in the Second Committee have \r\nconcentrated on the difficulties facing the African \r\ncontinent in attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals as a result of profound distortions in the African \r\npolitical economy and of the violence and instability \r\nthere, which are factors that impede development.  \r\n The report recently issued by several \r\nnon-governmental organizations entitled “Africa’s \r\nmissing billions” concluded that Africa has lost \r\napproximately $300 billion as a result of armed \r\nconflict during the period from 1990 to 2005, thus \r\nexceeding the assistance received by the continent. \r\nThat constitutes a very urgent call, in particular on all \r\nAfricans, to widen our perspective on financing for \r\ndevelopment and to make it more comprehensive, to \r\nencompass more than financial concessions and \r\nassistance.  \r\n We highly appreciate Secretary-General Ban Ki-\r\nmoon’s initiative to establish the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Africa Steering Group, which will \r\ndirectly deliver aid for educational and health projects, \r\ninfrastructure, agricultural and food security. That will \r\nrequire an environment conducive to national and \r\nregional economic growth through increased foreign \r\nofficial development assistance, which unfortunately \r\ndeclined in 2006. It might continue to shrink unless \r\ndonor countries reconsider their position on this \r\nimportant component of financing for development. \r\n We welcome the World Development Report \r\n2008, recently published by the World Bank, which \r\ndraws upon the work of World Bank experts assigned \r\nto evaluate the Bank’s role in financing agriculture in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. That important report highlights \r\nthe clear fact that for years there has been consistent \r\nneglect of agricultural projects. It also implicitly \r\nrecognizes the failure of policies based on removing \r\nagriculture from the public sector and handing it over \r\nto the private sector. The Bank imposed such policies \r\non African Governments throughout the 1980s and \r\n1990s, including by reducing financing from \r\n$419 million in 1991 to $123 million in 2000. When \r\nthe Bank realized the gravity of the results of its policy, \r\nit began to increase its financing — to $295 million in \r\n2005 and to $695 million in 2006.  \r\n The report also emphasizes that African \r\nGovernments must allocate more of their budgets to \r\nagriculture. That emphasizes what we, as African and \r\ndeveloping countries, have rightly been calling for in \r\nnot accepting ready-made prescriptions by donor \r\nexperts or conditionalities. Rather, we must respect \r\nnational ownership and development priorities, as well \r\nas regional and internal circumstances. \r\n As a developing country, Libya understands the \r\nvalue of South-South cooperation and urges its \r\nexpansion, particularly in the fields of finance, trade, \r\ninvestment and science and technology. We hope that \r\nthe day will come when such cooperation will take a \r\npriority position rather than a complementary position \r\nvis-à-vis North-South cooperation. \r\n My country reaffirms the responsibility of \r\ndeveloped countries, in particular the Group of Eight \r\n(G-8), to fulfil their commitments and promises. We \r\nalso call on the financial institutions and all of our \r\ndevelopment partners to enhance multilateral \r\ncooperation through the machinery of the United \r\nNations system and to create innovative mechanisms \r\nfor financing multilateral projects. \r\n We commend the initiatives taken within the \r\nArab, African, Asian, Latin American and Islamic \r\ngroups to finance small and medium-sized enterprises, \r\nin particular through international and regional \r\nfinancial institutions, such as the African Development \r\nBank and the Islamic Development Bank. \r\n On the other hand, my country notes with alarm \r\nthe increase in net financial flows from developing to \r\ndeveloped countries in 2006 for the tenth consecutive \r\nyear. The current international financial structures and \r\nthe poor development circumstances and corruption in \r\na number of countries of the South encourage this \r\nincreased flow, which reached $600 billion in 2006.  \r\n We also note that, although they have been \r\nincreasing, nearly 70 per cent of foreign financial \r\nflows towards developing countries have benefited \r\n12 countries, in particular in the field of raw materials, \r\nspecifically oil, and bond and security markets. The \r\nlatter is particularly sensitive to external volatility and \r\nexternal threats. We must be cautious in this field \r\nbecause it is often an arena for opportunistic \r\nspeculation rather than stability. \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 26 \r\n \r\n Foreign direct investment is an important \r\ncontributor to financing for development in developing \r\ncountries in general, since domestic financial resources \r\nfor development are limited and rates of saving are also \r\nweak. Financial markets are still emerging. It would be \r\nvery useful for development if a new international \r\nmachinery were created to encourage investors to \r\ninvest in developing countries. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Jorge Urbina Ortega, the chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Costa Rica. \r\n Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation wishes to thank the Organization for \r\nconvening this High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. It is important that the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, which will take place in Qatar, should \r\ndetermine what progress has been made since the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and reaffirm its goals and \r\nobjectives. It is vital that the Conference, and its \r\npreparatory process, develop new ideas and new \r\napproaches that will ensure progress towards the \r\ninternational development goals, including the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n In that context, I wish to refer in particular to the \r\nsituation of middle-income countries with regard to \r\ninternational technical and financial cooperation. As a \r\nresult of the progress achieved due to those efforts — \r\nprogress that is still recent — my country has \r\nexperienced a gradual and systematic reduction in \r\nresources received in the context of international \r\ncooperation for development. In general terms, the \r\ndeveloped countries have tended to exclude Costa Rica \r\nand other countries in similar circumstances from the \r\nlist of those countries benefiting from international \r\nassistance and from the debt cancellation mechanisms \r\nestablished by the international financial institutions.  \r\n Our situation is not unique. It has occurred in \r\nspite of the fact that, according to a 2007 World Bank \r\nreport, 30 per cent of the world population living on \r\nless than two dollars a day still resides in middle-\r\nincome countries. \r\n In our view, it is essential to go beyond the \r\nconcept of gross national product, because it does not \r\ntake into account a number of factors that affect the \r\ndevelopment process, such as levels of inequality and \r\nsocial, institutional, financial and production \r\ndisadvantages. Thus, we must take into account other \r\nvariables when we consider who should receive credit \r\nand international assistance, for example those related \r\nto the efforts and advances made in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.  \r\n Those elements and others relating to trade, \r\nfinancial stability and democratic governance are of \r\ngreat importance concerning the theme of financing for \r\ndevelopment. They are set forth in the reports of the \r\ninternational Conferences on Development Cooperation \r\nwith Middle-income Countries, which took place this \r\nyear in Spain and in El Salvador. We recommend that \r\ndelegations read and consider those reports.  \r\n Innovative sources of financing are a matter of \r\nparticular importance to my delegation. These have \r\ngradually entered the overall debate on the subject and \r\nare now recognized by most Member States as an \r\nimportant aspect of financing for development. \r\nAccordingly, let me once more put forward for the \r\nconsideration of the Assembly the Costa Rican \r\nGovernment initiative known as the Costa Rica \r\nConsensus. This is an innovative financing mechanism \r\nintended not to replace but rather to complement \r\nofficial development assistance. The Costa Rica \r\nConsensus appeals to all developing countries to make \r\nevery effort to invest their limited public resources to \r\nmeet the most urgent social needs, including those \r\nidentified in the Millennium Development Goals, and \r\nto reduce their military expenditures. Similarly, the \r\nCosta Rica Consensus appeals to donor countries to \r\nincorporate in their official development assistance \r\n(ODA) programmes certain incentives to compensate \r\nthose developing countries that, in a verifiable and \r\nsustainable way, make effective efforts to engage in \r\nsocial investments and reduce military expenses.  \r\n Costa Rica does not doubt that there are \r\nlegitimate security concerns in certain developing \r\ncountries, which justify military expenses in keeping \r\nwith those concerns. But we would say that we are \r\nconcerned over the fact that in 2006 the world hit a \r\nnew record — $1.2 trillion was spent on military \r\nexpenses. With just a tenth of those resources, we \r\nwould have achieved the goal for 2006 for all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) for all the \r\ncountries of the world.  \r\n We would like to take advantage of our gathering \r\nin this High-level Dialogue to call upon the donor \r\ncountries to create mechanisms for reducing foreign \r\ndebt, either by forgiveness or renegotiation of \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n27 07-56108 \r\n \r\nexchange, non-reimbursable contributions, or loans \r\nwith subsidized interest rates to reward and incentivize \r\npeace dividends.  \r\n We urge the international community to breathe \r\nlife into the Costa Rica Consensus. It should be \r\nunderstood that the Consensus is not designed to create \r\nimpossible conditionalities, but to seek to provide \r\nincentives for a more ethical management of available \r\npublic resources. \r\n Finally, we hope that what delegations have said \r\nbefore this plenary and in the six roundtables of this \r\nDialogue become important inputs in the preparatory \r\nstages for Doha and we pledge our commitment to \r\nwork toward the success of that Conference. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Daniel Carmon, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Israel. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): At the outset, allow me to \r\ncongratulate the President on his leadership of the \r\nAssembly and to thank him for convening this \r\nimportant High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. \r\n Since the adoption of the 2002 Monterrey \r\nConsensus of the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development, macroeconomic and fiscal \r\nmanagement have improved in the majority of \r\ndeveloping countries. Other improvements can also be \r\nseen in the progress of financial sector development \r\nand external debt indicators. With this, there has been a \r\ndocumented rise in social expenditures per capita, the \r\nshare of the poor in the total world population is \r\nreceding, debt relief programmes are expanding, and \r\nmore investment opportunities are being created. \r\n The United Nations has taken a leadership role in \r\ncoordinating financing efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to ensure achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), specifically the \r\neradication of hunger and mitigation of poverty. \r\n In line with these endeavours, Israel has \r\nredoubled its work in the field of financing for \r\ndevelopment, in the form of partnerships within the \r\nUnited Nations system and through its cooperative \r\npartnerships and bilateral programmes run by \r\nMASHAV — the Centre for International Cooperation \r\nof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of \r\nIsrael — and in official development assistance (ODA) \r\ndisbursements. \r\n Israel expresses its strong support for the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, which reflects a broad-based \r\ndevelopment approach that includes sound \r\nmacroeconomic policies aimed at sustaining high rates \r\nof economic growth, full employment, poverty \r\nreduction, price stability, and sustainable fiscal and \r\nexternal accounts. Moreover, the Monterrey Consensus \r\nsought to move us forward, together, in securing the \r\nfundamental common cause of the United Nations of \r\ncreating a true global partnership in which the \r\ninternational community can work to achieve the \r\nMDGs and the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals. \r\n Having reached the latter half of the time frame \r\nallotted to achieve the MDGs, the need for consensus \r\nis further impressed upon us. But, as we are lagging \r\nbehind the timetable, Israel hopes that Member States \r\nwill undertake the agreements put forth in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus with renewed vigour, in order to \r\nachieve the MDGs by the target date. \r\n Since financing for development depends heavily \r\non the mobilization of both domestic and international \r\nfunds towards development, the efficacy, coherence, \r\nand consistency of sound macroeconomic policies in \r\ndeveloping countries must remain a priority. The \r\nresulting attractive, stable and predictable investment \r\nclimate will enhance the inflow of productive capital. \r\n On the local level, national policies and \r\nmechanisms should be geared towards attracting \r\nprivate sector investment and the building of a market \r\neconomy. Similarly, obstacles to growth should be \r\nremoved, as trade and investment are instrumental to a \r\nrobust market economy. Such policies not only make \r\nthe market more attractive to investors, but also have \r\nthe benefit of guarding against corruption and help \r\nfacilitate and implement good governance. \r\n In addition to its bilateral aid and programmes \r\nthrough MASHAV, Israel actively supports \r\ninternational initiatives such as the World Bank’s \r\nInternational Development Association programmes \r\nand the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative \r\nprogramme for debt reduction. Israel has already \r\nparticipated in such projects for a number of African \r\ncountries, and will continue to consider additional debt \r\nrelief, to the extent that resources allow. \r\n We look forward to the follow-up on the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to be held in Doha, Qatar, in 2008, which \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 28 \r\n \r\nwill provide a forum for Member States to realign and \r\nmaximize cooperation. To preserve the spirit of \r\nMonterrey, we must move together by consensus and \r\nreaffirm our commitments. \r\n As a former emerging economy now on track to \r\njoin the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD), Israel recognizes the \r\nimportance of broadened trade horizons in economic \r\ndevelopment. Like other OECD member countries, \r\nIsrael shares the same attachment to the basic values of \r\nopen markets and democratic pluralism. Israel is \r\nwilling and able to comply with the OECD’s \r\ndisciplines and can provide greater mutual benefit by \r\ncontributing to the work of subsidiary bodies. \r\n In this regard, Israel encourages OECD members \r\nto increase ODA disbursements. ODA is an important \r\ncomplement to domestic resources and other sources of \r\nfinancing for development, with the capacity to \r\nenergize and leverage private resources from domestic \r\nand international sources. Similarly, Israel has a long-\r\nstanding commitment to Africa and the least developed \r\ncountries, having begun its first partnerships in Ghana \r\nin 1957. As I mentioned in this Hall a few days ago \r\n(see A/62/PV.28), Israel will continue to evaluate and \r\nredefine these partnerships in the light of profound \r\ndevelopments on the African continent. \r\n We are carefully following the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round, and encourage those negotiations \r\nto wrap up as soon as possible. The success of this \r\nRound depends on a balanced outcome. Trade is the \r\nchief external source of development financing, \r\npromoting economic growth and employment both in \r\nthe developing and the partner country. \r\n In the coming year, MASHAV will celebrate its \r\nfiftieth anniversary. Since its establishment, MASHAV \r\nhas worked in partnership with more than \r\n120 countries, as well as international organizations, \r\ncivil society and the business sector on programmes \r\ndesigned to assist in meeting development challenges \r\nin such areas as food security, agriculture, water and \r\nsanitation, education, gender, community development \r\nand public health. \r\n Israel emphasizes the need for broad participation \r\nof all stakeholders in each respective country’s \r\ndevelopment, and encourages all sectors of society to \r\nplay their roles. Partnerships based on the participation \r\nof the public and private sector and civil society are \r\nimportant to efforts to increase ownership of \r\ndevelopment planning, initiatives and goals. \r\n Seven years into the twenty-first century, \r\nrestructuring the international financial architecture to \r\nrespond to profound changes in the global economy \r\nremains an important, albeit unfinished, agenda. The \r\nworld economy is developing and rapidly changing, \r\nwhich means that the challenges and opportunities of \r\nglobalization are here already. \r\n As we look towards the Doha Conference in \r\n2008, we are reminded of our commitment to reaching \r\nthe MDGs by 2015. Though a number of initiatives and \r\npartnerships have been launched to achieve the Goals, \r\nonly through the true spirit of partnership enshrined in \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus can the challenges and \r\nobstacles facing us collectively be overcome and \r\nfulfilled by all. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Claude Heller, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Mexico. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation thanks the President for convening this \r\nimportant meeting and for his commitment to the \r\nfollow-up process of the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development. Under his leadership, and \r\nwith the contribution of the ambassadors of Egypt and \r\nNorway as co-facilitators, we will certainly achieve \r\nsubstantive results and make headway on the process \r\ntowards the Conference in Doha. \r\n In addition, my delegation associates itself with \r\nthe statement made on behalf of the Rio Group by the \r\ndelegation of Chile, in its capacity as coordinator for \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. We also thank the Dominican Republic \r\nfor its role as pro tempore secretary of the Group. \r\n My delegation also thanks the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report on the implementation of the results of \r\nthe International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment (A/62/217). That document presents an \r\nupdated, balanced and complete vision of the status of \r\nthe various chapters of the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nwhich have been useful in preparing for our \r\nparticipation in the round tables. We note that it will be \r\nan important contribution to the substantive \r\ndiscussions that will culminate in the Doha \r\nConference. \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n29 07-56108 \r\n \r\n Mexico believes that the result of the process we \r\nare undertaking must be to promote the most effective \r\nstrategies and actions, on all fronts, to generate and \r\nmobilize the financial resources on the national, \r\nregional and international levels that are necessary to \r\nbuild a favourable economic environment at all levels \r\nand that allows us to promote sustainable development. \r\n In order to achieve that, Mexico believes that our \r\ndiscussions must be based on the principle of \r\nflexibility. We are already halfway between the \r\nMillennium Summit and the year 2015, and we know \r\nwith certainty that the progress made towards the \r\nachievement of development for all has been uneven \r\nand insufficient. Consequently, Mexico considers that \r\nwe must continue blazing the trail, keeping in mind \r\nthat the objective is not the realization of an event in \r\nitself, but that our efforts achieve the greatest possible \r\nimpact. \r\n My delegation believes that the discussions on \r\nthe way forward will be enriched if we consider the \r\nfollowing factors. The preparation process and the \r\nDoha Conference itself must be inclusive, actively \r\ninvolving all relevant actors in financing for \r\ndevelopment, namely the international financial \r\ninstitutions; regional and subregional entities; civil \r\nsociety, including academia, the private sector and \r\nsocial organizations; and the international agencies that \r\nspecialize in issues relevant for development, both \r\ninside and outside the United Nations system. \r\n Similarly, Mexico recommends that we carefully \r\nreflect on the most appropriate date for the Conference, \r\nwith a view to maximizing its potential for impact. \r\n Mexico believes that, given the high technical \r\nlevel of the discussion, it is practically impossible to \r\nexhaust, or even to discuss to the required extent, each \r\nsection of the Consensus. The holding of round tables \r\nsuch as those established for this occasion is extremely \r\nuseful, but undoubtedly insufficient. For that reason, \r\nmy delegation considers that consultations, including \r\nexpert-level consultations, are indispensable in the \r\npreparations for the Doha Conference, so that each \r\nsection of the Monterrey Consensus can be dealt with \r\nindividually, taking into account new issues of \r\nincreasing relevance for development. \r\n Mexico does not deem it advisable to renegotiate \r\nthe content of the Monterrey Consensus. From our \r\npoint of view, that document reflects the collective will \r\nof the international community to build a solid \r\nfoundation for development from a broad perspective. \r\nThe most praiseworthy achievement of the document \r\nwas, perhaps, to shape this common will, highlighting \r\nthe possibilities for finding common elements in our \r\ndiversity. \r\n In that spirit, we believe that revisiting the \r\nMonterrey Consensus would be useful only if we \r\nwould strengthen and renew this common vision. \r\nTherefore Mexico thinks it is not only important to \r\nreview what has been achieved in fulfilling the agreed \r\nobjectives and renewing our commitments, but also to \r\ninclude subjects that are of strategic importance. \r\n For that purpose, Mexico considers it necessary \r\nto establish adequate coordination between the various \r\ninitiatives and future meetings dealing with items \r\nrelated to development. From my country’s \r\nperspective, such a connection is inherent to the \r\ncontent of the Monterrey Consensus and becomes \r\nevident in formulating questions such as the following. \r\n How can we finance the indispensable efforts to \r\ndeal with the effects of climate change, particularly \r\nmeasures to adapt to and mitigate its effects, including \r\nthe transfer of technologies? What effective measures \r\ncan be taken to satisfy the specific financing needs of \r\ncountries and regions that, according to current trends, \r\nwill not achieve the Millennium Development Goals? \r\nWhich strategies and actions can the international \r\ncommunity propose and apply to support the efforts of \r\nmiddle-income countries — in which 40 per cent of the \r\nworld’s poor population lives — for the eradication of \r\npoverty? How can we maximize the impact and \r\nminimize the negative effects of trade openness \r\nthrough the mobilization of national and international \r\nresources? \r\n We must recognize that each one of those areas \r\nhas its own specialized forums and mechanisms, and \r\nthe objective here is not to replace them nor to find \r\nglobal solutions. Nevertheless, given the holistic and \r\ncrosscutting perspective of the Monterrey Consensus, it \r\nwould be logical to apply the wealth of knowledge and \r\nexperience acquired since the signing of the Consensus \r\nto the efforts of the international community in those \r\nareas, particularly within the United Nations system. \r\n It is my delegation’s view that, in order to \r\nprovide a more effective follow-up to the efforts \r\nundertaken thus far and to face new items and \r\nchallenges, it would be useful to strengthen the follow-\r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 30 \r\n \r\nup mechanism for the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus within the Secretariat. \r\n The political interest that the Conference is able \r\nto garner will depend on the perception we project of \r\nits timeliness, its long-term vision and its usefulness. \r\nMy delegation believes that if we set the most \r\nappropriate date, include all the relevant actors, \r\ncontribute substantially to the key events that will take \r\nplace between now and the Conference and renew our \r\ncommitment to achieving our common goals, we will \r\ninevitably generate the highest expectations. \r\n The President of the Assembly can count on the \r\ndelegation of Mexico to support him in this effort. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abderrahim Ould Hadrami, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Mauritania. \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I shall follow the recommendation to be brief. \r\nMy country’s delegation welcomes the holding of this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. \r\nMy country associates itself with the statements made \r\nby the representative of Benin on behalf of the African \r\nGroup and by the representative of Pakistan on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China. We wish to congratulate \r\nthe Secretary-General on his excellent report on the \r\nfollow-up to the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus (A/62/217), and thank him for the timely \r\nrecommendations it contains.  \r\n The 2002 International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development and the Monterrey Consensus reached \r\nthere demonstrate the grave concern of the \r\ninternational community regarding the worrisome gap \r\nbetween North and South in terms of well-being and \r\nsocial progress. We welcome that new-found awareness \r\nand hope that, henceforth, bold and innovative \r\nmeasures will be undertaken and swiftly implemented \r\nin the daily lives of our populations.  \r\n But, we must note that, five years after \r\nMonterrey, much remains to be done. That is why it is \r\nmore necessary than ever before to persevere in our \r\ncommitments. My country’s delegation subscribes \r\ncompletely to the call by the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, on donor countries to honour all of \r\nthe commitments they have undertaken in the area of \r\ndevelopment and to urgently increase the global \r\nvolume of aid flows in order to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n My country welcomes the convening, in 2008 in \r\nDoha, of the Follow-up International Conference on \r\nthe implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, and \r\nwe hope it will be successful. We have great hope for \r\nthat forum’s potential for discovering new and \r\neffective paths for financing for development. \r\n The present High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment is a good opportunity for my country to \r\nshare recent developments in our country which have \r\nbrought prosperity and social progress to the people of \r\nMauritania. In recent months, we have witnessed the \r\nculmination of the country’s process of transition to \r\ndemocracy and pluralism, after a transitional period of \r\nbarely a year and a half. That has enabled us to put an \r\nend to the succession of monolithic systems that has \r\nprevailed in Mauritania since independence, and to \r\nestablish a healthy basis for democracy.  \r\n Today, my country has legitimate republican \r\ninstitutions and representatives chosen by the people in \r\nfull sovereignty, through elections recognized by all as \r\ntransparent and fair. We can be legitimately proud of \r\nthis. But we are also called to action, since our \r\ndemocracy will remain fragile until its institutions have \r\nundertaken the necessary actions to improve, in \r\ntangible terms, the living conditions of our population.  \r\n Democracy and stability are never absolute; they \r\ncan become sustainable and durable only in societies \r\nthat make progress. That is why it is now urgent for \r\nMauritania to have immediate access to the resources \r\nthat would enable us to embark on the right track \r\ntowards development.  \r\n In that context, the Mauritanian authorities in \r\npower since April 2007 have undertaken urgent \r\nmeasures and formulated a development plan for the \r\nnext three years. This emergency plan, inspired by the \r\nspirit and principles of the Monterrey Consensus, aims \r\nat alleviating the suffering of our people through \r\nresolute and accelerated progress towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.  \r\n The Mauritanian authorities will give absolute \r\npriority to the following activities: building national \r\nunity through the return of Mauritanian refugees who \r\nare living outside the country due to the severe \r\nshortcomings in human rights enforcement in the \r\ncountry in past years, and eradicating the consequences \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n31 07-56108 \r\n \r\nof slavery; investing in human resources, including \r\nthrough improving education, health and vocational \r\ntraining; establishing infrastructure to support growth \r\nand job creation, in particular through energy \r\nproduction and facilitating trade exchanges through \r\nimprovements in transport infrastructure; improving \r\naccess to basic services; and ensuring the balanced \r\ndevelopment of our national territory.  \r\n To implement that plan, the Mauritanian \r\nGovernment has identified all domestic resources that \r\ncan be mobilized in the next few years and all \r\ninternational financing available to our country today. \r\nMy country counts on the solidarity of the international \r\ncommunity in mobilizing the remaining funds needed \r\nfor our development plan, currently amounting to \r\n$1.3 billion.  \r\n With the active support of all of its partners, in \r\nparticular the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, the European Union and the World Bank, \r\nmy country will organize a meeting of the consultative \r\ngroup, to be held in Paris from 4 to 6 December 2007. I \r\ntake this opportunity to express my country’s sincere \r\ngratitude to our development partners for their \r\ncooperation and their support, and to express our desire \r\nto see all development partners and donors contribute \r\nfully to mobilizing the financial resources necessary \r\nfor the implementation of our development plan and \r\nfor relaunching national reconstruction in Mauritania. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Aura Mahuampi Rodríguez \r\nde Ortiz, chairperson of the delegation of Venezuela. \r\n Ms. Rodríguez de Ortiz (Venezuela) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): In the first few years of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, United Nations Member States and members \r\nof the World Trade Organization reached agreement, in \r\nthe Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus \r\nand in the Doha Ministerial Declaration of the Fourth \r\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO), on international strategies that \r\nhad as their primary focus the development needs of \r\ndeveloping countries. The agreements were reached \r\nafter difficult and lengthy negotiating processes. There \r\nwas no lack of pressure and attempts at compulsion by \r\nsome members of the international community.  \r\n Since the Monterrey Conference, poverty, \r\ninequality and social exclusion continue to be \r\nundesirable realities, requiring effective political will \r\nto eliminate them and create conditions that take into \r\naccount the diversity of all of our countries’ alternative \r\napproaches to development. We must note that \r\nalthough the changes necessary for achieving \r\ndevelopment goals were highlighted at Monterrey, \r\nthere is no single or universal approach to that \r\nproblem. Results will depend on both the developed \r\nand the developing countries sharing responsibilities.  \r\n We must recall the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination. In accordance with that right, peoples \r\nare entitled to freely define their political status and \r\nachieve economic, social and cultural development. \r\nThe mobilization of national financial resources for \r\ndevelopment requires that the political opportunities of \r\ndeveloping countries be preserved and expanded, so \r\nthat they can fulfil their primary duty of creating \r\nfavourable conditions for development.  \r\n This means that the State must be able to plan, \r\nexecute and evaluate the broadest range of public \r\npolicies, on the understanding that development is a \r\ncross-cutting subject, affecting all social relations. In \r\norder to make optimal use of national resources, States \r\nhave an essential role to play in guiding the \r\ndevelopment process. Although public-private alliances \r\ncan be one way among many to finance development, \r\nprivate interests that focus solely on profits cannot \r\ncreate the best conditions to achieve general \r\ndevelopment goals.  \r\n Fair prices must be set and respected in the sale \r\nof our raw materials, and our means of production must \r\nbe reinvigorated in line with clear national \r\ndevelopment goals, in order to mobilize national \r\nresources to achieve development goals. Such efforts \r\nare a sine qua non for development.  \r\n With regard to mobilizing international resources \r\nfor development, an environment conducive to \r\ninvestment must be established, one that avoids the \r\nmany risks posed by the inequalities arising from \r\nglobalization. In that respect, we must establish \r\nnational and international regulations that strengthen \r\nsocial safety nets, increase security and social stability, \r\npreserve and expand decent, dignified working \r\nconditions and preserve the environment. For that \r\nreason, an environment conducive to national and \r\nforeign investment must be created and must be based \r\non the will of our people, who are demanding that \r\ndevelopment and will be the ones to benefit from it.  \r\n Despite the efforts that have been made by \r\ndeveloping countries, developed countries must abide \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 32 \r\n \r\nby their commitment to allot 0.7 per cent of their gross \r\nnational income to official development assistance, \r\nwithout conditionalities. They must increase the \r\ncapacity of developing countries to take part in the \r\ndecision-making process of international financial \r\ninstitutions. And they must also significantly reduce \r\nthe burden of foreign debt. It is urgent that we take into \r\naccount the fact that without real democratization of \r\nthe systems governing international finance and \r\nassistance, it will not be possible to maintain \r\nconsistency in development efforts, and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals set for 2015 will not \r\nbe achieved. We must also recognize that we need to \r\nreview the factors that have caused multilateral trade \r\nnegotiations to become bogged down. These highlight \r\nthe many major contradictions between trade and \r\ndevelopment and even endanger the very legitimacy of \r\nthe multilateral trade system.  \r\n We are convinced that it is necessary to \r\nstrengthen South-South cooperation. The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela has taken such steps in \r\nfinancial, energy-related, humanitarian and social areas \r\nin order to promote the development of our people.  \r\n In the financial realm, we have made significant \r\nprogress in creating mechanisms to promote financial \r\ncooperation and integration. We have created new \r\nfinancial institutions focused on social issues, the best \r\nexample of which is the Bank of the South. For their \r\npart, Petrocaribe, Petrosur and Petroamerica are all \r\nplatforms for cooperation aimed at meeting the energy \r\nneeds of many developing countries in our region. We \r\nhave forged many alliances with the State enterprises \r\nof Latin America and Asia. At the same time, we have \r\nintensified our cooperation with Africa.  \r\n In the social arena, the international Miracle \r\nMission treats people with eye problems in order to \r\nrestore their vision, and Mission Robinson brings us \r\ntogether with the sister Republic of Cuba and has \r\nenabled a rapid and effective improvement in literacy \r\nrates in many countries of the Western hemisphere. The \r\nBolivarian Alternative for the Americas is an \r\nunprecedented effort to bring about integration on a \r\ndifferent basis than that of the exclusionary model of \r\nfree trade. The Alternative has proved that it is possible \r\nto establish relations between peoples based on \r\ncompletely different philosophical principles and \r\naimed at the eradication of poverty.  \r\n Finally, as regards the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the follow-up to and implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus (A/62/217), we would have \r\npreferred a text with an exclusive focus on analysing \r\nthe progress achieved. We would also have liked to see \r\nthe report reflect the problems faced by developing \r\ncountries, which were clearly described by heads of \r\nState or Government in the recent general debate held \r\nin the Assembly. Throughout the report, the focus \r\nshould be on undertaking strategies for financing for \r\ndevelopment primarily in order to reduce the most \r\nextreme inequalities between countries and to level out \r\nfinancing opportunities, improving efficiency as well \r\nas equity. In that way, we would hope to obtain the \r\nresources necessary for us to carry out our national \r\ndevelopment plans, the central policy of which has \r\nbeen to improve access to education and health and \r\nheighten the productivity of poor people, thereby \r\nsignificantly improving their quality of life. Those \r\nefforts are indispensable for achieving social justice \r\nand economic development.  \r\n Other actions that obstruct efforts to genuinely \r\nreduce inequalities are undermining the fulfilment of \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus commitments. Those actions \r\nclaim to go beyond the Monterrey Consensus, but they \r\ndistort follow-up efforts and disrupt the disbursement \r\nof financing for development. Those actions treat the \r\nissue of development with too much relativism and \r\nimpose too many policy recommendations. These are \r\nall subjects that we hope will not emerge once again at \r\nthe Follow-up International Conference to be held in \r\nQatar next year. We look forward to that Conference, \r\nand we hope it will be an opportunity to demonstrate \r\nthe political will necessary to respond to the \r\ndevelopment demands of our peoples. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Collin Beck, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Solomon Islands. \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands): I would like to \r\nthank the President of the Assembly for convening this \r\nhigh-level meeting. We certainly recognize the vital \r\nrole this gathering is playing as we work towards \r\nDoha. \r\n My delegation would like, first of all, to associate \r\nitself with the statements presented by the State \r\nMinister for Economic Affairs of Pakistan on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China and by the Honourable \r\n A/62/PV.34\r\n \r\n33 07-56108 \r\n \r\nFinance Advisor of Bangladesh on behalf of the least \r\ndeveloped countries.  \r\n In contributing to the debate, my delegation \r\nwould like to focus on aid effectiveness, reform of the \r\nBretton Woods institutions, debt, trade and the United \r\nNations system-wide focus on development as we \r\ngalvanize our efforts towards poverty eradication, \r\nsustainable economic growth and global prosperity for \r\nall. \r\n On the issue of aid effectiveness, my delegation \r\nagrees with other delegations that there must be some \r\nimprovement on enhancing ownership and \r\ncoordination and harmonizing donor funds with the \r\ndevelopment needs of developing countries. This is \r\nsaid against the background of a continued emphasis \r\non non-productive sectors, such as governance. In \r\nmany instances, that is narrowly defined as pertaining \r\nto the formal sector, without much attention given to \r\nthe informal or rural sector.  \r\n My delegation also agrees with the annual report \r\nof the Secretary-General (A/62/1), in which he stated \r\nthat too much aid is being project-driven, thus making \r\nfunds not only unpredictable but externally driven. A \r\nhuge amount of those funds is taken up by technical \r\nassistance and travel, leaving less to be devoted to \r\ncountry investment. \r\n On the issue of the Bretton Woods institutions, \r\nSolomon Islands registers its support for the call for \r\nthose institutions to undergo reform and become more \r\nrepresentative of their membership. In the case of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, 94 per cent of the \r\nworld’s population accounts for only 40 per cent of the \r\nvotes. With a view to the five-year review of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, the time is right to adopt a more \r\nrepresentative, democratic and participatory process \r\nfor the Fund’s decision mechanism. Solomon Islands \r\nalso would like to subscribe to the idea of advocating \r\nfor a closer institutionalized dialogue relationship \r\namong the Economic and Social Council, the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization \r\n(WTO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development.  \r\n I turn now to the issue of external debt. In \r\nexamining innovative ways of addressing this issue, \r\nmy delegation would like to lend its support to the \r\ninitiative of the Philippines to convert debt into equity \r\nfinancing for Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nprojects. The debt stock of Solomon Islands is five \r\ntimes the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). \r\nDebt servicing alone accounts for more than one third \r\nof our GDP, or 38 per cent of gross national product \r\n(GNP). Our total external debt is about $150 million, \r\nan amount that has placed a financial stress and burden \r\non the country’s economy and on its ability to invest in \r\nthe development sector. My delegation notes that with \r\ninternational support something could be done to \r\nrelieve the debts of all least developed countries \r\n(LDCs). We hope that this could be among the \r\noutcomes of the Doha Conference. It is pleasing to \r\nhear what the Group of Eight (G-8) has been done on \r\ndebt cancelling for selected countries. We hope that \r\nmore widespread attention could reach to the most \r\nvulnerable Members of the United Nations.  \r\n On the issue of trade, my delegation hopes that \r\nthe Doha Round of trade negotiations can be completed \r\nwith action-oriented outcomes in market access, \r\nincluding a rule-based system with policy space and \r\nassistance for developing countries with developing \r\nmarkets to make the necessary adjustments.  \r\n In undertaking all of the aforementioned, special \r\nattention must be given to the most vulnerable \r\nmembers of this Assembly — the least developed \r\ncountries and the small island developing States — \r\ngiven their structural constraints and their specific \r\nadministrative and institutional shortcomings. The least \r\ndeveloped countries in particular account only for 2 per \r\ncent of global trade, and will need duty-free and quota-\r\nfree access for all products to assist them in fully \r\nintegrating themselves into the global market. As this \r\nhigh-level meeting will note from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/62/190), least developed countries’ \r\nproducts continue to be subjected to some form of tax \r\nby some countries.  \r\n On the United Nations system-wide focus on \r\ndevelopment, my delegation is concerned that there is a \r\nslow and uneven distribution of the financial resources \r\nallocated to development. More resources seem to be \r\ncommitted to peace and security and fewer to \r\ndevelopment. My delegation hopes that we can work \r\ntowards finding a balance.  \r\n In this connection, my delegation wishes to \r\npropose that the Secretary-General undertake an \r\nanalysis of the resources needed to assist both the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Department of \r\nEconomic and Social Affairs in strengthening their \r\nmandates in preparation for the next year’s Doha \r\nA/62/PV.34  \r\n \r\n07-56108 34 \r\n \r\nmeeting on financing for development. Special \r\nattention must be given to the both the Small Island \r\nDeveloping States Unit and the High Representative’s \r\nOffice.  \r\n My delegation is aware that there are so much \r\ngoodwill and so many mechanisms out there. However, \r\nthe stringent process and conditions that have been \r\nplaced on the funding mechanisms have made it almost \r\nimpossible for small island developing States and least \r\ndeveloped countries to tap into them. We hope for \r\ngreater simplification of the process, reduction in \r\ntransaction costs, faster turnaround time for proposals \r\nand finally, and more important, complete rather than \r\npartial funding disbursal.  \r\n Given the importance of climate change, my \r\ndelegation would like to see more being done in the \r\nforestry sector to relieve the economic pressure from  \r\n \r\ncommercial logging, through conservation of forests \r\nthrough a carbon credits facility.  \r\n I would like to close by once again thanking \r\neveryone for their patience; it has been a long day. I \r\nreiterate my delegation’s commitment to the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and assure the President of our support. \r\n The Acting President: Before adjourning the \r\nmeeting, I wish to inform members that since the list of \r\nspeakers for the High-Level Dialogue is not exhausted, \r\nthe Dialogue will continue and, hopefully, conclude \r\ntomorrow morning. \r\n I thank members very much for their cooperation, \r\nand would like to thank very, very warmly the \r\ninterpreters, the technicians and the conference officers \r\nfor their understanding and their cooperation.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.35 p.m. \r\n"
