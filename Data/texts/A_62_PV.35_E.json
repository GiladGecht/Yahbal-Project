(The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 53 (continued) \r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment \r\n \r\n (b) High-level dialogue for the implementation of \r\nthe outcome of the International Conference \r\non Financing for Development \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/62/190 and \r\nA/62/217) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/271) \r\n \r\n Summary by the President of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council (A/62/76 and A/62/76/Corr.1) \r\n The President: I give the floor to Her Excellency \r\nMs. Byrganym Aitimova, chairperson of the delegation \r\nof Kazakhstan. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): I will try to be \r\nbrief today because I know that we are so tired from \r\ntrying to finalize our discussions yesterday. \r\n Economic and social development is an issue that \r\nconcerns humankind as a whole. Globalization is a \r\ncontemporary phenomenon that, on the one hand, \r\nspeeds up economic processes, offering opportunities \r\nfor the economic and social development of all \r\ncountries while, on the other, it highlights ever more \r\nstrongly the divide between the rich and poor \r\ncountries. That divide, if ignored or treated with \r\nindifference, may become an obstacle and a threat to \r\nthe world’s peace and stability. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus outlined the \r\ncomprehensive national and international policy \r\nactions required to achieve the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals. It recognized that enhanced \r\nfinancial flows are critical to the realization of those \r\ndevelopment goals. \r\n Kazakhstan fully agrees that nationally \r\nformulated and owned development strategies, \r\nadequate policy space, greater overall coherence and \r\ncoordination, including donor-recipient coordination, \r\nemployment creation and greater support for  \r\nprivate-sector growth are all critical elements in \r\nattaining the agreed development goals. In that context, \r\ngood governance, particularly enhancing transparency \r\nand combating corruption, also plays an important role. \r\n We are convinced that strengthening international \r\ntrade is also an important factor in the financing of \r\ndevelopment. The creation of a liberal multilateral \r\ntrade system will considerably stimulate development \r\nand produce certain benefits that are available to all \r\ncountries. \r\n Kazakhstan is committed to its obligations to \r\nreach the Millennium Development Goals and is \r\ntirelessly implementing a long-term development \r\nstrategy known as “Kazakhstan-2030”. Kazakhstan’s \r\nmain objective in the area of economic policy is to \r\nensure that our country joins the ranks of the most \r\ncompetitive economies. To that end, we are \r\nimplementing innovative industrial programmes to \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 2 \r\n \r\ndiversify the economy, increase the production of \r\nvalue-added goods and services, and lay the foundation \r\nfor a high-technology service economy. \r\n Kazakhstan has significantly improved its \r\nmacroeconomic and fiscal management. In our country, \r\nan economic financial environment has been created \r\nthat corresponds to the standards of a developed \r\nmarket. Moreover, in recent years the Republic of \r\nKazakhstan has been making considerable investments \r\nin the economies of other developing countries through \r\nbilateral and multilateral channels. Joining the World \r\nTrade Organization will help Kazakhstan in that \r\nendeavour. We deem it important that this should take \r\nplace on equitable and non-discriminatory terms. \r\n As a continental country, Kazakhstan strongly \r\nbelieves that it is important to take into account the \r\ninterests of landlocked developing countries in the \r\ndevelopment of transit transport capabilities, the \r\npromotion of trade, and obtaining access to world \r\nmarkets. This year has significant importance for the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action. Now is the time to \r\nreview the progress achieved in the implementation of \r\nthe Programme. \r\n Kazakhstan hopes that the success of this meeting \r\nwill help to enable the achievement of the \r\ndevelopment-related objectives set out in the \r\nMillennium Declaration and contribute to the good \r\npreparation of the Doha Conference at the end of 2008. \r\n In order to provide for the further implementation \r\nof the long-term commitments of the Monterrey \r\nConference, there is a need to improve cooperation \r\nbetween Governments, international organizations, the \r\nprivate sector and the non-governmental organization \r\nsector within the framework of the agreed agenda for \r\nthe Conference. In that context, the United Nations \r\nsystem and especially the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil have a very important role to play, not least in \r\nthe monitoring and coordination of the implementation \r\nprocess. \r\n The President: I thank the representatives of \r\nAlbania, Suriname and Tajikistan and the observer of \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union for having graciously \r\naccepted not to take the floor this morning. I ask the \r\nSecretariat to distribute their statements at this \r\nmeeting. \r\n I now call on His Excellency Mr. Raymond \r\nWolfe, chairman of the delegation of Jamaica. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): Let me at the outset \r\nindicate that Jamaica wishes to align itself with the \r\nstatement made by Pakistan on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n The reports of the Secretary-General before us \r\nspeak to the overall improvement in the performance of \r\ndeveloping countries and the mixed results in terms of \r\nthe progress in implementing the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. It is therefore important that as we read the \r\nreports, we bear in mind the diverse needs of \r\ndeveloping countries and their extreme vulnerability to \r\nglobal economic and financial instability, rising \r\ncommodity prices and natural disasters.  \r\n In looking at the overall framework, we take the \r\nview that the starting point for our deliberations should \r\nbe an acknowledgement that efforts at the domestic and \r\nglobal levels are mutually reinforcing. A broad \r\nframework of reference that encapsulates the rule of \r\nlaw, sound economic policies and effective, \r\nparticipatory democratic institutions includes \r\nobjectives that are not confined to the activity at the \r\ncountry level. They permeate action at the global level \r\nand are central to the effective functioning of the \r\nglobal economy. We therefore expect that due regard \r\nwill be given to the dynamic nature of this relationship \r\nduring the course of our discussions, especially \r\nregarding the voice and effective participation of \r\ndeveloping countries in global economic governance. \r\n Commenting on national efforts, Jamaica accepts \r\nthat each country has the primary responsibility for its \r\nown development. Jamaica remains fully committed to \r\nthat objective. The Government also continues to pay \r\nspecial attention to the promotion of trade and \r\ninvestment as engines for growth and development in \r\nthe context of job creation, poverty eradication and the \r\noverall improvement in the standard of living of our \r\npeople.  \r\n We therefore see merit in the recommendations \r\nadvanced in the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/62/217) related to mobilizing domestic financial \r\nresources for development to provide developing \r\ncountries with the enabling environment to attract \r\nprivate investment. We also concur that the necessary \r\nregulatory framework has to be put in place, and we \r\nare convinced of the strong role that national \r\ndevelopment banks can play in the process, particularly \r\nin providing financing for small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises. With respect to the latter, and in keeping \r\n A/62/PV.35\r\n \r\n3 07-56373 \r\n \r\nwith our own experiences, we wish to underscore the \r\nurgent need for technical assistance and innovative \r\npublic and private partnerships to strengthen access by \r\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises to financing. \r\n The Government is also working with the \r\nJamaican Diaspora to see how best we can build \r\npartnerships and support initiatives aimed at enhancing \r\nthe welfare of local communities. We see this as \r\nimportant since it is not limited to a rather skewed \r\nfocus on remittances, but encapsulates a much broader \r\napproach for the overall development of the country. \r\n At the same time, our efforts can be successful \r\nonly in a global economic environment conducive to \r\ngrowth and with the requisite support of developed \r\npartners. Such an approach is necessary if long-term \r\ndevelopment objectives, plans and strategies are to  \r\nbe realized. This is essential for countries like  \r\nJamaica that, notwithstanding our classification as a  \r\nmiddle-income developing country, are especially \r\nsusceptible to natural disasters, are highly indebted, \r\nhave limited access to global capital markets and have \r\nlimited resources, productive and export diversification \r\ncapacities. \r\n Against this background, we welcome the call \r\nmade in the Secretary-General’s report (A/62/217) for \r\nforeign direct investment (FDI) flows to be broadened \r\nto a wider range of countries, including least developed \r\ncountries, landlocked developing countries and small \r\nisland developing States. We further wish to reiterate \r\nthat FDI flows should respond more commensurately \r\nwith the reform efforts being undertaken in developing \r\ncountries. We see merit in the recommendation of the \r\nSecretary-General that multilateral financial \r\ninstitutions should adapt the range of products and \r\nservices they provide to meet the evolving needs of \r\nboth low and middle-income countries. \r\n There is also a need for predictable and stable \r\nflows of official development assistance (ODA), given \r\nthat ODA continues to remain crucial for financing the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We believe that \r\nthe discussions in the context of the Development \r\nCooperation Forum of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil can enhance progress in this regard. \r\n With respect to debt, we wish to underscore the \r\nneed for a renewed and vigorous approach to resolving \r\nthe external debt problem of developing countries, \r\nincluding middle-income developing countries.  \r\n On the issue of trade, I wish to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s expectation that development will remain \r\nat the core of the Doha trade negotiations and that due \r\nregard will be given to the principles of special and \r\ndifferential treatment. \r\n Finally, we remain firmly convinced of the \r\ncrucial role that the United Nations can play in \r\nadvancing the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. We see this responsibility evolving through \r\ngreater collaboration and cooperation with the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions as well as with the World Trade \r\nOrganization, especially through the annual spring \r\nmeeting of the Economic and Social Council with these \r\norganizations as well as the United Nations Conference \r\non Trade and Development.  \r\n We also recognize and accept that more has to be \r\ndone to strengthen the implementation of the \r\nConsensus and that the now strengthened Economic \r\nand Social Council, through the Development \r\nCooperation Forum, is better poised to fulfil this \r\nresponsibility. For this reason, Jamaica wishes to \r\nreiterate that our deliberations on how best to \r\nstrengthen the review process should bear in mind the \r\nmany existing forums that have been established for \r\nthis purpose, in order to avoid any unintended \r\nduplication of efforts and mechanisms. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ahmed Mekki Ahmed, chairman of the delegation \r\nof Sudan. \r\n Mr. Ahmed (Sudan): On behalf of my delegation, \r\nI would like to congratulate you for convening this \r\ntimely High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. We are confident that under your \r\ndiligent and able leadership our deliberations will be \r\nsteered to fruitful conclusions. \r\n My delegation aligns its statement with that of \r\nthe representative of Pakistan, speaking on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, and the statement of the \r\nrepresentative of Benin on behalf of the African Group, \r\nas well as the statement of Bangladesh on behalf of the \r\nleast developed countries. \r\n I would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive reports on the \r\nissue at hand. My delegation attaches special \r\nimportance to this meeting and recognizes its vital role \r\nin paving the way to the follow up of the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to Review \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 4 \r\n \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be \r\nheld in 2008 in Doha. \r\n We are hopeful that the Conference, which will \r\ntake stock of what has been achieved five years after \r\nthe adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, will also \r\naddress the best means to strengthen its \r\nimplementation as we move ahead within a fluid global \r\nenvironment that carries both opportunities and \r\nchallenges. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus is predicated on the \r\nprinciple of partnership and a set of commitments to be \r\ncarried out by both the developing countries and \r\ndeveloped countries. The Secretary-General, in his \r\nanalytical assessment, states that the picture is quite \r\nmixed and points to considerable advances in some \r\nareas and to modest progress, stagnation or \r\nretrogression in others. \r\n We recall that, in 2002, members of the \r\nDevelopment Assistance Committee made various \r\npromises before and at the Monterrey International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to increase \r\ntheir aid by 2006 from the previous levels set in 2000. \r\nWhile some managed to do so, others failed to fulfil \r\ntheir promises, and total official development \r\nassistance (ODA) fell by 5.1 per cent to around \r\n$103.9 billion in 2006, which is 0.3 per cent of gross \r\nnational income, way below the internationally agreed \r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income in ODA. \r\n Donors’ promises to double aid to Africa, a \r\ncontinent that is off track in meeting the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), remain unfulfilled. \r\nDespite the fact that preliminary data shows that \r\nbilateral net ODA to Africa rose by 23 per cent, most \r\nof the increase was due to debt relief grants for one or \r\ntwo countries, and in fact ODA is expected to further \r\ndecline in 2007. \r\n In my own country, the Sudan, ODA has been \r\ndeclining since the early 1990s. Over the period  \r\n1989-1995, ODA to the Sudan averaged about \r\n$22.2 per capita, while in 1982 it was $31. In 1990 it \r\nwas $29 and has diminished since then due to the \r\nunfair unilateral sanctions imposed on the Sudan since \r\nthe early 1990s. We also note that, while humanitarian \r\naid to the Sudan increased per capita, ODA declined \r\nsharply over that period. The declining ODA is a major \r\nissue that needs to be underscored, as it constitutes a \r\nvital commitment on the part of the developed \r\ncountries to assist the developing countries if the \r\nMDGs are ever to be achieved by 2015. \r\n Despite serious challenges and constraints, the \r\nSudan has continued to implement macroeconomic and \r\nmicroeconomic reform policy packages that have \r\nlowered inflation from the 130 per cent level of the \r\n1990s to a single-digit figure since the year 2000. \r\nGreater attention is being devoted to the most \r\nvulnerable portion of the population so as to improve \r\nthe quality of life of the poor. The Sudan has \r\nestablished a community development fund in order to \r\nfacilitate easy access by the poor to microcredit loans \r\nto enable them to produce their food and virtually \r\ngenerate income. \r\n A project aimed at the expansion of the \r\nmicrofinance sector in the Sudan, commissioned by the \r\ncountry’s central bank, has been established in \r\nrecognition of the important role that vibrant \r\nmicrofinance can play in mobilizing resources for the \r\neconomic development of the country, particularly in \r\nterms of poverty eradication. The main aim of the \r\nstrategy is to facilitate access to financial services by \r\nthe poor in rural, semi-urban and urban areas by \r\nexpanding and developing the microfinance sector in a \r\ncost-effective, gender-sensitive and sustainable \r\nmanner. \r\n As a result of favourable amendments to the \r\ncountry’s Investment Act, and as an outcome of the \r\npeace agreements, an atmosphere conducive to \r\ninvestment has been created, and a considerable level \r\nof foreign direct investment is being attracted to many \r\nsectors, especially agriculture, animal resources, \r\nenergy and light industries.  \r\n It must be pointed out that all of those efforts are \r\nbeing impeded by the country’s huge external debt, \r\nwhich stands at more than $27 billion, of which more \r\nthan 50 per cent constitutes accumulated arrears. The \r\nSudan’s external debt problem continues to limit the \r\ncountry’s access to external development financing. \r\nThe Government is concerned that, after seven years of \r\nsuccessful implementation of successive staff-\r\nmonitored programmes, it is not benefiting from any \r\ndebt-relief initiatives.  \r\n On international trade, it is necessary to develop \r\na strong global partnership for development in order to \r\nguarantee an open, rule-based, predictable and  \r\nnon-discriminatory trading and financial system. The \r\nspecial need of the least developed countries for  \r\n A/62/PV.35\r\n \r\n5 07-56373 \r\n \r\nduty-free and quota-free unhindered market access for \r\nall their products must be addressed. \r\n On South-South cooperation, the Sudan strongly \r\nbelieves in the value of utilizing complementarity and \r\ngeographical proximity in the face of rapid \r\nglobalization, the benefits of which have not been \r\nequally shared, in order to forge strong and expanding \r\neconomic relations between countries in Africa, Asia \r\nand Latin America. \r\n Within the framework of strengthening  \r\nSouth-South cooperation for enhancing economic \r\npartnerships and in the context of the Cotonou \r\nAgreement, the Sudan in December 2006 hosted the \r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific group summit to \r\naccelerate the process of finalizing the negotiations on \r\neconomic partnership agreements as quickly as \r\npossible, and will pursue that effort throughout the \r\nterm of its presidency up to December 2008. \r\n In conclusion, while the Monterrey Consensus \r\nhighlighted the role of internal conditions for \r\nmobilizing resources, the role of international \r\nassistance remains a key factor, and we look forward to \r\nfurther addressing those issues and to crafting our way \r\nforward in Doha next year. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Paul Badji, chairman of the delegation of Senegal. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): My \r\nstatement was to have been made two days ago by \r\nMr. Cheikh Tidiane Gadio, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Senegal, who had other duties to attend to and was \r\ncompelled to leave New York. He asked me to make \r\nthis statement on his behalf. I shall deliver an abridged \r\nversion. \r\n   “I wish to share some notes I made in \r\nreviewing the high-quality reports submitted to us \r\nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in documents \r\nA/62/190 and A/62/217. My notes address the \r\nprincipal sources of financing for development: \r\nforeign direct investment, trade, official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and debt. \r\n   “The reports tell us that, for all developing \r\ncountries, foreign direct investment increased \r\nfrom 18 per cent to 48 per cent of total financial \r\noutlay between 1970 and 2006. However, such \r\ninvestments are strongly concentrated in some \r\nregions and there is a great disparity between \r\ncountries in the same region. That is particularly \r\ntrue for sub-Saharan Africa. \r\n   “Turning to international trade, the reports \r\nstress that developing countries remain seriously \r\nhampered in gaining access to the markets of the \r\ndeveloped countries and that commitments to \r\nservices liberalization under the General \r\nAgreement on Trade in Services are of limited \r\nscope. \r\n   “With respect to ODA, the situation is \r\nhardly any better. According to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, despite an increase from $27 billion to \r\n$73 billion on average between 1980 and 2005, \r\nwe are still far from achieving the goal of \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income. He goes on \r\nto say that, according to initial estimates, ODA \r\nflows have slightly dropped in 2006 and that they \r\nwill stop practically increasing in 2007, according \r\nto projections. In the same vein, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral indicates that, foreign debt relief has \r\nonly had a limited effect because, for the most \r\npart, it has been applied to debt stocks that in any \r\ncase would have been difficult, if not impossible, \r\nto pay back, in addition to the fact that debt relief \r\nmeasures, however salutary they may be, are not \r\nenough to ensure the viability of the debt stock.  \r\n   “These are the rather eloquent reasons for \r\nthe limits on the four main sources of financing \r\nfor development, and they are the reason for the \r\npoor results that we have seen since 2002. The \r\npromises of Monterrey will be fulfilled only if, in \r\naddition to acting on those commitments, we \r\nstrive to find instruments to mobilize additional \r\nresources — instruments which would \r\nsupplement the four main sources that I have just \r\nmentioned.  \r\n   “The Leading Group on Solidarity Levies to \r\nFund Development has been involved in this \r\nexercise since it was set up in 2006. This Group, \r\nwhich now includes 54 member countries, has set \r\nas its main goal to identify, test on a pilot basis \r\nand disseminate innovative projects to finance \r\ndevelopment. Among the potential new \r\nmechanisms identified by the Group, we might \r\nrefer, among others, to the International Drug \r\nPurchase Facility as well as the air-ticket \r\nsolidarity levy and the Global Digital Solidarity \r\nFund.  \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 6 \r\n \r\n   “I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nrecall that the Digital Solidarity Fund, an \r\ninitiative of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment is recognized as a special way to \r\ncombat poverty and was endorsed by the \r\ncommunity of nations during the World Summit \r\non the Information Society. It proposed a “one \r\nper cent of digital solidarity…” initiative known \r\nas the Geneva Principle, the implementation of \r\nwhich seems to us crucial if we want to reduce \r\nthe digital divide in developing countries, \r\nespecially in Africa.  \r\n   “This Principle consists of proposing to any \r\ncompany that awards public contracts to pay one \r\nper cent of the amount of the contract to the \r\nDigital Solidarity Fund as a contribution to deal \r\nwith the digital divide. National administrations \r\nand local communities could also apply the \r\nGeneva Principle. Its flexibility of \r\nimplementation and voluntary nature strongly \r\nadvocate in favour of its dissemination. \r\n   “The Head of State of Senegal, Mr. \r\nAbdoulaye Wade, initiator of the Digital \r\nSolidarity Fund and of the Geneva Principle, has \r\nalso proposed a formula to mitigate the terrible \r\nshocks that our fragile economies suffer because \r\nof the huge surge in oil prices that we have seen \r\nsince 2003. By making it possible to identify the \r\nprofits made by the oil companies operating in \r\nAfrica because of the staggering increase in the \r\nprice of crude oil as well as the surcharge \r\nimposed on African countries that import the \r\nblack gold, this formula, better known as the \r\nWade Formula is proof of the duty of solidarity of \r\nthose companies towards those countries. \r\n   “Today, five years after Monterrey, \r\neconomic and social well-being is still an elusive \r\ngoal towards which many member countries of \r\nour Organization continue to strive. Indeed,  \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals appear \r\nincreasingly unattainable, particularly in Africa, \r\nand poverty is gaining ground, thus increasing the \r\ngap between nations. Accordingly, no initiative at \r\nthis crucial stage should be disregarded if we \r\nwant to continue hoping for the successful \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus.  \r\n   “It is for this reason that the countries of the \r\nLeading Group on Solidarity Levies to Fund \r\nDevelopment, which include Senegal, solemnly \r\ncall upon all States Members of our Organization \r\nto consider implementing innovative mechanisms \r\nto finance development that they have identified \r\nand started to implement.” \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Zachary Muburi-Muita, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Kenya. \r\n Mr. Muburi-Muita (Kenya): Mr. President, I \r\nexpress my appreciation to you for organizing this \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. \r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of Pakistan and Benin \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and the Group \r\nof African States, respectively. In the spirit of your \r\naddress to this meeting yesterday, I will present a \r\nhighly condensed version of my statement, the full text \r\nof which has already been submitted to the Secretariat \r\nfor circulation. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus provides a conceptual \r\nframework incidental to efforts aimed at dealing with \r\nissues of financing for development at all levels in a \r\ncomprehensive and systematic manner. My delegation \r\ntherefore calls on the international community, \r\nparticularly the developed countries, to meet their \r\ncommitments in order to keep the spirit of Monterrey \r\nalive.  For Kenya and many developing countries, \r\na number of wide-ranging reforms have been instituted \r\nsince the Monterrey Conference as part of our \r\ncommitments.  \r\n However, Kenya’s capacity to raise resources \r\ndomestically for development remains constrained, \r\nhence the need for development partners to move fast \r\nto meet their commitments in providing adequate \r\nsupport for development. \r\n Countries, have been on a steady decline since \r\nthe 1990s, particularly in Africa. There is a need to \r\ninstitute measures to reverse this negative and \r\nworrying trend. It has been established that fair trade is \r\na vital tool and development catalyst for both \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. We call for a fair, \r\nglobal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory and \r\nequitable multilateral trading system that can stimulate \r\ndevelopment worldwide. \r\n External debt is a key impediment to \r\ndevelopment in developing countries. A number of \r\ninitiatives that have been formed — for instance, the \r\n A/62/PV.35\r\n \r\n7 07-56373 \r\n \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative — have not \r\nbenefited us owing to the perception that Kenya’s debt \r\nis sustainable. This is not realistic. The international \r\ncommunity should put in place mechanisms within the \r\nfinancing for development framework that will \r\nexpedite the process of securing unconditional debt \r\nrelief for developing countries.  \r\n The Bretton Woods institutions have a particular \r\nand historically significant role in providing resources \r\nto finance development in needy countries. For a long \r\ntime, developing countries have continued to call for \r\nthe reform of the International Monetary Fund and the \r\nWorld Bank in order to make them responsive to their \r\nneeds with little or no success. It will be appreciated if \r\nour collective call can be heard and acted upon.  \r\n Finally, my delegation looks forward to a \r\nsuccessful forthcoming review of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus in 2008. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Camillo Gonsalves, chairman of the delegation of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines. \r\n Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines): Five and a half years ago, world leaders \r\ngathered in Monterrey and emphatically stated that  \r\n  “[o]ur goal is to eradicate poverty, achieve \r\nsustained economic growth and promote \r\nsustainable development as we advance to a fully \r\ninclusive and equitable global economic system” \r\n(A/CONF.198/11, chap. I, resolution 1, annex, \r\nchap. I, para. 1). \r\nToday, the question you have put before us, Sir, is \r\nwhether we have lived up to those noble sentiments. \r\n In an environment of uneven progress towards \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, of reduced official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and of entrenched \r\nglobal inequality, we must concede that, in spite  \r\nof some welcome bright spots, our collective  \r\npost-Monterrey progress has been inauspicious. \r\n The operative word in the phrase “financing for \r\ndevelopment” is development. The Monterrey \r\nConsensus cannot be viewed through the prism of \r\nbalance-sheet sleight of hand, where items are rotated \r\nfrom one budgetary column to another in a grand \r\ninternational shell game. We must focus on our \r\ncommitment to improving the lot of the billions of \r\npeople worldwide living in crushing and unimaginable \r\npoverty. \r\n Such a people-centred perspective recognizes that \r\nthere can be no one-size-fits-all approach to \r\ndevelopment. We must abandon the monolithic, \r\ninflexible, process-driven approaches to financing that \r\nhave doomed so many initiatives. The efficient and \r\nflexible disbursement of financing would be more \r\nbeneficial than simply increasing the amounts of \r\nfinancing available under existing modalities. In Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, for example, farmers \r\nseeking generously donated financing for agricultural \r\ndiversification have found themselves hopelessly mired \r\nin externally-imposed red tape and requirements that \r\nare impractical in the domestic context. Those farmers, \r\nwho are on the front line of the fallout from \r\nglobalization and iniquitous agricultural subsidies, find \r\nthemselves lost in the world of bureaucrats and no \r\ncloser to the promised and much-needed development \r\nassistance. \r\n Small countries like ours would benefit if donor \r\ncountries were to streamline their financing apparatus \r\nin such a way as to recognize our gains in democracy, \r\nanti-corruption and good governance and therefore \r\ntrust us to give relatively small amounts of money to a \r\nvariety of small projects without impractical \r\nbureaucratic encumbrances. \r\n Most middle-income countries and small island \r\ndeveloping States were not given a fresh development \r\nstart at Monterrey. We were left, as always, to \r\nuncomfortably serve two exacting masters: foreign \r\ncreditors, for whom debt-servicing and belt-tightening \r\nare paramount, and our domestic populations, for \r\nwhom expanded social and infrastructural investments \r\nare urgently required. \r\n Small middle-income countries are being \r\nexcluded from comprehensive debt relief in a manner \r\nthat calls into question the sincerity of the \r\ncommitments made at Monterrey. Indeed, for all but \r\nthe most heavily indebted countries, there is a vexing \r\nconundrum. Indebted countries, whose very \r\nindebtedness compromises their governance and \r\nstability, are told to clean up their domestic act as a \r\nprecondition for debt relief. Middle-income countries, \r\non the other hand, often stable and well-governed, are \r\ntold that their marginal competence in avoiding \r\neconomic disaster precludes them from debt relief. As \r\nsuch, middle-income countries, home to 41 per cent of \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 8 \r\n \r\nthe world’s poor, are condemned, like Sisyphus, to \r\npush the debt boulder endlessly uphill. \r\n If broad debt cancellation is unpalatable in the \r\nabstract, surely it is not beyond the ingenuity of this \r\nbody to fashion ways in which a debtor nation can \r\nsatisfy its obligations to creditors by reallocating its \r\ndebt-servicing dollars domestically to mutually agreed \r\ndevelopment projects.  \r\n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines again bemoans \r\nthe imposition of trade distorting barriers and \r\nsubsidies, which short-sightedly serve the gods of \r\ndomestic political expediency. Those policies are \r\ninvestments in instability, unrest and \r\nunderdevelopment and, as we have seen, solving their \r\nglobal repercussions and manifestations requires much \r\nmore than 0.7 per cent of gross national income. \r\n In that context, St. Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nechoes Horst Köhler, Managing Director of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, who stated to the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in 2003 that “[a]dvanced \r\neconomies must live up to their pledges, and the \r\nlongstanding target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic \r\nproduct remains for me a concrete test of their \r\ncredibility”. The Monterrey Consensus must be viewed \r\nholistically, and the continued failure of some nations \r\nto make tangible progress towards that modest goal \r\nbelies their commitment to the process.  \r\n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines notes that the \r\nconcept of ODA totalling 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome was first mooted in 1969. That was before the \r\nchallenges of climate change, the digital divide and the \r\nspecial development issues of the post-cold-war and \r\npost-9/11 world. By right, the question we should be \r\nasking ourselves today is whether 0.7 per cent is \r\nenough, not whether it is achievable. It is past time that \r\nthis moral benchmark is given juridical effect and \r\nautomaticity of process. \r\n Development in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nis heavily dependent on ODA, foreign investment and \r\ntechnical cooperation, and we are deeply grateful for \r\nthe bilateral assistance we continue to receive from \r\ncountries in North America, Europe, Latin America, the \r\nCaribbean and Asia. We also recognize the \r\nindispensable role of South-South cooperation in \r\nachieving the lofty goals of the Monterrey Consensus. \r\nAs such, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is grateful \r\nfor the initiatives of Cuba and the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela, despite their initial criticisms of the \r\nMonterrey process, and of the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan, despite its continued unjust exclusion from \r\nthis body. They have proven themselves to be willing \r\nand innovative partners in development and, in that \r\nregard, exemplary global citizens. \r\n One of the greatest artists of our Caribbean \r\ncivilization, the late Bob Marley, once observed that \r\n“a hungry mob is an angry mob”. The Monterrey \r\nConsensus embraces the same principle, recognizing \r\n“that peace and development are mutually reinforcing”. \r\nRecognition of that interdependence between \r\ndevelopment and peace means that enhanced \r\ndevelopment requires an enhancement of the \r\ninternational system of peace and security. \r\nAccordingly, we view the expansion and \r\ndemocratization of the Security Council as an integral \r\ncomponent of further credible global development. \r\n In closing, we recall the words of our  \r\nPrime Minister, the Honourable Ralph Gonsalves, at \r\nMonterrey in 2002, when he prayed that the \r\nConference would not devolve into “a dragon’s dance \r\nupon a decorous platform of the finest diplomatic \r\nlanguage which few are determined to embrace for \r\naction”. Put another way, talk is cheap, and the road to \r\nhellish underdevelopment is paved with good \r\nintentions. Five years after Monterrey, all countries — \r\ndeveloped and developing alike — must deliver on our \r\nwell-meaning words. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Harold Landveld, chairman of the delegation of \r\nSuriname. \r\n Mr. Landveld (Suriname): On behalf of Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Lygia Kraag-Keteldijk, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Suriname, and Ambassador  \r\nMac-Donald, I would like to express the appreciation \r\nof the Republic of Suriname to you, Sir, for organizing \r\nthis important Dialogue, which is very significant in \r\npreparing for the Follow-up International Conference \r\non Financing for Development to Review the \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus to be held \r\nin Doha, Qatar, next year. \r\n At the outset, my delegation wishes to align itself \r\nwith the statement made by the State Minister for \r\nEconomic Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and \r\nunderscores the importance of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus as a comprehensive agreement outlining the \r\n A/62/PV.35\r\n \r\n9 07-56373 \r\n \r\nnational and international policies required to achieve \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals. \r\n We strongly believe that the United Nations is the \r\nprincipal forum for discussing this important matter, \r\nfinding ways to resolve global economic development \r\nissues, and improving the standards of living of \r\nmillions of the world’s poorest people. Although the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on follow-up of the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment mentions some improvements, it also \r\ncalls our attention to unresolved issues. Those include \r\nunequal distribution of wealth, nationally and \r\ninternationally, as evidenced by the fact that \r\n70 per cent of the flow of private resources to \r\ndeveloping countries is being absorbed by a dozen \r\ncountries; increasing poverty worldwide; emerging \r\nnew forms of protectionism and lack of decisive \r\nprogress in the Doha trade negotiations; declining \r\ncurrent and projected levels of official development \r\nassistance, which fall far short of targets to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) worldwide; \r\nand the total debt of developing countries increasing at \r\na significant pace.  \r\n While debt relief can influence the development \r\nprocess positively, at the same time the vulnerability of \r\nmiddle-income countries is increasing due to a major \r\nshift from official to private debt. There are incomplete \r\nefforts to restructure the international financial \r\narchitecture in response to profound changes in the \r\nglobal economy.  \r\n The Government of Suriname remains committed \r\nto realizing by 2015 the targets set forth in the \r\nMillennium Declaration, which form the guiding \r\nprinciples for our development policies and \r\nprogrammes.  \r\n Suriname has achieved an economic growth of \r\napproximately 5 per cent per year during the past five \r\nyears as a result of new investments in the mining \r\nsector, implementation of stringent macroeconomic \r\npolicies and increased cooperation with bilateral and \r\nmultilateral donors.  \r\n The economic growth of our country, as with \r\nmany other developing countries, is extremely \r\nvulnerable because of our dependency on a limited \r\nnumber of sectors. This vulnerability is compounded \r\nby the fact that Suriname is a low lying coastal \r\ncountry, and the majority of the population is \r\nconcentrated in the coastal zone where most economic \r\nactivities, including fisheries, agriculture and industrial \r\nworks, are located. It is indisputable, therefore, that \r\nsea-level rise would be catastrophic for our country \r\nand others alike.  \r\n It is therefore important to include this issue on \r\nthe 2008 Doha agenda and to find innovative ways to \r\nfinance the adaptation and mitigation of climate \r\nchange, including the transfer of technology.  \r\n Suriname acknowledges the contribution of the \r\nprivate sector and civil society to development and \r\ndevelopment financing. We are therefore proud to \r\nrecall that Suriname organized the first worldwide \r\nCivil Society Forum on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) in our capital city of Paramaribo from \r\n2 to 4 May this year. This was a successful partnership \r\neffort of the Government of Suriname, MDG Global \r\nWatch and regional United Nations Associations,  \r\ncivil society, international organizations, including \r\nUnited Nations bodies, the Organization of American \r\nStates, the Caribbean Community, the European Union \r\nand a number of countries with whom Suriname \r\nmaintains close bilateral relations.  \r\n As we look forward to next year’s Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus in Doha, we are reminded that \r\nthe development promise of the Doha Round of trade \r\nnegotiations is yet to be fulfilled. This new road to \r\nDoha offers us all a welcome opportunity to ensure that \r\nmechanisms are put in place to deliver on the pledge to \r\nplace development at the centre of the international \r\ntrade agenda. The exceptional challenges faced by \r\nsmall States must, therefore, be fully addressed in this \r\nframework by, more specifically, putting emphasis on \r\nthe special and differential treatment of the most \r\nvulnerable economies among us.  \r\n In closing, allow me to summarize a few essential \r\npoints that will help bring about speedy development \r\nfor all. First, it is time to introduce a monitoring \r\nmechanism to assess the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus in order to keep it on track. \r\nSecondly, we should continue efforts to increase aid \r\neffectiveness and explore innovative ways for \r\ndevelopment financing. Thirdly, we should strengthen \r\ninternational financial institutions as a crucial step in \r\nthe reformation of their governance, and give \r\ndeveloping countries adequate voice and \r\nrepresentation. Fourthly, we need to actively support \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 10 \r\n \r\nthe poorest countries in their efforts to integrate into \r\nthe world trade and economic systems by allowing \r\nthem to protect their markets during a transitional \r\nperiod against unfair competition that affects their \r\ndevelopment and food security. Fifthly, in Doha next \r\nyear, we are obliged to deliver substantial change in the \r\ncurrent development process by supporting innovative \r\nfinance initiatives. Finally, South-South cooperation, \r\nincluding through triangular cooperation, should be \r\nsupported under the condition that it should not be \r\ncomplimentary to North-South cooperation. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Hassan Ali Saleh, chairman of the delegation of \r\nLebanon. \r\n Mr. Saleh (Lebanon): My delegation wishes to \r\nthank you, Mr. President, for guiding the third  \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. \r\nWe are quite confident that under your able leadership \r\nwe will be able to conclude our work and make some \r\nsubstantive achievements.  \r\n My delegation wishes to align itself with the \r\nstatement made by Her Excellency Ms. Rabbani Khar, \r\nMinister for Economic Affairs of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Pakistan, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n This third High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment is quite important this year as it is \r\nintended to assess the state of implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, to define the framework and \r\nmodalities of the Follow-up International Conference \r\non Financing for Development to Review the \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be \r\nheld in Doha, Qatar, in the second half of 2008, and to \r\nprovide some substantive contribution to the \r\npreparation of the aforementioned Conference.  \r\n We are looking forward to a significant review of \r\nthe implementation of the Monterrey Consensus. In \r\nthis respect, the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/62/217) presents an image that varies in landscape \r\nfrom considerable advances in some areas of \r\nimplementation, to modest progress, stagnation or \r\nretrogression in others. This should inspire our efforts \r\ntowards a greater determination to implement the \r\nMonterrey Consensus. This image is further coloured \r\nby certain factual realities that we need to take into \r\naccount and try to address. These range from the \r\ndecrease in official development assistance (ODA) to \r\nthe lack of progress in the Doha Development Round \r\nof World Trade Organization trade negotiations.  \r\n Actions need to be taken at different levels. At \r\nthe national level, there is a need to pursue appropriate \r\nlegal and regulatory reforms to create an enabling \r\nenvironment for private economic activity. This is not \r\nto deny the developmental role of the public sector, but \r\na constructive synergy between the two could \r\nencourage growth and development.  \r\n In this respect, it is important to develop a \r\ndiversified domestic financial system that promotes \r\nfinancial services capable of facilitating the financing \r\nof productive investments, providing microcredits and \r\nmicrofinances and making access to such services \r\naffordable to all and procedurally straightforward. \r\nMacroeconomic policies need also to be geared toward \r\nemployment generation. In Lebanon, financial services \r\nare advanced, and there are special programmes \r\nearmarked for the provision of microcredits and for \r\nfacilitating the access to finance of small and medium \r\nsize enterprises.  \r\n At the international level, several issues need to \r\nbe addressed. First, the inflows of foreign direct \r\ninvestment (FDI) to the developing countries reached \r\n$400 billion in 2006. Although we are encouraged by \r\nthis figure, we note with great concern the fact that \r\n70 per cent of FDI inflows went to about 12 developing \r\ncountries, channelled mainly to the primary commodity \r\nsector, particularly oil.  \r\n South-South cooperation is becoming an \r\nincreasing source of FDI. Such cooperation should not \r\nbe considered as a substitute for North-South \r\ncooperation, but rather complementary to it. It could \r\nfurther be enhanced by triangular South-South-North \r\ncooperation, which can not only lead to an increase in \r\nthe inflow of FDI to developing countries, but also to \r\nthe diffusion of technology. The migrant community \r\ncould form another source of FDI in their countries of \r\norigin; hence the need to reduce barriers on \r\nremittances.  \r\n Secondly, the Doha Development Round \r\nrepresents an opportunity to redress the imbalances in \r\nthe multilateral trading system by providing enhanced \r\nand real market access and entry for developing \r\ncountries’ exports of manufactured goods, commodities \r\nand services. We are quite concerned by the appearance \r\nof new forms of protectionism, and we consider that \r\nthe lack of progress in the World Trade Organization’s \r\nDoha Development Round is affecting in one way or \r\nanother the growth of international trade and \r\n A/62/PV.35\r\n \r\n11 07-56373 \r\n \r\ndecreasing its capacity to become a leading engine for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Thirdly, ODA remains among the most important \r\ntools for financing the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We are concerned by the \r\ndecline in official development assistance (ODA), \r\nwhich diminished in 2006 to 0.30 per cent of the gross \r\nnational income of countries members of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment, from 0.33 per cent in 2005. We consider \r\nthat the inclusion of debt relief, technical assistance \r\nand emergency relief as ODA does not really represent \r\nadditional resources for development. It is quite \r\nobvious that there is a pressing need to increase the \r\noverall flows of ODA, net of debt relief, technical \r\nassistance and emergency relief. We call upon \r\ndeveloped countries to meet their aid commitments and \r\nto make concrete efforts to achieve the target of \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) as official \r\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries and the \r\ntarget of 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of the GNP of developed \r\ncountries as ODA to least developed countries. \r\n Fourthly, debt is still among the most important \r\nfactors that could hamper the development efforts of an \r\nindebted country, thus setting back its development \r\nagenda. The developed countries need to carry out \r\nmajor debt relief, debt restructuring and debt \r\ncancellation in order to enable developing countries to \r\nallocate to development the financial resources saved. \r\nIn that respect, we consider that the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt \r\nRelief Initiative are aimed in the right direction. We \r\ncall upon creditors and debtors to prevent or address \r\nunsustainable debt situations. We call upon developed \r\ncountries to carry out debt relief, cancellation and \r\nrestructuring for middle-income countries. \r\n Fifthly, we support the current efforts to reform \r\nthe international financial institutions. We consider that \r\nthe final outcome should result in a significant increase \r\nin the voice, participation and voting power of \r\ndeveloping countries in the governance of those \r\ninstitutions. \r\n Sixthly, there is an urgent need to find new and \r\ninnovative sources of financing for development. \r\nLebanon welcomes any initiative in that direction and \r\nconsiders that finding the appropriate financial \r\nresources would help all developing countries move \r\ncloser to achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n Finally, we would like to reaffirm once again our \r\ncontinued commitment to the dialogue on the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus and would \r\nlike to assure you, Sir of our cooperation and support. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Martin Belinga-Eboutou, chairman \r\nof the delegation of Cameroon. \r\n Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At this advanced stage of our debate, when \r\neverything has been said, well said and sometimes \r\nexcellently said, I come rather late. My delegation \r\nshares the concerns expressed, particularly regarding \r\nthe need to redouble the political will to move from \r\nwords to action — to fulfil the commitments we made \r\nat the Millennium Summit and the Monterrey \r\nConference. Thus, my delegation could have refrained \r\nfrom taking the floor. However, the importance of this \r\ndebate, which has had such high participation, suggests \r\nto us a number of comments, which my delegation \r\nwould like to share with members. We shall do so by \r\nplacing this debate in context with regard to Africa, on \r\nthe one hand, and to the very raison d’être of the \r\nUnited Nations, on the other. And, of course, we shall \r\ndo so while respecting the time limit that you \r\nproposed, Mr. President.  \r\n First, I shall discuss Africa. Last week, the \r\nGeneral Assembly considered the progress report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/62/204) on implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the 1998 report on the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa. Indeed, the \r\ndebate focused on the international community’s \r\nimplementation of the commitments undertaken to \r\nsupport Africa in its development efforts. Is it an \r\naccident of scheduling that today, the same Assembly \r\nis talking about financing for development? For our \r\npart, we wish to see it as a happy coincidence that \r\ncould be a sign of the times. We find many reasons for \r\nhope in this debate. \r\n Here, we wish once again to express our gratitude \r\nto all our development partners who have made \r\ncommitments or decisions to cancel the multilateral \r\nand bilateral debt of African countries that fulfil the \r\nrequired conditions. We also wish to thank them for the \r\nmultifaceted support provided to Africa in its difficult \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 12 \r\n \r\nand uneven progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n But much still needs to be done if we are to meet \r\nthe deadline and attain the goals set for 2015, \r\nparticularly the eradication of poverty, of ignorance \r\nand of the major pandemics. That explains and \r\nhighlights the relevance of the recommendations by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (A/62/203). Those \r\nrecommendations are directed to our partners, and we \r\nwould like to touch upon a few of them. \r\n The lack of progress in the Doha Round of \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations remains a major \r\nproblem for Africa. That is why we are waiting for a \r\nhigh level of assistance from the international \r\ncommunity. The members of the Group of Eight should \r\nurgently and substantially increase their aid to Africa if \r\nthey want to double it by 2010, as they have pledged to \r\ndo. Accordingly, they are invited to design a series of \r\ninnovative financing mechanisms to compensate for \r\nany reduction in core budget credits. It is also \r\nimportant to ensure that multilateral trade agreements, \r\nincluding the final arrangements of the Doha Round, \r\naccord priority to Africa’s needs and include \r\ndevelopment provisions tailored to needs. The Aid for \r\nTrade Initiative should help African countries to \r\nimplement various trade arrangements, including the \r\nDoha Round and economic partnership agreements, by \r\nremoving the many obstacles faced by African \r\ncountries.  \r\n Secondly, this debate harks back to the dream of \r\nthe founding fathers of our Organization — a dream \r\nthat was solemnly reaffirmed at the Millennium \r\nSummit: to build a world that is peaceful because it is \r\nprosperous. The preamble of the Charter is particularly \r\neloquent in that regard:  \r\n   “We the peoples of the United Nations, \r\ndetermined ... to promote social progress and \r\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom, and for \r\nthese ends ... to employ international machinery \r\nfor the promotion of the economic and social \r\nadvancement of all peoples, have resolved to \r\ncombine our efforts to accomplish these aims”. \r\n That reminder gives a very particular tone to our \r\ndebate: it is about peace, which is gravely threatened \r\ntoday by poverty and extreme poverty. The \r\ncommitments that we made at Monterrey, which are \r\nrelated to financing for development, in fact concern \r\nthe financing of peace. Thus, we must fulfil them. We \r\nhave the means to do so; we must simply demonstrate \r\nthe political will and solidarity needed.  \r\n As President Paul Biya recalled on 23 October \r\n2007,  \r\n   “Such solidarity should not be limited to the \r\nexpression of good intentions or to catalogues of \r\nresolutions or individual and collective \r\ncommitments, whose implementation is always \r\npostponed. It must be effective solidarity, \r\ntranslated into significant actions and facts \r\ncapable of responding to the needs and \r\nexpectations of countries of the South — needs \r\nthat, as we know, are enormous”.  \r\n We have no choice. The waste of resources and \r\nthe worsening of inequalities can no longer be \r\ntolerated. They are threats not only to the pace of \r\ndevelopment and the stability of institutions, but also, \r\nand above all, to the survival of all of us.  \r\n What future can there be for peace, security or \r\nprosperity in a world where 20 per cent of the \r\npopulation holds 85 per cent of all assets while the \r\nimmense majority of individuals lack the most basic \r\nnecessities? How can a world that numbers more than a \r\nbillion of illiterate people — most often exploited, \r\nliving in extreme poverty and excluded from \r\nparticipation of any kind —aspire to democracy? \r\n The twenty-first century will be one of sharing or \r\nit will simply not be. It is thus urgent — indeed vital —\r\nthat today’s States and peoples become convinced of \r\nthe necessity of sharing: sharing wealth so that we can \r\nall live decently; sharing knowledge to facilitate \r\nendogenous development. It is in full awareness that \r\nthe twenty-first century will be one of sharing that at \r\nthe Millennium Summit, the President of the Republic \r\nof Cameroon, His Excellency Paul Biya, made the case \r\nfor an ethics in relations among nations, for an ethics \r\nof globalization which would put mankind at the centre \r\nof all of our policies. \r\n This proposal, strongly reiterated at the  \r\nthirty-fourth session of the General Conference of \r\nUNESCO, calls for, and is based on, a contract of true \r\nsolidarity. Such a contract would allow us to tackle \r\nurgently the eradication of the poverty, marginalization \r\nand exclusion that seem to characterize our world. As \r\nsaid earlier, we need to help all countries to acquire the \r\nknowledge and technology they need. Those who are \r\n A/62/PV.35\r\n \r\n13 07-56373 \r\n \r\nsuffering, or those who are particularly disadvantaged, \r\ndeserve assistance from those who are privileged. That \r\nis what heads of State affirmed in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). I hope that we will never \r\nforget that. Thus imbued with this ethic of shared \r\nsolidarity, let us honour, without further delay, all the \r\ncommitments, all the promises we made in the \r\nMillennium Declaration and at the Monterrey \r\nConference. \r\n We need to invest in development and thus in \r\npeace. As the Secretary-General has said, peace is the \r\nchild of development. We know the causes of  \r\nnon-development, conflict and war; we also know the \r\ningredients of development for peace. Let us remember \r\nwhat the poet Saadi told us: “He who learns the rules \r\nof wisdom without living by them, is like the man who \r\nlabours in his fields without ever sowing the seeds”. It \r\nis never too late to sow the seeds. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency, Mr. Riyad Mansour, chairman of the \r\nobserver delegation of Palestine. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Palestine): During the debate at \r\nthe beginning of the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Sir, President Abbas conveyed to \r\nyou the congratulations of Palestine on your \r\nassumption of the high post of President of the General \r\nAssembly (see A/62/PV.10). Since this is the first time \r\nI speak before you, I too would like to convey my \r\npersonal congratulations to you and to say how \r\ndelighted I am to see you in the presidency. \r\n(spoke in Arabic)  \r\n It gives me pleasure to address the General \r\nAssembly on a question that is extremely important for \r\nall of us. We support the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China.  \r\n The region of the Middle East, together with the \r\nother countries of the world, particularly the \r\ndeveloping countries, is confronting problems and \r\nchallenges relating to development. The countries of \r\nour region know that the Millennium Development \r\nGoals adopted in 2000 are closely linked to the \r\nMonterrey Consensus process: financing for \r\ndevelopment is crucial in  freeing countries from abject \r\npoverty. Despite its geopolitical and economic \r\nimportance, the region of the Middle East continues to \r\nconfront additional challenges, such as the occupation, \r\nthat has gone on for more than 40 years and that has \r\ncontributed immensely to the instability of the region \r\nand undermined development there. Observers and \r\nexperts agree that instability is the main cause of the \r\nregion’s weak economic performance and for its lack \r\nof integration into the international economy. \r\n Palestine has an important place in that region. \r\nOver the years, it has been among the principal \r\nrecipients of international aid. Thanks to the \r\ninternational community, we have over the years \r\ncarried out numerous achievements and reforms in the \r\neconomic area because of the self-motivation of the \r\nPalestinian people. We have made major strides \r\ntowards economic and political reform, with the goal \r\nof establishing a solid, transparent and open financial \r\nsystem. The overall aim is to give our people a system \r\nof governance consonant with international systems, \r\nwhich is, an absolute right it shares with all other \r\npeoples of the world. \r\n But despite many achievements made thanks to \r\naid and support from donors, the humanitarian and \r\neconomic situation of the Palestinian people continues \r\nto be grim. Development efforts in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories are still thwarted by Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, through arbitrary measures which in \r\nrecent years have made it practically impossible to \r\nmake any economic progress, or achieve any financial \r\nstability. Through these illegal practices, which violate \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law, \r\nIsrael has, over the past seven years, destroyed most of \r\nthe infrastructure, institutions  and facilities which, \r\nthanks to the generosity of donor countries, were built \r\nin occupied Palestine following the signing of the \r\nDeclaration of Principle in 1993. The current situation \r\nis a humanitarian disaster. Instead of channelling the \r\nenergies of our people towards development and \r\nbuilding a bright future, our people are obliged, due to \r\ncontinuous Israeli military aggression and economic \r\nembargo, to depend totally on humanitarian aid.  \r\n It was reaffirmed at the Monterrey Conference, \r\nthat development is a shared responsibility of the \r\ninternational community. The world leaders agreed to \r\ntake specific steps in a number of fields to support \r\ninternational partnerships for development. The \r\nPalestinian people, who live under the yoke of \r\noccupation, attach great importance to this issue \r\nbecause it is their lifeline.  \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 14 \r\n \r\n However, the economic and financial situations \r\nhave deteriorated rapidly. Since the January 2006 \r\nlegislative elections, we have been subjugated to the \r\nmost terrible forms of punishment. As Ms. Karen \r\nKoning AbuZayd, Commissioner-General of the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East, has stated, the irony is that \r\nthere is a contradiction between the international \r\ncommitment to eliminate poverty and the imposition of \r\none of the most atrocious regimes to punish the \r\nPalestinian people. Mr. John Dugard, the Human \r\nRights Council’s Special Rapporteur on human rights \r\nin the Occupied Palestinian territories, has said that \r\nthis is the first time that an occupied people has been \r\nso treated. The punishment includes Israel’s keeping \r\nthe duty and tax revenue it collects on behalf of the \r\nPalestinians, monies that form about half the \r\nPalestinian budget. The economic and trade embargo \r\nagainst our people is being stepped up through the \r\nimposition of banking restrictions for transfers of \r\nfunds, including those that come to us in the form of \r\nassistance provided by donor countries. Those \r\nmeasures have deepened the economic and \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Palestine.  \r\n In 2006, third-quarter gross national product \r\n(GNP) fell about 8 per cent compared to the same \r\nperiod in 2005. Poverty and unemployment rates \r\ncontinue to rise and now stand at about 64 and 30 per \r\ncent respectively. Although donor countries have \r\npromised that they will resume aid and Israel has said \r\nthat it will transfer part of the tax revenue it is illegally \r\nwithholding, the humanitarian situation has not seen \r\nany tangible improvement because of the continued \r\noccupation and violations and because of Israel’s \r\nrefusal to transfer to the Palestinian Authority the taxes \r\nthat it is holding illegally.  \r\n The Monterrey Consensus indicated that trade  \r\nis an engine for development, and in many  \r\ninstances the most important foreign resource for \r\nfinancing development. But that engine for \r\ndevelopment continues to be stalled because of the \r\nstifling economic embargo imposed by Israel and the \r\nblocking of our access to markets for extended periods \r\nof time, making it impossible for trade to exist. A \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development \r\nreport states that there is little opportunity to engage in \r\ntrade in the Palestinian territories, because of external \r\nand internal restrictions imposed by Israel. All of the \r\neconomic indicators in Palestine are falling. Over the \r\npast five years, our economy has lost $8.4 billion in \r\nincome, which is equivalent to more than double the \r\nvolume of today’s economy. Palestinians are \r\nincreasingly dependent on imports from Israel. Current \r\nproduction levels are only two thirds of local \r\nproduction levels of 1998. The trade deficit thus \r\nreached some $2 billion in 2006. That does not involve \r\nonly figures: it is the reality that we live each day, and \r\nit has a direct impact on hundreds of thousands of \r\nPalestinians. This reality is a threat to our livelihood \r\nand to our lives, as well as a threat to our future and \r\nthe future of our children. \r\n Israel’s occupation and illegal practices in \r\nPalestine have halted all activity on the six areas of \r\nattention of the Monterrey Consensus, thus thwarting \r\nany possibility that we might achieve tangible \r\neconomic development. The challenge of development, \r\nas was discussed in Monterrey, is a global challenge. It \r\nincludes the achievement of the MDGs for all peoples \r\nof the world without any exception. The Palestinian \r\npeople, who have been suffering under occupation for \r\nmore than 40 years, are thus entitled to enjoy \r\ndevelopment like all the world’s other peoples, and to \r\nplay our rightful role, which has long been absent from \r\nthe world scene. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fernando Valenzuela, chairman of \r\nthe observer delegation of the European Community. \r\n Mr. Valenzuela (European Community): Earlier \r\nin the debate, the Assembly heard the statement of the \r\nPresidency of the European Union (EU). Naturally, the \r\nEuropean Commission fully aligns itself with the \r\nEU statement. \r\n I am addressing the Assembly today to elaborate \r\non and to underscore certain important aspects of the \r\nfinancing for development agenda. There are three \r\nissues I would particularly like to highlight. They are: \r\nfirst, the importance of scaling up aid; secondly, the \r\nneed to improve the effectiveness of aid, including aid \r\npredictability and aid modalities; and thirdly, the \r\nimpact of trade on development. \r\n The year 2008 will be a crucial year for \r\ndevelopment. It will test the credibility of the \r\ninternational community and our global partnership. At \r\nthe Third High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, in \r\nAccra, we will further promote aid effectiveness. At \r\nthe Follow-up International Conference in Doha we \r\nwill look into the implementation of the Monterrey \r\n A/62/PV.35\r\n \r\n15 07-56373 \r\n \r\nConsensus. And in Doha too, we expect to see further \r\nprogress in the global trade negotiations. \r\n The eradication of poverty and the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remain \r\nat the centre of the European Union’s agenda. To \r\nachieve these objectives we need more and better aid \r\nand the ability to implement it faster, as well as \r\ninstitutional and structural reforms in partner countries. \r\n Europe’s drive to further increase aid stems from \r\nthe European Consensus on Development, which \r\ndefines, at the Union level, common values, principles, \r\nobjectives and methods that facilitate poverty \r\neradication. It has triggered change in the way we \r\ndeliver our assistance and in how we cooperate at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n Following the EU’s commitment to increase \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA), for the \r\nEuropean Union, doing more means meeting the \r\nobjective of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome (GNI) to official development assistance by \r\n2015. We are on track to deliver that objective. EU aid \r\nreached a record high of €48 billion — that means \r\n$67 billion — in 2006, against the global trends of \r\nODA in 2006, and remains on the rise, even when \r\nexcluding debt relief.  \r\n We are now working towards our next EU \r\nintermediate target of 0.56 per cent of GNI for ODA by \r\n2010. If the trends continue in a similar direction, EU \r\naid will represent 70 per cent of global aid in 2010. \r\nThat is why we call upon all in the donor community to \r\nlive up to their commitments and to further increase aid \r\nto ultimately achieve the 0.7 per cent target by 2015. \r\n At country level, in our partner countries our \r\ndetermination to do more and better means much more \r\nthan simply making the necessary increases in \r\nresources, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. \r\nIncreasing resources will not bring the intended results \r\nif we do not make a profound review of the way we use \r\nthose resources. \r\n We see three ways to improve the situation. First, \r\nwe must give concrete content to the concept of \r\ncomplementarity of aid. The European Union has \r\nadopted an EU Code of Conduct on the Division of \r\nLabour in Development Policy, which aims to avoid \r\nexcessive fragmentation of aid at global, country or \r\nsector levels and to improve aid effectiveness. We hope \r\nthat bilateral donors, the World Bank and the United \r\nNations will take a strong interest in the Code of \r\nConduct. It is also important for our developing \r\ncountry partners to understand that the division of \r\nlabour among donors will particularly serve the \r\ninterests of beneficiary countries by providing better \r\nmanaged aid with lower administrative costs, better \r\ntargeted aid in the context of scaling up, and aid which \r\nis less volatile. This does not imply the lowering of aid \r\nallocations at all.  \r\n Secondly, we must review our aid modalities. An \r\never-increasing number of projects would be highly \r\ndetrimental to the benefits of the scaling up process. \r\nThe European Commission is convinced that increased \r\nuse of budget support, whenever possible, is essential. \r\nBudget support is the aid modality which is the most \r\nfavourable to ownership.  \r\n Thirdly, we need to seriously put into practice the \r\nconcept of aid predictability. Our partner countries \r\nneed stable aid and longer-term perspectives regarding \r\nfuture aid flows in order to plan MDG-related public \r\nspending better. With respect to improving the \r\npredictability of our aid, the European Commission has \r\nbeen developing an MDG contract in consultation with \r\nthe EU Member States as a longer-term, more \r\npredictable form of budget support. The MDG contract \r\ntargets well-performing countries that have \r\nsuccessfully implemented budget support and that \r\nshow a commitment to achieving and monitoring the \r\nMDGs. This form of budget support would cover six \r\nyears and provide a minimum, guaranteed level of \r\nsupport within a strong framework for monitoring \r\nperformance and results. We expect the MDG contract \r\nto account for more than half of all our general budget \r\nsupport provided to African, Caribbean and Pacific \r\ncountries from the tenth European Development Fund. \r\nWe believe that this approach will provide our partner \r\nGovernments with a higher degree of predictability and \r\nthus help them to prepare longer-term strategies and \r\nspending programmes with greater confidence, \r\nenabling them to accelerate progress towards the \r\nMDGs. \r\n But we also recognize that the effectiveness of \r\nthe MDG contract will be enhanced if it is \r\nimplemented in harmony with other budget support \r\nproviders. We therefore remain committed to ensuring \r\nthat the MDG Contract will be pursued in accordance \r\nwith in-country harmonization processes. \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 16 \r\n \r\n Trade is a powerful engine for economic growth, \r\nand in substantial part countries rely on trade to fight \r\npoverty. While trade alone cannot solve development \r\nproblems, openness to trade and support for  \r\nsupply-side capacity are important elements in any \r\ncoherent development strategy. For trade to serve as an \r\nengine for growth, a number of conditions need to be \r\nfulfilled. First, there needs to be sufficient access to \r\nexport markets. Secondly, trade policy needs to \r\nencourage competitiveness. The role of trade in \r\ndevelopment is thus something that concerns both \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. Hence, we all \r\nhave a shared interest in a successful Doha deal.  \r\n The good news is that the Doha negotiations have \r\nmade more progress than people realize. A balanced, \r\nequitable and development-oriented outcome can \r\nimprove the prospects for economic growth and \r\ndevelopment and can contribute to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Therefore, members \r\nshould take this last chance to agree on the modalities \r\nfor a Doha deal. In the light of that, it is absolutely \r\nvital for all key members to show a spirit of \r\ncompromise and constructiveness and a genuine will to \r\nreach a balanced agreement by the end of this year. \r\n The EU is doing all that it can to keep up the \r\nmomentum. For example, we have shown genuine \r\nflexibility on agricultural market access. Equally, big \r\nemerging economies should move to deliver their side \r\nof the bargain. That is why we in the EU are asking \r\nthem to bolster confidence in the negotiations by \r\nmaking clear that they are ready to engage on the basis \r\nof the negotiating texts of the Chairs of the World \r\nTrade Organization. \r\n Of course, we must ensure that the Doha Round \r\ndelivers on its development promises. The EU will \r\ncontinue to watch carefully to ensure that development \r\nissues, such as aid for trade, duty-free and quota-free \r\naccess and measures against preference erosion, are \r\nadequately taken into account. \r\n The European Commission considers the \r\nMonterrey Consensus to be a key achievement of the \r\ninternational community. In Monterrey we subscribed \r\nto important commitments on financing for \r\ndevelopment and established the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. The Consensus clearly spelled out that \r\nsuch a partnership is needed to eradicate poverty and to \r\nmake real progress in the developing countries towards \r\nthe internationally established development goals and \r\ntargets. It is evident that without this global partnership \r\nand without mutual responsibility, our efforts are not \r\nlikely to bear fruit. \r\n The European Commission and the European \r\nUnion are playing our parts in an active manner in the \r\nglobal partnership, and we are looking forward to \r\nworking together with our partners during this session \r\nof the General Assembly and in the follow-up to the \r\nMonterrey implementation review in Doha next year. \r\n The President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 57/32 of 19 November 2002, I \r\ncall on Her Excellency Mrs. Anda Filip, the Observer \r\nfor the Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Mrs. Filip (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I will be \r\nbriefly presenting the main points of an intervention \r\nprepared by Mr. François de Donnea of Belgium,  \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) rapporteur on \r\ndevelopment assistance. He was in New York for the \r\ntime allotted for the high-level debate and had to return \r\nto his capital last night.  \r\n Official development assistance (ODA) is a key \r\ncomponent of the Monterrey Consensus, and it remains \r\none of the principle concerns of the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion. It is an area where parliaments can provide very \r\ndirect input, particularly through the budgetary \r\nprocess. In order to draw attention to the many \r\nproblems besetting the management of ODA, a report \r\nwas recently introduced to the IPU Standing \r\nCommittee on Finance, Sustainable Development and \r\nTrade for a broad-based consultation with our member \r\nparliaments. That consultation will culminate in a \r\npolitical resolution on foreign aid to be adopted at the \r\n118th IPU Assembly, in Cape Town, South Africa, in \r\nApril 2008. \r\n There is broad recognition of the fact that one of \r\nmost important problems in ODA management has to \r\ndo with weak ownership at the country level — the \r\ncause of a continuing misalignment between aid \r\nallocation and countries’ priorities, and consequently of \r\npoor results on the ground. Stronger ownership of the \r\nODA process can be achieved through more \r\nsubstantive involvement by parliaments. That would \r\nalso buttress politically the case for future increases of \r\nODA, and it will become critical as ODA flows are \r\nincreasingly being channelled through general budget \r\nsupport. \r\n A/62/PV.35\r\n \r\n17 07-56373 \r\n \r\n To increase ownership of ODA at the \r\nparliamentary level at least two things are required: \r\nmore regular and in-depth scrutiny and information-\r\nsharing between the executive and the legislative \r\nbranches, but also more understanding by members of \r\nparliament of how ODA truly works. Truth be told, too \r\nmany members of parliament, especially in developing \r\ncountries, do not have the capacities to exercise that \r\nrole fully or have not yet fully grasped the technical \r\ncomplexities of the ODA machinery. That is why we \r\nurge all donor agencies to pay special attention to the \r\nneeds of parliaments in developing countries and to \r\nearmark more funds for parliamentary capacity-\r\nbuilding. \r\n I should say in this regard that developments in \r\nthe context of the recent creation of the Development \r\nCooperation Forum of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil suggest that the need to involve parliaments in \r\nimproving aid effectiveness is gaining ground. The IPU \r\nwas invited to attend the first substantive consultation \r\non the Forum, which took place in Vienna this past \r\nMay, and also participated in the official launch of the \r\nForum in July in Geneva. More important, we will be \r\nworking with the Forum secretariat to help organize the \r\nparliamentary component of a tripartite stakeholders \r\nforum, including civil society and private sector \r\nrepresentatives, in May of next year. We very much \r\nbelieve in the value of that exercise.  \r\n In the interest of time I will conclude my remarks \r\nhere. The full text has been circulated in the \r\nConference Room, and we very much hope that \r\nmembers will be able to take a look at the full text.  \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe High-level Dialogue. It is time now for my \r\nconcluding remarks. \r\n I would like to express my appreciation to all \r\ndelegations — more than 90 of them — for \r\nparticipating in our High-level Dialogue. Their active \r\ncontributions to the plenary meetings, as well as to the \r\nround tables, have greatly contributed to the success of \r\nthe meeting. The conduct of the meeting has followed \r\non from the success of the sixty-second session general \r\ndebate. I would like to state with great satisfaction that \r\nMember States have risen to the challenge of \r\nrevitalizing the Assembly by engaging in a true \r\ninteractive dialogue in the spirit of consensus and \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\n Participants have put forward a wealth of ideas, \r\nnew initiatives and recommendations that enriched the \r\npolicy debate on which we can build towards the \r\nfinancing for development conference in Doha. I am \r\nencouraged by the active participation and the \r\ncontributions of the key institutional stakeholders, \r\nintergovernmental organizations, other international \r\ndevelopment institutions, the private sector and civil \r\nsociety. The engagement of all partners is also crucial \r\non the road to Doha. I am confident that the spirit of \r\ndiscussions during our High-level Dialogue augurs \r\nwell for a successful outcome in Doha. \r\n Given the time constraints and the richness of the \r\npolicy discussion over the past few days, it would not \r\nbe appropriate for me to attempt to summarize the \r\nvarious substantive issues that have been raised. \r\nRather, I will present a summary within the coming \r\nweeks. Still, allow me to make some brief remarks on a \r\nfew key topics to highlight the rich dialogue that has \r\ntaken place. \r\n Many representatives expressed their concern \r\nabout growing economic inequalities, not only between \r\ncountries but also within countries, in the context of \r\nglobalization, particularly in the context of the current \r\ninstability in global financial markets. On the domestic \r\nfront, according to several speakers, there is a crucial \r\nneed to enhance tax revenues and create more \r\ndistributive tax systems. This would not only help to \r\nreduce disparities, but would also increase public \r\nspending on basic infrastructure and services. In the \r\nsame vein, good domestic governance, effective and \r\ntransparent regulatory mechanisms and the rule of law \r\nwere stressed as key to the financing for development \r\nagenda by many participants.  \r\n For a large number of representatives, the current \r\ntrends in foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing \r\ncountries were very encouraging. Yet, a major \r\nchallenge remained: how to promote FDI in \r\nlower-income countries or those with less stable \r\ngovernance in order to boost productive economic \r\nactivity. Many delegations stressed the critical \r\nimportance of making decisive progress in the current \r\nround of multilateral trade negotiations in order to \r\naccelerate progress on development and poverty \r\nreduction. \r\n A substantial number of participants reiterated the \r\nneed to achieve the United Nations 0.7 per cent official \r\ndevelopment assistance target and to deliver on \r\nA/62/PV.35  \r\n \r\n07-56373 18 \r\n \r\ncommitments to increase aid, including to Africa, in \r\norder to maintain the overall credibility of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and as an essential prerequisite \r\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In \r\nthis regard, many speakers supported further work to \r\ndevelop innovative sources of finance.  \r\n In the view of several participants, much had \r\nbeen done to increase debt relief. But long-term debt \r\nsustainability continued to remain a significant policy \r\nissue for a number of developing countries, particularly \r\nthe least developed countries. \r\n Many participants reiterated the need to improve \r\nthe voice and effective participation of developing \r\ncountries in international economic decision-making. \r\nFinally, participants stressed that adapting to climate \r\nchange was the emerging issue that needed to be linked \r\nto the financing for development process.  \r\n The General Assembly will shortly begin \r\nconsultations on a procedural draft resolution to set out \r\nthe modalities for the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held \r\nin Doha in 2008. After informal consultations with \r\nMember States and the major groups, I have concluded \r\nthat this process can most effectively be taken forward \r\nby the facilitators that I appointed at the beginning of \r\nthe sixty-second session: His Excellency Ambassador \r\nMaged Abdelaziz, Permanent Representative of Egypt, \r\nand His Excellency Ambassador Johan Løvald, \r\nPermanent Representative of Norway.  \r\n In the spirit of Monterrey, I would encourage all \r\nMember States to give their full support and \r\ncooperation to the facilitators as they work to conclude \r\nagreement on the draft resolution in an open, \r\ntransparent and inclusive manner, and to present it to \r\nthe Assembly by the end of the main part of this \r\nsession.  \r\n Once the modalities of the Doha Conference are \r\nagreed upon, we can move to substantive discussions \r\non the six chapters of the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nother important matters in the early new year.  \r\n I declare the High-level Dialogue on Financing \r\nfor Development closed. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded the \r\nHigh-Level Dialogue on Financing for Development \r\nand this stage of its consideration of sub-item (b) of \r\nagenda item 53.  \r\n \r\nOrganization of work \r\n The President: I would like to make an \r\nannouncement concerning agenda item 71: \r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance, and agenda \r\nitem 72: Assistance to survivors of 1994 genocide in \r\nRwanda, particularly orphans, widows and victims of \r\nsexual violence.  \r\n I have requested His Excellency Mr. Jean-Marc \r\nHoscheit, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, to \r\nbe the coordinator of the informal consultations on the \r\ndraft resolutions under agenda items 71 and 72, and he \r\nhas graciously accepted.  \r\n May I request those delegations intending to \r\nsubmit draft resolutions under agenda items 71 and 72 \r\nto do so as early as possible in order to allow time, if \r\nneed be, for negotiations with a view to reaching \r\nconsensus on the draft resolutions. Representatives are \r\nrequested to consult the Journal for the announcement \r\nof the time, date and venue for the first meeting of the \r\ninformal consultations on these two agenda items.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 11.45 a.m. \r\n"
