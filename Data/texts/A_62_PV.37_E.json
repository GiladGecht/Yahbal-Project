(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Beck (Palau), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 87 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency  \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/258) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.5**) \r\n \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): Let me start by \r\nthanking Director General ElBaradei for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  \r\n Iceland is among the States sponsoring the draft \r\nresolution on the report of the IAEA. \r\n The IAEA celebrated its fiftieth anniversary last \r\nJuly. Iceland would like to reaffirm its commitment to \r\nthe organization and its valuable role in international \r\nnuclear cooperation and nuclear safety. The three \r\npillars of the IAEA’s Statute — safety and security, \r\nscience and technology, and safeguards and \r\nverification — remain solid. But the verification of the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear materials in order to curb the \r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons is currently facing its \r\ngreatest challenge. We as Member States cannot spare \r\nany effort to secure a high level of safety in all nuclear \r\nand radiological applications and installations. My \r\ncountry strongly supports international cooperation in \r\norder to maintain and improve safety in that area, and \r\nreiterates the important and indispensable role of the \r\nIAEA in that respect. \r\n Iceland attaches great importance to the IAEA’s \r\ntechnical cooperation work aimed at the use of nuclear \r\ntechnology in a safe, secure and sustainable manner. \r\nThat includes the areas of human health, food and \r\nagriculture, nuclear science and the management of \r\nradioactive waste. Nuclear technology plays an \r\nimportant role in combating the spread of disease and \r\nhunger, in particular in developing countries. Iceland \r\nrecognizes that valuable work, an makes an annual \r\nvoluntary contribution to the IAEA’s technology fund. \r\n We welcome recent developments with regard to \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Iceland \r\nappreciates the swift response by the IAEA in February \r\nfollowing the diplomatic breakthrough. The shutdown \r\nof the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and the \r\nimplementation of verification and monitoring \r\nmeasures by the IAEA are important first steps. We \r\nurge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\nresume the implementation of its comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreement under the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n With respect to the nuclear activities of Iran, we \r\nhope that the current work plan between the IAEA and \r\nIran will lead to a resolution of outstanding questions. \r\nEffective implementation of the work plan is of course \r\na prerequisite for any progress. However, we still have \r\nstrong concerns concerning the implications of Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme. We regret that Iran has not \r\nfulfilled its obligations under Security Council \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 2 \r\n \r\nresolutions or the requirements established by the \r\nIAEA. The Government of Iran must take steps to \r\nbuild confidence with regard to the scope and nature of \r\nits nuclear programme. We urge Iran to ratify and bring \r\ninto force the additional protocol to the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreement. \r\n In conclusion, the IAEA is indispensable for \r\nnuclear cooperation and global nuclear safety. I \r\nreiterate Iceland’s full support for the organization, and \r\nour willingness to contribute to its work and \r\ncooperation efforts. \r\n Mr. Gumbi (South Africa): My delegation would \r\nalso like to thank the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the \r\nvery insightful annual report of the Agency covering \r\nthe year 2006. We commend the Agency for yet \r\nanother elaborate and user-friendly report on \r\nachievements and shortcomings in the areas of \r\ntechnology, safety and verification, which are the three \r\npillars of the Agency’s mandate to accelerate and \r\nenlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity throughout the world. \r\n The annual report of the Agency for 2006 has \r\nonce more strengthened our correctness in recognizing \r\nthe Agency as the leading multilateral institution for \r\nensuring the peaceful uses of nuclear energy as set out \r\nin article II of the IAEA’s Statute. This annual report \r\nhas also reaffirmed my delegation’s belief that the \r\npeaceful application of nuclear energy has the potential \r\nto make a meaningful contribution to the improvement \r\nof living standards, the fight against poverty and the \r\npromotion of sustainable development, thereby \r\nstrengthening international peace and security and \r\nfacilitating the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Our meeting is taking place at a time when there \r\nis a worldwide increase in the number of countries that \r\nare considering the nuclear power option in their \r\nnational energy mix to meet their energy demands. We \r\nare indeed in an era where nuclear power is suddenly \r\ngaining prominence because of the potential it has to \r\nplace countries in a better position to enhance the \r\nsecurity of energy supplies and to mitigate the \r\ndischarge of carbon into the atmosphere, as the energy \r\nproduced from fossil fuel accounts for about half of \r\nhuman-made greenhouse gases. \r\n The rise in the demand for nuclear power comes \r\nwith challenges and responsibilities. Nuclear material \r\nand its production have become harder to control. \r\nThere is an increase in the number of countries seeking \r\nto master the nuclear fuel cycle to ensure a supply of \r\nnuclear fuel. In turn, mastering the fuel cycle, and the \r\nability arising therefrom to enrich uranium or separate \r\nplutonium, brings more countries closer to a nuclear \r\nweapons capability. Needless to say, this all has a \r\ndirect bearing on the Agency’s verification activities, \r\ntechnical cooperation assistance, nuclear fuel \r\nmanagement and nuclear safety and security. \r\n My delegation is concerned that in budgeting for \r\nthe Agency there are always inadequate funds for \r\nnecessary technological innovation investments. South \r\nAfrica believes that that situation needs to be corrected \r\nin order to extricate the Agency from the predicament \r\nof having to rely on one or a few countries’ technical \r\nresources to carry out its verification mandate. That \r\nunjustified dependency has the potential to put into \r\nquestion IAEA’s verification findings and will \r\nultimately undermine the credibility of its verification \r\nfunction. \r\n That near-crisis situation is further exacerbated \r\nby the small number of safeguards agreements between \r\nthe Agency and its member States. That matter requires \r\nour urgent and serious attention, because there are \r\nsome States that have yet to take the first basic step \r\nrequired by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) to put into force \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements with the \r\nAgency. We call on those States to fulfil their \r\nobligations under article III of the NPT as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n The Agency’s safeguards system is not a static \r\none, but it needs to be adapted to changing \r\ncircumstances. It is for that reason that South Africa \r\nsupported — unfortunately, to no avail — attempts at \r\nthe recently concluded IAEA General Conference \r\naimed at strengthening the safeguards system through \r\nthe incorporation into the safeguards resolution \r\nlanguage directly derived from article III.B, paragraph \r\n1, of the IAEA Statute, as well as from step 10 of the \r\n13 practical steps for nuclear disarmament agreed at \r\nthe 2000 NPT Review Conference. The rejection of \r\nthese proposals is a cause for concern for my \r\ndelegation and seems to represent a tendency by some \r\nMember States to renege on commitments made when \r\njoining the Agency and on their previous undertakings \r\nmade in the NPT. We also wonder if these negative \r\ndevelopments are not a manifestation of complacency \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n3 07-57052 \r\n \r\nand the false belief that the safeguards system has been \r\nperfected.  \r\n Notwithstanding, South Africa recognizes the \r\nindispensable role that the Additional Protocol can play \r\nas an additional measure to provide the necessary \r\nconfidence and the desired assurances that Member \r\nStates apply their nuclear technology solely for \r\npeaceful purposes and that no declared or undeclared \r\nmaterial is diverted to weapons programmes. South \r\nAfrica believes that countries with access to advanced \r\ntechnologies bear a greater responsibility to provide \r\nsuch assurances and to build confidence in the peaceful \r\nnature of their nuclear programmes.  \r\n Inasmuch as the Additional Protocol is voluntary, \r\nSouth Africa believes that it is an important \r\nconfidence- and security-building measure that \r\ncontinues to play an essential role in creating an \r\nenvironment conducive to nuclear disarmament and \r\nnuclear non-proliferation but that it should not be used \r\nas a condition for supplying nuclear material. As stated \r\nin previous occasions, South Africa will continue to \r\nreject that discriminatory attempt.  \r\n In addition to strengthening the Agency’s \r\nverification function in these challenging moments, \r\nSouth Africa believes the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Fund deserves urgent and decisive action. \r\nThis Fund is a statutory and political commitment that \r\nneeds to be realized. The technical cooperation projects \r\nof the Agency constitute important building blocks to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals in the \r\nareas of water security, environmental sustainability, \r\nmaternal and child health and the combating of disease, \r\nhunger and poverty.  \r\n Over the years, the developing countries have \r\nrepeatedly stressed that the funding of the Agency’s \r\ntechnical cooperation projects must be sufficient, \r\npredictable and assured. They have also stressed the \r\nneed for the technical cooperation budget to be \r\nincreased, as it is clearly not sufficient. South Africa \r\nbelieves that the time has arrived to conclusively \r\ncorrect the mistake of the past fifty years by \r\nincorporating the funding of technical cooperation \r\nprojects into the regular budget.  \r\n Likewise, my delegation expresses its fullest \r\nsupport for the proposal of the Director General to \r\nengage a high-level panel of experts to study, review \r\nand consider options for financing the Agency’s \r\nrequirements. South Africa is of the view that the \r\nfindings of this process should be engaged in a \r\nconstructive manner and be carefully considered with a \r\nview to making appropriate recommendations.  \r\n The supply of nuclear fuel is a factor that will \r\nplay a prominent role in the anticipated future growth \r\nof nuclear power. In this connection South Africa has \r\nbeen following with keen interest the debate and \r\nvarious proposals on multilateral approaches to the \r\nnuclear fuel cycle, as well as developments in the area \r\nof research reactor conversion and highly enriched \r\nuranium repatriation.  \r\n With regard to the nuclear fuel cycle, South \r\nAfrica has noted with deep concern that a number of \r\nproposals made on this matter during the last few years \r\nare geared towards restricting the right of countries to \r\ndevelop domestic capabilities. Such conditionalities do \r\nnot only contradict the inalienable right of States to \r\npursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes as \r\nprovided for in the NPT, but also exacerbate existing \r\ninequalities, including through the creation of another \r\nkind of cartel that would exclude full participation, \r\nparticularly by States in full compliance with their \r\nsafeguards obligations.  \r\n South Africa thinks that it is imperative to ensure \r\nthat no unwarranted restrictions are imposed. What is \r\nrequired is a non-discriminatory approach that would \r\nassure the reliable supply of nuclear fuel, while fully \r\nrespecting the choices of States and protecting their \r\ninalienable right to pursue peaceful nuclear \r\nprogrammes, consistent with their non-proliferation \r\nobligations.  \r\n South Africa is considering options for \r\ncooperation with other countries over the entire \r\nnuclear-fuel cycle, from the mining and processing of \r\nuranium through to nuclear power generation, fuel \r\nreprocessing and the disposal of nuclear waste. South \r\nAfrica has also produced a draft nuclear energy policy \r\nand strategy paper for public comment. Given the scale \r\nof the intended South African nuclear programme and \r\nthe need for regulatory efficiency, it is envisaged that \r\nall the regulatory functions — such as environmental, \r\ndesign, construction, operations, decommissioning and \r\ndecontamination processes — will be centralized in a \r\nsingle nuclear and radiation safety statutory agency.  \r\n While South Africa acknowledges that prevailing \r\nproliferation concerns have prompted others to propose \r\nrestrictions and controls over the legitimate peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy, it is important that such \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 4 \r\n \r\nconcerns be matched by reinforcement of the \r\nobligation to achieve nuclear disarmament.  \r\n My delegation would also like recall, for the \r\nbenefit of this gathering, its position on research \r\nreactor conversion and highly enriched uranium (HEU) \r\nrepatriation. As South Africa pointed out at the \r\nInternational Symposium on HEU in Norway in June \r\nlast year, we are supportive of national efforts towards \r\nthe conversion of civilian facilities from HEU to low \r\nenriched uranium (LEU), but we caution against \r\nattempts aimed at efforts related to the reduction of \r\nHEU for peaceful civilian purposes. Such national \r\ndecisions are indeed laudable and, in our view, are \r\ncontributing in a very real way towards minimizing the \r\ninherent risks associated with HEU. \r\n However, if we are indeed concerned about and \r\ncommitted to reducing threats to our collective \r\nsecurity, and not merely the real or perceived threats \r\nagainst a select few, we cannot exclusively focus on \r\nreducing reliance on HEU for peaceful purposes, \r\nwithout any real commitment and progress towards the \r\nelimination of HEU and other fissile materials that are \r\nprimarily being used for military purposes. In South \r\nAfrica’s view, the threat to our very existence \r\nconstituted by the continued utilization of such \r\nmaterial for weapons purposes remains as real as ever.  \r\n Nuclear safety is fast proving to be an integral \r\npart of nuclear programmes and will require serious \r\nconsideration as more countries are considering the \r\nintroduction or expansion of nuclear power. South \r\nAfrica commends the Agency for its work in the area \r\nof nuclear safety and supports the various safety \r\nstandards, guides and requirements. South Africa \r\nwelcomes the networking practices to improve the \r\nglobal nuclear safety regime and has taken the \r\ninitiative to establish an African forum of nuclear \r\nregulators to share experiences and has requested the \r\nAgency to provide guidance and assistance in this \r\nendeavour.  \r\n South Africa is committed to the use of IAEA \r\nSafety Standards as a benchmark in the implementation \r\nof our regulatory mandate and supports the IAEA \r\ninitiative related to the rationalization and \r\nharmonization of the Safety Standards. South Africa \r\nwould like to recommend a greater harmonization of \r\nthe requirements related to safety and those related to \r\nsecurity, as those requirements are interdependent in \r\nmany cases.  \r\n South Africa remains seriously concerned and \r\nshares the international community’s concern over \r\nnuclear security. South Africa agrees that the threat of \r\nnuclear terrorism is one of the challenges the world \r\nfaces in reaching our common goal of a world free of \r\nnuclear weapons. Although each and every State has \r\nthe responsibility to control and secure fissile material \r\nor other nuclear materials and to prevent such materials \r\nfrom being illegally obtained or used, relevant \r\ninstruments can and should play an important role in \r\nstrengthening our national and collective efforts in this \r\nregard. \r\n The issue of protection against nuclear terrorism \r\nlies very much at the heart of South Africa’s concerns \r\nas we may draw from the Agency’s expertise and \r\nrequire equipment for the array of security measures to \r\nbe put in place for the soccer world championship in \r\nSouth Africa in 2010. \r\n In conclusion, South Africa believes that \r\ncontinuous and irreversible progress in nuclear \r\ndisarmament and other related nuclear arms control \r\nmeasures remain fundamental to the promotion of \r\nnuclear non-proliferation. The systematic and \r\nprogressive elimination of all nuclear weapons and the \r\nassurance that they will never be produced again \r\nremains the only assurance against their use. That \r\nshould remain our goal. \r\n Nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-\r\nproliferation are two sides of the same coin, and are \r\nmutually reinforcing. The verifiable and irreversible \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons should prevent the use \r\nof nuclear weapons, irrespective of whose hands they \r\nare in. That would effectively curb their proliferation, \r\nbecause one cannot proliferate what one does not have. \r\n Last but not least, my delegation associates itself \r\nwith the statement made this morning by the \r\nAmbassador of Benin on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States. South Africa will also support, and has \r\nco-sponsored, the draft resolution on the IAEA, which \r\nwas introduced by the Chairperson of the Agency’s \r\nBoard of Governors. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): Allow \r\nme, at the outset, to express our gratitude to Mr. \r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his tireless efforts \r\nand for the insightful report to the General Assembly \r\non the main activities of the Agency during the year \r\n2006.  \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n5 07-57052 \r\n \r\n The report indicates that the Agency is \r\nincreasingly developing its activities in many areas of \r\nnuclear technology that are of great interest and \r\nimportance to the human community. The IAEA was \r\nestablished with the principal objective of accelerating \r\nand enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to \r\npeace, health and prosperity throughout the world. The \r\never-increasing demands of member States for the use \r\nof nuclear science and associated technology to \r\nsustainably meet their socio-economic requirements \r\nunderscore the need to ensure comprehensive \r\nfulfilment of the Agency’s main responsibility. \r\n It is a well-recognized fact that nuclear \r\ntechnology has broad peaceful applications in \r\nnumerous fields — ranging from food production, \r\nhuman health, water resources management and \r\nagricultural and industrial applications to providing a \r\nrenewable source of energy. In particular, the IAEA has \r\na specific mandate in relation to nuclear power. Access \r\nto reliable and adequate sources of energy is essential \r\nfor development. The demand for energy around the \r\nworld continues to increase rapidly. That has led a \r\nnumber of countries, in particular developing \r\ncountries, to embark upon planning for the \r\nconstruction of nuclear power reactors, as well as for \r\nsignificant expansion in their existing programmes. \r\n As the report indicates, for the first time, the \r\nlatest projections recognize that nuclear power will not \r\nonly help to meet the increased demand for energy \r\nsupplies but will also mitigate the discharge of carbon \r\ninto the atmosphere. In that context, efforts to \r\nstrengthen the Agency’s technical cooperation \r\nactivities aimed at improving the capabilities of \r\ndeveloping countries in nuclear energy production, as a \r\ncomponent of their energy mix, should be pursued as a \r\nmatter of priority. \r\n The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) reaffirmed the important objectives of \r\nthe Agency and recognized the inalienable right of all \r\nStates parties to the NPT to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. Under article IV of the NPT, States parties \r\nundertook to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of \r\nequipment, materials and scientific and technological \r\ninformation for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In \r\nfact, the inalienable right of all NPT States parties to \r\nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes, without \r\ndiscrimination, constitutes one of the three major \r\npillars upon which the NPT is founded.  \r\n Notwithstanding such requirements, the \r\ncooperation of developed countries — as the main \r\nsuppliers of sophisticated nuclear technology — with \r\ndeveloping nations has remained at an unsatisfactory \r\nlevel. In fact, nuclear cooperation between suppliers \r\nand recipients has been beset by restrictions, obstacles \r\nand disruptions. Instead of promoting cooperation, the \r\nclub of nuclear haves, which is laden with \r\ndiscrimination and a lack of transparency, was created, \r\ninter alia, to hamper the access of developing members \r\nof the NPT to nuclear power technology, under the \r\npretext of non-proliferation concerns. To remedy that \r\nshortcoming, the IAEA could and should play a \r\ndecisive role by vigorously pursuing balanced and \r\nnon-discriminatory application of the provisions of the \r\nNPT and IAEA safeguards.  \r\n Moreover, it is unfortunate that, after 50 years of \r\nexistence, the budget of the international cooperation \r\nsection of the Agency remains unsteady due to its \r\nvoluntary nature and the conditionality imposed by \r\ncertain member States on its allocations. \r\n The application of safeguards is among the main \r\nfunctions of the Agency. While great efforts have been \r\nmade by the Agency to apply and promote the \r\nuniversality of the safeguards system to all relevant \r\nnuclear activities, it is distressing that some members \r\nof the Agency have yet to conclude their \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements. We call on all \r\nsuch members to fulfil their obligations at the earliest \r\npossible time. \r\n Furthermore, there is a dangerous trend at work \r\nthat is moving in the opposite direction of safeguarding \r\nthe NPT and ensuring its universality. Under that trend, \r\nthose who have chosen not to accede to the NPT not \r\nonly are not subject to any pressure to do so, but are \r\nalso encouraged and rewarded in different ways. For an \r\nexample, the Zionist regime has been allowed to \r\nacquire a large stockpile of nuclear weapons in the \r\nvolatile Middle East region, and to defy the will of all \r\nthe States of the region and the international \r\ncommunity to turn the Middle East into a zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran considers the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes to be its inalienable right. We have therefore \r\ninvested extensive human and material resources in the \r\nfield of nuclear power, within the framework of the \r\ncountry’s overall economic plan. \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 6 \r\n \r\n As we have stressed time and again, Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme is completely peaceful. All reports \r\nissued by the IAEA since November 2003 have been \r\nindicative of the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme. The Agency has repeatedly reaffirmed that \r\nit “has not seen indications of diversion of nuclear \r\nmaterial to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive \r\ndevices”. That assertion has also been attested to by the \r\nDirector General of the IAEA in his various public \r\nstatements. Nevertheless, in an unwarranted move \r\norchestrated by a few of its permanent members, the \r\nSecurity Council has taken unlawful, unnecessary and \r\nunjustifiable actions against the peaceful nuclear \r\nprogramme of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Indeed, \r\nIran’s peaceful nuclear programme poses no threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. Therefore, dealing \r\nwith this issue in the Security Council is unwarranted \r\nand void of any legal basis or practical utility. \r\n Without a doubt, the move to bring the Iranian \r\nnuclear file to the Security Council and the intention of \r\nthe co-sponsors of the resolutions adopted thus far \r\nhave been derived from their ulterior motives and \r\nnarrow national considerations in order to deprive the \r\nIranian people of their inalienable rights, rather than \r\nemanating from so-called proliferation concerns. \r\n Despite the politically motivated actions by a few \r\ncountries, which have led to the deadlock and \r\ninterruption of negotiations, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran has, once again, taken a new initiative that has \r\nreceived worldwide support and appreciation. In that \r\ncontext, Iran agreed to take a major step in negotiating \r\nwith the Agency on the modalities of dealing with the \r\nfew outstanding issues. As a result of intensive \r\nnegotiations which were held between the two sides, \r\nthe final text of the mutual understanding, reflected in \r\nthe Agency’s document INFCIRC/711, was concluded \r\non 21 August 2007 in Tehran.  \r\n Bearing in mind past experience in dealing with \r\nsuch technical issues with the Agency, it was agreed \r\nthat all issues should be taken up in a sequential and \r\nwell-defined time frame, rather than dealing with them \r\nsimultaneously and without prioritization. In a very \r\nshort period of time, two of the major remaining issues, \r\nnamely plutonium experimentation and the \r\ncontamination at the Karaj facility, were resolved.  \r\n According to the agreed work plan, the issues of \r\nP-1 and P-2 centrifuges are under extensive discussion. \r\nIn order to carry these discussion forward, several \r\nmeetings have been held between Iranian and IAEA \r\nofficials in a professional and cooperative atmosphere. \r\nAt present, the new round of such meetings is taking \r\nplace in Tehran. \r\n As the IAEA Director General reported to the \r\nBoard of Governors, the agreed work plan is “a \r\nsignificant step forward”. Therefore, it is essential to \r\nnote that Iran’s initiative has created a new and \r\npositive environment that necessitates the return of its \r\nnuclear dossier to the Agency’s framework in full. In \r\nour view, the right path for the peaceful resolution of \r\nthe nuclear issue goes through dialogue and technical \r\nelaboration within its proper and legal context, which \r\nis the framework of the IAEA. \r\n In the same vein, I wish to echo the view \r\nexpressed by many delegations that the Iranian nuclear \r\nissue needs to be settled through multilateral means, \r\nand that resorting to unilateral measures would only \r\nexacerbate the situation and complicate its resolution. \r\nThere is no doubt that the recent United States \r\nunilateral measures against Iran only seek to \r\nundermine the current negotiations and cooperation \r\nbetween Iran and the Agency. In this respect, it suffices \r\nto make it clear that no number of irrational United \r\nStates policies will be able to dissuade us from \r\npursuing our legitimate rights and interests. We have \r\nalready enunciated our position on this issue in detail, \r\nboth here in New York and in the capital. \r\n Finally, the people and the Government of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran are determined to exercise \r\ntheir inalienable right to nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful purposes and to build on their own scientific \r\nadvances in developing various peaceful aspects of this \r\ntechnology. Iran commits itself to its obligations under \r\nthe NPT and does not request anything more than the \r\nexercise of its inalienable rights. \r\n Mr. Park Hee-kwon (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation to Mr. ElBaradei, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the Agency’s activities. We \r\nare pleased to take note of the Agency’s recent \r\nachievements in the fields of technology, safety and \r\nsecurity and verification, which are described in the \r\nannual report of the IAEA for 2006. In addition, my \r\ndelegation commends the Director General and his \r\nstaff for their dedication to fulfilling their \r\nresponsibilities with integrity and professionalism. \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n7 07-57052 \r\n \r\n As a strong supporter of the work of the IAEA, \r\nthe Republic of Korea underlines the importance of \r\npromoting the safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nscience and technology, and is committed to \r\nmaintaining full cooperation in all areas of the \r\nAgency’s activities. In this regard, my delegation \r\nwould like to highlight some issues that we consider \r\nrelevant to the future development of the IAEA. \r\n First, we believe that the universalization of the \r\nModel Additional Protocol is an essential means for \r\nimproving the current safeguards and verification \r\nregime. We fully share the Director General’s view that \r\nonly for those States with comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreements and the additional protocols in place will \r\nthe Agency’s ability to detect undeclared nuclear \r\nmaterial or activities be fully realized. In this regard, \r\nmy delegation hopes that those States that have not \r\ndone so will sign, ratify and fully implement additional \r\nprotocols without undue delay. \r\n Secondly, the Republic of Korea attaches great \r\nimportance to the development of a new multilateral \r\nframework for the nuclear fuel cycle. My Government \r\nsupports initiatives to develop a mechanism to provide \r\nreliable and equitable access to nuclear technologies \r\nand fuel while limiting proliferation risks. As a major \r\nuser of nuclear energy, the Republic of Korea will \r\ncontinue to participate in and make positive \r\ncontributions to the relevant discussions on this issue. \r\n Thirdly, we believe that the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy should be promoted, ensuring a high \r\nstandard of nuclear safety and security. In this regard, \r\nthe Republic of Korea will continue to support the \r\nAgency’s efforts to build and strengthen an \r\ninternational nuclear safety and security regime and \r\nfurther enhance its cooperation with the Agency. \r\n My delegation would like to take this opportunity \r\nto briefly highlight the recent developments in the Six-\r\nParty Talks process. Since the resumption of the Fifth \r\nRound of the Six-Party Talks in February of this year, \r\nthere has been significant progress in realizing the \r\nJoint Statement of 19 September 2005. On 13 February \r\n2007, the Six Parties agreed on the Initial Actions for \r\nthe Implementation of the Joint Statement, taking that \r\nconsensus forward another step by laying out specific \r\nactions to implement the Joint Statement. \r\n The 13 February agreement paved the way for \r\nre-establishing the relationship between the IAEA and \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, resulting \r\nin visits to that country by Agency teams and an \r\nagreement between the two parties on an ad hoc \r\narrangement for monitoring and verification of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic’s Yongbyon nuclear \r\nfacility. Since July of this year, the Agency has been \r\nable to verify the shutdown of the Yongbyon facility \r\nand is continuing to implement the ad hoc \r\narrangement, with the cooperation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic. \r\n My delegation welcomes the Agency’s successful \r\nimplementation of the ad hoc arrangement and \r\nreiterates its support and appreciation to the Director \r\nGeneral and his staff for conducting the monitoring and \r\nverification activities in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea in a timely, impartial and \r\nprofessional manner. \r\n Following the 13 February agreement, another \r\nstep forward was taken during the Second Session of \r\nthe Sixth Round of the Talks, held in Beijing from 27 \r\nto 30 September 2007, at which the Six Parties reached \r\nagreement on the Second-Phase Actions for the \r\nImplementation of the September 2005 Joint \r\nStatement. \r\n According to that agreement, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will complete the \r\ndisablement of the 5-megawatt experimental reactor, \r\nthe reprocessing plant and the nuclear fuel rod \r\nfabrication plant at Yongbyon by the end of this year. It \r\nis expected that the actual disablement process will \r\nstart in early November. In addition, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic will provide a complete and correct \r\ndeclaration of all of its nuclear programmes, in \r\naccordance with the 13 February agreement, within the \r\nsame time frame. The other five parties also agreed, in \r\nturn, to take corresponding measures in accordance \r\nwith the 13 February agreement. \r\n If the declaration and the disablement measures \r\nare smoothly implemented, we believe that we can \r\nachieve the main process of abandonment of these \r\nnuclear facilities by next year. Completing these \r\nsecond-phase actions in a timely manner will give \r\nimpetus to the negotiations aimed at achieving the \r\nverifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in \r\na peaceful manner. To that end, my delegation hopes \r\nthat the Six Parties will continue to take further steps \r\nwithout delay, in accordance with their commitments, \r\ntowards the full implementation of the Joint Statement. \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 8 \r\n \r\n As the Six-Party Talks process continues, my \r\nGovernment will continue to work closely with all \r\nparties concerned for a peaceful resolution of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear issue \r\nand trusts that the international community will \r\ncontinue to render its valuable support in that regard. \r\n Mr. Figueiredo (Angola): On behalf of the \r\nRepublic of Angola, it is my pleasure to congratulate \r\nthe President on his well-deserved election to preside \r\nover the work of the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Allow me also to extend my \r\ncongratulations to the other members of the Bureau. \r\nWe are confident that under his able leadership the \r\nsession will successfully conclude its work. He can be \r\nassured of our full support and cooperation. \r\n This year, we are celebrating the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the foundation of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). For the past 50 years \r\nthe organization has carried out its mandate with \r\nefficiency and credence. The Nobel Peace Prize \r\nawarded in 2005 to the Agency and to its Director \r\nGeneral, Mohamed ElBaradei, was a tribute to the \r\nprofessional and impartial performance over the last \r\nhalf century. The Angolan Government would therefore \r\nlike to reiterate its support for and full confidence in \r\nthe Director General and the secretariat. \r\n The Agency’s report in document GC(51)/5 \r\ncorrectly reflects the work carried out by the \r\norganization during the year 2006 under the three \r\npillars of its mandate, namely, technology, safety and \r\nsecurity, and verification. It clearly illustrates that the \r\nAgency continued to carry out a wide range of \r\nactivities related to the application of nuclear \r\ntechnologies in areas such as human health, food and \r\nagriculture, industry, water resources management, the \r\nenvironment, knowledge management and nuclear \r\nenergy planning and production, thereby contributing \r\nto sustainable development in Members States, \r\nespecially in the developing countries. \r\n The Agency’s Technical Cooperation Programme \r\nis the main statutory vehicle for cost-effective transfer \r\nof nuclear technologies and know-how to Member \r\nStates. To encourage greater self-reliance, the Agency \r\nhelps to build, strengthen and maintain national and \r\nregional capacities for using nuclear technology in a \r\nsafe, secure and sustainable manner.  \r\n The Technical Cooperation Programme helps \r\ndeveloping countries in matching appropriate \r\ntechnologies to identified needs and in building \r\nrelevant national technical competencies and expertise. \r\nIn that context, we wish to underscore that the \r\npromotion of the peaceful applications of atomic \r\nenergy constitutes a fundamental element of the core \r\nactivities of the Agency and is of the utmost \r\nimportance to developing countries for the \r\nimprovement of their socio-economic condition. We \r\ntherefore believe that insufficient and unpredictable \r\nfunding of the Technical Cooperation Programme \r\nwould have a negative impact on the promotional \r\nactivities.  \r\n In that connection, we wish to recall a resolution \r\nof the Agency’s General Conference, resolution \r\nGC(50)RES/12, which in its preamble states that the \r\nfinancing of technical cooperation should be in line \r\nwith the concept of shared responsibility, under which \r\nthere is a common engagement towards financing and \r\nenhancing the activities of the Agency.  \r\n The Angolan Government encourages all Member \r\nStates to pay their contributions to the regular budget \r\nand the Technical Cooperation Fund in full and on \r\ntime. The payment of extrabudgetary contributions for \r\nthe financing of projects that are Board approved but \r\nfor which no immediate funds are available for \r\nimplementation should not be neglected.  The Republic \r\nof Angola became a member of the IAEA eight years \r\nago, and we are among the States which regularly pay \r\ntheir assessed contributions to the organization. The \r\nAngolan Government appreciates the assistance from \r\nwhich the country benefits within the framework of the \r\nIAEA’s technical cooperation programme. \r\n At present, the ongoing technical cooperation \r\nprogramme consists of nine projects dealing with the \r\nestablishment of the first radiotherapy centre, \r\nintroduction of nuclear medicine techniques to clinical \r\npractices, veterinary drug residue monitoring, isotope \r\ntechniques to study the effect of bio and inorganic \r\nfertilizers, mutation breeding and the establishment of \r\nnon-destructive testing laboratories for industrial \r\napplications. \r\n Angola is also taking part in several regional and \r\ninterregional projects included in the African Regional \r\nCo-operative Agreement for Research (AFRA) \r\nprogrammes. In this context, we would like to \r\nunderline the importance of the IAEA project on \r\ncoastal zone management, which addresses the adverse \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n9 07-57052 \r\n \r\neffects of harmful algal blooms and in which Namibia \r\nand the Republic of South Africa are also participating. \r\n In addition, the IAEA has provided assistance to \r\nmy country in establishing the legal framework and \r\nregulatory infrastructure for the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. On 28 June a national atomic energy law was \r\npromulgated as an important step towards the \r\nestablishment of a national radiation protection \r\ninstitute, which will become a reality in the near future. \r\nIn this regard, we wish to thank the IAEA for its \r\nvaluable support. \r\n For the 2009-2011 technical cooperation \r\nprogramming cycle, the Angolan Government has \r\nsubmitted for the IAEA’s consideration six project \r\nconcepts in the areas of nuclear physics, agriculture, \r\nhuman health, water resources, industrial applications \r\nand radiation protection. The projects involve the use \r\nof nuclear control systems, isotope hydrology for \r\nsustainable management of groundwater resources, \r\nsustaining national capability in maintenance and \r\nrepair, improvement of beans through mutation \r\nbreeding, the extension of a nuclear physics teaching \r\nlaboratory to phase II and the strengthening of national \r\ncapacity in medical physics. For considerations of \r\nefficiency, the IAEA organizes training courses, \r\nseminars, workshops, scientific visits and fellowships \r\nand provides expert advice and equipment. \r\n My Government recognizes that the strengthening \r\nof the IAEA’s technical cooperation activities relating \r\nto the peaceful use of atomic energy, and its practical \r\napplications, will substantially contribute to the well-\r\nbeing and quality of life of the peoples of the world, \r\nparticularly those of developing member States.  \r\n However, we believe that for many developing \r\ncountries, in particular Africa, the reduction of extreme \r\npoverty and hunger by 50 per cent by 2015, as foreseen \r\nby the United Nations, requires especially the \r\neradication or control of cancer, tsetse flies and \r\ntrypanosomiasis, HIV/AIDS, anopheles mosquitoes \r\nand malaria, and locusts, among other things. All these \r\nfactors are additional hindrances to socio-economic \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Global warming as a consequence of the \r\natmospheric pollution resulting from human activity, \r\nwhich has been causing dramatic and dangerous \r\nclimate changes, has become a serious threat to \r\ndevelopment and the security of humanity. We believe \r\nthat as a first step to countering this scourge, all \r\ncountries should sign and implement the international \r\nprotocols relating to the protection of the environment, \r\nsuch as the Kyoto and Montreal Protocols. In this \r\nregard, my Government welcomes the initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General in inviting the countries that are \r\nmajor polluters of the atmosphere to contribute to its \r\nprotection more resources. \r\n With regard to cancer, we appreciate the policy of \r\nseeking to develop a strategy for the implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT). \r\nWe encourage the IAEA to proceed in its collaboration \r\nwith other relevant national, regional and international \r\norganizations to foster the development of cost-\r\neffective systems for radiation treatment of cancer. In \r\nthe same vein, we appeal to all member States to \r\ncontinue making contributions to PACT to enable the \r\nachievement of its goal, inter alia, to assist developing \r\ncountries in integrating radiotherapy into the broader \r\nframework of cancer prevention and control. We also \r\nwelcome the voluntary contributions of some member \r\nStates, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \r\nCountries Fund for International Development, the \r\nUnited States National Cancer Institute and private \r\ncorporations. \r\n Regarding the tsetse fly and the trypanosomiasis \r\ndisease it transmits, my country supports the IAEA’s \r\nactivities aimed at the eradication or control of the \r\ntsetse fly through the use of the Sterile Insect \r\nTechnique (SIT). We appreciate its continued support \r\nto African member States in their efforts to build \r\nnational capabilities and further develop techniques for \r\napplying SIT in the creation of tsetse-free zones. We \r\nalso appreciate the Agency’s support for the African \r\nUnion’s Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis \r\nEradication Campaign in its contribution to the \r\nimplementation of plan of action in some countries on \r\nthe continent. \r\n Taking into account the progress achieved in the \r\napplication of SIT in combating tsetse fly in some \r\nAfrican countries, Angola wishes to encourage the \r\nIAEA, in partnership with other relevant organizations \r\nsuch as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations and the World Health Organization, to \r\nfurther strengthen their research with a view to \r\nutilizing SIT in the control or eradication of the \r\nanopheles mosquito and malaria, locusts and other \r\ninsects which hinder the socio-economic development \r\nof the continent. In the same context, we welcome the \r\ndecision of the United Nations Regional Consultation \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 10 \r\n \r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, held \r\nin Algiers in July 2006, where methods and techniques \r\nfor the integrated campaign against locusts were \r\ndiscussed and where recommendations emerged for the \r\nintegration of nuclear applications in eliminating these \r\ninsects and in establishing regional centres for studies \r\nand training in this field. \r\n Last but not least, HIV/AIDS has been one of the \r\nmost serious public health problems in modern history \r\nsince its discovery in 1981. This disease is a far worse \r\nproblem in some parts of the world than in others. \r\nMost people infected with AIDS live in the developing \r\ncountries of Asia and Africa, while most of the deaths \r\noccur in sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS retards economic \r\ngrowth by destroying human capital and, consequently, \r\nincreasing poverty.  \r\n In this context, we encourage the IAEA, in \r\npartnership with relevant national, regional and \r\ninternational organizations, to explore new possibilities \r\nto counter this ever-growing scourge. The Angolan \r\nGovernment notes with appreciation the regional \r\nproject, Initiatives in HIV — molecular epidemiology \r\nand immunology, in support of the WHO/UNAIDS \r\nAfrican AIDS Vaccine Programme. \r\n With regard to nuclear verification, the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and arms control regime continues to \r\nface a broad set of challenges. The Government of \r\nAngola is of the view that it is important to reinforce \r\nthe monitoring of the application of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to move \r\ntowards global disarmament. We appreciate all \r\npertinent initiatives taken in compliance with United \r\nNations Charter, according to the concept of \r\nmultilateralism and the principles which govern \r\nrelations between States. That means the equality of all \r\nStates.  \r\n Angola, like the great majority of other members \r\nof the Assembly, recognizes the inalienable right of all \r\nStates to produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \r\nIn this context, my Government appreciates and \r\nsupports the initiative to assist developing countries \r\ninterested in small and medium-sized reactors, in order \r\nto address economic development while protecting the \r\nenvironment and ensuring safety and security. \r\n The Angolan Government associates itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of Benin \r\non behalf of the African States.  \r\n To conclude, the Government of the Republic of \r\nAngola recommends the approval of the report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): I wish to join previous \r\nspeakers in thanking the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for his \r\npresentation to the Assembly of the annual report of the \r\nAgency for 2006.  \r\n Malaysia highly appreciates the IAEA’s role in \r\nassisting developing Member States in planning for and \r\nin the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology \r\nfor peaceful purposes. However, more should be done \r\nto advance the inalienable rights of developing \r\nMember States, especially to develop the research, \r\nproduction and use of nuclear energy, as well as the \r\nright to participate in the fullest possible exchange of \r\nequipment, material and technology for peaceful \r\npurposes, without discrimination and in conformity \r\nwith their respective safeguards agreements, as \r\nenshrined under article IV of the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).  \r\n With regard to cooperation concerning the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear technology, I am pleased to \r\ninform the Assembly that Malaysia is one of those \r\ncountries that has greatly benefited from the IAEA’s \r\nTechnical Assistance and Cooperation Programme. \r\nInitially a Programme recipient, Malaysia is now \r\nproviding experts for IAEA missions to other \r\ndeveloping countries under the Programme. In \r\naddition, we are an active supporter of the Programme, \r\nparticularly in terms of hosting various IAEA \r\nconferences, seminars, workshops, meetings and \r\nregional training courses, as well as training Agency \r\nfellows. A substantial amount of the local \r\norganizational costs are absorbed by the Government \r\nof Malaysia. We do this because we see much value in \r\nthe Programme, particularly for developing Member \r\nStates, in developing nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes.  \r\n Despite our commitment to the Programme, we \r\nare somewhat disappointed that at times we are unable \r\nto secure places for our scientists and engineers to be \r\ntrained in the nuclear field in countries with more \r\nhighly developed nuclear technology and programmes. \r\nThis could be attributed to a tightened control regime \r\nby those countries on the transfer of nuclear and \r\nnuclear-related material, equipment and technologies.  \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n11 07-57052 \r\n \r\n While appreciating the concerns of those \r\ncountries with more advanced nuclear sectors, \r\nMalaysia wishes to reaffirm that our intention in \r\nseeking to develop indigenous expertise in peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear technology, in line with our non-\r\nproliferation and safeguards commitments under the \r\nNPT, is with a view to further contributing to the \r\nAgency’s Technical Assistance and Cooperation \r\nregime. Malaysia therefore urges the IAEA to look into \r\nthis matter with a view to finding a way forward on the \r\nissue.  \r\n Having forsworn nuclear weapons, Malaysia is of \r\nthe view that developing non-nuclear-weapon States \r\nparties to the NPT deserve to be accorded preferential \r\ntreatment in terms of access to nuclear equipment, \r\nmaterial and technology for peaceful civilian uses over \r\nStates not parties, whether through the IAEA Technical \r\nAssistance and Cooperation Programme or through \r\nbilateral arrangements.  \r\n We are now witnessing increased interest in \r\nnuclear energy as an alternative source of energy. \r\nCurrently, among the developing countries, particularly \r\nin Asia, there is a strong interest in harnessing nuclear \r\npower for meeting future energy needs. As indicated in \r\nthe IAEA report, 15 out of the 30 nuclear reactors \r\ncurrently being constructed in developing countries are \r\nlocated in Asia.  \r\n The three factors fuelling this interest, as \r\nidentified by the Director-General in his statement to \r\nthe fifty-first regular session of the IAEA General \r\nConference, on 17 September 2007, are the steady \r\ngrowth in energy demand, the increasing concerns \r\nabout energy security and the challenge of climate \r\nchange. Malaysia shares that view. Currently, Malaysia \r\ndepends on natural gas resources for over 70 per cent \r\nof its power generation. But, as a rapidly developing \r\ncountry, it will need to keep its future energy options \r\nopen.  \r\n In this connection, Malaysia maintains a keen \r\ninterest in any possible progress in the development of \r\nequitable multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel \r\ncycle. Malaysia is of the view that such arrangements \r\nregarding the nuclear fuel cycle would be beneficial to \r\ndeveloping countries in the long term, especially in \r\ncases where those countries would need to eventually \r\nembark on a nuclear power programme to help meet \r\nfuture energy demands. In that context, Malaysia views \r\nany such multilateral approach as a means of \r\nminimizing the investment costs required for any \r\ncountry to embark on nuclear power generation to help \r\nmeet its future energy demand, while also guaranteeing \r\nsupplies.  \r\n Malaysia is also of the view that a temporary \r\nvoluntary waiver of such rights as a precondition for \r\nparticipation in any such multilateral approach could \r\nbe considered. We wish to emphasize, however, that \r\nthe application of such a waiver should be effective \r\nonly for the duration of the multilateral arrangement. \r\nFurthermore, such a waiver should also be paired with \r\nan assurance of continued supply to the relevant \r\nnuclear fuel cycle services and material, as well as with \r\nappropriate guarantees, including guaranteed financial \r\nand other relevant compensation for failure of supply \r\nfor reasons other than violation or breach of nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation commitments.  \r\n That notwithstanding, Malaysia also firmly \r\nbelieves that any multilateral approach to the nuclear \r\nfuel cycle should not adversely affect the fundamental \r\ninalienable rights of the NPT States parties to develop \r\nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes, either by \r\nimposing a mandatory permanent suspension of any \r\npart of such rights as a precondition for participation \r\nby any NPT State Party in any such multilateral \r\napproach, or otherwise.  \r\n Notwithstanding Malaysia’s support for moves \r\ntowards improving the assurances of supply in the field \r\nof nuclear power generation technology, which in our \r\nview would significantly contribute towards reducing \r\nthe risks of the further proliferation of sensitive \r\ntechnologies, such moves should also not distract \r\nglobal attention away from the obligation of nuclear-\r\nweapon States to undertake to pursue negotiations in \r\ngood faith on effective measures relating to nuclear \r\ndisarmament.  \r\n Despite the overwhelming attention and emphasis \r\nplaced on ensuring nuclear non-proliferation, Malaysia \r\nremains firmly convinced that the pursuit of general, \r\ncomplete and irreversible nuclear disarmament under \r\nstrict and effective international control is the most \r\neffective way of removing the threat of nuclear \r\nweapons proliferation, and that the total elimination of \r\nsuch weapons remains the only guarantee against their \r\nuse or the threat of their use.  \r\n In the context of pursuing the aim of total \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons, Malaysia remains \r\nconcerned that a majority of the nuclear-weapon States \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 12 \r\n \r\nhave yet to conclude the Protocol to the Treaty on the \r\nSouth-East Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone. In this \r\nregard, we welcome China’s readiness to accede to the \r\nProtocol, and call upon the remaining nuclear-weapon \r\nStates to consider acceding to the Protocol at the \r\nearliest opportunity. On a related note, we welcome the \r\nestablishment of the nuclear-weapon-free zone in \r\nCentral Asia as the first such zone to be established in \r\nthe Northern Hemisphere. \r\n Malaysia also wishes to call for the prompt \r\nestablishment of a similar nuclear-weapon-free zone in \r\nthe Middle East, in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolutions 487 (1981) and 687 (1991), and relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions adopted by consensus. \r\nMalaysia also calls on Israel to accede to the NPT and \r\npromptly place all of its nuclear facilities under IAEA \r\nfull-scope safeguards, in accordance with Security \r\nCouncil resolution 487 (1981). \r\n On the implementation of the NPT Safeguards \r\nAgreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia \r\nreiterates its recognition of the IAEA as the sole \r\ncompetent authority for the verification of the \r\nsafeguards obligations of that country as well of other \r\nmember States. Malaysia believes that Iran’s \r\nwillingness to allow continuous IAEA inspection and \r\nverification of its nuclear facilities will help in gaining \r\nthe trust and in building the confidence of the \r\ninternational community in the peaceful nature of its \r\nnuclear programme. In this regard, Malaysia welcomes \r\nthe positive developments concerning Iran’s \r\ncooperation with the IAEA and hopes that all \r\noutstanding questions over the Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme can be resolved in an amicable and \r\nmutually agreeable manner. \r\n Similarly, Malaysia welcomes the positive actions \r\ntaken on the part of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, particularly its decision to shut down the \r\nYongbyon nuclear facility and in allowing IAEA \r\ninspectors access to its nuclear facilities, pursuant to \r\nthe 13 February agreement. Malaysia views such \r\nactions as significant confidence-building measures \r\nthat could contribute towards efforts aimed at \r\nachieving the denuclearization of the Korean \r\nPeninsula. Malaysia remains convinced of the value of \r\nthe Six-Party Talks process, particularly in terms of \r\nreaching a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear issue, \r\nand we hope that all concerned parties will continue to \r\nremain committed to the process. \r\n In conclusion, Malaysia would like to express \r\nonce again its appreciation to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, \r\nDirector General of the IAEA, as well as to the IAEA \r\nsecretariat for their significant and valuable work in \r\nupholding the three pillars of the Agency’s mandate — \r\nnamely, nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation \r\nand peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\n Mr. Pramudwinai (Thailand): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation wishes to congratulate the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on its fiftieth \r\nanniversary this year and for its achievements, notably \r\nthe progress made on the workplan with Iran and the \r\nmonitoring, verification and disablement of the \r\nYongbyon nuclear facilities in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. We strongly encourage and support \r\nIran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\ncontinue their cooperation with the IAEA in order to \r\nmaintain the momentum of creating an environment \r\nconducive to peace and prosperity in the region. \r\n Thailand also wishes to express its support for the \r\nbroadening of the IAEA’s mandate in promoting and \r\nregulating the peaceful uses of nuclear power for \r\ndevelopment. Thailand stands ready to work with the \r\nIAEA in improving nuclear safety and security towards \r\nthe objective of nuclear non-proliferation through \r\neffective safeguards and verification measures. In this \r\nconnection, we welcome the IAEA’s five new \r\nmembers, and the 11 incoming members of the \r\nAgency’s Board of Governors. \r\n Thailand notes with satisfaction the IAEA’s 2006 \r\nAnnual Report, in particular the new initiatives and \r\nimplementation of nuclear application programmes in \r\nvarious fields. In our view, nuclear technology \r\napplications constitute an area where the constructive \r\nrole of the IAEA in promoting the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear power deserves more emphasis and active \r\nsupport. \r\n As the fifty-eighth member of the IAEA and one \r\nof its founding members — since 1957 — and current \r\nmember of the Board of Governors for the term 2006-\r\n2008, Thailand fully complies with the Agency’s rules \r\nand regulations and with all relevant codes of conduct \r\non the safety and security of radioactive sources. We \r\nwelcome the keynote address by Mr. Mohamed \r\nElBaradei, the IAEA’s Director General, at the Sixth \r\nCongress on Science and Technology for Development \r\nin Thailand on 16 July 2007, where the role of nuclear \r\npower as an engine for development was underscored. \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n13 07-57052 \r\n \r\nIn particular, we fully support the view that the role of \r\nnuclear energy in relation to sustainable development \r\nneeds to be re-evaluated in the context of emerging and \r\ninterrelated issues — namely, energy security and \r\nclimate change. \r\n As a State party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty (NPT), Thailand recognizes and supports the \r\ninalienable right of all States to develop, research, \r\nproduce and utilize nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes, without discrimination, under the NPT. \r\nAcknowledging the symbiotic linkage between energy, \r\nsecurity and development, and the exigencies of \r\nclimate change resulting from the use of fossil fuels, \r\nThailand considers nuclear power to be one of the \r\nsources of viable alternative energy options and \r\ntherefore welcomes the reassessment of its role in \r\nsustainable development in accordance with both \r\nAgenda 21 and the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n As there is a need to diversify energy sources and \r\nto reduce dependency on fossil fuels, Thailand looks to \r\nnuclear energy. In July of this year, Thailand \r\nannounced its plan to develop nuclear energy under the \r\nNational Power Development Plan for the next 14 \r\nyears, in which nuclear-powered electricity generation \r\nis envisaged by 2021. The Office of Atoms for Peace of \r\nThailand, as the national regulatory body, together with \r\nThailand’s Institute of Nuclear Technology and the \r\nNational Energy Policy Council, as the operational and \r\npolicymaking bodies, respectively, have already \r\ncommenced work with the IAEA on issues relating to \r\nthe necessary educational, industrial, legal, and \r\ninstitutional instruments. Thailand’s Nuclear Power \r\nInfrastructure Preparatory Committee has also already \r\nbeen set up. \r\n Thailand further welcomes the IAEA’s active role \r\nin applying nuclear technology for other development \r\npurposes, especially in the fields of medicine, food and \r\nagriculture, environmental management and industry. \r\nThailand thus encourages countries to work with the \r\nIAEA in reporting their progress in fulfilling \r\ninternational obligations regarding the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy and in strengthening the \r\nimplementation of safeguards systems. \r\n The report, which outlines programmes and \r\nactivities undertaken by the IAEA in conjunction with \r\nits member States, provides encouraging signs that the \r\nAgency is taking the right approach in supporting the \r\nrights of its members to utilize nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes and in strengthening its legal and \r\ninstitutional role in safety and verification regimes.  \r\n With regard to strategies on non-proliferation \r\nissues, Thailand welcomes the IAEA’s efforts to \r\nexplore multilateral mechanisms to ensure reliable \r\nsupply of and access to fuel cycle services for States \r\nthat choose not to acquire full fuel cycle capabilities. \r\n Regarding the Technical Cooperation Fund \r\n(TCF), Thailand applauds the important role the TCF \r\nhas been playing in strengthening technology transfer \r\nand promoting scientific and technological cooperation \r\nin areas such as basic human needs and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, additional emphasis must \r\nbe given to how the Fund could be used and managed \r\nmore effectively without sacrificing the benefits of \r\nnuclear technology to Member States.  \r\n Finally, Thailand reiterates its support for the \r\nindispensable role of the IAEA in nuclear technology, \r\nsafety and verification for the peace and prosperity of \r\nits member States and the international community. \r\nThailand commends the IAEA for its integrity, \r\nimpartiality and professionalism in promoting and \r\nensuring the peaceful uses of nuclear energy for \r\ndevelopment, and hence its competence and central \r\nrole as part of the disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nagenda. \r\n Mrs. Mladineo (Croatia): Croatia has aligned \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nPortugal on behalf of the European Union. I shall \r\ntherefore limit my remarks to a few issues of particular \r\ninterest to my country. \r\n At the outset, let me stress that, following last \r\nyear’s election to the Board of Governors of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the \r\nGovernor from Croatia was elected Vice-Chairman of \r\nthe Board this September. This result confirms our \r\nreadiness to play a constructive part in IAEA activities. \r\nMoreover, it demonstrates Croatia’s appreciation of the \r\nAgency’s unique contribution to peace, security and \r\ndevelopment in the world at this difficult and critical \r\ntime for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\n Let me also express Croatia’s appreciation for the \r\nAgency’s comprehensive annual report. I would like to \r\nthank the Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, for \r\npresenting the report this morning. Croatia fully \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 14 \r\n \r\nsupports its substance and is again pleased to be among \r\nthe sponsors of the draft resolution on the report. \r\n Croatia commends the Agency for the successful \r\ncontinuation of its wide-ranging activities in the fields \r\nof technology, safety and verification. We particularly \r\nsupport efforts to continuously upgrade and develop \r\nthe Agency’s concepts and means to effectively address \r\ndangerous new trends in nuclear proliferation. \r\n The Agency was established 50 years ago to \r\npromote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear \r\ntechnologies. In this regard, Croatia reiterates that \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements together with \r\nthe Additional Protocols constitute the current IAEA \r\nverification standard. Achieving the universal \r\napplication of a strengthened safeguards system is an \r\nurgent priority, and the fact that more than 100 \r\ncountries have yet to bring into force their additional \r\nprotocols is a cause of great concern. At the same time, \r\nthere is a parallel need to increase the Agency’s \r\nverification resources to enable it to deal effectively \r\nwith growing verification demands. \r\n Croatia supports the Agency’s activities in the \r\narea of strengthening national capacities in order to \r\nprevent proliferation and increase nuclear security. \r\nNational measures should include improvement of \r\nexport and import controls, strengthening of border \r\ncontrols, re-evaluation of legislative frameworks, more \r\nfrequent exchanges of relevant information at the \r\nnational and international levels, and the improvement \r\nof public awareness on the issue of proliferation. \r\n Croatia signed and ratified the Additional \r\nProtocol, the amendment to article VI of the IAEA \r\nstatute and the amendment to the Convention on the \r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material. Croatia also \r\nsupports the Code of Conduct on the Safety and \r\nSecurity of Radioactive Sources and the supplementary \r\nguidance on the import and export of radioactive \r\nsources. \r\n One of the most beneficial aspects of successful \r\ncooperation between Croatia and the Agency has been \r\nwithin the framework of its technical cooperation \r\nprogramme, where the Agency supports five ongoing \r\nprojects in Croatia, together with its contributions to \r\nand co-organization of workshops and seminars hosted \r\nby Croatia, addressing issues of non-proliferation, \r\nradiation protection and the fight against trafficking \r\nand potential threats by terrorists against the security \r\nof nuclear and radioactive material. \r\n In that context, we are also pleased to have \r\nstrengthened our role in the region, bearing in mind the \r\nimportance of coordinated and effective regional \r\nmeasures aimed at maximizing the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy and confronting the growing risks of \r\nproliferation and nuclear terrorism. \r\n As the role of the Agency continues to expand, \r\nthe challenges it faces remain important and difficult. \r\nThe annual report makes it perfectly clear that these \r\nchallenges can be addressed only by partnering \r\nwith its stakeholders: member States, international \r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations, \r\nnational counterparts and the public. Croatia pledges \r\nits unequivocal commitment to that partnership as we \r\nmove along the path towards sustainable non-\r\nproliferation and genuine “atoms for peace”. \r\n Mr. Rachkov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): This \r\nyear, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\nis celebrating its fiftieth anniversary. In its 50 years of \r\nexistence, the Agency has acquired exclusive status as \r\nthe leading international body capable of dealing with \r\nthe question of the safe use of nuclear power for \r\npeaceful purposes and for ensuring effective control \r\nover the implementation of international obligations \r\nrelating to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  \r\n States members of the Agency and its secretariat \r\nare doing truly colossal work. As part of its technical \r\ncooperation programme, the IAEA is providing \r\ninterested member States with multifaceted assistance \r\nin making use of cutting-edge nuclear technology. Very \r\ncareful work is being done to ensure a global system of \r\nnuclear and radiological security. An action plan to \r\ncombat nuclear terrorism is being carried out. \r\nMeasures are being taken to enhance the physical \r\nprotection of nuclear and radioactive materials. \r\nConsistent steps are being taken to ensure the \r\nuniversalization of the nuclear non-proliferation regime \r\nand to enhance the effectiveness of the IAEA \r\nsafeguards system. Work is also being done to protect \r\nnuclear knowledge and train nuclear specialists.  \r\n Belarus has been actively promoting the \r\nimplementation of all of these activities in the work of \r\nIAEA. Our country is fully behind the activities of the \r\nagency in its work towards achieving the IAEA slogan, \r\n“Atoms for peace”. We believe that all of the \r\nmachinery available in the Agency should be used to \r\nthe maximum extent possible in order to achieve those \r\naims. We consider the machinery for technical \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n15 07-57052 \r\n \r\ncooperation within IAEA today as the most important \r\ninstrument for transmitting and implementing up-to-\r\ndate nuclear ideas, technology and experience.  \r\n The implementation of technical cooperation \r\nprojects by the Agency in Belarus have provided \r\nconsiderable assistance to national efforts in a number \r\nof areas relating to the possible use of nuclear know-\r\nhow and technology. Moreover, Belarus suffered the \r\nfull brunt of the Chernobyl tragedy, and the success of \r\nmutual assistance as part of its cooperation with  \r\nIAEA has made it possible to implement a number of \r\nsocio-economic and medical measures that have \r\nallowed for the rehabilitation of the damaged regions \r\nand have ensured their sustainable development. \r\n At this stage of its existence, IAEA is particularly \r\nimportant in terms of cooperation with member States \r\nthat are interested in setting up their own nuclear \r\npower programmes. We are pleased to note that IAEA \r\nactivities along those lines are becoming more \r\nsystematic in nature. That is particularly important \r\ngiven the increasing number of Governments that have \r\nannounced their intentions to implement national \r\nprogrammes to develop nuclear power, including \r\nprojects to construct nuclear power stations on their \r\nterritory. In that context, a very promising area of work \r\nfor the Agency is its evaluation of new approaches to \r\nthe nuclear fuel cycle to ensure guaranteed supplies of \r\nnuclear fuel to interested consumers.  \r\n Belarus is a convinced and consistent supporter \r\nof enhancing and ensuring the universalization of the \r\nnon-proliferation regime, and we have unfailingly \r\ndischarged our obligations under the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the \r\nsafeguards agreements. We are aware of the complexity \r\nand the multifaceted nature of the implementation of \r\nthe NPT, but we nonetheless do believe that \r\ncooperation under that Treaty should lead to positive \r\nexperiences in implementing all of its provisions, \r\nincluding the IAEA safeguards agreement.  \r\n In that connection, any country that discharges its \r\nobligations under the NPT should have unimpeded \r\naccess to the development of its nuclear power.  \r\n The delegation of Belarus is pleased to note that \r\nthe IAEA resolution on strengthening the Agency’s \r\nactivities in the field of technical cooperation reflects \r\nthe value of the Agency’s contribution to international \r\nefforts in overcoming the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl accident. The Government of Belarus \r\nintends to continue to create favourable conditions for \r\nthe Agency in its work to mitigate the consequences of \r\nthe catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. \r\nWe call on all member States of the Agency to support \r\nIAEA activities in that very important area. \r\n Mr. Akram (Pakistan): I would like to thank \r\nMr. ElBaradei, Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for presenting the \r\nannual report of the Agency. Pakistan appreciates the \r\nrole played by IAEA in promoting the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy in the diverse areas of power \r\ngeneration, health and medicine, agriculture, \r\nhydrology, industry, environment and basic sciences. \r\nWe assure Mr. ElBaradei and his colleagues of our full \r\nsupport and cooperation in achieving progress and \r\nprosperity for all. \r\n IAEA has completed five decades working as a \r\nsuccessful organization. Its role as the world’s focal \r\npoint in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy \r\nassumes greater significance in view of the rapidly \r\ngrowing global energy demand and shortage of fossil \r\nfuel reserves, as well as the diverse challenges of the \r\nenvironment and proliferation.  \r\n The Agency’s report for 2006 underscores the key \r\nrole of nuclear power in enhancing the security of \r\nenergy supply while also mitigating the discharge of \r\ncarbon into the atmosphere. The Agency can make a \r\nsignificant contribution to meeting the needs and \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century by ensuring \r\nequitable access to nuclear materials, technology and \r\nequipment for peaceful purposes. \r\n Pakistan attaches the highest importance to the \r\ntechnical cooperation programme of the IAEA. We \r\nhave benefited from and contributed to the technical \r\ncooperation programme.  \r\n Pakistan was one of the earliest countries to \r\nlaunch a programme of nuclear power generation and \r\nhave developed the entire range of nuclear fuel cycle \r\nfacilities. Parallel to the development of the nuclear \r\nfuel cycle, I would briefly draw attention to our \r\nachievements in other sectors. \r\n In the area of nuclear research, the Pakistan \r\nInstitute of Nuclear Science and Technology has \r\nemerged as a major research institution in the region \r\nfor basic and applied research in the fields of nuclear \r\nphysics, nuclear chemistry, nuclear materials, nuclear \r\nengineering, radioisotope production and applications.  \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 16 \r\n \r\n The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission is \r\nplaying a vital role in the application of nuclear science \r\nand technology in the human health sector. The \r\nCommission has so far established 13 nuclear medicine \r\nand oncology centres and institutions throughout the \r\ncountry for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The \r\nPAEC is also collaborating with international agencies \r\nsuch as the IAEA, the Japan International Cooperation \r\nAgency, the International Union Against Cancer, the \r\nWorld Health Organization and others in technical \r\ncooperation projects, providing training for technical \r\nhuman resource development. \r\n The PAEC has been playing a major role in \r\nharnessing nuclear techniques in agriculture and other \r\nbiological research since its inception. Our National \r\nInstitute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering is \r\na centre dedicated to the application of biotechnology \r\nin agriculture, industry, health and environment. The \r\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission has also \r\nestablished research laboratories in the fields of isotope \r\nhydrology and isotope ecology.  \r\n With a sizeable civilian nuclear programme and \r\ndecades of experience in nuclear operations in the \r\nareas of power generation, health, medicine, \r\nagriculture, biotechnology and industrial applications, \r\nPakistan is uniquely placed to offer cooperation in \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy to developing countries \r\nunder IAEA safeguards. We look forward to further \r\nstrengthening our participation in the IAEA’s \r\npromotional activities. \r\n Since the foundation of the atomic energy \r\nprogramme, Pakistan has always recognized that \r\nnuclear safety and security in the national and \r\ninternational context is a vital objective. We have \r\ntherefore established strong safety and security \r\ninfrastructure, including a strong and independent \r\nPakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA). \r\nPakistan is a party to the Nuclear Safety Convention, \r\nthe Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial and other relevant IAEA instruments. Nuclear \r\nsafety arrangements at civilian facilities in Pakistan are \r\nsubjected to peer reviews and regular inspections by \r\nIAEA missions. On the security side, the PNRA \r\nrequires all operators to implement the security \r\narrangements as contained in IAEA document \r\nINFCIRC/225/Rev.4, which constitutes the current \r\ninternational standard in this regard. \r\n The PNRA is implementing a National Nuclear \r\nSecurity Action Plan which aims at, first, strengthening \r\nthe security of nuclear and radioactive materials and \r\nfacilities containing such materials; secondly, \r\nprevention and detection of illicit trafficking in nuclear \r\nand radioactive materials; and, thirdly, responding to \r\nincidents of illicit trafficking and emergencies. The \r\nPNRA is cooperating with the IAEA for capacity-\r\nbuilding in this context. \r\n Pakistan’s economy has expanded at an average \r\nannual growth rate of 7 per cent from 2002 to 2007. \r\nElectricity demand increased at 8 per cent per annum. \r\nAt the current rate of growth, the demand for \r\nelectricity would increase from 20,000 megawatts at \r\npresent to 163,000 megawatts by 2030. \r\n Pakistan’s indigenous energy resources are \r\nlimited. The Government of Pakistan has therefore \r\nlaunched a 25-year Energy Security Plan to cater for \r\nthe rising demand for energy. The strategy for the \r\ndevelopment of the power sector is maximum \r\nutilization of indigenous energy resources to reduce \r\ndependence on imported fuels. Nuclear power \r\ngeneration will be an indispensable element in our \r\nnational energy security strategy.  \r\n This Energy Security Plan envisages increase in \r\nnuclear power generation capacity from the present \r\n425 megawatts to 8,800 megawatts by the year 2030, \r\nrepresenting an increase in the proportion of energy \r\nthat nuclear electricity generation will supply from the \r\n0.8 per cent to 4.2 per cent. This will entail setting up \r\nseveral additional nuclear power reactors.  \r\n To support the planned expansion of nuclear \r\npower in Pakistan, we have embarked upon the \r\nestablishment of a uranium conversion and enrichment \r\nfacility that will cater for the needs for fuel of our \r\nnuclear power plants. At the last IAEA General \r\nConference, Pakistan made an announcement \r\nconcerning the possibility of placing this facility under \r\nIAEA safeguards. This voluntary measure would be \r\nfacilitated through Pakistan’s non-discriminatory \r\nintegration into the international arrangements for \r\npeaceful nuclear cooperation. \r\n Pakistan has been closely following recent \r\nproposals and initiatives on assurances of supply of \r\nnuclear fuel. The basis of acceptance of any such \r\nmechanism will be that of trust in the system. It should \r\nencourage expansion of nuclear power through the \r\nassured supply of nuclear fuel and other related \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n17 07-57052 \r\n \r\nservices in a non-discriminatory manner. Above all, \r\nconsistent with the existing realities, any such \r\nmechanism should include all States with advanced \r\nfuel cycle capabilities, without discrimination. In \r\nparticular, the report of the Expert Group established \r\nby the Director General of the IAEA emphasizes the \r\nneed to make the three non-NPT States partners of the \r\nmultilateral nuclear fuel cycle approach. It also \r\nenvisages the establishment of nuclear parks in \r\ncountries under IAEA supervision. \r\n Pakistan recognizes the important role played by \r\nthe IAEA verification regime. We have fully complied \r\nwith our obligations pursuant to our safeguards \r\nagreements with the IAEA. We share the view that all \r\nStates should fully comply with their safeguards \r\nobligations and international commitments. The most \r\nimportant step towards maintaining the credibility of \r\nthe safeguards regime is the fulfilment of their legal \r\nobligations by all States. A balance between the \r\nAgency’s regulatory, promotional and safety functions \r\nwill ensure the continuing relevance of the Agency in \r\nthe twenty-first century in the context of promoting the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy as well as non-\r\nproliferation. \r\n In conclusion, let me say that the international \r\ncommunity has well recognized and commended the \r\nvital role that Director General ElBaradei and the \r\nIAEA are playing in the promotion of peaceful nuclear \r\ncooperation and non-proliferation. Mr. ElBaradei’s \r\nremarks regarding several current issues deserve close \r\nconsideration by all the concerned parties.  \r\n There is a disconnect, however, between the call \r\nof some for full-scope safeguards and the additional \r\nprotocol as the standard for peaceful nuclear \r\ncooperation, and their simultaneous readiness to \r\nconsider selective exceptions from such standards. \r\nPakistan supports the Director General’s call for a new \r\nframework for the use of nuclear energy that responds \r\nto “the lessons we have learned and the current reality” \r\n(A/62/PV.36). And this will have to be done on a non-\r\ndiscriminatory basis. We also welcome the recognition \r\nof the linkage between non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament. For its part, for the past several years, \r\nPakistan has called for evolving a new consensus on \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation which would \r\nencompass the new framework for the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy. We hope that the Secretary-General \r\nwill consider convening an international conference or \r\na special session of the General Assembly to help in \r\nevolving such a new consensus. \r\n Ms. Mohamed-Noor (Singapore): My delegation \r\nwould first like to thank the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. \r\nMohamed ElBaradei, for his comprehensive report. \r\nThe IAEA continues to do excellent work, despite the \r\nchallenges it faces. That is testimony to the skill and \r\nleadership of its Director General. We believe that the \r\nIAEA should continue to be the global focal point for \r\nnuclear cooperation, in line with its three pillars of \r\ntechnology, safety and security and verification. \r\n Last year, we were focused on nuclear \r\ndevelopments in Iran and the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. This year, we welcome the closure \r\nof the Yongbyon nuclear facility in the latter country, \r\nas verified by the IAEA, and the return of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to the Six-\r\nParty Talks. Continuing cooperation between the IAEA \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\nlead to enhanced security in the Korean peninsula. In \r\ntandem, we hope that Iran will also continue to \r\ncooperate with the IAEA in building confidence and \r\nresolving the outstanding questions pertaining to its \r\nnuclear programme. \r\n The Asia-Pacific region’s demand for energy has \r\nincreased with its rapid economic development. This \r\ndemand can only become more pronounced in the \r\nfuture. At present, fossil fuels meet most of Asia’s \r\nenergy needs. The question going forward is whether \r\nthis situation can continue. Fossil fuels are finite and \r\nnot always easy to extract; high oil prices are one \r\nmanifestation of this. There are also concerns about the \r\npollutive effects of fossil fuels and how fossil fuel \r\nemissions contribute to climate change. With these \r\nconcerns in mind, it is no surprise that many countries \r\nare exploring alternative sources of energy that may be \r\ncleaner and more stable in terms of price and long-term \r\navailability. In short, many countries are looking at \r\nnuclear power. \r\n Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), States have the sovereign \r\nright to use nuclear energy for peaceful means. \r\nHowever, countries that explore the nuclear energy \r\noption also have a grave responsibility to carefully \r\nconsider safety issues. Accidents involving nuclear \r\nfacilities have horrible effects that range over great \r\ndistances and manifest themselves over a very lengthy \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 18 \r\n \r\nperiod of time. One need only hark back to the \r\nChernobyl tragedy of more than 20 years ago. Just this \r\nyear, there was a fire and a leak at the Kashiwazaki-\r\nKariwa nuclear plant when an earthquake struck \r\nNiigata province in Japan. \r\n States newly considering nuclear power should \r\nalso adopt measures to assuage concerns about safety \r\nand security issues. The IAEA’s Department of Nuclear \r\nSafety and Security has a pivotal role to play in helping \r\nthese countries achieve the necessary safety standards. \r\nThe IAEA can help States build capacity regarding \r\nsafety and security issues associated with the use of \r\nnuclear energy. We fully support the Department’s \r\nobjective of a strong, sustainable and visible global \r\nsafety regime that provides for the protection of people \r\nand the environment from the effects of ionizing \r\nradiation, for the minimization of the likelihood of \r\naccidents or malicious acts that could endanger life and \r\nproperty and for the effective mitigation of the effects \r\nof any such incidents. In this regard, we welcome the \r\nIAEA’s activities to build, strengthen and maintain \r\nnational and regional capacities for using nuclear \r\ntechnology in a safe, secure and sustainable manner, \r\nand we encourage the IAEA to continue these \r\nactivities. \r\n The IAEA should also continue its technical \r\ncooperation with relevant countries and explore more \r\npartnerships and cooperation with other players in the \r\nnuclear energy market. States should draw on the \r\nIAEA’s expertise in these areas. \r\n Singapore supports the IAEA’s objective of \r\nproviding authoritative guidance and advice on nuclear \r\nsafety approaches, policies and principles. To this end, \r\nIAEA’s safety standards are of paramount importance \r\nand provide a widely accepted basis for nuclear safety. \r\nStates considering nuclear power should look towards \r\nthese international standards in setting their own \r\nguidelines and should build on the IAEA’s framework \r\nwhen developing nuclear safety regimes. Singapore \r\nthus welcomes the IAEA’s efforts to extend its safety \r\nand security standards and best practices throughout \r\nthe world. \r\n We support the introduction of a new IAEA \r\nsafety review initiative, the Integrated Regulatory \r\nReview Service, the adoption of the Fundamental \r\nSafety Principles by the IAEA Board of Governors, and \r\nthe continuation of the IAEA’s peer review mechanism. \r\nThese initiatives will help countries and regional \r\norganizations build up a body of standards, knowledge \r\nand expertise on nuclear safety issues. \r\n Importantly, the effectiveness of the IAEA \r\nnecessarily depends in large part on cooperation from \r\nStates. States should continue to work, in cooperation \r\nwith the IAEA, on creating a culture of safety among \r\nnuclear regulators, operators and employees. Regional \r\nsafety and security regimes under the auspices of the \r\nIAEA, such as the Asian Nuclear Safety Network, are \r\nuseful in building up State capacity based on the \r\nIAEA’s safety protocols and standards. \r\n Within the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN), we also recognize the IAEA’s role \r\nand expertise in the area of safety. The plan of action \r\nthat was adopted by ASEAN Foreign Ministers in July \r\nto implement the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free \r\nZone, for instance, calls for ASEAN to work with the \r\nIAEA and other partners in developing a legal \r\nframework to meet international standards on nuclear \r\nsafety. ASEAN energy ministers, at their annual \r\nmeeting in Singapore on 23 August 2007, also \r\nendorsed in principle the establishment of a nuclear \r\nenergy safety subsector network to discuss nuclear \r\nsafety issues. \r\n These developments go hand in hand with efforts \r\nto look for alternative, carbon-free and sustainable \r\nenergy sources. In this regard, ASEAN looks forward \r\nto working closely with the IAEA in developing a \r\nregional framework of collaboration and cooperation, \r\nas well as adopting the best practices in this field. We \r\nbelieve this is timely, as more South-East Asian \r\ncountries have either indicated an interest in or are \r\npursuing nuclear energy programmes, in line with \r\nincreasing energy needs. We believe that, for their part, \r\ncompanies involved in the provision of nuclear energy \r\nplants must also help ensure that nuclear power plants \r\nmeet the highest safety standards. This includes issues \r\nsuch as location and design, the management and \r\ndisposal of spent nuclear fuel and human capacity to \r\nrun the plants properly. \r\n The IAEA’s role in building confidence about the \r\nsafety and security aspects of nuclear energy is crucial. \r\nNuclear energy is obviously an option for States \r\nconsidering alternative sources of energy. But those \r\nsame States must ensure that this energy can be \r\nsourced safely. Cooperation with the IAEA in \r\ndeveloping their nuclear power is essential for those \r\nStates’ — and, indeed, the wider regions’ — safety and \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n19 07-57052 \r\n \r\nsecurity. It would be tragic if nuclear energy became \r\nthe source of future problems. Singapore believes that \r\nthe IAEA can continue to do good work in this regard. \r\n Singapore will continue to support the IAEA’s \r\nmission and activities in the future. \r\n Mr. Kryzhanivskyi (Ukraine): Ukraine has \r\naligned itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Portugal on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU) and associated countries. Therefore, I shall \r\nlimit my remarks to a few issues of particular \r\nimportance to my country. \r\n At the outset, on behalf of the Government of \r\nUkraine, I would like to congratulate the new States \r\nmembers of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) — the Republic of Cape Verde, the Republic of \r\nthe Congo, the Republic of Burundi, the Kingdom of \r\nBahrain and Nepal — and to wish them every success \r\nin their activities within the Agency. The enlargement \r\nof the IAEA’s membership is additional evidence of the \r\nAgency’s growing authority. \r\n As is known, Ukraine voluntarily renounced what \r\nwas then the world’s third largest nuclear weapons \r\narsenal. That is further evidence that we are a country \r\nfor which the peaceful use of nuclear energy is one of \r\nthe fundamental principles of sustainable development \r\nfor all nations seeking a more secure and predictable \r\nenvironment. \r\n We share the view that it is necessary to expand \r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy in a safe and secure \r\nmanner, with reduced risk of proliferation. That is the \r\nidea behind the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, \r\nwhich we joined on l6 September 2007 by signing its \r\nStatement of Principles. \r\n Regarding the Agency’s activity in evaluating the \r\nworldwide long-term use of nuclear energy, my country \r\nattaches special importance to the IAEA’s work in \r\nstudying the options for meeting energy demands. We \r\nnote and value the initiative of the Agency on the \r\ncreation of a non-discriminatory mechanism of nuclear \r\nfuel supply. We believe that a guaranteed nuclear fuel \r\nsupply, in conformity with the principle of nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and under the Agency’s auspices, will \r\nbe essential in improving the energy independence and \r\nsecurity of Member States, especially developing ones. \r\n Since my country suffered the world’s worst \r\nnuclear accident, at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, we \r\npay special attention to compliance with effective \r\nsafety standards and to ensuring that these are in \r\naccordance with internationally recognized norms. \r\nSafety performance indicators at Ukrainian nuclear \r\npower plants meet the requirements of national and \r\ninternational norms in this sphere, which was \r\nconfirmed by Operational Safety Review Team \r\nmissions to Ukrainian nuclear power plants. \r\nNevertheless, my country continues to upgrade its \r\napproaches to nuclear power plant safety improvement. \r\nWe do this at the national level and in the framework \r\nof international cooperation. We also update legislation \r\nin the field of nuclear energy use, and we strengthen \r\nrelevant institutional capabilities of the national \r\nregulatory authority.  \r\n It is my pleasure to note that the enhancement of \r\nnuclear security, the improvement of nuclear materials \r\nand the security of radioactive sources worldwide \r\nremain among the Agency’s priorities. My country \r\nattaches special importance to activity aimed at \r\nsupporting the Illicit Trafficking Database because it \r\ngives an opportunity to assess trends in this sphere for \r\nfurther improvement, development and implementation \r\nof measures aimed at securing the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime. We have actively participated \r\nin that programme since 1997, and we call upon all \r\nMember States to engage more actively in exchanges \r\nof information with the Database.  \r\n My country considers the Comprehensive \r\nSafeguards System as an important tool to ensure the \r\nabsence of undeclared activities and of the diversion of \r\nrelated nuclear materials. We are confident that the \r\nsafeguards agreements, together with additional \r\nprotocols, should constitute the IAEA verification \r\nstandard. Ukraine encourages all States that still have \r\nnot done so to sign, ratify and implement \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements without further \r\ndelay.  \r\n My country fulfils its international obligations in \r\naccordance with the provisions of the Additional \r\nProtocol on safeguards between Ukraine and the IAEA. \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to once again \r\nexpress our gratitude to the Agency for its assistance in \r\nimplementing the Additional Protocol in Ukraine.  \r\n We reaffirm our position that achievement of the \r\nuniversality of the safeguards system must be \r\nconsidered a priority task by the Agency. The IAEA \r\nmust devote special attention to safeguards \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 20 \r\n \r\nimplementation in countries striving to develop nuclear \r\nactivities. \r\n It is well known that the issues of the mitigation \r\nof consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the \r\ntransformation of the shelter object at the Chernobyl \r\nnuclear power plant into an environmentally sound \r\nsystem remain among the priorities for Ukraine.  \r\n I am pleased to inform the General Assembly that \r\nin September the contracts in the construction of a new \r\nsafe confinement over the shelter and of an interim \r\nspent fuel storage facility for the Chernobyl site were \r\nsigned in Kyiv. We appreciate highly the efforts of all \r\nthe countries involved, contributors and donors to the \r\nChernobyl Shelter Fund and the Nuclear Safety \r\nAccount of the European Bank for Reconstruction and \r\nDevelopment for their valuable contributions that made \r\nthe conclusion of those contracts possible. We are \r\nconvinced that the implementation of the contracts will \r\nbe crucial for overcoming the consequences of \r\nChernobyl, and we call upon all parties concerned to \r\nfurther foster this process.  \r\n Ukraine welcomes the long-standing partnership \r\nwith the IAEA in the implementation of radiological \r\nsupport for the rehabilitation of the Chernobyl-affected \r\nareas. We particularly welcome the efforts of the \r\nAgency to enhance the radiation safety of the local \r\ncommunities in the Chernobyl area, to improve the \r\nlong-term strategy of radiological monitoring and to \r\ndisseminate information.  \r\n During this General Assembly session, we will \r\nsubmit a draft resolution on the strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation to mitigate and minimize the \r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl disaster. We shall look \r\nforward to its adoption by consensus next month. In \r\nthe spirit of solidarity, we kindly invite other Member \r\nStates to join in sponsoring that document.  \r\n Ukraine shares the concerns regarding new \r\nthreats of nuclear terrorism. Therefore, we welcome \r\nthe development of effective measures aimed at \r\npreventing the acquisition by terrorists of nuclear and \r\nradiological weapons and the means of their delivery in \r\nthe framework of initiatives on the suppression of \r\nnuclear terrorism, as well as other international and \r\nregional programmes in this field. At this point, we \r\nnote with satisfaction the entry into force in July 2007 \r\nof the International Convention for the Suppression of \r\nActs of Nuclear Terrorism.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to echo the words of \r\nsupport expressed earlier regarding the report of the \r\nIAEA, and to note again our appreciation for the \r\nactivities of the IAEA Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, \r\nas well as for those of the Agency’s secretariat, in \r\nstrengthening international cooperation in the sphere of \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy. Ukraine will \r\ncontinue to participate actively in the Agency’s \r\nactivities in order to help to fulfil this important \r\nmission.  \r\n Ukraine fully supports the draft resolution \r\nentitled “Report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency” (A/62/L.5). \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nFirst of all, I would like to join other delegations in \r\nthanking Director General Mohamed ElBaradei for his \r\npresentation of the annual report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  \r\n As a member of the IAEA, Kazakhstan takes \r\neffective measures to meet its obligations in \r\nstrengthening the non-proliferation regime, as well as \r\nin implementing the Additional Protocol to its \r\nSafeguards Agreement. By renouncing our possession \r\nof the world’s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal, we again \r\nconfirmed our country’s devotion to implementing its \r\ninternational obligations. We have established and are \r\nconsistently improving a system to combat the illicit \r\ntransfer of nuclear material and technology. At the \r\nsame time, we call for careful reflection on the \r\nintroduction of new limits to the transfer of nuclear \r\ntechnologies so as not to create unjustified barriers to \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear power.  \r\n We in Kazakhstan are working, with IAEA \r\nassistance, to implement the provisions of the new \r\nversion of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and \r\nSecurity of Radioactive Sources.  \r\n In the town of Kurchatov, we have started work \r\non a nuclear technology park, which will be a basis for \r\nthe development of peaceful applications of nuclear \r\npower, including the development of nuclear power in \r\nour country. We have begun operating a heavy ion \r\naccelerator and are continuing the construction of a \r\nKazakh research tokomak. We are also designing a \r\nmajor nuclear medicine centre.  \r\n Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium \r\ndeposits in the world, and we clearly understand the \r\nimportance and responsibility of not using uranium for \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n21 07-57052 \r\n \r\nany purposes other than peaceful ones. This year, \r\nKazakhstan signed an intergovernmental agreement \r\nwith Russia on the creation of an international uranium \r\nenrichment centre in Angarsk. My colleague, the \r\nrepresentative of the Russian Federation, alluded to \r\nthis earlier today (see A/62/PV.36). We believe that the \r\ncreation of a multinational centre for uranium \r\nenrichment would make it possible to ensure reliable \r\nuranium fuel, while at the same time deferring the \r\nproliferation of sensitive technology from the civilian \r\nnuclear fuel cycle. We are an active participant in the \r\nprocess of strengthening the non-proliferation regime, \r\nboth worldwide and in the Central Asian region. \r\n Kazakhstan recognizes the right of each country \r\nto develop peaceful nuclear technology. We must find \r\nways to resolve the conflict situations that have arisen \r\nrecently. These ways should not infringe on the right of \r\ncountries to technological development or their access \r\nto knowledge and should restore the confidence of the \r\ninternational community with regard to peaceful \r\nnuclear activity. This is certainly a very complex task, \r\nbut the experience of the IAEA and of its Director \r\nGeneral with his firm and principled position makes it \r\npossible for us to hope for a successful resolution to \r\nthis problem. \r\n We need to improve the monitoring system \r\nregarding a whole range of problems relating to nuclear \r\nweapons and technology while at the same time \r\nensuring that the nuclear atom is used for exclusively \r\npeaceful purposes, not for military purposes. We feel \r\nthat it is logical to create, under the auspices of the \r\nIAEA, mechanisms, including international centres, to \r\nensure a reliable fuel supply for nuclear power stations \r\nand to manage the secure storage and reprocessing of \r\nwaste at particularly sensitive stages of the fuel cycle. \r\n It is clear that we will need to resolve political, \r\ncommercial and financial questions to do this and it is \r\npossible that such proposals may seem somewhat \r\nunrealistic today, but I think we have to start moving \r\nalong these lines. We do support the IAEA report and \r\nnote the statement made today by the Director General \r\nand his initiative for new approaches to the peaceful \r\nuse of nuclear power. We believe that, once they have \r\nbeen thoroughly discussed, we could agree on general \r\nguidelines for developing innovative nuclear \r\ntechnology. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to express again our \r\nfirm support for the activities of the IAEA, and we \r\nassure you that Kazakhstan will continue to \r\nconsistently live up to its reputation as a responsible \r\ninternational partner in this area. As is our custom, \r\nKazakhstan is one of the sponsors of the resolution to \r\nbe adopted today by the General Assembly on the \r\nIAEA. \r\n Mr. Abdallah (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly and wish him \r\nevery success in his lofty post. We would also like to \r\nexpress our appreciation and thanks to Mr. ElBaradei, \r\nthe Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), for his comprehensive report \r\nto the General Assembly. This report reviews the action \r\nand plans of the IAEA with regard to the transfer of \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, the preservation of \r\nthe international nuclear security regime and the \r\nstrengthening of the security of nuclear installations. \r\nThis stresses the growing role of the IAEA, particularly \r\nin the area of cooperation for the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy and for development. \r\n My delegation welcomes the draft resolution \r\npresented by Chile on the report of the IAEA for 2006. \r\nWe support this draft resolution, in conformity with the \r\nAfrican Group’s position as expressed to the General \r\nAssembly by the representative of Benin. On behalf of \r\nthe delegation of Sudan, it is a great pleasure to \r\nwelcome the representative of Chile and to \r\ncongratulate him on his election as Head of the Board \r\nof Governors. We highly appreciate the efforts of the \r\nIAEA in the area of cooperation with various scientific \r\nbodies to improve agricultural crops and their \r\ncharacteristics, as well as to develop vaccines, a \r\nnuclear medicine programme, particularly in medicines \r\nused in the fight against cancer, one of the deadliest \r\ndiseases of our time. \r\n My delegation reaffirms the right of States, \r\nwithout any discrimination, to undertake research and \r\nproduce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in \r\naccordance with international conventions. We call on \r\nStates to preserve the credibility of the IAEA and its \r\nvital role by refraining from exerting pressure on the \r\nAgency or from interfering with its activities. In this \r\ncontext, we ask that justice and equity be respected in \r\ndealing with certain States, through dialogue and \r\nnegotiations, so as to come to suitable solutions in \r\naccordance with international agreements. \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 22 \r\n \r\n The delegation of the Sudan reaffirms its \r\nestablished position to support the aspirations of all \r\ngeographical regions to make their regions free from \r\nnuclear weapons, on the basis of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which is \r\none of the main pillars of international peace and \r\nsecurity. The Middle East region is still a long way \r\naway from achieving this goal. For decades now, \r\nIsrael, the only State in the region to possess nuclear \r\nweapons, is opposed to such initiatives and refuses to \r\nsign the NPT and its Additional Protocol, despite the \r\nappeals and repeated calls of the international \r\ncommunity to that effect. Israel’s accession to the \r\nTreaty and its Protocol is the only way to put an end to \r\ntensions in the region and to open the path to peace for \r\neveryone. Declaring the Middle East a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone remains the best way to reinforce \r\nregional security and to maintain international peace. \r\n Helping developing countries to develop their \r\nnational legislation will complete the work of the \r\nIAEA in implementing the programmes and plans for \r\ntechnical cooperation. We hope that cooperation will \r\nbe promoted within the framework of the Agency’s \r\nhealth programmes in order to activate and support \r\nregional and continental projects in the fight against \r\nmosquitoes that transmit malaria, the disease that kills \r\nmost people in Africa, so that our continent can \r\nimplement its economic and social development \r\nprogrammes. We highly appreciate the work of the \r\nIAEA on the African continent and we hope that the \r\nAgency’s budget will be increased so that it can fight \r\npoverty and diseases and support nuclear treatment \r\ninstitutions, on the African continent. \r\n The Acting President: We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolution A/62/L.5, but before giving \r\nthe floor to speakers in explanation of vote before the \r\nvote, may I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to ten minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Hong (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is, in \r\nessence, an issue directly linked to the end of the \r\nhostile policy of the United States and its nuclear threat \r\nagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. A \r\npeaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through \r\ndialogue and negotiations is our consistent policy. This \r\nis well proved by our efforts dedicated to the hard \r\nprocess of resolving the issue since the early 1990s. \r\nOur ultimate goal, with regard to the nuclear issue, is \r\nthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. \r\n The 19 September 2005 Joint Statement and the \r\npractical actions taken for its implementation thus far \r\nare a clear indication of the unwavering political will \r\nof the Government of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to realize the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula. The Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea will continue to implement faithfully its \r\nobligations pursuant to the 19 September Joint \r\nStatement on the basis of the principle of actions for \r\nactions. That requires the United States to take political \r\nmeasures such as removing the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea from the list of States sponsors of \r\nterrorism and terminating the obligations of the \r\nTrading with the Enemy Act, as they have pledged to \r\ndo. \r\n In particular, Japan should do positive things to \r\nachieve progress in the ongoing Six-Party Talks, not \r\nmerely in words but in actions. Japan’s call for the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1718 \r\n(2006) is nothing but a manifestation of their ulterior \r\nintentions to block current progress. No issues will be \r\nresolved by sanctions or pressure, as has been proven \r\nby history. \r\n As for the draft resolution before us, with strong \r\nreservations on some paragraphs contained in IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference resolution GC(51)/RES/16, my \r\ndelegation wishes to inform the Assembly that the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea would like to \r\njoin in the consensus adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.5, entitled “Report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency”, with the expectation of continued \r\nprogress in the six-party talks and a fair approach by \r\nthe Agency to the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of position before the Assembly \r\ntakes a decision on the draft resolution. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.5. I should like to announce that, \r\nsince the introduction of the draft resolution, the \r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors of the text: \r\nBelize, Botswana, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, \r\nMoldova, Morocco and Tunisia. \r\n A/62/PV.32\r\n \r\n23 07-57052 \r\n \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.5? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n  Draft resolution A/62/L.5 was adopted \r\n(resolution 62/2). \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Before giving the floor to \r\nthe representative of the Syrian Arab Republic, who \r\nwishes to speak in explanation of position on the \r\nresolution just adopted, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote or position are limited to \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\n Mr. Darwish (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Our delegation joined the consensus on the \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency” (A/62/L.5), guided by its \r\nbelief in the importance of the role of the Agency in \r\nmonitoring nuclear non-proliferation and guaranteeing \r\nthe right of all Member States, big and small alike, to \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy.  \r\n However, our delegation wishes to place on \r\nrecord our disappointment and regret over the double \r\nstandards exhibited by several States in the various \r\nsuccessive conferences of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) on the issue of Israeli nuclear \r\ncapabilities and the Israeli nuclear threat. That has \r\nresulted in the annual postponement of the discussion \r\nof this question, while major international pressure is \r\nbeing brought to bear on other States as they exercise \r\ntheir sovereign right to possess nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes.  \r\n In that regard, we recall that this item has \r\nremained on the agenda of the IAEA General \r\nConference for over a decade, during which time many \r\nresolutions emerged in favour of establishing a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone and calling upon Israel to \r\nabandon the nuclear option, to subject its nuclear \r\nfacilities to international inspection and to the \r\nsafeguards agreement, along with the other States in \r\nthe region, and to strive to establish a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone that has no place for the policies of nuclear \r\nterrorism.  \r\n We should also mention that we were also \r\ndisappointed with the failure of the international \r\ncommunity to send a clear message to Israel, in which \r\nit affirms the importance of good intentions and serious \r\nwork to implement the principle of nuclear non-\r\nproliferation in an equitable and transparent manner, \r\ninstead of the policy of nuclear hypocrisy practiced by \r\nsome States which will only lead to greater threats to \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n Our delegation would like to emphasize that \r\ncontinuous manoeuvring to silence the voice of the \r\ntruth vis-à-vis the Israeli nuclear threat and danger to \r\nthe Middle East will lead to frustration on the part of \r\nthe States and peoples of the region and will cause a \r\nnuclear arms race, the results of which will be the \r\nresponsibility of the States that are covering up the \r\ndanger posed by Israeli nuclear weapons. \r\n The annual vote which is usually held in the First \r\nCommittee on the draft resolution entitled “Threat of \r\nnuclear proliferation in the Middle East” is clear \r\nevidence of the unsound position of those States that \r\nhave mounted obstacles to the discussion of this item at \r\nprevious IAEA General Conferences. That is especially \r\ntrue since the seventh preambular paragraph of this \r\nyear’s First Committee draft resolution (A/C.1/62/L.2) \r\nrefers to concerns about the continued presence of \r\nnuclear facilities in the Middle East that are not subject \r\nto the safeguards regime. The eighth preambular \r\nparagraph of the same draft also notes that Israel \r\nremains the only State in the Middle East that is not yet \r\na party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\n Also, operative paragraphs 2 and 3 of the First \r\nCommittee’s draft resolution emphasize the importance \r\nof Israel joining, without any delay, the NPT, and \r\nhaving all its nuclear facilities subjected to \r\ncomprehensive IAEA safeguards. Israel is urged not to \r\ndevelop, produce, test or possess nuclear weapons, but \r\nto abandon the possession of such weapons as an \r\nimportant confidence-building measure among all \r\nStates in the region and a step towards promoting \r\npeace and security.  \r\n All those demands represent the international and \r\nregional will to protect international and regional peace \r\nand security from the threat of Israeli nuclear arms.  \r\n The Acting President: We have now heard the \r\nonly speaker in explanation of position. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item \r\n87? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nA/62/PV.37 \r\n \r\n07-57052 24 \r\n \r\n \r\nOrganization of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I would like to draw to \r\nthe attention of members that a revised programme of \r\nwork of the General Assembly has been re-issued as \r\ndocument A/INF/62/4/Rev.1, for technical reasons.  \r\n Further to the announcement made at the 33rd \r\nplenary meeting, on 24 October 2007, concerning the \r\nprogramme of work, the following changes are \r\nreflected in the revised version: the postponement to a \r\nlater date of the consideration of agenda item 11, \r\n“Elimination of unilateral extraterritorial coercive \r\neconomic measures as a means of political and \r\neconomic compulsion”; agenda item 14, “Prevention of \r\narmed conflict”; and agenda item 44, “Implementation \r\nof the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and \r\nthe Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS.” The specific \r\nmeeting focused on developments under agenda item \r\n \r\n116, “Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit”, is now scheduled for Thursday afternoon, \r\n6 December 2007. \r\n Additionally, I wish to inform members that on \r\nWednesday afternoon, 31 October 2007, as the second \r\nitem, the General Assembly will take up sub-item (b) \r\nof agenda item 66, “Follow-up to the outcome of the \r\nspecial session on children”, for the purpose of taking \r\naction on a draft decision submitted by the President of \r\nthe General Assembly. The draft decision is entitled \r\n“Participation of children and non-governmental \r\norganizations in the round tables of the \r\nCommemorative High-level Plenary Meeting Devoted \r\nto the Follow-up to the Outcome of the Special Session \r\non Children”. This will be issued under the symbol \r\nA/62/L.8. \r\n \r\nThe meeting rose at 5.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
