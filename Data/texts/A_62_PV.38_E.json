(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 21  \r\n \r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/92 and \r\nA/62/92/Add.1) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.1) \r\n \r\n Mr. Amil (Pakistan): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China \r\nunder the agenda item entitled, “Necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against \r\nCuba”.  \r\n The heads of State and Government of the Group \r\nof 77 and China at the second South Summit, held in \r\nQatar in June 2005, condemned the use of economic \r\ncoercive measures designed to prevent countries from \r\nexercising their right to decide their own political, \r\neconomic and social systems and called on all \r\ncountries not to recognize unilateral extraterritorial \r\nlaws that impose sanctions on other States and foreign \r\ncompanies. The heads of State and Government also \r\nrecognized that the embargo had caused a high degree \r\nof economic and financial damage and had negatively \r\nimpacted on the welfare and well-being of the people \r\nof Cuba. They called upon the Government of the \r\nUnited States to put an end to the embargo. \r\n More recently, at the thirty-first Annual \r\nMinisterial Meeting of the Group of 77 and China, held \r\nin New York on 27 September 2007, the Ministers once \r\nagain firmly rejected the imposition of laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all other \r\nforms of coercive economic measures, including \r\nunilateral sanctions against developing countries. The \r\nministers reiterated the urgent need to eliminate them \r\nimmediately. They emphasized that such actions not \r\nonly undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law, but also \r\nseverely threaten the freedom of trade and investment. \r\nThey therefore called on the international community \r\nto neither recognize those measures nor apply them. \r\nThe G-77 and China stands firm in rejecting unilateral \r\nmeasures as a means of exerting pressure on \r\ndeveloping countries.  \r\n The G-77 and China is committed to working \r\ntowards a better world for all in which nations large or \r\nsmall can coexist peacefully. The achievement of such \r\npeaceful coexistence among nations requires an \r\nadherence by all nations to the rule of law, including \r\ninternational law.  \r\n In conformity with the fundamental norms of \r\ninternational law, international humanitarian law, the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the norms and \r\nprinciples governing peaceful relations among States, \r\nthe G-77 and China supports the need to eliminate \r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political \r\nand economic coercion.  \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 2 \r\n \r\n The Group of 77 and China believes that the \r\ncontinued imposition of an economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba violates the principles \r\nof the sovereign equality of States and of \r\nnon-intervention and non-interference in other States’ \r\ndomestic affairs, as well as international humanitarian \r\nlaw, the Charter of the United Nations and the norms \r\nand principles governing peaceful relations among \r\nStates.  \r\n We believe that the replacement of the embargo \r\nwith greater dialogue and cooperation will contribute \r\ngreatly not only towards the removal of tensions, but \r\nalso towards promoting meaningful exchange and \r\npartnership between countries whose destinies are \r\nlinked by history and geography.  \r\n Considering the impact that the embargo has had \r\non the everyday life of the Cuban people, the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States are here \r\ntoday in support of the resolution on the necessity of \r\nending the embargo. The G-77 and China will again \r\nsupport the draft resolution (A/62/L.1) before us today \r\nand would urge all Member States to do so as well. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the honour to \r\nspeak regarding agenda item 21 on behalf of the \r\n118 United Nations Member States that are members of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).  \r\n The Movement renews its commitment to defend, \r\npreserve and promote the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law. We oppose unilateralism and \r\nunilaterally imposed measures by States in violation of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law. \r\nNAM rejects the adoption and implementation of \r\nextraterritorial or unilateral coercive measures or \r\nlegislation, including unilateral economic sanctions, \r\nother intimidating measures and arbitrary travel \r\nrestrictions, that seek to exert pressure on non-aligned \r\ncountries; threaten their sovereignty, independence and \r\nfreedom of trade and investment; and prevent them \r\nfrom exercising their right to decide, of their own free \r\nwill, their own political, economic and social systems.  \r\n Those measures, laws and regulations constitute \r\nflagrant violations of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, international law, the multilateral trading \r\nsystem and the norms and principles governing \r\nfriendly relations among States. In this context, we are \r\ncommitted to persevere with effective efforts to reverse \r\nthem and urge other States to do likewise, as called for \r\nby the General Assembly and other United Nations \r\norgans. NAM requests that States applying those \r\nmeasures or laws revoke them fully and immediately.  \r\n As reaffirmed by the heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Non-Aligned Movement at their \r\nSummit Conference held in Havana in September \r\n2006, we call once again upon the Government of the \r\nUnited States of America to put an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba, which, in addition to being unilateral and \r\ncontrary to the Charter of the United Nations, \r\ninternational law and the principle of good \r\nneighbourliness, is causing huge material losses and \r\neconomic damage to the people of Cuba.  \r\n NAM reiterates its deep concern over the \r\nwidening of the extraterritorial nature of the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba and rejects the reinforcement of the \r\nmeasures adopted by the United States Government \r\naimed at tightening the embargo, as well as all other \r\nrecent measures carried out by the Government of the \r\nUnited States against the people of Cuba.  \r\n In conclusion, the Non-Aligned Movement again \r\nurges strict compliance with resolutions 47/19, 48/16, \r\n49/9, 50/10, 51/17, 52/10, 53/4, 54/21, 55/20, 56/9, \r\n57/11, 58/7, 59/11, 60/12 and 61/11 of the United \r\nNations General Assembly, all related to the necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n The President: Before giving the floor to the \r\nnext speaker, I would like to propose that the list of \r\nspeakers in the debate on this item be now closed.  \r\n It was so decided. \r\n Ms. Bethel (Bahamas): I have the honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the member \r\nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), \r\nnamely Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, \r\nDominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, \r\nSt. Kitzenibez, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and my \r\nown country, the Bahamas.  \r\n Let me begin by stating that CARICOM aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by Pakistan on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China.  \r\n The situation affecting the Caribbean member \r\nState of Cuba continues to be of significant concern to \r\nthe Caribbean Community in the context of \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n3 07-57058 \r\n \r\ncontemporary international relations. CARICOM has \r\nalways recognized the importance of productive and \r\nmutually beneficial relations among the countries of \r\nthe wider Caribbean, whose shores are washed by the \r\nCaribbean Sea and which must face the challenges to \r\nglobalization from a unified perspective. Thus Cuba, as \r\na sister Caribbean State, faces certain obstacles that \r\ncontinue to be of great concern to our wider region. At \r\nthe second meeting of CARICOM-Cuba on 29 May in \r\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Ministers for \r\nForeign Affairs, in the communiqué issuing therefrom, \r\nreiterated: \r\n “their firm commitment to the purpose and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, multilateralism and the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law, including respect \r\nfor sovereignty and the juridical equality of \r\nStates, and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof States, the prohibition of threats or the use of \r\nforce in international relations, respect for \r\nterritorial integrity, the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes and the sovereign rights of the citizens \r\nof every country to freely determine its system \r\nand political institutions in conditions of peace, \r\nstability and justice.”  \r\nThose principles continue to constitute core elements \r\nin the conduct of CARICOM international relations.  \r\n In that regard, we read with great interest the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General, which outlines the \r\nmany responses from an overwhelming majority of \r\nMember States, who also share and uphold those \r\nprinciples as they relate to the unilateral embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. CARICOM reiterates its complete \r\nopposition to the punitive embargo, which has gone on \r\nfor far too long. We maintain our opposition to the \r\nimposition of extraterritorial laws on third States, \r\nwhich is contrary to the Charter and has no place in \r\ncontemporary international relations. \r\n The significant impact of the embargo on the \r\nCuban economy continues to be of great concern to \r\nCARICOM, and the humanitarian impact on the people \r\nof Cuba, especially in the area of health care and food, \r\nis indeed saddening. The inability of Cuba to acquire \r\nmedical equipment, spare parts and latest-generation \r\nmedications because of the embargo continues to affect \r\nthe Cuban health-care system, where treatment \r\nnonetheless remains free of charge to the Cuban \r\npeople. \r\n Cuba, as the most populous State of the \r\nCaribbean region, is an integral part of our pan-\r\nCaribbean process. CARICOM links with Cuba remain \r\nstrong and are continually expanding. On 8 December \r\n2006, the Chairman of the CARICOM Conference of \r\nHeads of Government, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas \r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis, recounted the historical links \r\nbetween Cuba and CARICOM States on the occasion \r\nof the 34th anniversary of the establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between Cuba and CARICOM. On \r\nthat day, in 1972, the four independent Caribbean \r\nStates of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and \r\nTobago expressed their strong commitment to the \r\nconcept of the oneness of the Caribbean. Since that \r\ntime, the relationship has been one of solidarity and \r\nfraternity and has become stronger and deeper through \r\ncooperation in the political, economic and social \r\ndomains.  \r\n Prime Minister Douglas also expressed the deep \r\nappreciation of CARICOM for the technical and other \r\nforms of assistance that Cuba continues to provide to \r\nthe Caribbean, particularly to the young people of our \r\nregion as they seek to develop their professional skills \r\nand contribute to the building of our nations and, \r\ncollectively, to the Caribbean community.  \r\n The Prime Minister went on to acknowledge that \r\nalmost 3,000 CARICOM students are currently \r\nstudying in Cuba, a large number of whom are \r\nbeneficiaries of scholarships in disciplines ranging \r\nfrom medicine, engineering and telecommunications to \r\narchitecture, computer sciences, geology and others. \r\nCuban scholarships to the non-self-governing \r\nTerritories of the Caribbean must also be recognized \r\nand applauded.  \r\n It is no small feat that Cuban assistance in the \r\nfield of health throughout much of the globe continues \r\nto be considerable, even as the impact of the embargo \r\nis systematically tightened. Cuban doctors continue to \r\nserve throughout the developing world, where health-\r\ncare needs are often acute and greatly underserviced. In \r\nthe Caribbean alone, Cuba has built hospitals and \r\nclinics, provided medicines and furnished doctors, \r\nnurses and other health-care professionals. Cuban \r\nsupport for the restoration of the sight of many of our \r\npeople will always be remembered with utmost \r\nappreciation and gratitude.  \r\n The meeting of CARICOM/Cuba ministers for \r\nforeign affairs last May identified additional areas of \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 4 \r\n \r\ncooperation, including the fight against the HIV/AIDS \r\npandemic, cooperation on the impact of climate change \r\nbetween the Caribbean Community Climate Change \r\nCentre and the Cuban Institute of Meteorology, and the \r\nsustainable use of natural resources, among others. We \r\nin CARICOM are looking forward to further \r\ncooperation with Cuba on all of those matters. \r\n Through its actions, Cuba has shown that it is an \r\nintegral part of the Caribbean. It has not threatened any \r\nMember State, but rather has consistently sought to \r\nassist its neighbours in their ongoing quest for \r\nsustainable human development. CARICOM reiterates \r\nits unwavering support for the right of the Cuban \r\npeople, and all people, to self-determination, as clearly \r\nstated in the Charter of the United Nations.  \r\n The embargo imposed against Cuba is an \r\nanachronism and serves no useful purpose in this \r\ntwenty-first century, where our planet is faced with the \r\nformidable challenge of an impending Earth crisis as a \r\nresult of climate change. While small island States in \r\nthe Caribbean and Pacific provide early warning of \r\nimminent climactic disaster, large areas of the African \r\ncontinent are now suffering through drought on the one \r\nhand and disastrous floods on the other. Economic \r\ninequality continues to persist and worsen. We must \r\nexert all the energies of the international community to \r\nface and resolve those formidable challenges.  \r\n CARICOM enjoys friendly relations with both \r\nCuba and the United States. Those two great nations \r\nhave produced great scholars, scientists and global \r\nleaders. We call for a new beginning between the \r\nGovernments and peoples of those two great nations, \r\none large, one small. As with similar initiatives \r\nundertaken for negotiations on far more difficult issues \r\nof international relations, we can only imagine the \r\nresounding positive effect for the international \r\ncommunity of such a rapprochement, based on the \r\nfundamental principle of the self-determination of \r\npeoples.  \r\n It is within that context that CARICOM States \r\nsupport the draft resolution on the necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba \r\n(A/62/L.1). The time has long passed for us to move on \r\nand to tackle the real challenges facing humankind. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jorge Valero, Vice-Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela. \r\n Mr. Valero (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): The economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the Government of the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba constitutes a \r\ngenocidal and unilateral act of criminal force, which \r\nflagrantly violates the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the norms and principles of international law.  \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\ncategorically rejects the application of laws or \r\nregulatory provisions with extraterritorial effect that \r\nviolate the sovereignty of States and intervene in their \r\ninternal affairs. The embargo against Cuba is an \r\nanachronism of failed imperial policies and is rejected \r\nby the overwhelming majority of the peoples and \r\nGovernments of the world. The United Nations has \r\nrepeatedly rejected the embargo and the forces of \r\nNorth American imperialism have repeatedly \r\ndisregarded that appeal by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n A few days ago, President George W. Bush \r\nthreatened to intensify the ferocity of the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, urged further isolation of that heroic \r\nbrotherly country and called for the undermining of the \r\ninstitutions of the Cuban State. That represents a new \r\nattempt to destroy the revolution and reconquer Cuba, \r\nand it is now being implemented. The Bolivarian \r\nrevolution completely rejects those irrational \r\nendeavours and urges all Governments and peoples of \r\nthe world to oppose such imperial arrogance.  \r\n The inhuman measures imposed by the \r\nGovernment of United States of America for more than \r\n45 years have had a terrible economic and social \r\nimpact on the sister Republic of Cuba, in refusing to \r\nrecognize the norms that govern economic, commercial \r\nand financial relations among States. The Government \r\nand the people of Cuba have responded with honour \r\nand dignity to this criminal aggression. Despite the \r\nembargo, Cuba maintains its cooperation and solidarity \r\nwith the peoples of the South, in particular with regard \r\nto programmes in education and health care. Venezuela \r\nappreciates the solidarity of the Cuban people and of \r\nits historic leader, Commander Fidel Castro. \r\n Venezuela firmly demands that the Government \r\nof the United States put an end to the cruel and \r\npunitive embargo against Cuba. The human rights of \r\nthe Cuban people are being massively, flagrantly and \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n5 07-57058 \r\n \r\nrepeatedly violated by that genocidal act. The embargo \r\nagainst Cuba constitutes an act of aggression and \r\nhinders the necessary climate of dialogue and \r\ncooperation that must prevail among sovereign States \r\nin the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and in \r\nline with its purposes and principles.  \r\n Allow me to recall here a quote by Cornelius \r\nTacitus that is a perfect description of the haughtiness \r\nof today’s imperialists. The great Roman philosopher \r\nand historian said: “Where they make a desert, they \r\ncall it peace”. Those who insult and destroy peoples \r\nand cultures in the name of freedom operate in the \r\nsame manner.  \r\n This Assembly has rejected the unilateral \r\nimposition of measures by the Government of the \r\nUnited States against Cuba. It is high time to reiterate \r\nthat determination. In this framework, our country \r\nsubscribes to the statements made by the representative \r\nof Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and \r\nby the representative of Uruguay on behalf of the \r\nCommon Market of the South and its associated States.  \r\n Venezuela will vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.1 on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba.  \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGovernment of Mexico once more expresses its \r\nrejection of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba, and reiterates its opposition to \r\nthe use of coercive measures that are not supported by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Mexico states that \r\nany type of political, economic or military sanctions \r\nimposed upon States can only derive from the \r\ndecisions or recommendations of the Security Council \r\nor General Assembly. The Government of Mexico has \r\nmaintained that position in the context of various \r\nUnited Nations agencies, supported by the fact that the \r\nUnited States embargo against Cuba is the result of a \r\nunilateral policy that has dragged on for almost half a \r\ncentury in contravention of international law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.  \r\n Mexico believes, furthermore, that such unilateral \r\nmeasures result in severe humanitarian \r\nconsequences — in direct contradiction to the \r\nobjectives that supposedly inspired those measures — \r\nand represent a rejection of diplomacy and dialogue as \r\nthe ideal ways to settle disputes among States.  \r\n As stated in the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/62/92), various organs and entities of the United \r\nNations system have noted the embargo’s negative \r\nimpact on the economic and social development of \r\nCuba. Some of those consequences include the effect \r\non foreign banks’ transactions with Cuba in United \r\nStates dollars and on Cuban assets worldwide; \r\nretaliatory measures taken against foreign companies’ \r\ninvestment operations in Cuba, limiting the options for \r\nattracting foreign investment to those companies that \r\nhave no commercial interests in the United States; \r\nobstacles to the integration of Cuba into the global \r\ntrading system, with consequent negative effects on \r\ngross domestic product growth, on export income and \r\non industrial and agricultural production; limitations on \r\nCuban access to development loans granted by \r\ninternational financial institutions such as the World \r\nBank and the Inter-American Development Bank; \r\ndifficulties in obtaining the necessary resources and \r\nsupplies for cooperative education and health \r\nprogrammes in Cuba as well as external financing for \r\nagricultural and rural development programmes; and, \r\nmore generally, effects that have repercussions for \r\nthird countries because they cannot interact \r\neconomically, academically and socially with Cuba.  \r\n The Government of Mexico maintains its bilateral \r\nand multilateral relations on the basis of the general \r\nprinciples of international law that govern peaceful and \r\ncivilized coexistence among sovereign States. Such \r\nprinciples have been upheld with consistency and \r\nperseverance over time in the relationship between \r\nMexico and Cuba.  \r\n Thus, since 1992, when the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba first submitted to the Assembly a \r\ndraft resolution on ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the Government of \r\nthe United States of America, Mexico has voted in \r\nfavour of the resolutions adopted by the General \r\nAssembly on this subject. My Government has \r\ndemonstrated to the international community its firm \r\nopposition to the extraterritorial application of national \r\nlaws in other countries in violation of international law. \r\nFor 16 years, Mexico has stated that the embargo must \r\nend and has supported the inclusion of Cuba in all \r\nregional integration mechanisms in order to foster \r\neconomic and commercial exchange and cooperation \r\nfor development.  \r\n Mexico believes that the observance of \r\ninternational law and the norms and principles that \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 6 \r\n \r\ngovern coexistence among nations, and respectful \r\ndialogue, irrespective of differences and inequalities, \r\nare necessary instruments for overcoming differences \r\nbetween States and guaranteeing international peace. \r\nSocieties evolve and change in line with their own \r\ncircumstances, and not as a result of externally \r\nimposed mechanisms.  \r\n For the aforementioned reasons, Mexico will \r\nsupport the draft resolution (A/62/L.1) that has been \r\nsubmitted at this session on this subject. \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): My \r\ndelegation thanks the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/62/92) on the implementation of resolution 61/11, \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. The \r\nVietnamese delegation fully associates itself with the \r\nstatements by the representatives of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the Group of 77 and China on this \r\nimportant agenda item. \r\n My delegation welcomes the presence of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, at our deliberations today. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against the \r\nRepublic of Cuba for almost half a century has caused \r\nhuge economic damage and untold suffering for the \r\nCuban people. It has severely hindered their economic \r\nand social development and undermined their \r\nendeavours to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Direct economic damages caused by the \r\nembargo to the Cuban people exceed $89 billion over \r\nalmost 50 years; last year’s damages to Cuba’s foreign \r\ntrade alone amounted to over $1.4 billion.  \r\n My delegation expresses its serious concern \r\nregarding the fact that this long-standing embargo has \r\nnot only remained intact, but has also been tightened, \r\nwith the enforcement of laws and provisions of a \r\ndistinctly extraterritorial character. Viet Nam holds that \r\nthis embargo, the longest in history, runs counter to the \r\nfundamental principles of international law, the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the regulations of the World \r\nTrade Organization. The prolongation of such coercive \r\neconomic measures will only cause further tension in \r\nthe bilateral relations between the United States and \r\nCuba and more hardship and difficulties for the Cuban \r\npeople, especially those most vulnerable, such as \r\nwomen and children.  \r\n It is thus a surprise to no one that the embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba \r\nhas been repeatedly rejected by a growing number of \r\nMember States, to the point where the opposition has \r\nbecome almost unanimous. Today, the presence of such \r\na large number of Member States and their active \r\nparticipation in these deliberations are strong evidence \r\nof their opposition to these unilateral extraterritorial \r\nmeasures. \r\n Every nation has the inalienable right to \r\ndetermine its own political system and the path of \r\ndevelopment suitable to its specific conditions. Viet \r\nNam is convinced that the differences between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba should be settled through \r\ndialogue and negotiations on the basis of mutual \r\nrespect, respect for each other’s independence and \r\nsovereignty and non-interference in each other’s \r\ninternal affairs. We believe that the normalization and \r\ndevelopment of friendly relations between the two \r\ngeographically close neighbours will serve the interests \r\nof their peoples and those of regional and international \r\npeace and security. In that spirit, my delegation calls \r\nupon the United States of America to put an immediate \r\nend to its policy of economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against the Republic of Cuba. \r\n Finally, my delegation wishes to reaffirm our \r\ncountry’s sentiments of friendship and solidarity with \r\nthe Cuban people. The Vietnamese Government and \r\npeople will continue to do our utmost to assist the \r\nGovernment and the peace-loving people of Cuba in \r\novercoming the effects of the embargo. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Felipe Peréz Roque, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.1. \r\n Mr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba — and \r\nagainst the rights of the peoples represented in this \r\nAssembly — has already lasted for nearly half a \r\ncentury. \r\n According to conservative estimates, it has \r\ncaused losses to Cuba of more than $89 billion. At the \r\nUnited States dollar’s current value, that accounts to no \r\nless than $222 billion. Everyone can understand the \r\nlevel of socio-economic development that Cuba would \r\nhave attained had it not been subjected to this \r\nunrelenting and obsessive economic war. The embargo \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n7 07-57058 \r\n \r\nis today the main obstacle to the development and \r\nwell-being of the Cubans and a flagrant, massive and \r\nsystematic violation of the rights of our people. \r\n The embargo attempts to subdue the Cuban \r\npeople through starvation and disease. That is how the \r\nessence of the embargo on Cuba was explained at a \r\nmeeting led by President Dwight Eisenhower in \r\n1960 — the following is a quote from the document \r\nbefore that meeting, which was subsequently \r\ndeclassified in the 1990s: \r\n  “There is no effective political opposition in \r\nCuba .... The only predictable measure we have \r\ntoday to alienate internal support for the \r\nrevolution is through disillusionment and \r\ndesperation, based on dissatisfaction and \r\neconomic duress. Every possible means should be \r\nundertaken promptly to weaken the economic life \r\nof Cuba. Money and supplies must be denied to \r\nCuba in order to decrease real wages, bring about \r\nhunger, desperation and the overthrow of \r\ngovernment.” \r\n Forty-seven years later, President George W. \r\nBush repeated it in these words: “I also urge our \r\nCongress to show our support and solidarity for \r\nfundamental change in Cuba by maintaining our \r\nembargo”. \r\n Seven in every ten Cubans have only ever known \r\nthe perennial threat of aggression against our homeland \r\nand the economic hardships caused by the relentless \r\npersecution of the embargo. \r\n The United States has ignored, with arrogance \r\nand political blindness, the 15 resolutions adopted by \r\nthe General Assembly calling for the lifting of the \r\nembargo against Cuba. What is more, over the past \r\nyear, they have adopted new measures bordering on \r\nmadness and fanaticism, which further tighten the \r\nsanctions and the extraterritorial persecution of our \r\nrelations with the countries represented in this \r\nAssembly. \r\n The embargo had never been enforced with such \r\nviciousness as over the past year. On 14 August 2006, \r\nthe Government of the United States went as far as to \r\npenalizing the Alliance of Baptists, claiming that some \r\nof its faithful engaged in tourism during a visit to Cuba \r\nfor religious purposes. In December 2006, the \r\nGovernment of the United States prevented American \r\ncompanies from providing Internet services to Cuba. \r\nAs a result, in Cuba, if one tries to access Google \r\nEarth, as do millions of users around the world every \r\nday, one gets the following response: “This service is \r\nnot available in your country.” \r\n Cuban children have been particularly harmed by \r\nthe embargo that President Bush has promised to \r\nstrengthen. Cuban children do not have the use of \r\nSevorane, an inhaled anaesthetic manufactured by the \r\nNorth American company Abbott, and the best \r\npaediatric general anaesthesia. We must use lower-\r\nquality substitutes. President Bush will undoubtedly \r\nexplain that by saying that those Cuban children are \r\ncollateral victims of his war against Cuba. \r\n Cuban children suffering from arrhythmia can no \r\nlonger receive the pacemakers that the American \r\ncompany Saint Jude Medical once sold us. Saint Jude \r\nMedical was forced to stop doing business with Cuba \r\ndue to the extreme pressure exerted by the Office for \r\nForeign Assets Control. The United States delegation \r\nshould explain to the Assembly why Cuban children \r\nsuffering from cardiac arrhythmia are enemies of the \r\nUnited States Government. The Cuban delegation \r\ncannot explain it. Perhaps the United States delegation \r\ncould, as culture has been one of the main targets in \r\nprosecuting the blockade. \r\n The Government of the United States prevents \r\nCuba from participating in the Puerto Rico \r\nInternational Book Fair. Blocking the participation of \r\nCuban writers and publishers in a book fair is a \r\nbarbaric act. \r\n Beginning in December 2006, hotels belonging to \r\nthe American chains Ritz-Carlton, Hilton and Marriott \r\nreceived instructions from the United States \r\nGovernment to cancel contracts with Cuban musicians \r\nworking temporarily in their hotels throughout the \r\nworld. Only if they move to Miami, declare their \r\nadmiration for President Bush’s policies and regret \r\never having lived in Cuba will they be able to be hired \r\nagain. \r\n Today, I would like to reiterate our solidarity with \r\nAmerican filmmakers Oliver Stone and Michael \r\nMoore. Mr. Stone has been fined by the United States \r\nGovernment, in the name of freedom, for travelling to \r\nCuba to shoot the documentaries Comandante and \r\nLooking for Fidel. I really do not know how President \r\nBush thought that Oliver Stone could find Fidel unless \r\nhe travelled to Cuba. Michael Moore is being \r\ninvestigated for the trip that he made to our country \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 8 \r\n \r\nlast March to shoot his documentary Sicko. This is \r\ntwenty-first century McCarthyism. \r\n With that grotesque persecution of the honest \r\nword and independent art, the President of the United \r\nStates is emulating the Inquisition of the Middle Ages. \r\nThe difference is that this modern-day Inquisition is \r\nmuch more barbaric and lethal. For it organized the \r\nlooting of the fabulous Baghdad Library and the \r\nburning of over 1 million volumes. \r\n I should now like to recall the words expressed \r\nby international Cuban artist Alicia Alonso in a recent \r\nletter to American intellectuals and artists: \r\n “Let us work together so that Cuban artists and \r\nwriters can take their talent to the United States, \r\nand for you not to be prevented from coming to \r\nour island to share your knowledge and values — \r\nfor a song, a book, a scientific study or a \r\nperformance not to be irrationally considered a \r\ncrime”. \r\n The blockade persecutes human exchanges and \r\nrelations between the peoples of Cuba and the United \r\nStates. It also prevents normal relations between Cuban \r\nfamilies on both sides of the Florida Strait. Fines of up \r\nto $1 million for companies and $250,000 for \r\nindividuals, as well as prison sentences of up to \r\n10 years for offenders, is the price to be risked by an \r\nAmerican visiting our country as a tourist or by a \r\nCuban residing in the United States who wants to visit \r\na sick relative in Cuba. \r\n On more than one occasion, the Assembly has \r\nheard the representatives of the United States say that \r\nthe issue that we are now debating is a bilateral matter \r\nthat should not be dealt with by this forum. They will \r\nlikely repeat that fallacious argument later when they \r\nexplain their vote. However, as members of the \r\nAssembly are well aware, the brutal economic war \r\nimposed on Cuba affects not only Cubans. If that alone \r\nwere the case, it would be an extremely serious \r\nsituation. But it is even worse: it is an affront to \r\ninternational law, the purposes and principles enshrined \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations, and the right of \r\nevery country to engage in free and sovereign trade \r\nwith whomever it chooses. \r\n The extraterritorial enforcement of American \r\nlaws, in disregard of the legitimate interests of third \r\ncountries — the same countries represented by those \r\npresent in the Hall — to invest and develop normal \r\neconomic and trade relations with Cuba is an issue that \r\nconcerns all States gathered here. In the period \r\nspanning May 2006 to May 2007 alone, at least \r\n30 countries were affected by the extraterritorial \r\nprovisions of the blockade policy against Cuba. Let us \r\nlook at just a few examples. \r\n On 28 July 2006, the Netherlands Caribbean \r\nBank of the Netherlands Antilles experienced the \r\nenforcement of blockade regulations. That included the \r\nfreezing of accounts from this bank held in the United \r\nStates and a prohibition from carrying out any \r\ntransactions involving American citizens or entities. \r\n On 4 May 2007, the British company PSL Energy \r\nServices was fined $164,000 for exporting oil industry \r\nequipment and services to Cuba. \r\n Sabroe compressors could also not be exported to \r\nCuba, once the Danish company that manufactures \r\nthem was acquired by an American corporation. \r\n The United States multinational General Electric \r\ntook over the Finnish company Datex-Ohmeda. Up \r\nuntil the day of the takeover Cuba was able to continue \r\nto purchase its excellent Finnish-made anaesthesia and \r\nmultipurpose monitoring equipment as usual. \r\n When Cuba’s Institute for Food Nutrition and \r\nHygiene tried to buy an infrared spectrophotometer \r\nfrom the Japanese company Shimadzu, it discovered \r\nthat it was forbidden to do so under the blockade \r\nbecause more than 10 per cent of its components were \r\nof American origin. \r\n The German company BASF AG could not sell a \r\nherbicide to Cuba, neither from Germany nor from its \r\nsubsidiaries in Latin America, because the active \r\ningredient it contains is of American origin. \r\n Since late 2006, when the Spanish cruise ship \r\ncompany Pullmantur was acquired by the American \r\ncompany Royal Caribbean, the cruise ship Holiday \r\nDream, which is owned by Pullmantur, has had to \r\nsuspend its operations in Cuba. \r\n In December 2006, the management of Norway’s \r\nScandic Hotel, which had been bought in March 2006 \r\nby the American hotel chain Hilton, cancelled the \r\nreservations of a Cuban delegation that was to attend \r\nan international tourism trade show. That caused great \r\nscandal and was widely rejected by Norwegian public \r\nopinion. However, the most incredible thing was yet to \r\nhappen. Hilton Group’s spokeswoman in London made \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n9 07-57058 \r\n \r\na public announcement — and I urge representatives to \r\nlisten clearly — that the chain would bar bookings by \r\nCubans in all its hotels around the world, because \r\notherwise it would be subject to fines, or even prison \r\nsentences, under the laws of the blockade. \r\n However, undoubtedly the most notorious \r\nepisode to take place this year vis-à-vis the United \r\nStates blockade against Cuba was the pitched battle \r\nwaged by the United States Treasury Department \r\nagainst Cuba’s relations with third-country financial \r\nand banking institutions. That was especially possible \r\nafter the United States Government and its special \r\nservices gained access to the confidential information \r\nheld by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial \r\nTelecommunication (SWIFT). It is through that body \r\nthat nearly all payments and message exchanges are \r\ntransacted by financial institutions around the world. \r\n In the past year, more than 20 banks from various \r\ncountries have been grossly threatened in order to \r\ndisrupt any kind of relations or transactions with Cuba. \r\nFor understandable reasons, I cannot give the \r\nAssembly more information on such a sensitive issue, \r\nas that would facilitate the obsessive persecution on the \r\npart of American agencies that are entirely devoted to \r\nthis ignoble task. \r\n Just a few days ago, the President of the United \r\nStates said that the Cuban regime uses the United \r\nStates embargo as a scapegoat for all of Cuba’s \r\nmiseries. However, based on information provided by \r\n118 countries and 21 international organizations, the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General contained in document \r\nA/62/92 clearly and thoroughly confirms the actions \r\nundertaken by the United States Administration in the \r\ncourse of the past year to strengthen the blockade and \r\nintensify its serious consequences for Cuba. \r\n The General Assembly has an opportunity today \r\nto freely and openly voice the opinion of the \r\ninternational community on the policy of blockade and \r\naggression that the United States has imposed on \r\nCubans for nearly 50 years. At this very moment, back \r\nin Cuba our people are following with both attention \r\nand hope the decision that members of the Assembly \r\nwill take. They do so recalling the words of Fidel: \r\n“Never had a nation such sacred things to defend nor \r\nsuch profound convictions for which to fight”. \r\n Cuba will not surrender. It fights and will \r\ncontinue to fight, with the conviction that defending \r\nour rights today is tantamount to defending the rights \r\nof all the peoples represented in the Assembly. On \r\nbehalf of Cuba, I ask representatives to vote in favour \r\nof the draft resolution entitled “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. I ask \r\nthe Assembly to do so in defiance of the lies and \r\nthreats made in recent days. We ask that you vote in \r\nfavour of Cuba’s draft resolution, as a vote in favour is \r\nalso a vote in favour of all the peoples of the world.  \r\n I shall conclude by recalling the words by José \r\nMartí, apostle of Cuba’s independence: “He who rises \r\nwith Cuba today will be rising for all time to come”. \r\nFreedom for the five Cuban heroes, fighters against \r\nterrorism and political prisoners, in American jails! \r\nFreedom for the five Cuban heroes! I do indeed have a \r\nlegitimate right to say “Viva Cuba libre! Viva Cuba \r\nLibre! Viva Cuba libre!” \r\n Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): Let me begin by \r\nwelcoming the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, \r\nwhose presence at this debate is an indication of the \r\nimportance we all attach to this issue. \r\n As we have just heard, for more than 47 years the \r\npeople of Cuba have lived under a unilateral economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on them by \r\ntheir neighbour, the United States of America. That \r\nmeans that the majority Cuban citizens have known no \r\nother life than a life under coercive measures. But, \r\ndespite everything, the Cuban people have survived. \r\n That long-standing economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo has been consistently rejected by a \r\ngrowing number of Member States of the United \r\nNations, to a point where their opposition has become \r\nalmost unanimous. Throughout the embargo, the Cuban \r\npeople have extended a hand of friendship and \r\nsolidarity to other peoples around the world. For \r\ninstance, it is not unusual to find Cuban doctors and \r\nnurses in many parts of Latin America and Africa. \r\nCuba’s outstanding work in the areas of health, \r\neducation and biotechnology in many developing \r\ncountries, and throughout the world in general, is \r\nrecognized by the international community. The \r\nembargo that was designed to stifle the everyday lives \r\nof the Cuban people has instead produced a \r\ncontribution by Cuba to the betterment of the lives of \r\nother peoples around the world. \r\n Cuba’s contribution has also included supporting \r\nstruggles for freedom and justice around the world. For \r\nexample, in South Africa we recognized Cuba’s \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 10 \r\n \r\ncontribution to our own freedom and democracy. The \r\nWall of Remembrance of our heroes of the struggle \r\nagainst apartheid lists a number of Cuban fighters who \r\nfought alongside our freedom fighters, and even gave \r\ntheir lives to see South Africa free. Today, we \r\nremember and honour those heroes, who succeeded in \r\nspite of the embargo aimed at their everyday lives. \r\n South Africa has consistently opposed all aspects \r\nof the embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba, for more fundamental reasons \r\nthat go beyond the solidarity we share with the Cuban \r\npeople. South Africa views the continued imposition of \r\nan economic, commercial and financial embargo as a \r\nviolation of the principles of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates and of non-intervention and non-interference in \r\neach other’s domestic affairs. South Africa has \r\ntherefore repeatedly joined the vast majority of \r\ncountries in expressing its disagreement with, and \r\nopposition to, all aspects of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. \r\n We are guided by the basic norms of international \r\nlaw and conduct and our principled support for the \r\nneed to eliminate coercive economic measures as a \r\nmeans of achieving political and economic goals. \r\nSouth Africa believes that constructive dialogue can \r\nfoster mutual trust and understanding, as well as \r\nengender harmony and peaceful coexistence among \r\nnations. \r\n South Africa is committed to working towards a \r\nbetter world for all, including the Cuban people, in \r\nwhich nations coexist peacefully, no matter how large \r\nor small. The achievement of such peaceful \r\ncoexistence among nations requires adherence by all \r\nnations to the rule of law, including international law. \r\n My delegation believes that the presence of such \r\na large number of Member States in this Hall today, \r\nand their participation in these deliberations, is an \r\nindication of their opposition to unilateral \r\nextraterritorial measures. We are here to express our \r\nfirm opposition to coercive economic measures as a \r\nmeans of exerting pressure on developing countries, as \r\nsuch measures are contrary to international law, \r\ninternational humanitarian law, the United Nations \r\nCharter and the norms and principles governing \r\npeaceful relations among States. \r\n South Africa will join the majority in the \r\nAssembly in supporting the draft resolution before us \r\ntoday. We will vote yes because this relentless and \r\nunilateral action has caused untold suffering to the \r\npeople of Cuba. We believe that the overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States present today will join us in \r\nvoting yes in support of the Cuban people. \r\n Mr. Mavroyiannis (Cyprus), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Finally, my delegation wishes to associate itself \r\nwith the statement delivered earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation supports the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Pakistan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n For 15 consecutive years, the General Assembly \r\nhas adopted resolutions urging all countries, in \r\ncompliance with the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe principles of international law, to repeal or \r\ninvalidate all laws and measures with extraterritorial \r\neffect that compromise the sovereignty of other States, \r\nundermine the legitimate rights and interests of entities \r\nand persons under the jurisdiction of those States and \r\naffect the freedom of trade and navigation. Regrettably, \r\nhowever, the long-term economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba imposed by its rich \r\nneighbour is still in place. \r\n In an age of economic globalization exchanges \r\nand cooperation on an equal footing among countries \r\nrepresent the trend of our times. Normal economic, \r\ncommercial and financial ties among countries are in \r\nthe interest of all countries, and are by no means a \r\nfavour given by any one country to others. Dialogue on \r\nan equal footing is the best way to resolve any \r\ndifference. The international community has the right \r\nto raise serious concerns over the embargo and \r\nsanctions suffered by Cuba over the years, and to \r\nrequest the county concerned to end such embargo and \r\nsanctions. \r\n The 40-odd years of embargo and sanctions \r\nagainst Cuba not only harm the interests of Cuba and \r\nmany other countries, thereby seriously hampering \r\ndevelopment efforts at the international level, they also \r\ngo against the principles of democracy, freedom, the \r\nrule of law and human rights.  \r\n First, the practice of attempting to force another \r\ncountry, through embargo and sanctions, to give up its \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n11 07-57058 \r\n \r\nright to independently choose its own path to \r\ndevelopment, even to overthrow its Government, \r\nconstitutes a violation of the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the basic norms \r\ngoverning contemporary international relations. That \r\nkind of practice has nothing to do with promoting \r\ndemocracy and freedom.  \r\n Secondly, the embargo and sanctions imposed \r\nagainst Cuba are extraterritorial in nature, and are \r\ntherefore in violation of international law and can by \r\nno means promote democracy and freedom in any \r\ncountry. They are opposed by all countries, and run \r\ncounter to the principle of trade liberalization.  \r\n Thirdly, the embargo and sanctions have seriously \r\nobstructed and constrained the efforts of the Cuban \r\npeople to eradicate poverty, improve their living \r\nstandards, pursue economic and social development \r\nand achieve the Millennium Development Goals. They \r\nundermine the rights of the Cuban people to life and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Chinese Government has always maintained \r\nthat countries should develop State-to-State relations \r\nbased on equality and in compliance with the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nand work to promote democracy and the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations. We believe that, in the light of \r\ntheir specific national conditions, countries should \r\nchoose their own political, economic and social \r\nsystems and their own mode of development. \r\nDifferences between States should be resolved through \r\ndialogue and cooperation and on the basis of equality \r\nand mutual respect. \r\n Given the foregoing, the Chinese Government \r\nrequests an early end to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo and sanctions imposed by the \r\ncountry concerned against Cuba. It is our hope that \r\nthere will be dialogue rather than confrontation, and \r\ncontacts and exchanges rather than embargo and \r\nsanctions. We hope that the relevant resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations will be implemented without delay. \r\nChina therefore supports the draft resolution submitted \r\nby Cuba under the current agenda item. \r\n Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Pérez Roque, \r\nwho is with us today, has explained in great detail the \r\nexact consequences of the United States blockade \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n We would like to express our gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report \r\ncontained in document A/62/92, which reflects the \r\nunanimous objection of Member States to the \r\nimposition of the unilateral and extraterritorial \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba.  \r\n Russia’s position on the draft resolution \r\nintroduced under this agenda item has not changed. \r\nOur country shares the view of the overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States, which resolutely condemns \r\nthe embargo against Cuba and calls for its end. We are \r\nconvinced that a halt to the embargo and the \r\nnormalization of United States-Cuba relations in \r\ngeneral would help to improve the situation and help \r\nfurther integrate Cuba into regional and global \r\nprocesses.  \r\n An appeal adopted on 18 October 2007 by the \r\nState Duma of the Russian Federation entitled “To the \r\nparliaments of United Nations Member States and \r\ninternational parliamentary organizations”, which will \r\nalso be submitted to the Secretary-General, emphasized \r\nthe following points. \r\n The continuing economic blockade against the \r\nRepublic of Cuba is an act of crude pressure by the \r\nUnited States of America against a sovereign State. \r\nAccording to Cuban authorities, two thirds of Cubans \r\nwere born under the blockade. The economic blockade \r\nalso hinders the normal functioning of every system \r\nnecessary for the lives of Cubans — including those \r\nrelating to the health system, including emergency \r\nservices for the severely ill, services for pregnant \r\nwomen and children, education, culture, science, \r\ntransport and utilities. The ongoing blockade \r\nundermines Cuba’s economy, with the most serious of \r\nconsequences for the various sectors of the economy. \r\nThe policy of economic blockade against Cuba \r\ninfringes upon the rights and legitimate interests of \r\nthird States.  \r\n The continuing commercial, economic and \r\nfinancial blockade of Cuba by the United States is \r\ncounterproductive and out of step with the spirit of the \r\ntimes in which we live. It is a remnant from the days of \r\nthe cold war. It prevents the establishment of a new \r\njust world order in accordance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law. \r\n The continuation of the blockade is also \r\nincompatible with the effort under way to reform the \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 12 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations, for it ignores the unanimous view of \r\nMember States regarding the need to work together to \r\nimplement the principles underpinning our efforts to \r\nabandon confrontation and embrace cooperation based \r\non respect for the rights of nations to choose for \r\nthemselves their political, economic and social \r\nsystems.  \r\n Guided by the fundamental principles of the \r\nCharter with regard to the inadmissibility of any \r\ndiscriminatory measure or interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States, Russia will continue its policy to vote \r\nin favour of the draft resolution calling for an end to \r\nthe blockade. \r\n Mr. Salim (India): We align ourselves with the \r\nstatement made by the Chairperson of the Group of 77.  \r\n The nearly five-decades-old economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America has been the annual subject \r\nof debate by this body since 1991. The embargo has \r\nbeen reinforced by domestic laws of the United States \r\nof America, through which the extraterritorial reach of \r\nthe embargo encompasses foreign companies as well as \r\nforeign subsidiaries of United States companies doing \r\nbusiness with Cuba or Cuban entities. Such domestic \r\nlaws include the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and \r\nthe Helms-Burton Act of 1996. \r\n The international community has been categorical \r\nin repeatedly expressing its opposition to the \r\nextraterritorial aspect of the embargo that has been \r\nimplemented in accordance with United States \r\ndomestic laws and regulations. We fully share that call \r\nby the international community. The General Assembly \r\nhas repeatedly rejected the imposition of laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all other \r\nforms of coercive economic measures. Through its \r\nresolutions, it has called upon all States to respect their \r\nobligations under the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law, as well as to repeal and invalidate \r\nlaws and measures that have extraterritorial effects on \r\nthe sovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests \r\nof entities or persons under their jurisdiction and the \r\nfreedom of trade and navigation. \r\n The continuation of the embargo against Cuba, in \r\nparticular through its extraterritorial effects, has \r\nhampered that country’s ability to pursue its \r\ndevelopment imperatives. It has also caused hardship \r\nto its population in a variety of ways. The impact of the \r\nembargo has been particularly severe in the area of \r\nmedical care, through a reduction in access to medical \r\nequipment, medicines and diagnostic aids. Other \r\naffected areas include food aid deliveries, the \r\neducation sector, international trade and investment, \r\ntransportation and access to financial markets. In \r\naddition, the embargo has had an indirect negative \r\nextraterritorial impact on Cuba’s efforts to provide \r\nassistance under South-South cooperation in the field \r\nof medicine, in particular to African countries. The \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development \r\nconcludes, in the report (A/62/92) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, that the embargo by the United States of \r\nAmerica has led to an adverse impact on gross \r\ndomestic product growth, export revenues, industrial \r\nand agricultural production, trade and social sectors \r\nsuch as food, health, education, communications and \r\nscience and technology, as well as trade diversion. \r\n Embargoes and economic blockades are against \r\nthe spirit of unhindered trade and commerce without \r\nbarriers. The embargo has achieved nothing, except to \r\ncreate hindrances on the path of development for the \r\npeople of Cuba. The continuation of the policy of \r\nsanctions and blockade, against the opinion of the \r\noverwhelming portion of the population of the world, \r\nis nothing but a desire to continue an age-old unjust \r\narrangement. That is all the more untenable in an era of \r\nglobalization, when its advocates are loudly \r\nproclaiming and working for barrier-free trade and \r\ncommerce and seamless movements of goods and \r\nservices around the world. \r\n Given their geographical proximity, the United \r\nStates of America and Cuba should be natural partners \r\nin trade, commerce and investment. We believe that a \r\nconsiderable part of the business sector in the United \r\nStates of the America would like to benefit from \r\nunhindered access to the Cuban market and that many \r\nUnited States citizens would like to establish greater \r\ncontacts with Cuba through tourism. The export of \r\nagricultural and medical products from the United \r\nStates of America to Cuba, insofar as permitted by the \r\nTrade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act \r\nof 2000, is testimony to the interest and potential of \r\ntrade and business contacts between the two countries. \r\nVarious legislative attempts in the United States of \r\nAmerica to relax the embargo also support that view. \r\nWe therefore look forward to the lifting of the \r\nsanctions and the embargo against Cuba. \r\n In conclusion, let me reiterate India’s opposition \r\nto unilateral measures by countries that impinge upon \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n13 07-57058 \r\n \r\nthe sovereignty of another country, including attempts \r\nto extend the application of a country’s laws \r\nextraterritorially to other sovereign nations. The \r\ninternational community must work towards \r\nestablishing a just international economic environment \r\nconducive to development for all countries, free from \r\nsanctions and embargoes. \r\n Mr. Butagira (Uganda): I associate myself with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Pakistan \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, as well as with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of Egypt \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.  \r\n Uganda supports the lifting of the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. To emphasize what I am going to say, let \r\nme begin by quoting what our leaders said on the issue \r\nof democracy and sovereignty in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome document.  \r\n  “We reaffirm that democracy is a universal \r\nvalue based on the freely expressed will of people \r\nto determine their own political, economic, social \r\nand cultural systems and their full participation in \r\nall aspects of their lives. We also reaffirm that \r\nwhile democracies share common features, there \r\nis no single model of democracy, that it does not \r\nbelong to any country or region, and reaffirm the \r\nnecessity of due respect for sovereignty and the \r\nright of self-determination.” (resolution 60/1, \r\npara. 135) \r\n We believe the people of Cuba have the right to \r\ndetermine how they are going to be governed and to \r\nchoose who should govern them and for how long. We \r\ntherefore view the attempt to impose sanctions on Cuba \r\nas an attempt to impose regime change in Cuba. That is \r\nnot acceptable. The embargo has hurt the people of \r\nCuba and has crippled their economic development. \r\nFor many years now, through this Assembly, the \r\ninternational community has consistently called for the \r\nlifting of the embargo. This almost universal voice \r\nshould be heeded. \r\n Isolationism does not do anybody or any country \r\nany good. Here in the United States, a number of \r\nvoices have been raised in support of lifting the \r\nembargo. Even one of the presidential candidates for \r\nnext year’s elections has said that, once elected, he \r\nwould lift the embargo against Cuba and establish \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States and \r\nCuba. \r\n It is high time that the United States authorities \r\nconcerned heeded those overwhelming voices and \r\nlifted the embargo, which has not served any useful \r\npurpose and is a relic of the cold war era. It is against \r\nthe principles of international law and free trade and is \r\ncontrary to the principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Bolivia wishes to align itself with \r\nthe statements made on behalf of the Rio Group, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and \r\nChina. \r\n After 47 years of a harmful embargo against \r\nCuba and after 15 General Assembly resolutions \r\ncalling for an end to the unilateral embargo by the \r\nUnited States, we see the utter failure of that \r\ncommercial, economic and financial embargo as a \r\nmechanism seeking to impose foreign ideologies on a \r\nsovereign nation. Historical facts such as the Second \r\nWorld War and the Viet Nam war, to mention just a \r\nfew, have shown that no brute force is capable of \r\nbreaking the unshakeable will of sovereign peoples in \r\ntheir struggle for their right to self-determination. On \r\nthe contrary, such force only serves to unite the people \r\nagainst their aggressors.  \r\n The eloquent details submitted by the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba have very clearly shown \r\nthe inhuman consequences of the embargo. The United \r\nStates policy of imposing an embargo against Cuba is \r\ncertainly a violation of the human rights of the Cuban \r\npeople and therefore deserves corresponding sanctions.  \r\n However, the Assembly cannot take such \r\ndecisions, because of the very provisions of the \r\nCharter. It is precisely for that reason that the \r\nresolutions adopted year after year, trying to put an end \r\nto the acts of aggression by certain countries, do not \r\nhave any real implications for those concerned. In \r\nreforming the United Nations, we should address the \r\nimperative need to empower the General Assembly to \r\ntake binding decisions on certain subjects, such as in \r\nthe case of violations of human rights.  \r\n The people of Bolivia reiterate its appeal to all \r\nthe world’s peoples to build genuine global peace \r\nbased on the principles of mutual respect among \r\npeoples, non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\ncountries, the quest for solutions to conflicts through \r\nrational and sincere dialogue and respect for Mother \r\nNature as the source of all wisdom. It is time to impose \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 14 \r\n \r\nreason. It is time to lift the inhuman embargo against \r\nthe sister country of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Abdellatif (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): We would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/62/92) on the implementation \r\nof resolution 61/11, entitled “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. My \r\ndelegation would like to express its support for the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Pakistan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. We would also \r\nlike to welcome the presence of the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba at this meeting \r\nof the Assembly. \r\n For more than 40 years, the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba has \r\nimpeded the economic and social development of that \r\ncountry and has caused great hardship for the Cuban \r\npeople. That has occurred even though the General \r\nAssembly and many other international forums and \r\nGovernments have called for an end to the embargo, \r\nwhich has not only been maintained, but has also been \r\nintensified through the enforcement of unilateral \r\nextraterritorial laws and provisions.  \r\n The embargo is in contravention of the basic \r\nprinciples of international law, the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the stipulations of the World Trade \r\nOrganization. It has been the longest embargo in \r\nhistory. Its continuation will only lead to further \r\ntension in bilateral relations and to further difficulties \r\nfor the Cuban people, particularly the most vulnerable \r\ngroups, such as women and children. \r\n The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya once again \r\nexpresses its strong opposition to unilateral measures \r\nimposed by certain States for political reasons. I would \r\nlike to express our great concern regarding the \r\ncontinued imposition by certain States, of an \r\nextraterritorial, coercive and unilateral economic \r\nembargo. This runs counter to the principles of \r\ninternational law, particularly the principle of equal \r\nsovereignty of States and non-intervention in the \r\ninternal affairs of other countries. The implementation \r\nof this embargo will increase the hardships of and \r\ndeepen the hatred and anger between peoples with \r\ncommon interests. That makes it critical to abide by the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and to seek \r\nappropriate and civilized solutions to problems, \r\nincluding ways to avoid infringement of such basic \r\nhuman rights as the rights to development, food, \r\nmedical care and essential social institutions. \r\n The imposition of embargoes and sanctions has \r\nnever been an appropriate way to solve problems \r\nbetween States. The United Nations Charter identifies \r\nappropriate measures for settling any bilateral issue \r\nthrough negotiation, reconciliation, mediation, \r\narbitration, investigation and transparent settlement \r\nmediated by international and regional organizations \r\nand agencies on the basis of equal sovereignty and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other \r\ncountries. States have reaffirmed that approach in the \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, which are \r\nimmediately binding because they embody justice and \r\nlogic and strengthen the principles of international law. \r\nMoreover, they send a clear message that \r\ncomprehensive peace cannot be achieved, friendly \r\nrelations between States cannot be established and \r\ndevelopment goals cannot be met without international \r\ncooperation based on mutual respect for the \r\nsovereignty of States, regardless of their size, their \r\npopulation and the nature of their economic and \r\npolitical system.  \r\n Mr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China on this agenda item. \r\n The General Assembly is deliberating again, for \r\nthe sixteenth year in a row, the agenda item regarding \r\nthe economic, trade and financial embargo imposed on \r\nthe Government and people of Cuba by the United \r\nStates of America. The issue came to the General \r\nAssembly after decades of the embargo, which has now \r\nstretched for 49 years. That is almost the entire period \r\nof the existence of the current Government of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba. \r\n The United Republic of Tanzania would like to \r\nreiterate its sympathy with the people and Government \r\nof Cuba and join other Members of the United Nations, \r\nwhose number has been growing by the year, in calling \r\nfor the ending of the embargo against the people and \r\nthe Government of Cuba.  \r\n Over the years, it has become evident that the \r\nwide-ranging embargo is specifically targeted to inflict \r\nmaximum suffering on the people of Cuba, ostensibly \r\nto undermine their Government. The victims have \r\nindeed been people across the board, with most \r\nsuffering experienced by the most vulnerable — the \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n15 07-57058 \r\n \r\nyoung, the old and people with disabilities. That is \r\nmorally reprehensible given that among the highest and \r\nmost respected values espoused by this Assembly are \r\nhuman life, human dignity and the protection of \r\ncivilians irrespective of race, colour or citizenship. \r\n It is an understatement to say that the heroic \r\nresilience of the Cuban people has made the embargo a \r\nfutile exercise. It is time to review that strategy, \r\nwhatever its worth, at a time when international peace \r\nand security, harmony and understanding are feverishly \r\nsought after by the international community after the \r\nend of the cold war and the emergence of new threats \r\nand discords in the world. \r\n The embargo was already biting and the people of \r\nCuba were heroically standing firm to weather its \r\nconsequences when the Torricelli and Helms-Burton \r\nActs were enacted to tighten the embargo by imposing \r\neconomic restrictions on third parties doing business \r\nwith Cuba. Embargoes and blockades are antiquated \r\nmeans of warfare at a time when there are multitudes \r\nof strategies, options and methods of resolving \r\ndifferences in the international community through the \r\nUnited Nations and bilateral and regional forums. Even \r\nin the face of some of the most threatening challenges \r\nto international peace and security, total embargoes, \r\nblockades or sanctions against civilians have been \r\nreplaced by more humane means of dealing with \r\nadversaries. \r\n There cannot be a better gauge of the disapproval \r\nof those outdated, civilian-targeted measures than the \r\noverwhelming support of this Assembly for the lifting \r\nof the embargo. We would be adopting double \r\nstandards if the views and support of this General \r\nAssembly on other issues were taken as a yardstick for \r\nmobilizing and advancing support or opposition to \r\nparticular policies — and such views are usually \r\nheeded by the concerned parties — but not on the issue \r\nof the blockade against Cuba. The United Republic of \r\nTanzania calls for wisdom to prevail by reviewing, \r\nprogressively easing and eventually lifting the embargo \r\nagainst a people whose only crime is to live on their \r\nsovereign soil.  \r\n The weather has not been kinder, either. As we \r\nspeak, the people of Cuba are bracing for the onslaught \r\nof yet another tropical storm, with the usual expected \r\ndevastation. Hurricanes visit that island almost every \r\nyear and cause untold damage to the economy and \r\nsocial infrastructure of the people. Those natural \r\ncalamities should be enough to prick the conscience of \r\npeople and Governments that attach value and respect \r\nto human life and the suffering of innocent people. \r\n On the contrary, more pain is added to injury by \r\nthe cumulative consequences of the embargo, which \r\nhave been passed on from one Cuban generation to \r\nanother. We hope that these appeals from this world \r\nrostrum will not be made in vain and will be heeded by \r\nall people who love peace, their elected \r\nrepresentatives, and leaders who are capable of \r\nbringing light to the end of this long, dark tunnel of \r\nembargoes and blockades against the people of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): Please allow me to \r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly for \r\nthe able manner in which he is presiding over this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n Zambia wishes to align itself fully with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Pakistan and \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, respectively. \r\n Zambia has noted with appreciation the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General, contained in document A/62/92, \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. We believe \r\nthat the report has provided us with an objective and \r\nclear analysis of the negative impact arising from the \r\nsanctions against Cuba. We maintain that the Helms-\r\nBurton legislation violates the sovereignty of Cuba and \r\nis a breach of international law, in addition to not being \r\ninline with the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, including those of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates, non-interference in their internal affairs and the \r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General once again \r\nvindicates the position consistently held by the \r\nAssembly over the years, namely, that the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba hurts innocent people, in particular the \r\nmost vulnerable, who are women and children. In \r\naddition, Zambia notes that, despite the hardship \r\ncaused by the embargo for more than four decades, the \r\nCuban people have become more determined and \r\nunited in defence of their country’s sovereignty, \r\nwelfare and dignity, for which they have sacrificed so \r\ndearly. \r\n Zambia has repeatedly called on the United States \r\nof America to lift the economic embargo against Cuba. \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 16 \r\n \r\nThe embargo has a direct negative impact on the \r\nprinciples of free trade and navigation. We have been \r\nand are committed to the strengthening of universal \r\nrespect for international law in the conduct of all forms \r\nof relations among sovereign States. \r\n Mr. İlkin (Turkey), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n Based on the information compiled by the \r\nSecretary-General in his latest report — and, indeed, in \r\nthe report of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba — Zambia will once again vote in favour of this \r\ndraft resolution. My delegation’s vote is based on \r\nZambia’s firm belief in the sanctity of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, which binds Member States. We \r\nreiterate that the embargo has adversely affected the \r\nwell-being of the Cuban people. \r\n In conclusion, Zambia appeals to all Member \r\nStates to support the call for the immediate ending of \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n Mrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Cuba — a country that is at once \r\nCaribbean, Taino, Latin American, African and \r\ninternationalist — has for more than 50 years \r\ncontinued to heroically resist the most aggressive \r\nimperialist policies in modern history. Cuba’s patriotic \r\ncourage and socialist conviction have been stronger \r\nthan the millions of dollars wasted on a war of \r\naggression. They have also been stronger than the \r\ninhuman and illegal commercial and economic \r\nblockade and all the technology invested by the empire \r\nto dash the dreams and will of the Cuban people.  \r\n Nicaragua, which was also a victim of the same \r\nsort of imperialist policies and commercial and \r\neconomic blockades, which included the mining of its \r\nports, experienced for itself the consequences of such \r\ninhuman measures against peoples undergoing \r\ndevelopment and seeking to recover their sovereignty \r\nand defend their natural resources in the face of \r\nferocious imperialist and colonialist plundering. \r\n Thanks to the indomitable will of its people, of \r\nRubén Darío and of Sandino, Nicaragua is today proud \r\nto join Latin America and the Caribbean in support of \r\nthe draft resolution (A/62/L.1) submitted by Cuba, \r\nthereby becoming the 184th assenting vote following \r\n16 years of shameful non-participation in the voting. \r\n Commercial relations in the international \r\ncommunity are today affected by the extraterritorial \r\nnature of the illegal commercial and economic \r\nblockade imposed by the United States against Cuba. \r\nAll those policies — along with so-called \r\ncomplementary legislation known as the Helms-Burton \r\nand Torricelli laws, the Cuban Adjustment Act and the \r\nCuban Transition Act, which is also known as the Bush \r\nplan — are intrusive and flagrant violations of \r\ninternational law that are reprehensible in any \r\ncircumstances.  \r\n As we discuss Cuba and the policies aimed \r\nagainst it today, we should remember the five Cuban \r\nheroes who continue to be unjustly imprisoned in \r\nUnited States jails. To them and their families, we send \r\nout our warmest expression of solidarity.  \r\n The cold war is a thing of the past. Various sorts \r\nof relations have blossomed in various countries. We \r\nourselves can attest as to how old political, ideological \r\nand even military adversaries are developing political \r\nand commercial relations in an environment of ever-\r\ngreater normalcy, in which each actor looks after his \r\nown interests without having to turn to blockades, \r\npressure and threats that have an impact upon the \r\nsovereignty and trade of third countries.  \r\n The inevitable question therefore is, Why is the \r\nwill of the international community, which demands \r\nand end to this political, commercial and economic \r\naberration, being disregarded year after year? Why \r\ndoes the illegal blockade against Cuba continue? Could \r\nit be because of Cuba’s example of human solidarity? \r\nCould it be because the Cuban people, while fighting \r\nagainst a criminal blockade, are sparing no effort to \r\njoin with their Government to help their brothers and \r\nsisters in the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of \r\nLatin America, as well as Caribbean, native, Latin \r\nAmerican, African and Asian peoples? Wherever there \r\nis humanitarian need, one will find Cuba’s doctors, \r\nteachers, technicians, academics and \r\ninternationalists — one will find the gaze of Che. That \r\nis how Cuba is, always willing to share what it has \r\nachieved through so much sacrifice and patriotism. It is \r\neven willing to share with developed countries \r\nthemselves — which, if they were not sometimes so \r\nproud, would accept the humanitarian assistance that \r\nCuba is always willing to provide to any country in the \r\nworld.  \r\n We commend the initiatives of the Cuban \r\nGovernment to achieve unconditional dialogue based \r\non an equal footing in order to help find a political \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n17 07-57058 \r\n \r\nsolution to this anachronistic blockade. We regret that \r\nthe response has always been the same, namely, the \r\nimposition of new measures to yet further expand the \r\neconomic and financial blockade against Cuba. \r\nNevertheless, we are encouraged by the fact that a \r\ngrowing number of American business people, \r\nreligious leaders, academics, scientists, students and \r\nelected officials are siding with the international \r\ncommunity, which, on the basis of international law, is \r\ndemanding a definitive end of the blockade against \r\nCuba. \r\n Whatever the empire’s reason or justification, the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America should \r\nend the commercial and economic blockade. Any \r\nproblems with real or potential effects on relations \r\nbetween countries should be resolved in a civilized \r\nmanner through dialogue and peaceful negotiation and \r\non the basis of mutual respect for the legal sovereignty \r\nand equality of States.  \r\n Latin America and the Caribbean, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and \r\nChina have categorically supported Cuba. Nicaragua, \r\nwhich has always maintained its solidarity, reiterates \r\nits unconditional support for the heroic people and \r\nGovernment of Cuba in their titanic battle against the \r\nconstant aggression of the empire and for the return of \r\nGuantánamo, as well as in its efforts to protect its \r\nachievements, sovereignty, self-determination and \r\nsocialist homeland. \r\n Mr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe): My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and by the representative of Pakistan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Zimbabwe would like to reiterate its firm \r\ncommitment and adherence to the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of States, \r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs and the \r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation. \r\nZimbabwe has consistently advocated for the \r\nrevocation of laws and measures with extra territorial \r\napplication that have been applied and are being \r\napplied unilaterally against Member States. \r\n It is a matter of public record that, for over four \r\ndecades, all the debates at the United Nations have \r\nobjected to the application of unilateral economic \r\nmeasures in order to achieve certain political \r\nobjectives. Numerous appeals from the majority of \r\nMember States and resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly have failed to convince successive United \r\nStates Administrations to end the unilateral measures \r\nimposed on the people and Government of Cuba. That \r\nextension of the territorial jurisdiction of the United \r\nStates to all countries is contrary to the principles of \r\nnational sovereignty and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other States, which are recognized \r\nunder international law and as set forth in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. That policy of the United States \r\nnot only undermines the Cuban people’s right to \r\ndevelopment but also contradicts the freedom of trade \r\nand navigation and contravenes the provisions of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization, of which the United States \r\nis a member. \r\n As if that were not enough, the Cuban people, \r\nlike their Zimbabwean counterparts, have been and \r\ncontinue to be bombarded by propaganda broadcasts by \r\nradio stations set up and financed by the \r\nAdministration in Washington. The ultimate aim of \r\nthose illegal broadcasts is to incite some sections of the \r\npopulations to effect regime change in both targeted \r\ncountries. The doctrine of regime change contradicts \r\nthe letter and spirit of the principle of sovereignty, \r\nwhich allows people to freely choose the socio-\r\neconomic and political dispensation of their liking. \r\nThere is no justification whatsoever for the \r\ncontinuation of those cruel, illegitimate and immoral \r\nUnited States hostile policies against the Cuban \r\nGovernment and its people. \r\n As a current victim of domestic laws and \r\nlegislation with extraterritorial impact, Zimbabwe fully \r\nunderstands the need to end the unilateral and illegal \r\neconomic embargo on Cuba. Zimbabwe therefore \r\nfirmly stands by the heroic people of Cuba in their \r\nfight against that illegal embargo. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.1. \r\n Before giving the floor to the representative of \r\nthe United States, who wishes to speak in explanation \r\nof vote before the vote, may I kindly remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 18 \r\n \r\n Mr. Goddard (United States of America): As in \r\nyears past, the United States wishes to point out the \r\nfundamental fact that the exercise of the sovereign \r\nright to decide whether and to what extent to trade with \r\nanother Government is a bilateral issue and, as such, \r\nshould not come before the General Assembly. We note \r\nthat many other States or regional groups have, from \r\ntime to time, determined to restrict transactions with \r\nothers for a variety of reasons. They should consider \r\nwhether this draft resolution sets a precedent that they \r\nwould find acceptable in other contexts. \r\n Cuba’s problems derive not from any decision of \r\nthe United States, but from the embargo on freedom \r\nthat the Cuban regime has imposed on its own people. \r\nThe Cuban Government denies its people information, \r\naccess to the outside world, the right to travel and \r\nopportunities to better their lives economically. We \r\nmaintain our policy of directing aid and trade into the \r\nhands of the Cuban people to break the absolute \r\ncontrol that the Cuban regime holds over the resources \r\nthat its people need. \r\n According to the Cuban Government’s own trade \r\nstatistics, the United States has exported nearly \r\n$2 billion in agricultural, medical and humanitarian \r\ngoods to Cuba since 2002. We are one of Cuba’s \r\nlargest suppliers of food and one of Cuba’s largest \r\ntrading partners. In 2006 alone, we authorized the \r\nprovision of over $270 million in food and medicines \r\nby private citizens and organizations, making the \r\nAmerican people the largest providers of humanitarian \r\naid to the Cuban people in the entire world. \r\n Now more than ever, we invite the Member States \r\nconsidering this draft resolution to reject the arguments \r\nof the Cuban Government and focus on effecting a \r\ntransition in Cuba that would restore its people’s \r\nfundamental rights. We also encourage Member States \r\nand non-governmental organizations to promote free \r\nand unfettered access to the Internet in Cuba by all \r\nCubans, to support independent libraries and \r\njournalists and to broaden educational opportunities for \r\nall Cuban young people, not just a privileged few. \r\n Finally, we call on the international community to \r\njoin together in demanding that the Cuban Government \r\nunconditionally release all political prisoners as the \r\nessential step in beginning a process that restores to the \r\nCuban people their basic human rights. \r\n It is long past time that the Cuban people enjoyed \r\nthe blessings of economic and political freedom. \r\nInstead of voting in favour of this draft resolution \r\ncondemning the United States for declining to engage \r\nin unrestricted financial transactions with a regime that \r\ndeprives its own people of the fundamental human \r\nrights that this body is charged with protecting, we \r\nurge Member States to oppose the draft resolution and \r\nto condemn the Cuban Government’s internal embargo \r\non freedom, which is the real cause of the suffering of \r\nthe Cuban people. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the voting. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.1. A recorded vote has been \r\nrequested. \r\n A recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour: \r\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua \r\nand Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, \r\nAustria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, \r\nBurkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, \r\nCanada, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, \r\nChad, Chile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, \r\nCosta Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, \r\nCzech Republic, Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, \r\nEritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, \r\nGabon, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, \r\nGreece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, \r\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic \r\nof), Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, \r\nKazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, \r\nMaldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Moldova, Monaco, Mongolia, \r\nMontenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, \r\nNamibia, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, \r\nOman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, \r\nParaguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n19 07-57058 \r\n \r\nQatar, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian \r\nFederation, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint \r\nLucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, \r\nSan Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi \r\nArabia, Senegal, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra \r\nLeone, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon \r\nIslands, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, \r\nSudan, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, \r\nSwitzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, \r\nThailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, \r\nTuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland, United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, \r\nUzbekistan, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of), Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, \r\nZimbabwe. \r\nAgainst: \r\nIsrael, Marshall Islands, Palau, United States of \r\nAmerica. \r\nAbstaining: \r\nMicronesia (Federated States of). \r\n Draft resolution A/62/L.1 was adopted by \r\n184 votes to 4, with 1 abstention (resolution \r\n62/3). \r\n The Acting President: Before giving the floor to \r\nspeakers in explanation of vote after the voting, may I \r\nkindly remind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.  \r\n Mr. De Lemos Godinho (Portugal): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\nThe candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and \r\nSerbia, and the European Free Trade Association \r\ncountries Iceland and Norway, members of the \r\nEuropean Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and \r\nMoldova, align themselves with this explanation of \r\nvote. \r\n The European Union believes that the trade \r\npolicy of the United States towards Cuba is \r\nfundamentally a bilateral issue. That notwithstanding, \r\nthe European Union and its member States have clearly \r\nexpressed their opposition to the extraterritorial \r\nextension of the United States embargo as contained in \r\nthe Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-\r\nBurton Act of 1996. \r\n The European Union cannot accept that unilateral \r\nmeasures imposed by the United States on specific \r\ncountries limit the Union’s economic and commercial \r\nrelations with third countries, in this case Cuba. \r\nTherefore, in November 1996, the Council of Ministers \r\nof the European Union adopted a regulation and a joint \r\naction to protect the interests of natural or legal \r\npersons resident in the European Union against the \r\nextraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton legislation \r\nthat prohibits compliance with that legislation. \r\n Moreover, on 18 May 1998, at the European \r\nUnion-United States Summit in London, a package was \r\nagreed covering waivers to titles III and IV of the \r\nHelms-Burton Act, a commitment by the United States \r\nAdministration to resist future extraterritorial \r\nlegislation of that kind and an understanding with \r\nrespect to disciplines for the strengthening of \r\ninvestment protection. The European Union continues \r\nto urge the United States to implement its side of the \r\n18 May 1998 understanding. \r\n The European Union’s policy towards Cuba is \r\nclear and was set out in a common position in 1996. \r\nThe objective of the EU in its relations with Cuba is to \r\nencourage a peaceful process of transition, led by the \r\nCuban people, to a pluralist democracy, respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, sustainable \r\neconomic recovery and an improvement in the living \r\nstandards of the Cuban people. The European Union \r\nunderlines its willingness to pursue a comprehensive \r\nand open dialogue with both the Cuban Government \r\nand Cuban civil society on all topics of mutual interest, \r\nincluding in the political, human rights, economic, \r\nscientific and cultural fields. The European Union \r\nreiterates its invitation for dialogue and welcomes the \r\nfact that preliminary talks took place in New York on \r\nthe occasion of this year’s session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The EU deplores the fact that the human rights \r\nsituation in Cuba has not fundamentally changed, \r\ndespite a decrease in the number of political prisoners \r\nand acts of harassment. The Cuban Government \r\ncontinues to deny its citizens internationally \r\nrecognized civil, political and economic rights and \r\nfreedoms. The EU once again urges the Cuban \r\nGovernment to release unconditionally all political \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 20 \r\n \r\nprisoners, which is a key priority in its policy towards \r\nCuba. In particular, the EU expresses its utmost \r\nconcern at the deteriorating health of several political \r\nprisoners who are members of the group of 75 political \r\nprisoners detained since March 2003. The EU calls on \r\nthe Cuban authorities to release them immediately. The \r\nEU also reiterates its call on the Cuban Government to \r\ngrant freedom of expression and free access to \r\ninformation. \r\n The Cuban Government’s achievements in health \r\ncare and education are undermined by its restrictions \r\non civil, political and economic rights. Domestic \r\nCuban economic policy — as well as the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States — seriously hampers the economic \r\ndevelopment of Cuba, negatively affecting the \r\nstandards of living of the Cuban people. \r\n With regard to the United States of America, we \r\nexpress our rejection of all unilateral measures against \r\nCuba, which are contrary to commonly accepted rules \r\nof international trade. We reiterate our view that the \r\nlifting of the United States trade embargo would open \r\nCuba’s economy, to the benefit of the Cuban people.  \r\n With regard to Cuba, the European Union urges \r\nthe Cuban authorities to bring about real improvements \r\nin all the areas I have mentioned. \r\n For all the reasons to which I have referred, and \r\nin spite of serious criticism on Cuba’s human rights \r\nrecord, the European Union has unanimously voted in \r\nfavour of the draft resolution. \r\n Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI have the honour to make this statement on behalf of \r\nthe countries of the Common Market of the South \r\n(MERCOSUR) — Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, \r\nVenezuela and Uruguay — as well as the associated \r\nStates of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. \r\n As in previous years, the member countries of \r\nMERCOSUR and associated States have voted in \r\nfavour of the draft resolution just adopted. We did so \r\nbecause it is consistent with the group’s traditional \r\nposition. Our vote is also in line with our position in \r\nfavour of multilateralism and in rejection of the \r\napplication of unilateral coercive measures that violate \r\nfree trade and transparent international trade — and are \r\ntherefore against the well-being of peoples and impede \r\nregional integration processes. \r\n The embargo against Cuba contravenes principles \r\nof international law, in particular the norms governing \r\ninternational trade and those linking the members of \r\nthe World Trade Organization. The embargo has been \r\ncondemned by the General Assembly and other forums \r\nand international organizations, including the \r\nOrganization of American States, the Latin American \r\nEconomic System, the Ibero-American summit and the \r\nsummit-level meetings of the Rio Group.  \r\n The countries of MERCOSUR and its associated \r\nStates once again reject the promulgation and \r\napplication of this sort of unilateral coercive measures \r\nwith extraterritorial reach, whose validity we do not \r\naccept. We therefore reiterate our support for \r\nmultilateralism as the peaceful and just way to resolve \r\ndisputes between States in a way that promotes \r\nunderstanding, security, human rights and cooperation. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\neconomic and financial blockade against Cuba has \r\nbeen in place for almost half a century. It undermines \r\nthe international principles of the equality of States and \r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs, as well as that \r\nof the freedom of international trade and navigation. \r\nThe overwhelming majority of Member States believe \r\nthe embargo against Cuba to be neither a civilized nor \r\na constructive way to address international disputes. \r\n The negative consequences of the application of \r\nthe extraterritorial policy of embargo pose the main \r\nobstacles to the speedy implementation of the projects \r\nand programmes for the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of Cuba that are being implemented \r\ntoday. The blockade is causing hundreds of millions of \r\ndollars in damage to Cuba’s economy and social \r\nsituation. The future and health of the population are at \r\nstake.  \r\n Every country has the right to choose its own \r\nmodel for development. We believe it is impermissible \r\nfor any individual country to attempt to force its will \r\nupon others through the use of military, economic or \r\nother means.  \r\n We continue to admire the courage of the Cuban \r\nnation, which continues to be an exemplary defender of \r\nthe dignity and sovereignty of the Cuban people. \r\nBelarus is proud to take this opportunity to join its \r\nvoice with others demanding an end to the embargo \r\nagainst the Cuban people. \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n21 07-57058 \r\n \r\n Mr. Khoc (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We would \r\nlike to reiterate our view that the policy of unilateral \r\nboycott by the United States against Cuba must be \r\ncondemned. The international community has \r\nrepeatedly condemned such hostile policies. There is \r\ntoday growing rejection in the international community \r\nof such unilateral policies adopted by Washington, as \r\nexemplified by the unjust financial, trade and \r\neconomic blockade against Cuba — especially given \r\neverything that country has suffered, in particular by \r\nits women and children. \r\n The United States that always preaches to the \r\nworld about human rights, is violating such human \r\nrights by imposing an embargo against Cuba. The \r\nUnited States boycott and embargo are a crime against \r\nhumanity. They violate the Charter of the United \r\nNations in the most flagrant way and also violate \r\ninternational law and trade laws. The Charter clearly \r\nstates that pressures on Member States because of their \r\nnational choices and their political, economic and \r\nsocial systems are rejected and undemocratic and \r\nwarrant condemnation and denunciation. \r\n The Sudan has suffered a great deal from \r\nWashington’s unilateral policies. We therefore voted in \r\nsupport of the draft resolution. Such a vote is a vote \r\nagainst unilateralism, hegemony and against any one \r\ncountry’s imposition of its policies and dictates against \r\nanother through interference in their internal affairs. \r\n My country would like to express its support for \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of Pakistan \r\nand Egypt on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, respectively. We would \r\nlike to reiterate our solidarity with the people and \r\nGovernment of Cuba. We demand that the unjust \r\nblockade and embargo be lifted immediately.  \r\n Mr. Lynn (Myanmar): My delegation associates \r\nitself with the statements delivered on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and \r\nChina.  \r\n We welcome the report of the Secretary-General \r\non the necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba (A/62/92).  \r\n For 15 years, the international community has \r\ncontinuously expressed its unequivocal support for the \r\ncall to end the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo by the United States against Cuba. The \r\nSummit Conference of Heads of State or Government \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries, held in Havana in \r\nSeptember 2006, also reiterated its call upon the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America to put an \r\nend to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba.  \r\n The promulgation and application by Member \r\nStates of laws and regulations with extraterritorial \r\neffects on the sovereignty of other States and the \r\nlegitimate interests of persons under their jurisdiction, \r\nas well as the freedom of trade and navigation, violates \r\nboth the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the universally accepted principles of \r\ninternational law. Strictly adhering to that principle, \r\nMyanmar opposes all forms of economic and financial \r\nsanctions and embargoes that are contrary to \r\ninternational law. As one of the initiators of the Five \r\nPrinciples of Peaceful Coexistence, Myanmar \r\nscrupulously respects the principles of the sovereign \r\nequality of States, non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other \r\ncountries.  \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States on Cuba has adversely \r\naffected the Cuban people and Cuban nationals living \r\nin other countries. \r\n The embargo has also negatively impacted third \r\nparties. The blockade imposed on the health sector in \r\nparticular causes undue suffering and hardship to the \r\nCuban people. That act is inhumane and we therefore \r\nstrongly oppose such measures. Those measures can in \r\nno way promote peace and stability in the region. For \r\nthat reason, Myanmar wholeheartedly associates itself \r\nwith the call by the international community on the \r\nUnited States to bring an end to the embargo and \r\nsanctions against Cuba. \r\n My delegation, in reaffirming our opposition to \r\nlaws and regulations that have extraterritorial effects \r\nand as a manifestation of our friendship towards the \r\nGovernment and people of Cuba, therefore voted in \r\nfavour of resolution 62/3. \r\n Mr. Hill (Australia): Australia has consistently \r\nexpressed its opposition as a matter of principle to the \r\npromulgation and application by Member States of \r\nextraterritorial laws and measures where such laws and \r\nmeasures affect the sovereignty of other States, the \r\nlegitimate interests of entities or persons under their \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 22 \r\n \r\njurisdiction, as well as freedom of trade and \r\nnavigation.  \r\n Such laws and measures are not justified by the \r\nprinciples of international law and comity. Australia is \r\ntherefore concerned about the extraterritorial aspects of \r\nthe Helms-Burton act of 1996 and, for that reason, has \r\nagain voted for the resolution submitted under the \r\nagenda item.  \r\n Our vote should not be interpreted as in any way \r\nendorsing the internal policies of Cuba. Holding \r\npolitical prisoners and failing to comply with \r\ninternational human rights standards is not an internal \r\nmatter; it should be of concern to all of us. We should \r\ntake every opportunity to remind Cuba of its \r\ninternational obligations and urge its full cooperation \r\nwith international human rights treaties, bodies and \r\nmechanisms. In particular, we should urge the Cuban \r\nGovernment to meet its responsibilities to respect the \r\nrights of all its population.  \r\n The Cuban Minister today claimed that the \r\nblockade is the main obstacle to the rights of the Cuban \r\npeople. He will, with respect, have greater credibility \r\nin pursuing that argument when he can show that the \r\ninternal rights of all Cuban people are properly \r\nrespected and protected by his own Government. \r\n Mr. Tharyat (Indonesia): Indonesia associates \r\nitself with the statements made by the representatives \r\nof Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nof Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Indonesia voted in favour of resolution 62/3, as \r\nwe believe that the actions highlighted therein not only \r\nundermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and international law, but also \r\nseverely threaten the freedom of trade and investment. \r\nThose sentiments were echoed during the thirty-first \r\nannual ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, held in New York on 27 September, where \r\nministers once again firmly rejected the imposition of \r\nlaws and regulations with extraterritorial impact and all \r\nother forms of coercive economic measures, including \r\nunilateral sanctions against developing countries. \r\n The application of an economic and trade \r\nembargo will only produce negative effects on the \r\neconomic and social lives of innocent people, \r\nespecially women and children. Those measures also \r\nconstitute a major impediment to the full enjoyment of \r\nthe right to development by a sovereign State and its \r\npeople. Such a policy is also not in line with the spirit \r\nof global partnership for development, as set out in the \r\nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.  \r\n Indonesia therefore urges an end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba and \r\ncalls on all countries to adhere to the principles of \r\nequality, mutual respect, good-neighbourliness and \r\nrespect for human rights. \r\n Mr. Rezvanian (Islamic Republic of Iran): My \r\ndelegation voted in favour of resolution 62/3, just \r\nadopted by the General Assembly, on the necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba. While endorsing the statements made by \r\nthe representatives of Egypt and Pakistan on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, respectively, I would like to make the following \r\nremarks in explanation of our vote on the said \r\nresolution. \r\n The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nbelieves that the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba runs counter to the principles of \r\ninternational law governing relations among States and \r\ncontradicts the letter and spirit of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, which calls for promoting solidarity, \r\ncooperation and friendly relations among nations. Such \r\nmeasures have adverse impacts on the living conditions \r\nand human rights of the Cuban people and will hamper \r\nthe efforts of the Cuban Government to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, including the Goals \r\nof eradicating poverty and promoting health and \r\neducation, which are indispensable means of economic \r\nand social development. \r\n The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation calls \r\nupon States to “refrain from… any unilateral \r\nmeasure… that impedes the full achievement of \r\neconomic and social development by the population of \r\nthe affected countries, in particular women and \r\nchildren” (A/CONF.199/20, annex, para. 102). The \r\nsame paragraph further indicates that such unilateral \r\nmeasures hinder the well-being of the affected people \r\nand create “obstacles to the full enjoyment of their \r\nhuman rights, including the right of everyone to a \r\nstandard of living adequate for their health and well-\r\nbeing and their right to food, medical care and the \r\nnecessary social services”. \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n23 07-57058 \r\n \r\n Paragraph 101 of the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation stipulates that “States should cooperate \r\nto promote a supportive and open international \r\neconomic system that would lead to economic growth \r\nand sustainable development in all countries”. It adds \r\nthat trade policy measures for environmental purposes \r\nshould not constitute a means of arbitrary or \r\nunjustifiable discrimination in international trade. \r\n The adoption of the said resolution is indicative \r\nof the strong objection of the international community \r\nto unilateral economic coercive measures in general \r\nand the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba in \r\nparticular. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran shares fully the \r\nconcern of the international community on the \r\nimposition of unilateral measures with extraterritorial \r\napplications. In that regard, it sympathizes with the \r\nCuban Government and people and therefore \r\nemphasizes the urgent need to put an end to such \r\nmeasures and for the full implementation of the \r\nresolution that the General Assembly adopted today. \r\n Mr. Khammanichanh (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): Over the past four decades, the innocent \r\npeople of Cuba have continued to endure the miseries \r\nresulting from the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nupon their country.  \r\n It is disappointing to witness such lingering \r\nunilateral and discriminatory commercial practices in \r\ntoday’s world of interdependence and multilateral \r\ncooperation among States. Moreover, the \r\nimplementation of extraterritorial or unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures is a direct violation of the objectives and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law, as well as of the freedom of trade \r\nand navigation. \r\n In accordance with the relevant resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, a Member State must neither \r\npromulgate nor enforce any law, regulation or measure \r\nwhose extraterritorial effects jeopardize the \r\nsovereignty of another Member State, since every \r\nnation has the sovereign right to participate freely in \r\nthe international financial and commercial systems.  \r\n On the basis of the universal principle of \r\nsovereign equality under the United Nations Charter \r\nand international law, no nation has the right to \r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of another, despite any \r\ndifferences in their socio-political systems. As a \r\nsovereign and independent nation, the Republic of \r\nCuba has the right to choose its own political system \r\nand the path of development that best suits its specific \r\nconditions.  \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic joins the \r\nmajority of United Nations Member States in \r\nreaffirming the urgent need to put an end to the \r\neconomic, financial and commercial embargo against \r\nCuba. That long-standing blockade has already caused \r\nthe Cuban people immeasurable material losses and \r\neconomic damage. As Members of the United Nations, \r\nwe should do everything we can to help Cuba to fully \r\nreclaim its legitimate right to integrate into the \r\nglobalized economy. In that spirit, our delegation voted \r\nin favour of draft resolution A/62/L.1. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Permit me at the outset to express my \r\ncountry’s support for the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and by the representative of Egypt on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The principles and purposes of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations affirm every country’s right to exercise \r\nits sovereignty on its own territory and to \r\nnon-interference in its internal affairs. Thousands of \r\nresolutions adopted by the United Nations since its \r\nfounding in 1945 have reaffirmed the sanctity of those \r\nprinciples and purposes.  \r\n The Organization’s host country, the United \r\nStates of America, after having itself bitterly suffered \r\nfrom others’ interference in its internal affairs and \r\ninfringement of its sovereignty before and during the \r\nSecond World War, played an active and essential role \r\nin the formulation of the Charter’s text. That fact \r\nwould make one expect the United States to respect the \r\nCharter, which serves as the Organization’s \r\nconstitution and its first and last point of reference. \r\nHowever, because the unilateral embargo imposed by \r\nthe United States against Cuba and the new measures \r\ntaken to reinforce it are completely inconsistent with \r\nthe Charter and international law — which are based \r\non the principles of the sovereign equality of States, \r\nnon-interference in others’ internal affairs and freedom \r\nof international trade and navigation — those measures \r\nare illegal and are completely incompatible with the \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 24 \r\n \r\nnorms of international relations and constitute an \r\nunprecedented challenge to international law. \r\n Cuba has suffered from the blockade for more \r\nthan 47 years. That is a precedent that we decisively \r\nreject, together with any other kind of unilaterally \r\nimposed extraterritorial and extrajudicial action by one \r\nState against another. The Cuban people, particularly \r\nchildren and the elderly, have suffered economically, \r\nsocially and politically from the embargo, which is \r\nhaving a pernicious effect on their efforts to achieve \r\nprosperity and well-being. \r\n My delegation expresses its appreciation of the \r\nfact that Cuba continues to attempt to engage in \r\nconstructive dialogue with the United States to settle \r\nall these controversial issues on the basis of the \r\nprinciples of equal sovereignty, mutual respect, \r\nnon-interference in other States’ internal affairs and \r\nrespect for the principles and purposes of the United \r\nNations Charter and the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness. My delegation believes that the two \r\ncountries should have normal relations that would \r\nserve the interests of their peoples. In that connection, \r\nwe should like to reaffirm the right of all peoples to \r\nchoose their own economic, political, social and \r\ncultural systems of their own free will and in \r\nconformity with the norms of international law.  \r\n The fact that 183 States supported this resolution \r\nlast year and 184 this year shows that a resounding \r\nmajority of States want an end to the embargo against \r\nCuba and reaffirm the need to respect the national \r\nsystems chosen by each country in perfect freedom and \r\nin accordance with its own national interests. \r\n The international community has reiterated \r\nseveral times its rejection of all unilateral sanctions \r\nimposed against Cuba, including the so-called Helms-\r\nBurton Act, promulgated by the Government of the \r\nUnited States. That law exceeds the national \r\njurisdiction of the United States and affects the \r\nsovereignty of other States that have relations with \r\nCuba, which is incompatible with the principle of the \r\nsovereign equality of States and of international law. \r\nFurthermore, Syria condemns the most recent measures \r\nagainst Cuba, announced by the United States of \r\nAmerica a few days ago in an attempt to destroy the \r\npolitical, economic and social system chosen by the \r\nCuban people.  \r\n Despite the constant appeals of the General \r\nAssembly for 16 consecutive years, the Government of \r\nthe United States of America has yet to take any \r\nmeasures to comply with those requests by the \r\ninternational community. It wilfully and obstinately \r\ncontinues to pursue its wrongful policy, ignoring the \r\ninternational community’s legitimate demands. My \r\ncountry hopes that all embargoes and similar measures \r\nimposed by the United States against many countries, \r\nincluding Cuba and my country will be lifted. We hope \r\nthat not only the voice of the international community \r\nthrough the General Assembly, but also those of all \r\nother international organizations and agencies will be \r\ntotally heeded and respected by the United States of \r\nAmerica and by its legislative bodies. On the basis of \r\nthis, Syria voted in favour of the draft resolution.  \r\n It was surprising and significant to see that Israel \r\nvoted against the draft resolution. The draft resolution \r\nwas carried by an overwhelming majority of votes, and \r\nthe negative vote by Israel shows in addition that Israel \r\ndoes not view international law as anything of value. \r\nThe entity concerned is an isolated minority in the \r\ninternational community. Things worsened for Israel \r\nwhen it voted against this draft resolution related to the \r\nactions of the United States of America. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.  \r\n Two representatives have requested to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. Allow me to remind all \r\nmembers that statements in the exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention \r\nand to five minutes for the second intervention and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mrs. Núñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The representative of the United States today \r\nreiterated the traditional lies fabricated to support, \r\nstrengthen and universalize the failed and illegal policy \r\nof hostility, genocidal embargo and aggression by the \r\nempire against Cuba.  \r\n The representative of the regime fraudulently \r\ninstalled in Washington, confirmed the frustration, \r\ndespair and personal hatred that the dubious tenant of \r\nthe White House, George W. Bush, feels for the Cuban \r\npeople. In its attempt to overthrow the revolution and \r\nimpose its imperialist designs on Cuba, the United \r\nStates Government encourages violence and invokes \r\nthe use of force against the Cuban nation.  \r\n On 24 October, the unpopular and bellicose \r\nMr. Bush announced an unprecedented escalation of \r\n A/62/PV.38\r\n \r\n25 07-57058 \r\n \r\nthe policy of the Government of the United States \r\nagainst Cuba. He announced more embargos against \r\nthe Cuban people, more subjection and more and \r\nrenewed efforts to subdue, through hunger and disease, \r\nthe unshakeable sovereign will arising from the \r\nresistance of thousands of men, women and children.  \r\n Never before has the essence of Bush’s policy \r\ntowards our country — that is, reconquering Cuba by \r\nforce — been so clear. The chicken hawks in \r\nWashington are mistaken if they think they can \r\nintimidate us. Millions of Cuban women and men will \r\ncontinue to defend, at the price of our own lives, the \r\nsacred victories of the Cuban revolution: freedom, \r\ndignity, social justice and the sovereignty we fully \r\nenjoy.  \r\n If, in the escalation of their current economic, \r\npolitical and diplomatic war against Cuba, they make \r\nthe mistake of launching themselves into a direct \r\nmilitary aggression, we can assure them that they must \r\nbe prepared to confront, in our country, a resistance \r\nthat will only end when the independence and \r\nsovereignty of our people are assured. We are prepared \r\nto defend our homeland and socialism. We believe in \r\nthe truth and justice that are the basis for the vitality of \r\nthe Cuban revolution. We wish to thank the world for \r\nits valuable solidarity with and support to Cuba.  \r\n We understand perfectly well the illegal and \r\nincorrect interpretation that Mr. Bush and the people in \r\nhis regime apply to the concepts of freedom and human \r\nrights. Only a criminal dictatorship with demented \r\nhegemonic pretensions such as that of Bush could \r\nbomb innocent civilian populations in the name of \r\nfreedom and kidnap, imprison and torture defenceless \r\npeople in the name of human rights and the so-called \r\nwar against terror. \r\n The Government of the United States is alone in \r\nits policy towards Cuba. Today, the almost universal \r\nrejection of the genocidal embargo against the people \r\nof Cuba has been confirmed. The United States must \r\nrespect the right of Cubans to their independence and \r\nsovereignty. It must immediately cease its policy of \r\naggression and threats against Cuba. It must renounce \r\nthe failed idea of fabricating a mercenary opposition in \r\nCuba and stop the radio and television war against our \r\ncountry. It must immediately and unconditionally lift \r\nthe genocidal embargo. It must abandon its policy of \r\nencouraging illegal immigration from Cuba. It must \r\nrelease the five Cuban anti-terrorism fighters who are \r\npolitical prisoners in United States prisons and put an \r\nend to the impunity that allows Luis Posada Carriles \r\nand dozens of other anti-Cuban agents to operate freely \r\nin the United States.  \r\n If the United States truly were interested in \r\nhuman rights, it would not have established torture \r\nchambers in the illegal base at Guantanamo and would \r\nhave put an end to the bombing of innocent civilians in \r\nIraq.  \r\n Those who are accomplices in the anti-Cuban \r\npolicy of the Bush regime deserve little credit. A \r\nGovernment like that of Australia has no moral \r\nauthority by which to criticize Cuba. As for the \r\nEuropean Union, I must once again note with regret its \r\nhypocrisy, bankrupt self-analysis and lack of ability to \r\ndefine an independent policy towards Cuba. The \r\nEuropean Union’s supposed concern for human rights \r\nhas no credibility when its members and associated \r\nStates are encouraging and systematizing racism and \r\nxenophobia, discriminating against immigrants, \r\nfacilitating the illegal and secretive transfer of persons \r\nwho were kidnapped or arbitrarily detained by the \r\nCentral Intelligence Agency or Pentagon of the United \r\nStates and providing secret facilities for the illegal \r\ndetention and torture of presumed terrorists. What \r\nrespect can be given to Governments who are \r\nhypocritically opposed to an impartial investigation by \r\nthe former Commission on Human Rights into the \r\natrocities perpetrated in the torture chambers at \r\nGuantanamo?  \r\n Cuba will not be intimidated, and our unity \r\ncannot be broken. Our people only unite further when \r\nfaced with imperial threats and arrogance. Such acts \r\nhave not been able to subjugate our people. As our \r\nHead of State, Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro, has \r\nsaid, they will never have Cuba. If necessary, we are \r\nready to confront the imperialist aggressors in the \r\ntrenches, side-by-side with millions of Cubans. \r\n Mr. Goddard (United States of America): I \r\napologize for taking the floor again, but my delegation \r\nis obliged to exercise our right of reply.  \r\n The resolution inaccurately blames the United \r\nStates for the hardships of the Cuban people, while \r\nexonerating the Cuban Government’s own policies, \r\nwhich deny the rights of the Cuban people to a fair \r\nwage for their labour, to own a business or to otherwise \r\nexercise their rights in the marketplace.  \r\nA/62/PV.38  \r\n \r\n07-57058 26 \r\n \r\n The resolution also inaccurately claims that the \r\nUnited States embargo is a violation of freedom of \r\nnavigation, that is, a blockade. In fact, the United \r\nStates policy of limiting bilateral transactions with the \r\nCuban regime does not prevent the rest of the world \r\nfrom trading with Cuba or providing Cuba with access \r\nto food or medicine.  \r\n Most seriously, the resolution does not refer to \r\nthe embargo on freedom that the Cuban regime has \r\nimposed on its own people, which even prevents \r\nUnited Nations and other international human rights \r\norganizations from travelling to Cuba and meeting \r\nfreely with the Cuban people. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor once \r\nagain to the representative of Cuba to exercise the right \r\nof reply for the second time. \r\n Mr. Amorós Núñez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOnce again, we note that the arguments of the United \r\nStates are baseless. Obviously, they have not taken into \r\naccount what happened here today, when 184 countries \r\nclearly expressed their opposition to the blockade \r\npolicy, not for the reasons stated by the United States, \r\nbut simply because it is an act which is totally contrary \r\nto the provisions of the Charter of United Nations and \r\ninternational law.  \r\n We do not accept in any way the reasoning given \r\nby the United States. We insist that the blockade is the \r\ngreatest violation of human rights of the Cuban people \r\nand that it is the factor preventing us from making \r\nfurther progress in the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of our people. We therefore do not \r\nrecognize what has just been said here.  \r\n Everything that the delegate of the United States \r\nhas said is further proof of that country’s mendacious \r\npolicy, which is not endorsed by the international \r\ncommunity and is clearly rejected by the United \r\nNations. Nothing is true in what he has stated. We are \r\nnot going to pursue this any further, we simply wish to \r\nindicate that Cuba does not recognize what has been \r\nsaid here. In addition, the vote that took place today is \r\na clear reflection of the international community’s \r\nopposition to this policy, which, more than anything \r\nelse, more than just constituting a violation of the \r\nhuman rights of the Cuban people, is a clear indication \r\nof the genocidal policy against our people. I am not \r\ngoing to pursue this any further. Once again, we \r\nbelieve that what he has said here is not worthy of any \r\nrecognition, has no authority and has no chance of \r\nbeing accepted by those present here, particularly by \r\nthe delegation of Cuba. \r\n The Acting President: Since there are no further \r\nrepresentatives who wish to take the floor, may I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 21? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n"
