(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 45 \r\n \r\nSport for peace and development \r\n \r\n (a) Sport for peace and development \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/325 \r\nand Corr.1) \r\n \r\n (b) Building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution A/62/L.2 \r\n \r\n The President: I would like to say that I assume \r\nthat the Olympic spirit will prevail today, as Pierre de \r\nCoubertin would have liked, and that attendance by \r\nMember States will be more impressive. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of China to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/61/L.2. \r\n Mr. Liu Qi (China) (spoke in Chinese): As \r\nPresident of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the \r\nGames of the 29th Olympiad, and on behalf of the \r\nChinese delegation, I have the great honour to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/62/L.2, entitled “Building \r\na peaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal”. \r\n The Olympic Truce, a time-honoured tradition, \r\nhas its roots in the Olympic truce treaty among Greek \r\ncity-states participating in the ancient Olympic games, \r\nwhich had a history of more than 1,000 years. The \r\ntreaty was thus observed longer than any other peace \r\naccord in history. The modern Olympic movement, \r\nwhich came into being in 1894, has inherited the \r\ntraditions of the ancient Olympic games. At its very \r\nheart lies the pledge to safeguard world peace and \r\npromote the common development of mankind, while \r\nat the same time upholding the Olympic spirit: swifter, \r\nhigher, stronger. \r\n The United Nations and the Olympic Movement \r\nare natural allies. The Olympic ideal accords with the \r\nUnited Nations purpose of promoting peace. Since \r\n1993, the General Assembly has adopted seven \r\nresolutions on the Olympic Truce, urging all Member \r\nStates to observe the Truce. The United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), adopted in \r\n2000, also urged Member States to observe the \r\nOlympic Truce and to support the promotion of peace \r\nand human understanding through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal. \r\n All of that amply demonstrates that the United \r\nNations and its Member States attach great importance \r\nto the role played by sport and the Olympic ideal in \r\npromoting world peace and that they hope to create a \r\nfavourable atmosphere and conditions for the success \r\nof the Olympic Games. \r\n In line with past practice, China, as the host \r\ncountry for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, has \r\nproposed the draft resolution entitled “Building a \r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal” (A/62/L.2). The draft resolution not \r\nonly captures the quintessential elements of previous \r\nresolutions, but also features the three main concepts \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 2 \r\n \r\nthat are at the core of the Beijing Olympic Games, \r\nnamely, the Green Olympics, the High-tech Olympics \r\nand the People’s Olympics, and their vision to achieve \r\na harmonious development of society. It recognizes the \r\nincreasingly important role of sport in the \r\nimplementation of the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals and reaffirms the commitments \r\nundertaken in this regard by the heads of State and \r\nGovernment gathered at the 2005 World Summit. The \r\ndraft resolution urges Member States to observe the \r\nOlympic Truce during the Games of the \r\nXXIX Olympiad in Beijing, which will take place from \r\n8 to 24 August 2008, and the subsequent Paralympic \r\nGames in Beijing, which will take place from 6 to \r\n17 September 2008. \r\n The draft resolution also welcomes efforts of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee and the National \r\nOlympic Committees of United Nations Member States \r\nto undertake concrete actions to promote and \r\nstrengthen a culture of peace and harmony based on the \r\nspirit of the Olympic Truce and calls upon all Member \r\nStates to continue to use sport as an instrument to \r\npromote peace, dialogue and reconciliation. \r\n China has received constructive comments and \r\nsuggestions from many delegations during the \r\nconsultations on the draft resolution. The draft \r\nresolution is sponsored by 183 countries. On behalf of \r\nthe Chinese Government and the Beijing Organizing \r\nCommittee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, I \r\nwould like to convey my thanks to all countries for \r\ntheir support for the draft resolution. It is my sincere \r\nhope that the General Assembly will adopt the draft \r\nresolution by consensus. The adoption of the draft \r\nresolution will help enhance appreciation and \r\nunderstanding by all peoples of the Olympic ideal of \r\npeace and will contribute to world peace. \r\n The Olympic Truce is not only the ideal of the \r\nOlympic movement but also the common aspiration of \r\nall peace-loving peoples around the world. The theme \r\nof the Games of the XXIX Olympiad — “One world, \r\none dream” — and its core concepts of the Green \r\nOlympics, the High-tech Olympics and the People’s \r\nOlympics give full expression to the common desire of \r\nthe Chinese people and peoples of the entire world for \r\npeace, progress, friendly relations and harmonious \r\ndevelopment. To that end, the Beijing Organizing \r\nCommittee has launched various activities to promote \r\nthe Olympic Truce, enhance understanding of the \r\nOlympic Truce in China and throughout the world and \r\nincrease the influence of the Olympic ideal of peace. \r\n We have organized a series of events to promote \r\nthe concept of peace, including the campaign to solicit \r\nsongs for the Olympic Games; the “Fuwa — the \r\nOlympic mascots — bring good luck to the world” \r\ncampaign; and an Olympic sculpture exhibition. We \r\nhave named the Olympic torch relay the Journey of \r\nHarmony, a name that captures the vision of peace, \r\nharmony and cooperation. We have distributed \r\nOlympic readers and wall charts to schools designated \r\nOlympic Education Model Schools, and have launched \r\nthe Heart-to-Heart Partnership Programme and a \r\nBeijing Olympic Youth Camp. These educational \r\nprogrammes are sowing the seeds of peace, friendship \r\nand progress among the public, in particular among \r\nyoung people. During the Beijing Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games, a wall for peace and friendship will \r\nbe erected at the Olympic and Paralympic villages to \r\ncollect signatures from athletes and other people and to \r\nappeal for observance of the Olympic Truce and the \r\npromotion of world peace. \r\n The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and \r\nits President, Mr. Jacques Rogge, have been working \r\ntirelessly to promote the Olympic ideal of peace. I take \r\nthis opportunity to express our deep appreciation for \r\ntheir commitment. Thanks to the concerted efforts of \r\nthe IOC and the parties concerned, the International \r\nOlympic Truce Foundation and the International \r\nOlympic Truce Centre have been established, \r\ncontributing to the promotion of the Olympic ideal of \r\npeace worldwide. \r\n We also thank Mr. Adolf Ogi, Special Adviser to \r\nthe Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, for his hard work, and we will continue to \r\nsupport the work of his Office. \r\n Peace and development are two major themes in \r\ntoday’s world. Unfortunately, regional conflicts and \r\nlocal turbulence still occur, making our quest for world \r\npeace more of an uphill journey. The Olympic Games \r\nmay not change the world overnight, but we have every \r\nreason to expect that the Olympic Truce, an ancient \r\nOlympic tradition, will continue to inspire the world in \r\nstriving for lasting peace and common prosperity.  \r\n I wish to take this opportunity to call on all \r\nMember States to adhere to the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations, to observe the Olympic Truce \r\nand to promote world peace. In 282 days, the Olympic \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n3 07-57301 \r\n \r\nFlame — burning bright for solidarity, friendship and \r\npeace — will be lit in the main stadium of the Beijing \r\nOlympic Games. That is of great significance both to \r\nthe Olympic Movement and to China, an ancient \r\ncivilization with a time-honoured history. The \r\ninternational community looks forward to the success \r\nof the Beijing Olympic Games. At present, all of the \r\npreparatory work is taking place as scheduled. All the \r\nvenues will be complete by the end of the year, except \r\nfor the National Stadium, which will be ready in early \r\n2008 in accordance with plans for the opening \r\nceremony. \r\n The Beijing Olympic competition schedule has \r\nbeen finalized. To facilitate the coverage of the Games \r\nby the foreign media, last year the Chinese \r\nGovernment formulated regulations on reporting \r\nactivities in China by foreign journalists during the \r\nBeijing Olympic Games and the preparatory period. In \r\naddition, various programmes are already up and \r\nrunning, including preparations for the opening and \r\nclosing ceremonies, the torch relay outside the Chinese \r\nmainland, media and communications, Olympic \r\neducation and culture, and volunteer training. \r\n I am convinced that, with the support of all \r\nUnited Nations Member States and their peoples, the \r\ngames of the twenty-ninth Olympiad will surely be a \r\ncomplete success. \r\n The President: I would like to warmly welcome \r\nMr. Jacques Rogge, President of the International \r\nOlympic Committee to the General Assembly, and \r\nMr. Liu Qi, President of the Beijing Organizing \r\nCommittee for the Games of the Twenty-Ninth \r\nOlympiad.  \r\n Today, the General Assembly will hold a debate \r\nunder agenda item 49, “Sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment”, and consider draft resolution A/62/L.2 \r\nregarding the contribution that the Olympics can make \r\nto that overarching goal.  \r\n In 2005, world leaders committed to promoting \r\nthe role of sport in creating peace, achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \r\nimproving public health. The convening power of sport \r\nis unsurpassed, even by the United Nations. While the \r\nUnited Nations has 192 Member States, the \r\nAssociation of National Olympic Committees has 205 \r\nmembers. As the President of the Beijing Organizing \r\nCommittee, Mr. Liu Qi, rightly pointed out, the United \r\nNations and the Olympic Movement are natural allies. \r\n Sport helps to break down social, religious and \r\nethnic barriers by promoting tolerance and mutual \r\nunderstanding. Sport can change lives for the better by \r\nbuilding self-esteem, leadership skills, community \r\nspirit and bridges across ethnic and communal divides. \r\nWhen teams and individuals come together to share \r\ntheir common passion for sport, everyday differences \r\nare set aside. Rivalries remain, but they are fought over \r\ngoals, fastest times or longest jumps. Sporting \r\nspectacles provide the opportunity to transcend \r\neveryday differences for the crowds that come to enjoy \r\nthem.  \r\n Sport has also sometimes played a decisive role \r\nin diplomatic life and in re-establishing good \r\nrelationships between countries. That is the \r\nembodiment of the ancient Greek concept of ekecheria, \r\nor “Olympic Truce”. The General Assembly considers \r\nthis concept to be an important part of promoting \r\ninternational understanding and maintaining peace. The \r\nfact that there are over 180 sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution on building a peaceful and better world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal is a testament to \r\nthe universal nature of sport and its importance in \r\nhuman society.  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate China on the honour of holding the \r\ntwenty-ninth Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008. The \r\nmain themes of the Games — “Green Olympics”, \r\n“High-tech Olympics” and “People’s Olympics” — are \r\nstrongly supported by this house. I recently visited the \r\nOlympic sites in Beijing and noticed with great \r\npleasure the enthusiasm and pride on the faces of the \r\nChinese people who are constructing them.  \r\n Sport contributes to economic and social \r\ndevelopment. It improves health and personal growth, \r\nin particular for young people, and provides real \r\nalternatives to violence and crime. The United Nations \r\nworks closely with the International Olympic \r\nCommittee to develop strategic partnerships with the \r\ninternational sport community to promote education, \r\nhealth, HIV/AIDS prevention, gender equality, \r\nenvironmental protection, peace and reconciliation.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s report, entitled “Sport \r\nfor development and peace: progress and prospects” \r\n(A/62/325), sets out many concrete examples of \r\ninitiatives that Member States, United Nations funds, \r\nprogrammes and agencies, non-governmental \r\norganizations and the private sector have undertaken to \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 4 \r\n \r\npromote the agenda to implement the three-year Action \r\nPlan nationally and internationally. I would like to \r\ncommend those Member States that have reported \r\ntaking concrete steps to enhance national policies and \r\nstrategies that advance sport for development and \r\npeace, including by addressing gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment.  \r\n I would also like to note the work undertaken by \r\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Liberia to use \r\nsport to bring previously warring factions together; by \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund, working with \r\nnational Governments and sports associations to use \r\nsport as a vehicle to promote life skills and responsible \r\nsexual behaviour to prevent HIV/AIDS; and by the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme to mobilize \r\nresources to achieve the MDGs in Africa, Asia and \r\nLatin America by organizing football matches against \r\npoverty, and in Burundi, Rwanda, Sri Lanka and \r\nIndonesia, where sport has been integrated into post-\r\nconflict and humanitarian programmes.  \r\n However, the Secretary-General recommends a \r\nmore systematic follow-up by all Member States and \r\nUnited Nations bodies to more effectively use sport as \r\na tool to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nand greater recognition of its value to promote healthy \r\nlives and peace. \r\n If we are going to build a world of greater \r\ntolerance, mutual understanding and peace, sport must \r\ncontinue to be used to channel energies away from \r\naggression and self-destruction and into learning and \r\nself-respect. That is, indeed, the essence of the \r\nOlympic spirit and ideal.  \r\n Mrs. Moutawakel (Morocco) (spoke in French): \r\nIt is an honour and a privilege for me to address the \r\nAssembly in my capacity as Minister for Youth and \r\nSport of the Government of His Majesty the King of \r\nMorocco, and as an Olympic champion and member of \r\nthe International Olympic Committee (IOC). \r\n Ever since the establishment of ekecheria, or \r\n“Olympic Truce”, in ancient Greece, the permanent \r\nimmunity of the Olympia sanctuary has been \r\nrecognized. Athletes, artists and their families, as well \r\nas ordinary pilgrims, were able to travel safely in order \r\nto participate in and attend the Olympic Games and \r\nthen return home. As the opening of the Games \r\napproached, the sacred Truce was advocated and \r\nannounced by people travelling from one citadel to \r\nanother to transmit the message.  \r\n It is on the basis of that ancient international \r\nagreement that the IOC took the initiative of ensuring \r\nrespect for the Olympic Truce, with the support of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in a world where armed conflicts \r\nare constantly increasing. Thus, at its forty-eighth \r\nsession, the General Assembly adopted on 25 October \r\n1993 a resolution on respect for the Olympic Truce, of \r\nwhich the Kingdom of Morocco was a co-sponsor. At \r\nthat session — a historic one for the Olympic \r\nMovement — another resolution was adopted \r\nproclaiming 1994 as the International Year for Sport \r\nand the Olympic Ideal, commemorating the centenary \r\nof the IOC, founded in 1894 at the Sorbonne \r\nUniversity in Paris by the French pedagogue Baron \r\nPierre de Coubertin. \r\n It seems clear to me that the basic principles of \r\nthe Olympic Charter are very closely linked to the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations. The effort to educate \r\nand protect young people so that they can help build a \r\nbetter and peaceful world is a noble objective that the \r\nKingdom of Morocco has always supported by \r\nsponsoring United Nations resolutions in that area. The \r\nsocial and universal dimension of sport has been \r\nfrequently stressed by His Majesty King \r\nMohammed VI, as evidenced by the special importance \r\nthat the Government of Morocco attaches to making all \r\nsports available to everyone throughout the country for \r\nthe well-being of young people and the population as a \r\nwhole. \r\n Sport is an instrument that can usefully serve to \r\npromote peace, dialogue, reconciliation, solidarity and \r\nthe search for diplomatic and peaceful solutions. Sport \r\nalso involves competition and an effort to surpass not \r\nonly an adversary, but oneself as well. It represents a \r\ncivilized approach involving civilized behaviour in \r\nstrict respect for rules.  \r\n Many United Nations institutions have \r\nsuccessfully cooperated with the Olympic Movement \r\nin the humanitarian sphere by popularizing measures \r\nthrough the spokesmanship of world-renowned \r\nathletes. The United Nations has also worked to \r\npromote sport for the building of peace. The substantial \r\ncontribution of sport to the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals has not only been \r\nhighlighted, but is stressed in resolution 55/2 of \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n5 07-57301 \r\n \r\n8 September 2000, entitled United Nations Millennium \r\nDeclaration. \r\n Sport is a human right. The Charter of Physical \r\nEducation and Sport, adopted by UNESCO in 1978, \r\nstipulates that all human beings have the fundamental \r\nright to physical education and sport. Similarly, the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the \r\nright of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play \r\nand recreational activities appropriate to the age of the \r\nchild.  \r\n The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \r\nof Discrimination against Women also stresses the \r\nimportance of access to sport. Women have the right \r\nand the capacity to be involved at all levels of social \r\nlife. It is therefore our duty to expand the role of \r\nwomen in society and to make it easier for them to \r\nassume positions of responsibility. I am pleased and \r\nproud to note that there are seven women ministers in \r\nthe current Government of Morocco under the \r\nleadership of Prime Minister Abbas El Fassi.  \r\n We are also all concerned about protecting the \r\nenvironment. Although significant progress has been \r\nmade since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the IOC was \r\nthe first body to ensure that its Earth Covenant was \r\nsigned by all national Olympic committees and \r\ninternational federations at the 1992 Barcelona \r\nOlympic Games. The main issue, however, is that, \r\nwhen they engage in sport, human beings want to do so \r\nin an unpolluted environment, thus helping to protect \r\nthe natural world that fills us with joy and gives us \r\nfood and drink. To be sure, the Olympic Games and \r\nsport cannot make the world better definitively, but \r\nsport requires sharing, gives men and women the \r\nopportunity to get in good physical shape, and helps \r\nchildren to understand the meaning of victory, \r\nexcellence and team spirit.  \r\n I ran for the pleasure of sport. That opened so \r\nmany horizons for me and helped me to deal with \r\nnumerous social pressures. I consider myself today to \r\nbe an ambassador of sport and of my country, duty-\r\nbound to share the experience that I earned so dearly, \r\nas well as the true value of sport in comforting all \r\nthose who suffer under prejudice and unequal \r\nopportunities.  \r\n Volunteers are the most important resource that \r\nsport enjoys in its development. It is therefore \r\nnecessary to promote the work of volunteers who serve \r\ncommunities in a spirit of solidarity. However, we need \r\nto combat such scourges as drugs, doping and \r\nHIV/AIDS in order to protect the health and well-being \r\nof our young people. Violence and racism in the \r\ncontext of sport have also become an issue of serious \r\nconcern, and we must therefore stress a policy of \r\npreventive education to ensure that they do not spread, \r\nparticularly among young people.  \r\n In August 2005, the Kingdom of Morocco hosted \r\nthe Second Pan-African Youth Leadership Summit and \r\nidentified its priority objective as mobilizing young \r\npeople through sport and encouraging actions \r\nundertaken by private and public partners to raise \r\nyoung Moroccans’ awareness of the benefits of sport, \r\neducation, health, development and peace. In \r\napplication of the principle of sport for all and in \r\nkeeping with General Assembly resolution 61/10, \r\nentitled “Sport as a means to promote education, \r\nhealth, development and peace”, Morocco has \r\nundertaken a series of activities to ensure that sport is \r\nunderstood as the right of all individuals, without \r\ndistinction of race or social class. \r\n The sport policy adopted by the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco has allowed us to promote activities for \r\nyoung people in rural and exurban environments and to \r\nprioritize the participation of girls and women in sport. \r\nOur policy has had the positive impact of significantly \r\nraising the number of members of national sport \r\nfederations. In 2006, it helped over 292,000 young \r\npeople by instituting a national sport programme \r\ninvolving sports schools and awareness-raising \r\nactivities for various sports, as well as inter-communal \r\ntournaments. Moreover, Morocco’s resolve to ensure \r\nthe participation of disabled people in sport has made \r\nsport a tool of social integration for that sector of the \r\npopulation by encouraging the disabled to participate \r\nin various international sporting events. \r\n The national human development initiative \r\nlaunched by His Majesty King Mohammed VI on \r\n18 May 2005 attaches particular importance to sport in \r\nthe implementation of development projects throughout \r\nthe country. It recognizes that participation is critical to \r\nthe success of sporting activities designed to benefit \r\nthe youth of Morocco. Indeed, the projects that have \r\nbeen undertaken in the context of that initiative have \r\ncreated a true socio-cultural dynamic in the less \r\nprosperous rural and urban districts through the \r\norganization of events and the construction of sports \r\nfacilities. In 2006, over 70,000 people, including \r\n26,000 women, participated in sporting events, and \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 6 \r\n \r\n21 sports facilities were constructed, while 13 others \r\nare in the process of completion. \r\n I was privileged and honoured to participate as an \r\nathlete in the Olympic Games and through my \r\nresponsibilities in the international Olympic family to \r\ncontribute, on behalf of my country, to the \r\nimplementation of the Olympic ideal that is dear to all \r\nof us and should guide our steps as we seek to build a \r\nworld of peace, development and well-being for all. \r\nMy presence here in the General Assembly is, in fact, \r\nbut the simple continuation of my country’s \r\ncommitment to implementing the aims and principles \r\nof the United Nations and to promoting and applying \r\nthe Olympic ideal. \r\n In that regard, I take this opportunity to express \r\nmy country’s support for draft resolution A/62/L.2, \r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”. As a sponsor of the draft \r\nresolution, Morocco seeks to demonstrate its tireless \r\nsupport for the principles and ideals contained therein.  \r\n I also take this pleasant opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the people and Government of China, \r\nwhich are preparing to host the summer Olympics in \r\nAugust 2008. My delegation is convinced that the \r\ngames to be held in that great country, with its \r\nmillennial civilization, will be an opportunity once \r\nagain to reaffirm our devotion to Olympic values and \r\nwill certainly make a significant contribution to \r\nrenewing the Olympic ideal. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco is convinced that sport \r\nis a preparation for life that guarantees the \r\ndevelopment of the individual and the enhancement of \r\nthe individual’s ability to serve sustainable \r\ndevelopment, community and country. Better yet, \r\nsport, which propagates such humanist values as \r\ntolerance and understanding among peoples, is an \r\nindispensable element and enduring school of life that \r\nwe must continue to cultivate to ensure peace and \r\nsolidarity in the international arena. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea, who will \r\nspeak on behalf of the Asian States. \r\n Ms. Park (Republic of Korea) (spoke in \r\nChinese): On behalf of the Asian States, the delegation \r\nof the Republic of Korea is speaking in support of the \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Building a peaceful and better \r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal”. We are \r\nconvinced that the August 2008 Olympic Games to be \r\nheld in Beijing under the themes “Green Olympics”, \r\n“High-tech Olympics” and “People’s Olympics” will \r\nbe crowned with success. \r\n As a country of Asia, which has twice hosted the \r\nOlympic Games, the Republic of Korea expects the \r\nBeijing Games — the third to be held on our \r\ncontinent — will contribute to world peace and \r\nconciliation, as well as to regional peace and \r\nreconciliation. We also hope that Members will respect \r\nthe Olympic Truce and support the initiative of sport \r\nfor human development. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Peru, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States. \r\n Mr. Voto-Bernales (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nNext year, Beijing will host the twenty-ninth Olympic \r\nGames from 8 to 24 August and the 2008 Beijing \r\nParalympic Games from 6 to 17 September. Those \r\nevents will focus the world’s attention on thousands of \r\nathletes who will do their best in the practice of a \r\nnumber of activities within the 35 Olympic sporting \r\ndisciplines. \r\n The impressive mobilization of resources, efforts \r\nand dreams that are part of the Olympic Games also \r\noffers another opportunity to recall the Olympic ideal \r\nand to use sport as a means to promote peace and \r\nunderstanding among human beings. The embodiment \r\nof that ideal involves the athletes, their trainers, the \r\njudges, the sports authorities and the many others who \r\nwill gather in Beijing next year. However, it is also an \r\nopportunity to promote the ideal of peace through the \r\nobservance of the Olympic Truce. We hope that the \r\nTruce will be observed around the world, and that, at \r\nthe very least, the clash of arms and the tragedy of war \r\nwill be suspended during the celebration of the \r\nOlympic Games. The Olympic Truce also must be an \r\noccasion to open a space for dialogue, peace and \r\nreconciliation where conflicts and violence are \r\nentrenched. \r\n The practice of sport is also an opportunity to \r\npromote the development of human beings. It is \r\ntherefore necessary to recall the important role that \r\nsport should play in the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals agreed in 2000, as \r\nwell as the commitments assumed in that regard by our \r\nheads of State and Government at the 2005 Summit. \r\nThe United Nations must continue supporting such \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n7 07-57301 \r\n \r\ninitiatives in order to put the incentives and potential \r\nresulting from the practice of sport within reach of all \r\nhuman beings. \r\n Taking such considerations into account, and on \r\nbehalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, I am pleased to express the support of our \r\nregion for the draft resolution submitted by the \r\ndelegation of China under the title “Building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, \r\nas well as our commitment to helping ensure that the \r\nOlympic ideal is the best legacy of the Olympic and \r\nParalympics Games that Beijing will host in 2008. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Benin, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe African States. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): The \r\nAfrican Group thanks you, Sir, for convening this \r\nplenary meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nimportance of promoting sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment. We thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the item under consideration.  \r\n We welcome the presence here today of the \r\nPresident of the International Olympic Committee, the \r\nPresident of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the \r\nGames of the Twenty-Ninth Olympiad, and \r\nMrs. Moutawakel, whose name is well known among \r\nyoung Africans because of the extraordinary feats of \r\nprowess she has accomplished, thereby earning special \r\nrenown for African women and African sports. \r\n The report offers a thorough overview of the \r\nvarious aspects and issues involved. It identifies in a \r\nvery explicit and informative way the progress \r\nachieved during the first year of the three-year road \r\nmap for the implementation of the United Nations \r\nAction Plan to strengthen the contribution of sports to \r\npeace and development. \r\n In describing activities carried out at various \r\nlevels, the report helps us to appreciate the extent to \r\nwhich sport has been instrumental in fostering peace \r\nand development. We commend the fact that the report \r\nencompasses all actors and stakeholders, with due \r\nregard for the dynamic of their mobilization, and \r\naccounts for the policies and strategies applied. \r\n Mr. Jallow (Gambia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The report attests to the flourishing in many \r\ncountries of the invaluable potential of sport as a tool \r\nfor strengthening international peace and security and \r\nunderstanding among the people of the United Nations. \r\nThe activities carried out have given true meaning to \r\nthe spirit of the Olympic Truce. We welcome the \r\npeacebuilding initiatives launched in countries \r\nemerging from conflict, and especially the assistance \r\nprovided to them in restoring their full participation in \r\nthe world Olympic Movement and international events. \r\nSimilarly, the report shows that sport has been a \r\npowerful lever in the pursuit of the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, especially the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, and the high value assigned to \r\nsocial integration efforts targeting the various \r\ncategories of people with special needs.  \r\n We welcome with genuine satisfaction the \r\nmanifold partnerships and initiatives that have paved \r\nthe way for a worldwide mobilization involving not \r\nonly Member States, but also the United Nations funds, \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies, as well as \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations and \r\nsports organizations. We particularly commend the \r\nUnited Nations Office of Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, and especially the Special Adviser, for their \r\nendeavours to ensure the necessary support for the \r\nmost important events staged in the process of \r\nimplementing the Action Plan. It is worth highlighting \r\nin this debate the fact that the Office displayed a high \r\ndegree of commitment by organizing the Global Youth \r\nLeadership Summit in 2006, an outstanding initiative \r\nfor which it deserves full recognition.  \r\n We commend the Special Advisor for his \r\nendeavours to help establish close cooperation between \r\nthe African Union and the European Union, with the \r\nfull involvement of African institutions, devoted to \r\npromoting the development of sporting activities in \r\nAfrican countries.  \r\n As regards the draft resolution entitled “Building \r\na peaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal” and the issues it addresses, we should \r\nlike to place on record the adherence of the African \r\nGroup, which shares the concerns motivating it and the \r\nsolicitations it contains.  \r\n In less than a year, the twenty-ninth Olympic \r\nGames will take place in China. We welcome the \r\nresolve of the Government and people of China to \r\nperpetuate that global sporting event, which will take \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 8 \r\n \r\nplace in the spirit that was born with the first games in \r\nancient times. The modern Olympic Games represent a \r\nmeeting of young people for peace in 2008 in full \r\ncompliance with international standards, because sport \r\npromotes the building of a better world and encourages \r\ndevelopment, including the fulfilment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We congratulate \r\nChina for having earnestly assumed the task of \r\norganizing the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing, in \r\naccordance with international norms under the motto \r\n“One World, One Dream”, as well for its joint \r\nendeavours in the social field at the local, national, \r\nregional and global levels.  \r\n Africa will make its contribution to the \r\nobservance of the Olympic Truce called for in the draft \r\nresolution. No other continent needs more than Africa \r\nto harness the positive energy generated by sport for \r\nsuch encounters, mutual understanding and \r\nreconciliation. It is in the interest of African \r\nGovernments and peoples to take advantage of that \r\nopportunity to enhance awareness of the need to foster \r\nthe culture of peace within and among the countries \r\nthrough the promotion of dialogue by maximizing the \r\nimpetus anticipated from active participation in the \r\nforthcoming Beijing Olympiads.  \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation has taken note with great satisfaction of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report entitled “Sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace: progress and prospects”, \r\nwhich he has submitted to the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session to review the steps taken over the \r\npast year to implement the three-year Action Plan \r\nincluded in last year’s report of the Secretary-General.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s report recalls yet again \r\nthe source of the enthusiasm for sport for development \r\nand peace. Sport is an effective and efficient tool for \r\nmeeting so many of humanity’s challenges. As \r\nreported, many Member States, as well as United \r\nNations funds, programmes and specialized agencies, \r\nhave benefited over the past year from sport in \r\nsuccessfully addressing such pressing issues as racism, \r\nthe plight of street children, gender inequality, \r\ntraumatized youth and obesity all around the world. It \r\nis all the more encouraging as a clear sign that the \r\nInternational Year for Sport and Physical Education in \r\n2005 and previous General Assembly resolutions are \r\nhaving a lasting effect. Sport is no longer seen merely \r\nas a desirable asset; it is now recognized as a cost-\r\neffective tool for advancing human development. The \r\nfact that this shift has been achieved within only a few \r\nyears is remarkable in and of itself.  \r\n Switzerland is therefore pleased by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s decision to renew the mandate of his Special \r\nAdviser on Sport for Development and Peace. The \r\ncurrent Special Adviser and his support team have \r\nagain this year delivered a convincing performance and \r\nSwitzerland thanks them for their fruitful efforts. \r\nHowever, we agree with the recent statement of the \r\nSecretary-General that their work is not finished.  \r\n The Special Adviser must remain the global \r\nadvocate to lead the efforts of the United Nations \r\nsystem to promote sport as a tool for development and \r\npeace. Moreover, as reflected in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, the Special Adviser is in a unique \r\nposition to facilitate partnerships across all sectors of \r\nsociety. The United Nations needs a Special Adviser to \r\npursue that useful and important task.  \r\n Finally, the Special Adviser represents the \r\nSecretary-General and the United Nations system at \r\nvarious global sporting events, such as the 2008 \r\nOlympic Games in Beijing. That allows him not only \r\nto promote sport for peace and development, but also \r\ndirectly to address people around the globe on behalf \r\nof the United Nations.  \r\n Since its inception, Switzerland has been one of \r\nthe main supporters of the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser. In addition, together with the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia to the United Nations, we \r\nchair the Group of Friends of Sport for Development \r\nand Peace, composed of 28 permanent representatives \r\nto the United Nations.  \r\n To date, the status of the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser has been provisional and somewhat uncertain. \r\nGiven the Secretary-General’s recent decision to renew \r\nthe Special Adviser’s mandate, Switzerland, on behalf \r\nof the Group of Friends, has been collaborating with \r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser and the Secretariat, \r\nalong with all other interested Members, to identify \r\nfeasible options for a more stable arrangement. We \r\ntherefore welcome the Secretariat’s plans to establish a \r\ntrust fund on sport for development and peace within \r\nthe secretariat in Geneva, with a point of contact in \r\nNew York.  \r\n The formal establishment of an Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser would be a strong signal that the \r\nUnited Nations intends to continue promoting the use \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n9 07-57301 \r\n \r\nof sport as a tool for advancing development and \r\npeace. Moreover, we hope that the new arrangement \r\nwill ease the way for more Member States to provide \r\nfinancial support for the activities of the Special \r\nAdviser. There is urgent need for such support and we \r\ncall on them all to provide additional resources to \r\nenable the Special Adviser’s team adequately to \r\nsupport the core functions of the Special Adviser. \r\nSwitzerland is prepared to continue to do so. We also \r\nhope that the General Assembly will have the \r\nopportunity at this session to decide on a resolution on \r\nsport for peace and development. Such a resolution \r\ncould welcome a more stable structure, confirm its \r\nstrategic orientation and ask the Secretary-General to \r\nreport back on this issue at the sixty-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly.  \r\n My delegation takes this opportunity to express \r\nits full support for the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport \r\nand the Olympic ideal”. We are convinced that such \r\ninitiatives can have concrete results and ensure that the \r\nGames are conducted in peace.  \r\n Mr. Pataki (United States of America): Today, \r\nthe Assembly has the honour of invoking the spirit of \r\nthe Olympic Truce. For several Olympiads, the United \r\nNations has advocated the Olympic Truce with a view \r\nto protecting, as far as possible, the interests of the \r\nathletes and sport in general, and to contributing to the \r\nquest for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts.  \r\n It is a distinct privilege to welcome as witnesses \r\nto our work this morning members of the International \r\nOlympic Committee (IOC), led by IOC President \r\nJacques Rogge and including senior American \r\nmembers Ms. Anita DeFrantz and Mr. James Easton. \r\nFurther, it is with delight that the United States \r\ndelegation notes the presence of the United States \r\nOlympic Committee, led by its Chief of International \r\nRelations, Mr. Robert Fasulo. The distinguished \r\nservice of those leaders and countless other volunteers \r\nhas indeed built a better and more peaceful world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal. Let me just add \r\nthat it is an honour for me, as a former Governor of the \r\nstate of New York, which is proud to have twice hosted \r\nthe winter Olympics, to rise in honour of this \r\ndelegation.  \r\n The practice of heralding an Olympic Truce \r\nduring the games to enable the safe passage and \r\nparticipation of attendees through areas of conflict is \r\namong the oldest of accords, dating from 776 BC. \r\nHistory reveals that the Olympic Truce has transcended \r\ndifferences whenever people meet people on the fields \r\nof fair play.  \r\n As has been the case on eight occasions in this \r\nHall since 1993, the United States is honoured to be \r\namong the sponsors of today’s draft resolution \r\nproclaiming the Olympic Truce, entitled “Building a \r\nbetter and more peaceful world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal”.  \r\n But it is not so much that the Assembly proclaims \r\nthe Truce as that its action today essentially validates \r\nthe natural, truce-like atmosphere that prevails \r\nthroughout the world community whenever countries \r\nmeet on Olympic fields. In that sense, the Olympic \r\nTruce was revived not by this Assembly in 1993; \r\nrather, it was revived upon the convening of the \r\nmodern Olympic Games themselves in 1896. As in \r\nancient times, the Olympic Truce’s central purpose has \r\nbeen to enable the safe passage and participation of all \r\nconcerned with the Games. Indeed, it has contributed \r\nto that end through the centuries during war and peace.  \r\n Historical interpretations differ slightly. Did the \r\nancient games come before the Truce among warring \r\nStates, or was the ancient Truce necessary for the \r\npassage and participation of those who were otherwise \r\nenemies to meet at ancient Olympia? What is certain is \r\nthat the Olympic Truce, attributed to the Oracle at \r\nDelphi, is at the pinnacle of the principles and purposes \r\nof Olympism.  \r\n To understand better the heritage of the Truce, \r\nOlympic historians are now identifying more closely \r\nthe wording of the ancient Truce. They know that it \r\nwas inscribed on a discus solemnly displayed in the \r\nTemple of Hera adjacent to the ancient stadium at \r\nOlympia.  \r\n The world witnessed extraordinary human \r\nachievement in the shadow of that temple, not only \r\ncenturies ago, but in recent months. Superhuman \r\nefforts contained by mere metres the rampaging fires \r\nthat nearly engulfed the ancient sites of Olympia. \r\nBrave firefighters preserved the sites from which the \r\nheralds were sent forth to call for the safe passage of \r\nall the Games. The ferocious fire threatened the heart \r\nof the Olympic Movement; the fire was overcome. \r\nHaving been tamed, now it will ignite the Olympic \r\ntorch on its way from the ancient fields to modern \r\nBeijing.  \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 10 \r\n \r\n Today’s draft resolution exhorts the world to \r\novercome similar threats — geopolitical threats — and \r\nto similarly tame them so as to ignite humankind to \r\npursue the goals and ideals of international \r\nunderstanding, security and prosperity, as envisioned in \r\nthe United Nations Charter.  \r\n Today, Member States adopt the Olympic Truce \r\nat the United Nations. Next August, competitors will \r\nswear the athletes’ oath of fair play at the opening \r\nceremonies. Let those solemn practices inspire all \r\nothers to make their own truces with conflicts in their \r\nlives that keep them from pursuing their own goals and \r\nideals. Bringing the Olympic Truce closer to home \r\ntakes us from being spectators of excellence to being \r\nactual participants. Let today’s draft resolution be \r\nimplemented at all levels: intergovernmental, national, \r\ncommunity, household and personal.  \r\n Intergovernmentally, the Olympic Truce will \r\ncontinue to enliven various forms of United Nations \r\ncollaborations in the field to promote peace through \r\nsport. Nationally, the Olympic Truce might be further \r\ninterpreted to suggest a time-out from societal unrest as \r\neach country supports its Olympic competitors. \r\nCommunities and households can draw heavily on the \r\nexample of Olympic accomplishment, and so inspired \r\nmight commit to excellence in everyday pursuits. \r\nIndividual witnesses to the Games can see fair play at \r\nwork, and so moved might commit to fighting \r\ntemptations that otherwise would keep them from \r\nrealizing their goals and ideals.  \r\n So today, our consideration here reminds the \r\nworld to prepare for the forthcoming Games in spirit as \r\nwell as in body. Sport is not an end in itself, but rather \r\na means to educate the youth of the world for the \r\nharmonious development of mankind.  \r\n To promote the Olympic Truce into concrete \r\naction, the IOC established the International Olympic \r\nTruce Foundation, which is based in Athens. Its \r\nprogrammes lead to global support and observance of \r\nthe Olympic Truce and to the steady shaping of a \r\nculture of peace. To promote dialogue, the Foundation \r\nconducts the prestigious International Forum on Sport \r\nfor Peace and the Olympic Truce that meets biennially \r\nin Olympia.  \r\n Promoting such initiatives in favour of the \r\nOlympic Truce requires partnerships among the \r\nmembers of the Olympic family, international and \r\nnational organizations and non-governmental \r\norganizations that contribute to the cause of peace. \r\nAbove all, the Truce and its initiatives are those of the \r\npeople of the world for the people of the world.  \r\n The United States delegation recognizes and \r\nsupports opportunities such as today’s draft resolution \r\nfor building a peaceful and better world through sport \r\nand the Olympic ideal.  \r\n The Acting President: I should like to inform \r\nmembers that, immediately following the adjournment \r\nof this meeting, there will be an informal segment to \r\nhear a statement by the President of the International \r\nOlympic Committee.  \r\n Mr. Briz Gutiérrez (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Allow me to begin by thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report that forms the basis of today’s \r\ndebate, as contained in document A/62/325 and entitled \r\n“Sport for development and peace: progress and \r\nprospects”.  \r\n We also welcome the efforts of Mr. Adolf Ogi, \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, and his contribution to the \r\ndissemination of messages regarding the value of \r\nsports for development.  \r\n My delegation fully associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nPeru on behalf of the Group of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States regarding draft resolution A/62/L.2, \r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”. I should like to take this \r\nopportunity to make some specific comments on the \r\nbroader subject of sport for peace and development. \r\nThe Government of the Republic of Guatemala \r\nattaches great importance to that subject, because \r\nphysical activity for health as well as sport and \r\nrecreation in all their forms are considered a right of all \r\nGuatemalans.  \r\n Since the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and \r\nLasting Peace in 1996, the Ministry of Culture and \r\nSports has made every effort to contribute to its \r\nimplementation. That institution has aimed all of its \r\nprogrammes and activities at building a culture of \r\npeace based on the attitudes and values developed by \r\nGuatemalan society. Mindful of Guatemalan \r\nmulticulturalism, the Ministry seeks to strengthen \r\npeaceful coexistence through socio-cultural exchanges, \r\nrespect for differences, appreciation of creativity, \r\nsocial organization and links between human beings \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n11 07-57301 \r\n \r\nand between them and nature — all in a context of \r\nlong-term activities to promote peace and sustainable \r\nhuman development.  \r\n Recently, the Ministry of Culture and Sports, \r\ntogether with the Presidency of the Republic of \r\nGuatemala, has implemented a programme to bring \r\nrecreation to detention centres. The programme \r\nconsists of promoting sport as a means of social \r\nintegration, rehabilitation and equal opportunity. In \r\naddition, a social reintegration programme is aimed at \r\nindividuals and groups considered socially at risk: \r\nprisoners, members of street groups, child workers and \r\nrefugees, including handicapped members of such \r\ngroups.  \r\n Among the activities carried out with these \r\ngroups, we should mention schools for chess, training \r\nand recreation, aimed at juvenile delinquents; sport \r\nevents for street children, workers and shantytown \r\nresidents; national barrier-free games and a chess \r\nschool for the blind. There are also other initiatives \r\nthat involve recreational sports training schools, such \r\nas the “Peace Bowl” rural soccer championship and \r\nsports coaching for disabled persons, and programmes \r\nto exchange war toys for educational toys, supported \r\nby volunteers from civil society.  \r\n Furthermore, specific programmes have been \r\ndeveloped for children, young people and older adults. \r\nThe children’s programme provides children with sport \r\nand recreation opportunities through various activities \r\nenabling them to use free time in a healthful way. It \r\nencourages children to participate in sports such as \r\nathletics, basketball and soccer, and it seeks to promote \r\nmoral and social values through physical activities. \r\nThe main objective of the youth programme is to \r\npromote productive activity by young people through \r\nsports and to identify, support and strengthen youth \r\nleaders who can promote sports in their communities. \r\nThe programme for older adults, aimed at those aged \r\n50 and above, seeks to improve their quality of life \r\nthrough physical, recreational and cultural activities. It \r\nis worth noting that 75 per cent of those participating \r\nin this programme are women.  \r\n My delegation welcomed the entry into force of \r\nthe International Convention against Doping in Sport \r\non 1 February 2007 and wishes to report that it is \r\nalready under consideration by the Congress of the \r\nRepublic for approval. Likewise, Guatemala was also \r\npleased to have successfully hosted the 119th session \r\nof the International Olympic Committee in July. We are \r\ngrateful for the support of all those who participated, \r\nand we hope to see them in our country once again.  \r\n Furthermore, I wish to stress the need for \r\ncontinued efforts to fully incorporate sport and \r\nphysical education into development programmes. \r\nAppropriate assistance should also be given to \r\ndeveloping countries in order to mobilize the resources \r\nnecessary to improve sports infrastructures and \r\nfacilities, which benefit the health and wholesome \r\ndevelopment of children and young people.  \r\n I also wish to commend the work carried out in \r\ncollaboration with United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions and with the support of the International \r\nOlympic Committee. We are confident that such \r\ninitiatives and programmes will also be implemented \r\nwith the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \r\nto benefit the Haitian people.  \r\n In conclusion, my delegation reaffirms the \r\nimportance of implementing strategies that incorporate \r\nsport more effectively into various health, education, \r\ndevelopment and peace programmes at the local, \r\nnational, regional and global levels. In that connection, \r\nwe welcome the initiative of the Regional Bureau for \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, in collaboration with the \r\nUnited Nations New York Office of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace. The initiative is aimed at \r\nimplementing a programme in Central America to use \r\nsport as an instrument for the inclusion of young \r\npeople and the promotion of peace.  \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I am \r\nspeaking on behalf of Chile to express our support for \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.2, entitled “Building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, \r\njust introduced by Mr. Liu Qi, President of the Beijing \r\nOrganizing Committee for the Olympic Games. We are \r\nconvinced that sport is an effective vehicle for \r\npromoting not only peace and development, but also an \r\nenvironment of tolerance, dialogue and respect — \r\nwhich are so necessary in today’s world — in the spirit \r\nof the Olympic Truce.  \r\n I should like to recall that the link between sport \r\nand peace is not just theoretical. In the case of Haiti \r\nand the United Nations Mission in that country, it has \r\nhosted soccer teams from Brazil and Chile, impressing \r\non tens of thousands of Haitians the idea of solidarity \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 12 \r\n \r\nand peace through sport. We should have more such \r\noccasions.  \r\n On behalf of Chile, I should also like to say that \r\nwe received with great interest the report of the \r\nSecretary-General entitled “Sport for development and \r\npeace: progress and prospects” (A/62/325 and Corr.1), \r\nwhich describes the first year of implementation of the \r\nAction Plan, which we adopted some time ago. We are \r\noptimistic about the Plan, because we consider it an \r\nexcellent road map that will enable us not only to guide \r\nthe efforts of Governments, civil society and \r\nmultilateral organizations, but also to have a very \r\npositive impact through the expansion and \r\nstrengthening of plans and programmes being \r\nimplemented in all of our countries.  \r\n One problem that we find particularly worrisome \r\nderives from the relationship between sport and \r\nphysical health. According to international studies, \r\npeople who do not engage in physical exercise form a \r\nhigh-risk group with significantly higher mortality \r\nrates than people who exercise sufficiently.  \r\n For that reason, this draft resolution presented by \r\nChina, as well as others that will be presented soon, \r\nshould contribute to the implementation of public \r\npolicies to promote sport and physical education, \r\nderived from the creation of a worldwide culture of \r\nsport and physical education. This programme should \r\nbring together young people, adults and seniors; \r\nhandicapped athletes; men and women; inhabitants of \r\ndeveloped and developing countries — everyone \r\nshould come together to improve their quality of life \r\nand contribute to a less violent, healthier, more tolerant \r\nworld — all within the Olympic ideal.  \r\n Of course, promoting sporting activities and \r\nphysical education is the sovereign responsibility of \r\neach country. But at the multilateral level there is a \r\nneed for a permanent, sufficiently representative \r\nstructure to allow us to cooperate with national efforts. \r\nIn principle, we are pleased that the Office of the \r\nSecretary-General’s Special Adviser on Sport, \r\nDevelopment and Peace was established in Geneva, \r\nwith a liaison office in New York, under the \r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs. However, \r\nwe need such a structure to be established in a \r\npermanent way with sufficient financial resources to \r\nsuitably carry out its mandate. That financing should \r\nbe stable and predictable and should preferably come \r\nfrom the regular budget or from the donors community.  \r\n In a different but related context, we would like \r\nto congratulate the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nMr. Adolph Ogi, whose Office, together with other \r\nbodies, has taken a number of actions to promote sport \r\nand physical education; the New York Office has \r\njoined in these efforts in an outstanding way.  \r\n Finally, we believe it necessary to establish \r\nstrategic alliances among the United Nations, the \r\nprivate sector and civil society in order to mobilize \r\nresources and create national capacities. Here, \r\nfoundations, non-governmental organizations and \r\nsports federations have a central role to play. At the \r\nsame time, the United Nations should strengthen its \r\nties with international organizations such as the \r\nFédération internationale de football association \r\n(FIFA) and the International Olympic Committee.  \r\n As we promote sport, peace and development, we \r\nare facilitating the implementation of the \r\ninternationally agreed development objectives, \r\nincluding those of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nas my colleague from Benin has stated on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group. As a member of the Group of Friends \r\nof Sport for Development and Peace, Chile is satisfied \r\nwith the work the Group has done thus far, and will \r\ncontinue to work actively with other delegations as we \r\ntry to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.  \r\n Mr. Naik (India): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on “Sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment: progress and prospects” (A/62/325 and \r\nCorr.1). We note the well-organized structure and good \r\npresentation of information in the report, which \r\nprovides an overview of activities undertaken on \r\nvarious fronts by Member States, the United Nations \r\nsystem and other stakeholders. It also makes \r\nrecommendations for further action based on lessons \r\nlearned.  \r\n India supports the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to highlight the useful role that sport can play \r\nin consolidating peace and furthering development. \r\nSport is an easy and relatively inexpensive way of \r\nengaging the energies of youth in a positive and \r\nconstructive manner. It teaches the spirit of \r\nsportsmanship that generates tolerance of spirit and \r\naction and respect for the opponent. It also inculcates \r\ndiscipline through the observance of the rules of the \r\ngame. It develops camaraderie and good fellowship \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n13 07-57301 \r\n \r\nthat enhances the ability of communities to coexist \r\npeacefully.  \r\n The contribution of sport to furthering \r\ndevelopment is also recognized. A healthy mind lives \r\nin a healthy body. Sport provides physical activity, \r\nenhances oxygen intake and improves stamina. It \r\nbrings people together for a common purpose. Its \r\nenjoyable format provides a good vehicle for \r\npropagating difficult social messages. Sport improves \r\nproductivity and fosters social harmony and discipline. \r\nIndeed, sport can play a subtle, positive and \r\nconstructive role in development and peace.  \r\n India believes that activities related to sport and \r\nphysical education are a necessary component of \r\nhuman resource development. India has a long tradition \r\nof sport and physical education. Ancient Indian \r\nscriptures and literature describe the important place in \r\nprincely education of such sports as archery, weight-\r\nlifting and wrestling. A mastery over such sports was \r\nconsidered as important as the knowledge of scriptures. \r\nEducation in modern India is trying to continue and \r\nbuild upon this heritage and respect for sport and \r\nphysical education.  \r\n In view of the key role of sport and games in \r\nnational life, the Government of India has taken a \r\nnumber of initiatives to improve the standard of sport \r\nin the country. There is wide recognition of the need \r\nfor broad-basing sport and for the provision of modern \r\nsport infrastructure. The Government has made efforts \r\ntowards upgrading the skills of the coaching fraternity, \r\nthe creation of sport infrastructure and the construction \r\nof an adequate sport-science backup. Efforts are also \r\nbeing made to encourage national sport federations to \r\nmake their operations more effective and focused.  \r\n The involvement of society at large, particularly \r\nbusiness and industry, is adding to the efforts of the \r\nGovernment. To encourage sport and sportspersons, a \r\nnumber of prestigious awards are bestowed to \r\nrecognize their achievements. Several schemes have \r\nbeen put in place to propagate sport and to provide \r\nincentives for sporting activities. These include \r\nschemes such as the Sports Fund for Pension for \r\nMeritorious Sportspersons, as well as the Promotion of \r\nSports and Games in Schools programme.  \r\n While the welfare of young sportspersons is \r\ncovered by the Sport Scholarship Scheme, a National \r\nWelfare Fund has been established to assist retired \r\nsportspersons. A National Sports Development Fund \r\nhas been set up to mobilize resources. The Ministry of \r\nYouth Affairs and Sports in the Government of India \r\nrepresents sport at the national level. The Government \r\nhas also established the Sport Authority of India to \r\npursue the twin objectives of broad-basing sport and \r\nnurturing talent in children through the provision of \r\nnecessary infrastructure, equipment, coaching and \r\nother facilities. These include a Sports Medicine \r\nCentre and Dope Control Centre.  \r\n We agree with the Secretary-General on the need \r\nto enhance the use of sport to help reverse disease and \r\nobesity, especially among young people. The report \r\nmentions the role of sport in reversing the spread of \r\nHIV/AIDS. While sport may have only a limited role \r\nin this regard, the promotion of sport can play a more \r\ncritical role in reversing the growing trend of juvenile \r\ndiabetes in urban areas. Regular practice of a sport can \r\nalso help lower anxiety and high blood pressure caused \r\nby the pressures of modern living among the younger \r\ngeneration of today.  \r\n We note from the report of the Secretary-General \r\nthat despite uneven progress, there is evidence \r\nindicating a better integration of sport across all \r\ngeographical regions. However, the report points out \r\nthat the lack of adequate resources, facilities and \r\ntrained personnel continues to be a key constraint in \r\nmany countries. Developing countries have to deal \r\nwith enormous challenges with limited resources. \r\nThese challenges are even more daunting for the least \r\ndeveloped countries.  \r\n The complexion of sport has undergone a \r\ntransformation in the modern world. The pursuit of \r\nsport today requires the availability of modern and \r\nhighly sophisticated equipment, infrastructure and \r\ntraining. The ready availability of and easy access to \r\nsuch facilities in the developed world tilts the \r\ninternational sporting arena towards the developed \r\nworld. There is, thus, a solemn need for international \r\ncooperation and assistance for encouraging the \r\ndevelopment of sport infrastructure in developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n In this context, we agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendation to make sport and physical \r\neducation more accessible to larger segments of the \r\nworld’s population, especially to those who lack the \r\nopportunity and facilities. We also agree with the need \r\nto promote investment in the expansion of sports \r\ninfrastructure and facilities, including through \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 14 \r\n \r\nenhanced resources, sports sciences and sports \r\nmedicine programmes, particularly in the developing \r\nworld. We support the Secretary-General’s call for \r\ngreater efforts for promotion of sports and physical \r\neducation. That could include advocacy through \r\nparticipation in sports and non-sporting events. We are \r\nconvinced, however, that sporting activities themselves \r\nare the best advocacy tool for the promotion of sports. \r\nWe hope therefore that the United Nations system will \r\nfocus its efforts on promoting sports through sports \r\nthemselves, rather than through conferences and \r\nmeetings.  \r\n Sport is an inalienable part of the educational \r\nprocess and a factor for promoting peace, friendship, \r\ncooperation and understanding among peoples. We \r\nagree with the Secretary-General that sport and \r\nphysical education are not luxuries in society, and \r\nmuch less so in the developing world. We must \r\ntherefore invigorate our efforts for the promotion of \r\nsports for development and peace.  \r\n Mr. Mavroyiannis (Cyprus): Cyprus has had \r\nstrong links with the Olympic concept in modern as \r\nwell as ancient times — as matter of fact, since the \r\ninception of the Olympic Games in 776 B.C. — and I \r\nwish to make a few remarks.  \r\n At the outset, I would like to congratulate the \r\nChinese delegation for tabling resolution A/62/L.2, \r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal” and wish the Government \r\nof the People’s Republic of China, the host of the 2008 \r\nSummer Olympic Games, every success in that \r\nendeavour. I wish also to express appreciation for the \r\npresence here today of the President of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, Mr. Jacques Rogge, \r\nas well as other distinguished representatives of the \r\nOlympic movement, within the framework of \r\npromoting the Games and the preservation of the \r\nOlympic ideals, including fair play.  \r\n Sport, especially in the context of the Olympic \r\nGames, whether as an historical or contemporary \r\nconcept, is a momentous and perpetually relevant \r\nelement in all facets of human life and no less in our \r\nwork here at the United Nations.  \r\n Sport is an integral part of human development \r\nand well-being, both individual and collective. Its \r\ncontribution to development, capacity-building, unity \r\nand bringing people closer together has been evidenced \r\non many occasions. Often unnoticed, however, is the \r\npower of creating a culture of sport as an effective tool \r\nfor ethos-building among the youth of all our countries.  \r\n Also, the focus of our discussion today is how the \r\nconcept of sport, and the virtues it entails, relates to the \r\ncore human instincts of peace and security. Let us take \r\nthe tradition of the Olympic Truce as an example. The \r\ncessation of all hostilities before, during and after the \r\nOlympic Games in antiquity is a practice recalled and \r\nrevered as much today as it was then. So why are we \r\nthen unable today to cease hostilities on any grounds, \r\nincluding through the pursuit of sport, whose purpose \r\nis to remind us that humankind was created for pursuits \r\nmore noble than conflict?  \r\n If the ancients, with their limited means of \r\ndisseminating knowledge and information, were able to \r\nobserve such a truce, despite the immense difficulties, \r\nwhy can we not, with all the means we have to ensure \r\ncollective ethos and civilization and to protect human \r\nlife as our most valued possession, achieve at least as \r\nmuch by establishing a corresponding contemporary \r\npractice? The task of ensuring safe passage for athletes \r\nto reach the Games through the Olympic Truce might \r\nbe less pertinent now than in the past. But the biggest \r\ncontribution of that tradition has never been one of \r\npractical arrangements.  \r\n The creation of a peaceful environment, with the \r\nhope that this would have implications more lasting \r\nthan the duration of the Games themselves, was always \r\nconsubstantial to the Olympic ideal. More importantly, \r\ninherent in the tradition of the Olympic Truce, there \r\nhave always been three key messages: first, the futility \r\nof war, the denunciation of violence and subjugation, \r\nand the superiority of pursuits that bring people \r\ntogether; secondly, the quest for freedom, shared \r\nvalues, and the intrinsically noble character of fairness \r\nand synergy; and, thirdly, the recognition of their \r\ncontribution to the prosperity of all and to the further \r\ndevelopment of culture and civilization.  \r\n However, we should recognize that the content of \r\nthe draft resolution before us, to which we lend our \r\nsupport as we traditionally have done, has never been \r\nfully implemented in all its elements, despite its \r\nbiannual adoption and unanimous support. We hope \r\nthat its letter and spirit will gradually be embedded in \r\ninternational human custom and that its observance \r\nwill be one of those instances when history will repeat \r\nitself.  \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n15 07-57301 \r\n \r\n Mr. Noghès (Monaco) (spoke in French): A few \r\nmonths from now, the People’s Republic of China will \r\nbe hosting the twenty-ninth Olympic Games followed \r\nby the Paralympic Games. The Olympics are \r\ntraditionally the most widely followed sporting event \r\nthroughout the world and that is because they inspire \r\nall peoples in all their diversity to come together in \r\ntheir admiration for athletes who are doing their best in \r\npeaceful competition.  \r\n As was the case for the athletes who met at each \r\nOlympic Games since the forty-eighth session, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has revived the ancient Greek \r\ntradition of the Olympic Truce to recall the extent to \r\nwhich the Olympic ideal can and must be an example \r\nfor promoting peace and understanding among peoples. \r\nMonaco continues to co-sponsor with pride and \r\nconviction the draft resolution entitled “Building a \r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal” (A/62/L.2).  \r\n Sport brings together positive energies, when \r\npracticed with respect for effort and work, without \r\ncheating nor the use of stimulants or doping \r\nsubstances. In hosting his counterpart Ministers of \r\nSports on the occasion of the twelfth Games of the \r\nSmall States of Europe, our Minister of Sports, \r\nMr. Paul Masseron, Government Advisor for the \r\nMinistry of the Interior, stated that  \r\n “doping cannot be accepted, neither in high-level \r\nsports where it jeopardizes competition nor in \r\nindividual competition where it destroys the \r\nwhole educational thrust of sport, because doping \r\nis no longer today a question of level, age or \r\ndiscipline”.  \r\n Since 2003, the Principality of Monaco has had \r\nan antidoping committee that is involved in \r\nimplementing antidoping policies in keeping with the \r\nobjectives of the International Convention against \r\nDoping in Sport. Over 150 tests will be conducted in \r\nthe Principality this year. His Serene Highness, Prince \r\nAlbert II, former Olympic athlete and member of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, has been paying \r\nparticular attention to ethics in sports. We therefore \r\nwelcome the entry into force of the International \r\nConvention against Doping in Sport in February 2007.  \r\n With their breadth, the Olympic Games are a \r\nshowcase for 36 different sports. The sense of \r\nbrotherhood in sport is within everyone’s grasp. From \r\nrefugee camps to street children, from schools to \r\nbusiness firms, sports promote the development of the \r\nhuman being. \r\n A recognition of the humanist aspect of sport \r\nunderlay the signing of an agreement between our \r\nGovernment and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP) on 27 June 2007, setting up an \r\ninnovative programme on humanistic sport for the \r\ndevelopment of urban youth. Drawing on the \r\neducational values of humanist sport, the project is \r\ndesigned to contribute to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). It aims to reintegrate young people in \r\ndifficulty in disadvantaged areas. Cape Town, South \r\nAfrica, was chosen for this partnership with UNDP. \r\nThe establishment of a football training centre for \r\nyoung people is also being studied, along with literacy \r\nand professional training courses. \r\n Members know Prince Albert II’s commitment to \r\nthe protection of the environment. The host of the next \r\nGames is the city of Beijing, and we congratulate \r\nBeijing on its efforts at “greening” the Games, as \r\nreflected in the report of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme. Indeed, this is a phenomenal \r\ntask in terms of transport management, water \r\npurification, waste recycling and energy efficiency. \r\nNew urban centres, with a forested park of \r\n580 hectares, the use of solar energy — all of these are \r\nindispensable investments. \r\n Last June, the Principality of Monaco hosted the \r\ntwelfth Games of the Small States of Europe. Prince \r\nAlbert II wanted to ensure that this event was \r\necologically effective. Following the event, a \r\ndeclaration was adopted by the heads of State or \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra, the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, the Republic of Iceland, the \r\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein, the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg, the Republic of San Marino and the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco. The declaration recognized the \r\nimportant potential of sport as a vehicle for values and \r\na factor in the creation of a true ethic of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Secondly, it recognized that the sport \r\nmust be in harmony with the environment. Thirdly, it \r\nstated that the Games of the Small States of Europe \r\nmust respect the environment, and called in particular \r\nfor carbon-neutral Games in order to minimize their \r\nenvironmental impact. The organizing country would \r\ncommit itself to compensate for greenhouse gas \r\nemissions and any other negative impact relating to the \r\nGames or their preparation, through such initiatives to \r\nprotect the environment as it deems most appropriate. \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 16 \r\n \r\nFinally, the signatories stated the intention to develop \r\nin their respective countries environmental awareness \r\nbased on a spirit of solidarity and leading to \r\nenvironmentally friendly behaviour. At the initiative of \r\nthe Prince Albert II Foundation, it was decided to \r\nmeasure the greenhouse gas impact of the Games and \r\nto reduce it by all means possible. Monaco will offset \r\nthis, including by planting trees. \r\n Mr. Rogachev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Sport, peace and development are closely \r\ninterconnected. The absence of war is a precondition \r\nfor sporting competition. Sporting competition is not a \r\nstruggle between enemies, but rather a competition \r\namong partners in their common aspiration for \r\ndevelopment. In this period of globalization, when the \r\nworld is facing new challenges and threats and when it \r\nis necessary to have a dialogue between civilizations, \r\nwe are convinced that international cooperation in the \r\narea of sport can play an important role in overcoming \r\nnational and religious enmity and in bringing together \r\nthe world community. \r\n The role of sport as an ambassador of peace is \r\nparticularly significant when linked to the noble \r\ntraditions of the Olympic Truce. It is necessary to \r\ninculcate in future generations a spirit of the culture of \r\npeace, non-violence and tolerance, showing that the \r\nOlympic ideal is not out of date and is still significant. \r\n In this connection, Russia has sponsored and \r\nfully supports draft resolution A/62/L.2 on building a \r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal, and we call on all to observe this \r\nOlympic Truce.  \r\n The flame of the Olympic torch should light the \r\nway, leading humankind into the third millennium: a \r\nbeacon indicating a world without enmity and violence. \r\nNext year, this flame of peace will illuminate the \r\nancient city of Beijing, the host of the 2008 summer \r\nOlympic Games. We sincerely wish our Chinese \r\ncolleagues every success in organizing this global \r\nevent. \r\n Seven years from now, the Olympic baton will be \r\npassed to the Russian city of Sochi, which will host the \r\nWinter Olympic and Paralympic Games. We are \r\nconvinced that the Olympics to be held in our country \r\nwill provide a significant impetus to the Olympic \r\nMovement and strengthen the values of a healthy \r\nlifestyle. At present, Sochi is building the most modern \r\nsporting facilities and is working at full steam to \r\nimprove its infrastructure so as to ensure the success of \r\nthis major event. \r\n Russia highly values the activities of the United \r\nNations in enhancing international cooperation in sport \r\nand confirming the ideals of the sporting movement \r\nthroughout the world. We welcome the joint initiative \r\nof the United Nations and the International Olympic \r\nCommittee (IOC) to promote the inclusion of sport and \r\nphysical education in programmes in the fields of \r\neducation, health, environmental protection, combating \r\nhunger and improving the status of women. \r\n We believe that support for sport, including at the \r\npolitical level, may help countries achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We welcome \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on sport (A/62/325 \r\nand Corr.1). A very important role here falls to \r\nMr. Adolf Ogi, Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace. We are \r\nready to continue our fruitful cooperation with the \r\nSpecial Adviser, and we support the ongoing activities \r\nof the New York-based United Nations Office of Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace, headed by Mr. Djibril \r\nDiallo. \r\n Sport is a universal language, thanks to which \r\ncompetitors come from many countries, cultures and \r\nfaiths. We can thus talk about the significant potential \r\nof sport for diplomacy as a way of ensuring a channel \r\nto promote a culture of peace and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. Pierre de Coubertin said that sport was an \r\nambassador of peace and a reliable bridge of friendship \r\nand mutual understanding between peoples. We must \r\nmake full use of its potential. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nFirst of all, my delegation would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report entitled “Sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace: progress and prospects” \r\n(A/62/325 and Corr.1). It gives us an overall \r\nassessment of the progress achieved over the past year \r\non the national, regional and international levels in \r\nimplementing strategies and programmes on sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace. \r\n As noted in the report, sport has great potential in \r\nmaking a substantive contribution to enhancing peace \r\nand achieving development goals, as formulated in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\nincreasing role of sport in achieving international \r\nagreement in the field of development, including the \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n17 07-57301 \r\n \r\nMDG targets, was reaffirmed by heads of State or \r\nGovernment at the 2005 World Summit. \r\n In this context, we certainly value the measures \r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General in implementing \r\nthe Action Plan intended to expand and strengthen \r\nUnited Nations partnerships with Governments, sport-\r\nrelated organizations and the private sector. The \r\nparticipation today by the President of the International \r\nOlympic Committee (IOC), Mr. Rogge, in the \r\nconsideration of this particular item, underscores the \r\nfact that this Organization of ours and all of its \r\nstructures are actively working with this most \r\nprestigious sporting organization on a global level.  \r\n The delegation of Kazakhstan welcomes the entry \r\ninto force on 1 February 2007 of the International \r\nConvention against Doping in Sport. We believe that \r\nthe Convention will make a very significant \r\ncontribution to preventing the use of doping in sport, \r\nand will do a lot to eradicate it. In this connection, we \r\nwould like to note that an anti-doping laboratory for \r\nsports has begun operation, and in 2007 in Kazakhstan \r\nit was given full laboratory status from the World Anti-\r\nDoping Agency.  \r\n Kazakhstan welcomes the activities of the Special \r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace and notes the importance of \r\nsport in achieving the goals of development and peace.  \r\n We would also like to note with satisfaction a \r\nglobal summit of young leaders held last year in New \r\nYork under the auspices of the United Nations, which \r\nmade possible a discussion on the important questions \r\nof propagating sport and mobilizing future youth \r\nleaders.  \r\n As we know, sport and physical education are an \r\nimportant way of teaching tolerance and a culture of \r\npeace, and also of bringing people closer together. In \r\nthis connection, the delegation of Kazakhstan \r\nwelcomes the activities of the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser and the Information Centres of the United \r\nNations aimed at propagating the idea of sport as an \r\ninstrument for development and peace, and also the \r\nmeasures undertaken to enhance the role of sport in \r\nbuilding peace.  \r\n On behalf of our delegation, I would like to thank \r\nthe delegation of China for its draft resolution on peace \r\nand building a better life on the planet through sport, \r\nand the implementation of Olympic sporting ideals. In \r\nthis connection, Kazakhstan is one of the Members of \r\nthe United Nations that co-sponsored this resolution \r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport \r\nand the Olympic ideal” (A/62/L.2). Of course, \r\nKazakhstan will be most pleased to be participating in \r\nthe twenty-ninth Olympic Games in a neighbouring \r\ncountry, and we have already been taking all of the \r\nnecessary steps to ensure that we have as many spots \r\nas possible for our participants in these Olympic \r\nGames. We certainly hope that we will win a good \r\nnumber of medals as well.  \r\n Kazakhstan has been taking comprehensive \r\nmeasures to make use of sport to the benefit of peace. \r\nIn December 2006 a Presidential decree confirmed our \r\nState’s programme to develop physical education and \r\nsport in Kazakhstan for the years 2007 thru 2011. The \r\nprogramme calls for a set of measures aimed at \r\nensuring participation in physical education and sport \r\nis as broad as possible, in particular among young \r\npeople. This is important for improving their health, \r\nensuring that we have many skilled athletes and for \r\nbringing our sportsmen up to the international level.  \r\n We are working to bring disabled persons into \r\nsports as well. A club of disabled sportsmen is \r\noperative in every region. In the south of Kazakhstan, \r\nwe held our second Paralympic Games, with over 500 \r\nsports participants from all regions of the country. \r\nConsiderable work has been done to develop boarding \r\nschools for children gifted in sports, regional Olympic-\r\nlevel training centres and Republican Schools for \r\nsports excellence. We would like to note that just this \r\nyear, the Republic organized and held over 10,000 \r\nevents on healthy-lifestyles, involving the participation \r\nof over 1.5 million people.  \r\n In 2011, Kazakhstan will be the host of the \r\nseventh Asian Winter Games, and active work is being \r\ndone in our country today for holding this very \r\nimportant event. The appropriate Ministry has already \r\nengaged in negotiations with leading international \r\narchitects. We have called for bids for building \r\nfacilities near Almaty, and we are designating areas for \r\nthese sports facilities. The overall expenditure will \r\nreach $1 billion.  \r\n Thus, my delegation believes that we must \r\nmaintain the dynamism set by the United Nations and \r\ncontinue that educational path in implementing broader \r\nmeasures as well. This is something that we can do to \r\nenhance the cooperation and coordination between \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 18 \r\n \r\nMember States in order to come up with a general \r\nvision for the development of sport to benefit peace \r\nthroughout the world.  \r\n Mr. Mourikis (Greece): It is a great honour for \r\nme to take the floor on agenda item 45 (b) in order to \r\nexpress my country’s wholehearted support for draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.2.  \r\n Four years ago, Greece presented a similar \r\nresolution as it was preparing for the 2004 Athens \r\nOlympics. This year, it is China’s turn to keep the \r\ntradition and table a resolution urging Member States \r\nto observe, within the framework of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Olympic Truce during the twenty-\r\nninth Olympic Games and Paralympic Games to be \r\nheld in Beijing. The wide support extended to this \r\nyear’s resolution stresses the international community’s \r\nrecognition for the principles it embodies and our \r\ncommon goal: to celebrate the Games in peace, \r\nharmony and friendship. We wish China every success \r\nin organizing the Olympic Games.  \r\n In bringing the idea of the Olympic Truce to the \r\nforefront, we encourage the notion that it is possible to \r\ncreate lasting peace from a pause in hostilities. That is, \r\nin fact, how the Olympic Games were conceived in the \r\nfirst place. In antiquity, the implementation of the \r\nOlympic Truce entailed a cessation of all hostilities in \r\norder to allow the athletes and spectators to travel to \r\nand from Olympia to attend this sacred celebration of \r\nhuman achievement.  \r\n In today’s world the message could not be more \r\nrelevant. We strive for dialogue among civilizations \r\nand cooperation among the rich and the poor, yet \r\neveryday we witness our shortcomings. The Olympic \r\nTruce could be a constructive new approach to help \r\nresolve conflicts. The Olympic ideal speaks the \r\nuniversal language of peace, in which all peoples can \r\ncommunicate and share in its values.  \r\n The United Nations and the Olympic movement \r\nare natural allies. They share the same goals and \r\nobserve the same principles. They are useful tools in \r\nthe hands of the international community. It is up to us, \r\nthe Member States, to seize the opportunity presented \r\nby this resolution and to observe the Truce for the \r\nbenefit of our peoples. We express our appreciation and \r\nsupport to the International Olympic Committee for its \r\ntireless efforts to promote the Olympic Ideal and build \r\nbridges of understanding and cooperation.  \r\n Let me stress once again that by adopting, today, \r\nthe resolution entitled “Building a peaceful and better \r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal” we take a \r\npositive stance towards life and reality, without any \r\nillusions. We simply state the obvious: that if we can \r\nhave peace in the world for just 16 days, then maybe \r\nwe can have it for much longer. \r\n Before concluding, may I thank former Governor \r\nPataki for his reference to the recent fires at the ancient \r\nsites of Olympia. Indeed, the world witnessed \r\nextraordinary human achievement, and I can assure the \r\nAssembly that Olympic torch will ignite again in \r\nOlympia before embarking on its long trip to Beijing.  \r\n Mr. Khalfallah (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like to start by congratulating the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his report entitled “Sport for development \r\nand peace: progress and prospects” (A/62/235 and \r\nCorr.1), the title of which, by itself, carries hope and \r\ngreat significance for the future of sport as an activity \r\nthat the United Nations is comprehensively supporting. \r\n Tunisia would also like to express its gratitude to \r\nMr. Adolf Ogi, Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace, for all \r\nhis efforts and for his activities to ensure the success of \r\nprogrammes to promote sport throughout the world and \r\nfor the benefit of all.  \r\n Tunisia fully endorses the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Benin on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States and reaffirms its determination \r\nto continue its work to make sport an activity that \r\nbrings peoples together and a factor for world peace \r\nand stability — two essential goals of our \r\nOrganization.  \r\n Solidarity among peoples at the beginning of the \r\ntwenty-first century is not a mere option; it is a \r\nnecessity that, we are convinced, sport is capable of \r\nbringing to fruition. We support Mr. Ogi’s activities to \r\npromote, in the words of the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, “a common road map and coherent framework \r\nfor action to build global partnerships around sport and \r\nphysical education” (A/62/325, para. 72).  \r\n Indeed, our President, Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben \r\nAli, decided to dedicate an entire year to physical \r\neducation, in accordance with the Assembly’s launch of \r\nthe International Year of Sport and Physical Education \r\n2005 (see resolution 59/10), during which the world \r\ncelebrated sport through a broad range of diverse and \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n19 07-57301 \r\n \r\nuniformly important activities, thereby highlighting the \r\nimportance unanimously attach to sport and to the \r\nuniversal nature of this activity. Our duty is now to \r\npress on in this respect and to confirm that this was the \r\ncorrect choice, to which increasing resources are being \r\nallocated by everyone.  \r\n It is beyond dispute that sport today is of growing \r\ninterest to the international community. This is seen in \r\nthe vast number of sporting events, discussion forums \r\nand activities to popularize sports that have given rise \r\nto an international awareness that favours the role of \r\nsport as a fundamental support for the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Sport is also a \r\nsymbol of cooperation and of healthy, constructive \r\nfriendship. \r\n By sponsoring draft resolution A/62/L.2, entitled \r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport \r\nand the Olympic ideal”, Tunisia expresses once again \r\nits full commitment to the Olympic ideal. We remain \r\nconvinced that the forthcoming Olympic Games in \r\nBeijing will be a complete success and a sporting and \r\nmoral victory for all participants. \r\n Tunisia is very pleased to note the Secretariat \r\nproposal regarding a fund for sport for development \r\nand peace and hopes that, once it is finalized, all the \r\narrangements will allow for the effective \r\nimplementation of the objectives we have set. \r\nMoreover, we are convinced that the formal \r\nestablishment of the Office of the Special Adviser will \r\nhelp to promote the activities undertaken in the sphere \r\nof sport for development and peace and will prove to \r\nbe a most valuable asset for the United Nations, which \r\nwill thus have a tool to bring people together in a \r\nworld that thirsts for dialogue, mutual understanding \r\nand tolerance.  \r\n The presence here of the President of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, the President of the \r\nBeijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the \r\nXXIX Olympiad and the Special Adviser for Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace shows the scope and \r\nimportance that sport has acquired and the need to \r\nensure that this activity is supported by all. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): Allow me to congratulate \r\nMr. Kerim on his leadership of the Assembly and to \r\nthank him for convening this important joint debate. \r\n Israel is proud to lend its support to draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.2, entitled “Building a peaceful and \r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”. \r\nSimilarly, we welcome the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, entitled “Sport for development and peace: \r\nprogress and prospects” (A/62/325 and Corr.1), which \r\nsummarizes the steps taken during the first year of the \r\nthree-year road map to implement sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace programmes. \r\n Sport offers a common language that speaks of \r\ninternational friendship and harmony and that can \r\nbridge the global seams of friction. The spirit of \r\nhealthy competition provides a channel through which \r\npeople of different religious, cultural, racial and \r\npolitical backgrounds can interact and enhance their \r\nrespect for one another. \r\n Within the context of the United Nations, as the \r\nSecretary-General’s report shows, sport contributes to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and \r\npeace, by raising awareness and promoting values of \r\ncooperation and mutual understanding. No doubt, using \r\nsport as a universal focal point for interaction will bear \r\nfruit in the promotion of education, health, \r\ndevelopment and peace. \r\n In our region, we have tried to harness the spirit \r\nof sport to forge relationships and build bridges across \r\nthe dark waters of conflict. We hope that these types of \r\ncompetitions will continue to develop and expand in \r\nthe future. Israel has a visibly active network of \r\norganizations that sponsor sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment days and that bring children — Jews and \r\nArabs, Israelis and Palestinians — together under the \r\numbrella of sport. A number of sport for peace \r\nprogrammes and festivals occur regularly; notable \r\namong them are those sponsored by the Peres Center \r\nfor Peace, founded by our current President, Shimon \r\nPeres. These sport and competition days emphasize \r\nteamwork and cooperation, alongside fostering \r\ncommonalities and sharing. \r\n Similarly, the legendary story of Sons of Sakhnin \r\nUnited, a multi-ethnic Israeli soccer team comprising \r\nJews, Arabs and others, and its quest to win the \r\nPremier League in Israel, continues to inspire hope and \r\nconfidence in the capacity for sport and competition to \r\ninculcate respect and mutual understanding. This year, \r\nthe prominence and power of this Cinderella story was \r\nbrought to wide attention with the release of a \r\ndocumentary film on the subject and its appearance in \r\ninternationally recognized film festivals. \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 20 \r\n \r\n Sons of Sakhnin United embodies the message of \r\nsport as a medium for peace and understanding in \r\nanother modality as well. The team plays in a stadium \r\nwidely known around the country as the Doha Stadium, \r\nwhich was built with public funds largely from the \r\nState of Israel and the Qatar National Olympic \r\nCommittee. This joint venture between Israel and Qatar \r\nis a sign of the quest for peaceful and neighbourly \r\nrelations within our region and the willingness to cross \r\nboundaries to achieve peace and harmony through \r\nsport. The Sons of Sakhnin United team, as we speak, \r\nholds the third position in Israel’s top soccer league. \r\n Unfortunately, not all sporting events are carried \r\nout with the same positivity. Although it is a painful \r\npart of our history, it is also worth remembering what \r\nhappened at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, when \r\ngunmen from the terrorist group Black September, \r\ndisguised as athletes, broke into the Olympic Village \r\nand killed 11 Israeli athletes, coaches and referees. The \r\nreverberations of that abhorrent and monstrous act of \r\nterrorism are felt in Israel — and around the world, for \r\nthat matter — to this very day. \r\n In that regard, we hope that the upcoming \r\nsummer Olympic Games, to be held in Beijing next \r\nyear, will adhere to the values of sport as an ideal way \r\nto stimulate body, mind and spirit, and in turn \r\novercome barriers of language, politics and religion. \r\nThe abuse of sport and international competition for \r\npolitical purposes is an affront to the very ethos and \r\nvirtues of the Olympic tradition. \r\n On the other hand, we know that sport can be \r\nutilized for great good. Just two weeks ago, the Israeli \r\ndelegation to the 2007 Special Olympics, held in \r\nShanghai, returned home from the games with \r\ntremendous pride and in high spirits. The Special \r\nOlympics prove to the world that determination, will \r\nand faith in one’s abilities can overcome any \r\nlimitation, regardless of the challenge. The resilience \r\nand commitment of those athletes should inspire us to \r\nutilize sport as an expression of the boundlessness of \r\nthe human potential. \r\n While sport has the power to bring people \r\ntogether, it alone cannot foster enduring peace. \r\nSupporting factors — such as an interest in peace \r\namong different groups, media involvement, strong \r\nparticipation by civil society and dedication by sport \r\norganizations — are needed if sport is to be an \r\neffective vehicle of peace. Israel strongly believes that \r\nto be true. We call on the nations of the world to use \r\nthe opportunities provided by sport to foster peace and \r\ndevelopment, and to continue promoting those \r\nsupporting factors to ensure the widest possible appeal. \r\nIsrael pledges itself to fully support such endeavours. \r\n Mr. Seakamela (South Africa): We thank \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the General Assembly, \r\nfor organizing today’s debate on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on sport for peace and development \r\n(A/62/325 and Corr.1). We also wish to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for that \r\ncomprehensive report. \r\n Since its establishment, the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace has made significant strides \r\ntowards the attainment of the objective of utilizing \r\nsport as a tool for development and peace. South Africa \r\ncommends the work of the Office in New York and \r\nGeneva. Both offices have contributed to the \r\nadvancement of advocacy work within the United \r\nNations system and beyond aimed at promoting \r\nunderstanding and support for sport as a tool for \r\ndevelopment and peace. \r\n South Africa is committed to the objectives \r\nrelated to the use of sport as a tool for development \r\nand peace. As a member of the New York-based Group \r\nof Friends of Sport for Development and Peace, we \r\nhave worked with others to encourage Member States \r\nto actively integrate sport into their international \r\ncooperation and development policies through the \r\nimplementation of relevant United Nations resolutions. \r\n My delegation believes that sport provides a \r\nforum in which to learn skills and discipline, \r\nconfidence and leadership, and that it teaches core \r\nprinciples, such as tolerance, cooperation and respect. \r\nOur leaders have persistently highlighted the potential \r\nthat sport has in building social cohesion and national \r\nreconstruction and unity. In this connection, we \r\nremember how our nation was bound together in joy \r\nwhen we won the Rugby World Cup in 1995 and the \r\nAfrican Soccer Cup of Nations in 1996, and more \r\nrecently when we won the Rugby World Cup for the \r\nsecond time, earlier this year. \r\n South Africa has also partnered and adopted \r\nmeasures, in compliance with General Assembly \r\nresolutions on sport for development and peace. In this \r\ncontext, since 2004 we have conducted the Siyadlala \r\nCommunity Mass Participation Programme and the \r\n A/62/PV.40\r\n \r\n21 07-57301 \r\n \r\nSchool Sport Mass Participation Programme. In \r\naddition, our country has partnered with other \r\ncountries such as Angola, Australia, China, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and others in \r\nthe area of sport for development and peace. We have \r\nalso ratified the UNESCO International Convention \r\nagainst Doping in Sport. \r\n South Africa is honoured to have been awarded \r\nthe rights to host the Féderation internationale de \r\nfootball association (FIFA) World Cup in 2010. This is \r\nthe first time that this global game is being hosted on \r\nthe African continent. The tournament is an important \r\nmilestone for the entire continent, and we believe it \r\nprovides our country, the region and the continent with \r\na golden opportunity to boost our sport and tourism \r\nindustries. The 2010 World Cup tournament can help \r\nadvance our economic development to a higher notch \r\nand fast-track the attainment of elements of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n The African Union (AU) has declared 2007 the \r\nInternational Year of African Football, underscoring \r\nthe United Nations view that sport can be an \r\ninstrument to promote unity, solidarity and peace. In \r\nthis context, the AU collaborated with the South \r\nAfrican Government and the New York Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace \r\non the activities for the International Year of African \r\nFootball, as well as for the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nConfederation of African Football and the lead-up to \r\nthe 2010 World Cup. \r\n My delegation expresses its appreciation for the \r\ncontribution made by the New York Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace \r\nin shaping the concept, activities and innovative \r\napproaches of the International Year of African \r\nFootball, which was launched at the eighth Summit of \r\nAfrican Union Heads of State, held in Addis Ababa in \r\nJanuary 2007. The Office’s active participation in the \r\ntechnical workshop for the 2010 FIFA World Cup \r\nAfrican Legacy Programme, which was held in Pretoria \r\nin March of this year, and in the first ministerial \r\nmeeting of Ministers of Sport and Youth, which was \r\nheld in Addis Ababa, was instrumental in enhancing \r\nthe momentum of using sport as a tool for development \r\nand peace. \r\n South Africa supports the efforts of the Office of \r\nSport for Development and Peace focusing on the role \r\nof sport in peacebuilding activities. In this context, we \r\nunderline the importance of strengthening the sporting \r\nprogrammes that were launched in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and in Liberia, in partnership \r\nwith United Nations peacekeeping missions in those \r\ncountries, and supported by other partners. We \r\nwelcome the commencement of similar projects in \r\nother countries, such as Lebanon and Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n In recognition of the progress made thus far in \r\nthe area of sport for development and peace, it is \r\nimportant that we build on past success and establish \r\nmore sustainable progress. In this context, we \r\nencourage the broader international community and, in \r\nparticular, the United Nations system to provide \r\nsupport in promoting sport as a tool for achieving \r\npeace and development. \r\n In conclusion, South Africa supports the draft \r\nresolution (A/62/L.2) introduced by the delegation of \r\nChina. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the Observer State of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): The role of \r\nsport within and among societies can be traced to some \r\nof the earliest civilizations. However, never before has \r\nthe practice of sport become as firmly established as it \r\nis today. Sport has become a mass phenomenon \r\ncapable of engaging huge crowds on a grand scale, \r\nbreaking down geographic, racial, social, economic, \r\npolitical and cultural barriers. \r\n Next year, the global community will once again \r\ncome together to celebrate the ancient tradition of the \r\nOlympic Games in its twenty-ninth modern edition, to \r\nbe held in Beijing. As the world prepares for that \r\nimportant event, we are reminded of the role that sport \r\ncan play in the life of every individual and society. \r\n Citius, altius, fortius: those three Latin words, \r\nused a century ago by Father Henri Martin Dideon to \r\ndescribe his students’ achievements in sport, were \r\nadopted as the Olympic motto because the aspiration to \r\nbe “swifter, higher, stronger” aptly describes the goals \r\nof great athletes all over the world. \r\n Sport practiced in a healthy and harmonious way \r\nis a means of bringing together peoples of different \r\ncultures and traditions in a respectful and peaceful \r\nmanner. Through the greater use of sport as dialogue \r\nand encounter, the Greek tradition of the Olympic \r\nTruce can give way to genuine and long-lasting peace. \r\nA/62/PV.40  \r\n \r\n07-57301 22 \r\n \r\n In fact, dialogue and encounter through sport \r\nhold great potential in the area of peacebuilding and \r\nconflict prevention. While the rule of law and justice \r\nremain the foundations of durable peace, sport \r\nprovides a tool enabling warring factions to come \r\ntogether for a common purpose. Such moments of \r\nunity may be brief and at times fleeting; nonetheless, \r\nthey are an important reminder that, in human \r\nexperience, there are many more things that bind us \r\ntogether than there are things that tear us apart. In that \r\nregard, my delegation notes with appreciation the work \r\nof the United Nations New York Office of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace to foster such dialogue in \r\nconflict-ridden places such as the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo and Liberia. We look forward to seeing \r\ngreater consolidation of its activity. \r\n In addition to fomenting dialogue across cultures \r\nand fostering peace, sport can serve as a means for \r\ngreater personal and social development. Through \r\nsport, people develop creativity and talent, overcome \r\npersonal challenges, acquire a sense of belonging and \r\nsolidarity and learn discipline and a sense of sacrifice. \r\nThose values redound to the benefit of the greater \r\ncommunity and help us understand the value of the \r\ncommon good over personal glory. Thus, we encourage \r\nsports figures to be models for youth and to help foster \r\nthe positive values of sport. \r\n Today’s society has seen an increasing number of \r\ncases of abuse and deviance in the practice of sport, \r\nwhich lead to a sport culture devoid of human values. \r\nHowever, the world of sport continues to have \r\nauthentic role models and generous protagonists who \r\nstrive to reclaim the ideal of sport as a real school of \r\nhumanity, camaraderie, solidarity and excellence. A \r\nrenewed and widely shared emphasis on a human-\r\ncentred approach to sport would help ensure that the \r\nimportant virtues learned through sport become one of \r\nthe means for developing and fostering healthy and \r\nresponsible human interaction. \r\n The Holy See’s Office for Church and Sports was \r\ncreated with that ideal of sport in mind. It works with \r\nschools, youth groups, amateur sport associations and \r\nathletic professionals to promote a healthy approach to \r\nsport and to help young people understand the positive \r\nimpact that sport values can have on both the local and \r\nglobal communities. \r\n The Olympic creed reminds us that the most \r\nimportant thing in life is not triumph, but struggle. \r\nMay the 2008 Olympic Games contribute to the \r\ncommon struggle to make the world a better place for \r\none and all through the promotion of the inseparable \r\nand mutually reinforcing values of peace, development \r\nand full respect for basic human rights. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 45 and its \r\nsub-items (a) and (b). Before proceeding to take action \r\non draft resolution A/62/L.2, I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the introduction of the draft resolution, the \r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Belize, the \r\nGambia, Honduras, Lithuania and Zambia. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.2, entitled “Building a peaceful and \r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal” \r\nunder sub-item (b) of agenda item 45. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.2? \r\n Draft resolution A/62/L.2 was adopted (resolution \r\n62/4). \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n45 and its sub-items (a) and (b). \r\n Before I adjourn the meeting, and as announced \r\nearlier, I would like to invite members to remain seated \r\nfor the informal segment after the adjournment of this \r\nmeeting, to hear the President of the International \r\nOlympic Committee. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n"
