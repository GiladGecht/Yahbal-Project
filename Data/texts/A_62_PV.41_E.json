(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 167 \r\n \r\nPeace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.4) \r\n \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea to introduce draft resolution A/62/L.4. \r\n Mr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): I have the honour to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.4, entitled “Peace, security and \r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula”. \r\n The inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang from \r\n2 to 4 October 2007 witnessed the adoption of the \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. The second of \r\nits kind since the year 2000, the summit provided an \r\nimportant opportunity to begin a new phase for peace, \r\ncommon prosperity and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula, by taking inter-Korean relations to a higher \r\nstage through the Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000 \r\nand the spirit of “by our nation itself”. \r\n The draft resolution welcomes and supports the \r\ninter-Korean summit, including its adoption of the \r\nDeclaration, and encourages both sides to implement it \r\nscrupulously and in good faith. The draft also invites \r\nMember States to support and assist the current, \r\npositive process. \r\n The adoption of the draft resolution will further \r\ncontribute to the achievement of durable peace and \r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula and peace and \r\nstability in the rest of the world. Therefore, I hope that \r\nit will be adopted by consensus.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea to also \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/62/L.4.  \r\n Mr. Kim Hyun Chong (Republic of Korea): \r\nThank you, Mr. President, for giving me this \r\nopportunity to introduce the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Peace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula”. Issued as a document of the General \r\nAssembly under the symbol A/62/L.4, the draft \r\nresolution was jointly prepared and submitted by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea. \r\n The inter-Korean summit was held from 2 to \r\n4 October 2007 in Pyongyang, where President Roh \r\nMoo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong Il adopted the \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. While \r\nreconfirming the commitment to peace and prosperity, \r\nwhich are consistent with the principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, that unique Declaration sets \r\nforth a paradigm that is intended to have salutary \r\neffects on future inter-Korean relations. The \r\nDeclaration calls for both Koreas to work towards \r\nestablishing a peace regime on the Korean peninsula, \r\nand this notion is consistent with the Korean peoples’ \r\nethos, which contemplates eventual reunification. To \r\nA/62/PV.41  \r\n \r\n07-57313 2 \r\n \r\nobviate military altercations, President Roh Moo-hyun \r\nand his counterpart agreed to set up a peace zone in the \r\nWest Sea and explored the feasibility of designating the \r\narea as a common fisheries zone. \r\n At the summit, both President Roh and Chairman \r\nKim expressed their commitment to denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula. This intention is reflected \r\nunequivocally in the Declaration, which calls on both \r\nsides to implement fully the 19 September Joint \r\nDeclaration and the 13 February Agreement of the Six-\r\nParty Talks, so as to resolve the nuclear issue. \r\n In tandem with the inter-Korean summit, the most \r\nrecent round of the Six-Party Talks, held in Beijing, \r\nconcluded on 3 October. At these talks, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea expressed its intention to \r\ndisable its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. The \r\ndynamics of the two meetings indicate that the Six-\r\nParty Talks and inter-Korean relations are progressing \r\nin a mutually reinforcing manner. Significant progress \r\nwas also made in the economic and trade area. \r\n The Gaeseong Industrial Complex, which is \r\nlocated in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand employs some 18,000 local workers, will be \r\nupgraded to accommodate further investments. The \r\ncreation of an additional industrial complex in the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is also being \r\ncontemplated. To further economic development, the \r\nGaeseong-Sinuiju railway, and the Gaeseong-\r\nPyongyang expressway in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea will be improved for common use \r\nby both Koreas. \r\n On the culture front, the two Koreas will \r\ncooperate closely at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. \r\n Through its various provisions, the Declaration \r\npoints the way forward for common prosperity, \r\neventual peaceful reunification in the Korean peninsula \r\nand the resolution of longstanding regional concerns. \r\n The Republic of Korea firmly believes that the \r\ninter-Korean summit and the resulting Declaration are \r\npositive developments, not only for both Koreas, but \r\nalso for the international community as a whole. \r\n It was exactly seven years ago today that the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted its resolution 55/11 under \r\nthe same agenda item, welcoming and supporting the \r\nJune 2000 inter-Korean summit and its joint \r\ndeclaration. I am confident that on this very special day \r\nMember States will once again demonstrate their \r\nsupport for advancing inter-Korean relations and peace \r\nand prosperity on the Korean peninsula by adopting the \r\ndraft resolution by consensus. \r\n Mr. Salgueiro (Portugal): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\ncandidate countries Turkey, Croatia, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nEuropean Free Trade Association Liechtenstein and \r\nNorway, the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, as \r\nwell as Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia align \r\nthemselves with this declaration. \r\n The European Union is following with keen \r\ninterest all efforts to reduce tension on the Korean \r\npeninsula. Accordingly, the EU supports any initiative \r\nconducive to the fostering of peace, stability and \r\ncooperation on the peninsula — namely, the adoption \r\nof a resolution by the United Nations General \r\nAssembly on peace, security and reunification on the \r\nKorean peninsula. \r\n The EU fully supported the summit between \r\nPresident Roh Moo-hyun and General Secretary Kim \r\nJong Il, held in Pyongyang on 2 to 4 October, as well \r\nas the outcome of this summit — the Declaration on \r\nthe Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, \r\nPeace and Prosperity — and considers that it has \r\ncontributed to the reinforcement of a growing \r\natmosphere of confidence and trust on the Korean \r\npeninsula. In turn, the EU believes that this atmosphere \r\nwill contribute to efforts within the framework of the \r\nSix-Party Talks, a process fully supported by the EU, \r\nto achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula. \r\n Furthermore, the European Union looks forward \r\nto the follow-up to this initiative, starting with the \r\nmeeting between the Prime Ministers of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea, which will take place in November. \r\nThe EU stands ready to contribute to the process of \r\ninter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation and reunification, \r\nas called for in the draft resolution before us. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nFirst of all, I would like to welcome the presence of the \r\nSecretary-General at this meeting. \r\n In October 2007, the leaders of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea \r\n A/62/PV.41\r\n \r\n3 07-57313 \r\n \r\nheld a second summit meeting and adopted the \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. China \r\nwelcomes this development. \r\n Seven years ago, leaders of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, \r\nwith statesman-like vision, started North-South summit \r\nmeetings, thus providing another important platform \r\nfor the promotion of peace and reunification of the \r\npeninsula. This second summit between the two \r\ncountries has indicated that the two sides have been \r\nworking to seize this historic opportunity and start a \r\nnew era of peace and prosperity for both nations. \r\n The meeting of the leaders of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea \r\nwas in line with the trend towards peace, development \r\nand cooperation in the world in the common interests \r\nof the two countries, and conducive to peace on the \r\npeninsula and peace and stability in our region. \r\n As a friendly neighbour of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, \r\nChina attaches importance to maintaining peace and \r\nstability on the Korean peninsula and works towards \r\nthat end. We have always advocated and supported the \r\nidea that the two sides on the peninsula should resolve \r\ntheir differences through dialogue, to advance the \r\nprocess of reconciliation continually and to achieve \r\nautonomous peace and reunification. China will, as \r\nalways, work hard towards that goal. \r\n Lastly, China supports the inclusion of the item of \r\npeace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula on the agenda of the General Assembly this \r\nyear, and we hope that the draft resolution proposed \r\njointly by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the Republic of Korea can be adopted as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): My \r\ndelegation is very pleased to take part in the debate on \r\nthis important item on the agenda of the United \r\nNations General Assembly. \r\n First and foremost, we wish to thank the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea for their joint efforts in introducing \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.4, entitled “Peace, security and \r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula”. \r\n We are all very delighted to see the two Koreas \r\nworking together in the interests of peace and stability \r\nin the Korean peninsula and in the region. \r\n The second summit meeting, held in Pyongyang \r\nfrom 2 to 4 October 2007 between the two leaders of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and the \r\nRepublic of Korea, and the Declaration on the \r\nAdvancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace \r\nand Prosperity, which was adopted at the summit, are \r\nevents of great historic significance. Viet Nam \r\nwelcomes and highly appreciates the encouraging \r\noutcomes of these developments.  \r\n My country is convinced that this represents an \r\nimportant milestone in the process of improving and \r\ndeveloping relations between the two Koreas. We \r\nfirmly believe that the implementation of the outcomes \r\nof the summit and the Declaration on relations between \r\nthe two Koreas will particularly contribute to \r\npromoting reconciliation, cooperation and the \r\nmaintenance of peace and stability on the Korean \r\npeninsula and in the region. It will also bring the \r\nKoreans closer to their long-held dreams of national \r\nreunification and prosperity.  \r\n Viet Nam will always hope for peace and stability \r\non the Korean peninsula. We consistently support the \r\nsettlement of the issues relating to the Korean \r\npeninsula through dialogue and peaceful negotiations. \r\nWe share the intense aspirations for peace and national \r\nreunification felt by the peoples of the North and of the \r\nSouth on the Korean peninsula.  \r\n Viet Nam has been following the developments \r\non the Korean peninsula with keen interest. We urge \r\nthe international community, and the United Nations in \r\nparticular, to lend their strong support to the two \r\nKoreas in their efforts to give effect to the outcomes \r\nthey have negotiated at the summit meeting, so that \r\nthey can soon reach their common goals of national \r\nreconciliation and reunification.  \r\n As a country that enjoys good relations with both \r\nKoreas, Viet Nam is willing to contribute actively and \r\npositively to the improvement of relations between the \r\ntwo, as well as to the peace process on the Korean \r\npeninsula. We believe enhanced peace and stability on \r\nthe Korean peninsula will further the cause of peace \r\nand security in North-East Asia, as well as in the world \r\nas a whole. \r\nA/62/PV.41  \r\n \r\n07-57313 4 \r\n \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): I would like to express \r\nJapan’s strong support for the draft resolution on \r\n“Peace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula” (A/62/L.4). Japan welcomes the recent \r\ninter-Korean summit as a symbolic event \r\ndemonstrating the deepening of dialogue between the \r\nRepublic of Korea and the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. We believe that the inter-Korean \r\nsummit has contributed to further advancing inter-\r\nKorean relations, as well as to easing tension on the \r\nKorean peninsula.  \r\n Japan welcomes the Declaration on the \r\nAdvancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace \r\nand Prosperity, which was signed at the inter-Korean \r\nsummit. It underscores that the Republic of Korea and \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have \r\nagreed to work together to implement smoothly the \r\nJoint Statement of 19 September 2005 and the \r\n13 February 2007 agreement of the Six-Party Talks. We \r\nalso welcome the commitment made by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea in the outcome document \r\nof the Six-Party Talks issued on 3 October 2007, inter \r\nalia, to declare all nuclear programmes and to disable \r\nthe three facilities at Yongbyon by the end of this year, \r\nas measures to be taken in the second phase for the \r\nimplementation of the Joint Statement of 19 September \r\n2005.  \r\n The denuclearization of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is essential for the peace and \r\nstability of not only North-East Asia, but also of the \r\nentire international community. We consider it most \r\nimportant for the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea to implement these commitments fully. Japan \r\ncontinues to work actively towards a peaceful \r\nresolution of the nuclear issue within the framework of \r\nthe Six-Party Talks, with a view to comprehensively \r\nresolving outstanding issues, such as the abduction, \r\nnuclear and missile issues, settling the “unfortunate \r\npast” and realizing the normalization of relations with \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, based on \r\nthe Japan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nPyongyang Declaration.  \r\n We sincerely hope that the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution will further promote the denuclearization \r\nprocess of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the resolution of other outstanding issues.  \r\n Mr. Khalilzad (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to support the draft resolution \r\non “Peace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula” (A/62/L.4), which recognizes that dialogue \r\nand cooperation between the Republic of Korea and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea are essential \r\nnot only for better relations on the peninsula, but also \r\nto promote peace and stability in the region and \r\nbeyond. The United States has consistently encouraged \r\nsuch a dialogue.  \r\n We welcomed the historic inter-Korean summit \r\nthat was held earlier this month and the Joint \r\nDeclaration, adopted at that meeting, which outlines an \r\nambitious agenda to improve relations and develop \r\ncooperative mechanisms on the Korean peninsula. We \r\nbelieve that this dialogue process is both supportive of \r\nand complementary to progress on the denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula in the Six-Party talks.  \r\n The Joint Statement of 19 September 2005 calls \r\nfor the directly related parties to negotiate a permanent \r\npeace regime on the Korean peninsula at an appropriate \r\nseparate forum, a goal which is also enunciated in the \r\ninter-Korean Joint Declaration. The United States \r\nbelieves these discussions could begin among the \r\ndirectly related parties once the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea has disabled its existing nuclear \r\nfacilities, has provided a complete and correct \r\ndeclaration of all of its nuclear programmes and is \r\nclearly on the road to complete denuclearization. We \r\ncan achieve a permanent peace arrangement on the \r\nKorean peninsula once the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea fully discloses and abandons its \r\nnuclear weapons programme.  \r\n The United States will continue to support efforts \r\nto build better relations between the countries of \r\nNorth-East Asia through the Six-Party Talks and other \r\nappropriate mechanisms. We hope that the \r\nimplementation of both the inter-Korean Joint \r\nDeclaration and the full implementation of the Joint \r\nStatement of 19 September 2005 will lead to better \r\nrelations between the two Koreas, a transformed North-\r\nEast Asia, and better lives for all the people of the \r\nKorean peninsula.  \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): New Zealand \r\nwelcomes the introduction of the joint resolution on \r\n“Peace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula (A/62/L.4) to the United Nations General \r\nAssembly. This is an important record of the second \r\ninter-Korean summit and endorses its central objective \r\nof bringing peace and stability to the Korean peninsula \r\n A/62/PV.41\r\n \r\n5 07-57313 \r\n \r\nand of laying a further foundation for eventual \r\nreunification.  \r\n The security situation on the Korean peninsula \r\naffects the entire region, including New Zealand. \r\nTherefore, New Zealand welcomed the successful \r\ncompletion of the second inter-Korean summit between \r\nthe leaders of the Republic of Korea and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The meeting \r\nbetween President Roh Moo-hyun and Chairman Kim \r\nJong Il was a valuable contribution to international \r\nefforts to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula, and it \r\nprovides an important platform for more detailed \r\ndiscussions on a range of important security and \r\neconomic issues between the two sides. \r\n The summit builds on the recent momentum in \r\nthe Six-Party Talks process and adds to an emerging \r\natmosphere of reconciliation and open dialogue in the \r\nregion, which we hope will lead to the complete \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula. \r\n New Zealand, along with the rest of the region, \r\ntakes great interest in the inter-Korean dialogue, in the \r\nhope that it will serve to reinforce the growing \r\nenvironment of confidence and trust between the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the wider \r\ninternational community. That is the spirit of the draft \r\nresolution to be adopted this afternoon, and we \r\nwelcome it.  \r\n Mr. Alsaidi (Yemen): Let me start by \r\ncongratulating the people of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the people of the Republic of \r\nKorea on the successful summit between their leaders, \r\nheld during the first week of this month. The summit \r\nculminated in an agreement to build a permanent peace \r\nregime, to declare an end to the Korean war and to \r\nwork for peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula. \r\nMost important, the leaders of both Koreas committed \r\nthemselves to the establishment of peace and to the \r\ndenuclearization of the peninsula. \r\n Peace on the Korean peninsula is imperative for \r\npeaceful relations in North-East Asia, a vital region of \r\nthe world. My country’s sympathy with the aspirations \r\nof the Korean people is informed by its own experience \r\nas a divided country for more than 130 years. Yemen \r\nwas reunified in May 1990. Constant conflict and \r\nturbulent relations, exacerbated by regional and global \r\nrivalries, had prevailed between the two parts of \r\nYemen — a situation that was akin to the experiences \r\nof other divided countries, including the Koreas. \r\n The closure of borders was the rule, not the \r\nexception, notwithstanding the torments and sufferings \r\nof divided families. Moreover, the Yemen Arab \r\nRepublic — North Yemen — and the People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic of Yemen — South Yemen — \r\nwere constantly mobilizing their scarce resources for \r\nintra-Yemeni confrontations, which were, unfortunately, \r\nrecurrent. By doing so, each side tried to impose its \r\nwill on the other, by virtue of what it believed to be the \r\nsuperiority of its political system. Consequently, \r\neconomic development suffered; sadly, it was relegated \r\nto the back burner, as opposed to what the elite of each \r\nside thought to be their  raison d’être: unification of the \r\ncountry on their terms.  \r\n Many wars later, with precious resources having \r\nbeen wasted, reunification was finally realized. True, \r\nregional and global circumstances were conducive to \r\nthe attainment of that noble objective. Meanwhile, a \r\nconstitution for the prospective State was worked out \r\nin the interregnum between the many wars and the \r\npeace agreements. Its drafting took 10 years, and it is \r\ntrue that it was not without defects. But it was certainly \r\nan important step in a torturous and meandering \r\njourney towards peace between enemy brothers. It is \r\nalso the case that reunified Yemen is not without \r\ndifficulties; but what we have now is certainly far \r\nsuperior to the state of affairs that existed before \r\n22 May 1990. \r\n With that in mind, my delegation wholeheartedly \r\nsupports draft resolution A/62/L.4. We encourage the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea to fully and unreservedly implement \r\nthe Declaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, because it is a \r\nsine qua non for peace, prosperity and tranquillity in a \r\nvibrant region of world. \r\n Mr. Ney (Germany): Germany fully aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Portugal on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. \r\n Allow me to state that Germany, itself speaking \r\nfrom the perspective of a reunified country, is pleased \r\nwith the course taken by the inter-Korean summit \r\nbetween President Roh Moo-hyun and General \r\nSecretary Kim Jong Il, held in Pyongyang from 2 to \r\n4 October this year. We understand that there is reason \r\nto be optimistic. In the course of the summit meeting, \r\nboth sides — after some time — managed to craft a \r\nA/62/PV.41  \r\n \r\n07-57313 6 \r\n \r\nperspective for a lasting and peaceful solution on the \r\nKorean peninsula. \r\n Germany attentively follows all efforts to \r\ndecrease tensions on the Korean peninsula and looks \r\nupon the developments in that region with special \r\nsympathy. It is now, of course, up to the parties directly \r\ninvolved to create the conditions necessary for \r\nsubstantive negotiations on a peace treaty and to chart \r\nthe course that will be followed. \r\n We are fully aware that this noble cause cannot \r\nbe achieved overnight and that it will depend on further \r\nprogress within the framework of the Six-Party Talks. \r\nWe also acknowledge that the situation on the Korean \r\npeninsula is quite different from that in which \r\nGermany found itself on the eve of unification. But \r\nwhat we have learned from our own experience is that \r\nthe separation of a nation is not irreversible. The two \r\nKoreas will have to find their own way to tackle these \r\nissues, but Germany stands ready, upon request, to \r\nshare its own experience from the years of German-\r\nGerman relations. \r\n Germany is therefore delighted to support draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.4, thereby welcoming the opportunities \r\nand prospects for real peace and prosperity on the \r\nKorean peninsula as laid out in the summit’s \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): As a country with \r\nclose ties to both the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the Republic of Korea, Indonesia has \r\nconstantly supported the process of inter-Korean \r\ndialogue, reconciliation and reunification. As a South-\r\nEast Asian nation, Indonesia consistently recognizes \r\nthe tremendous contribution that peace and stability on \r\nthe Korean peninsula could offer to the wider East \r\nAsian region. \r\n The inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang \r\nearly this month and the adopted declaration constitute \r\na major milestone in inter-Korean relations. We \r\nwelcome these developments. We believe that any \r\nprogress in inter-Korean relations has positive \r\nsignificance for peace and security in the Korean \r\npeninsula and in the wider region. In this regard, we \r\nexpressed our full support for the inclusion of this \r\nadditional item, “Peace, security and reunification on \r\nthe Korean peninsula”, in the agenda of the sixty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly, as we feel it \r\nincumbent upon the United Nations to welcome and \r\nencourage these developments. \r\n We support the joint initiative of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea \r\nto table draft resolution A/62/L.4 before the General \r\nAssembly. We believe that the Assembly should \r\nencourage the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the Republic of Korea to implement the declaration \r\nfully and in good faith and invite Member States to \r\ncontinue to support and assist, as appropriate, the \r\nprocess of inter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation and \r\nreunification. \r\n It is our sincere hope that the draft resolution will \r\nenjoy unanimous support from Member States and will \r\nbe adopted by the Assembly without a vote. \r\n Mr. Pankrasin (Thailand): First of all, let me \r\njoin other delegates in praising the fruitful outcome of \r\nthe summit meeting held in Pyongyang early this \r\nmonth. \r\n That high-level meeting contributed to \r\nconsolidating peace on the Korean peninsula as the \r\nleaders of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the Republic of Korea explored ways to increase \r\nmutual trust through political and military confidence-\r\nbuilding measures, as well as ways to lay the \r\ngroundwork for an eventual inter-Korean economic \r\ncommunity. The success of this recent meeting not only \r\nreflects the strong desire of both sides to jointly \r\npromote cooperation and national reconciliation, but \r\nalso marks progress towards peaceful reunification. \r\n The Declaration on the Advancement of North-\r\nSouth Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, agreed \r\nby the two leaders on 4 October, represents a solemn \r\ncommitment in improving inter-Korean relations. \r\nThailand wishes both sides success in implementing \r\nthe Declaration. \r\n For a long period of time, the Korean peninsula \r\nhas been a hot spot in North-East Asia and the globe as \r\na whole. Since 1950, the tense situation of \r\nconfrontation between the North and the South had \r\nbeen a cause of concern for peace and security in the \r\nKorean peninsula and in the North-East Asian region. \r\nThe recent developments in relations between North \r\nand South have created a favourable environment and \r\nconditions for peace and stability on the Korean \r\npeninsula; this deserves universal praise from the \r\nglobal community at large. \r\n A/62/PV.41\r\n \r\n7 07-57313 \r\n \r\n Thailand stands ready to cooperate with the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea as they work to implement fully the \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. \r\n In this connection, Thailand is pleased to support \r\nthe draft resolution introduced by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea \r\n(A/62/L.4) on “Peace, security and reunification on the \r\nKorean peninsula”. \r\n Mr. Yaroshevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe delegation of Belarus would like to welcome the \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Peace, security and \r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula” (A/62/L.4), \r\nwhich was prepared jointly by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. \r\n The agreements that were reached between the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea at the Pyongyang summit a few \r\nweeks ago were not only a basis for the preparation of \r\nthis draft resolution; they also mark an important \r\nmilestone in improving inter-Korean relations and \r\nconsolidating peace on the Korean peninsula, as well \r\nas in the North-East Asian region. \r\n We note the adoption in Pyongyang of the \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, which is an \r\nimportant stage in reconciling the two countries and in \r\nensuring the peaceful reunification of the Korean \r\npeople. \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and \r\nthe Republic of Korea have shown us all a very \r\neloquent example of the fact that even the most \r\ncomplex and sensitive issues in relations between \r\nStates can be resolved at the negotiating table. \r\nGoodwill, diplomacy, cooperation and a readiness to \r\nhear the other side, as opposed to confrontation, \r\nsanctions and threats — these are the guarantees of \r\nenhanced peace and security. \r\n Belarus is very pleased at this opportunity to \r\nsupport the peace-loving efforts of both countries, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea, and we call on all delegations to \r\nsupport draft resolution A/62/L.4. \r\n Mr. Dolgov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation supports the \r\nadoption by the General Assembly of the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Peace, security and reunification \r\non the Korean peninsula” (A/62/L.4). Our country has \r\nconsistently called for dialogue and normalization of \r\nrelations between the north and south of Korea. \r\n As a close neighbour enjoying friendly relations \r\nwith both Koreas, Russia welcomes the second inter-\r\nKorean summit in Pyongyang, which culminated in the \r\nsigning of a joint Declaration on the Advancement of \r\nNorth-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity \r\nby the leaders of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the Republic of Korea. We certainly wish \r\nthe greatest success for this agreement. We are ready to \r\ncontinue supporting any initiatives, including within \r\nthe context of the draft resolution before us today, \r\nwhich aim at consolidating peace and stability on the \r\nKorean peninsula and in North-East Asia as a whole. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): Canada welcomes the \r\nintroduction of draft resolution A/62/L.4, entitled \r\n“Peace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\nPeninsula”. We commend both the Republic of Korea \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for \r\ntheir renewed efforts towards peace, security and \r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula. \r\n Canada is encouraged by the summit meeting \r\nheld in Pyongyang earlier this month, a welcome step \r\nthat can only enhance understanding between the two \r\nparties. We expect that this will contribute towards \r\ngreater inter-Korean economic cooperation and the \r\nreduction of military tension, as well as to the \r\nrealization of the Korean people’s desire for peaceful \r\nreunification of the peninsula and greater stability in \r\nthe region. \r\n Canada encourages both sides to continue these \r\nefforts in good faith in order to implement fully the \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. It is only \r\nthrough continued mutual effort that the common goals \r\nof peace and prosperity can be reached and that the \r\nfoundation for peaceful reunification can be properly \r\nlaid. \r\n Canada also hopes that this summit will reinforce \r\nthe positive developments in the Six-Party Talks and \r\nhelp to advance efforts toward the denuclearization of \r\nthe Korean peninsula. A peaceful, prosperous Korean \r\npeninsula is in the interests not only of the region, but \r\nalso of the entire international community. Canada \r\nstands ready to help in the achievement of these \r\nimportant goals. \r\nA/62/PV.41  \r\n \r\n07-57313 8 \r\n \r\n Mr. Briz Gutiérrez (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Guatemala firmly supports the draft \r\nresolution on peace, security and reunification on the \r\nKorean peninsula (A/62/L.4) submitted jointly by the \r\ntwo countries and we are pleased to reiterate our \r\nsupport, as we did for resolution 55/11 of 31 October \r\n2000.  \r\n We were pleased to see the outcome of the \r\nsummit held by the leaders of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the Republic of Korea held in \r\nPyongyang from 2 to 4 October 2007 and the joint \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, which \r\nrepresents a major milestone in improving \r\ncommunication and understanding between the two \r\nKoreas. We hope that the cooperation that led to the \r\nsummit and its follow-up will ultimately lead to \r\nreconciliation on the peninsula and better security in \r\nthe region, in accordance with the purposes and \r\nprinciples set forth in the United Nations Charter. \r\n It is in that spirit that Guatemala has made its \r\ncontribution to enhancing peace and stability on the \r\nKorean peninsula. On the one hand, we greatly value \r\nour long-standing bilateral relationship with the \r\nRepublic of Korea, with which we have succeeded in \r\ndeveloping trade, cultural and investment links, as well \r\nas official cooperation links. On the other hand, \r\nGuatemala and the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea established diplomatic relations in September \r\n2007 and our two countries will soon appoint  \r\nnon-resident ambassadors. \r\n The Korean peninsula has been an area of great \r\ntension and a source of great concern for the entire \r\ninternational community. We welcome with satisfaction \r\nall efforts to foster confidence and deal with whatever \r\nquestions remain to be solved. Guatemala hopes that \r\nthe rapprochement between the two Koreas will \r\ncontinue to bear fruit, and we would like to encourage \r\nthe continuation of the policy that both Governments \r\nhave been carrying out. \r\n Along those same lines, draft resolution A/62/L.4 \r\ncontains a clear message from the international \r\ncommunity of the nations represented in the United \r\nNations for both States to continue to work on the \r\nprocess, applying the joint Declaration in good faith \r\nalong with the other agreements arrived at by both \r\nparties, as well as all other measures that will lead to \r\npeacebuilding on the Korean peninsula and which will \r\nset solid foundations for a peaceful reunification.  \r\n We would also like to encourage Member States \r\nto support inter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation and \r\nreunification by providing whatever assistance may be \r\nrequired. We trust that the General Assembly will adopt \r\nthe draft resolution by consensus. \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile is a \r\ncountry in the Pacific Basin, and thus we view with \r\ngreat hope the efforts made by two sister peoples for \r\npeace, reconciliation and reunification. They are \r\ncountries of the Asian Pacific, sharing one language, \r\none past and one destiny — the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. The \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity that resulted \r\nfrom the Pyongyang summit is the outcome of a \r\ndifficult and sensitive process by two States that are \r\ncommitted to reversing a history of struggle and grief. \r\nThose efforts have been a challenge to the political will \r\nof both countries and represent a promise for the future \r\nof the people of the Korean peninsula. \r\n In the draft resolution submitted to the Assembly \r\nby the two Koreas (A/62/L.4) the international \r\ncommunity bolsters those efforts and provides a global \r\npolitical context in which to continue the diplomatic \r\ninitiatives already begun, including the Six-Party Talks \r\nand full implementation of the Beijing agreement  \r\nof 13 February 2007, which will lead to the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the  \r\nre-establishment of a climate of trust in the region. \r\n In 1996 our country was invited to become a \r\nmember of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development \r\nOrganization, one of many initiatives aimed at \r\npromoting peace and development on the Korean \r\npeninsula. We did so because of our commitment to \r\npeace and international security, by which we \r\nunderstand that no State, no matter what its economic \r\nstanding or geographical location are, should fail to \r\njoin in that noble effort to benefit the entire region and \r\nthe world. Since then, our relations with the Korean \r\npeople have improved and deepened. In fact, the first \r\nfree trade treaty negotiated by the Republic of Korea \r\nexists between Chile and the Republic of Korea. We \r\nview the Korean peninsula and Korean culture as \r\nexamples of tenacity, dignity and creative genius.  \r\n In voting in favour of the draft resolution, we are \r\nalso extending our best wishes to the people of the two \r\n A/62/PV.41\r\n \r\n9 07-57313 \r\n \r\nStates, which, we hope, will sooner or later become the \r\none nation that is certainly yearned for by the entire \r\npopulation of that great nation. \r\n The President: Before giving the floor to the \r\nnext speaker, I should like to propose that the list of \r\nspeakers in the debate on this item be now closed. I \r\nhear no objection. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n Mr. Towpik (Poland): Poland fully supports the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Portugal on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. Nevertheless, I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to make some additional \r\ncomments. For many years, Poland has been engaged \r\nin the stabilization efforts in the region, as well as in \r\nthe process of reconciliation between the two Korean \r\nStates. Since 1953 — that means for more than \r\n50 years — we have been continuously participating in \r\nthe Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the \r\nKorean peninsula. \r\n Support for peace and security in the region has \r\nalways been at the heart of Polish foreign policy, and \r\nthat is why Poland sincerely welcomes and supports \r\nthe draft resolution entitled “Peace, security and \r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula” (A/62/L.4). The \r\nfact that the resolution has been prepared and tabled \r\njointly by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the Republic of Korea has a particular, \r\nunprecedented and in fact historical significance. \r\n The draft resolution and recent developments, \r\nsuch as the agreement reached in the framework of the \r\nSix-Party Talks, the inter-Korean summit and the \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, raise prospects \r\nfor real progress on the Korean peninsula. We strongly \r\nencourage the two Korean States to maintain this \r\nunique momentum and to fully implement recent \r\nmultilateral and bilateral Korean agreements. \r\n We hope that, after more than half a century of \r\ndivision, conflicts and tension, the two sides can \r\nestablish mutual trust and strong inter-Korean relations \r\nto ensure peace and stability in the region, where the \r\nKorean people will be able to enjoy better lives. \r\n Ms. Ochir (Mongolia): Mongolia wishes to \r\nextend its strong support to the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Peace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula”, contained in document A/62/L.4. Mongolia \r\nis heartened by the outcome of the second inter-Korean \r\nsummit, held in early October, which resulted in the \r\nadoption of the Declaration on the Advancement of \r\nNorth-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. \r\nFull and faithful implementation of the Declaration \r\nwill be crucial in improving inter-Korean relations, \r\nconsolidating peace on the Korean peninsula and \r\nlaying a solid foundation for peaceful reunification. \r\n As a North-East Asian nation with internationally \r\nrecognized nuclear-weapon-free status, Mongolia is \r\npleased with the recent progress achieved in the  \r\nSix-Party Talks on the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula. In that regard, we welcome the agreement \r\nfor the implementation of the second-phase steps and \r\nlook forward to a speedy realization.  \r\n As its contribution towards advancing the  \r\nSix-Party Talks, Mongolia hosted a bilateral working \r\ngroup session on the normalization of relations \r\nbetween Japan and the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea in September this year and stands ready to \r\ncontinue such efforts in the future. \r\n In light of the promising political dynamics in the \r\nsubregion, Mongolia is optimistic that its early call for \r\na multilateral security cooperation mechanism in \r\nNorth-East Asia will gain further support in the \r\nsubregion and beyond. \r\n Mr. Wai (Myanmar): The delegation of Myanmar \r\nextends its full support to draft resolution A/62/L.4 \r\nentitled “Peace, security and reunification on the \r\nKorean peninsula”. The draft resolution tabled jointly \r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea is unique and commendable. My \r\ndelegation congratulates the two sides on the success \r\nof their joint effort. \r\n The summit meeting between the leaders of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea held in Pyongyang a few weeks ago \r\nand the Declaration on the Advancement of North-\r\nSouth Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity are truly \r\nmilestones in inter-Korean relations. Every effort \r\ntowards peace is a welcome step. My delegation \r\nattaches great importance to the issue of the peaceful \r\nreunification of the Korean peninsula. Recent \r\ndevelopments will further contribute to the cause of \r\npeace and security in North-East Asia and beyond.  \r\n Myanmar enjoys cordial, friendly relations with \r\nboth the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and \r\nthe Republic of Korea and therefore fully supports the \r\nA/62/PV.41  \r\n \r\n07-57313 10 \r\n \r\nendeavours of the leaders of the two countries for \r\npeaceful reunification.  \r\n Myanmar views the recent developments on the \r\nKorean peninsula as a major step towards peace and \r\nprosperity for the people of Korea. The recent steps are \r\nin conformity with Myanmar’s world view, which \r\nsupports every effort to ensure world peace. Myanmar \r\nlooks forward to seeing further developments in that \r\nrespect and will continue to lend its support to all of \r\nthe parties concerned. \r\n My delegation is fully confident that the draft \r\nresolution will be adopted by the General Assembly by \r\nconsensus. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation would like once again voice its appreciation \r\nto you, Sir, for the clear-sightedness with which you \r\nhave been leading the work of the sixty-second session. \r\n I wish to refer to the question of the peaceful \r\nreunification of Korea. My country, the Republic of \r\nBenin, has friendly relations with the two sister \r\nrepublics on the Korean peninsula. For a number of \r\ndecades, Benin has been working to promote the \r\npeaceful reunification of the peninsula, because we are \r\nconvinced that such reunification would lead to \r\nconsiderable improvement in the situation in the entire \r\nregion in the political, economic and social spheres. \r\nThus, the Government of Benin welcomes a \r\nreunification that would put an end to one of the most \r\npainful relics of the divisions caused by the Second \r\nWorld War. \r\n For that reason my delegation is pleased to note \r\nthe specific measures — constructive measures — \r\ntaken by the two Korean leaders during these past \r\nmonths. We welcome, in particular, the success of the \r\nmost recent inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang at the \r\nbeginning of October, and we are pleased at the \r\nopening of new prospects for dialogue between the \r\nRepublic of Korea and the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, as is to be understood from the \r\nDeclaration on the Advancement of North-South \r\nKorean Relations, Peace and Prosperity adopted by \r\nboth leaders on 4 October 2007. \r\n The Government of Benin strongly urges both \r\ncountries to show each other increasing goodwill in \r\nstepping up and broadening the movement to overcome \r\nthe obstacles between the two countries. The joyful \r\naccomplishment of that task will permit the Korean \r\npeople to enjoy the benefits of peace, security and \r\nstability on all levels. \r\n My delegation believes that the adoption of the \r\ndraft resolution before the General Assembly \r\n(A/62/L.4) will make it possible to bring the \r\nendorsement of the United Nations to a process that \r\nhas already been started by both countries and will give \r\nnew impetus to the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to help the Korean people as a whole to \r\novercome the tragic division. It is an approach that \r\nshould be facilitated by the fact that it is supported by \r\nthe consensus presently obtained between the two \r\ncountries on the question. In other words, my \r\ndelegation fully supports the draft resolution and calls \r\non the General Assembly to adopt it as such. \r\n Mr. Tarragô (Brazil): I would like to add my \r\nvoice to those of previous speakers in welcoming the \r\ndraft resolution introduced by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the Republic of Korea entitled \r\n“Peace, security and reunification on the Korean \r\npeninsula” (A/62/L.4). It is a most welcome initiative \r\nas it follows the landmark event of the second  \r\ninter-Korean summit, held in early October in \r\nPyongyang, during which the two Korean leaders \r\nreaffirmed the commitment of their respective \r\nGovernments and peoples to dialogue, cooperation, \r\nprosperity and eventual reunification. The Declaration \r\non the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, \r\nPeace and Prosperity is a major step forward to \r\nbringing inter-Korean relations to a higher stage of \r\ncooperation and understanding. The inter-Korean \r\ndialogue and the joint Korean initiatives on the issue in \r\nthe General Assembly are evidence that this ongoing \r\nprocess of normalization on the peninsula is to be led \r\nfirst and foremost by the Korean people themselves \r\nwith our support.  \r\n In this spirit, following the first inter-Korean \r\nsummit in the year 2000, Brazil co-signed the request \r\nfor the inclusion of an additional agenda item of the \r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly and was a \r\nsponsor of resolution 55/11. We believe the General \r\nAssembly’s adoption, by acclamation, of the draft \r\nresolution now before us (A/62/L.4) will once again \r\ndemonstrate the international community’s keen \r\ninterest in a peaceful, secure, developed and reunified \r\nKorean peninsula. \r\n Brazil considers that a unanimously adopted \r\nresolution of the General Assembly will give renewed \r\n A/62/PV.41\r\n \r\n11 07-57313 \r\n \r\nimpetus to the continuation and strengthening of the \r\ninter-Korean dialogue and to the promotion of \r\nsustainable peace and security on the Korean \r\npeninsula, as well as in North-East Asia and beyond. \r\n Mr. Mantovani (Italy): I should like to add a few \r\nremarks to the statement made by the European Union \r\npresidency, to which Italy fully aligns itself.  \r\n Italy has hailed the recent inter-Korean summit as \r\na key step towards peace, stability, cooperation and \r\neventual reunification on the peninsula. Its positive \r\noutcome is all the more gratifying for our country, as \r\nItaly, has constantly promoted the inter-Korean \r\ndialogue, even at the most difficult stages.  \r\n Since the establishment of diplomatic relations \r\nwith the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in \r\n2000, Italy has hosted, in cooperation with scientific \r\norganizations, a number of seminars on stability and \r\npeace on the peninsula, to which both countries have \r\nactively participated. Moreover, Italy has been one of \r\nthe major contributors to the Korean Peninsula Energy \r\nDevelopment Organization over the years.  \r\n Combined with the encouraging progress towards \r\ndenuclearization, within the framework of the Six-\r\nParty Talks, the inter-Korean dialogue is creating the \r\nconditions for increased cooperation and stability on \r\nthe peninsula and in the wider region. This is a \r\nstrategic process that all Member States and relevant \r\ninternational organizations should support, as called for \r\nin the draft resolution before us (A/62/L.4). Italy is \r\nready to play its part, including by increasing its \r\nassistance to the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea in the humanitarian, health, education and \r\ncultural sectors as announced by Deputy Foreign \r\nMinister Vernetti in his recent visit to the peninsula just \r\nbefore the summit.  \r\n Finally, we are particularly pleased that the \r\nGeneral Assembly has been able to address, in a timely \r\nand consensual manner, such a topical issue. We \r\nbelieve that through initiatives like this one, the \r\nGeneral Assembly reaffirms its relevance and its ability \r\nto meaningfully react to key international \r\ndevelopments. That is the most effective way to pursue \r\nthe objective of a revitalized and reinvigorated General \r\nAssembly, which has constantly been a priority for our \r\ndelegation. \r\n Mr. Islam (Bangladesh): Bangladesh welcomes \r\nthe introduction of the draft resolution entitled “Peace, \r\nsecurity and reunification on the Korean peninsula” \r\n(A/62/L.4). We also welcome the historic second \r\ninter-Korean summit, held from 2 to 4 October in \r\nPyongyang. \r\n Bangladesh strongly believes that constructive \r\ndialogue is the best way to reduce tension on the \r\nKorean peninsula. In that context, the second  \r\ninter-Korean summit is an important milestone in the \r\nprocess of improvement and development of relations \r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the Republic of Korea. We envisage that this \r\nadvancement would finally result in a unified Korean \r\nin the near future. That is not only the long-held dream, \r\nbut also the desire of the world community. \r\n The United Nations should render all possible \r\nsupport to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the Republic of Korea in their joint effort to \r\nmaterialize the outcomes of the second inter-Korean \r\nsummit meeting. As a country that considers itself a \r\nfriend of both Koreas, Bangladesh is willing to \r\ncontribute actively and positively to the peace process \r\non the Korean peninsula. We hope that this draft \r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus. \r\n Mr. Elghitany (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation underlines its welcome of draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.4 entitled “Peace, security and reunification on \r\nthe Korean peninsula”, sponsored by the delegations of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea. Also, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress Egypt’s support of the content and thrust of the \r\ndraft resolution which stresses the importance of \r\npromoting dialogue between the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, in the \r\ninterest of strengthening security on the Korean \r\npeninsula. That contributes to the stability of the \r\nNorth-East Asia region and actively embodies the \r\nefforts to implement United Nations principles and \r\npurposes for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. \r\n There is no doubt that dialogue and serious \r\nnegotiations among all parties concerned are the best \r\nmeans to positively address all issues in dispute. In this \r\ncontext, the delegation of Egypt welcomes the \r\ndeclaration issued on 4 October following the summit \r\nof the two Koreas on enhancing relations between \r\nthem. Also, we support the goals and incentives of the \r\ndeclaration, which forms a solid foundation for \r\nachieving constructive steps towards rapprochement \r\nA/62/PV.41  \r\n \r\n07-57313 12 \r\n \r\nand reconciliation between the two countries so that \r\neventually they will be peacefully reunified. That \r\nwould enhance regional stability and peace as well as \r\nglobal security, which is a common goal for all of us. \r\n Mr. Malmierca Díaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba welcomes the draft resolution submitted jointly \r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea, entitled “Peace, security and \r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula” (A/62/L.4). We \r\nbelieve that it clearly shows the positive results that \r\ncan be obtained through dialogue and cooperation. \r\nInter-Korean dialogue and cooperation are paramount \r\nfor consolidating peace and security on the Korean \r\npeninsula and, also, to contributing to peace and \r\nstability in the region, as well as at the international \r\nlevel. Cuba has supported and continues to support the \r\npeaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.  \r\n For this reason, my country welcomed the  \r\ninter-Korean summit held from 2 to 4 October 2007 \r\nand the Declaration on the Advancement of North-\r\nSouth Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, adopted \r\non 4 October as an outcome of the summit. We are \r\npleased at the determination stated by both parties fully \r\nto implement the Declaration, as part of the process \r\ntowards peaceful reunification.  \r\n During the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) \r\nSummit Conference held last year in Havana, heads of \r\nState or Government stressed the importance of \r\nguaranteeing durable peace and security on the Korean \r\npeninsula for the sake of the common prosperity of the \r\nKorean people, as well as for the peace and security of \r\nNorth-East Asia and the rest of the world. Likewise, \r\nthe NAM Summit expressed its support towards efforts \r\nto reunify the Korean peninsula based on the legitimate \r\naspirations and concerted efforts of the Korean peoples \r\nthemselves as stated in the joint declaration issued on \r\n15 June 2000 at the historic North-South summit held \r\nin Pyongyang.  \r\n As in the past, Cuba will continue to fully support \r\nthe process of inter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation \r\nand reunification. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item.  \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.4. May I take it that the Assembly \r\ndecides to adopt draft resolution A/62/L.4?  \r\n Draft resolution A/62/L.4 was adopted (resolution \r\n62/5).  \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n The Secretary-General: Allow me to welcome the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s adoption by consensus of \r\nresolution 62/5, entitled “Peace, security and \r\nreunification on the Korean peninsula”. I offer my \r\nsincere congratulations to the representatives of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea.  \r\n Today’s date coincides exactly with the date \r\nseven years ago when the General Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 55/11 following the June 2000 summit of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nRepublic of Korea. I welcome that coincidence. In my \r\nhomeland of Korea, it is an ancient custom to choose \r\nan auspicious day for any celebration or new \r\nendeavour. Inevitably, I also look back on the \r\npreparations for the 2000 summit and on its follow-up, \r\nin which I was personally involved as Vice-Foreign \r\nMinister of the Republic of Korea.  \r\n Today, as the Secretary-General, I feel a much \r\nmore personal obligation to do all I can to encourage \r\nand facilitate the continuing work for peace, security \r\nand reunification on the Korean peninsula. I am \r\nconvinced that the historic inter-Korean summit will \r\npave the way for a permanent peace regime and \r\neventual reunification. It will lead to increased  \r\ninter-Korean reconciliation, cooperation and shared \r\nprosperity. I also believe it will act as a catalyst for \r\ncontinued progress in the Six-Party Talks on the \r\ndenuclearization of the peninsula.  \r\n Once again, I commend the wisdom and courage \r\nof Chairman Kim Jong Il and President Roh Moo-hyun \r\nin seizing the momentum and taking this significant \r\nstep forward. I also thank the General Assembly for its \r\nunanimous support for this resolution, which attests to \r\nthe aspiration of the international community for peace \r\nand stability in the region.  \r\n It will now be of the utmost importance to \r\nimplement fully the outcome of the summit. Every step \r\nin carrying out the agreed elements of the declaration \r\nwill be an important measure for confidence-building \r\non the peninsula. I encourage the leaders of both \r\nKoreas to maintain the momentum created by this \r\n A/62/PV.41\r\n \r\n13 07-57313 \r\n \r\nhistoric turn of history. And I encourage all Member \r\nStates — in particular those engaged in the Six-Party \r\nTalks — to lend their valuable support in sustaining a \r\nfavourable atmosphere and assisting in the \r\nimplementation of the outcome. As Secretary-General, \r\nI stand ready to provide every assistance required, in \r\nclose cooperation with the international community. \r\n The President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto conclude its consideration of agenda item 167? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n The President: Before proceeding to the next \r\nitem on the agenda, I wish to announce that this will be \r\nthe last meeting of the General Assembly for Ms. Gail \r\nGrossman, Senior Conference Officer in the \r\nDepartment for General Assembly and Conference \r\nManagement. Ms. Grossman has been with the United \r\nNations for 34 years, for the majority of which she has \r\nbeen associated with the work of the plenary of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Her contribution to the smooth \r\nrunning of the meetings of the Assembly has been truly \r\nsignificant, and I would like the Assembly to give her a \r\n \r\nround of applause in appreciation. We wish \r\nMs. Grossman all the best.  \r\nAgenda item 66 \r\n \r\nPromotion and protection of the rights of children \r\n \r\n (b) Follow-up to the outcome of the special session \r\non children \r\n \r\n  Draft decision (A/62/L.8) \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take \r\naction on draft decision A/62/L.8, entitled \r\n“Participation of children and non-governmental \r\norganizations in the round tables of the \r\nCommemorative High-level Plenary Meeting Devoted \r\nto the Follow-up to the Outcome of the Special Session \r\non Children”. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to adopt draft decision A/62/L.8? \r\n Draft decision A/62/L.8 was adopted. \r\n The President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item \r\n(b) of agenda item 66.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 4.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
