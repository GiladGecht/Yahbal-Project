(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 12 (continued) \r\n \r\nSupport by the United Nations system of the efforts \r\nof Governments to promote and consolidate new or \r\nrestored democracies  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.9) \r\n \r\n The President: Members will recall that the \r\nGeneral Assembly held the debate on this Agenda item \r\nat its 44th plenary meeting, on 5 November 2007. \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.9. Before giving the floor to the speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote before the vote, may I remind the \r\ndelegates that explanations of vote are limited to ten \r\nminutes and should be made by delegates from their \r\nseats. \r\n Mr. Chernenko (The Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): The Russian Federation supports Qatar’s \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Support by the United \r\nNations system of the efforts of Governments to \r\npromote and consolidate new or restored democracies.” \r\nWe support and actively participate in the \r\nintergovernmental process under United Nations \r\nauspices, characterized by its openness and based on \r\nthe principle of constructive engagement.  \r\n In our opinion, the process of new or restored \r\ndemocracies seeks to resolve two interrelated tasks. \r\nFirst of all, it performs an important function in \r\nproviding a forum to exchange positive experiences in \r\ndemocratic construction and strengthening the \r\nfoundation and principles of democracy. Secondly, and \r\nno less important, is its provision of support to States \r\nas they request it. We are convinced that this type of \r\nexchange of experience and constructive involvement \r\nwill allow us to enrich the very concept of democracy \r\nand give new substance to its principles.  \r\n As was correctly noted in this draft resolution, \r\nthere is not a single model or single recipe for \r\ndemocracy in our world. All attempts to impose \r\nunilateral approaches, any attempts to forcibly \r\ninculcate or implant, in different parts of the world, \r\none’s own approaches to democracy are fraught with \r\nthe most negative consequences on the stability of \r\ndifferent countries and regions. \r\n The President: We have heard the only speaker \r\nin explanation of vote before the vote. The General \r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.9. I should like to announce that since the \r\nintroduction of the draft resolution, the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors: Albania, the \r\nBahamas, Bulgaria, Cape Verde, the Comoros, the \r\nCzech Republic, Germany, Japan, Kuwait, the Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali, \r\nMonaco, Montenegro, Philippines, Poland, Saudi \r\nArabia, Sweden, Thailand, Ukraine and the United \r\nArab Emirates. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.9? \r\n  Draft resolution A/62/L.9 was adopted (resolution \r\n62/7).  \r\n \r\nA/62/PV.46  \r\n \r\n07-58830 2 \r\n \r\n The President: Before giving the floor to the \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanation of votes are limited to ten \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): The \r\ndelegation of Benin welcomes the adoption of draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.9, entitled “Support by the United \r\nNations system of the efforts of Governments to \r\npromote and consolidate new or restored democracies” \r\nfor several reasons. As the host country of the Fourth \r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies, held in Cotonou from 4 to 6 December \r\n2000, Benin remains strongly committed to \r\nstrengthening democracy in Africa and to the process \r\nof the International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies. \r\n On top of organizing various missions to \r\nexchange experiences, which makes it possible to \r\nweave a dense network of international cooperation \r\nand consultation with democratic national institutions, \r\nBenin was one of the main forces at the African level \r\nin the drafting of the African Charter on Democracy, \r\nElections and Governance, which was adopted by the \r\nAfrican Union in January 2007, at Addis Ababa. This \r\ntext is a priceless victory for the peoples of the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n Benin is closely following the development of the \r\nNew or Restored Democracies Movement. We express \r\nour great appreciation to Qatar for its initiatives within \r\nthe framework of the follow-up to the implementation \r\nof the final declaration of the Sixth International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, held in \r\nDoha in November 2006. We must also welcome the \r\nactivities of the Advisory Board that was established to \r\nassist the Chairman in Office of the Movement in his \r\nefforts to ensure a systematic implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the Doha declaration.  \r\n It is also fortunate that within this framework the \r\nAdvisory Board was able to adopt its plan of action for \r\nthe 2007-2009 period. It is important that member \r\nStates be able to cooperate closely in its \r\nimplementation through practical actions having an \r\nimpact on the ability of democratic institutions to play \r\ntheir role in the operation of democratic systems put in \r\nplace.  \r\n Benin thanks all the countries that have taken \r\ndifferent initiatives to support the efforts of new or \r\nrestored democracies in their efforts to strengthen their \r\nnational institutions and to promote good governance \r\nso that democracy can go hand in hand with economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development.  \r\n The Secretary-General has presented a very \r\ninformative report on Government initiatives and \r\nmakes it possible to assess the dynamic of solidarity \r\nshowed by the international community for new or \r\nrestored democracies, but also the bold actions that \r\nthose democracies have been carrying out in order to \r\nstrengthen their democratic achievements. We must be \r\ngrateful for these developments. It would be desirable \r\nfor the next report to deal with the efforts of the United \r\nNations system.  \r\n My delegation reiterates its steadfast support for \r\nthe process of the International Conference of New or \r\nRestored Democracies as a framework for discussion \r\nand action in order to strengthen the advances made by \r\nnew or restored democracies. That is why we fully \r\nsupport the resolution that has just been adopted on \r\nsupport for new or restored democracies. \r\n The President: We have heard all the speakers in \r\nexplanation of vote. May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 12? \r\n  It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 112 (continued) \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council \r\n \r\n  Letter from Germany (A/62/159) \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will first proceed \r\nto a by-election to elect a member of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council in accordance with rule 140 of the rules \r\nof procedure.  \r\n In this connection, I would first like to draw the \r\nattention of members to document A/62/159, \r\ncontaining a letter dated 23 July 2007 from the Chargé \r\nd’affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of \r\nGermany to the United Nations. In his letter, the \r\nChargé d’affaires announces that Germany would like \r\nto relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil at the end of the year 2007 for the remaining \r\n A/62/PV.46\r\n \r\n3 07-58830 \r\n \r\nterm in favour of Liechtenstein. As a result, a vacancy \r\nwill occur and the new member must therefore be \r\nelected to fill Germany’s unexpired term of office, \r\ncommencing 1 January 2008 and expiring on 31 \r\nDecember 2008.  \r\n In accordance with paragraph 4 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December \r\n1971 and taking into account that the vacancy will \r\noccur from among the Western European and other \r\nStates, the new member should therefore be elected \r\nfrom that region.  \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that the \r\ncandidate who receives a two-thirds majority and the \r\ngreatest number of votes by Members present and \r\nvoting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie \r\nvote, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to \r\nthose candidates who have obtained an equal number \r\nof votes.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, the \r\nelection shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be \r\nno nominations. Also in accordance with rule 92, we \r\nshall proceed to the election by secret ballot.  \r\n I should like to inform members that, as of 1 \r\nJanuary 2008, the following States from the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States will be represented \r\non the Economic and Social Council: Austria, Canada, \r\nFrance, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, \r\nPortugal and the United States of America. The names \r\nof these eight States should therefore not appear on the \r\nballot.  \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure, no representative shall interrupt the \r\nvoting except on a point of order on the actual conduct \r\nof the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.  \r\n Ballot papers will now be distributed. I request \r\nrepresentatives to use only those ballot papers and to \r\nwrite on them the name of the State for which they \r\nwish to vote. A ballot will be declared invalid if it \r\ncontains the name of more than one Member State \r\nfrom the relevant region for the one vacant seat \r\nassigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if \r\nthe name of the Member State on that ballot does not \r\nbelong to the relevant region. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ehrmann \r\n(Austria), Ms. Molemele (Botswana), Ms. \r\nBeshimova (Kyrgyzstan), Mrs. Zanelli (Peru) and \r\nMr. Mićić (Serbia) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n  The meeting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11 a.m. \r\n \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group B – Western European and Other States \r\n(1 seat) \r\nNumber of ballot papers:  180 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:    14 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:  166 \r\nAbstentions:      14 \r\nNumber of Members voting: 152 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 102 \r\nNumber of votes obtained:  \r\n Liechtenstein   129 \r\n Sweden        8 \r\n Iceland        6 \r\n United Kingdom      5 \r\n Germany        3 \r\n Switzerland       1 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nLiechtenstein has thus been elected a member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for a term of office \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 \r\nDecember 2008.  \r\n I congratulate Liechtenstein on having been \r\nelected a member of the Economic and Social Council. \r\n The General Assembly will next turn to the \r\nelection of 18 members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to replace those members whose term of office \r\nexpires on 31 December 2007. \r\n The 18 outgoing members are: Albania, Brazil, \r\nChad, China, Costa Rica, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, Denmark, Guinea, Iceland, India, \r\nLithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Russian \r\nFederation, South Africa, Thailand and the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \r\nA/62/PV.46  \r\n \r\n07-58830 4 \r\n \r\nPursuant to rule 146 of the rules of procedure, these \r\ncountries are eligible for immediate re-election. \r\n Members will recall that Germany relinquished \r\nits seat on the Economic and Social Council, effective \r\n1 January 2008 and Liechtenstein has just been elected \r\nto fill that vacancy. \r\n Consequently, as of 1 January 2008, the \r\nfollowing States will be represented on the Economic \r\nand Social Council: Algeria, Angola, Austria, \r\nBarbados, Belarus, Benin, Bolivia, Canada, Cape \r\nVerde, Cuba, the Czech Republic, El Salvador, France, \r\nGreece, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Indonesia, Iraq, \r\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, \r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, the Netherlands, \r\nParaguay, the Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Saudi \r\nArabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and the United \r\nStates of America. The names of these 36 States should \r\ntherefore not appear on the ballots. \r\n In accordance with paragraph 4 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December \r\n1971, and taking into account the number of States that \r\nwill remain members of the Council after 1 January \r\n2008, the 18 members should be elected as follows: \r\nfour from African States, four from Asian States, three \r\nfrom Eastern European States, three from Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and four from Western \r\nEuropean and other States. The ballot papers reflect \r\nthis pattern. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of \r\nseats to be filled, who receive a two-thirds majority of \r\nvotes and the greatest number of votes and by \r\nMembers present and voting, will be declared elected. \r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will \r\nbe a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates \r\nthat have obtained an equal number of votes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, the \r\nelection shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be \r\nno nominations. \r\n Regarding candidatures of the respective regional \r\ngroups, the Secretariat has been informed that for the \r\nfour vacant seats from among the African States, the \r\nGroup has endorsed four candidates: Cameroon, the \r\nCongo, Mozambique and the Niger. For the four vacant \r\nseats from among the Asian States, the Group has \r\nendorsed four candidates: China, Malaysia, Pakistan \r\nand the Republic of Korea. For the three vacant seats \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States, the Group \r\nhas endorsed three candidates: Moldova, Poland and \r\nthe Russian Federation. For the three vacant seats from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States, the \r\nGroup has endorsed three candidates: Brazil, Saint \r\nLucia and Uruguay. For the four vacant seats from \r\namong the Western European and other States, the \r\nGroup has endorsed four candidates: Iceland, New \r\nZealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure, no representative shall interrupt the \r\nvoting except on a point of order on the actual conduct \r\nof the voting. \r\n I should like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the \r\nelection. Please be reminded that during the voting \r\nprocess, all campaigning should cease in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. This means in particular that once the \r\nmeeting has begun, no more campaign material can be \r\ndistributed inside the Hall. All delegates are also \r\nrequested to remain at their seats so that the voting \r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank \r\nmembers for their cooperation. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers and to write on them the names of \r\nthe States for which they wish to vote. \r\n A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains \r\nmore names of Member States from the relevant region \r\nthan the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will \r\nalso be declared invalid if all the names of the Member \r\nStates on the ballot do not belong to the relevant \r\nregion. If a ballot paper for a region contains some of \r\nthe names of the Member States that do not belong to \r\nthe region, the ballot remains valid but only the names \r\nof the Member States that belong to the relevant region \r\n A/62/PV.46\r\n \r\n5 07-58830 \r\n \r\nwill be counted. The names of Member States that do \r\nnot belong to that region will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ehrmann \r\n(Austria), Ms. Molemele (Botswana), Ms. \r\nBeshimova (Kyrgyzstan), Mrs. Zanelli (Peru) and \r\nMr. Mićić (Serbia) acted as tellers.  \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n  The meeting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n Mr. Jallow (Gambia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Group A – African States (4 seats) \r\n Number of ballot papers:    188 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:         0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    188 \r\n Abstentions:           1 \r\n Numbers of Members voting:   187 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   125 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Cameroon      183 \r\n  Congo      183 \r\n  Mozambique     184 \r\n  Niger      183 \r\n  Nigeria          2 \r\n  Democratic Republic of the Congo      1 \r\n  Somalia          1 \r\n  Sudan          1 \r\n Group B – Asian States (4 seats) \r\n Number of ballot papers:    188 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:         0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    188 \r\n Abstentions:           0 \r\n Numbers of Members voting:   188 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   126 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  China      181 \r\n  Malaysia       185 \r\n  Pakistan      177 \r\n  Republic of Korea    179 \r\n  Qatar          1 \r\n  Saudi Arabia         1 \r\n  Lao People’s Democratic Republic     1 \r\n Group C – Eastern European States (3 seats) \r\n Number of ballot papers:    188 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:         0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    188 \r\n Abstentions:           3 \r\n Numbers of Members voting:   185 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   124 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Moldova      184 \r\n  Russian Federation    180 \r\n  Poland      176 \r\n  Albania          1 \r\n  Belarus          1 \r\n Group D – Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(3 seats) \r\nNumber of ballot papers:    188 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:         0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:    188 \r\nAbstentions:           2 \r\nNumbers of Members voting:   186 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   124 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Brazil      182 \r\n Saint Lucia     181 \r\n Uruguay      181 \r\n Costa Rica          1 \r\n Mexico          1 \r\n Group E – Western European and other States \r\n(4 seats) \r\n Number of ballot papers:    188 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:         0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    188 \r\n Abstentions:           5 \r\n Numbers of Members voting:   183 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   122 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Iceland      178 \r\n  New Zealand     174 \r\n  Sweden      174 \r\n  United Kingdom of Great Britain and  \r\n   Northern Ireland   174 \r\n  Denmark          2 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority \r\nof Members present and voting, the following 18 States \r\nhave thus been elected members of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council for a three-year term beginning on \r\n1 January 2008: Brazil, Cameroon, China, the Congo, \r\nIceland, Malaysia, Moldova, Mozambique, New \r\nA/62/PV.46  \r\n \r\n07-58830 6 \r\n \r\nZealand, Niger, Pakistan, Poland, the Republic of \r\nKorea, the Russian Federation, Saint Lucia, Sweden, \r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland, and Uruguay. \r\n I congratulate the States which have been elected \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council, and I \r\nthank the tellers for their assistance in this election. \r\n This concludes our consideration of sub-item (b) \r\nof agenda item 112. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
