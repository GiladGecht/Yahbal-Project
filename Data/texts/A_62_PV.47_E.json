(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n The President: I wish to inform members of the \r\nreason for the delay in convening today’s plenary \r\nmeeting. I have been advised by United Nations \r\nSecurity and Safety Service that during its routine \r\nsweep of the General Assembly Hall, the canine \r\nhandlers noticed an ash-like substance in the Hall. The \r\nUnited Nations hazmat team collected the substance \r\nand cleansed the area. The team has since declared the \r\nsubstance to be not dangerous. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 111 \r\n \r\nNotification by the Secretary-General under \r\nArticle 12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the  \r\nUnited Nations \r\n \r\n Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/300) \r\n The President: As members are aware, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 12, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nwith the consent of the Security Council, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is mandated to notify the General Assembly of \r\nmatters relative to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security that are being dealt with by the \r\nSecurity Council and of matters with which the \r\nCouncil has ceased to deal. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly takes note of the \r\ndocument before it on this item? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 111? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 9 and 122 \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/62/2) \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters \r\n \r\n The President: Today the Assembly will consider \r\nthe item entitled “Report of the Security Council”. I \r\nhope that our consideration of the item will contribute \r\nto strengthening relations between the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council so that together \r\nboth bodies can better promote the values and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations. \r\n We will also consider the agenda item entitled \r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”. In the 14 years since this matter has been \r\nunder discussion in the Open-ended Working Group, \r\nwe have realized the complexity, sensitivity and \r\ngrowing relevance of Security Council reform. \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, world leaders \r\nrecognized the importance of making progress on \r\nSecurity Council reform an essential element of the \r\noverall efforts to reform the United Nations. They \r\ncommitted to support early reform of the Council in \r\norder to make it more representative, efficient and \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 2 \r\n \r\ntransparent and to further enhance its effectiveness and \r\nthe legitimacy of its decisions. \r\n To further those goals, world leaders also \r\nsupported efforts to adapt the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council, by increasing the involvement of \r\nStates which are not members of the Council. \r\n In her speech to the General Assembly on  \r\n11 December 2006 (see A/61/PV.72), President  \r\nAl-Khalifa urged the membership to take a fresh and \r\nopen-minded approach to the issue of Security Council \r\nreform. Progress has been achieved and I would \r\nencourage the membership to continue in that spirit. As \r\na result of the comprehensive consultation processes \r\nthat have been conducted during the sixty-first session, \r\nwe now have a clear understanding of the positions and \r\nviews of all Member States, as well as the valuable \r\nreports of the facilitators. \r\n Taking into account the progress achieved so far, \r\nthe membership agreed to consider the issue during the \r\nsixty-second session so that further concrete results \r\nmay be achieved, including through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Through these efforts Member States \r\nhave reached a new stage that offers the prospect of \r\nachieving the goal of comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n I wish to assure you of my determination to work \r\nwith all of you in an open and transparent manner to \r\nestablish the most appropriate process, based on the \r\nviews of the entire membership. Since the beginning of \r\nthe sixty-second session I have held informal \r\nconsultations with all interested parties. Member States \r\nhave articulated their preparedness, taking into account \r\nthe progress achieved, to use the current momentum to \r\nmove forward. Based on those consultations, our \r\nobjective should be to develop a framework in order to \r\nbegin intergovernmental negotiations by identifying \r\nand reaching agreement on the various negotiable \r\nelements. In that respect, we should be guided by the \r\nreport of the Working Group (A/61/47), which the \r\nAssembly adopted on 17 September 2007, and the \r\npositions and proposals of Member States. \r\n Member States should have primary ownership \r\nand responsibility over such a process. I therefore look \r\nforward to hearing your substantive proposals and \r\nviews on how to embark on the next stage in this \r\nimportant process so that we can achieve concrete \r\nresults during the sixty-second session. \r\n We must bear in mind that Security Council \r\nreform is an integral part of strengthening the United \r\nNations. I would therefore encourage all Member \r\nStates to remain actively engaged and committed to \r\naddressing this issue. As President of the General \r\nAssembly I only have one request: that we work \r\ntogether in good faith with a view to achieving tangible \r\nresults with the broadest possible agreement during this \r\nsession. And as the ancients would say, “Hic Rhodus, \r\nhic salta”: in essence, actions speak louder than words. \r\n I now give the floor to the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, His Excellency Mr. Marty \r\nNatalegawa, to introduce the report of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): On behalf of all \r\nmembers of the Security Council, I would like to \r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the \r\nsixty-second session of the General Assembly. We are \r\nhopeful that under your able stewardship, we will be \r\nable to enlarge the cooperation between the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. \r\n In my capacity as President of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of November, it is my honour to \r\nintroduce the annual report of the Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, document A/62/2. This report \r\ncovers the period 1 August 2006 to 31 July 2007. \r\n The annual report demonstrates a diverse agenda \r\nfor the Council. The programme is vast and \r\nencompasses all major regions of the globe as well as a \r\nwide array of cross-cutting thematic issues, including \r\nthe strengthening of international law, cooperation with \r\nregional organizations in peace and security and the \r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict, to mention \r\njust a few of the issues involved. The Council has on \r\nits programme of work all major aspects of the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, \r\nincluding armed conflicts, threats to peace and security \r\nposed by terrorist acts, as well as issues dealing with \r\npeacekeeping operations by the United Nations and \r\nrelated actors, and post-conflict peacebuilding. It is an \r\nambitious but important agenda, one which we hope \r\nwill be strengthened by collaboration with our partners, \r\nincluding the General Assembly. \r\n During the reporting period, the Council held 224 \r\nformal meetings, 184 of which were public, as well as \r\n22 meetings with troop-contributing countries. There \r\nwere 192 consultations of the whole, and the Council \r\nadopted 71 resolutions and 52 presidential statements. \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n3 07-59318 \r\n \r\n Developments in Africa were extensively \r\ndiscussed throughout the year. The issue of Darfur was \r\nhighlighted. There were close consultations on that \r\nissue between the Council, the United Nations \r\nSecretariat, the African Union (AU) and the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan. Six resolutions were passed, \r\nincluding resolution 1769 (2007), which authorized the \r\nestablishment of a United Nations-African Union \r\nHybrid Operation in Darfur. The Council received two \r\nbriefings by International Criminal Court Prosecutor \r\nMoreno-Ocampo on the situation in Darfur. \r\n On 6 February 2007, the Secretary-General \r\nbriefed the Council about his meetings at the AU \r\nsummit in Addis Ababa with leaders of several African \r\ncountries. The Secretary-General said it was essential \r\nto support peacekeeping in Darfur and the agreements \r\nreached in Addis Ababa and Abuja. An agreement was \r\nreached between the United Nations and the AU to \r\nrevive the peace process by conducting a joint mission \r\nin the Sudan with special envoys Jan Eliasson and \r\nSalim Ahmed Salim. On 30 April, the Council adopted \r\nresolution 1755 (2007), which extended the mandate of \r\nthe United Nations Mission in the Sudan until \r\n31 October 2007. \r\n On Côte d’Ivoire, the Council convened a number \r\nof meetings and agreed on several measures, including \r\nthe adoption of resolutions 1708 (2006) and 1761 \r\n(2007), which extended the mandate of the group of \r\nexperts monitoring the implementation of sanctions \r\nrelated to Côte d’Ivoire; resolution 1721 (2006), aimed \r\nat implementing fully the peace process in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and organizing free, fair, open and transparent \r\nelections in that country; and resolution 1765 (2007), \r\nwhich renewed the mandate of the United Nations \r\nOperation in Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n The Council welcomed positive developments in \r\npeacebuilding in Sierra Leone, while stressing the need \r\nto address the root causes of the conflict, and \r\nguaranteed the conduct of free, fair and democratic \r\nelections in the country. The Council also welcomed \r\nthe progress achieved by the Special Court for Sierra \r\nLeone and reiterated its support for that body. \r\nFurthermore, through resolution 1734 (2006), the \r\nCouncil extended the mandate of the United Nations \r\nIntegrated Office in Sierra Leone. \r\n The sanctions regime concerning Liberia was also \r\nevaluated and the mandate of the United Nations \r\nMission in Liberia was extended twice, by resolutions \r\n1712 (2006) and 1753 (2007). Through resolution 1760 \r\n(2007), adopted on 20 June, the Council requested the \r\nSecretary-General to establish, within one month, a \r\nthree-member panel of experts to conduct a follow-up \r\nassessment mission to Liberia and neighbouring States \r\nto investigate the implementation of the measures \r\noutlined in resolution 1521 (2003). \r\n A possible coup attempt in Burundi at the \r\nbeginning of the reporting period prompted a \r\npresidential press statement on the matter. In October \r\n2006, a United Nations integrated office was \r\nestablished there, following the expiry of the United \r\nNations operation. In June 2007, the Council welcomed \r\ntalks between the President of Burundi and the leader \r\nof the Forces nationales de libération — Palipehutu-\r\nFNL — and the agreement reached by the parties. \r\n The mandate of the United Nations Mission in \r\nEritrea/Ethiopia (UNMEE) was extended, with some \r\ntroop withdrawals. On 17 October 2006 the Council \r\ncalled on Eritrea to withdraw its troops from the \r\nTemporary Security Zone and lift restrictions imposed \r\non UNMEE. The Council also called on the parties to \r\nshow maximum restraint and on Ethiopia to implement \r\nfully the Boundary Commission’s decision. By \r\nresolution 1767 (2007), adopted on 30 July, the \r\nCouncil extended the mandate of UNMEE until \r\n31 January 2008. \r\n During this period, Somalia remained in turmoil. \r\nAmong the issues on the table were the status of the \r\npeace talks, the military build-up and its regional \r\nimplications and the humanitarian situation. Last \r\nFebruary, the Council authorized the African Union to \r\nestablish a mission in Somalia and urged the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to send a team to determine the feasibility of a \r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operation. The Council \r\nstressed the need for a broad and inclusive political \r\nprocess and appealed to the international community to \r\nassist the AU with financial and logistical support. \r\n Instability in Chad and its borders with the \r\nCentral African Republic and the Sudan prompted the \r\nmandate for a possible multidimensional force in Chad. \r\nThe humanitarian situation in the country was also a \r\nconcern. A visit by the Under-Secretary-General for \r\nHumanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator reported that there was a deteriorating \r\nsituation in the humanitarian dimension and that there \r\nwas a pressing need for political solutions. In July \r\n2007, the idea of sending a European force to protect \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 4 \r\n \r\nrefugees in eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central \r\nAfrican Republic was also considered by the Council. \r\n After going through precarious times with respect \r\nto political, security and economic conditions in late \r\n2006, most Council members expressed support for the \r\nongoing mandate of the United Nations Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office in Guinea-Bissau. There were also \r\nconcerns about ongoing political and social tensions \r\nbetween the National Assembly and the Government, \r\nand the Council urged the parties to resolve their \r\ndifferences through dialogue and strict respect for the \r\nconstitutional framework. Last July, Council members \r\nwelcomed the formation of a new Government and a \r\nstability pact that it hoped would set the foundation for \r\ngenuine reconciliation. \r\n On 9 August 2006, the Council held an open \r\ndebate on peace consolidation in West Africa, urging \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States and \r\nthe West African States to curb illicit cross-border \r\nactivities. It reiterated the importance of solidarity \r\namong African leaders for peace and security in the \r\nregion as well as for addressing cross-border issues. \r\n The Council adopted several presidential \r\nstatements on the Democratic Republic of Congo: in \r\nAugust 2006, regarding the elections; in September, \r\nregarding the clash in Kinshasa; in November, looking \r\nforward to the installation of a democratically elected \r\nGovernment; in April 2007, regarding the violence in \r\nKinshasa; and in July, expressing concern at the \r\ndeteriorating security situation in the east of the \r\ncountry. Through resolution 1756 (2007), the Council \r\nextended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo until 31 December \r\n2007. \r\n In line with its extensive considerations of issues \r\nin Africa, the Council conducted a mission to Africa \r\nfrom 14 to 21 June 2007. The mission visited several \r\nAfrican capitals, including Addis Ababa, Abidjan, \r\nAccra, Khartoum and Kinshasa, and met with officials \r\nfrom the African Union and the countries visited. \r\nCouncil members emphasized the importance of an \r\nexchange of views with the African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council, and it was decided that the two \r\nbodies should meet yearly. The Council also explored \r\nhow the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, could \r\nassist the AU, particularly when the AU was acting \r\nunder a Security Council mandate. \r\n The situation in the Middle East and the \r\nPalestinian question continued to be considered on a \r\nmonthly basis. There were seven open debates on the \r\nsituation, two of which were at the ministerial level. In \r\nNovember 2006, a draft resolution was introduced by \r\nQatar but not adopted, owing to the negative vote of a \r\npermanent member. In December, there was a \r\ncomprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nsituation in the Middle East and the peace process over \r\nthe past 10 years. \r\n The question of Lebanon was also discussed. On \r\n11 August 2006, the Council unanimously adopted \r\nresolution 1701 (2006), which, inter alia, renewed and \r\nenhanced the mandate of the United Nations Interim \r\nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The implementation of \r\nresolution 1701 (2006) was followed closely, as were \r\nthe implementation of resolution 1559 (2004) and the \r\nwork of the International Independent Investigation \r\nCommission and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. By \r\nresolution 1748 (2007), the Council extended the \r\nmandate of the Commission, and, by resolution 1757 \r\n(2007), the Council established the Special Tribunal for \r\nLebanon. In a presidential statement issued in June \r\n2007 (S/PRST/2007/21), the Council condemned the \r\nterrorist attack against UNIFIL peacekeepers. \r\n Iraq remained under the Council’s consideration. \r\nIn August 2006, the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nin Iraq (UNAMI), whose goal is to assist Iraq in \r\nconstitutional development, in reforming the legal and \r\njudicial system, in promoting human rights and in \r\nresponding to humanitarian challenges, was extended \r\nby resolution 1700 (2006). The resolution also \r\nunderlines the importance of cooperation between Iraq \r\nand its neighbouring countries, as well as the \r\nsignificance of the International Compact with Iraq. In \r\nNovember 2006, the mandate of the multinational force \r\nin Iraq was also extended, by resolution 1723 (2006), \r\nand the Council reaffirmed the hope that Iraqi forces \r\nwould soon be able to assume full responsibility for the \r\npeace and security of their country. In March 2007, the \r\nCouncil issued a statement by the President to the press \r\nexpressing support for the United Nations and its \r\nSecretary-General in promoting an inclusive and \r\neffective process of national reconciliation. In June \r\n2007, the Council adopted resolution 1762 (2007), \r\nterminating the mandate of the United Nations \r\nMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission. \r\n From 11 to 16 November 2006, the Council sent a \r\nmission to Afghanistan. After debate on the mission \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n5 07-59318 \r\n \r\nreport, which described its achievements and the \r\nchallenges it encountered, the Council unanimously \r\nextended the mandate of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) until March 2008. \r\nThe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in \r\nAfghanistan was also extended, until October 2007. \r\nCouncil members voiced their concern about the \r\nsecurity situation, including civilian casualties, and \r\nabout increased violence and terrorist activities carried \r\nout by the Taliban, Al-Qaida and other extremist \r\ngroups. \r\n With regard to Asia, the Security Council \r\nextended the mandate of the United Nations Integrated \r\nMission in Timor-Leste through resolution 1745 (2007) \r\nand supported the electoral process. The results of \r\npresidential elections in Timor-Leste were announced \r\nin May and August 2007, and the Council called upon \r\nthe Government to confront the challenges facing the \r\ncountry. It is hoped that the election will have a \r\nunifying impact on the people of Timor-Leste and that \r\nit will pave the way for peace. The Personal \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General in Nepal \r\npresented a report on the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement signed on 21 November 2006 by the \r\nGovernment of Nepal and the Communist Party \r\n(Maoist). The report requested United Nations \r\nassistance in implementing the agreement. The Council \r\nexpressed support for a technical assessment team to \r\nbe sent by the Secretary-General. Pursuant to that, a \r\nUnited Nations Mission was established in Nepal, and \r\nthe Council reaffirmed its support for the peace \r\nprocess, calling for timely, fair and transparent \r\nelections. \r\n The Council had several meetings on the situation \r\nin Myanmar during the reporting period. In January \r\n2007, a draft resolution was introduced by the United \r\nStates of America but not adopted, owing to the \r\nnegative vote of two permanent members. \r\n In Europe, the Kosovo issue, particularly the \r\nfuture-status process, was among the high priorities on \r\nthe Council’s agenda. The Council regularly considered \r\nthe activities of the United Nations Interim \r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo; discussed \r\nproposals for Kosovo’s future-status settlement, made \r\nby the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General; and \r\ndispatched its mission. From 25 to 28 April 2007, the \r\nmission visited Brussels, Belgrade, Priština and Vienna \r\nand held a dialogue on the issue with the European \r\nUnion, NATO, Belgrade, representatives from Priština \r\nand the Special Envoy. However, after much effort on a \r\ndraft resolution, the Council was not able to reach an \r\nagreement, and work on the draft was suspended. \r\n The Council held several consultations on \r\nGeorgia during the reporting period. The mandate of \r\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia was \r\nextended, and the Council called for the parties to \r\ncomply with the ceasefire and to refrain from violence, \r\nas well as to finalize agreements on the non-use of \r\nviolence and the return of refugees and displaced \r\npersons. \r\n Among the thematic issues taken up by the \r\nCouncil during the year were threats to peace and \r\nsecurity caused by terrorist acts; non-proliferation, \r\nparticularly in North Korea and Iran; civilians in armed \r\nconflict; women, peace and security; and post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. Attention was also given to the role of \r\nregional organizations, including the African Union, as \r\nwell as to genocide prevention, security sector reform, \r\nclimate change and security, natural resources and \r\nconflict, small arms, and the International Tribunals for \r\nthe former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. \r\n On the issue of international terrorism, in \r\nSeptember 2006 the Council was briefed, at a public \r\nmeeting, by the Chairmen of three subsidiary bodies: \r\nthe Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 \r\n(1999) concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and \r\nassociated individuals and entities; the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee, established pursuant to \r\nresolution 1373 (2001); and the Committee established \r\npursuant to resolution 1540 (2004), on the non-\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction to non-\r\nState actors, particularly terrorists. Similar briefings by \r\nthe Chairmen of those Committees were given in May \r\n2007. In December 2006, the Council adopted a \r\npresidential statement on the review of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Executive Directorate (S/PRST/2006/56). \r\nThe Council also adopted several press and presidential \r\nstatements condemning the terrorist attack in Iran \r\n(SC/8957) and the bombing of the Delhi-Lahore \r\n“Friendship Express” train in India (SC/8961), in \r\nFebruary 2007; two suicide attacks in Algiers \r\n(S/PRST/2007/10) and a bomb attack in Baghdad \r\n(S/PRST/2007/11), in April 2007; and other terrorist \r\nattacks in Yemen (S/PRST/2007/26), in July 2007. \r\n With respect to non-proliferation, the Council \r\nadopted resolution 1737 (2006) on 23 December 2006. \r\nIt imposed sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 6 \r\n \r\nthe demands set out in resolution 1696 (2006). \r\nResolution 1747 (2007) expanded those sanctions in \r\nresponse to continuing non-compliance by Iran. On  \r\n14 October 2006, the Council adopted resolution 1718 \r\n(2006), imposing sanctions on the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. \r\n Attention was also accorded by the Council to \r\nsuch issues as the protection of civilians and children \r\nin armed conflict situations and women, peace and \r\nsecurity. In March 2007, the Council agreed on a \r\npresidential statement (S/PRST/2007/5) conveying the \r\nview that it is essential to promote full and equal \r\nparticipation by women in post-conflict and \r\npeacebuilding efforts. \r\n The Security Council’s cooperation with the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission moved forward. On  \r\n31 January 2007, the Council held an open debate on \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding, focusing on practical steps \r\nthat could be taken to improve peacebuilding across \r\nthe work of the United Nations and on the importance \r\nof partnerships between the principal organs and those \r\ncontributing to peacebuilding. Linkages between the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations were sought. \r\n On 8 January 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-\r\nmoon participated in a formal debate of the Council on \r\nthreats to international peace and security. The meeting \r\nemphasized that the current global challenges and \r\nthreats demanded a resolute and coherent response \r\nbased on the collective security system of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. The Council requested regular \r\nreporting on regions of potential armed conflict as well \r\nas a greater focus on peacekeeping in attaining the set \r\nobjectives of missions, and stressed the importance of \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n The Council also examined the importance of \r\nregional organizations to international peace and \r\nsecurity. On 20 September 2006, there was a \r\nministerial open debate on the topic. A presidential \r\nstatement called on regional and subregional \r\norganizations to engage in closer cooperation and to \r\npromote conflict prevention, peacebuilding and \r\npeacekeeping. In a separate session on 28 March 2007, \r\nthe Council convened an open debate on similar \r\nthemes, focusing on Africa. As reflected by a \r\npresidential statement agreed upon at the meeting \r\n(S/PRST/2007/7), the Council recognized the \r\nimportant role of regional organizations in the \r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts, in \r\naccordance with Chapter VIII of the United Nations \r\nCharter. The Security Council’s relationship with the \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council was taken \r\nforward during the Council’s mission to Addis Ababa \r\nin June 2007, during which a joint statement was \r\nagreed between the two Councils, committing the two \r\nbodies to closer cooperation across the conflict \r\nspectrum. \r\n The Council held an open debate on security \r\nsector reform on 20 February 2007 to discuss possible \r\nUnited Nations approaches aimed at fostering the \r\ncreation of effective, accountable and sustainable \r\nsecurity institutions that operate within the fabric of \r\nthe rule of law and respect for human rights. In its \r\npresidential statement (S/PRST/2007/3), the Council \r\nstressed that reforming the security sector was critical \r\nin post-conflict environments to consolidating peace \r\nand stability, reducing poverty, establishing the rule of \r\nlaw and good governance, extending legitimate State \r\nauthority and preventing countries from relapsing into \r\nconflict. \r\n On 25 June 2007, the Council held an open \r\ndebate on natural resources and conflict. In the \r\npresidential statement that was adopted after the debate \r\n(S/PRST/2007/22), the Council recognized the role that \r\nnatural resources can play in armed conflict and post-\r\nconflict situations by contributing to the outbreak, \r\nescalation or continuation of armed conflict. \r\nFurthermore, the Council stressed the crucial role that \r\nnatural resources can play in contributing to long-term \r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. \r\n On 28 August 2007, the Council held an open \r\ndebate on the role of the Security Council in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security in Africa. In the \r\npresidential statement that was adopted after the debate \r\n(S/PRST/2007/31), the Council noted the need to \r\nprovide coherence and enhanced coordination, both in \r\nterms of policy and operationalization, among all \r\nstakeholders involved in conflict prevention, \r\nhighlighting the determination of the Council to \r\nstrengthen its role in preventing and resolving \r\nconflicts. The Council also welcomed the intention of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict Prevention and \r\nResolution in Africa to hold a seminar expected to \r\ncontribute to the elaboration of an effective global \r\nconflict-prevention strategy. \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n7 07-59318 \r\n \r\n As a final point, the Council recognized the \r\nimportance of effective working methods. The \r\npresidential note (S/2006/507) remained a practical \r\nreference in the work of the Council during the period \r\nof coverage, especially in its efforts to enhance \r\neffectiveness and transparency. The participation of \r\nnon-Council members had been accommodated in \r\nvarious open debates throughout the year. Council \r\nmembers also continued to pay attention to the issue of \r\nSecurity Council mandate review within the relevant \r\nad hoc committee. \r\n On behalf of all Council members, I extend my \r\nthanks to Members of the General Assembly for the \r\nopportunity to present to Members the activities of the \r\nCouncil over the past year. I would also like to express \r\nmy appreciation, on behalf of the Council, for the work \r\nof the Secretary-General and Secretariat staff for their \r\ninvaluable support of the Council’s activities and for \r\ntheir professionalism in the discharge of their \r\nresponsibilities so that the Council can undertake its \r\nimportant work. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Thank you very \r\nmuch, Mr. President, for organizing this debate. I also \r\nthank the current President of the Security Council for \r\nintroducing the Council’s report (A/62/2) this morning. \r\n The annual report of the Security Council, in its \r\nvery first sentence, indicates an increase in the \r\nworkload of the Council, which confirms the trend of \r\nrecent years. The Council is thus playing the central \r\nrole foreseen for it under the Charter. At the same time, \r\nof course, the permanent pressure under which the \r\nCouncil operates may at times be to the detriment of \r\nthe depth and quality of its discussions and the \r\ndecision-making process. Under these circumstances, \r\nthe Council must be particularly cautious in taking on \r\nnew issues, especially issues that do not relate to clear \r\nand direct threats to international peace and security. \r\n The ever-increasing workload also poses \r\nparticular challenges in the area of working methods, \r\nin particular the question of whether adjustments to the \r\nway the Council goes about its business can create \r\nmore space and time for the necessary deliberations. \r\nWhile it is up to the members of the Council to make \r\nthose adjustments, inter alia, by taking up ideas \r\nbrought to their attention from the outside, they are \r\ncertainly in the direct interest of the membership as a \r\nwhole, on whose behalf the Council carries out its \r\nwork. We must not lose sight of the goal, agreed upon \r\nin the World Summit Outcome Document, of making \r\nthe Council more efficient and transparent, further \r\nenhancing its effectiveness and the legitimacy and \r\nimplementation of its decisions. The more \r\noverwhelming the internal deliberations are for \r\nCouncil members, the smaller the likelihood of regular \r\nand substantive interaction with the rest of Member \r\nStates. Efficiency and transparency can thus very easily \r\nbe combined and are, in some respects, even \r\ncomplementary. \r\n Like others, we were very interested in the \r\nmeasures in the area of working methods that the \r\nCouncil adopted in July 2006. They are contained in \r\ndocument S/2006/507, as the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Indonesia just mentioned. The extent \r\nto which — and the regularity with which — these \r\nmeasures are applied are, however, unclear to us. It \r\nwould appear that their application depends for the \r\nmost part on the respective presidency of the month \r\nand that it does not therefore do enough to create a \r\nmore lasting relationship between the Council and the \r\nrest of the Member States. \r\n This debate usually gives rise to complaints about \r\nthe nature of the report of the Council, the most \r\npopular criticism being the lack of analysis in the \r\nannual report. Repeating this same criticism each and \r\nevery time the annual report is discussed holds little \r\nappeal for us. It is of course, to some extent, also \r\nunderstandable why it would be difficult for the \r\nCouncil to produce the report in a manner that is \r\nsignificantly different from what can at this time be \r\ncalled its traditional format. \r\n The discussions about format, however, hide a \r\nlarger point. On the one hand, the work of the Council \r\ntakes up much of our attention in private discussions \r\nand makes for a very large portion of the coverage in \r\nthe media. But at the same time, there is never an open \r\nand perhaps even interactive discussion on the \r\nperformance of the Council among the larger \r\nmembership. Again, the agreement arrived at by the \r\nWorld Summit to enhance the accountability of the \r\nCouncil to Member States and to increase the \r\ntransparency of its work has not been put into practice. \r\nOn balance, it seems to us that the Council has been \r\nbusier than ever over the past 12 months and perhaps \r\nalso more inaccessible than ever. \r\n As a member of the “S-5” group, the working \r\nmethods of the Council are of ever-increasing \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 8 \r\n \r\nimportance to us. We must distinguish between \r\npractical measures such as the format of meetings, \r\nspeaking time, announcement of meetings and so on, \r\nand measures that open up the substantive work of the \r\nCouncil to the rest of the Member States. While \r\nmeasures of the first kind are very important, it is of \r\ncourse the latter ones that make a real difference in \r\nshaping the Council’s relationship with the rest of the \r\nmembership. In particular, when it comes to its \r\nthematic work and to the work of its subsidiary organs, \r\nthe Council can and should significantly benefit from \r\nthe input of States that are not at a given time serving \r\non the Council but play an important role in the \r\nprocess of implementing its decisions. \r\n It is therefore essential that adjustments and \r\nchanges are made to the working methods on an \r\nongoing basis. The Council itself indeed must make \r\nthose changes, but substantive input and inspiration \r\nmust also come from outside, and this is where the \r\nAssembly must play an important role. Such changes \r\nare a reflection of the changing nature of the work of \r\nthe Council. They are thus unrelated to a possible \r\nenlargement of the Council. While they make up an \r\nimportant part of the comprehensive reform of the \r\nCouncil that has been elusive for such a long time, the \r\nimprovements on working methods must proceed \r\nindependently from progress on enlargement and, \r\nhopefully, contribute to creating momentum on \r\nenlargement as well. \r\n The past year has brought quite a few \r\ndevelopments in the area of enlargement. Two reports \r\nwere produced under the leadership of your \r\npredecessor, Mr. President, that tried to show a \r\npossible new path to achieving enlargement of the \r\nCouncil. The intermediary approach, as it is usually \r\ncalled, is to our mind a compromise between the well-\r\nknown positions reflected in texts that were presented \r\nbefore the 2005 World Summit. It should, however, not \r\nbe understood as a less-than-ideal solution that we \r\nwould set about to change or further refine as soon as it \r\nwas adopted. Rather, such an intermediary approach \r\nshould only be considered if it finds the largest \r\npossible political support, which has been elusive for \r\nall the other proposed solutions presented in the past. \r\n Changing the composition of the Council in the \r\nframework of a mandatory review, which we all expect \r\nwill take place under any proposed solution, will not \r\nnecessarily prove to be less difficult than the \r\nenlargement efforts we have been engaged in for some \r\n15 years now. We therefore need a sustainable political \r\nsolution and clear indications thereon from all the \r\nmajor stakeholders. If and when those conditions are \r\nmet, we will be ready, as the membership as a whole, \r\nto engage in the negotiating process that most States \r\nare now calling for. We wish to express our full support \r\nto you, Mr. President, in your difficult task of steering \r\nthese discussions and encourage you to play a creative \r\nand active role in this process. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation wishes to thank you, Mr. President, for \r\nhaving convened this meeting, and to thank the \r\nPresident of the Security Council, the representative of \r\nIndonesia, for his presentation of the report (A/62/2) \r\ntoday. \r\n The delegation of Mexico wishes to indicate that \r\nalthough it recognizes the efforts made to facilitate \r\nconsultations on the content of the Security Council \r\nreport, that document does not, unfortunately, include \r\nsubstantive information on its actions on the various \r\nitems under examination during the period from August \r\n2006 to July 2007. \r\n We believe that the presentation of the report \r\nmust not be a mere step, but the means by which the \r\nCouncil collaborates with the General Assembly, in \r\nwhich all Member State are represented, and that the \r\nCouncil should report in a detailed manner on the \r\nfulfilment of its responsibility in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Mexico insists once \r\nagain that the capacities of the Council and of the \r\nAssembly with regard to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security are concurrent, as \r\nclearly stated by the International Court of Justice in its \r\nadvisory opinion on the legal consequences of the \r\nconstruction of a wall in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, transmitted to the Assembly by document \r\nA/ES-10/273 of 13 July 2004. \r\n While the report includes a section on the \r\nrecommendation for the appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, it does not in any way include details on the \r\nchanges in the election dynamic that took place in \r\n2006. Given that the Security Council held meetings \r\nwith different candidates before adopting a final \r\ndecision, my delegation would have expected some \r\nindication in the report of the Council’s opinion on that \r\nrecent experience and its relevance to such occasions \r\nin the future. \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n9 07-59318 \r\n \r\n It is also interesting to note that in the report’s \r\nindex, there is a section on matters that were brought to \r\nthe attention of the Security Council but not examined \r\nin Council meetings during this period. In that respect, \r\nit would be desirable to know the reasons for which the \r\nCouncil did not consider those items that Member \r\nStates or other entities brought to its attention. That \r\nwould certainly increase transparency in the Council’s \r\nactivities and enhance Member States’ confidence in \r\nbringing issues of specific interest to them to the \r\nattention of the Council. \r\n The report of the Security Council continues to \r\npresent the same deficiencies observed by almost every \r\ndelegation for a number of years now. That is why we \r\ncontinue to ask ourselves if the General Assembly truly \r\nneeds a report consisting of a compilation of Council \r\ndata and documents published during the previous \r\nperiod. \r\n Certainly, that issue leads us to the issue of the \r\nworking methods of the Council, which has also not \r\nbeen solved owing to the polarized positions on the \r\nmatter. A few Member States consider the Security \r\nCouncil not to be accountable to the General \r\nAssembly; hence the nature of the report presented to \r\nus. But for the vast majority of Member States, that \r\nposition is not acceptable. We therefore wish for better \r\nworking methods for the Council in order to achieve, \r\namong other things, an analytical report that will \r\ncontribute to evaluating the actions of the Council. If \r\ndelegations here in the Assembly consider these reports \r\nto be of little use, how much more should the members \r\nof the Council ask themselves what interest such \r\ndocuments serve, beyond the confines of this \r\nOrganization? \r\n It is not a coincidence that every year, on the \r\noccasion of the presentation of the report, we also \r\ndebate the issue of Security Council reform. The \r\npresidency of the General Assembly, at its sixty-first \r\nsession, undertook a remarkable effort to achieve \r\nprogress in that area. Thanks to that initiative, we were \r\npresented with a new approach, the so-called \r\ntransitional or intermediary approach, oriented towards \r\nfinding a compromise solution. The debate over the \r\nextent and limitations of that approach has already \r\ntaken place and was very intense, benefiting from \r\nmuch participation. My delegation’s position was \r\npresented in the statement we made on 19 July 2007. \r\n Several delegations clearly supported the \r\napproach, in a spirit of realistic compromise, which \r\nopened the possibility of ending the stalemate on the \r\nmatter, 14 years after the establishment of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the \r\nSecurity Council. That was precisely what all of the \r\nfacilitators involved in the process called for. However, \r\nthere were also voices, and we should acknowledge \r\nthem, that rejected such an approach. In the final \r\nbalance, the elements of consensus that remain are few \r\nbut substantive: the status quo is unacceptable and \r\nmany members, including Mexico, are willing to \r\nnegotiate. \r\n However, the delegation of Mexico considers \r\nthat, in any case, intergovernmental negotiations aimed \r\nat reaching the widest possible agreement for Security \r\nCouncil reform should occur in a transparent and open \r\nway, within the Open-ended Working Group which \r\nalready exists for that purpose, and should be based on \r\nthe proposals by the facilitators from the presidency of \r\nthe sixty-first session of the General Assembly. \r\n In that context, we believe that the appointment \r\nof new facilitators or the establishment of any other \r\nkind of mechanism would not contribute to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiating process that we intend to \r\nstart as soon as the Working Group’s work resumes. \r\n In that respect, we wish to indicate that Mexico \r\nconsiders it essential that, in a spirit of collaboration \r\namong all Member States, we avoid searching for or \r\nproposing unexpected options with urgent deadlines on \r\nthe margins of the existing process, in order to \r\ncontinue the negotiations on this issue of particular \r\ninterest to the international community. \r\n We must be fully aware that, in order to launch an \r\nintergovernmental negotiation, there should be \r\nagreement on at least three basic principles: first, the \r\ninclusion of all known options; secondly, the exclusion \r\nof any element that aims at prejudging the final result \r\nof the process; and thirdly, the reaffirmation of the \r\nrequisite consensus or the widest possible agreement, \r\nthat is, clearly above two-thirds of Member States. \r\nThose basic principles must be carefully observed, \r\nsince, otherwise, we risk creating a dangerous division \r\nin this Organization. \r\n That is why Mexico has insisted on a gradual and \r\ncautious reform. The enlargement of the Security \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 10 \r\n \r\nCouncil is, in our view, viable in the short term if it is \r\nfounded on the following criteria. \r\n First, the expansion should only include the \r\ncategory of new non-permanent members, whose \r\nprecise number and duration of mandate would be \r\ndetermined within the framework of the negotiations, \r\nin order to achieve a new configuration that is \r\nrepresentative of the contemporary world. \r\n Secondly, the introduction of the re-election \r\nprinciple for all non-permanent members would \r\nguarantee a more frequent and continuous presence of \r\nthose States with a greater readiness to play an active \r\nrole on the most relevant items of the agenda, starting \r\nwith the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Thirdly, accountability with regard to the \r\nperformance of every non-permanent member that \r\naspires to re-election would be guaranteed in a process \r\nwith the characteristics we have outlined. \r\n Fourthly and finally, the regulation of the use of \r\nthe veto and the review of the Council’s working \r\nmethods should be, in our view, a counterpart to the \r\nactions that the five permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council should be willing to undertake in the \r\ncontext of such a reform. \r\n The process of United Nations reform is under \r\nway. However, if we do not have concrete results on \r\nthe Security Council, reform will remain incomplete. \r\nMexico is convinced that the will of States is the key to \r\nthis decisive moment in this new stage of Security \r\nCouncil reform. \r\n My delegation wishes to renew its full \r\ncommitment to participating in the consultations that \r\nthe presidency deems necessary, and to collaborate, in \r\na constructive and active spirit, in the elaboration of a \r\nprocess of negotiation that will be acceptable for all \r\nMember States and will allow us to make progress on \r\nthis fundamental issue on our agenda. \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): First of all, \r\nmy delegation would like to thank His Excellency \r\nAmbassador R.M. Marty M. Natalegawa, President of \r\nthe Security Council for November, for his informative \r\npresentation on the work of the Council over the 12 \r\nmonths of the reporting period. We also highly \r\nappreciate the efforts to move forward the Council’s \r\nreform process by the President of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first session, Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa, and her facilitators in the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Allow me to avail myself of this opportunity to \r\nthank all Member States for the valued support given \r\nto my country during the elections of non-permanent \r\nCouncil members held on 16 October 2007 \r\n(A/62/PV.26). Viet Nam, elected to serve on the \r\nCouncil for the next two years, is fully committed to \r\nmaking proactive and positive contributions to the \r\nwork of the Council in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n My delegation welcomes the continuing \r\ndiscussion of the Council’s work as a way to enhance \r\ndialogue and cooperation between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly as well as other organs of the United \r\nNations system. Aware that the Council held 184 open \r\nmeetings, out of 224 formal meetings, during the \r\nreporting period, we are pleased to underscore the \r\nattempts by Council members to enhance transparency \r\nand accountability in the Council’s work and their \r\nefforts to provide greater opportunities for all Member \r\nStates to better understand the work of the Council and \r\nto engage with the issues of common interest and \r\nconcerns on the Council’s agenda. It is our hope that \r\nmore concerted efforts will be made to that effect. \r\n The statistics provided in the Council’s report \r\nshow a growing trend in its activities, both in scope \r\nand dimension. They also remind us that conflict and \r\ntensions are still prevalent in many regions around the \r\nworld, a fact that requires the international community \r\nto show further determination and provide more \r\nresources to bring those conflicts to satisfactory \r\nresolutions. We are particularly concerned with the \r\ncycle of escalating violence and the elusive peace \r\nprocess in the Middle East and the fragile peace \r\nprocesses in some African countries, while non-\r\ntraditional threats such as terrorism and the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction continue \r\nto pose serious threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n In that context, we welcome the intensive efforts \r\nmade by the Council and the Secretary-General in his \r\ngood offices capacity to promote a peaceful solution to \r\nthe crisis in Darfur and to foster stability and \r\npeacebuilding in Burundi, Somalia, Afghanistan and \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n11 07-59318 \r\n \r\nIraq. In addition, the recent encouraging developments \r\non the Korean peninsula, in particular the inter-Korean \r\nsummit meetings and the positive outcomes of the Six-\r\nParty Talks on the nuclear issue, are significant and \r\nwelcome steps that promise to consolidate stability and \r\npeace on the Korean peninsula and beyond. \r\n Much, however, remains to be done by the \r\nCouncil to advance the major objectives of conflict \r\nprevention, peacemaking and peacebuilding in the \r\nworld. In the face of various emerging challenges, the \r\nCouncil must revitalize itself to discharge its duties in \r\na more adequate and effective manner. It goes without \r\nsaying that the Council needs to be reformed in a \r\nsubstantial and timely manner. \r\n Turning to the question of reforming the Security \r\nCouncil, my delegation wishes to reiterate that such \r\nreform is crucial to the United Nations reform process. \r\nMaking the Council more representative and its work \r\nmore democratic, effective and transparent, especially \r\nwith regard to decision-making, is vital for adapting \r\nthe United Nations to the realities of the current world. \r\nA modern Security Council should be enlarged in both \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories, where \r\ndeveloping countries in particular will have more \r\nrepresentatives to voice their views and concerns in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n On the other hand, the use of the veto should be \r\nlimited and the Council’s working methods \r\nsubstantially improved, in order to make the Council \r\nmore accessible and transparent to all Member States. \r\nPending any decisions to be adopted on the reform of \r\nits membership, the Council should further improve its \r\nown working procedures and expand its interaction \r\nwith other United Nations organs. Public meetings, \r\nbriefings and press conferences should continue to be \r\nexpanded in order to provide a timely and greater \r\nsource of information on the activities of the Council \r\nto all Member States. \r\n In that regard, we commend the efforts of the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of \r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nRelated to the Security Council in carrying out \r\nintensive consultations over the past year which have, \r\nin our view, generated concrete ideas and proposals to \r\nmove the reform process of the Security Council \r\nforward. Accordingly, we welcome its report and \r\nsupport the decision to continue considering the topic \r\nat the present session of the General Assembly so that \r\nfurther concrete results may be achieved, including \r\nthrough intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n We share the view that the reform process of the \r\nSecurity Council now stands at a defining stage where \r\nall Member States should utilize the momentum \r\ninitiated by the recent efforts to move ahead. It is high \r\ntime that we commit ourselves to genuine negotiations. \r\nMy delegation is willing to participate in discussions \r\nand consultations with other Members in an open, \r\ninclusive and constructive manner on the issues at \r\nhand. It is our conviction that under your excellent \r\nleadership and wise guidance, Mr. President, the \r\nreform process will move much further ahead and we \r\nwill arrive at a fruitful outcome that garners the \r\nsupport of the widest majority of the membership of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Mr. Almansoor (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nFirst of all, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on the wise \r\nmanner in which you have been conducting our open \r\ndiscussions. I wish to thank His Excellency the \r\nPermanent Representative of Indonesia, Ambassador \r\nMarty Natalegawa, the President of the Security \r\nCouncil this month, for having introduced the annual \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/62/2), pursuant to \r\nArticle 15 of the United Nations Charter. \r\n Bahrain likewise welcomes the joint debate on \r\nagenda item 9 on the report of the Security Council and \r\non agenda item 122 on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters. Those two \r\nitems are interconnected and are the subject of special \r\nattention on the part of Member States. \r\n The annual report of the Security Council \r\ncomprehensively covers the work of the Council, the \r\nnumber of meetings it holds, and questions it has \r\ndiscussed at its previous session. However, we feel that \r\nthe report would be more useful if it contained a more \r\nanalytical evaluation of the work done by the Council \r\nduring the reporting period. It could also have been a \r\ngeneral reference tool for Member States. In view of \r\nthe importance of the item on the agenda of the \r\nAssembly, Member States should have enough time at \r\ntheir disposal to consider the report in an in-depth \r\nmanner in order to be able to examine it carefully and \r\nthoroughly, and in order to have a real and transparent \r\nidea of the discussions of the Council that are of \r\ngreatest interest to the entire international community. \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 12 \r\n \r\n The Security Council should take full account of \r\nthe provisions of the Charter and of General Assembly \r\nresolutions relating to the mandates of United Nations \r\norgans. Article 24 of the Charter entrusts the Council \r\nwith the responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. However, that Article \r\ndoes not authorize the Council to take up matters that \r\nfall within the competence and prerogatives of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. That impingement on the mandates of other \r\nUnited Nations organs is a clear violation of their \r\npowers and could complicate and even cause confusion \r\nin the implementation of the Charter. This prompts us \r\nto reaffirm the importance of cooperation and \r\ncoordination among the main United Nations bodies, \r\nwhich is a sine qua non for meeting the various serious \r\nchallenges that we all encounter. \r\n We would not be wrong to encourage here the \r\npresidents of the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council to meet \r\nperiodically to discuss their respective agendas. That \r\ncould only reinforce coordination among them so as to \r\navoid any interference by a given body in the functions \r\nand mandates of the other bodies. \r\n Clearly the question of equitable representation \r\non the Security Council and an increase in its \r\nmembership is extremely important to Member States. \r\nThat item was included on the Assembly’s agenda for \r\nthe first time at its thirty-fourth session, in 1979. At the \r\ntime, the discussion led to the Assembly’s adoption of \r\nresolution 48/26 on 3 December 1993, which \r\nestablished the Open-ended Working Group on the \r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase \r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other \r\nRelated Matters to the Security Council. \r\n Since 1994, the Working Group has been working \r\nto reach agreement on various aspects of that question. \r\nHowever, efforts to date have been inconclusive. While \r\nit is true that when the leaders of the world adopted the \r\nOutcome Document of the 2005 World Summit, they \r\nrenewed their faith in the United Nations and once \r\nagain expressed their commitment to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter, they also reaffirmed their \r\ncommitment to support an accelerated reform of the \r\nSecurity Council to make it more representative, \r\nefficient, effective and transparent and to increase the \r\nimplementation of its resolutions. That should \r\nencourage Member States to show more openness in \r\ntheir attitude in order to achieve the progress hoped for \r\nin that area. \r\n We wish to reiterate here that the Security \r\nCouncil reform process must be multidimensional. We \r\nneed to reach agreement on a number of principles. \r\n First, there should be an increase in the number \r\nof permanent and non-permanent members pursuant to \r\nthe principle of equitable geographic representation, so \r\nas to enable developing countries and least developed \r\ncountries to be represented in the Council on an equal \r\nbasis with the developed countries. The current \r\nimbalance needs to be remedied; it does not serve the \r\ninterest of all Member States. Furthermore, a \r\npermanent seat should be given to the Arab States to be \r\noccupied on an alternating basis and in coordination \r\nwith the League of Arab States. \r\n Secondly, constraints should be imposed on the \r\nuse of the veto power; it should only be used on a \r\nrestricted basis pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter. \r\nLimits must be imposed that would invalidate the veto \r\nwhen there is a positive vote by a majority of member \r\nStates of the Security Council and by a two-thirds \r\nmajority vote of the membership of the General \r\nAssembly. Thirdly, sanctions should not be imposed \r\nuntil all peaceful means to resolve conflicts have been \r\nexhausted, as stipulated in Chapters VI and VIII of the \r\nCharter. Recourse to Chapter VII should be a last resort \r\nafter all other peaceful methods of resolution have \r\nbeen exhausted and after in-depth discussions of short- \r\nand long-term ways not to impose sanctions have been \r\ncarried out. In any event, sanctions should not be \r\nimposed as a means to punish civilians or used as an \r\nact of vengeance against them. The purpose of \r\nsanctions must be clearly defined and a specific \r\ntimeline for their application established. \r\n Fourthly, the working methods and procedures of \r\nthe Council must be reformed. The principles of \r\ntransparency and openness should be taken into \r\naccount in the work of the Council to foster a greater \r\nparticipation on the part of non-members of the \r\nCouncil, in particular countries directly concerned by \r\nmatters discussed in the Council, in keeping with \r\nArticle 31 of the Charter. \r\n Furthermore, the number of closed or informal \r\nconsultations should be limited and the number of open \r\nand inclusive debates increased, in order to enhance \r\ntransparency in the Council’s work while not limiting \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n13 07-59318 \r\n \r\nparticipation by United Nations Member States in open \r\ndebates. \r\n The Security Council should organize \r\ncomprehensive informational briefings to keep \r\nMember States abreast of its activities. While it is true \r\nthat the Charter has given the Council the task of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security and has \r\nasked it to act on behalf of Member States, the \r\nCouncil’s agenda should still be an objective and \r\nnon-selective reflection of the needs and interests of all \r\nMember States. Expansion of the Council should \r\nguarantee a greater representation of developing \r\ncountries and of small countries and the decision-\r\nmaking process should be truly democratic. \r\n It is high time for the Council to acquire official \r\nrules of procedure, since its existing rules of procedure \r\nare still provisional and are more than 50 years old. \r\nThat issue has repeatedly hampered the work of the \r\nCouncil and has impelled it to take inappropriate steps \r\nduring these times, which are beset by challenges and \r\ncrises. The lack of a finalized set of procedural rules is \r\na serious shortcoming and should not be disregarded. \r\nAgreeing on such rules should be one of the Council’s \r\ntop priorities. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that a consensual formula \r\ncan be agreed upon in order to narrow differences of \r\nviews. A common denominator needs to be found that \r\nis applicable and acceptable to all, guaranteeing a \r\nmeaningful reform of the Security Council so that all \r\nMember States — small and large — can be \r\nrepresented there and so that everyone can feel that the \r\nSecurity Council is really acting on their behalf. This \r\nwould be in keeping with the Charter and reflect and \r\nsafeguard the interests and rights of all Member States, \r\nprotecting them against disasters, crises and wars and \r\nguaranteeing respect for their independence. \r\n Mr. Baum (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank the Security Council for its annual \r\nreport (A/62/2) and for its introduction to the General \r\nAssembly. Like many other delegations, Switzerland \r\nlast year expressed regret that the report was not \r\nsufficiently analytical, which limited its value-added \r\nfor Member States as a whole. This year we note that \r\nthe report, as usual, contains a comprehensive \r\noverview of the Council’s meetings, activities and \r\ndecisions. \r\n We also note some improvements. The \r\ninformation is placed within a more analytical context. \r\nHowever, we continue to believe that the document \r\ncould better reflect the challenges confronting the \r\nCouncil as well as the assessments and analyses carried \r\nout during the reporting period. The Council’s \r\ndecisions on sanctions or peacekeeping put an ever-\r\nincreasing burden on Member States. That clearly \r\nrequires more accountability. Only if the Council is \r\nbetter able to explain itself will national parliaments \r\ncontinue to pick up the check for the Council’s \r\ndecisions. \r\n We are obviously aware of the difficulties \r\ninvolved in producing a report which goes beyond \r\nmere enumeration of the Council’s activities and \r\nmeetings. Nonetheless, we encourage the Council to \r\nkeep striving for a report that responds to the needs of \r\nMember States. That also applies to the subsidiary \r\nbodies of the Council whose work is hardly reflected in \r\nthe report. \r\n Reform of the United Nations and therefore \r\nreform of the Security Council continues to be of very \r\ngreat importance. The initiatives taken by the former \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the reports of \r\nthe two groups of facilitators that followed express the \r\nneed for progress on Security Council reform. \r\n Switzerland is convinced that Member States \r\nshould build upon the momentum created in the \r\ninformal consultations in the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on Security Council Reform. We consider that \r\nthe two reports submitted by the facilitators are a \r\nvaluable basis for discussion. \r\n The time has come to give the issue of \r\nenlargement of the Security Council new impetus. The \r\ndebate of 19 July in the Open-ended Working Group \r\nconfirmed that none of the models presented so far will \r\nsucceed in gaining the support needed to bring about \r\nSecurity Council reform. An intermediary approach, as \r\noutlined by the facilitators, could reconcile the various \r\npositions on enlargement, provided that Member States \r\nshow the flexibility that many of us are calling for. \r\n Switzerland welcomes the call contained in the \r\nlatest report of the Open-ended Working Group to start \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly. For that to happen, \r\nwe believe that the report of the facilitators should be \r\ntransformed into a document that can serve as a basis \r\nfor negotiation. That could be done by mandating one \r\nor more of the facilitators in New York or by \r\nappointing a special envoy who would conduct \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 14 \r\n \r\nconsultations at the highest level in national capitals, as \r\nsuggested by the Foreign Minister of Belgium at this \r\nyear’s general debate. \r\n Whatever option is chosen by you, Sir, we \r\nencourage you to launch a process that results in the \r\nsubmission of a document for negotiation. \r\n On 18 October 2007, Security Council Report \r\nissued a special paper on the Council’s working \r\nmethods, containing an impressive compilation of \r\nefforts undertaken since 1993 to reform the Council’s \r\nworking methods. It thus attests well to the importance \r\nthat Member States continue to give to the issue. \r\nSwitzerland acknowledges that progress has been \r\nmade, but we remain convinced that more can and \r\nshould be done. We believe that further improvement \r\nof the working methods of the Council would not only \r\nmake it more transparent and increase the involvement \r\nof Member States in the work of the Council, but \r\nwould also serve the interests of the Council itself by \r\nconferring greater legitimacy on its decisions. \r\n The concrete proposals of the “S-5” group — \r\nCosta Rica, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Singapore and \r\nSwitzerland — are well known. Therefore, I will just \r\nrecall one — the development of equitable and clear \r\nprocedures in the current sanctions regimes, in \r\nparticular with regard to listing and delisting. In that \r\ncontext, we consider that the recommendations \r\nsubmitted at the end of 2006 by the Informal Working \r\nGroup of the Security Council on General Issues of \r\nSanctions, provide an excellent basis for strengthening \r\nexisting sanctions regimes. Switzerland would \r\ntherefore welcome the renewed efforts of that working \r\ngroup in order to ensure the follow-up of that important \r\nwork. \r\n We are well aware of the fact that the work of the \r\nCouncil has considerably increased over the past 15 \r\nyears. An improvement of its working methods should \r\ntherefore go hand in hand with efforts made to enhance \r\nits efficiency. We also believe that the Security Council \r\nAffairs Division should be provided with enough \r\nresources to give to the Council and its subsidiary \r\norgans the assistance they expect. \r\n Progress on improving the working methods will \r\nnot eliminate the need to enlarge the Security Council. \r\nMember States must address the need confronting the \r\nCouncil that it better reflect today’s geopolitical \r\nrealities and the need for an enhanced representation of \r\ndeveloping countries. In other words, enlargement and \r\nimprovement of the working methods should ideally go \r\nhand in hand, which means that the difficulties caused \r\nby expansion should not hamper the improvement of \r\nthe working methods that a large number of Member \r\nStates want to see. \r\n Reform of the working methods is a dynamic \r\nongoing process that will become more urgent and \r\nmore crucial if we are not able to progress on the issue \r\nof enlargement. \r\n Reform of the Security Council remains a \r\npressing issue on the United Nations reform agenda. \r\nSwitzerland is convinced that it is not an impossible \r\nmission, but declarations of intent are no longer \r\nsufficient. Member States should let action follow \r\nwords. Greater flexibility on all sides is required if we \r\nwant to overcome the current impasse. Working \r\ntowards intergovernmental negotiations could pave the \r\nway forward. Switzerland remains committed to reform \r\nof the Security Council and will constructively \r\ncontribute to such a process. \r\n Mr. Al-Jabri (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nSince this is the first time I have taken the floor to \r\nspeak on behalf of Saudi Arabia, I am pleased to \r\nconvey to you, Sir, sincere congratulations on your \r\nassumption of the presidency of the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are sure that you \r\nwill conduct our work successfully. \r\n I also wish to express our thanks and appreciation \r\nto your predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa, the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-first session, which she conducted so ably. We \r\nthank her, in particular for her efforts to discuss the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on the Security \r\nCouncil, which is a subject of crucial importance, in \r\norder to enable the international community to adapt \r\nthe Council to changes of the twenty-first century and \r\nto enhance its role in the area of the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, especially within the \r\ncontext of the new circumstances, dangers and \r\nchallenges that are occurring worldwide. We would \r\nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis tireless efforts working with the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports the \r\nprinciple of the expansion of the Security Council in \r\nthe categories of both permanent and non-permanent \r\nseats, to provide for a democratic and equitable \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n15 07-59318 \r\n \r\ngeographical representation in the Council. We believe \r\nthat Member States have a professional and moral \r\nresponsibility to show the sincere political will to \r\nimplement the 2005 World Summit Outcome, adopted \r\nby Heads of State and Government, without \r\ndiscrimination and disregarding narrow national \r\ninterests. \r\n Specific progress towards reform of the United \r\nNations to adapt it to the threats and challenges of our \r\ncontemporary world has been made. However, reform \r\nof the Security Council through its expansion in both \r\nmembership categories has only seen little progress, \r\nexcept for the nomination of two facilitators, the \r\nholding of meetings and informal consultations, the \r\nadoption of reports without any specific results. All of \r\nthis reflects a sincere desire to reform that important \r\nprincipal organ which is the beating heart of the \r\nOrganization as well as the organ responsible for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms the need \r\nto intensify its efforts as a whole to reform the \r\nstructure of the Security Council in order to make it \r\nmore representative, more effective and more \r\ntransparent and to enhance its effectiveness and \r\nincrease the legitimacy of its decisions for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The \r\npoint is to turn it into a body that is capable of dealing \r\nwith crises before they happen, not just after the event \r\nhas occurred, so that mankind can be spared the crises \r\nit is facing. \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also expresses the \r\nhope that the veto will be used to help the weak and to \r\nhelp them assert their rights, not to substitute for \r\njustice and encourage the path of tyranny and \r\ndespotism.  \r\n The unjustified manner in which the veto is \r\ncurrently being used is a challenge for all of us and \r\ncalls for our attention. The misuse of the veto has \r\nresulted in the continuation of the chronic problem of \r\nthe Middle East, which has lasted for more than 60 \r\nyears. Resolutions of the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly have been adopted but not \r\nimplemented because of this unjustified use of the \r\nveto, which has prevented the establishment of a just \r\nand lasting peace in the Middle East. \r\n Finally, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has \r\nparticipated in all consultations at various levels both \r\nwithin and outside the United Nations. We have stated \r\nour positions and have listened to the statements of \r\nother Member States, which have contained many \r\npositive and constructive ideas. But those statements \r\nwill remain merely theoretical unless they are put into \r\npractice. This leads us to the conviction that the \r\nmembers of the Security Council — particularly the \r\npermanent membership — must play an important role \r\nin addressing this issue in a rational manner, because \r\nthe Council cannot ignore the changes that have \r\noccurred in the world since the establishment of the \r\nOrganization. Those changes require that all of us \r\nagree to make radical changes in the Security Council \r\nin accordance with a geopolitical formula. \r\n Mr. Malmierca Díaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe thank Ambassador Marty M. Natalegawa, \r\nPermanent Representative of Indonesia, for the \r\npresentation of the report of the Security Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly (A/62/2), which covers the period \r\nfrom 16 August 2006 to 31 July 2007. I take this \r\nopportunity to highlight the excellent work that \r\nIndonesia is doing as a Council member. \r\n The report of the Security Council was issued as \r\nan official document just a few days ago. The fact that \r\nthe report was presented so late prevents the General \r\nAssembly from being able to consider it in depth. We \r\nhope that such a situation does not recur in the future. \r\nThis is a very important item on the Assembly’s \r\nagenda, and all of us, as Member States, need a \r\nreasonable period of time to prepare to participate in \r\nthis debate. \r\n This year, the format and approach of the report \r\nare very similar to those of previous years. Clearly, \r\nmuch more needs to be done regarding the report’s \r\ncontents.  \r\n In carrying out its duties, the Council acts on \r\nbehalf of all Member States. In that connection, Cuba \r\nstresses the Council’s responsibility to be accountable \r\nto the General Assembly, in accordance with the \r\nCharter. \r\n Cuba calls once again on the Security Council to \r\nsubmit a more comprehensive and analytical annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly. The report should \r\nassess the work of the Council, including the cases in \r\nwhich the Council has failed to act as well as the views \r\nexpressed by its members during the consideration of \r\nthe items on its agenda. \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 16 \r\n \r\n We also reiterate our appeal to the Security \r\nCouncil, in keeping with paragraph 1 of Article 15 and \r\nparagraph 3 of Article 24 of the Charter, to submit \r\nspecial reports to the Assembly for its consideration. \r\nFurthermore, the Presidents of the Security Council \r\nmust ensure that their monthly assessments are \r\ncomprehensive and analytical and that they are issued \r\nin a timely manner. \r\n Mindful of the need to maintain the balance \r\namong the functions and powers of the principal \r\nUnited Nations organs, Cuba opposes the tendency to \r\nseek to equate reform of the Organization with the \r\ngranting of greater power to the Security Council. \r\nOnce again, we emphasize the need to fully respect the \r\nfunctions and powers of the principal organs, in \r\nparticular of the General Assembly, and to maintain the \r\nbalance among them pursuant to the Charter, as well as \r\nthe need for Member States to put an end to any \r\nattempt to transfer items on the Assembly’s agenda to \r\nthat of the Council. \r\n The Security Council must abide strictly by the \r\nprovisions of the Charter and by all resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations. \r\n We call attention to the danger of interference by \r\nthe Security Council in matters that clearly fall under \r\nthe functions and powers of other principal United \r\nNations organs and their subsidiary bodies. Close \r\ncooperation and coordination among all principal \r\norgans is essential if the United Nations is to be able to \r\nremain relevant and face existing, new and future \r\ndangers and challenges. \r\n Cuba remains particularly concerned about the \r\nSecurity Council’s establishment of norms and \r\ndefinitions that go beyond its areas of competence. We \r\nreiterate that, under Article 13 of the Charter, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has primary responsibility for the \r\nprogressive development of international law and its \r\ncodification. We also stress that the Security Council’s \r\ndecision to initiate formal or informal debates on the \r\nsituation in any Member State or any matter that does \r\nnot constitute a threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity is contrary to Article 24 of the Charter. \r\n In that context, Cuba urges the Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the Security Council to hold regular debates and to \r\ncoordinate among themselves regarding the agendas \r\nand work programmes of those principal organs. That \r\nwill ensure increasing coherence and complementarity \r\namong them so that they are mutually reinforcing and \r\nrespect one another’s mandates. \r\n We urge the Security Council to take fully into \r\naccount the General Assembly’s recommendations in \r\nthe area of international peace and security, in \r\naccordance with paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the \r\nCharter. We are opposed to any attempt to transfer \r\nitems from the agenda of the Assembly or of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council to that of the Security \r\nCouncil, and to encroachment by the Council on the \r\nfunctions and powers of the Assembly. \r\n We need to make progress on Security Council \r\nreform as an integral part of the current process of \r\nUnited Nations reform. It is unacceptable to maintain \r\nthe status quo. Cuba supports the General Assembly’s \r\ndecision to continue its consideration of the issue of \r\nCouncil reform at its sixty-second session so as to \r\nachieve concrete results through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. \r\n Expansion of the Council’s membership should \r\naddress its lack of representation of developing \r\ncountries. At the same time, Council reform must not \r\nbe limited to the membership issue; it must also \r\naddress substantive issues related to the Council’s \r\nagenda, its working methods and its decision-making \r\nprocess. \r\n Transparency, openness and consistency are key \r\nprinciples that the Security Council must observe in all \r\nits activities, approaches and procedures. Regrettably, \r\nthe Council has failed to follow those important \r\nprinciples on many occasions. These cases include, \r\ninter alia, its reluctance to hold open debates on a \r\nnumber of very important issues and its restriction of \r\nparticipation in some open debates. \r\n The Council must comply with the provisions of \r\nArticle 31 of the Charter, which permit any country \r\nthat is a non-Council member to participate in debates \r\non matters that affect it. Closed meetings and informal \r\nconsultations must be kept to a minimum and should be \r\nthe exception, not the rule.  \r\n Cuba’s position is that the process of Security \r\nCouncil reform, which should be carried out in a \r\ncomprehensive, transparent and balanced manner, \r\nshould include the following objectives. We must \r\nensure that the Council’s agenda reflects the needs and \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n17 07-59318 \r\n \r\ninterests of both developing and developed countries, \r\nin an objective, rational, non-selective and non-\r\narbitrary manner. We must ensure that expanding the \r\nCouncil will help to make it a more democratic, \r\nrepresentative, responsible and effective organ. We \r\nmust ensure that the Council’s rules of procedure, \r\nwhich have remained provisional for 50 years, are \r\nformalized to enhance their transparency. And we must \r\ndemocratize the Council’s decision-making process, \r\nincluding by limiting the use of the veto with a view to \r\nits eventual elimination. In that context, the concept of \r\nvoluntary self-restraint is insufficient and cannot be \r\nconsidered an option. \r\n Cuba emphasizes the need to take the following \r\nmeasures. We must increase the number of the \r\nCouncil’s public meetings and ensure that they provide \r\nreal opportunities to take account of the opinions and \r\ncontributions of the greatest possible number of United \r\nNations Members, particularly non-Council members \r\nwhose affairs are being considered by the Council. \r\n The Council should allow briefings by the special \r\nenvoys or representatives of the Secretary-General and \r\nthe Secretariat to take place in public meetings, apart \r\nfrom exceptional circumstances, and further enhance \r\nits relationship with the Secretariat and troop-\r\ncontributing countries, including through sustained, \r\nregular and timely interaction. It should also ensure \r\nthat its subsidiary organs function in a manner that \r\nwould provide adequate and timely information on \r\ntheir activities to the general United Nations \r\nmembership. \r\n I would like to conclude by extending our best \r\nwishes for success to the incoming new members of the \r\nSecurity Council: Costa Rica, Croatia, Burkina Faso, \r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Vietnam. They can \r\nalways count on Cuba’s willingness to engage \r\nconstructively in consultations and negotiations \r\ntowards reforming the Council as an effective forum in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\n Mr. Al-Murad (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nshould like to extend my thanks and appreciation to the \r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of \r\nNovember, the Permanent Representative of Indonesia, \r\nMr. Marty Natalegawa, for his presentation of the \r\nCouncil’s report to the General Assembly (A/62/2). In \r\nthe report, the President of the Council affirms that the \r\nyear has seen a marked increase in the size and scope \r\nof the Council’s activities. In that regard, we also \r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Cuba on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n We also congratulate the newly elected \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council — the Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya, Burkina Faso, Viet Nam, Croatia and \r\nCosta Rica — for two-year terms beginning in 2008. \r\n The item currently under discussion by the \r\nGeneral Assembly is undoubtedly one of the most \r\nimportant items on its agenda, and last year’s intensive \r\ndeliberations on the subject of expanding the Security \r\nCouncil attest to that. Furthermore, the support of the \r\nheads of State and Government for the prompt reform \r\nof the Security Council, expressed in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome Document, is a fundamental element \r\nof the comprehensive effort to reform the United \r\nNations in order to make the Council more \r\nrepresentative, more efficient and more transparent. \r\nThat will consolidate the Council’s effectiveness and \r\nthe implementation of its resolutions, and is yet further \r\nproof of the importance that States Members of the \r\nOrganization attach to the issue of equitable \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council and the means to \r\nimprove its methods of work. \r\n The discussions of the Working Group over the \r\npast five years have highlighted the urgent need to \r\nrestructure the Security Council’s apparatus and to \r\nincrease the transparency of its procedures and \r\nmethods of work. However, despite the agreement in \r\nprinciple by Member States on the concept of making \r\nnecessary changes and reform, the Working Group has \r\nnot reached agreement on the substance of the changes \r\nthat should be made, despite the fact that 14 years have \r\nalready elapsed. \r\n Nevertheless, we cannot overlook the progress \r\nmade in the discussions of the Working Group with \r\nrespect to the procedures and the methods of work of \r\nthe Council. There is almost general agreement on \r\nmany of the measures and proposals sought, and there \r\nare even some procedures and methods of work that the \r\nCouncil itself has already begun to apply. \r\n We cannot but commend that improvement in the \r\nprocedures and methods of work of the Council, and \r\nexpress appreciation to Council members who were \r\nconscientious in periodically informing the rest of the \r\nmembership on developments in the Security Council’s \r\nimplementation of the concept of transparency. We also \r\ncommend the initiative of the President of the General \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 18 \r\n \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session, Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, to prompt discussions by the \r\nWorking Group in August of last year on the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. \r\n The position of the State of Kuwait vis-à-vis the \r\nissue of Security Council reform proceeds from the \r\nfollowing principles. First, Kuwait strongly supports \r\nthe activation and reform of all United Nations bodies, \r\nincluding the Security Council, in order to enable them \r\nto perform the main task entrusted to them by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations — the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Second, any change in the composition of the \r\nmembership of the Security Council must not affect its \r\nefficiency and effectiveness in taking decisions to \r\nconfront international threats and dangers. Any such \r\nchange must contribute to enhancing the legitimacy \r\nand credibility of the Council’s decisions. \r\n Third, with regard to reforming and improving \r\nthe procedures and working methods of the Council \r\nand to promoting its relations with other United \r\nNations bodies, such as the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, we support all proposals \r\nseeking to make the Council’s work more transparent \r\nand clear, and to facilitate the flow of information to \r\nand from the Member States of the United Nations. \r\nKuwait recognizes the need for full respect for the \r\nfunctions and powers of the principal organs, in \r\nparticular the General Assembly, and to define the \r\nCouncil’s role in discussing issues that threaten \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Fourth, we affirm the importance of codifying the \r\nmeasures taken by the Security Council in order to \r\nimprove its working methods without waiting for a \r\nconsensus to be reached on the other issues, such as the \r\nsize and composition of the Council and its decision-\r\nmaking process, especially since the codification of \r\nsuch measures will not necessarily entail any \r\namendment of the Charter. We also note that the time \r\nhas come for the Council to adopt permanent rules of \r\nprocedure. \r\n Fifth, Kuwait supports the maintenance of the \r\nmechanism to elect non-permanent members of the \r\nCouncil, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 23 \r\nof the Charter. That will improve opportunities for \r\nsmall States, of which we are one, to become members \r\nof the Council and contribute to its work. \r\n Sixth, as to the right of veto, we note the \r\nimportance of limiting and regulating the scope of its \r\nuse, inter alia, by restricting its application to issues \r\nthat fall under Chapter VII of the Charter. \r\n Finally, if an agreement on the increase of \r\nnon-permanent seats of the Council should be reached, \r\nthe distribution of those seats among the regional \r\ngroups must take into consideration the substantive \r\nincrease in the number of States in the Asian Group. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that an agreement can be \r\nreached on a consensual text satisfactory to all sides \r\nthat can guarantee the performance of the Council of \r\nits functions, pursuant to the Charter, without \r\nimpediment. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): Allow me at the outset to \r\nassociate myself with the statement to be delivered by \r\nthe Ambassador of Angola on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, and to express my deep appreciation to Sheikha \r\nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session, for her concerted \r\nefforts to push forward the issue of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and reform of the Security Council, \r\nparticularly since that important issue constitutes an \r\nintegral part of the comprehensive reform of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n I would also like to commend the five facilitators \r\nand the Ambassadors of Chile and Liechtenstein for \r\ntheir extensive efforts and valuable reports, which were \r\ncrowned by the adoption of the report of the Open-\r\nended Working Group containing its draft decision \r\nadopted by consensus. The delegation of Egypt looks \r\nforward to continued efforts on your part, Sir, to steer \r\nthe open-ended working group towards our common \r\naspiration for a successful resumption of deliberations \r\nduring the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n There is no doubt that the sixty-first session \r\nresulted in increasing momentum in dealing with the \r\nenlargement and reform of the Security Council in a \r\nmanner that raised the expectations of many on the \r\nprospect of reaching an agreement on a clear vision \r\nthat would garner the widest possible support of \r\nMember States. However, the positive nature of our \r\ndeliberations on the aforementioned issue, partly in \r\nlight of the reports of the facilitators and their \r\nstipulation of a set of alternatives, coincided with the \r\narduous attempts by some parties throughout the past \r\nsession to push the African continent to change its \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n19 07-59318 \r\n \r\nunambiguous position, enshrined in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and confirmed by subsequent African \r\nsummits, beginning with the Sert summit, rather than \r\nseek a consensus on the substantive issues under \r\nconsideration. \r\n In the aftermath of the submission of the two \r\nreports of the facilitators and the two ambassadors, and \r\nthe subsequent exhaustive deliberations that took place \r\non them, some voices were raised, emphasizing the \r\nneed to send a message to the last African summit in \r\nAccra, to convince African leaders to amend the \r\nAfrican position and to allow a greater degree of \r\nflexibility in dealing with some aspects of the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, especially the right of veto. The African \r\nleaders, however, decisively rejected those attempts \r\nand insisted on upholding the full implementation of \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus, with all its elements. The \r\nConsensus has represented and will continue to \r\nrepresent the just demands capable of rectifying the \r\nhistoric injustice against Africa caused by the denial of \r\nits legitimate right to permanent membership and the \r\nsubsequent inability of any of its States members of the \r\nSecurity Council to exercise the right of veto, despite \r\nthe continent’s numerical preponderance and the \r\ncomplexity of interests it seeks to defend in the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n In light of the failure of the attempts of those \r\nseeking to amend the common African position at the \r\nAccra summit, new alliances began to emerge between \r\nparties advancing only their national interests. They \r\nviewed draft resolution A/61/L.69 as a means to \r\ncircumvent the demands stipulated in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, especially its insistence that the right of \r\nveto be extended to the new permanent members as the \r\nmost important African demand insofar as what it \r\nrepresents with respect to increasing the ability of the \r\nAfrican continent to influence the work and resolutions \r\nof the Security Council. The African States were once \r\nagain able to keep their position intact and to reinstate \r\nthe right of veto in the focus of discussions in the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group in the next phase, side by \r\nside with the other elements enshrined in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, until Africa gets its equitable right to a just \r\nrepresentation that would allow it to influence Security \r\nCouncil dynamics. \r\n The events that unfolded during the discussion of \r\nthe report of the Open-ended Working Group in the \r\nsixty-first session necessitate an evaluation of what has \r\nbeen achieved so far, within a correct and substantive \r\nframework, in order to agree on a collective means by \r\nwhich we can achieve our common objectives of \r\nenlarging and reforming the Security Council at the \r\nearliest possible date, based on the widest possible \r\nagreement commensurate with the important nature of \r\nthat issue. The intermediate arrangements proposed by \r\nthe report of the five facilitators and the two \r\nambassadors introduced a number of alternatives under \r\neach of the five categories for discussion, allowing \r\neach party with a vested interest in the process to \r\nenvision the model that best suits its objective and \r\nmaterializes its aspirations in the enlargement process. \r\n It is time, therefore, to put those different \r\nalternatives to the test through all available \r\nmechanisms, as well as the diplomatic and political \r\ntools and capabilities at our disposal, including \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, as stipulated in the \r\ndecision adopted last year. Since our presence here is \r\nnot in a personal capacity, but rather as permanent \r\nrepresentatives of our Governments, we would like to \r\nstress that the mention of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations as one of the options for moving the \r\nprocess forward is merely an acknowledgement by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of an already existing mechanism. \r\nHence, our agreement or lack of agreement over any \r\nissue is to be understood within the framework of such \r\nnegotiations, carried out in either a principal or a \r\nsubsidiary organ of the United Nations. \r\n If such intergovernmental negotiations are to \r\nbegin on that very important issue, they should be \r\nbased on a clear vision put forward by a State or group \r\nof States, and only when that State or group of States \r\nhas the inherent conviction that the vision it advocates \r\ncan attain a very wide degree of support, exceeding the \r\nrequired two-thirds majority stipulated by the Charter. \r\nSuch a proposed vision should be negotiated and \r\nevaluated by all members of the General Assembly, but \r\nuntil one or a group of States can come up with such a \r\nvision, which we have been actively seeking to \r\nformulate for the past 14 years, it is Egypt’s view that \r\nthe President of the General Assembly should lead \r\nmore consultations — and I repeat consultations and \r\nnot negotiations — within the framework of the Open-\r\nended Working Group to narrow the difference in \r\npositions between the conflicting interests of all \r\nstakeholders. Such consultations could be undertaken \r\nwith the aim of reducing the number of alternatives \r\nstipulated under every category of the facilitators’ \r\nreports with a view to creating a positive environment \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 20 \r\n \r\nthat could lead to the eventual introduction of a vision \r\nthat could work as a basis for negotiations based on a \r\nproposal or proposals from Member States. \r\n This approach differs fundamentally from that of \r\nthe draft resolution sent by one of the aspiring nations \r\nonly to the African countries at the end of last week — \r\nand we all know why it was sent only to African \r\ncountries — in a new attempt to overcome the African \r\nposition set out in the Ezulwini Consensus. The draft \r\nresolution endeavours once again, unfortunately, to \r\nterminate the role of the Open-ended Working Group, \r\nthe most appropriate democratic framework \r\nincorporating all Member States, and to replace it by \r\ncalling upon the President of the General Assembly to \r\ninitiate intergovernmental negotiations in the same \r\nmanner that was rejected by Member States in draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69, submitted at the sixty-first \r\nsession.  \r\n Despite our great confidence in the wisdom and \r\nintegrity of the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session and in his ability to lead us to \r\nsuccess, the President’s neutrality, transparency and \r\nobjectivity in dealing with that sensitive issue and the \r\nfact that the President does not represent a Government \r\nrequire that we keep his high office away from this \r\nintergovernmental negotiating process. We should \r\nrather seek to enhance the President’s ability to \r\nconduct consultations, and not negotiations, within the \r\nframework of the Open-ended Working Group and in \r\nthe same successful manner followed by the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, and \r\neven more successfully. \r\n Our agreement on the inclusion of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations as one of the \r\nalternatives for considering the subject matter in the \r\ncoming phase should not be interpreted in any way as a \r\nrenunciation of the African position as defined in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus or as agreeing to limit our ability \r\nto address the question through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, distinct from other diplomatic means and \r\ncapabilities. It is merely derived from the desire to \r\nexplore all ways and means to guarantee the emergence \r\nof new creative options that might acquire the desired \r\nwide support. But to achieve that, we should not limit \r\nour discussions to interim arrangements, particularly as \r\nthe report of the facilitators itself opens the way for \r\neach State or group of States to maintain their original \r\npositions, if they believe that this is the ideal way to \r\nachieve the international objectives. Accordingly, \r\npositions of all stakeholders, described by the report of \r\nthe facilitators as “maximalist”, will continue to \r\nconstitute their formal positions, while, at the same \r\ntime, not affecting their ability to exert extra efforts to \r\nreach a compromise that meets the widest possible \r\nsupport. \r\n In this context, I would like to stress once again \r\nthat Egypt will not abandon the lofty interests of Africa \r\nin order to achieve narrow national goals. Our vision \r\nfor permanent membership is clear. It is based on the \r\nconviction that a permanent member without a veto \r\nright is merely a non-permanent member in the \r\nSecurity Council for an extended term — or forever. \r\nWe believe that permanent membership without a veto \r\nwill not change the balance or structure of power in the \r\nSecurity Council and will not accomplish the objective \r\nof protecting and defending African interests in the \r\nCouncil. Our perspective is based on the fact that \r\nAfrica legitimately deserves to have no less than two \r\npermanent seats and two additional non-permanent \r\nseats. Furthermore, we do not believe that the veto \r\nissue should be considered within reform of the \r\nworking methods, which should concentrate only on \r\npromoting the transparency and accountability of the \r\nSecurity Council when it addresses the interests of \r\nMember States. \r\n As Member States, we have to strive to surpass \r\nour national interests and have a more realistic vision \r\nconcerning our regional and international interests. It is \r\ntime to abandon the narrow coalitions of those who \r\nseek to impose particular views so as to achieve their \r\nnational interests. We should aim for global coalitions \r\nto achieve the international goal of creating a more \r\ndemocratic Security Council, a Council that better \r\nrepresents the general membership of the Organization. \r\nConsequently, we are looking forward to consultations \r\nunder the auspices of the President of the General \r\nAssembly, in his capacity as the Chair of the Open-\r\nended Working Group, and to any subsequent \r\nnegotiations, discussions or consultations that might \r\ntake place between Member States on any new \r\nsubstantive vision — submitted by a State or group of \r\nMember States with the aim of achieving the interests \r\nof all of us. We look for a collective understanding \r\nbetween the G4, the Uniting for Consensus group, the \r\nAfrican Group, and all others who have interests — the \r\nsmall States and islands States, developing and \r\ndeveloped countries and States representing different \r\ncultures and civilizations. All these represent the \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n21 07-59318 \r\n \r\nelements of diversity that could enhance the \r\nrepresentative character of the Council — thus \r\nachieving good governance at the international level, \r\nside by side with good governance at the national level. \r\n Egypt is confident that we will reach an \r\nexpansion of the Security Council on solid \r\nfoundations, built on solidifying the principles of \r\njustice and equality in rights and obligations, which \r\nwould, in turn, allow the Security Council to become a \r\nplatform for democracy and transparency that would \r\ndeal with matters involving Member States with due \r\nrespect and dignity. \r\n While expressing our sincere appreciation to \r\nMr. Natalegawa, the Permanent Representative of \r\nIndonesia, for presenting the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly, we note that \r\nthe report includes only brief references to the cases \r\nconsidered by the Council within the past year. African \r\nissues continued to be at the forefront of the Council’s \r\nagenda. The report mentioned briefly the developments \r\nthat have taken place in the countries concerned within \r\nthe year. Moreover, the report continues to follow the \r\nsame trend of previous years, which we have criticized \r\nseveral times. It includes only an enumeration of the \r\nmeetings and the documents of the Council. This \r\napproach lacks adequate scrutiny and evaluation of the \r\ndeliberations of the Council, the positions of its \r\nmembers and the motives behind its resolutions and the \r\npresidential and press statements issued by the \r\nCouncil.  \r\n Furthermore, the Council, despite our continued \r\nexpress concern, continues to interfere in the \r\ncompetence of the General Assembly, a matter which \r\nhas an impact on the sensitive balance between the \r\nmain organs of the Organization. Also, the failure of \r\nthe Security Council to act on some issues relating to \r\nthe maintenance of peace and security such as \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the \r\ncessation of hostilities between belligerent parties \r\nconstitute further sources of serious concern for us. \r\nThis was very clearly addressed in the Havana \r\nDeclaration by the heads of State and Government of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, which called for a greater \r\nrole of the General Assembly in addressing those \r\nissues when the Council fails to address them, owing to \r\na lack of unanimity among its permanent membership.  \r\n All of this confirms the necessity of expediting \r\nthe process of reforming the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council and of rapidly agreeing on the \r\nenlargement of its permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembership. This alone can conclude the process of \r\nreforming the United Nations, as we continue to \r\nbelieve that United Nations reform is not complete \r\nwithout the reform and expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n Mr. Voto-Bernales (Peru) (spoke In Spanish): As \r\nreflected in the report today before the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council experienced an \r\nincrease in the volume and scope of the questions on \r\nits agenda between 1 August 2006 and 31 July 2007. \r\nThis debate allows us to pause and reflect in the same \r\nconstructive spirit in which Peru has been participating \r\nin work of that body for more than 22 months. \r\n A large part of the heavy agenda of the Security \r\nCouncil consists of intrastate conflicts, which, for the \r\nmost part, take place in States marginalized from \r\nprogress, with weak institutions and precarious \r\ndevelopment indicators. In order to prevent these types \r\nof conflicts from multiplying and to prevent countries \r\nfrom relapsing into such situations, we continue to \r\nbelieve that the Council should address both the \r\nmilitary aspects and those of institutional rebuilding, \r\nwhich it has prioritized, as well as give attention to \r\nother structural factors, such as poverty, social \r\nexclusion, environmental degradation or transnational \r\ncrime.  \r\n While it is not our purpose to examine these cases \r\nin detail, we do need to recognize that the progress \r\nmade in Liberia, Sierra Leone or in Haiti require \r\nsubstantive action to address structural factors \r\ninvolved, so that these cases can become successful \r\nexperiences, as we all wish. Activities in this regard \r\nwill, of course, be consistent with the understanding \r\nagreed in the Outcome Document of the 2005 World \r\nSummit (A/RES/60/1) that development, peace and \r\nsecurity and human rights are interlinked and mutually \r\nreinforcing. \r\n We should also recall that, faced with the danger \r\nof more genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \r\ncrimes against humanity, we have the responsibility to \r\nprotect populations from these scourges. This requires \r\nus — the Member States of the United Nations and of \r\nthe Security Council in particular, to remain vigilant in \r\norder to effectively protect these populations, when the \r\nState called upon to do so cannot — or will not — \r\nfulfil its obligations. The International Criminal Court \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 22 \r\n \r\nis likewise a guarantee that those responsible for such \r\natrocities do not remain unpunished. For this reason, \r\nwe appeal to all countries to accede to the Rome \r\nStatute.  \r\n At the same time, inter-State conflicts that are \r\nstill not resolved, such as the question of Palestine or \r\ndemarcation between Eritrea and Ethiopia, continue to \r\ndeserve special attention. The indefinite persistence of \r\nthese and other such situations is highly injurious to \r\nthe key objectives of the Security Council in that \r\nrenewed efforts are required to achieve peace in the \r\nframework of international law and to fulfil \r\ncommitments of mutual respect. To this end, it is \r\nessential for the parties to have the will to resolve \r\nthem. \r\n As to elements that still await more effective \r\naction from the Security Council, Peru would reiterate \r\nits view that the United Nations needs to have available \r\nthe strategic reserve force which would enable Blue \r\nHelmets to be deployed with the necessary urgency. \r\nSome of the situations considered in the present report \r\nof the Council, for example, could have been handled \r\nwith great diligence had such a reserve force existed.  \r\n Equally acute is the need to strengthen \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation regimes of nuclear, \r\nchemical and biological weapons and related systems. \r\nPeru supports the actions of the Security Council \r\naimed at avoiding proliferation among State and \r\nnon-State actors and at the same time believes that the \r\nmultilateral system should redouble its efforts with this \r\npurpose in mind and make progress on the collective \r\ncommitments entered into. We need the development \r\nof cooperative security to buttress the structures of \r\npeace and security and to avoid arms races globally, \r\nregionally and subregionally. \r\n Terrorism has grown into a scourge of universal \r\nscope that needs to be condemned and combated \r\nwithout concessions. In whatever guise or shape, \r\nwhatever may be its motivation, terrorism is \r\nunacceptable. In this fight, the multilateral system has \r\ngiven itself 13 international conventions, in addition to \r\nregional agreements and a global counter-terrorism \r\nstrategy. In this regard, resolute action on the part of \r\nthe Security Council is vital to facing this threat. The \r\ncommitment of every State should be unequivocal. We \r\nmust cooperate to ensure that States have available the \r\noperative capabilities, above all, of intelligence and \r\npolice capacity, as key parts in this struggle, while at \r\nthe same time preserving unlimited respect for human \r\nrights.  \r\n Likewise, there are other factors which require \r\nthe Council’s continued attention since they influence \r\nconflicts, such as the action of irregular armed groups, \r\nillegal trade in small arms and light weapons, \r\nsmuggling of natural resources, drug trafficking and \r\nother ways in which organized crime weakens \r\ninstitutions, undermines social stability, jeopardizes \r\ndemocracy and threatens security. \r\n At the same time, Peru believes that it essential to \r\nrecognize, in particular, the role of the environment in \r\nthe preservation of international security. Climate, \r\nwater and forests are very distinct elements for which \r\nwe need to build strategies and specific and \r\ndifferentiated actions if we are to avoid a worsening in \r\nthe depredation of resources, deforestation, pollution, \r\nand sudden changes in climate and radiation, inter alia, \r\nthat have an impact on the subsistence of certain \r\npopulations and on the quality of life, present and \r\nfuture, of the whole planet. \r\n On these factors it is not the purview of the \r\nSecurity Council to play a normative role, nor is it \r\nwithin its jurisdiction to negotiate and adopt universal \r\ncommitments that need to be adopted in other forums \r\nand mechanisms. But it is necessary for these factors to \r\nbe duly considered — in their security dimension — in \r\nspecific cases on the agenda of the Council. \r\n Likewise, we are convinced that the wide range \r\nof threats to peace and security and their \r\ninterrelationship demand the assistance of other \r\nmultilateral agencies and regional organizations and \r\nthe active participation of the private sector and civil \r\nsociety, within their respective responsibilities, in order \r\nto tackle them. This approach will make the work of \r\nthe Security Council more consistently effective and \r\nwill situate its work in a perspective of cooperation \r\nwith the multilateral system in the event of a possible \r\nconflict.  \r\n Before concluding, I would like to make the point \r\nthat as far as Peru is concerned it is particularly \r\ngratifying to coordinate in the Council the work on the \r\nmandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \r\nHaiti. While part of this work, such as the recent \r\nadoption of resolution 1780 (2007), will be reflected in \r\nnext year’s report, I would like to reaffirm our \r\nrecognition to the delegation of Haiti, the Group of \r\nFriends, the States that make up the 2x9 mechanism of \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n23 07-59318 \r\n \r\ntroop-contributing countries and the remaining \r\nmembers of the Security Council, together with whom \r\nit has been possible to achieve an agreement to \r\ncontinue supporting the process to restore security and \r\nrebuild the institutions of this fraternal country of the \r\nCaribbean. \r\n Peru, as a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil, discharges its responsibility and complies \r\nwith the approaches guiding its foreign policy. On the \r\nbasis of its own economic and social realities, its \r\nregional outreach and its profound commitment to \r\nmultilateralism, Peru will continue from this Assembly \r\nand other bodies helping to constructively build \r\ninternational peace and security, respect for \r\ninternational law, and the promotion of economic and \r\nsocial development, as well as the defence and \r\nfostering of human rights, democracy and freedoms in \r\nthe world.  \r\n Mr. Argüello (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nwish to thank you, Sir, first of all, for convening this \r\ndebate on agenda items 9 and 122. The role of the \r\nSecurity Council in buttressing international peace and \r\nsecurity is clearly key. We welcome the report of the \r\nCouncil (A/62/2) and thank the Indonesian presidency \r\nfor introducing it. Our country was a member of the \r\nCouncil for part of the period covered by the report and \r\nwe were witnesses and protagonists in the efforts of the \r\nSecurity Council in carrying out its mandate under the \r\nCharter. \r\n We are following with concern the most grave \r\nincidents affecting international peace and security \r\nand, in particular, we would like to draw attention to \r\nthe situation in Darfur, in Somalia and in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. We do hope that \r\nthe upcoming Annapolis conference will make real \r\nprogress aimed at achieving a just and legitimate \r\nsolution to the conflict in the Middle East within \r\ninternational law, as established by the various \r\nresolutions of the Security Council. We are aware of \r\nthe gravity of situations that place restrictions on \r\nfreedoms and that violate human rights in many \r\ncountries.  \r\n As regards the question of the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, we believe that we always need to \r\nkeep this issue as a priority on our agenda. Every day \r\nthat passes without reform makes that body more \r\nillegitimate and more anachronistic — illegitimate \r\nbecause it fails to represent a membership of 192 \r\nMembers, and anachronistic because it manifests an \r\nhistorical reality that goes back 60 years.  \r\n We have looked at the proposals of the \r\nfacilitators of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly in the report of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security \r\nCouncil (A/61/47). The ways and means suggested are, \r\nin our opinion, the only ones that offer reasonableness \r\nand the potential to make progress and to emerge from \r\nthe impasse that has been in place for some years. They \r\ninclude formulas for intermediate expansion that will \r\nnot leave everyone satisfied for now, but which present \r\na possible way out, creating a testing ground, getting \r\nus out of inertia and the status quo. \r\n The intermediary approach, which might last 10, \r\n15 or 20 years, would make it possible to increase the \r\nmembership and the participation of all categories of \r\ncountries and would, in particular, ensure effective \r\naccess by small States to the Security Council. I wish \r\nto mention the importance of both rotation and \r\nincreasing the regional factor, as much in terms of \r\nelection methods — including the accountability \r\ninvolved in re-election — as in terms of coordinating \r\npositions. We must advance at the regional level, \r\nincreasing confidence and cooperation without being \r\ndivided by hegemonies or power politics. An \r\nintermediary way also provides an opportunity for the \r\nfive permanent members to heed the voices of the great \r\nmajority, which wants to improve the working methods \r\nof the Council, controlled today by a small group of \r\ncountries. \r\n This year, in the Open-ended Working Group, we \r\nnoted that only a catastrophe such as the Second World \r\nWar could create a system of privileges such as that \r\nheld by the permanent five. Today’s world, fortunately, \r\ndoes not present a similar justifying scenario at a time \r\nwhen armed conflicts and social conflicts persist and \r\nthere is a sustainability crisis to a degree previously \r\nunknown in history. I believe that the next stage should \r\nsee us ending our speech-making and unilateral \r\nactions. In the Open-ended Working Group we must \r\nfocus on procedures, formats and modalities that \r\nsupport negotiation. This stage, which may also be \r\ncalled pre-negotiation, should be tackled creatively and \r\nwith the greatest possible political agreement. That is \r\nthe pathway to compromise. \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 24 \r\n \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nBelarus delegation would like to thank the Security \r\nCouncil for the report on its work (A/62/2). The work \r\nof the Council is given priority attention by the \r\ndelegation of virtually each Member State. \r\n Belarus closely follows the reactions of the \r\nCouncil to threats to international peace and security. \r\nIn that context, it may be unnecessary for the Council, \r\nwhen preparing its annual report, to enumerate the \r\nactivities it has undertaken. United Nations Member \r\nStates expect to receive an analytical — rather than \r\ninformational — document that contains in-depth \r\nanalysis of situations in various hot spots of the world \r\nand of the international situation as a whole. We \r\nunderstand that the preparation of that kind of outcome \r\ndocument could cause some difficulties because of the \r\nneed to reach agreement between delegations and \r\nmember States of the Council. We would suggest as a \r\nfirst stage, therefore, that more attention be given to \r\nthe analytical component when preparing the monthly \r\nreports of delegations presiding over the Council for a \r\ngiven month. \r\n Once again we are discussing the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Such reform should make it more \r\nrepresentative, more effective and more transparent. \r\nThe Open-ended Working Group is doing some \r\nimportant, meticulous work to make real progress in \r\ndefining concrete formulas for expanding the \r\nmembership of the Council. We support its activities \r\nand are prepared to continue to lend the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group every possible assistance. \r\n Today it is clear that, since the Council was \r\ncreated, as a parallel system for organizing the world, \r\nthe United Nations itself has changed. Enhancing the \r\neffectiveness and the authority of the Security Council \r\nshould be accomplished in a manner that reflects \r\ncontemporary geopolitical realities. We are therefore \r\nspeaking of broader political participation by States in \r\nthe decision-making of the Council. The reform of the \r\nSecurity Council should take place primarily in \r\nimportant areas such as the expansion of its \r\nmembership and improving its methods of work. \r\nHowever, we believe that the Council should remain a \r\ncompact and effective organ that is able to react in a \r\ntimely and effective manner to threats to international \r\npeace and security.  \r\n The reform of the Council should not be confined \r\nmerely to an arithmetical increase in composition. The \r\npoint of the reform is for the expansion to make the \r\nCouncil more authoritative and more representative. \r\nAccordingly, we continue to support the idea of the \r\nCouncil adopting decisions if they are supported by \r\ntwo-thirds of those voting. It would be a correct step \r\npolitically and logically. Having that kind of a system \r\nin place for decision-making in the Security Council \r\nwould be in keeping with the rules adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly with regard to the adoption of \r\nimportant decisions concerning the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Belarus continues to favour the granting of an \r\nadditional seat in the category of non-permanent \r\nmember in a new expanded Council to the Eastern \r\nEuropean regional group. We also believe that \r\ncountries representing the African, Asian and Latin \r\nAmerican regions are underrepresented in the \r\nCouncil’s current composition. Belarus is in favour of \r\ngiving them an additional seat in that body in the \r\npermanent member category. \r\n The founding fathers of the United Nations \r\nplaced the primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security upon the Security \r\nCouncil. The Council was conceived as an organ that \r\ncould take decisive steps to prevent and remove threats \r\nto international peace and security. It was created, not \r\njust to be representative but to be a responsible organ \r\nwith the capacity to take decisive, appropriate action \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nIndividual cases of the Council’s inability to take \r\ntimely and effective steps on questions relating to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security show \r\nthat it is precisely the reform of the Council that would \r\nallow it to carry out its basic functions more \r\neffectively, as the guarantor of peace and security.  \r\n Attempts made by some members of the Council \r\nto unjustifiably expand the agenda by adding items that \r\ndo not fall within its competence reduce the \r\neffectiveness of its work and often undermine the \r\nauthority of the Security Council. Accordingly, we \r\nthink it is important to restore the balance of \r\nresponsibility between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Belarus believes that the Security \r\nCouncil should improve its working methods. That \r\narea of Council reform should be discussed within any \r\nreform package. Even if agreement is not reached on \r\nother areas of reform of the Council, efforts to improve \r\nthe working methods of the Council must absolutely be \r\nmade. \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n25 07-59318 \r\n \r\n In a new reformed Council, a crucial issue to be \r\nconsidered is the broader involvement of States that are \r\nnon-members of the Council in its work. In our view, \r\nthat would enhance the accountability of the Council to \r\nall Member States of the United Nations and would \r\nmake its work more transparent. Member States should \r\nhave direct access to Council meetings, in particular in \r\ncases when their interests are directly affected or where \r\nagenda items are discussed that have a direct \r\nrelationship to those countries.  \r\n The ongoing and often emotional debates about \r\nexpanding the Council have shown that there are \r\nadvocates and opponents of various plans for Council \r\nreform. The presence of those different views among \r\nMember States on that issue is something that Belarus \r\nsees as a natural phenomenon. It is a normal feature of \r\nan on-going negotiating process. In our view it is \r\nimportant to reach the broadest possible unity of views \r\nthrough consultation and dialogue. However, the \r\nreform process should not be discontinued because of \r\ndifficulties and because of a lack of conformity in \r\napproach. The reform of the Council will move \r\nforward and will work to the extent that Member States \r\nshow enough political will, are sufficiently aware of \r\ntheir responsibility and have enough energy, resources \r\nand attention to advance and carry out that important \r\ncause. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in French): First \r\nof all allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on the way \r\nyou are conducting the debate. My delegation also \r\nwishes to thank the Ambassador of Indonesia, the \r\nPresident of the Security Council for this month, for \r\nhaving submitted the report of the Security Council \r\ntoday (A/62/2) to the General Assembly pursuant to the \r\nrelevant provisions of the United Nations Charter. \r\n My delegation would like to make the following \r\ncomments on the two items on the agenda of today’s \r\nplenary meeting, namely, “Report of the Security \r\nCouncil” and “Question of equitable representation on \r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters”. \r\n I need hardly recall that the General Assembly’s \r\nconsideration of the item on the report of the Security \r\nCouncil is the only opportunity for States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, in particular for those of us that are \r\nnot members of the Security Council, to consider in \r\ndepth the activities of that organ and to identify \r\nmeasures that should be taken to make the required \r\nimprovements to its working methods.  \r\n My delegation is pleased to see that, in terms of \r\nformat, the Security Council’s report for this reporting \r\nperiod (A/62/2), contains an analytical introduction in \r\naddition to the normal statistics. However, efforts \r\nshould continue to further improve the quality of the \r\nreport which clearly remains a compilation of the \r\ndecisions and resolutions that were adopted and a \r\nrather factual description of the Council’s work.  \r\n We are far from what was recommended by \r\nMember States to have an annual analytical report. \r\nAccordingly, it should be noted that the General \r\nAssembly has asked the Security Council to \r\nperiodically submit to it special thematic reports on \r\nquestions of international interest. To date, no report of \r\nthat kind has been submitted. \r\n Turning to the functioning of the Council, we are \r\npleased to note that during the reporting period the \r\nSecurity Council held a large number of open meetings \r\nduring which a greater number of States participated. \r\nWe note also a definite increase in public briefings, \r\nwhich have given non-members of the Council the \r\npossibility of being briefed, albeit partially, about \r\ndevelopments concerning some of the matters of which \r\nthe Council is seized. Having said that, we are \r\nconvinced that much remains to be done to make the \r\nfunctioning of the Council more transparent, which \r\nwould guarantee access to information to all \r\ndelegations, in particular, delegations that have items \r\non the Council’s agenda. \r\n Likewise, I would like to come back to the \r\nquestion of the proliferation of public meetings on \r\nmatters that fall more within the mandates of other \r\nUnited Nations organs such as the General Assembly \r\nand the Economic and Social Council. In this regard, it \r\nremains useful to strengthen the regular consultation \r\nmechanisms between the Presidents of United Nations \r\norgans in order to remedy any encroachment or \r\ninterference. \r\n On questions of substance, the report of the \r\nSecurity Council shows that that organ has acted with \r\ndetermination to address a number of conflicts around \r\nthe world, and in particular on the African continent. \r\nThat enhances the Council’s authority and role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.  \r\nA/62/PV.47  \r\n \r\n07-59318 26 \r\n \r\n But the efforts of the Council fall short of \r\nexpectations in the Middle East. Frustration at the \r\nCouncil’s repeated failure to become more involved in \r\nsettling the question of Palestine and to shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities in that area poses a serious threat to the \r\nregion and to the authority of the Council itself. \r\n With regard to the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council, allow me, Mr. President, first of \r\nall, to pay high tribute to your predecessor, the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, and to her \r\nfacilitators, including my colleague, the former \r\nPermanent Representative of Tunisia, for their \r\noutstanding contribution to the item under discussion \r\ntoday. \r\n The conclusions and recommendations that they \r\nsubmitted to Member States last spring allowed the \r\nprocess of consultation to be relaunched, in particular \r\nby means of proposing a new approach to unfreeze the \r\nstatus quo and to resolve the dilemma of expanding the \r\nSecurity Council, which has persisted for more than 15 \r\nyears. My delegation welcomes the agreement reached \r\nby Member States in early September, within the \r\nframework of the report of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security \r\nCouncil (A/61/47), whereby we decided to continue \r\nconsideration of the question of the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council  \r\n “so that further concrete results may be achieved, \r\nincluding through intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nbuilding on the progress achieved so far, ... as \r\nwell as the positions of and proposals made by \r\nMember States”. (see A/61/47, para. 21) \r\n Looking forward to the implementation of that \r\nunderstanding this year, under your guidance, \r\nMr. President, allow me to make the following point. \r\nMy country believes that the purpose of any reform of \r\nthe Security Council is to strengthen equitable \r\nrepresentation in that body, bolster its credibility and \r\nenhance its effectiveness. The Security Council must \r\nreflect the political and economic realities of today’s \r\nworld. It should be given the legitimacy it needs to act \r\non behalf of the international community in carrying \r\nout its mandate under the Charter. \r\n These objectives will be unattainable without \r\nexpansion, in particular for the benefit of developing \r\ncountries. The size of the restructured Council should \r\nreflect all of the sensitivities of the international \r\ncommunity. In this context, Tunisia continues to \r\nstrongly support the position of the African Union as \r\nreflected in the African consensus on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, which to date remains unchanged. \r\n In our view there must be an immediate remedy \r\nof the long-standing injustice which has denied Africa \r\na permanent presence in the Security Council. There is \r\nhardly any need to recall that this unjust situation has \r\nbeen going on since the establishment of the United \r\nNations. We would support any formula that would \r\ngive developing countries in general, and Africa in \r\nparticular, the role due them on the Security Council. \r\n Finally, the question of the periodic review of the \r\nSecurity Council, once it has been expanded and \r\nreformed, is an essential factor of the reform \r\nprogramme. This consideration will help to build \r\nconfidence that will allow us to make the adjustments \r\nthat might be necessary in the future, but still more \r\nimportant, it represents a mechanism through which we \r\nwould be able to assess the contribution of the new \r\nmembers to enhancing the effectiveness of the Council. \r\n In conclusion, we believe that, in order to \r\ncontinue to enjoy the trust of Member States and of \r\nworld public opinion, the Security Council should \r\ndemonstrate that it is in a position to effectively tackle \r\nthe most difficult questions, including by becoming \r\nmore representative of the international community as \r\na whole and of the realities of today’s world. It is time \r\nto embark on that path in a determined and serious \r\nmanner.  \r\n \r\nOrganization of work \r\n \r\n The President: I should like now to consult \r\nMember States regarding an extension for the work of \r\nthe Sixth Committee. Members will recall that, at its \r\nsecond plenary meeting, on 21 September 2007, the \r\nGeneral Assembly approved the recommendation of the \r\nGeneral Committee that the Sixth Committee would \r\ncomplete its work by Thursday, 15 November 2007. \r\nHowever, I have been informed by the Chairman of the \r\nSixth Committee that the Committee has not been able \r\nto finish its work by Thursday, 15 November, and will \r\nneed an additional meeting on 19 November 2007, \r\ndepending on the availability of Conference Services. \r\n A/62/PV.47\r\n \r\n27 07-59318 \r\n \r\nMay I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to extend the work of the Sixth Committee for \r\none additional meeting? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: I wish finally to inform the \r\nGeneral Assembly that in addition to the items \r\nscheduled for Thursday morning, 15 November 2007, \r\nthe Assembly will take up the reports of the Fifth \r\nCommittee contained in documents A/62/528, \r\nA/62/529, A/62/530, A/62/531, A/62/532 and A/62/533 \r\non sub-item (a), “Appointment of members of the \r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary \r\nQuestions”; sub-item (b), “Appointment of members of \r\nthe Committee on Contributions”; sub-item (c), \r\n“Confirmation of the appointment of members of the \r\nInvestments Committee”; sub-item (d), “Appointment \r\nof a member of the Board of Auditors”; sub-item (e), \r\n“Appointment of members of the United Nations \r\nAdministrative Tribunal”, and sub-item (f), \r\n“Appointment of members of the Independent Audit \r\nAdvisory Committee”, of agenda item 114, \r\nrespectively. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n"
