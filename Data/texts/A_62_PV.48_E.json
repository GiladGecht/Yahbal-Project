(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 9 and 122 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/62/2) \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters \r\n \r\n Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): I am particularly \r\nhonoured to address this Assembly on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group regarding a question of particular \r\ninterest to our continent, which is Security Council \r\nreform. Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this \r\nmeeting, as this matter remains unfinished business. \r\n I would like to commend the Indonesian \r\npresidency for the presentation of the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/2). The African Group also \r\ntakes note with appreciation of the notification by the \r\nSecretary-General under Article 12, paragraph 2, of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations concerning matters \r\nrelative to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity included on the agenda of the Council \r\n(A/62/300). \r\n The Security Council report submitted to us \r\ndevotes an important place to the African continent, \r\nsince African issues continue to be, as rightly referred \r\nto in the report, at the forefront of the Council’s \r\nagenda. Despite the prevalence of conflicts, positive \r\ndevelopments are occurring in several countries in \r\npost-conflict situations, changing the gloomy picture \r\nsometimes presented of the continent to the world. We \r\nare pleased that the Security Council has regularly kept \r\non its agenda the consideration of post-conflict \r\nsituations in those countries. \r\n The African Group welcomes in particular the \r\nSecurity Council’s adoption of a presidential statement \r\n(S/PRST/2007/42) on its relations with regional \r\norganizations in matters relating to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. With regard to the \r\nAfrican Union (AU), the Security Council’s mission to \r\nthe AU’s headquarters at Addis Ababa has enabled a \r\nvery productive exchange of views on matters of \r\nmutual interest. The African Group therefore \r\nencourages the two bodies to continue that dialogue in \r\norder to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes \r\nin the area of peace and security. \r\n While addressing the Security Council last week \r\non behalf of the African Group in the debate devoted to \r\nthe role of regional and subregional organizations in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\n(see S/PV.5776), I mentioned that Africa has been the \r\nstage for useful experiences in the areas of \r\npeacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding — and, \r\nconsequently, for the work of the Security Council. \r\nHowever, Africa is also fully aware of a central issue \r\ninvolving its relationship with the Council: the \r\ncontinent is not adequately represented in the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n The time has therefore come to redress the \r\nhistorical injustice done to Africa, in order to close a \r\nchapter that followed two world wars and to move \r\nforward in the search for collective security by \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 2 \r\n \r\nworking together in a more inclusive, transparent and \r\ndemocratic manner. For that reason, and in conformity \r\nwith the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, \r\nAfrica is asking for not less than two permanent seats \r\non the Council — with all the prerogatives and \r\nprivileges of permanent membership, including the \r\nright of the veto — in addition to five non-permanent \r\nseats. It would be the responsibility of the African \r\nUnion to select Africa’s representatives on the Security \r\nCouncil — a question to be given due consideration in \r\naccordance with acceptable criteria to be determined \r\ncollectively at the level of the African Union and the \r\nUnited Nations, respectively. Africa is in principle \r\nopposed to the veto, but, if it is to be maintained, it \r\nshould be made available to all permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council as a matter of justice. The \r\nEzulwini Consensus is an integrated package that \r\ncontains all the elements to which I have referred. \r\n While addressing the General Assembly at the \r\nopening of its sixty-second session, Mr. President, you \r\nrightly stated that \r\n “If we want the United Nations to play its \r\nfull role, we will have to do more and do it more \r\neffectively — both operationally at the country \r\nlevel and with regard to management at \r\nHeadquarters. We also need the courage to move \r\nto a new stage leading to concrete results on \r\nSecurity Council reform”. (A/62/PV.1, p. 2) \r\nWe fully endorse that view, and we commend you for \r\nyour foresight and courage. You can therefore count on \r\nthe support of the African Group. \r\n The African Group is committed to strengthening \r\nthe United Nations, including the Security Council, \r\nwhose thorough reform will enable it to be more \r\nlegitimate, representative and effective and, \r\nconsequently, in a better position to perform its \r\nprimary responsibility as provided for by the Charter of \r\nthe Organization. \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): First, let me thank His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Marty M. Natalegawa, \r\nPermanent Representative of Indonesia, for his \r\nintroduction this morning of the report (A/62/2) of the \r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly covering the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2006 to 31 July 2007. \r\n Finland is a firm supporter of comprehensive \r\nSecurity Council reform. It is imperative that we build \r\nupon the work already done during previous sessions \r\nof the General Assembly and take the Security Council \r\nreform process forward. A process must be put in place \r\nthat keeps the discussion going and achieves concrete \r\nprogress soon. We support you, Mr. President, in your \r\nefforts to facilitate that process. \r\n Finland views Security Council reform as an \r\nessential element of the comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. Despite the progress made in many \r\nareas of overall United Nations reform, Security \r\nCouncil reform has not advanced. In order to \r\nstrengthen the credibility and legitimacy of the United \r\nNations system, we need to proceed on that reform as \r\nwell. \r\n The reform of the Council must aim at increasing \r\nboth its legitimacy and its effectiveness. The Council \r\nshould better represent today’s world community. The \r\nnumber of both permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers should be increased, without extending the \r\nright of the veto. It is also important to guarantee the \r\npossibility of smaller States having an opportunity to \r\nserve in the Security Council. As an important part of \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council, the \r\nreform of its working methods and procedures is also \r\nvital. \r\n A more representative, and therefore more \r\nlegitimate, Council will also be more effective in \r\ncarrying out its functions. It is now important to take \r\nthe much-needed next step under your able guidance, \r\nMr. President. \r\n Mr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like to express our deep \r\ngratitude to the President of the Security Council for \r\nthe month of November for his valuable introduction \r\nthis morning of the annual report of the Council \r\n(A/62/2). I would also like to thank the former \r\nChairperson and facilitators of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the \r\nSecurity Council for their outstanding efforts in \r\nmanaging the meetings of the Group during the \r\nprevious session. I wish the Group every success in \r\npursuing its important role in reaching solutions \r\nthrough compromise that will help to strengthen the \r\nrole and effectiveness of the Security Council in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n Over the decades, the Security Council has made \r\nsubstantial efforts to maintain international peace and \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n3 07-59062 \r\n \r\nsecurity, to contain numerous emergencies, complex \r\ninternal crises and regional and international tensions, \r\nto combat terrorism; to prevent war crimes, genocide \r\nand human rights violations, to build peace in post-\r\nconflict areas, to prevent the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, and to \r\naddress other aggravated security challenges that pose \r\na threat to human survival. Nevertheless, the outcome \r\nof these efforts and endeavours failed to meet our \r\nexpectations and was associated, in some cases, with \r\nmultifaceted failures to address some important matters \r\non its agenda. This presented obstacles to the solution \r\nof certain issues, relating to the transparency of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. The Security Council \r\ndemonstrated total silence in certain cases of emerging \r\nsecurity developments that threatened international \r\npeace and security, and it exceeded its mandate in some \r\ncases as specified in the Charter. There has also been \r\nexcessive resort to Chapter VII of the Charter to \r\naddress issues that do not necessarily pose an imminent \r\nthreat to international peace and security. Additionally, \r\nthe Security Council has intentionally fallen short in \r\npursuing other resolutions relating to more pressing \r\nsecurity issues, such as the developments in Palestine \r\nand the Middle East, which have been on the agenda of \r\nthe Council since its establishment. \r\n As we consider the inconsistencies in the current \r\nactions of the Security Council, we can see that they \r\nstem from its uneven structure, which was based on the \r\ninternational political and geographical reality of 1945, \r\nwith some amendments made in 1963. In light of the \r\ncurrent political, geographical, demographic and \r\neconomic developments in the twenty-first century, we \r\nemphasize the importance of enabling the Security \r\nCouncil to play its natural and effective role of \r\nshouldering responsibility to orient international \r\nrelations and implement international law, which \r\nrequires urgent action to redress, in a systematic \r\nmanner, the shortcomings in its working methods, as \r\nwell as to ensure a total change in its structure and its \r\nresponse to today’s regional and international political, \r\ngeographical and economic changes and events. \r\n My country has closely monitored all initiatives \r\nand deliberations held thus far at the bilateral and \r\nregional geographical levels and all formal and \r\ninformal consultations organized by the General \r\nAssembly, including those pertaining to submitted draft \r\nresolutions. We also have followed other inclusive \r\ndiscussions held by facilitators appointed by the former \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and whose results \r\nwere reflected in a final report issued last September. \r\nMy country is deeply concerned with the unilateral \r\npositions expressed by some countries on this matter, \r\nwhich have prolonged the inability of the international \r\ncommunity to achieve any progress and have increased \r\nthe complexity of the matter on more than one level. \r\n We therefore call on all concerned parties, \r\nincluding States and regional and political groups, to \r\nshow the necessary political will and reflect a flexible, \r\ntransparent and open approach in order to bring \r\ntogether disparate views and achieve international \r\nconsensus on this matter. Our consultations must cover \r\nall aspects of this matter as an integral part of the \r\ncomprehensive reform process of the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n In this context, we also reiterate our position in \r\nfavour of increasing the permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembership of the Security Council. This expansion \r\nshould be based on the principles of the sovereign \r\nequality of States and equitable and fair geographical \r\nrepresentation. It should also ensure the required \r\npolitical international balance in the representation of \r\nsmall and developing countries, so as to reflect the \r\nconcerns and interests of all peoples and all regions. \r\nWe also call for the allocation of one permanent seat, \r\nin addition to at least two non-permanent seats, to the \r\nGroup of Arab States, which would be filled on a \r\nrotating basis and in accordance with the practices \r\nendorsed by the League of Arab States in the \r\nframework of consultations and discussions with both \r\nthe Group of African States and the Group of Asian \r\nStates. \r\n Efforts to reform the Security Council must not \r\nfocus only on the size of an enlarged Council or on \r\nmembership categories or regional representation, but \r\nalso on other important issues such as the development \r\nof its agenda and its procedures and working methods, \r\nincluding its process of international decision-making \r\nand its relationship with other international entities. \r\nThese reforms should also take into consideration the \r\nneeds and interests of both developing and developed \r\ncountries in a reasonable, objective, non-arbitrary and \r\nnon-selective manner. Therefore, we support open \r\nviews expressed in this regard, including efforts aimed \r\nat achieving an early reform in the Security Council in \r\naccordance with the Outcome Document of the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 4 \r\n \r\n In this context we request, first, the establishment \r\nof checks and balances on the use of the veto in order \r\nto reduce its use and commit the Security Council to \r\nsubmitting reports to the General Assembly on matters \r\nin which the right of veto was used. This would help in \r\nevaluating and overruling this right under the agenda \r\nitem entitled “United for Peace” and in accordance \r\nwith the progressive interpretation of Articles 11, \r\n24 (1) and 35 of the United Nations Charter. This \r\nwould ensure an impartial and democratic decision-\r\nmaking process within the Council, particularly on \r\ncomplicated and emergency matters in which urgent \r\naction is needed in order to avoid bloodshed and \r\nprotect innocent lives and property, in pursuance of the \r\nprinciples of the Charter, the foundations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the 1949 Geneva \r\nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian \r\nPersons in Time of War. \r\n Secondly, the Council should not, in accordance \r\nwith Articles 41 and 42 of Chapter VII of the Charter, \r\nimpose sanctions except for cases of aggression that \r\npose an imminent threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity. Sanctions should be imposed only after all \r\nother peaceful means have been exhausted, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of Chapters VI and VIII \r\nof the Charter, and only after elaborated extensive \r\nstudies on their direct and indirect consequences in the \r\nshort and long-term. This will help to avoid the risk of \r\nthese sanctions turning into collective punishments on \r\ntargeted States that punish innocent populations. \r\n Thirdly, we also call for expanded opportunities \r\nfor non-member States to participate in the activities of \r\nthe Security Council and in activities that are directly \r\nrelated to matters under the Council’s consideration. \r\nThis would include countries whose interests are \r\ndirectly affected by its resolutions or countries that \r\ncontribute to its peacekeeping operations with troops or \r\nequipment. We also believe there should be an increase \r\nin the number of open plenary meetings, particularly \r\nthose involving draft resolutions on the deployment of \r\npeacekeeping missions in accordance with Articles 31 \r\nand 33 of the Charter and in the issuance of special, \r\nperiodic and annual reports based on facts and \r\ndocumented information as well as analytic context in \r\naccordance with paragraph 3 of Article 24 of the \r\nCharter. \r\n Fourthly, we must formalize the Security \r\nCouncil’s rules of procedure in order to improve the \r\nCouncil’s transparency and accountability, including \r\nnon-infringement on the mandates of other regional \r\nand international entities and organs, such as the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, in accordance with the Charter. The Security \r\nCouncil should strengthen its coordination with those \r\norgans so as to enhance its capacity and means to \r\ncontain existing disputes and conflicts and prevent \r\ntheir serious implications for humankind from \r\nbecoming realities. \r\n We hope that our ongoing deliberations on this \r\nitem will lead to a common and practical international \r\napproach in carrying out substantial and positive \r\nreform of the Security Council so that it can meet \r\ntoday’s growing challenges in the area of international \r\npeacemaking and protect humanity from the \r\ndestruction of war and the gross violations of human \r\nrights, and other grave threats in today’s world. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nshould like to thank the Ambassador of Indonesia, \r\nPresident of the Security Council, for presenting the \r\nreport of the Council to the General Assembly for the \r\nperiod August 2006 to July 2007 (A/62/2). \r\n We note with interest the inclusion of a brief \r\nintroduction written by the delegation of China, which \r\nheld the Council presidency for the month of July \r\n2007. The introduction summarizes the work carried \r\nout, including the organization of the work of the \r\nCouncil. We are grateful for the effort to provide \r\nqualitative information, which enables the General \r\nAssembly to better evaluate the Council’s work. \r\n However, it is essential to draft a more \r\ncomprehensive report that goes beyond the compilation \r\nof lists and addresses substantive issues, such as the \r\ncriteria used by the Council in its decision-making. \r\nThat would help to increase the transparency of its \r\nwork and to enhance the assessment capacity of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as the central organ and authority of \r\nthe United Nations system. To that end, it would also \r\nbe helpful if the Council submitted special reports \r\nmore often. \r\n Clearly, the global reality presents challenges and \r\nopportunities for the Security Council. In that \r\nconnection, without prejudice to the Council’s ability \r\nto obtain information about topics of interest to it, we \r\nnote with concern its tendency to address matters \r\noutside the sphere of competence entrusted to it by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n5 07-59062 \r\n \r\n Year after year, upon receiving this report, we \r\nhave noted the constant increase in the amount of the \r\nCouncil’s work. That is yet another reason why, for the \r\nsake of greater efficiency, that organ should stop \r\naddressing matters that are within the purview of other \r\nbodies in the United Nations system. \r\n I should also like to highlight the progress \r\ndescribed in the report concerning the situation in \r\nHaiti. In that connection, we appreciate the Council’s \r\nefforts, particularly the one-year extension of the \r\nmandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \r\nHaiti. We are confident that the Mission will be able to \r\nconsolidate the constitutional and political process \r\ntaking place in that country. \r\n Reform of the Security Council complements the \r\nprocess of reforming the Organization and must \r\ncontinue to be a priority for the Assembly. In its \r\ncurrent configuration, the Council does not match \r\ncurrent realities in terms of either its representativity or \r\nits working methods. The status quo is not appropriate. \r\nWe need reform that transforms the Council into a \r\nmore democratic, representative, transparent and \r\naccountable organ. \r\n My delegation recognizes the significant progress \r\nmade within the Open-ended Working Group on \r\nSecurity Council Reform during the previous session \r\nof the General Assembly. We highlight the efforts and \r\nthe leadership of Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, former \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. Likewise, \r\nColombia thanks the facilitators for their efforts and \r\nfor the presentation of their reports, which should serve \r\nas a point of departure for the next phase in the \r\nconsideration of this matter. \r\n It is undeniable that momentum has been created \r\nby the Working Group’s efforts, particularly the \r\nidentification of alternative ways to expand the \r\nCouncil’s membership — including the transitional \r\napproach — that can serve as a basis for seeking the \r\nbroadest possible agreement. The report of the Working \r\nGroup, and in particular the reports of the facilitators, \r\nalso serve as a basis for carrying out the General \r\nAssembly’s decision to consider this issue at its sixty-\r\nsecond session with a view to achieving further results, \r\nincluding through intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n Despite the consensus reached, various issues \r\nremain unresolved as a result of the environment in \r\nwhich the Working Group’s report and the Assembly’s \r\ndecision were adopted. We need to restore confidence \r\nand to create positive conditions of transparency and \r\ngoodwill. Attaining those objectives will be possible \r\nonly if Security Council reform is considered in an \r\nopen and participative forum where all States can \r\nexpress their points of view. \r\n In that connection, my delegation reaffirms the \r\nrole of the Working Group as the principal and only \r\nforum for considering this issue. The establishment of \r\nforums that could infringe upon the mandate and scope \r\nof the Working Group would be harmful to the reform \r\nprocess. Any further alternatives regarding this issue \r\nmust be aimed at supporting the Working Group’s \r\nefforts and building on the progress made within in it. \r\n In that context, the Working Group must first set \r\nabout defining a format, parameters and elements for \r\npossible intergovernmental negotiations. This first \r\nstage must be conducted in a consensual manner and \r\nwithout the imposition of artificial deadlines. \r\nSubstantive aspects should not be considered until the \r\nframework, modalities and components of the \r\nnegotiations are clear. \r\n While we must not prejudge the outcome of the \r\nprocess, our goal must remain to create a more \r\ndemocratic and more representative Security Council \r\nin which current privileges are not perpetuated. My \r\ndelegation reaffirms its support for the transitional \r\napproach, with an increase in the number of non-\r\npermanent seats and the possibility of re-election, \r\nprovided it does not lead to a de facto permanent \r\nmembership through repeated re-election. \r\n Considering an increase in the Council’s \r\nmembership must not eclipse the priority of continuing \r\nto review and adjust its working methods in order to \r\nachieve a more democratic and transparent body with \r\ngreater accountability. As on previous occasions, my \r\ndelegation reaffirms the need to increase the \r\nparticipation of non-member States so that the \r\ndecisions taken within this body can better reflect \r\nnational and regional realities, on the basis of the \r\nparticularities of each situation. \r\n Moreover, my delegation believes that the \r\nSecurity Council’s accountability to the General \r\nAssembly is the only way to achieve genuine \r\ntransparency in the work of the Council and to \r\nstrengthen the role of the Assembly as the \r\nOrganization’s sole universal deliberative and decision-\r\nmaking body. \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 6 \r\n \r\n Colombia, as a country that is part of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus movement, reiterates its willingness to \r\ncontribute to an open and constructive process vis-à-vis \r\nthe development of this issue, and expresses its \r\nreadiness to consider proposals that could lead to the \r\nwidest possible agreement among the Members of the \r\nOrganization. We call on all other States to maintain an \r\nopen and flexible approach with regard to this process. \r\n Mr. Swe (Myanmar): May I express our deep \r\nappreciation to Ambassador Marty Natalegawa of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, this month’s President of the \r\nSecurity Council, for his introduction this morning of \r\nthe report (A/62/2) of the Council covering the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2006 to 31 July 2007. I would also like \r\nto express our sincere appreciation to Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-first session, for the leadership she provided \r\nto find a way forward in the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n The latest annual report of the Security Council \r\nto the General Assembly was adopted by the Council \r\non 25 October 2007, and published as an official \r\ndocument just last week. It would have been more \r\nhelpful had it been made available much earlier. My \r\ndelegation hopes that that situation will be remedied in \r\nthe coming years. \r\n Article 24, paragraph 1, of the Charter confers on \r\nthe Security Council the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In \r\ncarrying out its duties, the Council acts on behalf of the \r\nMember States. In that regard, we believe that the \r\nCouncil must be accountable to the General Assembly \r\nin a manner consistent with the Charter. \r\n The question of equitable representation on and \r\nan increase in the membership of the Security Council \r\nhas been on the agenda since 1979. Although there has \r\nbeen intensive debate on that important topic for many \r\nyears, there was little progress until early this year, \r\nwhen the President of the General Assembly — the \r\npredecessor to the current President — urged members \r\nto focus on five key issues. Following extensive \r\ndiscussions on the key issues, a report was submitted to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly in April 2007. \r\nWe are encouraged to note that consultations were \r\nsubsequently carried out with the membership on how \r\nto move the process forward, and that a report was \r\nsubsequently submitted in June 2007. During the \r\nconsultations, many members reiterated that the reform \r\nof the Security Council must be an integral part of the \r\nongoing reform process of the United Nations and that \r\nthe reform of the United Nations would be incomplete \r\nwithout a meaningful reform of the Council. \r\n Notwithstanding new ideas that have emerged \r\nfrom the consultations, including the considerable \r\ninterest in, and openness to, the intermediary approach, \r\nthere still remain significant differences of views \r\namong members on the reform of the Security Council. \r\nNevertheless, in a broad sense, all of us agree on the \r\nfact that no meaningful reform of the United Nations \r\nwill be achieved without the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil itself. \r\n We share the view that the United Nations must \r\nbe reformed to be in step with today’s global realities. \r\nHowever, the reform must not only reflect the increase \r\nin membership of the United Nations, but must also \r\ntake into consideration the need for representation on \r\nthe basis of equitable distribution, mutual benefit and \r\ncooperation. \r\n In order to transform the Security Council into a \r\nmore representative organ that is capable of addressing \r\ncontemporary political and economic realities, its \r\nmembership must be expanded in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories. As developing countries \r\nare underrepresented in the Council, any reform must \r\naddress that inequality. \r\n After more than a decade of intensive discussions \r\non this important matter, we are not yet much closer to \r\nour goal. In the meantime, there is much that can be \r\nimproved with regard to the Council, even as it is \r\npresently constituted. That only needs political will. \r\n First and foremost, Article 24, paragraph 2, of the \r\nCharter should be respected to ensure that the \r\nCouncil’s actions are in accordance with the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations. In that regard, we \r\nfully share the view expressed by the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement that the decision by the Security Council to \r\ninitiate formal or informal discussions on the situation \r\nof any Member State or any issue that does not \r\nconstitute a threat to international peace and security is \r\ncontrary to Article 24 of the Charter. \r\n The expansion of the membership of the Council \r\nwill make it a more representative forum. However, \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n7 07-59062 \r\n \r\nexpansion alone will not guarantee the effectiveness or \r\ntransparency of the Council. Security Council reform \r\nmust place special emphasis on substantive issues — as \r\nwell as on its agenda, working methods and decision-\r\nmaking process — to make the Council more \r\ntransparent and democratic. \r\n The Council agenda should reflect the needs and \r\ninterests of both developing and developed countries, \r\nensure openness, transparency and consistency and \r\nabide by the provisions of the Charter, including \r\nArticle 100, paragraph 2. Those are measures that can \r\nbe taken immediately while we await the eventual \r\nreform and enlargement of the Security Council. \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, heads of State and \r\nGovernment expressed support for the early reform of \r\nthe Security Council as part of the overall reform of the \r\nOrganization. Let us work constructively to reform the \r\nCouncil to make it more representative, effective and \r\ntransparent and to further enhance the legitimacy of its \r\ndecisions. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): I would like to start by \r\nthanking my colleague from Indonesia, the President of \r\nthe Security Council for the month of November, for \r\nintroducing to the General Assembly this morning the \r\nreport (A/62/2) of the Security Council for the period \r\n1 August 2006 to 31 July 2007. \r\n It is clear from the report that the serious issues \r\nbefore the Security Council are increasing, both in \r\nnumber and scope, and encompass all major regions as \r\nwell as many cross-cutting thematic issues. However, \r\nlet me limit my brief statement to the other agenda \r\nitem under consideration today, namely, the question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. \r\n Once again, this debate is being held early in this \r\nnew session of the General Assembly. In fact, we have \r\nbeen speaking about this issue for nearly a decade and \r\na half in the Open-ended Working Group on the \r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase \r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other \r\nMatters Related to the Security Council. The impasse \r\non this fundamentally important issue does not reflect \r\nwell on the United Nations. It is all the more \r\nlamentable, given the fact that no one disagrees with \r\nthe conclusion of the 2005 World Summit, which \r\nacknowledged that early reform of the Security \r\nCouncil was  \r\n“an essential element of our overall effort to \r\nreform the United Nations — in order to make it \r\nmore broadly representative, efficient and \r\ntransparent and thus to further enhance its \r\neffectiveness and the legitimacy and \r\nimplementation of its decisions”. (resolution \r\n60/1, para. 153) \r\n In an interview you gave to BBC Radio recently, \r\nMr. President, you stated, \r\n“Reforming makes sense only if you achieve by \r\nthat more transparency, more efficiency, and you \r\nreflect what is today’s world situation.” \r\nWe could not agree with you more, Mr. President. The \r\nstakes are high, and an equitable resolution on the \r\nreform questions of the Council could greatly add to \r\ncomprehensive security. Our goals of reform of the \r\nSecurity Council are therefore far too important to \r\nabandon. We must continue to seek solutions with open \r\nminds and renewed vigour. \r\n Throughout the years, Iceland has advocated a \r\nmore representative and thus a more legitimate Council \r\nthrough expansion in membership, mirroring the \r\nchanges that have taken place in the overall \r\nmembership of the United Nations. We have also \r\nadvocated more transparency and inclusiveness in the \r\nwork of the Security Council. On this basis, Iceland \r\nwas one of the sponsors in July 2005 of resolution \r\nA/59/L.64, better known as the Group of Four \r\nproposal, which, as we all know, never came to a vote. \r\nIn a nutshell, Iceland’s position has been the following: \r\nincrease in both the permanent and the two-year \r\nelected members of the Security Council, a Council \r\ntotalling about 25 countries, working methods reform \r\nbased on the suggestions in the Group of Four and/or \r\nthe so-called S-5 draft resolutions, as well as increased \r\nrepresentation of developing countries. Since the \r\ntabling of the Group of Four proposal, we have had \r\nin-depth discussions on various models and possible \r\ncompromises. \r\n The valuable work on these issues during the \r\nsixty-first session of the General Assembly, the \r\nextensive efforts of the “5 plus 2” Permanent \r\nRepresentatives and inputs from all sides did frankly not \r\nproduce much in the way of formal results other than \r\nthe decision to continue the consideration of the issues \r\nduring the present General Assembly session. However, \r\nwe have the feeling that everyone now realizes more \r\nfully the need to show increased flexibility. \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 8 \r\n \r\n Ideas have been put forward, not ideal ones \r\nperhaps, but maybe the best possible substantial \r\nsolutions at this time, as acknowledged by the five \r\nfacilitators. These ideas need to be developed further. \r\nWe are looking for new avenues and ways, which will \r\nhave to encompass the issues of enlargement and \r\nworking methods. \r\n In the latest report of the Open-ended Working \r\ngroup from last September, we all agreed to continue \r\nour work on Security Council reform, including \r\nthrough intergovernmental negotiations during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We welcome this call. \r\n If fundamental previous positions are to be \r\nchanged during the forthcoming negotiations and the \r\nidea of a defined period of transitional arrangements is \r\nto be adopted, an agreement has to be reached on a \r\nmandatory review after a specific number of years. If \r\nsuch compromises are to be negotiated, it must be done \r\nwithout prejudice to original positions. \r\n Regardless of how our negotiations develop in \r\nthe weeks and months ahead, they must be marked by a \r\ntransparency that gives all Member States equal \r\nopportunities to participate. Or, as Ambassador Heller \r\nof Mexico said this morning, we must have a spirit of \r\ncollaboration of all States. \r\n Finally, we would like to congratulate the newly \r\nelected non-permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil. Iceland, as a first-time candidate, hopes to \r\njoin them on the Council for their second year there. \r\n Mr. Choi Young-jin (Republic of Korea): Allow \r\nme to begin by thanking the President of the Security \r\nCouncil for this month, His Excellency Ambassador \r\nMarty Natalegawa of Indonesia, for introducing the \r\nannual report of the Security Council. I would also like \r\nto commend the efforts of the Secretariat in producing \r\nthis report. \r\n According to the report, African issues remained \r\nat the forefront of the Council’s agenda, presenting \r\nboth challenges and opportunities. Burundi, Sierra \r\nLeone and the Central African Republic all began the \r\ntransition from conflict towards stability. We welcome \r\nand encourage the efforts of these countries and their \r\npeoples to consolidate the peace and stability that is \r\nnecessary for nation-building. \r\n In many other parts of the continent, however, \r\ninstability continued, particularly in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Sudan. The humanitarian \r\ncrisis in the Darfur region of Sudan is still ongoing. The \r\ntimely and full deployment of the African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur is essential in \r\nmoving the political process towards a comprehensive \r\nagreement. We hope to see improvements in both Sudan \r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo over the \r\ncoming year. \r\n The security situation in Iraq is still unstable. We \r\nsupport the efforts of the international community, \r\nincluding the Security Council, to promote an inclusive \r\nand effective political process in Iraq, aimed at \r\npreserving the country’s sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity. The Republic of Korea remains committed to \r\nhelping Iraq implement the International Compact with \r\nIraq and has been maintaining its troop presence there \r\nsince 2003. \r\n Lebanon has continued to experience political \r\ncrisis and instability in recent months. We support the \r\ncontinuing efforts of the Lebanese Government and the \r\nSecurity Council to establish peace and stability in the \r\ncountry. Through our participation in the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon, the Republic of \r\nKorea is pleased to contribute to that endeavour. \r\n Elsewhere in Asia, we are deeply concerned \r\nabout the unstable security situation throughout \r\nAfghanistan. Re-establishing lasting security requires a \r\nmultidimensional strategy, coordinating military, \r\npolice, political, and economic and social activities. \r\nThe international community must continue to assist \r\nAfghanistan in its transition to peace and stability. \r\n Turning to non-proliferation, the nuclear issue in \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\nrightfully attracted the attention of the international \r\ncommunity. The recent inter-Korean summit and the \r\nprogress at the Six-Party Talks have created \r\nconsiderable momentum for the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula. We welcome the significant progress \r\nat the Six-Party Talks last month in Beijing, at which \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea agreed to \r\nthe disablement of its three main nuclear facilities by \r\nthe end of this year. We hope that the denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula will be achieved quickly and \r\neffectively, contributing to peace and security in the \r\nregion and beyond. \r\n We fully recognize the importance of reforming \r\nthe Security Council to make it more representative, \r\naccountable, transparent, efficient and democratic. We \r\nbelieve that these principles are widely shared among \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n9 07-59062 \r\n \r\nMember States and that they should be upheld in our \r\nefforts to reform the Council. Given the enormous \r\nimplications of Security Council reform for the future \r\nof the United Nations, my delegation has long held the \r\nview that any proposal on Security Council reform \r\nshould garner the general agreement of the \r\nmembership, well above the required majority in the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We believe strongly in this \r\nprinciple of general agreement, which should be \r\napplied at every stage of our negotiations. \r\n An integral part of reforming the Security \r\nCouncil is improving its working methods. We \r\nwelcome the initiatives that have so far been put \r\nforward to enhance the transparency, accountability \r\nand inclusiveness of the Council’s work and we are \r\npleased to see that the Council itself is considering \r\nseveral such initiatives. We support the steps taken so \r\nfar by the Council in this regard. Building on this \r\nprogress, we believe that further reform is needed to \r\nmake the Council more transparent, democratic and \r\nefficient. \r\n On the issue of its membership, we share the \r\nposition of the Uniting for Consensus (UFC) group that \r\nthe best way to reform the membership of the Council \r\nis through an increase in non-permanent, elected seats, \r\nnot through the addition of permanent members. The \r\nUFC proposal would make it possible for each region \r\nto devise its own arrangements to ensure that large, \r\nmedium and small States are all represented in an \r\nenlarged Security Council. \r\n Many delegations have pointed out that the \r\ncurrent composition of the Council is based on the \r\nworld of 1945, and thus fails to reflect the changes \r\nover the past 60 years. We agree. By exactly the same \r\nprinciple, we believe that we should not freeze into \r\nplace a new structure based on today’s realities. The \r\npace of global change has never been greater, and it \r\nseems reasonable to expect that in a few decades the \r\nworld might be different from today in ways no one \r\ncould have predicted. \r\n We believe that the addition of permanent \r\nmembers would not be in the best interests of the \r\nUnited Nations or its Member States. It would be \r\ncontrary to the values that we have developed over \r\ntime and seek to promote. It would undercut the \r\neffectiveness of the Council. It would heavily impair \r\nits accountability as well. There is no democracy where \r\na single election entitles the winner to remain in office \r\nin perpetuity. For those reasons, we are opposed to the \r\naddition of new permanent members to the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n The Republic of Korea believes that the \r\ndiscussion of Security Council reform during the sixty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly should build \r\nupon the progress made during the sixty-first session. \r\nGiven the stark differences of view on a number of \r\ncore issues, we believe that the intermediate approach \r\nproposed by the facilitators during the sixty-first \r\nsession is our best hope for progress. My delegation \r\nwould like to emphasize once again that the Open-\r\nended Working Group is the legitimate place to discuss \r\nSecurity Council reform, both because Member States \r\nagreed on its continuing role for the sixty-second \r\nsession and because it can accommodate the views and \r\nconcerns of the majority of the membership in a \r\nbroadly representative, transparent and democratic \r\nprocess of debate. \r\n My delegation strongly believes that we should \r\navoid creating an atmosphere of confrontation among \r\nMember States, which could seriously divide the \r\nUnited Nations and endanger the United Nations \r\nreform process as a whole. We should refrain from \r\npresenting unilateral proposals that force divisive and \r\npotentially damaging discussions among Member \r\nStates. In this regard, we cannot but note with concern \r\nthat a draft resolution had already been circulated prior \r\nto today’s discussion. \r\n The Republic of Korea remains ready to engage \r\nconstructively in further discussion, with a view to \r\nreaching general agreement on this critical issue. In \r\nthat regard, Mr. President, we would welcome an \r\ninitiative on your part to move the process forward, \r\nwhich we trust would be carried out in an impartial and \r\nall-inclusive manner. We hope that, in our collective \r\nwisdom, we can find a method consistent with our \r\nshared values by which to reform the Security Council \r\nso that it can better fulfil its mandate. \r\n Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Charter of the United Nations designates the \r\nSecurity Council as the principal organ with primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. Over the past year, the Council has \r\ncontinued to work actively in addressing regional hot-\r\nspot issues, maintaining regional stability, helping with \r\nthe post-conflict reconstruction of the countries \r\nconcerned and preventing the proliferation of weapons \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 10 \r\n \r\nof mass destruction. My delegation is encouraged that \r\nthe Council has achieved impressive results on all \r\nthose fronts. While fulfilling its responsibilities, the \r\nCouncil is also trying continuously to explore ways to \r\nimprove its working methods, enhance transparency \r\nand strengthen communication and interaction with \r\nother United Nations organs and all parties concerned. \r\nI am convinced that the Council will stay on that track. \r\n As President of the Council for the month of July \r\nin 2007, China drafted the introduction section of the \r\nannual report of the Security Council to the Assembly \r\n(A/62/2). Other members of the Council, based on their \r\nexperiences, put forward many proposals on that \r\nsection and finally reached consensus. We hope that the \r\nreport gives an accurate, comprehensive and balanced \r\naccount of the work of the Council. It is true that there \r\nis still much room for further improvement in the work \r\nof the Council. China is ready to continue to make \r\nefforts, together with others, in that regard so as to \r\nenable the Council to better fulfil its responsibilities \r\nunder the Charter. \r\n Since the 2005 World Summit, there has been a \r\nseries of positive results in overall reform of the United \r\nNations, thanks to the common efforts of all Member \r\nStates. As an important component of United Nations \r\nreform, reform of the Security Council has been the \r\nfocus of attention by all sides and remains a tough \r\nissue, involving complex difficulties of various kinds. \r\nIt is encouraging to note that, as expected by all sides, \r\ncertain new dynamics and positive developments \r\nemerged in the discussions on Council reform during \r\nthe last session of the Assembly. \r\n First of all, strong political consensus has \r\nemerged among all Member States that the Security \r\nCouncil needs to improve its working methods and \r\nincrease its representativity. If Council reform can \r\nachieve a “soft landing” and produce further positive \r\nachievements, it will open a window of opportunity to \r\nincrease cohesiveness among the Member States and \r\nenhance the effectiveness of the multilateral \r\nmachinery. \r\n Secondly, while adhering to their respective \r\npositions, the majority of Member States are adopting a \r\nmore pragmatic approach towards the Security Council \r\nreform process. As stated in the report of the five \r\nfacilitators appointed by the previous President of the \r\nAssembly (A/61/47, annex II), a significant number of \r\nMember States displayed flexibility, expressed \r\nwillingness to explore a viable compromise solution \r\nand held the view that any reform formula should \r\nenjoy the widest possible political acceptance by \r\nMember States. Compared with two years ago, all \r\nparties concerned are leaning more towards \r\nconstructive consultations and practical cooperation on \r\nthe question of Council reform. \r\n Thirdly, at its sixty-first session, the Assembly \r\ntook note by consensus of the report of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the \r\nSecurity Council (A/61/47), mandating the Group to \r\ncontinue its work during the sixty-second session of \r\nthe Assembly and agreeing to launch an \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process on Council \r\nreform. The report submitted by the five facilitators \r\nsummarized well the positions of all sides and the \r\npossibility for progress and put forward some valuable \r\nrecommendations, which broadened the horizon for \r\nfuture consultations. \r\n While the political will of Member States is \r\ncrucial to the progress achieved so far, we must not \r\nforget the important role played by Her Excellency \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, the President of the \r\nAssembly at its previous session. China appreciates the \r\napproach taken both by Ms. Al-Khalifa and by the \r\nfacilitators she appointed of always dealing with \r\nCouncil reform in a constructive way and engaging in \r\nextensive consultations with all sides to seek a \r\nconsensus that accommodates the concerns of all. That \r\nis an important practice in the discussion of Council \r\nreform, and we should continue to follow that \r\napproach. \r\n Reform of the Security Council involves the vital \r\ninterests of all Member States, and the aforementioned \r\nprogress was not easy to come by. It therefore makes it \r\nall the more important that we cherish the current \r\npositive momentum, maintain adequate flexibility and \r\ncontinue our constructive consultations, with a view to \r\nachieving general agreement on concrete formulas for \r\nCouncil reform. China is open to the launching of an \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process. In our view, \r\nagreeing to start the negotiations is the first step of the \r\nprocess, and we must define the basic framework and \r\ncontent of the negotiating process so that we all know \r\nwhat will be negotiated and how the negotiations will \r\nbe conducted. \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n11 07-59062 \r\n \r\n China believes that, as an open platform with the \r\nparticipation of all 192 Member States, the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group could and should play an important \r\nrole in the future negotiating process. That will ensure \r\nthat the negotiations are open and inclusive and that all \r\nMember States participate equally. Regarding the \r\nnegotiating process, we must first reach agreement on \r\nthe entire framework through full consultations among \r\nall sides, because an edifice can be built only on a firm \r\nfoundation. \r\n Simply stated, years of practice have attested to \r\nthe extreme sensitivity and complexity of the issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform. Real progress on this issue \r\nrequires all sides to adopt new thinking and new \r\ninitiatives, build upon the current positive interactions \r\nand reach the widest possible consensus through \r\npatient consultations. We call on all sides to take as a \r\npriority the maintenance of unity among Member \r\nStates, show genuine political good faith, take practical \r\nmeasures to meet their interlocutors half way and, at \r\nthe same time, avoid any unilateral action that might \r\ncomplicate the situation, all with a view to creating a \r\nfavourable political atmosphere for working out a \r\ngeneral agreement through negotiations. \r\n China has consistently supported the necessary \r\nand reasonable reform of the Security Council and is \r\nwilling to continue to explore, together with others, \r\nappropriate formulas and ways for reforming the \r\nCouncil. We also support the continued effort by the \r\nSecurity Council to improve its working methods, \r\nefficiency and decision-making procedures so as to \r\ngive greater expression to the views of the broader \r\nUnited Nations membership. \r\n I wish to reaffirm our position that reform of the \r\nSecurity Council must accommodate the interests and \r\nconcerns of all sides and put priority on increasing the \r\nrepresentation of developing countries, especially \r\nAfrican countries. Any formula on Security Council \r\nreform that does not address the concerns of Africa can \r\nhardly win endorsement of the entire United Nations \r\nmembership and will not have the backing of China. \r\nThat is one of China’s fundamental principles \r\nregarding Security Council reform. \r\n Ms. Bethel (Bahamas): Like previous speakers, I \r\nwould like to thank the Permanent Representative of \r\nIndonesia for his presentation of the report of the \r\nSecurity Council contained in document A/62/2. The \r\nCouncil’s reports have been the object of much \r\ncomment over the years, given their potential as a \r\nmajor point of interaction between these two principal \r\norgans of the Organization. That potential takes on \r\ngreat significance because, according to Article 24, \r\nparagraph 1, of the Charter, the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations confer on the Security Council primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, and agree that in carrying out its \r\nduties under this responsibility the Security Council \r\nacts on their behalf. \r\n In as much as the Council acts on behalf of all \r\nUnited Nations Member States in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, and while few would \r\nargue that the report is not comprehensive, many \r\ncountries, the Bahamas included, agree that it could \r\nand should be more substantive and analytical, \r\npresenting a reflective view and assessment of the \r\nCouncil’s activities. It is also in this vein that the \r\nBahamas supports the idea of an interactive exchange \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly when these reports are being considered by \r\nthe latter. \r\n The report before us today certainly illustrates the \r\nbreath of the actions undertaken by the Council on our \r\nbehalf, and the report reveals that there has been a \r\ncontinuous increase in the volume and scope of the \r\nCouncil’s activities. The greater number of these \r\nactivities was, in our view, rightfully geared towards \r\nbringing resolution to a number of conflict and post-\r\nconflict situations, particularly in Africa. We commend \r\nthe Council for its focus in this area, especially in the \r\nlight of the acknowledged nexus between peace, \r\nsecurity and development and of the need to ensure \r\nthat Africa makes significant strides towards the \r\nachievement of internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The Bahamas also welcomes the Council’s \r\nsustained focus on our sister Caribbean nation, Haiti, \r\nthrough the activities of the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), in an \r\neffort to resolve the complex challenges confronting \r\nthat country. Here, we note with satisfaction the \r\nCouncil’s adoption of its resolutions 1702 (2006) and \r\n1743 (2007) during the period covered by the report, \r\nextending the mandate of MINUSTAH on both \r\noccasions. Security Council resolution 1780 (2007), \r\nwhich was adopted just last month and which extends \r\nthe MINUSTAH mandate for a full year, is equally \r\nwelcome and appropriate. It is absolutely imperative \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 12 \r\n \r\nthat the international community continue to provide \r\nHaiti with the required assistance and support for its \r\nstabilization and reconstruction in the months and \r\nyears ahead. \r\n The Bahamas also takes a keen interest in the \r\nwork of the various counter-terrorism bodies of the \r\nCouncil, particularly their efforts to increase \r\ncoordination in their respective fields of work, as well \r\nas their provision of technical assistance to those States \r\nin need. The sometimes Herculean effort required to \r\nimplement critical counter-terrorism measures adopted \r\nby the Security Council, as well as to meet reporting \r\nobligations under various resolutions, continues to pose \r\na challenge to many States, particularly small States. \r\nThe Bahamas would encourage the Council to continue \r\nits efforts to coordinate much-needed assistance to \r\nStates in all aspects of their counter-terrorism \r\nobligations, in our collective fight against that scourge. \r\n In tandem with the report of the Security Council, \r\nwe are also, appropriately, considering the report of the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of \r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nRelated to the Security Council contained in document \r\nA/61/47. \r\n The Bahamas acknowledges the service and \r\nefforts of the Member States that are members of the \r\nSecurity Council. We believe it is vital that all Member \r\nStates with the capacity to serve on the Council be \r\ngiven an opportunity to do so and, therefore, we feel \r\nthat the expansion of the membership of the Council is \r\nappropriate and should be given careful and due \r\nconsideration. A Council that is truly representative of \r\nthe present world must more equitably reflect the \r\ncurrent membership of the Organization, allowing \r\ndeveloping countries, including small developing \r\nStates, to play a greater role in its activities. \r\n Expanding the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil is, however, only one dimension of the reform \r\nthat needs to take place in that body. The other, equally \r\nimportant, dimension is reform of the Council’s \r\nworking methods. Many Member States continue to \r\nplace great emphasis and importance on the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council as a means of making \r\nthe body more transparent, inclusive, accountable and \r\neffective. \r\n The Bahamas welcomes the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup’s call for continued consideration of these issues \r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly. We \r\nbelieve that intergovernmental negotiations on all \r\naspects of Security Council reform are the next \r\nimportant step in advancing this process. My \r\ndelegation looks forward to participating fully in that \r\nexercise. \r\n The adage which states that with great power \r\ncomes great responsibility applies most appropriately \r\nto the Security Council. We believe that primary \r\namong the Council’s responsibilities is that of engaging \r\nregularly and constructively in dialogue with those on \r\nwhose behalf it acts, in an atmosphere of mutual \r\nrespect and trust. My delegation sincerely hopes that \r\nthis debate and the ensuing relevant discussions will all \r\ncontribute to that end. \r\n Mr. Khalilzad (United States of America): At the \r\noutset, Mr. President, I would like to commend you on \r\nyour efforts to work with Member States to achieve \r\ncomprehensive and much-needed reform of the United \r\nNations. During the general debate held here in \r\nSeptember, heads of State or Government identified \r\nnumerous new challenges facing the United Nations in \r\nthe twenty-first century. Peace, security, conflict \r\nmitigation and reform in the broader Middle East, post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding in Africa, non-proliferation and \r\nthe fight against extremism and global terrorism are \r\njust a few of the issues that the United Nations will be \r\ncalled upon to address. The Security Council, as the \r\nprimary guarantor of international peace and security, \r\nmust be able to continue to deal successfully with these \r\nand other threats to global security. \r\n The United States recognizes that the world has \r\nchanged, requiring the United Nations, including the \r\nSecurity Council, to adapt. The changed world suggests \r\nthat the modernization of the Security Council and the \r\ngreater United Nations system is both appropriate and \r\ntimely. \r\n Regarding Security Council reform, we believe \r\nthat expansion of the Council must ensure that its \r\nability to respond with agility, credibility and efficacy \r\nto threats to international peace and security is \r\npreserved. Qualified candidates for permanent \r\nmembership must have demonstrated their ability to act \r\nas responsible stakeholders in responding to global \r\nchallenges to peace and security. They must also \r\nmaintain a strong commitment to democracy, human \r\nrights and non-proliferation and provide substantial \r\npeacekeeping or financial contributions to the United \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n13 07-59062 \r\n \r\nNations. Those requirements suggest only a modest \r\nexpansion of the Council.  \r\n As President Bush said in his address to the \r\nGeneral Assembly (see A/62/PV.4), the United States \r\ncontinues to support Japan’s candidacy for permanent \r\nmembership. Other nations should be considered as \r\nwell, although we have not made any decisions about \r\nwhich other countries might qualify. \r\n The United States does not have a specific \r\nproposal for Council expansion. Despite our openness \r\nto the prospect of expansion, we have noted that \r\npersistent differences among Member States’ positions \r\nhave prevented previous proposals from garnering \r\nwidespread support. We therefore look forward to \r\nreviewing new proposals to achieve a modest \r\nexpansion of the Council that are capable of achieving \r\nbroad-based support. \r\n The United States continues to believe that \r\ncomprehensive reform of the entire United Nations \r\nsystem is needed to increase its effectiveness and \r\ncredibility in addressing the new challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century. Expansion of the Security Council \r\nshould be part of a meaningful package of reforms in \r\nother priority areas. We support efforts by the \r\nSecretary-General and the President of the General \r\nAssembly to achieve our shared goal of attaining a \r\nbalanced and comprehensive reform of the United \r\nNations, and we believe that such efforts will serve to \r\nreinvigorate the Open-ended Working Group on the \r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase \r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other \r\nMatters Related to the Security Council.  \r\n I look forward to hearing the views of other \r\nMember States and hope that this discussion will take \r\nus one step closer to achieving our shared goal of \r\nUnited Nations reform: to make this Organization as \r\neffective as possible to deliver for the next 60 years, on \r\nthe goals for which it was created. \r\n In conclusion, let me express my gratitude to you, \r\nMr. President, for helping this body engage in a \r\nconstructive dialogue on this important issue. I would \r\nalso like to thank the President of the Security Council, \r\nAmbassador Natalegawa of Indonesia, for his remarks \r\nintroducing the annual report of the Council (A/62/2). \r\nThe report provides all Member States with a \r\ntransparent and comprehensive review of the intensive \r\nwork of the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): I would like to begin, \r\nMr. President, by thanking you for convening today’s \r\nplenary meeting. My delegation attaches great \r\nimportance to this joint debate on two items: the annual \r\nreport on the activities of the Security Council and \r\nreform of the Council. It provides a timely and useful \r\nopportunity to reflect on the way forward on the key \r\nissues involved here: structural reform of the Council \r\nand improvement of the Council’s working methods. \r\n At the opening of the sixty-second session’s \r\ngeneral debate (see A/62/PV.4), Sir, you identified \r\nSecurity Council reform as among the five priority \r\ntopics to be addressed during this session. Japan \r\nwelcomes your strong interest in this issue. We place \r\nhigh expectations on your role as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in advancing Council reform and \r\nachieving concrete results during this session. \r\n First, I would like to touch briefly upon this \r\nyear’s report of the Security Council (A/62/2). I thank \r\nAmbassador Natalegawa, the President of the Council \r\nfor this month, for his presentation of the report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The report describes the continuing \r\nactive work of the Council, which has primary \r\nresponsibility for international peace and security. It \r\nalso indicates how the Council has incorporated efforts \r\nto tackle new challenges in its work. In that context, \r\nsome criticism has been raised, stating that such efforts \r\nconstitute encroachment by the Council on the \r\nresponsibilities of the Assembly. As the concept of \r\nsecurity expands, however, Japan believes that positive \r\noutcomes will be attained as a whole when the \r\nAssembly and the Council work together in a \r\ncomplementary manner within their respective areas of \r\nresponsibility. \r\n Japan supports the effort to increase the \r\ntransparency of the work of the Council. We note that \r\nthis year the Council’s Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions, under \r\nthe able leadership of Ambassador Burian, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Slovakia, urged all \r\nrelevant actors to ensure the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the note by the \r\nPresident of the Council (S/2006/507), in the \r\npreparation of which my delegation actively \r\nparticipated, and that the Group continues to explore \r\nmeasures to further enhance the transparency of the \r\nwork of the Council. \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 14 \r\n \r\n It is an important development that the Working \r\nGroup held a discussion on how to improve the report \r\ndrafting process; this is evidence of the Council’s own \r\nefforts to improve transparency. Japan would like to \r\nexpress its sincere appreciation for the dedicated work \r\nof the mission of Slovakia and would like to urge all \r\nMembers, Council members and other relevant actors \r\nto redouble their efforts to implement fully the \r\nrecommendations contained in the Note by the \r\nPresident. \r\n Japan welcomes the fact that momentum towards \r\nthe realization of Security Council reform was gained \r\nduring the past session and carried over to this session. \r\nThe majority of the political leaders of Member States \r\nstressed the necessity of Security Council reform \r\nduring the general debate of the current session. We \r\ntherefore welcome today’s timely debate and hope that \r\nit will accelerate the move to the next phase of the \r\nprocess. \r\n At the end of the past session, the Assembly \r\ndecided that the question of Security Council reform \r\nshould be considered during the sixty-second session \r\nof the Assembly, so that further concrete results might \r\nbe achieved, including through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, building on the progress achieved so far, \r\nparticularly at the sixty-first session, as well as the \r\npositions of and proposals made by Member States. \r\n I have exchanged views with almost every \r\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations here \r\nin New York since recently assuming my post. I am \r\nencouraged that the view is very broadly shared that \r\nthe current composition of the Council should be \r\nreformed as soon as possible and that we should \r\nproduce concrete results on this matter during this \r\nsession. \r\n Security Council reform has been under \r\ndiscussion in the Open-ended Working Group for the \r\npast 14 years. Through those discussions, the position \r\nof each country has been made quite clear. We are \r\nconcerned that if we again defer reform and the current \r\ncomposition of the Council continues to remain \r\nunchanged, not only will the effectiveness and \r\nrepresentativeness of the Council be compromised in \r\nthe years to come, but its credibility will be \r\nincreasingly questioned. \r\n With that in mind, we should enter into the \r\nnegotiation process on Security Council reform as soon \r\nas possible. This issue is our common responsibility, as \r\nthe present representatives of Member States — our \r\nresponsibility to the generations to come. States \r\nMembers of the United Nations have agreed solemnly \r\nto accept and carry out the decisions of the Security \r\nCouncil in accordance with the Charter. Therefore, the \r\ncomposition of the Council must be reformed to reflect \r\nthe current world reality and to make the Council more \r\nrepresentative and more effective. As we reflect on the \r\nhistory of international relations, we must demonstrate \r\nto the world that we have the wisdom and indeed the \r\ncapacity to reform the Security Council through \r\ndiplomacy and negotiations.  \r\n The reform of the Security Council is not a matter \r\nfor just a few Member States. At issue is the \r\nenhancement of the functions of the principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations. Enhancing the functioning of the \r\nSecurity Council is integral to that crucial task. Without \r\nmeaningful reform of the Security Council, therefore, \r\nthe reform of the United Nations will be incomplete. \r\n In order to enhance the functioning of the \r\nSecurity Council, we must reform its composition to \r\nreflect today’s world and to address effectively the \r\nneeds of the twenty-first century. To achieve that goal, \r\nit is necessary that those countries that have major \r\nresponsibilities in implementing the decisions of the \r\nSecurity Council with regard to international peace and \r\nsecurity should occupy permanent seats in the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n We continue to stress that the Security Council \r\nmust be reformed through modifications that include \r\nan expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership, with the inclusion of both \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, so as to make the \r\nCouncil more representative, more efficient and more \r\ntransparent while enhancing its credibility. \r\n In September, a new Cabinet was formed in \r\nJapan. The position of the Japanese Government on the \r\nreform of the Security Council remains unchanged. As \r\nPrime Minister Yasuo Fukuda stated in his policy \r\nspeech in the Diet on 1 October, \r\n “In order to be able to make further contribution \r\nto the international community, Japan will pursue \r\nUnited Nations Security Council reform and \r\npermanent membership in the Security Council.” \r\n I would like to take the opportunity to express my \r\nsincere appreciation to the many delegations that have \r\nexpressed their support for Japan in that regard. \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n15 07-59062 \r\n \r\n Japan also continues to attach great importance to \r\nimproving the working methods of the Council, as an \r\nimportant pillar of Security Council reform. We look \r\nforward to further progress in that area. \r\n We reaffirm the necessity of achieving concrete \r\nresults on Security Council reform during the current \r\nsession. During the general debate in the plenary on  \r\n28 September, Foreign Minister Koumura of Japan \r\nurged Member States to take such action. It is now time \r\nfor us to move Security Council reform to the \r\nnegotiation phase. Japan will participate actively in \r\nintergovernmental negotiations and in a flexible \r\nmanner, with a view to achieving concrete results \r\nduring this session. \r\n We hope that you, Mr. President, will continue to \r\nprovide us with the necessary guidance on this vital \r\nquestion. We would like to request that you exercise \r\nyour leadership in initiating a negotiation process and \r\nthat you convene an appropriate forum for such \r\nnegotiations at the earliest possible date. \r\n Mr. Salgueiro (Portugal): I would like to start by \r\nthanking you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting \r\nand for providing us with an opportunity to assess the \r\nstate of play in the reform of the Security Council and \r\nto reflect on how the process should move forward, \r\nwhile we attempt to take advantage of the productive \r\nand substantive work done during the sixty-first session \r\nof the General Assembly. I would also like to express \r\nmy appreciation to the Permanent Representative of \r\nIndonesia for his introduction this morning of the \r\nannual report (A/62/2) of the Security Council.  \r\n Two years have already elapsed since the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, at which heads of State and \r\nGovernment declared that “We support early reform of \r\nthe Security Council — an essential element of our \r\noverall effort to reform the United Nations.” \r\n(resolution 60/1, para. 153) \r\n In the two years since then, we devoted most of \r\nour attention and energy to other aspects of United \r\nNations reform. As a result of our joint efforts, \r\nimportant results were achieved, showing that a \r\nconvergence of political will is attainable even on the \r\nmost complex issues. Some momentum on Security \r\nCouncil reform was regained during the sixty-first \r\nsession. We thank the former President of the General \r\nAssembly for her commitment to that objective and for \r\nputting in place a methodology of work that led to the \r\nelaboration of two far-sighted reports. \r\n We also wish to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend the work done by our competent and skillful \r\ncolleagues — namely, the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Liechtenstein, the \r\nNetherlands and Tunisia — and to congratulate them \r\nfor the quality of the reports they have prepared. \r\n While exploring new and innovative ideas based \r\non the two different concepts of transitional approaches \r\nand intermediary arrangements, the reports prepared \r\nduring the sixty-first session managed to move the \r\ndebate from the repetition of initial static positions to \r\nthe introduction of a new dynamic in the discussions. \r\nThat approach allowed us to discern some movement in \r\nthe area of Security Council reform. \r\n Many questions still remain unresolved in the \r\nvarious aspects addressed by the reports, notably with \r\nrespect to the review exercise, the categories of \r\nmembership, the question of regional representation, \r\nthe size of an enlarged Council and working methods. \r\nThe Portuguese position on those issues is on record. \r\nAt this stage, I would just like to highlight two very \r\nimportant ideas that emerged from the work done \r\nduring the sixty-first session that we find to be in tune \r\nwith our long-standing positions. \r\n The first is that the debates held during the \r\nprevious session and the reports I have mentioned \r\nstressed the need to duly consider the concerns of \r\nmedium-sized and small States. We were wary of some \r\nof the ideas flagged during the debates of the sixty-first \r\nsession that pointed to the notion that the interests of \r\nmedium-sized and small countries should be dealt with \r\nin the framework of working methods — assuming that \r\nagreement on Security Council expansion was first and \r\nforemost a matter of concern just for major and \r\nmedium Powers. Notwithstanding the apparent \r\nimportance of enhanced working methods that would \r\nensure better access to the work of the Security \r\nCouncil, we are of the view that the enlargement of the \r\nCouncil — which definitely needs to be pursued — \r\nmust contemplate the concerns of medium-sized and \r\nsmall States and take into consideration the impact of \r\nthe relative positions of those States in the \r\ninternational community. After all, we must not lose \r\nsight of the fact that, in accordance with Article 24 of \r\nthe Charter, the Security Council acts on behalf of all \r\nMember States. \r\n The other idea is contained in the conclusion \r\ncontained in the April report of the five facilitators, \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 16 \r\n \r\nnamely, that a definitive solution to the question of the \r\nveto might not be feasible at this stage and that \r\nMember States might wish therefore to address it in the \r\nframework of the review process. In fact, it is our \r\nbelief that the requirement for concurring votes, \r\nestablished in Article 27, paragraph 3, of the Charter, \r\nshould not be expanded beyond the current permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council. \r\n We now face the responsibility of making good \r\nuse of the work done during the sixty-first session to \r\nseize and build on the momentum achieved, so that \r\nfurther progress can be made in the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly. We need to find appropriate \r\nways to implement the provisions set out in paragraphs \r\n(d) and (e) of the draft decision contained in paragraph \r\n21 of the report (A/61/47) of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security \r\nCouncil. We rely on your guidance, Mr. President, and \r\nyour experience and wise advice in the process of \r\ndefining the best way to move forward. But we also \r\nknow that your authority and wisdom cannot replace \r\nthe political will of the membership and its ability to \r\nstrike compromises. \r\n As the June report of the two facilitators puts it,  \r\n  “While the continued leadership of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly will be \r\nessential, substantive input from Member States \r\nwill be indispensable in order to take the \r\ndiscussions to the next stage.” (A/61/47, annex IV, \r\npara. 26) \r\nAnd referring to the recommendation to start \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, the facilitators \r\nconcluded that “Member States should have primary \r\nownership of such a process”. (A/61/47, annex IV, \r\npara. 27). \r\n Portugal stands ready to engage in a process of \r\nnegotiations that is truly intergovernmental, open, \r\ntransparent and inclusive. This phrase may sound like \r\nmere jargon, but we believe that it is profoundly true, \r\nin particular on the subject of Security Council reform, \r\nin which every Member State has a stake. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Events of recent years show clearly that \r\nglobal problems of security — such as, settling acute \r\nregional conflicts, fighting international terrorism and \r\nfighting the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction — demand collective approaches. The best \r\nforum for working out such issues is, indeed, the \r\nUnited Nations, which has a unique legitimacy. So we \r\nsee our basic task to be the strengthening of the United \r\nNations as a universal mechanism to consider and \r\nsettle problems facing mankind. \r\n Of course, changes in the world today and the \r\nemergence of new challenges and threats require that \r\nthe United Nations and its main bodies adapt to the \r\nnew realities, and that includes the Security Council. \r\nFor example, it would be in the general interest to \r\nmake more active use of the peacemaking potential of \r\nthe United Nations. Qualitative improvement would \r\ninclude making the Military Staff Committee, a charter \r\nbody, under the Security Council, fully operational. \r\nThat organ could work in a new format, involving all \r\nmembers of the Security Council. \r\n Reform of the United Nations, including such an \r\nimportant element as enlarging the Security Council, is \r\nnot an end in itself. Any changes must be geared \r\ntowards enhancing the effectiveness of the United \r\nNations and strengthening its central role in \r\npeacekeeping. It is essential, in deciding on reform, \r\nthat we be guided by the need to preserve the inter-\r\nState nature of this world Organization. In order to \r\nachieve this goal, one has to have the broadest possible \r\nagreement of Member States on all changes that are \r\nbeing envisaged. \r\n Every year, all States Members of the United \r\nNations have an opportunity to gather together and \r\ndiscuss the results of the work of the Security Council, \r\nas reflected in its annual report, which was introduced \r\nto us today on behalf of the Council by its President, \r\nthe Ambassador of Indonesia, Mr. Marty Natalegawa. \r\nSuch an open and transparent debate is extremely \r\nimportant. \r\n The fact that, as in the past, the Council has been \r\nactively involved in settling the most important \r\ncontemporary problems shows that the international \r\ncommunity and the members of the Council themselves \r\nare showing the proper respect for the irreplaceable \r\nand unique principle of the legitimacy of Council \r\ndecisions. That underlies the entire process of the \r\nsettling of international peace and security issues. But \r\nat the same time, that means that the Council bears a \r\nheavy responsibility vis-à-vis the decisions it takes and \r\nensuring that those decisions are implemented. \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n17 07-59062 \r\n \r\n One important factor here is improving the \r\ninteraction between the Council and other bodies \r\nwithin the United Nations system, namely, the General \r\nAssembly, the Secretariat, new entities such as the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, and also regional and other \r\nintergovernmental organizations. Another factor would \r\nbe improving the working methods of the Council. We \r\nhave to make sure not only that we adopt resolutions \r\nand make declarations or statements, but also that we \r\ntake a strategic approach, trying to ensure \r\nimplementation of the decisions that we have taken, \r\nand that we continue improving the partnership and \r\ndialogue with countries that contribute troops to \r\npeacekeeping operations and with other players in \r\npeacekeeping. \r\n The range of views and approaches of Members \r\nto this question of increasing the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council is still is very broad. We support the \r\nidea that we continue in this session seeking a common \r\ndenominator through collective and transparent efforts, \r\ninter alia, through negotiations and showing the \r\nnecessary flexibility and patience. \r\n We fully support the view that reforming the \r\nCouncil should ensure the broadest possible support by \r\nMembers of the Organization. In any event, there \r\nshould be a larger majority than simply the legally \r\nrequired two-thirds majority of Members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Our common task is to lay a \r\nfoundation for further consolidation of the authority \r\nand potential of the Security Council as the principal \r\nbody for the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n We all carry a heavy responsibility to ensure that \r\npoorly thought out steps to reform the Council don’t \r\nlead to polarization and division among Member \r\nStates, thereby weakening instead of strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council, and also \r\nthereby complicating efforts on other reform tracks in \r\nthe Organization. \r\n Russia’s position of principle on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council is well known and includes a lot of \r\nroom for flexibility. We are ready to continue the \r\npainstaking work of bringing approaches closer \r\ntogether, so that we can choose the optimal model for \r\nfuture Council membership. We are ready to consider \r\nany reasonable option for increasing membership, \r\nincluding the so-called intermediary approach, if it gets \r\nbroad agreement within the United Nations. One key \r\nguideline is that the Council should be more \r\nrepresentative, but that should not be detrimental to its \r\nability to do its work in maintaining international peace \r\nand security. \r\n Accordingly, we support the idea that the Council \r\nshould not be too large. We believe that it would be \r\ncounterproductive to curtail the powers of the current \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, including \r\nthe veto as a whole. \r\n There is a continuing positive trend in the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council — including \r\nenhancing openness in the work of the Council and \r\nincreasing dialogue with non-members. A lot has been \r\ndone within current procedures to ensure that interested \r\nStates are able to report their views to members of the \r\nCouncil and to get fuller and more up-to-date \r\ninformation about the work of the Council. The facts \r\nand statistics cited by the President of the Council this \r\nmorning speak for themselves in this respect. \r\n Today, our common task is to focus on \r\nimplementing the changes that were agreed to in the \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions. Those changes are designed to \r\npromote greater transparency and openness in the work \r\nof the Council. The experience of reaching agreement \r\non those changes — and it was not always easy — \r\nclearly showed that only initiatives to improve working \r\nmethods of the Council that enjoy consensus support of \r\nits members can really help us to achieve progress in \r\nreforming this primary organ of the United Nations. \r\n Rational transparency in the work of the Security \r\nCouncil includes developing dialogue between the \r\nSanctions Committees and a broad range of States and \r\nregional and other organizations so as to improve the \r\nsanctions regime, and ensure strict compliance with \r\nembargoes imposed by the Security Council on arms \r\ndeliveries in conflict areas. We are ready to continue \r\nwith a constructive and transparent exchange of views, \r\ninter alia, within the Assembly’s open-ended working \r\ngroup of the whole on the whole range of issues \r\nrelating to expanding the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Permit me at the outset to thank the \r\nrepresentative of Indonesia, which holds the Security \r\nCouncil presidency this month, for presenting the report \r\nof the Council to the General Assembly (A/62/2). The \r\nreport indicates a significant increase in the volume and \r\nscope of the Council’s activities last year. \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 18 \r\n \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade on behalf of the African Union (AU) by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Angola, Chair of the AU \r\nfor November, and with the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Cuba on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. We also wish to congratulate \r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Burkina Faso, Viet Nam, \r\nCroatia and Costa Rica on their recent election as non-\r\npermanent members of the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2008-2009. \r\n The United Nations has changed since it was \r\nfounded on 24 October 1945, when 51 Member States \r\nsigned its Charter. Today, the Organization has more \r\nthan 190 Member States. In the light of that fact, \r\ncombined with the ever-increasing number of global \r\nand intertwined problems and interests caused by \r\nglobalization, the Organization must be restructured \r\nand modernized, especially with respect to the Security \r\nCouncil, which bears responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n Reform of the Security Council has seen no \r\nprogress for more than 14 years. In 1993, given the \r\nimportance of the matters addressed by the Council, \r\nwhich is the United Nations organ entrusted with \r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, the General Assembly \r\nadopted its resolution 48/26, establishing an Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the \r\nSecurity Council. Without the Security Council, the \r\nbackbone of the United Nations, and without peace and \r\nsecurity, there would be no economic or social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Mauritania firmly \r\nbelieves in the purposes and principles for which the \r\nUnited Nations was established. Therefore, we believe \r\nthat there must be more equitable representation within \r\nthe Security Council, given the right of the African \r\ncontinent to occupy a permanent Council seat. Indeed, \r\nAfrica is the only continent not to have a permanent \r\nseat on that important and sensitive body. Because the \r\nmajority of armed conflicts and disputes have taken \r\nplace on African soil, Africa cannot be excluded from \r\npermanent representation on the Council. We must \r\ncorrect this great injustice. Seventy per cent of the \r\nresolutions of the United Nations, including Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, deal primarily with the developing \r\nworld, particularly Africa. It is thus worthy to have \r\nAfrica participate in adopting such resolutions. This \r\ncan come about by granting Africa a permanent seat on \r\nthe Council alongside the current five permanent \r\nmembers. \r\n My country fully supports the Sirte Declaration \r\nand the Ezulwini Consensus, which set out the \r\nlegitimate and just claims of the African continent. \r\nSpecifically, the African continent is requesting two \r\npermanent seats with veto power and two \r\nnon-permanent seats. Thus, Africa would have two \r\npermanent and five non-permanent seats in total. In the \r\nlight of the Arab and African components of the \r\ncontinent’s social fabric, it should be up to the African \r\nUnion to decide which States should occupy those \r\nseats. \r\n It is high time for serious and substantive reform \r\nof United Nations bodies, particularly the Security \r\nCouncil, which must be expanded to lay the foundation \r\nfor true democracy within the United Nations system. \r\nWe hope that the Ezulwini Consensus, which clearly \r\nreflects the positions and interests of African countries, \r\nwill be respected as the foundation for any future \r\nconsultations and arrangements decided upon by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation also supports the \r\nlegitimate requests of Germany and Japan for \r\npermanent Council seats, given their important roles in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\ntheir considerable efforts to ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment in developing countries, and their \r\ncontributions to United Nations efforts in that regard.  \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): My \r\ncountry, Senegal, endorses the statement made by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ismael Abraão Gaspar Martins, \r\npermanent representative of Angola, on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States. In my national capacity, I \r\nshould like to make a few additional comments \r\nfollowing the presentation of the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/2) by the permanent \r\nrepresentative of Indonesia, whom we thank. \r\n The Senegalese delegation believes that, more \r\nthan a mere ritual at every session of the General \r\nAssembly, the submission of the Security Council’s \r\nreport to this principal body of the Organization should \r\nbe an opportunity for Member States to discuss in \r\ndepth the initiatives and actions taken on all our behalf \r\nby that important organ, which is entrusted with the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n19 07-59062 \r\n \r\n However, we must acknowledge that, in its \r\ncurrent form, the report of the Council does not give us \r\nenough information about the motivations and reasons \r\nbehind Council action or non-action. Therefore, it does \r\nnot give us information that is likely to lend itself to \r\nfruitful discussion. That is why we express once again \r\nour hope to receive more detailed and analytical \r\nreports from the Council. \r\n More than ever before, the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council is a timely issue that concerns a \r\nlarge majority of Member States. The reason is that \r\nreform of the Council has become necessary, owing to \r\ntwo requirements: modernization and justice. \r\n Modernization is required because today, no one \r\ndenies any longer that the world’s realities are totally \r\ndifferent from those that formed the basis for the \r\nCouncil’s structuring in 1945. Justice — as that word is \r\nbeing used here, equitable representation within the \r\nSecurity Council — refers to an obligation to ensure \r\njustice in the redistribution of roles and responsibilities \r\nwithin a reformed Council. Thus, Senegal believes that \r\nany effort to achieve equitable representation must \r\nbegin by correcting an injustice, namely, that Africa is \r\nthe only continent without a permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Senegal, which shares the Common African \r\nPosition, believes that an increase in the number of \r\nCouncil members in the two current categories, \r\npermanent and non-permanent, remains necessary. \r\nIndeed, the two challenges to which I have referred — \r\nadjusting the Council to new geopolitical realities and \r\nmaking it more equitable — require that we expand \r\nboth categories. However, we believe that, whatever \r\nthe number or formula chosen, the representation of \r\ndeveloping countries and small States must be \r\nincreased. \r\n With regard to the right of the veto — which is, \r\nquite rightly, the object of much criticism — we \r\nbelieve that the demands of modernization and justice \r\nin action require that we deal with it in a realistic and \r\nresponsible manner, bearing in mind that a single \r\ncountry cannot and must not block or paralyse Security \r\nCouncil action, often for interests that are different \r\nfrom those of the international community as a whole. \r\nIf we want the United Nations to maintain its \r\ncredibility and authority, we must ensure that the \r\naction or inaction of the Security Council is based on \r\njust motives that are in conformity with the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter. \r\n Her Excellency, Sheika Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, involved Member States in a dynamic process \r\nguided by seven facilitators, during which, many views \r\nand positions were expressed by States, groups of \r\nStates and interest groups. The report of the two last \r\nfacilitators appointed by Ms. Al-Khalifa (A/61/47, \r\nannex IV) proposes several possible paths that could \r\nserve as the basis for intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nThe concept of reform in stages, based on the \r\nintermediary approach which involves a review clause, \r\nseems interesting and could enable States to overcome \r\ncertain differences of opinion. This idea, however, does \r\nnot exclude the possibility of the proposed reform \r\nbeing sufficiently ambitious, thus responding to the \r\nviews widely expressed by Member States. \r\n The momentum from which the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform benefited during the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly deserves to be \r\nsustained and strengthened during the present session. \r\nWe count, Sir, on your diligence so that all Member \r\nStates commit themselves anew to deepening the \r\nprocess already under way. What is at stake is \r\ndefinitely worth it, if we want the Security Council, the \r\nprincipal organ entrusted with the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, to enjoy greater \r\nlegitimacy, credibility and authority. \r\n Mr. Matussek (Germany): Let me first thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for convening this important \r\nmeeting of the session of the General Assembly. I \r\nwould already like to express my sincere gratitude to \r\nyou for doing so because I am convinced that this \r\nmeeting will move the reform of the Security Council \r\nforward. You yourself stressed at the opening of the \r\nsixty-second session on 18 September (see A/62/PV.1) \r\nthat you would take the mandate of the sixty-first \r\nsession’s decision (see A/61/PV.109) seriously and \r\nbuild on the momentum created in the past few months. \r\nWe are ready to support you: to support you in your \r\nendeavour to start negotiations on concrete text \r\nproposals. And we will show flexibility. \r\n Many colleagues have already spoken today. \r\nWhen I try to summarize today’s discussion, I think \r\nthere is one common feeling: Security Council reform \r\nhas reached a critical stage. There is a shared sense of \r\nurgency: if we are not able to achieve reform during \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 20 \r\n \r\nthe sixty-second session, we will lose momentum and \r\nwe will lose public support in many countries, where it \r\nwill be said that the United Nations is unable to reform \r\nitself. The United Nations system as a whole will lose \r\ncredibility and, in particular, the most important body \r\nfor the maintenance of peace and security, the Security \r\nCouncil, will, in the eyes of many, lose legitimacy — \r\nat a time when the legitimacy and effectiveness of the \r\nSecurity Council are crucial if we are to resolve a \r\nnumber of vital issues. \r\n The conclusion I draw from today’s discussion is \r\nthat the overwhelming majority of members have a \r\nclear sense of our common responsibility. We have to \r\nbring about reform of the Security Council during the \r\nsixty-second session in order to make the Security \r\nCouncil more legitimate, more effective, more \r\nrepresentative, more accountable and more transparent. \r\nOur discussion during the sixty-first session showed \r\nthat there is enough common ground for a reform \r\nproject. We have a good chance of achieving the \r\nrequired two-thirds majority. \r\n What is the way forward? First, as to procedure: \r\nwe have to start negotiations as soon as possible, and \r\nthat means in the next few weeks. We need an \r\nappropriate mechanism to initiate intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Your guidance, Mr. President, and your \r\nleadership immediately following this debate are \r\nneeded in two ways. First of all, we need a format for \r\nnegotiations. We all know that this cannot be done in \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group. Intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations need a more efficient forum if we want to \r\nsee results soon. And we need a tool for negotiations. \r\nThis tool, a proposal for a consolidated text, should be \r\nelaborated on the basis of progress achieved so far. \r\nThis text will, at this stage, not be a draft resolution but \r\nrather a text outlining a result in a clearer way than the \r\nfacilitators’ reports during the sixty-first session. There \r\nshould also be a precise road map for the negotiations \r\nand a time frame within which to finish the \r\nnegotiations, with a result to be achieved during the \r\nsixty-second session. \r\n Secondly, on substance, we still believe that the \r\nGroup of Four proposal would be the best way \r\nforward. However, as we have mentioned, we are open-\r\nminded and we do not rule out a two-step or \r\nintermediary approach. However, the following \r\nconsiderations should be kept in mind. If an \r\nintermediary approach is to be considered, it must \r\nbring about real change. We cannot simply settle for \r\nthe lowest common denominator. We must create a \r\nformula for a Council that will reflect today’s political \r\nrealities and that will truly change the balance of \r\npower in the Council right from the start of the \r\nintermediary period. Otherwise political frustration in \r\nmany parts of the world will further increase over time, \r\nand we will thus have failed to meet the very objective \r\nof the reform. \r\n A mandatory review must be an integral part of \r\nthe solution. The option for a more comprehensive \r\nreform and a review of the first reform drive must not \r\nremain a vague promise. Any solution we envisage \r\nmust contain a mandatory review within a clear time \r\nframe and a clearly defined mandate. \r\n The decision will possibly have to be made by a \r\nvote, which, according to the United Nations Charter, \r\nwill have to be by a two-thirds majority. The aim is a \r\nmore legitimate Council. What we want is not just a \r\nlarger Council. What we want is a different Council, \r\none that will be more legitimate, more transparent, \r\nmore representative, more effective and more reflective \r\nof today’s political realities. It is not enough to add \r\nmore two-year seats or to take similar half-measures. \r\n We urge Members to join us in showing \r\nflexibility, thus paving the way for results-oriented \r\nnegotiations. It is high time for us to get down to work, \r\nstart negotiations and produce clear-cut results. \r\n Mr. Lacroix (France) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme first of all to thank you, Sir, on behalf of my \r\ndelegation and to thank also the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Indonesia, Ambassador Natalegawa, \r\nfor the report he presented to us on behalf of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/2). \r\n We would also thank you, Mr. President, for \r\nhaving us meet today to discuss this very basic issue, \r\nnamely, the reform of the Security Council. It is our \r\nhope that the debate will enable us to move ahead \r\ntogether towards defining the framework of \r\nnegotiations that should lead us to a bold reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. You have made this one of the \r\npriorities for your term of office, which you recently \r\nconfirmed in your letter of 8 November. I would assure \r\nyou of the French delegation’s full support. \r\n France’s commitment here has been and remains \r\nunswerving. As the President of the French Republic \r\nsaid in the General Assembly on 25 September, \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n21 07-59062 \r\n \r\n “in this world where the fate of each of us \r\ndepends on the fate of others, the United Nations \r\nshould not be weakened; the United Nations must \r\nbe strengthened. Reforming the United Nations \r\nso as to adapt it to the realities of our world is an \r\nabsolute priority for France. We cannot afford to \r\nwait any longer”. (A/62/PV.4, p. 2) \r\n It goes without saying that we must mobilize to \r\nstrengthen the central institution of the United \r\nNations — the Security Council — in the areas of \r\npeace and security. How can we move ahead after so \r\nmany years of discussion? First of all, we must \r\nremember that the necessary expansion of the Council \r\nmust be geared towards strengthening its authority and \r\nits effectiveness. That is why we favour increasing the \r\nmembership in both categories, with new permanent \r\nmembers Germany, Japan, India, Brazil, and fair \r\nrepresentation for Africa. \r\n And then we have to acknowledge the recent \r\nwork done by the General Assembly. The decision we \r\ntook on 17 September called for us to achieve concrete \r\nresults on the basis of progress made, particularly at \r\nthe Assembly’s sixty-first session. We believe that the \r\nreport of the Working Group is useful in that it offers a \r\nbalanced account of the current state of affairs, and we \r\nshould draw inspiration from that.  \r\n If we want to have the Security Council evolve in \r\na direction that is more reflective of the realities of the \r\nworld today, then we must all show flexibility and \r\ncreativity with respect to the modalities of the reform. \r\nFrance is ready for that. We are open to an intermediate \r\napproach that, without prejudging the final outcome, \r\nwould enable us to move forward. \r\n The time has come to start negotiating. How? \r\nHere again we are ready to examine any appropriate \r\nmodalities in a practical manner. We count on you,  \r\nMr. President, to set forth the next stage for our work, \r\nin close consultation with the States most concerned. \r\nThere is little time left because reform is more \r\nessential now than ever before, and we must therefore \r\nactively continue our efforts. \r\n In conclusion, may I simply confirm that France \r\nis ready to do this work in a spirit of openness and with \r\na firm determination to succeed. \r\n Mr. Tarragô (Brazil): Mr. President, thank you \r\nfor convening this timely debate. The reform of the \r\nSecurity Council relates to the foundations of this \r\nOrganization and, therefore, to the international order. \r\nIn the consideration of the reform of the Council, \r\nincluding the improvement of its working methods, the \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of our collective decisions \r\non matters pertaining to international peace and \r\nsecurity are at stake. \r\n As mentioned in the report of the Security \r\nCouncil now under consideration (A/62/2), and \r\nconsistent with past trends, the volume and scope of \r\nissues before that body increased in the period from \r\nAugust 2006 to July 2007. However, outdated \r\ninstitutional structures impair the capacity of the \r\nCouncil to face the challenges posed by such an \r\nexpanding and increasingly complex agenda. To \r\nsucceed, we need a Security Council that is more \r\nrepresentative of the membership and fully reflective \r\nof contemporary international realities. With greater \r\nrepresentation and political realism will come \r\nenhanced legitimacy and effectiveness. \r\n Those are the fundamental considerations at the \r\nheart of Brazil’s position on Security Council reform. \r\nLike the overwhelming majority of members of this \r\nAssembly, we favour the increase in the number of \r\nboth permanent and non-permanent seats, and a greater \r\nrepresentation of the developing countries, which are \r\nable to contribute to the reinforcement of peace and \r\nsecurity. We also support the improvement of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods. \r\n These are the ultimate goals that Brazil, with \r\nlike-minded countries, will pursue in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations mandated by decision \r\n61/561, adopted September. Brazil is ready to engage \r\nin negotiations with flexibility, in a spirit of \r\nunderstanding. I am confident that all delegations will \r\ndisplay the same attitude. \r\n We view the September decision as an invaluable \r\nopportunity to change a status quo that Member States \r\nhave proclaimed to be unacceptable, a historical \r\nopportunity we cannot miss. It follows 14 years of \r\nextensive discussions in the Open-ended Working Group, \r\nwhich has reached its limits in producing the required \r\nreform. We should move ahead and not continue \r\nendlessly with the same procedures. We need to establish \r\nsubstantive negotiating dynamics capable of delivering \r\nconcrete results that lead to a meaningful reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, in accordance with the Charter. \r\n This will only be possible if the appropriate \r\nsetting for the negotiation is put in place in a timely \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 22 \r\n \r\nmanner. The process should start without delay, \r\npreferably in this month of November, and proceed \r\nsteadily so that it can be successfully concluded in the \r\npresent session of the General Assembly. Time is of the \r\nessence. The longer we delay the reform, the wider the \r\ngap between the Council’s outdated structure and \r\ntoday’s political imperatives. Gradualism has been \r\ndraining our energies for 14 years and, as such, has \r\nonly served those who do not want a meaningful \r\nreform of the Security Council. \r\n We trust you, Sir, to lead us. We are persuaded \r\nthat, guided by the relevant provisions of the \r\nSeptember decision, you will organize the negotiating \r\nprocess so that it will allow all to participate in an \r\ninclusive, transparent and result-oriented mode. You \r\nwill certainly have in mind paragraph (d) of the \r\ndecision that I have just mentioned, wherein clear \r\ninstructions have been given regarding our future \r\nwork, which must be based on concrete elements. The \r\nGeneral Assembly has chosen to pursue the \r\nnegotiations, building on the progress achieved and the \r\npositions and proposals of Member States. Incidentally, \r\na number of proposals have been presented to the \r\nAssembly, and facilitators have contributed to this \r\nprocess after extensive consultations, which we must \r\nrecognize. \r\n One possible practical manner to move forward \r\ncould be to determine, in an objective and transparent \r\nway, the substantive elements of the Security Council \r\nreform that garner the broadest support in this \r\nAssembly. In any event, we believe that all delegations \r\nagree to have a Member-driven process. \r\n The day-to-day management of the negotiating \r\nprocess is also a matter that you, Mr. President, will \r\njudge how best to handle. My delegation, for one, \r\nwould be honoured to take part in negotiations held \r\nunder your direct guidance. However, we would \r\nunderstand if you prefer to appoint a coordinator or \r\nfacilitator to assist you. In any case, we will rely on \r\nyour sustained leadership and wisdom. \r\n As all Members agree, without Security Council \r\nreform as mandated by our leaders in the 2005 World \r\nSummit, the goal of United Nations reform will not be \r\nattained. It is our hope and expectation that the \r\nnegotiations will soon be initiated. Such negotiations \r\nshould do what our predecessors have tried but never \r\nrealized. An enlarged and enhanced Security Council \r\nwill strengthen the United Nations and invigorate \r\nmultilateralism. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation would like to pay tribute to your wise \r\nleadership, Mr. President, and to thank you for making \r\nSecurity Council reform a priority during this session. \r\n We also associate ourselves with the important \r\nstatement made by the representative of Angola on \r\nbehalf of the African group. \r\n We would like to reconfirm our firm and deep \r\nbelief in the importance of Security Council reform. \r\nReform should be at the forefront of the agenda for the \r\noverall reform of the United Nations, because \r\nreforming the Council is key to enabling the United \r\nNations to respond more consciously and effectively to \r\nthe serious challenges facing the world today and fully \r\ndischarge its responsibilities in support of \r\nmultilateralism and the principles of justice, law and \r\nequality in international relations. \r\n The question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council is \r\nan item that has been on the agenda of the Assembly \r\nsince 1979, and yet no real progress has been made. \r\nThat can be seen in the rather modest account of what \r\nhas been achieved to date, despite the importance of \r\nthe subject and the commitments made by the \r\nPresidents and heads of State at the 2005 World \r\nSummit for an early reform of the Security Council as \r\nan essential element in the overall reform of the United \r\nNations. We therefore do regret the slow pace of the \r\nprogress achieved thus far, and we hope that there will \r\nbe a renewal of the political will on the part of Member \r\nStates, so that we can adopt a coordinated, determined \r\napproach and settle this matter by consensus as soon as \r\npossible, in service to the common concerns and \r\ninterests of all. \r\n We have repeatedly and urgently called for an \r\nintegrated and comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil so that the Council can reflect realistically the \r\ngeopolitical developments of the world today and \r\nrespond to the legitimate aspirations of the people of \r\nthe third world, especially the developing countries and \r\nAfrica. We reiterate our firm and full support for the \r\nAfrican position as set forth in several African Summit \r\nmeetings. The Organization’s work is negatively \r\nimpacted by the current composition and working \r\nmethods of the Security Council, which infringes on \r\nthe mandates of other bodies, falls short of carrying out \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n23 07-59062 \r\n \r\nits principal mandate — the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security — and takes a \r\ndisturbingly selective approach in deciding which \r\nissues are included on its agenda. Thus the Council’s \r\nstructure and working methods must be reformed in \r\norder to re-establish the institutional balance among \r\nthe various organs of the United Nations. \r\n Credibility must be restored to the Council’s \r\nability to discharge its mandate in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security in accordance with the \r\nCharter. The need to truly reform the Council arises \r\nfrom certain tragic developments in various parts of the \r\nworld, particularly the Middle East. Here, the Security \r\nCouncil acts as a mere spectator, disregarding \r\ninternational law, conscience and legitimacy. We need \r\na new Council that is able to take up the various \r\nchallenges in accordance with the law and with \r\nimpartiality, transparency and credibility. That is sadly \r\nlacking in the Council today because of a lack of \r\ndemocracy and the presence of a threatening \r\natmosphere. Threats are made by a minority of its \r\nmembers, who manipulate the Council for their own \r\nnarrow purposes and selfish national interests. The \r\nCouncil has become part of the problems and not a \r\nsolution to them. \r\n We hope that Member States will successfully \r\naccomplish this historically necessary work and we \r\nreaffirm our full support for conducting a serious and \r\nresponsible dialogue that will lead to the desired \r\nreform under your wise leadership, Sir. Reform the \r\nSecurity Council now and make this session a turning \r\npoint so that our children will not repeat 20 years from \r\nnow what we have said today. \r\n Mr. Majoor (Netherlands): The report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/2), now before us, is a factual \r\naccount of the Council’s work during the period \r\n1 August 2006 to 31 July 2007. Two hundred and \r\ntwenty-four official meetings, 71 resolutions, 52 \r\npresidential statements and 47 press statements — the \r\nreport is full of such facts and figures on the Council’s \r\nefforts to fulfil its mandate of maintaining international \r\npeace and security. Impressive facts, indeed. \r\n But there is another fact that also demands our \r\nfull attention, not just today, but during this entire \r\nAssembly session. That is the fact that there is now a \r\nwindow of opportunity for Security Council reform. \r\nThe Council is arguably the signature organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. The report on its work over the past \r\nyear, as presented this morning by the President of the \r\nCouncil, is a clear testament to that. The Council \r\nChamber is the one room where cameras from all over \r\nthe world regularly roll, the one room where \r\nresolutions might bring about the resolution of the \r\nconflicts besieging our post-cold war world, and the \r\none room where international order can be forcefully \r\nreshaped or restored through joint international action. \r\n Right before us lies an opportunity to further \r\nenhance the Council’s contribution to international \r\norder and to forge a more representative, transparent \r\nand effective United Nations and a Security Council \r\nbetter equipped to deal with the insecurities of the \r\ntwenty-first century. Reforming this centrepiece of the \r\nUnited Nations must necessarily be a centrepiece of \r\nUnited Nations reform. \r\n The need for Security Council reform has long \r\nbeen evident to all partners in this Hall, but it has \r\nnevertheless been part of a long and seemingly never-\r\nending debate — I say “seemingly” because last year \r\nwe finally and fortunately pushed the envelope and \r\nforged ahead towards real negotiations. That \r\nmomentum was generated in large part by the \r\ntransitional approach spearheaded during that session. \r\nIt is an approach that offers quite a lot of potential to \r\ndo something quite unusual, historically speaking, in \r\nthe reform debate: unite us rather than divide us. For \r\neach and every one of us, it offers the opportunity to \r\nhave our cake and eat it too. We can all have \r\nmeaningful progress on Council reform, but at the \r\nsame time we can all keep our original aspirations on \r\nthe specifics of it. If the Council is to be reformed at \r\nsome point in the near future, then an intermediary \r\napproach is, I believe, the way forward, and this \r\nsession of the Assembly is the first and probably the \r\nonly opportunity to do so. So, progress through \r\nintergovernmental negotiations is now in the air. After \r\nyears of wandering around, we finally got to that \r\nbridge — and now we must cross it. \r\n At this point, leadership to guide the membership \r\ntowards the destination of reform is as crucial as it ever \r\nwas. To be more precise, we need to establish a \r\nmechanism that will translate the current momentum \r\ninto the early start of results-oriented intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, building on the progress achieved thus far, \r\nparticularly at the sixty-first session. The Netherlands \r\nhas always been a staunch supporter of Security \r\nCouncil reform and will continue to be so, especially at \r\nthis hour of opportunity. \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 24 \r\n \r\n At outset of this debate, Mr. President, you \r\nshowed your resolve and your determination to make \r\nthe most of this opportunity. You have indicated where \r\nyou stand, and we stand with you. \r\n Mr. Akram (Pakistan): I would like to thank \r\nAmbassador Marty Natalegawa of Indonesia, President \r\nof the Security Council, for presenting the Council’s \r\nannual report (A/62/2) to the General Assembly. \r\n This joint debate is an important opportunity for \r\nthe membership to undertake a strategic review of the \r\nwork of the Security Council and of our collective \r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the \r\nCouncil. The Council acts on behalf of the entire \r\nmembership as the primary organ responsible for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The \r\nGeneral Assembly must assess whether the Council \r\nwas effective in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity: did it reflect the views and interests of all \r\nMember States? Did it act in accordance with the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter? \r\n Paradoxically, while some believe that the \r\nSecurity Council is the only United Nations organ that \r\nperforms, there is also widespread dissatisfaction about \r\nits work and decisions. Transparency and openness \r\ncould help to ease some of that dissatisfaction. \r\nUnfortunately, the Security Council’s annual report, \r\nwhile providing a good statistical record, fails to offer \r\nsufficient information or analysis, particularly with \r\nregard to its decision-making process. Decisions are \r\nevolved mostly in closed-door sessions, if not behind \r\nthe scenes by a few key States. The Council has not \r\nresponded to the call for special reports on important \r\nissues. Nor is there a consistent effort to maintain \r\ninstitutional interaction with the General Assembly or \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, for example, through \r\nregular briefings by the Security Council presidency to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly. \r\n The Security Council has been most effective, in \r\nrecent years, in addressing internal crises and conflicts, \r\nmostly in Africa, and considerably less effective in \r\nresolving threats to and breaches of international peace \r\nand security, which is its primary mandate. \r\n Peacekeeping has been utilized to good effect in \r\nseveral complex crises, from Sierra Leone to Liberia, \r\nBurundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti \r\nand Timor-Leste. Still, other situations, most notably \r\nSomalia, have been grossly neglected for years. \r\nHowever, much more needs to be done to prevent \r\nconflicts from erupting in the first place and to prevent \r\nrelapse once a situation has been stabilized. In that \r\nregard, it is important to address the underlying causes \r\nof conflict and pursue more proactively a \r\ncomprehensive approach focusing on post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding and development. The Council’s actions \r\nmust be conducted with full respect for the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of the States concerned. \r\n As regards inter-State conflicts, the Security \r\nCouncil’s record has been most unimpressive. Major \r\nunresolved issues, including in our own region, remain \r\nasleep on the agenda of the Council. Even in the case \r\nof some important issues on the active agenda, \r\nparticularly the Middle East, the Council’s role has \r\nbeen sidelined. It does not deal directly with some of \r\nthe other major conflicts and threats to international \r\npeace and security.  \r\n We have witnessed inaction and delay even in the \r\nface of the most obvious acts of aggression and \r\nbreaches of peace. We have witnessed double standards \r\nand selectivity; threats and the use of force and other \r\nforms of coercion; non-implementation of certain \r\nCouncil resolutions; and non-transparent, non-\r\ninclusive, partial and partisan decisions by the Council. \r\nThat is where we have the starkest realization of the \r\ninfluence and control of some permanent members and \r\nother major Powers, which, in small and secretive \r\nconclaves, make decisions that primarily reflect their \r\ninterests and that are often inconsistent with the \r\npriorities and aspirations of the vast majority of United \r\nNations Member States. It is therefore not surprising \r\nthat, despite the revival of a greater number of public \r\nmeetings of the Council, there has been little tangible \r\nimprovement in transparency and understanding of the \r\ndecision-making process of the Council. \r\n Those are the issues around which revolves the \r\nother aspect of our debate today, that is, the reform of \r\nthe Security Council. The stated objectives of reform \r\nare to make the Council more representative, \r\ntransparent, accountable and effective, thus enhancing \r\nits legitimacy and credibility. The central and crucial \r\nquestion is whether we can achieve those objectives by \r\nenlarging the coterie of the powerful few, or by \r\nstrengthening democratic representation, role and \r\ninfluence of the general membership of the United \r\nNations in the Security Council. We believe the latter is \r\nthe right and only feasible approach. \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n25 07-59062 \r\n \r\n That belief is the basis for our principled \r\nopposition to any increase in the number of permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council. Indeed, most of the \r\ndissatisfaction with the Council can be attributed to the \r\nexistence and role of the permanent members. We are \r\ntherefore totally unconvinced by the argument that this \r\ndissatisfaction, and the consequent erosion in the \r\nCouncil’s credibility, will be resolved by adding more \r\npermanent members. On the contrary, the problems \r\nwill be compounded by increasing the number of \r\npermanent members, each one of which will seek to \r\nensure the protection of its own national interests in the \r\nwork of the Council. Indeed, that would lead to a \r\ncomplete paralysis in the performance of the Council. \r\n Permanent membership for a few individual \r\nStates will deny the opportunity for equitable \r\nrepresentation to the rest of us. Only an acceptable \r\nformula with an increase in non-permanent members \r\nand rotation can provide the means for such equitable \r\nrepresentation for all States. Such rotation, combined \r\nwith regional representation, may also offer \r\npossibilities for a fuller representation of countries \r\nmembers of various groups of States. That could better \r\nreflect the complex current realities. Those realities \r\nconsist of a few large Powers; a number of medium-\r\nsized States; a majority of smaller States; and the \r\nemergence of regional organizations, which are playing \r\nimportant roles in international and regional peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n The position of the Uniting for Consensus group \r\nis flexible and realistic. It allows variable arrangements \r\nand different possibilities and options, including \r\nrotation and longer-term presence, through re-election, \r\nand providing a greater relevance to regional \r\nrepresentation. Such arrangements can also \r\naccommodate the interests of sub-regions such as the \r\nArab Group, the Caribbean Community and Central \r\nAmerica, and political groups, such as the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference, which has legitimate \r\npolitical and regional interests to promote and defend \r\nin the Council. The Islamic Conference of Foreign \r\nMinisters, held in Islamabad a few months ago, \r\nreiterated the demand for adequate representation of \r\nthe Islamic umma in any category of expansion in the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Since, under any proposed scheme for Council \r\nexpansion, new seats will be allocated to the regions, \r\nthe countries of those regions should be able to \r\ndetermine the nature of representation of those seats. It \r\nis not for one or more major Powers to determine such \r\nrepresentation. Furthermore, equitable geographical \r\ndistribution, envisaged in Article 23 of the Charter, \r\nwould make little sense if a seat allocated to a region \r\nwere to be occupied permanently by one country.  \r\n That is why we respect and understand Africa’s \r\nposition. Africa’s demand for permanent seats is for the \r\nentire region and is therefore different from other \r\nproposals that seek permanent membership for \r\nindividual States. As we understand it, against the two \r\nempowered seats that are sought by Africa, \r\nrepresentation on the Council could be from two or, \r\nthrough rotation, a larger number of African States, \r\nunder arrangements to be made by Africa itself. Africa \r\nwould thus retain the power to ensure accountability on \r\nthe part of those States that would represent it and act \r\non its behalf in the Council. The African model of \r\nregional representation, if it is applied to all regions, \r\nappears to be an approach that may help to evolve \r\nagreement on Council reform. Using the African \r\nmodel, other regions could also be enabled to decide \r\ntheir own arrangements for representation of their \r\nrespective regions on the Council. \r\n We are all aware of the history of this reform \r\ndebate. The positions of Member States and major \r\ninterested groups on various aspects of Security \r\nCouncil reform are well known. All support the \r\nobjective of a comprehensive reform. Our leaders \r\ncommitted themselves to that objective at the \r\nMillennium Summit and at the 2005 World Summit. \r\nHowever, major differences have persisted on the \r\nnature and the modalities of achieving reform. \r\n After years of impasse, there was a positive \r\nmovement last year. The Uniting for Consensus \r\nmembers took the lead, launching the call for a \r\nnegotiated solution, at a high-level open meeting in \r\nNew York co-hosted by the President of Pakistan and \r\nthe Prime Minister of Italy on 20 September 2006. The \r\nsubsequent process, led by Assembly President Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, assisted by several facilitators, led \r\nto presentation of two reports based on wide \r\nconsultations with the entire membership (see \r\nA/61/47). I would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nMs. Al-Khalifa and her facilitators for their important \r\nand sincere contribution. \r\n The facilitators’ reports concluded that: first, \r\nnone of the past proposals had the required support; \r\nsecondly, in order to be implementable, any reform \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 26 \r\n \r\nformula must garner the widest possible political \r\nacceptance of the membership, in any case well above \r\nthe required two-thirds majority; and thirdly, a \r\ncompromise intermediate approach was the only \r\nfeasible option. The reports were generally welcomed \r\nand appreciated as constituting significant progress on \r\nthe reform issue. The Secretary-General, in his report \r\non the work of the Organization (A/62/1), also noted \r\nthe main recommendation of the facilitators that \r\nMember States consider an intermediary approach as a \r\ncompromise solution with a view to unblocking the \r\nprocess. \r\n To achieve further progress, we must build upon \r\nthe progress achieved so far, particularly in the sixty-\r\nfirst session, as reflected in the reports of the \r\nfacilitators. That was decided by the Assembly on the \r\nrecommendation of the Open-ended Working Group on \r\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and \r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council \r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council. It \r\nwas also decided that the Working Group should \r\ncontinue efforts during the sixty-second session aimed \r\nat achieving general agreement among Member States \r\nin the consideration of all issues relevant to Security \r\nCouncil reform. Those are the parameters of the \r\nframework for the next steps in this reform process. \r\n The difficulties faced in adopting the report of the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group (A/61/47) last year \r\nillustrated how divisive this issue can become. The \r\npositive dynamic and the progress achieved through \r\nthe facilitators’ process were almost derailed by the \r\nunilateral draft resolution submitted by some States. \r\nThat move gathered weak support, and the report was \r\neventually adopted by consensus. However, that \r\nunilateral and partisan move eroded confidence and \r\ntrust in the process. We will need to rebuild that \r\nconfidence and mutual trust. We are therefore disturbed \r\nthat professions of flexibility heard here are \r\naccompanied by the reiteration of demands that are \r\nclearly unacceptable and by assertions that the \r\ndecisions on this issue will be taken by a vote. \r\n Uniting for Consensus believes that the reform \r\nissue can only be advanced through an approach based \r\non consensus-building and garnering the widest \r\npossible support of the Member States, with regard to \r\nboth substance and process. We support negotiations. \r\nIndeed, the Uniting for Consensus group was the first \r\nto call for negotiations. However, negotiations are \r\nmeant to lead to agreement, not to a vote. \r\n To ensure a successful outcome, negotiations \r\nmust be carefully planned and prepared. In the first \r\nplace, there must be clarity and agreement on the basis, \r\nparameters, framework and conditions for negotiations. \r\nThat should include confidence-building measures to \r\nprevent unilateral moves and pre-emptive initiatives \r\nthat could disrupt the process. Based on the \r\nrecommendations agreed at the last session of the \r\nAssembly, the following four elements should serve as \r\nthe parameters for intergovernmental negotiations \r\nenvisaged by the General Assembly. \r\n First, the discussions and negotiations should \r\ntake place within the framework of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group. That is the established mechanism. We \r\ndo not favour — and indeed, we will oppose — \r\nrestricted conclaves from which the vast majority of \r\nMember States would be excluded. \r\n Secondly, the aim should be to build on the \r\nprogress achieved at the sixty-first session, that is, the \r\ntwo reports of the facilitators, which recommend \r\nexploration of an intermediary approach. Submission \r\nof unilateral proposals will not advance — indeed \r\ncould retard — the process. \r\n Thirdly, the objective must be to achieve general \r\nagreement, as decided by the Assembly, that is, to \r\nreach a compromise, as recommended by the Open-\r\nended Working Group and endorsed by the Assembly. \r\nAny process which envisages a vote will be contrary to \r\nthe objective of reaching general agreement. \r\n Fourthly, there must be commitment against any \r\nunilateral or pre-emptive move, such as the submission \r\nof draft resolutions or proposals and calls for a vote by \r\nany side while the process is under way, at least for the \r\nduration of the sixty-second session of the Assembly. \r\n We believe that you, Sir, as President of the \r\nAssembly, should hold informal consultations to \r\ndetermine the conditions and framework for \r\nnegotiations. As has been the practice in the past, you \r\ncould appoint one or more vice-chairs of the Open-\r\nended Working Group to assist you in the process. But \r\nwe would urge you to strongly discourage the culture \r\nof putting forward draft resolutions and of threats of \r\nvoting as a means of achieving what needs to be \r\ndiscussed and agreed in negotiations. There can be no \r\ndiscussions and negotiations in an environment of \r\nthreat, coercion and pressure. \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n27 07-59062 \r\n \r\n Uniting for Consensus is keen to build on the \r\nprogress so painstakingly achieved during the previous \r\nsession. Artificial deadlines, however, will surely \r\ndivide us once again. We are confident that under your \r\nguidance, Sir, we will be able to carry forward our \r\nwork in an atmosphere of trust and mutual confidence \r\nto achieve a compromise negotiated solution through \r\nthe broadest possible agreement of Member States. We \r\nare ready and willing to work with you for the \r\nachievement of that objective. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): Canada welcomes this \r\nopportunity to share views on the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/2) and to return to the \r\nimportant subject of Security Council reform.  \r\n The report of the Security Council makes plain \r\nthat the complexity, variety and volume of Council \r\nbusiness continues to expand at a dramatic pace. With \r\nmore than 90,000 military, police and civilians \r\ndeployed in peace support missions worldwide, the \r\nUnited Nations is making a vital contribution to the \r\nreduction of armed conflict and the promotion of \r\nsustainable peace and development around the world, \r\nnot least through the oversight of elections and support \r\nfor the peaceful consolidation of civilian governmental \r\nauthority in States as varied as Liberia, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Haiti and Afghanistan. \r\n Working in cooperation with regional \r\norganizations, the United Nations has made great \r\nstrides in making peace operations a more effective \r\ninternational tool for saving lives, assisting democratic \r\ntransformation and creating a conducive environment \r\nfor economic recovery. We are deeply indebted to the \r\nCouncil, the Secretariat and above all the peacekeepers \r\nand all those who serve the United Nations in the field \r\nfor their tireless efforts. \r\n However, despite the progress made so far, the \r\nCouncil’s report leaves no room for doubt that, for far \r\ntoo many people in this world, the dream of a life of \r\npeace remains unfulfilled. \r\n The importance of the decisions of the Security \r\nCouncil to the daily lives of millions of people around \r\nthe world underscores the genuine urgency of \r\nreforming the Council to ensure it is more \r\nrepresentative, more effective, more transparent and \r\nmore accountable. Comprehensive Security Council \r\nreform remains a critical unfinished piece of business \r\nwithin our larger United Nations reform efforts and \r\nmerits renewed consideration during this session of the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Canada believes that the Council’s legitimacy \r\nwould be enhanced by increasing its membership to \r\ninclude a broader representation of the world’s regions. \r\nMy delegation understands the wish of some Member \r\nStates to have regular access to Security Council \r\nmembership, and for this reason we are open to the \r\nconsideration of elected renewable terms in the context \r\nof negotiations on enlargement. \r\n However, we take the view that those \r\nnegotiations must also result in significant \r\nparticipation of middle Powers and smaller States, \r\nwhich have an equal — if not greater — stake in the \r\nsuccess of the multilateral security system, and whose \r\ncontributions should not be taken for granted. \r\n While Canada supports the objective of Security \r\nCouncil expansion, it must be secured in a manner \r\nconsistent with the fundamental principles of fairness, \r\ndemocracy, accountability and flexibility. Otherwise it \r\nwill not enhance, but rather diminish, the authority of \r\nthe Council. For those reasons, it is important that \r\nagreement on Security Council expansion be achieved \r\nthrough negotiations. Any changes made have the clear \r\nsupport of a very broad consensus based on a wide \r\ncross-section of Member States. Putting such a \r\nfundamental issue to a vote would only prove highly \r\ndivisive. \r\n Canada continues to believe that it is not in the \r\nbest interests of the institution itself to add new \r\npermanent members to the Council. That is based on \r\nthe view that the discipline of regular elections is the \r\nessential mechanism for ensuring Council \r\naccountability before the Assembly and on the \r\nconviction that there are ways of making the Council \r\nmore representative, such as expanding the \r\nnon-permanent category of membership, without \r\nconferring special rights, in perpetuity, on a privileged \r\nfew. \r\n While the question of Security Council \r\ncomposition has dominated the debate on Council \r\nreform in recent years, it is clear that the legitimacy of \r\nthe Council depends not only, or even primarily, on its \r\ncomposition but rather on its effectiveness. In other \r\nwords, it is not just about who takes the decisions but, \r\nmost important, about the quality and timeliness of \r\nthose decisions. \r\nA/62/PV.48  \r\n \r\n07-59062 28 \r\n \r\n For that reason, Canada believes that Council \r\neffectiveness should be at the centre of the debate. We \r\nsee two key areas where the need for change is \r\nparticularly urgent and where the potential for progress \r\nis well within our collective grasp. First, the Security \r\nCouncil’s working methods should be improved to \r\nincrease accountability, inclusivity and transparency, to \r\npromote evidence-based decision-making and to limit \r\nthe use of the veto. Secondly, the Security Council’s \r\nnormative framework should be updated, so that it is \r\nbetter equipped to meet the demands of the changing \r\nsecurity environment of the twenty-first century. \r\n Thanks to organizations such as Security Council \r\nReport and the dedication of a number of Council \r\nmembers, particularly the elected members — I recall, \r\nin particular, Japan’s work while recently on the \r\nCouncil — the Council is a more transparent body \r\ntoday than at any other point in its history. But at a \r\ntime when the Council’s work has increasingly far-\r\nreaching implications for all Member States in areas \r\nsuch as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation, \r\nCanada believes more could, and should, be done. \r\n First, we urge the Council to redouble its efforts \r\nto enhance consultation with the broader membership, \r\nfor example by making more frequent and systematic \r\nuse of informal exchanges and by increasing the \r\nregularity of substantive briefings for Member States, \r\nincluding on the work of subsidiary bodies. \r\n Secondly, we encourage the Council to expand \r\nand deepen the practice of public and open debates, \r\nwhich allow the broad membership to contribute their \r\nperspectives and ideas to the Council’s consideration of \r\nthe international peace and security agenda. \r\n Thirdly, where States have capacity challenges in \r\nmeeting Council obligations, such as in counter-\r\nterrorism, we would encourage the Council to identify \r\nopportunities for, and facilitate the furnishing of, \r\ngreater technical assistance. \r\n Fourthly, there is an acute need for better and \r\nmore publicly available information to assist in \r\nCouncil decision-making. In that regard, my delegation \r\nstrongly supports efforts to provide better aggregate \r\ndata to the Council, for example on trends in global \r\nconflict, civilian protection and humanitarian access, in \r\norder to facilitate evidence-based decision-making. \r\n Fifthly, the Council would also benefit from a \r\nserious consideration of the use of the veto. We all \r\nknow the inhibiting effect that the veto — or even the \r\nthreat of the veto — can have on Council deliberations. \r\nThere have been several regrettable occasions in recent \r\nyears when the spectre of the veto had the effect of \r\ndampening debate and delaying much-needed action. \r\nIn our view, the veto can rarely be justified. It is not, \r\nand was never meant to be, a tool for avoiding debate \r\non certain issues. For that reason, Canada believes that \r\nany use of the veto should be publicly explained and \r\njustified. \r\n We also strongly believe that the veto has no \r\nplace in deliberations on situations of genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes, and we urge the five \r\npermanent members to commit themselves to \r\nvoluntarily restrict its use in those situations, which \r\nshock the conscience of humanity. \r\n For the vast majority of Member States, it is \r\nthose reforms that, in the first instance, would pay the \r\ngreatest dividends in terms of access to and \r\naccountability of the Security Council. Canada believes \r\nthat those and other changes to the Council’s working \r\nmethods could significantly enhance its effectiveness \r\nand, in so doing, its legitimacy. We encourage the \r\nCouncil to consider adopting such measures in the \r\nmonths ahead. \r\n In the meantime, allow me to reiterate my \r\nGovernment’s strong support for the draft resolution on \r\nworking methods circulated by Singapore, \r\nLiechtenstein, Costa Rica, Switzerland and Jordan. We \r\nbelieve that the draft resolution merits serious \r\nconsideration by Assembly and Security Council \r\nmembers alike and encourage the drafters to initiate \r\nbroad-based consultations as soon as possible. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The second area that Canada believes should be \r\nstudied as soon as possible is the normative framework \r\nwithin which the Security Council takes its decisions. \r\nOne typical example is the issue of the protection of \r\ncivilians in armed conflict. Canada believes that it is \r\nimportant to strengthen the protection of civilians and \r\nthe related norms and to operationalize those norms so \r\nthat the international community can continue to put \r\nthose principles into practice. \r\n The Council has demonstrated that real progress \r\ncan be made. But real efforts must also still be made. \r\nThe protection of civilians means that the Council must \r\nbe permanently committed, and must be vigilant in \r\n A/62/PV.48\r\n \r\n29 07-59062 \r\n \r\nmonitoring and following up those cases in which \r\nresolutions have laid out clear instructions on that \r\npoint. \r\n Agenda items on women and peace and security \r\nand on children and armed conflict, to which the \r\nCouncil has committed itself, also require systematic \r\nattention, implementation and institutionalization. It is \r\nimportant that the Council be able to demonstrate \r\npolitical will and the capacity necessary to make use of \r\nwhole range of tools available to it in achieving that \r\ngoal, in particular by using effective monitoring and \r\naccountability mechanisms. \r\n In conclusion, Member States have dedicated a \r\nlot of time and energy to the question of the \r\ncomposition of the Security Council over the past few \r\nyears, and they were right to do so. At the sixty-first \r\nsession of the Assembly, the Open-ended Working  \r\n \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security \r\nCouncil made good progress. In the coming months, \r\nwe should make use of the two reports of the \r\nfacilitators (see A/61/47, annexes II and IV), bearing in \r\nmind the goals of representativity, democracy and \r\naccountability, transparency and effectiveness.  \r\n But if Members are unable to reach an agreement \r\nin the near future on the enlargement of the Council, \r\nthen let us nevertheless move ahead in areas, such as \r\nnorms and working methods, where we believe that \r\ntaking measures quickly could achieve concrete results \r\nfor Member States. My delegation stands ready to deal \r\nwith those crucial issues with renewed flexibility and \r\nenergy in the coming months. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
