(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 109 \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/62/1) \r\n \r\n The President: In accordance with the decision \r\ntaken at its 3rd plenary meeting, held on 21 September \r\n2007, the General Assembly will hear a presentation by \r\nthe Secretary-General of his annual report on the work \r\nof the Organization under agenda item 109. I give the \r\nfloor to the Secretary-General. \r\n The Secretary-General (spoke in French): \r\nMr. President, I would like to congratulate you on your \r\nelection. Welcome, all, to New York in this wonderful \r\nseason. For me, it is both a pleasure and an honour to \r\nbe with you for the opening of the general debate of the \r\nsixty-second session of our General Assembly. I \r\nbelieve that this year will be the most intense in our \r\nhistory. I also very firmly believe that, together, we can \r\nmake it one of the most fruitful.  \r\n We have gotten off to a good start. Last week, we \r\nwere able to bring together a high-level meeting of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals Africa Steering Group, \r\nwhich is a clear priority. Leaders from around the \r\nworld also met to discuss the course to be taken in the \r\nMiddle East, in Afghanistan, in Darfur and in Iraq.  \r\n And yesterday we had a very productive \r\nconference on climate change. The aim was to marshal \r\nenergies, political determination and to coordinate our \r\naction by all meeting under the same roof, that of the \r\nUnited Nations, so that we will all be united in \r\ncombating climate change. It was already any \r\nenormous undertaking, and it is in this way that I hope \r\nthat we will work together in the future.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n May I repeat, it is a model of how I hope we can \r\nwork together in the future. \r\n Looking to the coming year, and beyond, we can \r\nforesee a daunting array of challenges to come. They \r\nare problems that respect no borders, that no country, \r\nbig or small, rich or poor, can resolve on its own. \r\n More than ever, we live in an era of collective \r\naction. Often it seems as though everybody wants the \r\nUnited Nations to do everything. We cannot deliver \r\neverything, of course. But that cannot be an excuse for \r\ndoing nothing. \r\n Hence the theme of these remarks — “A Stronger \r\nUnited Nations for a Better World”. \r\n Our changing world needs a stronger United \r\nNations. We all understand the importance of a strong, \r\nrobust, empowered Secretariat. My vision is an \r\nadministration focused on results — efficient, directed, \r\npragmatic and accountable — an administration \r\nrepresenting excellence, integrity and pride in serving \r\nthe global good.  \r\n To deliver on this vision, we must modernize \r\nourselves. We need an internal climate change at the \r\nUnited Nations. We need to think freshly about how we \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 2 \r\n \r\ndo our work. Our main themes should be to simplify, \r\nrationalize and delegate.  \r\n To deliver on the world’s high expectations for \r\nus, we need to be faster, more flexible and mobile. We \r\nneed to pay less attention to rhetoric and more \r\nattention to results — to getting things done. \r\n I place a very high priority on implementing the \r\nmanagement reforms that the General Assembly has \r\npreviously approved to promote greater transparency, \r\naccountability and efficiency. I welcome the progress \r\nwe have made over the past nine months in \r\nstreamlining our budget processes, crafting our Capital \r\nMaster Plan and putting our financial house in order. I \r\nam especially grateful to the 102 Governments that \r\nhave paid their annual budget assessments in full. \r\n Together, we successfully reorganized our \r\npeacekeeping operations, affecting more than 100,000 \r\nUnited Nations personnel in 18 multinational missions. \r\nI plan to continue the effort by strengthening the \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs. We must become more \r\nproactive in responding to crises. Well-planned and \r\nwell-executed preventive diplomacy can save many \r\nlives and forestall many tragedies — a core Charter \r\nresponsibility of our United Nations. \r\n I will leave no stone unturned to end the tragedy \r\nin Darfur. The Government of Sudan must live up to its \r\npledge to join comprehensive peace talks and \r\nimplement a ceasefire. We must also move forward \r\nwith the agreement that ended the long-running civil \r\nwar between north and south and prepare for elections \r\nin 2009.  \r\n The crisis in Darfur grew from many causes. Any \r\nenduring solution must address all of them — security, \r\npolitics, resources, water, humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment issues. There, as elsewhere, we must deal \r\nwith the root causes of conflict, however complex and \r\nentangled. \r\n Peace in the Middle East is vital to the stability of \r\nthe region and the world. We know what is required — \r\nan end to violence, an end to occupation, the creation \r\nof a Palestinian State at peace with itself and Israel, \r\nand a comprehensive regional peace between Israel and \r\nthe Arab world.  \r\n With renewed leadership from the Arab world and \r\nthe United States, coupled with the efforts of the \r\nQuartet representative, Mr. Tony Blair, the elements for \r\na renewed push for peace are being brought together.  \r\n We also sincerely hope that the Lebanese people, \r\nthrough national reconciliation, will be able to restore \r\npolitical and social stability by electing their new \r\npresident in accordance with their constitutional \r\nprocess.  \r\n Iraq has become the whole world’s problem. With \r\nthe newly adopted Security Council resolution 1770 \r\n(2007), the United Nations has an important role to \r\nplay in promoting political negotiation and national \r\nreconciliation, as well as in providing humanitarian \r\nassistance to the Iraqi people. But we recognize that \r\nthe safety and security of United Nations staff is \r\nparamount.  \r\n In Afghanistan, we must work more effectively \r\nwith our partners to deal with drug trafficking and the \r\nfinancing of terrorism.  \r\n We are closely following events in Myanmar. We \r\nagain urge the authorities in Myanmar to exercise \r\nutmost restraint, to engage without delay in dialogue \r\nwith all the relevant parties to the national \r\nreconciliation process on the issues of concern to the \r\npeople of Myanmar. In this regard, my Special Adviser \r\nis expected to visit Myanmar very soon.  \r\n From my first day in office, I have stressed the \r\nimportance of disarmament, as mandated most recently \r\nin the General Assembly’s support for my proposal to \r\nestablish an Office for Disarmament Affairs. We must \r\nreinvigorate our efforts to stop the proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction and related technology, \r\nespecially to prevent such material from falling into the \r\nhands of terrorists. I am encouraged by recent progress \r\non the issue of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. I sincerely hope that the forthcoming inter-\r\nKorean summit meeting will create a historic \r\nmomentum to bring peace, security and eventually a \r\npeaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula. I am \r\nconfident that we will reach a negotiated solution with \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. Our ultimate goal remains \r\nthe complete elimination of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. If we fail, these weapons may one day \r\neliminate us. \r\n We at the United Nations must take the long \r\nview, in politics as in life. Even as we deal with the \r\nhere and now, we must think about tomorrow. \r\nYesterday, I spoke about climate change as a defining \r\nissue of our time. We all agreed: now is the time for \r\naction. Let us go to Bali and make a breakthrough. We \r\nalso agreed that solutions to global warming cannot \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n3 07-51578 \r\n \r\ncome at the expense of economic development, the \r\nsecond pillar of the work of the United Nations. Issues \r\nof development and social equity cannot take a back \r\nseat to issues of peace and security.  \r\n This year marks the midpoint for our Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We have had successes. Around \r\nthe world, unprecedented numbers of people are lifting \r\nthemselves out of poverty. Yet the rising tide of \r\nglobalization has not lifted all boats.  \r\n We see this most acutely in Africa, home to most \r\nof what one World Bank economist calls “the bottom \r\nbillion” of the world’s poor. We must pay careful \r\nattention to these nations with special needs. We must \r\nheed the voices of the world’s poorest peoples, who too \r\noften go unheard.  \r\n That is why I convened the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Africa Steering Group earlier this \r\nmonth, bringing together leaders of major multilateral \r\ndevelopment organizations.  \r\n Our Millennium Development Goals remain \r\nachievable so long as we help the poorest nations break \r\nfree of the traps that ensnare them. Some of those traps \r\nrelate to bad governance, others to disease and poor \r\nhealth care. It is intolerable that HIV/AIDS continues \r\nas a modern-day scourge. It is intolerable that almost \r\n10 million children die each year before their fifth \r\nbirthday, mostly from such preventable diseases as \r\nmalaria. It is a scar on the moral conscience of the \r\nworld. \r\n This is not to say that we will do things that these \r\ncountries should, and can and do, do for themselves. \r\nThe “Asian Miracle” has shown that successful \r\ndevelopment owes much to smart choices and rigorous \r\nexecution.  \r\n For our part, we must try to make our multilateral \r\ndevelopment programmes more effective and coherent, \r\nto better integrate our efforts in health, education, \r\nagriculture and infrastructure so as to deliver better \r\nresults. \r\n For their part, donor nations must do more to \r\ndeliver on their promises of aid, debt relief and market \r\naccess. Open, fair and non-discriminatory market \r\naccess, trading and financial systems are critical to the \r\nfuture of every developing country, in Africa and \r\nelsewhere. That is why we must do our utmost to \r\nadvance the Doha Development Agenda, with its \r\nemphasis on development and aid for trade. \r\n The third pillar of the United Nations, human \r\nrights, is codified in the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, which marks its sixtieth anniversary in \r\n2008. The Human Rights Council must live up to its \r\nresponsibilities as the torchbearer for human rights \r\nconsistently and equitably around the world. I will \r\nstrive to translate the concept of our responsibility to \r\nprotect from words to deeds, to ensure timely action so \r\nthat populations do not face genocide, ethnic cleansing \r\nor crimes against humanity. \r\n Our international tribunals continue their work, \r\nfrom Rwanda to Sierra Leone and soon in Lebanon. \r\nThe age of impunity is dead. \r\n Meanwhile, the brave and exceptionally \r\ncommitted United Nations humanitarian aid workers \r\ndo their best to save lives. They help protect civilian \r\npopulations from the degradations of armed militias, \r\nchildren from starvation and women from shameful \r\nviolence.  \r\n This year did not bring a natural disaster on the \r\nscale of the 2004 tsunami, but the intensity of floods, \r\ndroughts and other extreme weather, perhaps made \r\nworse by climate change, have brought pain and \r\nsuffering to many millions. This, above all, is the \r\nUnited Nations front line. We stand up to help those \r\nwho cannot help themselves. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n I am often filled with a sense of deep humility in \r\nthe face of the great challenges ahead of us. So many \r\nhopes have been placed in us, but it is our duty to \r\nrespond to these hopes with perseverance, patience, \r\ncourage and discipline. We must transform the way in \r\nwhich the United Nations does its work, the way that \r\nwe work. Let us focus more on results, rather than \r\nbureaucratic procedures. The pendulum of history is \r\nswinging in our favour. Multilateralism is back. An \r\nincreasingly interdependent world acknowledges that \r\nthe United Nations is the best way — in fact the only \r\nway — to take up the challenges of the future. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: There are over 180 languages \r\nspoken in the five boroughs of New York. This \r\ncosmopolitan city really is a microcosm of the world. \r\nWhat better place than this to bring together at the \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 4 \r\n \r\nhighest level all 192 Member States of the United \r\nNations?  \r\n We are here today to debate the urgent challenges \r\nthat our peoples and nations face collectively and \r\nindividually. This is one of the rare occasions each year \r\nwhen so many heads of State and Government gather \r\ntogether in one place. What a unique opportunity. This \r\nhistoric Hall is indeed the parliament of the peoples of \r\nthe world.  \r\n It is therefore my sincere honour and pleasure to \r\nwelcome you all to the general debate. The theme for \r\nthis year’s debate is “Responding to Climate Change”. \r\nI would also like to use this opportunity to draw your \r\nattention to the other key priorities we will work on \r\ntogether during the sixty-second session. \r\n As I set out in more detail at the opening of this \r\nsession, in consultations with members, I identified \r\nfive priority topics that we need to address in this \r\nsession: climate change, financing for development, \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, countering \r\nterrorism and renewing the management, effectiveness \r\nand coherence of the Organization, including Security \r\nCouncil reform. I believe that those five priorities \r\nrepresent an equilibrium of interests that all Member \r\nStates can identify with and take forward successfully \r\ntogether.  \r\n Climate change and its dramatic effects are \r\nincreasingly visible and increasingly violent. The irony \r\nis that those least responsible for it will suffer most. \r\nYesterday, many participants reaffirmed that and sent a \r\nstrong political message that the time for action had \r\ncome. That is why I have proposed creating a \r\ncomprehensive road map to guide the way forward for \r\nthe United Nations system and its Member States.  \r\n First, we need to take stock to outline the \r\ninstruments we have and the structures necessary to \r\naddress climate change. Then, we need a clearer vision \r\nof the way forward. And finally, we must formulate a \r\nstrategy to get us there together. Modernizing our \r\nmanagement and implementing greater coherence \r\nacross the system will enable the Organization to \r\ndeliver better results on all the priorities I have \r\noutlined. And to make swift progress, I call on all \r\nmembers today to renew their support for the \r\nSecretary-General in his endeavour to advance the \r\nagenda of the United Nations and to make it more \r\neffective and modern.  \r\n Together, dealing systematically with substance, \r\nthe General Assembly can demonstrate its global \r\nleadership on these important issues. To revitalize this \r\nHouse is also to renew our faith in each other and in \r\nthe Organization’s cherished values. \r\n The basic values, norms and principles of \r\ninternational relations are undergoing a profound \r\ntransition. This is characterized by great opportunities \r\nas well as by great challenges.  \r\n The patterns of life of individuals and \r\ncommunities are increasingly shaped by global \r\neconomic forces. Overall, our wealth is increasing. \r\nMore and more people are benefiting from the \r\nexpansion of trade, commerce and new jobs in a \r\nsystem based on the rule of law and human rights. But \r\nfor the benefits of development to be sustained, they \r\nhave to be shared by all. Sharp social divisions and \r\ninequalities continue to persist. About half the world’s \r\npeople still live on less than two dollars per day. In a \r\nworld where we are confronted by images of \r\nprosperity, the burden of the expectation of a better \r\nfuture is growing daily. Education, the key to \r\nempowerment, is for some more accessible. Yet, each \r\nday, 100 million young children do not receive an \r\neducation. Let us spare no effort in moving the world \r\ntowards a sense of genuine belonging, shared \r\nopportunity and responsibility. \r\n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) is not solely a test of our ability to deliver on \r\nour promises. It is, above all, a test of our moral \r\nconvictions. That is why, in consultation with the \r\nSecretary-General, I intend to work closely with \r\nmembers to hold an MDG leaders meeting here at the \r\nUnited Nations during this session.  \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n In this era of globalization, we face other \r\nchallenges. Capital flows are becoming more and more \r\ncomplex, volatile and opaque. We are increasingly \r\nvulnerable to the new threats to which we need to \r\nrespond. Terrorism, arms trafficking, weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, pandemics and the consequences of \r\nclimate change are but a few examples. That is why I \r\nam calling upon members to take every opportunity \r\noffered to us in the course of this session to move \r\ntowards sustainable peace, in particular in the Middle \r\nEast, Iraq, Afghanistan and Darfur.  \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n5 07-51578 \r\n \r\n We must rise to those challenges in this \r\nincreasingly fast-paced world. Political decision-\r\nmaking processes can seem very slow and too \r\ncumbersome. As Ms. Al Khalifa said during the \r\nprevious General Assembly session, we are facing a \r\ngrowing gap between the actions that we must take and \r\nthe multilateral means at our disposal to do so. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n By confronting the challenges of our time and \r\nnurturing new patterns of cooperation, we can forge a \r\nnew culture of international relations, demonstrate the \r\ncourage to rise above ourselves and achieve our \r\ncommon goals. We must act with purpose, \r\ndetermination and vision, all of us accepting our shared \r\nbut differentiated responsibility to work together for \r\nchange. If fully implemented, the commitments made \r\nat the 2005 World Summit and at other summits and \r\nconferences can create the conditions for lasting \r\nprosperity and stability based on the principles of \r\npeace and security, international development, human \r\nrights and the rule of law. \r\n To demonstrate this and to achieve more during \r\nthis session and in the future, the General Assembly \r\nshould be more of a dialogue, not a monologue; it \r\nshould be more engaging and insightful; it should be \r\nmore focused on results and should continually strive \r\nto exemplify the spirit of cooperation and mutual \r\nrespect.  \r\n There is an old saying: “Keep your mind level. If \r\nthe mind is level, the whole world will be level”. It is \r\nmy hope that that spirit will guide us in our joint \r\nefforts, not only during this session, but in the future. \r\nActing in that manner requires us to realize that all the \r\ndistinctions of the world are caused by the \r\ndiscriminatory views of the mind. \r\n Before giving the floor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I should like to remind members that the list \r\nof speakers has been created on the basis that \r\nstatements will have a time limit of 15 minutes per \r\nstatement to enable all the speakers to be heard at any \r\ngiven meeting. Within this time frame, I should like to \r\nappeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a \r\nnormal speed so that interpretation may be properly \r\nprovided.  \r\n I should also like to draw the General Assembly’s \r\nattention to the decision made by the Assembly at \r\nprevious sessions, namely, that the practice of \r\nexpressing congratulations inside the General \r\nAssembly Hall after a speech has been delivered are \r\nstrongly discouraged. In that connection, I should like \r\nto invite speakers in the general debate after delivering \r\ntheir statements to exit the General Assembly Hall \r\nthrough room GA-200, located behind the podium, \r\nbefore returning to their seats.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nproceed in the same manner during the general debate \r\nof the sixty-second session? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The President: Finally, I should like to draw it to \r\nthe attention of members that during the general \r\ndebate, official photographs of speakers are taken by \r\nthe Department of Public Information. Members \r\ninterested in obtaining those photographs are requested \r\nto contact the Photo Library of the United Nations. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President \r\nof the Federative Republic of Brazil \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Federative Republic of \r\nBrazil. \r\n Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, \r\nPresident of the Federative Republic of Brazil, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Da Silva (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I congratulate \r\nthe Secretary-General on his assumption of such a high \r\noffice within the international system. I welcome his \r\ndecision to encourage high-level debate on the \r\nextremely grave issue of climate change. It is most \r\nappropriate that that discussion take place here at the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n Let us not delude ourselves. If the groundwork of \r\nglobal development is not rebuilt, the risks of \r\nunprecedented environmental and human catastrophe \r\nwill grow. We must overcome the apparently pragmatic \r\nand sophisticated notion — which is actually \r\nanachronistic, predatory and senseless — that profits \r\nand wealth can grow forever, at any cost. There are \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 6 \r\n \r\nprices that humanity cannot afford to pay at the risk of \r\ndestroying the material and spiritual foundations of our \r\ncollective existence — at the risk of self-destruction. \r\nThe preservation of life must prevail over mindless \r\ngreed. \r\n The world will not correct its irresponsible \r\nrelationship with nature, however, until we change the \r\nway development relates to social justice. If we want to \r\nsalvage our common heritage, a new and more \r\nbalanced distribution of wealth is needed, both \r\ninternationally and within each country. Social equity \r\nis our best weapon against the planet’s degradation. \r\nEach one of us must do our part. It is unacceptable that \r\nthe cost of the irresponsibility of a privileged few be \r\nshouldered by the dispossessed of the Earth. \r\n The most highly industrialized countries can and \r\nmust set the example. Full compliance with their \r\ncommitments under the Kyoto Protocol is \r\nindispensable. That is not enough, however. We need to \r\nset more ambitious goals for 2012 onwards and we \r\nmust take strong action to ensure universal accession to \r\nthe Protocol. Developing countries must also help in \r\ncombating climate change. We need clear national \r\nstrategies to hold Governments accountable to their \r\npeoples. \r\n Brazil will soon launch its own national plan to \r\ncombat climate change. The Amazon forest is one of \r\nthe areas most vulnerable to global warming, but the \r\nthreats cover all continents. They range from greater \r\ndesertification to the outright disappearance of \r\nterritories or even of entire countries lost to rising sea \r\nlevels. Brazil has undertaken major efforts to minimize \r\nthe impact of climate change. Suffice it to say that, in \r\nrecent years, we have halved the rate of deforestation \r\nin the Amazon region. \r\n Results like that should come as no surprise. \r\nBrazil will under no circumstance abdicate either its \r\nsovereignty or its responsibilities in the Amazon. Our \r\nrecent achievements derive from an increasing \r\npresence of the Brazilian State in the region, fostering \r\nsustainable development with economic, social, \r\neducational and cultural benefits for its more than \r\n20 million inhabitants. \r\n I am convinced that our experience can enrich \r\nsimilar endeavours in other countries. In Nairobi, \r\nBrazil proposed the adoption of economic and financial \r\nincentives to reduce deforestation on a global scale. We \r\nmust also increase South-South cooperation while \r\npromoting innovative modalities of joint action with \r\ndeveloped countries. That is how we can materialize \r\nthe principle of shared but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n It is very important to adopt an integrated \r\npolitical approach to the environmental agenda as a \r\nwhole. Brazil hosted the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development — the Earth Summit. \r\nWe need to review what has been achieved since then, \r\nand set a new course of action. I therefore propose that \r\nwe hold a new Conference, in 2012, the “Rio +20” \r\nConference to be hosted by Brazil. \r\n We will not overcome the terrible impacts of \r\nclimate change until humanity changes its patterns of \r\nenergy production and consumption. The world \r\nurgently needs to develop a new energy matrix in \r\nwhich bio-fuels will play a vital role. Bio-fuels \r\nsignificantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With its \r\nincreased and more efficient use of ethanol, Brazil has \r\nkept 644 million tons of carbon dioxide from being \r\nemitted into the atmosphere over the past 30 years. \r\n Bio-fuels can be much more than a clean-energy \r\nalternative. Ethanol and bio-diesel can open up \r\nexcellent opportunities for over 100 poor and \r\ndeveloping countries in Latin America, Asia and, \r\nespecially, Africa. They can enhance energy autonomy, \r\nwithout costly investments. They can create jobs and \r\nincome and promote family farming. They can help \r\nbalance trade deficits by reducing imports and \r\ngenerating surplus exportable crops. \r\n Brazil’s experience over three decades has shown \r\nthat bio-fuel production does not affect food security. \r\nSugarcane crops cover just 1 per cent of the country’s \r\narable land, and yields continue to rise. People do not \r\ngo hungry around the world for lack of food, but rather \r\nfor lack of income, which afflicts almost 1 billion men, \r\nwomen and children. \r\n It is entirely possible to combine bio-fuels with \r\nenvironmental protection and food production. We will \r\nensure that bio-fuel production complies with all social \r\nand environmental guarantees. Our Government has \r\ndecided to implement a complete agro-ecological \r\nzoning of the country in order to identify farmland best \r\nsuited to producing bio-fuels. Brazilian bio-fuels will \r\nreach the world market with a seal of assurance for \r\ntheir social, labour and environmental quality. \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n7 07-51578 \r\n \r\n In 2008, Brazil is set to host an international \r\nconference on bio-fuels that will lay the foundations \r\nfor wide-ranging global cooperation. I hereby invite all \r\ncountries to participate. \r\n Sustainable development is not just an \r\nenvironmental issue; it is also a social challenge. We \r\nare making Brazil less unequal and more dynamic. The \r\ncountry is growing again, creating jobs and distributing \r\nincome. This time, opportunities are being created for \r\nall. We are paying off a centuries-old social debt, while \r\nat the same time investing heavily in quality education, \r\nscience and technology.  \r\n We have honoured our commitment to “zero \r\nhunger” by sweeping away that scourge from the lives \r\nof over 45 million people. We achieved the first \r\nMillennium Development Goal 10 years ahead of \r\nschedule, cutting extreme poverty in our country by \r\nmore than half. Fighting hunger and poverty should be \r\nthe concern of all peoples. A global society held back \r\nby growing income disparities is simply not viable. \r\nThere will be no lasting peace if we do not \r\nprogressively reduce inequality. \r\n In 2004, we launched the global Action against \r\nHunger and Poverty. Early results are encouraging, \r\nparticularly the creation of the International Drug \r\nPurchase Facility (UNITAID). UNITAID has already \r\nachieved 45-per-cent price cuts in drugs used against \r\nAIDS, malaria and tuberculosis for the poorest \r\ncountries of Africa. The time has come for us to give it \r\na new push. We cannot allow ideas that so mobilized \r\nour countries to fade because of bureaucratic inertia. \r\n However, the final defeat of poverty demands \r\nmore than international solidarity. It depends above all \r\non new economic relations that no longer penalize poor \r\ncountries. The Doha Round of the World Trade \r\nOrganization should promote a true pact for \r\ndevelopment by adopting fair and balanced rules for \r\ninternational trade. Farm subsidies that make the rich \r\nricher and the poor poorer are no longer acceptable. We \r\ncannot accept agricultural protectionism that \r\nperpetuates dependency and underdevelopment. Brazil \r\nwill spare no effort for a successful conclusion of those \r\nnegotiations, which must, above all, benefit the poorest \r\ncountries. \r\n Building a new international order is no \r\nrhetorical turn of phrase; it is a matter of common \r\nsense. Brazil is proud of its contribution to South \r\nAmerican integration, particularly through the \r\nCommon Market of the South. We are working to bring \r\ntogether peoples and regions. We seek to enhance \r\npolitical dialogue and economic links with the Arab \r\nworld, Africa and Asia, and we do so without \r\nsacrificing our traditional partners. Brazil has set up an \r\ninnovative cooperation mechanism with India and \r\nSouth Africa. Together we are working on specific \r\nprojects to help in various countries, including Haiti \r\nand Guinea-Bissau. \r\n We all agree on the need for increased \r\nparticipation by developing countries in the major \r\ninternational decision-making bodies, in particular the \r\nSecurity Council. The time has come to move from \r\nwords to action. We appreciate recent proposals by \r\nPresident Sarkozy to reform the Security Council, with \r\nthe inclusion of developing nations. A review of \r\ndecision-making processes within international \r\nfinancial institutions is also required. \r\n The United Nations is our best tool to deal with \r\ntoday’s international challenges. It is through \r\nmultilateral diplomacy that we find the way to \r\nfostering peace and development. Brazil’s role \r\nalongside other Latin America and Caribbean nations \r\nin the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \r\nhighlights our efforts to strengthen multilateral \r\ninstitutions. In Haiti, we are showing that peace and \r\nstability are built with democracy and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Walking into this building, representatives to the \r\nUnited Nations can admire a work of art that Brazil \r\npresented to the United Nations 50 years ago. I am \r\nreferring to the murals that portray war and peace \r\npainted by a great Brazilian artist, Cândido Portinari. \r\nThe suffering so expressively portrayed in the mural \r\ndepicting war brings to mind the United Nations \r\ncrucial responsibility in containing the risk of armed \r\nconflict. The second mural reminds us that peace is \r\nmuch more than the absence of war. It evokes well-\r\nbeing, health and harmonious coexistence with nature. \r\nIt calls for social justice, freedom and overcoming the \r\nscourges of hunger and poverty. It is not by mere \r\nchance that those who enter the building face the mural \r\nportraying war, while those who leave see the mural \r\ndepicting peace. The artist’s message is simple but \r\npowerful: transforming suffering into hope, and war \r\ninto peace, is the essence of the United Nations \r\nmission. Brazil will continue to work to realize those \r\nhigh expectations. \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 8 \r\n \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Brazil for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Brazil, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. George W. Bush, President of the \r\nUnited States of America \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the United States of \r\nAmerica. \r\n Mr. George W. Bush, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. George Walker Bush, \r\nPresident of the United States of America, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Bush: Thank you for the opportunity \r\nto address the General Assembly of the United Nations.  \r\n Sixty years ago, representatives from 16 nations \r\ngathered to begin deliberations on a new international \r\nbill of rights. The document they produced is called the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and it stands \r\nas a landmark achievement in the history of human \r\nliberty. The Declaration opens by recognizing the \r\ninherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of \r\nall members of the human family as the foundation of \r\nfreedom and justice and peace in the world. As we \r\ngather for the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly, the standards of the Declaration must guide \r\nour work in this world.  \r\n Achieving the promise of the Declaration requires \r\nconfronting long-term threats. It also requires \r\nanswering the immediate needs of today. \r\n We nations in this Hall have our differences. Yet, \r\nthere are some areas where we can all agree. When \r\ninnocent people are trapped in a life of murder and \r\nfear, the Declaration is not being upheld. When \r\nmillions of children starve to death or perish from a \r\nmosquito bite, we are not doing our duty in the world. \r\nWhen whole societies are cut off from the prosperity of \r\nthe global economy, we are all worse off. Changing \r\nthese underlying conditions is what the Declaration \r\ncalls the work of larger freedom, and it must be the \r\nwork of every nation in this Assembly. \r\n This great institution must work for great \r\npurposes, to free people from tyranny and violence, \r\nhunger and disease, illiteracy and ignorance and \r\npoverty and despair. Every member of the United \r\nNations must join in this mission of liberation. The \r\nfirst mission of the United Nations requires liberating \r\npeople from tyranny and violence. The first article of \r\nthe Universal Declaration begins by stating that all \r\nhuman beings are born free and equal in dignity and \r\nrights. This truth is denied by terrorists and extremists \r\nwho kill the innocent with the aim of imposing their \r\nhateful vision on humanity. The followers of this \r\nviolent ideology are a threat to civilized people \r\neverywhere. All civilized nations must work together \r\nto stop them by sharing intelligence about their \r\nnetworks and choking off their finances and bringing to \r\njustice their operatives. In the long run, the best way to \r\ndefeat extremists is to defeat their dark ideology with a \r\nmore hopeful vision — the vision of liberty that \r\nfounded this body. \r\n The United States salutes the nations that have \r\nrecently taken strides towards liberty, including \r\nUkraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Liberia, \r\nSierra Leone and Morocco. The Palestinian territories \r\nhave moderate leaders — mainstream leaders — who \r\nare working to build free institutions that fight terror, \r\nenforce the law and respond to the needs of their \r\npeople. The international community must support \r\nthese leaders so that we can advance the vision of two \r\ndemocratic States — Israel and Palestine — living side \r\nby side in peace and security. \r\n Brave citizens in Lebanon and Afghanistan and \r\nIraq have made the choice for democracy. Yet, the \r\nextremists have responded by targeting them for \r\nmurder. This is not a show of strength; it is evidence of \r\nfear; and the extremists are doing everything within \r\ntheir power to bring down these young democracies. \r\nThe people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have \r\nasked for our help, and every civilized nation has a \r\nresponsibility to stand with them. Every civilized \r\nnation also has a responsibility to stand up for the \r\npeople suffering under dictatorship. In Belarus, North \r\nKorea, Syria and Iran, brutal regimes deny their people \r\nthe fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal \r\nDeclaration. \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n9 07-51578 \r\n \r\n Americans are outraged by the situation in \r\nBurma, where a military junta has imposed a 19-year \r\nreign of fear. Basic freedoms of speech, assembly and \r\nworship are severely restricted. Ethnic minorities are \r\npersecuted. Forced child labour, human trafficking and \r\nrape are common. The regime is holding more than \r\n1,000 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, \r\nwhose party was elected overwhelmingly by the \r\nBurmese people in 1990. \r\n The ruling junta remains unyielding, yet the \r\npeople’s desire for freedom is unmistakable. This \r\nmorning, I am announcing a series of steps to help \r\nbring peaceful change to Burma. The United States will \r\ntighten economic sanctions on the leaders of the \r\nregime and their financial backers. We will impose an \r\nexpanded visa ban on those responsible for the most \r\negregious violations of human rights — as well as their \r\nfamily members. We will continue to support the \r\nefforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate \r\nsuffering in Burma. And I urge the United Nations and \r\nall nations to use their diplomatic and economic \r\nleverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their \r\nfreedom. \r\n In Cuba, the long rule of a cruel dictator is \r\nnearing its end. The Cuban people are ready for their \r\nfreedom. And as that nation enters a period of \r\ntransition, the United Nations must insist on free \r\nspeech, free assembly and, ultimately, free and \r\ncompetitive elections. \r\n In Zimbabwe, ordinary citizens suffer under a \r\ntyrannical regime. The Government has cracked down \r\non peaceful calls for reform and has forced millions to \r\nflee their homeland. The behaviour of the Mugabe \r\nregime is an assault on its people and an affront to the \r\nprinciples of the Universal Declaration. The United \r\nNations must insist on change in Harare and must insist \r\non freedom for the people of Zimbabwe. \r\n In Sudan, innocent civilians are suffering \r\nrepression; and in the Darfur region, many are losing \r\ntheir lives to genocide. America has responded with \r\ntough sanctions against those responsible for the \r\nviolence. We have provided more than $2 billion in \r\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping aid. I look forward to \r\nattending a Security Council meeting that will focus on \r\nDarfur, chaired by the French President. I appreciate \r\nFrance’s leadership in helping to stabilize Sudan’s \r\nneighbours. The United Nations must answer this \r\nchallenge to conscience and live up to its promise to \r\npromptly deploy peacekeeping forces to Darfur. \r\n Secondly, the mission of the United Nations \r\nrequires liberating people from hunger and disease. \r\nArticle 25 of the Universal Declaration states that \r\neveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate \r\nfor the health and well-being of himself and of his \r\nfamily, including food, clothing, housing, and medical \r\ncare. Around the world, the United Nations is carrying \r\nout noble efforts to live up to these words. \r\n Feeding the hungry has long been a special \r\ncalling for my nation. Today, more than half the \r\nworld’s food assistance comes from America. We send \r\nemergency food stocks to starving people, from camps \r\nin Sudan to slums around the world. I have proposed \r\nan innovative initiative to alleviate hunger under which \r\nAmerica would purchase the crops of local farmers in \r\nAfrica and elsewhere, rather than shipping in food \r\nfrom the developed world. This would help build up \r\nlocal agriculture and break the cycle of famine in the \r\ndeveloping world, and I urge our United States \r\nCongress to support this initiative. \r\n Many in this Hall are bringing the spirit of \r\ngenerosity to fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria. Five \r\nyears ago, in sub-Saharan Africa, an AIDS diagnosis \r\nwas widely considered a death sentence, and fewer \r\nthan 50,000 people infected with the virus were \r\nreceiving treatment. The world responded by creating \r\nthe Global Fund, which is working with Governments \r\nand the private sector to fight the disease around the \r\nworld. The United States decided to take these efforts a \r\nstep further by launching the $15 billion Emergency \r\nPlan for AIDS Relief. Since 2003, this effort has \r\nhelped bring cutting-edge medicines to more than a \r\nmillion people in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a good start. \r\nSo earlier this year, I proposed to double our initial \r\ncommitment — to $30 billion. By coming together, the \r\nworld can turn the tide against HIV/AIDS, once and for \r\nall. \r\n Malaria is another common killer. In some \r\ncountries, malaria takes as many lives as HIV/AIDS, \r\nthe vast majority of them children under the age of \r\nfive. Every one of these deaths is unnecessary, because \r\nthe disease is preventable and treatable. The world \r\nknows what it takes to stop malaria — bed nets, indoor \r\nspraying and medicine to treat the disease. Two years \r\nago, America launched a $1.2 billion malaria initiative. \r\nOther nations and the private sector are making vital \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 10 \r\n \r\ncontributions as well. I call on every Member State to \r\nmaintain its focus, to find new ways to join this cause \r\nand to bring us closer to the day when deaths caused by \r\nmalaria are no more. \r\n Thirdly, the mission of the United Nations \r\nrequires liberating people from the chains of illiteracy \r\nand ignorance. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration \r\nstates that everyone has the right to education. When \r\nnations make the investments needed to educate their \r\npeople, the whole world benefits. Better education \r\nunleashes the talent and potential of citizens and adds \r\nto the prosperity of all of us. Better education promotes \r\nbetter health and greater independence. Better \r\neducation increases the strength of democracy and \r\nweakens the appeal of violent ideologies. So the United \r\nStates is joining with nations around the world to help \r\nthem provide a better education for their people. \r\n A good education starts with good teachers. In \r\npartnership with other nations, America has helped \r\ntrain more than 600,000 teachers and administrators. A \r\ngood education requires good textbooks. So, in \r\npartnership with other nations, America has distributed \r\ntens of millions of textbooks. A good education \r\nrequires access to good schools. So, in partnership with \r\nother nations, America is helping nations raise \r\nstandards in their schools at home and providing \r\nscholarships to help students come to schools in the \r\nUnited States. And in all our education efforts, our \r\nnation is working to expand access for women and \r\ngirls so that the opportunity to get a decent education is \r\nopen to all. \r\n Finally, the mission of the United Nations \r\nrequires liberating people from poverty and despair. \r\nArticle 23 of the Universal Declaration states that \r\neveryone has the right to work, to free choice of \r\nemployment and to just and favourable conditions of \r\nwork. In the twenty-first century, this requires ensuring \r\nthat people in poor countries have the same \r\nopportunity to benefit from the global economy that \r\ncitizens of wealthy countries have. \r\n The United Nations provides vital economic \r\nassistance designed to help developing nations grow \r\ntheir economies and reach their potential. The United \r\nStates agrees with that position. We have dramatically \r\nincreased our own development assistance, and we are \r\ndelivering that aid in innovative ways. We started the \r\nMillennium Challenge Account to reward nations that \r\ngovern justly, fight corruption, invest in their people \r\nand promote economic freedom. With this aid, we are \r\nreaching out to developing nations in partnership, not \r\npaternalism. And we are ensuring that our aid dollars \r\nreach those who need them and achieve results. \r\n In the long run, the best way to lift people out of \r\npoverty is through trade and investment. A nation that \r\nis open and trading with the world will create \r\neconomic rewards that far exceed anything it could get \r\nthrough foreign aid. During the 1990s, developing \r\nnations that significantly lowered tariffs saw their per \r\ncapita income grow about three times faster than other \r\ndeveloping countries. Open markets ignite growth, \r\nencourage investment, increase transparency, \r\nstrengthen the rule of law and help countries help \r\nthemselves. \r\n The international community now has a historic \r\nchance to open markets around the world by \r\nconcluding a successful Doha Round of trade talks. A \r\nsuccessful Doha outcome would mean real and \r\nsubstantial openings in agriculture, goods and services, \r\nand real and substantial reductions in trade-distorting \r\nsubsidies. The world’s largest trading nations, \r\nincluding major developing countries, have a special \r\nresponsibility to make the tough political decisions to \r\nreduce trade barriers. America has the wí11 and \r\nflexibility to make those necessary decisions. Our \r\nnegotiators are demonstrating that spirit in Geneva. I \r\nurge other leaders to direct their negotiators to do the \r\nsame. And I am optimistic that we can reach a good \r\nDoha agreement and seize this once-in-a-generation \r\nopportunity. \r\n In the meantime, America wí11 continue to \r\npursue agreements that open trade and investment \r\nwherever we can. We recently signed free-trade \r\nagreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama and South \r\nKorea. These agreements embody the values of open \r\nmarkets, transparent and fair regulation, respect for \r\nprivate property and resolving disputes under rules of \r\ninternational law. These are good agreements. They are \r\nnow ready for a congressional vote, and I urge our \r\nCongress to approve them as soon as possible. \r\n As America works with the United Nations to \r\nalleviate immediate needs, we are also coming together \r\nto address longer-term challenges. Together, we are \r\npreparing for pandemics that could cause death and \r\nsuffering on a global scale. Together, we are working \r\nto stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Together, we are confronting the \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n11 07-51578 \r\n \r\nchallenges of energy security, environmental quality \r\nand climate change. I appreciate the discussions on \r\nclimate change led by the Secretary-General last night. \r\nI look forward to further discussions at the meeting of \r\nmajor economies in Washington later this week. \r\n The goals I have outlined today cannot be \r\nachieved overnight, and they cannot be achieved \r\nwithout reform of this vital institution. The United \r\nStates is committed to a strong and vibrant United \r\nNations. Yet the American people are disappointed by \r\nthe failures of the Human Rights Council. That body \r\nhas been silent on repression by regimes from Havana \r\nand Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing \r\nits criticism excessively on Israel. To be credible on \r\nhuman rights in the world, the United Nations must \r\nfirst reform its own Human Rights Council. \r\n Some have also called for reform of the structure \r\nof the Security Council, including an expansion of its \r\nmembership. The United States is open to this \r\nprospect. We believe that Japan is well qualified for \r\npermanent membership on the Security Council and \r\nthat other nations should be considered as well. The \r\nUnited States will listen to all good ideas, and we will \r\nsupport changes to the Security Council as part of \r\nbroader United Nations reform. And in all we do, I call \r\non Member States to work for an institution that \r\nadheres to strict ethical standards and lives up to the \r\nhigh principles of the Universal Declaration. \r\n With the commitment and courage of those in this \r\nHall, we can build a world where people are free to \r\nspeak, assemble and worship as they wish — a world \r\nwhere children in every nation grow up healthy, get a \r\ndecent education and look to the future with hope — a \r\nworld where opportunity crosses every border. America \r\nwill lead towards that vision, in which all are created \r\nequal and free to pursue their dreams. That is the \r\nfounding conviction of my country. It is the promise \r\nthat established this body. And, with our determination, \r\nit can be the future of our world.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nStates of America for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. George W. Bush, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ghana. \r\n Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Kufuor (Ghana): Permit me first to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. The \r\nAssembly is certainly the richer for the wealth of \r\ndiplomatic experience that you bring to the job. \r\n Yesterday there was a vibrant debate in this Hall \r\non the critical issue of climate change, which is a main \r\ntheme of this year’s session. The phenomenon of \r\nconsensus among contributors portends catastrophic \r\nimpact on the whole globe, but more especially on poor \r\ncountries, which are least equipped financially and \r\ntechnologically to adapt in a sustained manner. Since it \r\nis generally accepted that the threat is universal, it is \r\nGhana’s considered view that the United Nations \r\nshould be vested with the authority to fashion a full-\r\nfledged agency equipped with the necessary scientific \r\nand technological resources to study the problem \r\nglobally and to focus on where and when it is going to \r\noccur so that, through the organization, such places can \r\nbe prepared, with due warning and relief, to adapt to \r\nthe impact. \r\n Leaving the problem to individual nations, \r\nespecially in the developing world, cannot be the way \r\nforward. There should be shared responsibility, even if \r\nvarious solutions are sought. In any case, this menace \r\nmust be tackled on an emergency basis by the \r\nOrganization and all its Member nations, individually \r\nand collectively, for humanity’s survival. \r\n On 6 March 2007, Ghana celebrated the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of its independence as a sovereign nation. \r\nGhanaians were overwhelmed by the incredible level \r\nof goodwill from well-wishers around the world. \r\nPermit me to use this occasion to convey Ghana’s \r\nheartfelt thanks and appreciation to the members of the \r\nAssembly and, indeed, to the rest of the world for the \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 12 \r\n \r\nsingular solidarity displayed to us on that occasion. \r\nMay all the peoples of the world become one and be at \r\npeace with each other. \r\n In line with its independence ideal of freedom of \r\njustice and a jubilant spirit of renewal, Ghana has \r\nrededicated itself to respect for human rights, \r\ndemocracy, good governance and sound economy to \r\nenable its people to develop their full potential for \r\nsustained national development.  \r\n Again, recalling its role in Africa’s liberation \r\nstruggle against colonialism and apartheid, Ghana has \r\nonce more committed itself to working in harmony and \r\nunion with sister African nations and also in \r\npartnership with the global community, as far as it is \r\nfeasible, to end years of impunity, exploitation and bad \r\ngovernance, which have undermined the economic \r\ngrowth and development of the continent. Henceforth, \r\nall energies should be directed at empowering the \r\ncontinent through accountable and transparent \r\ngovernance, economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment to enable it to tackle the myriad problems \r\nthat afflict it and to facilitate its launching into \r\nmainstream globalization. \r\n In July this year, Ghana had the honour of hosting \r\nthe ninth Ordinary Session of the Summit of the \r\nAfrican Union in Accra. The sole agenda of the \r\nSummit was to stage a grand debate in search of a \r\ncontinental union government to accelerate the growth \r\nand development of Africa and its peoples in a \r\nsustained manner. After very frank and fruitful \r\ndeliberations, the Summit firmly resolved to launch \r\ncertain necessary steps towards achieving that laudable \r\nobjective. \r\n To pave the way, the Summit continues to place \r\nhigh priority on the resolution and prevention of \r\nconflicts within and among member nations. The \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council is tasked to \r\ndevelop a robust and dependable security architecture \r\non the continent, including the setting up of an African \r\nstandby force as soon as possible. Those initiatives, \r\nwhich are supported by the international community, \r\nhave already helped to reduce significantly the high \r\nincidence of armed conflicts, which have been common \r\non the continent over the past four decades.  \r\n In line with our concerted efforts to restore peace \r\nand stability in Africa, the prevailing crises in the \r\nDarfur region of the Sudan and in Somalia and the \r\nEthiopia-Eritrea conflict must be resolved. Similarly, \r\nmeasures to consolidate peace in countries that are \r\nemerging from conflict, such as Burundi, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, must be \r\nsubstantially supported by the Organization and the \r\ninternational community to avoid a relapse. \r\n To that end, we commend the efforts of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, whose first annual report \r\n(A/62/137) highlights the challenges associated with \r\npost-conflict reconstruction and development of \r\ncountries such as Sierra Leone and Burundi. As a \r\nmember and a Vice-Chair, Ghana will work diligently \r\nwith other members to achieve the goals of the \r\nCommission.  \r\n We also welcome Security Council resolution \r\n1769 (2007), authorizing the deployment of a hybrid \r\noperation in Darfur, with the consent of the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan, and call for its speedy \r\nimplementation within the agreed time frame. Here, we \r\nacknowledge the tireless joint efforts of the African \r\nUnion and the Security Council, which finally got the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the Darfur warring \r\nfactions to resume dialogue. \r\n We also recognize the special initiative being \r\ntaken by Secretary-General Ban and the Libyan leader, \r\nBrother Muammar Al-Qadhafi, to get the remaining \r\nwarring factions to join the dialogue in order to \r\nachieve full-scale and rounded negotiations.  \r\n Meanwhile, the ongoing peace initiative in \r\nSomalia is proving extremely challenging and well \r\nbeyond the capacity of the African Union alone. We are \r\ntherefore calling for the concerted and timely support \r\nof the United Nations. In that respect, we urge the \r\nOrganization to consider the African Union’s request \r\nfor financial, logistical and technical support towards \r\nthe full and effective deployment of the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM). That will be within \r\nthe letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 1772 \r\n(2007), adopted in August 2007. It will enable Member \r\nStates, such as Ghana, which have pledged to \r\ncontribute troops to do so. A contingency plan for the \r\npossible deployment of a United Nations force to \r\nreplace AMISOM by next February must also be \r\ndeveloped. \r\n Decidedly, Africa is making progress, with \r\nimprovement in the macromanagement of many \r\nAfrican economies. Average gross domestic product \r\ngrowth has increased steadily, from 5.2 per cent in \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n13 07-51578 \r\n \r\n2005 to 5.7 per cent in 2006 to the current 6 per cent, \r\nwhich is expected to be sustained or even exceeded in \r\ncoming years. Africa is therefore more than ready for \r\ngood business. This is evidenced by the increasing \r\ninterest shown by both local and foreign investors. In \r\nthe mean time, the African Union’s agency, New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), is \r\nseriously engaged in studying viable projects that \r\nshould prove strategic to opening up the entire \r\ncontinent and its economy for accelerated \r\ndevelopments. Energy, communications and \r\ninfrastructure development rank highly in this.  \r\n The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is \r\nalso a NEPAD creation. The Mechanism has already \r\nproven helpful in deepening respect for human rights \r\nand democracy, as well as transparent and accountable \r\ngovernance. Indeed, as more countries voluntarily \r\nsubscribe to it, the Mechanism’s real value as a \r\ncreative and ingenious process for addressing many of \r\nthe root causes of conflict is becoming evident. The \r\nGeneral Assembly’s decision to endorse NEPAD as a \r\nframework for cooperation with the African Union is, \r\ntherefore, timely and appreciated.  \r\n There has been a general improvement in the \r\nrelationships between Africa and the various developed \r\nparts of the world and regional blocs. This is reflected \r\nin various initiatives including the Millennium \r\nChallenge Account and the African Growth and \r\nOpportunity Act of the United States of America; the \r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific agreements with the \r\nEuropean Union; the Tokyo International Conference \r\non African Development with Japan; the Forum on \r\nChina-Africa Cooperation; the Indo-Africa Forum for \r\nCooperation and the Africa-Brazil forum, among many \r\nothers.  \r\n Despite this trend, however, there is still a serious \r\ngap in official development assistance. This must be \r\nbridged quickly to enable struggling African nations to \r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. The \r\ndeveloped partners are, therefore, urged to fulfil their \r\npledges.  \r\n On the world trade talks, we urge them to commit \r\nseriously to the aid-for-trade appeal as a critical \r\nprinciple in the Doha Round. Similarly, on the \r\nproposed economic partnership agreement, the \r\nEuropean Union should agree to relax the timeline for \r\nconclusion. They should also agree to review timelines \r\nfor trade barriers and procurement, given that the \r\nrather weak economies of many African, Caribbean and \r\nPacific nations might not be able to withstand the \r\nshocks of implementation in the short to medium term \r\nwithout some adjustment.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s proposal to establish the \r\nOffice for Disarmament Affairs within the Secretariat \r\nto be part of the decision-making process is timely, \r\nowing to the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons and the menace of terrorism. In many places \r\nin the world, these dangers together constitute the real \r\nweapons of mass destruction. Ghana welcomes \r\ninitiatives like the restructuring of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations and the establishment of the \r\nDepartment of Field Support. The latter initiative will \r\nnot only reduce the work of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations but will also help to promote \r\nits efficiency, accountability and transparency.  \r\n The General Assembly’s approval of the overhaul \r\nof the system of administration of justice at the United \r\nNations, for the first time in 60 years is also long \r\noverdue and commendable. However, Ghana urges the \r\nOrganization to reflect also on mechanisms for the \r\nenforcement of the judgments of the International \r\nCourt of Justice.  \r\n Conflicts, particularly those in the developing \r\nworld, have consistently undermined policies to \r\nimprove the circumstances of our peoples. Sustainable \r\ndevelopment can be achieved only in an international \r\nenvironment of peace and security. The United Nations \r\nremains the main and the best multilateral instrument \r\navailable for guaranteeing such an environment and for \r\npromoting fruitful international cooperation, especially \r\nin this era of globalization. All its Member States \r\nshould, therefore, be committed unequivocally to its \r\nideals and purposes.  \r\n To conclude, permit me once again to wish the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Godspeed during \r\nhis tenure and to assure him of Ghana’s continued \r\ncooperation and support.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Ghana for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n The President: May I request that the members \r\nof delegations who are conducting informal bilateral \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 14 \r\n \r\nexchanges in the General Assembly Hall to carry out \r\nsuch contacts outside the Hall in deference of the \r\nspeakers. Please be seated before the next speaker \r\ntakes the floor.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, President \r\nof the Republic of Kazakhstan \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of \r\nKazakhstan.  \r\n Mr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Nazarbayev (spoke in Russian): I want \r\nto invite us all to take a short journey down memory \r\nlane and recall that in 1946 the United Nations General \r\nAssembly, convened for the very first time, by its very \r\nfirst decision established a Committee to deal with the \r\nproblems raised by the discovery of atomic energy. \r\n Almost nothing has happened since that time to \r\nallay the fears of humankind. On the contrary, the race \r\nto possess nuclear weapons, which even terrorist \r\norganizations have now joined, has continued \r\nunabated. Even though the community of nations has \r\nlong recognized the need to reform the international \r\nsecurity system, there has been no real progress. \r\n The lack of an international consensus on the \r\nissue has led to a dramatic weakening of the collective \r\nsecurity system. Speaking in general terms, we are \r\ndealing with a systemic crisis of international \r\ngovernability, and the international community is \r\nrunning out of legitimate levers capable of stopping the \r\nspread of weapons of mass destruction. \r\n Quite apart from any ethical, economic or other \r\nsuch considerations, we need to erect legal barriers to \r\nstop proliferation. For this reason, Kazakhstan \r\nproposes that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) should be adapted to \r\naccommodate the new realities. \r\n It should be acknowledged that the NPT has \r\nbecome an asymmetrical agreement under which \r\nsanctions are applicable only to non-nuclear States. \r\nYet, if nuclear Powers call for the development of \r\nnuclear weapons to be banned, they themselves should \r\nset an example by reducing and renouncing their \r\nnuclear arsenals. That is not the case. This unfairness is \r\nan inducement for those States that still aspire to \r\nacquire weapons of mass destruction. I would only add \r\nthat, to our way of thinking, this aspiration is irrational. \r\n The people of Kazakhstan have lived through all \r\nthe horrors of the effects of nuclear explosions. Four \r\nhundred and fifty-six such explosions were conducted \r\nat the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground. \r\n It was for this reason that the first milestone \r\ndecision taken by Kazakhstan after gaining its \r\nindependence was to shut down the Semipalatinsk \r\nnuclear testing site. That was followed by the \r\nrenunciation of its nuclear missile arsenal, the fourth \r\nlargest in the world, and the dismantling of its \r\ninfrastructure. I want to note here that at that time we \r\nhad not only the trained personnel but also practically \r\nall means for delivery of nuclear warheads. \r\n Those steps have shaped the strategy of our State \r\nin the area of global security. For the first time in \r\nhuman history, a nation possessing destructive force \r\nhas given it up voluntarily. \r\n I am sure that by taking that action Kazakhstan \r\nestablished trust in the world. Thanks to that step, the \r\ncountry has witnessed an inflow of considerable \r\ninvestment that has become the foundation for \r\nimpressive achievements in development known today \r\nthroughout the world. By taking that step, we \r\nconsolidated our independence, having received \r\nsecurity assurances from all nuclear-weapon States. I \r\nhave a question for others: why not follow our \r\nexample, instead of wasting astounding amounts on the \r\narms race? \r\n Over recent years, international terrorism has \r\nsignificantly undermined world security. International \r\ndrug trafficking serves as a financial pillar of terrorism. \r\nToday, the international drug industry accounts for a \r\nthird of the annual volume of the “economy of \r\nterrorism”. It is a well-established fact that terrorism \r\nfinds fertile ground in unstable and poor countries. We \r\nhave such a country in our region, Afghanistan. That \r\ncountry is driving an ever-growing trade in drugs. \r\n Poor countries need the assistance of developed \r\nnations. They need assistance that would give tangible \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n15 07-51578 \r\n \r\nresults. Thanks to a thriving economy, our country, \r\nuntil recently a foreign aid recipient, has joined the \r\ngroup of “new donors”. Over the last few years, \r\nKazakhstan has seen its economy grow at an annual \r\nrate of some 10 per cent. And now we are in a position \r\nto help our neighbours.  \r\n We are concerned with the difficulties in the \r\nprocess of reconstruction of Iraq and the stabilization \r\nof the situation in Afghanistan. The peoples of our \r\nregion, like the entire international community, count \r\non a peaceful solution of the so-called crisis around \r\nIran. The best way to achieve that is for Iran, whose \r\npeople have a great history and culture, to prove the \r\npeaceful character of its nuclear programme. \r\n Today, the peacekeeping efforts of the United \r\nNations remain the most effective instrument for the \r\npeaceful settlement of regional crises. Fifteen years \r\nago, from this rostrum, Kazakhstan put forward an \r\ninitiative related to the enhancement of the \r\nOrganization’s peacekeeping potential. We proposed \r\nthe establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping \r\nfund, with States voluntarily contributing 1 per cent of \r\ntheir military budgets. \r\n That idea has been supported by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has proposed to \r\nredirect 1 per cent of global military spending to \r\ndevelopment. I believe that such a decision would \r\nconstitute an important step towards the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations strategy to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Allow me now to draw the Assembly’s attention \r\nto a number of issues that are important in the context \r\nof Kazakhstan’s cooperation with the United Nations \r\nand its Member States. \r\n First, Kazakhstan welcomes the decision by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to identify problems involving \r\nclimate change as a priority theme of the current \r\nsession. \r\n In this context, I would like to draw attention to \r\nour initiative put forward at the Johannesburg Summit \r\non Sustainable Development, by reiterating our \r\nproposal to establish, within the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations, a register of global environmental \r\nproblems. Such an instrument would help us to develop \r\nmechanisms for addressing environmental disasters. \r\n By the 1990s, the Aral Sea, once a large inland \r\nsea, had lost three fourths of its water. That spelled \r\ndisaster for millions of people living around it. The salt \r\nfrom the exposed seabed is being sprinkled on the \r\nentire Eurasian continent, damaging its environment. \r\nThe countries of the Central Asian region have done \r\nmuch to rehabilitate the sea. However, without \r\nconsolidation of the efforts of the world community, \r\nthis problem cannot be solved. As I did at the 2002 \r\nEarth Summit, I again propose to give to the \r\ninternational fund to save the Aral Sea the status of a \r\nUnited Nations institution. \r\n Secondly, a deepening global energy crisis and \r\nthe growing threat of negative climate changes taking \r\nplace on our planet present acute problems for the \r\nworld community. We share the concern of the leaders \r\nof the Group of Eight (G-8) and Asia-Pacific Economic \r\nCooperation (APEC) countries over these problems. It \r\nis advisable that we develop, within the framework of \r\nthe United Nations, a global energy and environment \r\nstrategy and discuss it at the 2012 World Summit on \r\nSustainable Development. \r\n Thirdly, Kazakhstan forms part of the Caspian \r\nregion, which is playing a growing role in international \r\nenergy markets. As of today, Kazakhstan has the \r\nworld’s seventh largest reserves of oil, the sixth largest \r\nreserves of gas and the second largest deposits of \r\nuranium. \r\n By 2017, Kazakhstan will be among the world’s \r\n10 largest oil producers and exporters. Kazakhstan is \r\nalso increasing its gas production. Possessing large \r\ndeposits of uranium, we will be playing an important \r\nrole in the development of the nuclear energy sector. \r\nThat said, Kazakhstan is fully aware of its share of \r\nresponsibility for ensuring a global energy balance and \r\nsecurity. \r\n To promote further diversification of energy \r\ndelivery to consumers and also to provide assurances \r\nto energy producers, Kazakhstan proposes the adoption \r\nof a Eurasian pact on stability of energy delivery. \r\n Fourthly, the first-ever global United Nations \r\nconference on problems faced by landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, hosted by Kazakhstan in 2003, \r\nadopted an international document, the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. We believe that it will facilitate \r\neffective assistance to that group of countries. \r\nDecisions on the development of regional cooperation \r\nand transport and transit infrastructure adopted at the \r\nlatest session of the Economic and Social Commission \r\nfor Asia and the Pacific, held in Kazakhstan last May, \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 16 \r\n \r\nhave become an important and logical step in the same \r\ndirection. \r\n Fifthly, speaking of Asia, we must mention here \r\nthe issue of the establishment of a continental \r\narrangement for collective security. That has become \r\npossible through the implementation of Kazakhstan’s \r\ninitiative to convene the Conference on Interaction and \r\nConfidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA), \r\nannounced by me from this very podium, during the \r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly in 1992. \r\nToday, the CICA process brings together 18 States, \r\nwhich occupy 90 per cent of Asia’s territory. Their \r\npopulation makes up half of the people living on our \r\nplanet. Time has proven the relevance of the CICA \r\nprocess, within which a political dialogue among Asian \r\nStates is gaining momentum. \r\n Sixthly, we support joint efforts to reform United \r\nNations activities. In our view, the Security Council \r\nshould be enlarged in the categories of both permanent \r\nand non-permanent members and on the basis of \r\nequitable geographical representation and respect for \r\nthe sovereign equality of States. The working methods \r\nof the Security Council should also be reformed in \r\norder to increase its transparency and accountability. \r\nThe General Assembly should play a central role as the \r\nmain deliberative, decision-making and representative \r\nbody of the United Nations. \r\n Most of the sensational predictions of an \r\ninevitable “clash of civilizations,” fortunately, have not \r\nyet been accurate. However, we should be clear that \r\ninterfaith tension feeds the social basis of international \r\nterrorism and religious extremism. I believe that \r\nseeking an accord between religions and the peaceful \r\ncoexistence of ethnic groups is a crucially important \r\nelement in the process of maintaining international \r\nsecurity. \r\n Kazakhstan, a home to 130 ethnic groups \r\nrepresenting 45 religions, has set an example of \r\ntolerance, which has become a decisive factor in efforts \r\nto ensure peace, stability and the economic progress of \r\nKazakhstan. \r\n Conscious of the critical importance of a dialogue \r\nbetween world religions on key issues of the modern \r\nworld order, Kazakhstan hosted, in 2003 and 2006, \r\nforums of leaders of world and traditional religions \r\nwhere religious opinion makers were trying to find not \r\nonly a language of mutual understanding but also \r\nmechanisms for easing interfaith tensions in the \r\nplanet’s hot spots. \r\n I propose that the Third Congress of the Leaders \r\nof World and Traditional Religions, scheduled for \r\n2009, be convened under the auspices of the United \r\nNations. I also propose the proclamation of one of the \r\ncoming years as an international year of convergence \r\nof cultures and religions. \r\n Just days after the terrorist attacks on \r\n11 September 2001, Pope John Paul II visited our \r\ncountry. He said that that tragic event should not \r\nbecome a cause for confrontation between religions. I \r\nstrongly believe that there are no problems in the world \r\nthat cannot be solved if we set harmony, tolerance and \r\nspirituality against animosity, relying on mutual trust \r\nand cooperation. That understanding instils hope and \r\nenhances confidence in the future. \r\n The United Nations plays a special role in the \r\nstrengthening of those hopes. We are not sceptical \r\nabout the legitimacy of international law and have faith \r\nin the effectiveness of such multilateral mechanisms as \r\nthe United Nations in the promotion of security and \r\nfairness. We are against attempts to weaken our \r\nOrganization. Kazakhstan associates itself with those \r\nStates that are willing to strengthen the role and \r\nauthority of the United Nations because they view it as \r\nthe only international body capable of influencing, in \r\nan effective way, the issues of war and peace. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Kazakhstan for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Honduras.  \r\n Mr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, President of the \r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. José Manuel Zelaya \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n17 07-51578 \r\n \r\nRosales, President of the Republic of Honduras, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Zelaya Rosales (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me to express our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has done a laudable \r\njob, thus enhancing the prestige of the United Nations. \r\n I am here on behalf of the people of Honduras, \r\nwho have entrusted to me the torch of Central \r\nAmerican peace so that I can hold high in the \r\nAssembly Hall this light that illuminates understanding \r\namong peoples and nations.  \r\n Honduras is filled with a spirit of hope. Today we \r\nhave the best social and economic indicators of recent \r\ndecades. We have an average economic growth of more \r\nthan 7 per cent. We have very good results in the area \r\nof job creation. We have begun to speed up poverty \r\nreduction by more than 6 per cent in 18 months. We \r\nhave reduced forest fires by 40 per cent, together with \r\nillegal logging and the advance of migratory \r\nagriculture and extensive ranching. We now have a \r\nclimate conducive to public and private enterprise. We \r\nare beginning to strictly implement the transparency \r\nlaw as a civic instrument to provide better access to \r\npublic information. \r\n We have already presented, during the recently \r\nconcluded sixty-first session of this very special forum, \r\nthe Assembly of the people, our demands, our \r\nproposals and a reaffirmation of our values. Most of \r\nthe people of Honduras believe in democracy and \r\nsocial liberalism, and in a free-market economy in its \r\ntrue meaning, as a useful instrument for the equitable \r\ntrade of commodities — the fruits of human labour.  \r\n However, in actual practice — the only possible \r\nmeans of testing our theories — international trade \r\noperates in an unequal and inequitable way, as do the \r\nrelations between powerful and economically weak \r\ncountries. Free trade, so highly touted in all our \r\nspeeches and international propaganda may, if we do \r\nnot redirect it properly, turn into yet another ruse \r\ndisguising unequal relations, the unjust distribution of \r\nadvantages and the undue, invisible code of unfair and \r\ndiscriminatory competition.  \r\n Let us just look at the figures of the World Trade \r\nOrganization, which acknowledge that barely 7 per \r\ncent of international trade goes through free channels \r\nand the free market of economic and transparent rules. \r\nThe rest, that is, more than 90 per cent of global trade, \r\ntakes place outside the scope of the illusory standards \r\nof liberty and justice that we all aspire to.  \r\n We must remedy this situation. Now is the time. \r\nWe must continue to establish the conditions to \r\nimprove international agreements. I acknowledge that \r\nwe are competing in imperfect markets with unequal \r\nrules of the game, which provide advantages and \r\ndisadvantages. Some receive all kinds of subsidies and \r\npreferential tariffs, which transform their products into \r\nprivileged goods. Speculative pricing, dumping, \r\nmonopolies, oligopolies and other discriminatory \r\npractices are promoted, and certain parties are able to \r\nadvance their interests and impose their will on those \r\nof us who are struggling just to reach the threshold of \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n We demand that the rules of true free trade and \r\ncompetition be respected. We do not want to be \r\nrelegated to the basement of history. Our peoples have \r\nthe right to reach the summits of prosperity. \r\n One of the most obvious and classic examples of \r\nthis problem, which is worth mentioning in this \r\nAssembly, is the excessive charges and increased \r\ntariffs imposed by the European market on the bananas \r\nfrom our region. A similar example is the recent \r\nrevision request from the United States that we impose \r\nnew tariffs on products and on the sale of textiles and \r\nfinished fabrics that Honduras exports to the United \r\nStates market. This weakens the spirit of the trade rules \r\nwe signed barely a year ago and would affect \r\nHonduras’ sales to the United States market — a \r\nmarket that investors in our country have gained by \r\ndint of hard work, competing in order to sell at the best \r\nprice and to sell goods of better quality.  \r\n As the Assembly can see, we are not coming here \r\nto ask for the impossible or to demand what is not \r\nowed to us. We simply want to go on record in \r\nexpressing our just and necessary demand for equitable \r\ntreatment in trade relations in the international market. \r\nWe are not asking for sympathy or pious \r\ncondescension. We are asking for respect. We want \r\npeople to pay a proper price for our products and to \r\nvalue our effort and work with the same criterion that \r\nis used to rate the effort of other peoples and other \r\ncommunities that produce goods and services. We \r\ndemand equitable rules and standards. We require the \r\njust treatment that we deserve as authentic and real \r\nmembers of this planet that we all share.  \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 18 \r\n \r\n Likewise, we would like to mention in the \r\nAssembly a problem that almost all of us are \r\nexperiencing. We are suffering the same fate because \r\nof speculative increases in the international markets in \r\nthe price of oil and its derivatives. Barely five years \r\nago, the price of a barrel of oil was about $13; today it \r\nis already above $80 a barrel. It has increased by a \r\ndramatic 600 per cent, thus subjecting our nations to a \r\nstate of greater dependence and international \r\ndestitution.  \r\n The economies of our countries cannot withstand \r\nthis economic blood-letting, which destroys any \r\nattempt for social protection. A large part of what we \r\ncan invest in order to combat illness, ignorance, hunger \r\nand age-old backwardness now drains to the large \r\ntransnational oil corporations. While we are fighting to \r\nreduce poverty and its ills — ills caused by those who \r\nclaim to be free of all blame and responsibility — the \r\nmasters of the world and of trade are increasing prices \r\nto indecent scales as instruments of pressure with the \r\nrise of oil.  \r\n We are appealing to the global conscience to \r\nshare urgent efforts to intervene in the extreme \r\nspeculation in oil prices. We need to establish mutual \r\ncooperation in order to produce forms of alternative \r\nenergy without it becoming a new opportunity to come \r\nup with low- or high-intensity wars that only threaten \r\nthe sovereign rights and the right to strengthen peace \r\nof the democracies of the world. \r\n These are the contrasts of the modern world. \r\nParadoxically, while borders are opening up to \r\nspeculation, abuse and free trade in commodities, they \r\nare closing to people, especially to emigrants. The lack \r\nof ethical limits of a society of unfettered consumption \r\nproduces false expectations among young people in \r\ndeveloping countries. Bombarded by alienating \r\npropaganda, illusions are created that later turn into \r\nurgent economic needs, producing diasporas compelled \r\nby the famous pursuit of the American dream. \r\n There is no better opportunity than this universal \r\nforum to expand on a theme that concerns all of us — \r\ncountries of origin as well as receiving countries. It is \r\nimpossible to measure the drama of the emigrant \r\nexperience, the modern self-exiles that go from place \r\nto place in search of better opportunities. \r\n Honduras, my country, is a multi-ethnic and \r\nmultiracial society and full of immigrants. My country \r\nthroughout its history has been a territory of passage \r\nand a refuge for foreign migrants and a centre which \r\nhas produced its own emigrants looking for a better life \r\nin far-off places. This triple status as a country of \r\norigin, a receiving country and a country of transit is \r\nwhat gives us the moral authority to talk about this \r\ntopic with the necessary correctness and firmness, but \r\nalso with indispensable feeling and solidarity.  \r\n To be an emigrant is not to commit a crime. \r\nMigration has not been and should never be considered \r\na crime or threat, but rather a human right. Migration \r\ndoes not belong to nor should it be included in the \r\nsecurity agenda of any country. That was done only in \r\nthe time of fascism. It should be included and \r\nconsidered within the framework where it really \r\nbelongs, that is, the development agenda of our \r\ncountries. In this way, we would no longer witness the \r\nmonstrous spectacle of inhuman persecution simply \r\nbecause people are migrants, undocumented aliens, \r\npursued and humiliated. Emigration is a right, a simple \r\nand basic human right.  \r\n Those who see the problem of migration simply \r\nfrom the point of view of family remittances or voting \r\nby emigrants abroad are committing a serious and \r\nshort-sighted error. They are wrong to look at the \r\nphenomenon of growing migratory flows in the world \r\nin this way. The problem is complex and difficult. It is \r\nrelated to the economic structure of the country that \r\nproduces emigrants — political problems, natural \r\ndisasters, war, violence, poverty, unemployment. \r\nMigration weakens the social cohesion of the country \r\nthat produces emigrants, facilitates outflows of share \r\ncapital and stimulates the fleeing of manpower at its \r\nmost productive and hard-working stage. It empties \r\ncommunities, impedes the processes of democracy and \r\ngenerates unfavourable conditions because of which \r\nthis wonderful working force is compelled to leave. \r\n Migration is a very complex and contradictory \r\nsocial phenomenon that deserves serious scientific \r\ntreatment, beyond simple emotions and feelings. \r\nImmigrants are people who are simply looking for \r\nbetter market opportunities in order to sell the only \r\nthing they have: their power to work, their energy, and \r\ntheir boundless desire to overcome their poverty and \r\nset out on the road to prosperity and well-being, which \r\nare basic elements of life. They are human beings who \r\ndeserve to be treated as such and to enjoy the basic \r\nrespect that humans should enjoy. They want us to \r\nrecognize their rights and to give them responsibilities, \r\nto value and consider them in what they represent, and \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n19 07-51578 \r\n \r\nto see them for what they are: a productive and mobile \r\nhuman force that is vital and beneficial both to the \r\neconomy that they serve and to the economy of their \r\ncountry of origin. \r\n I propose that we provide a legal basis, a fair and \r\nlegal international framework to ensure that \r\nimmigration becomes an ordered phenomenon \r\nbeneficial to all. I propose that we seek consensus, \r\nreach agreement and establish the necessary \r\ninternational cooperation. Our world needs immigrants \r\nand I implore its representatives, in the name of mercy \r\nand justice, to help stop the shameful persecution of \r\nimmigrants. We must apply the law of family \r\nreunification. It is God’s will that the families of \r\nimmigrants be reunified.  \r\n All of us in Central America, Mexico and Latin \r\nAmerica deeply regret the fact that we have seen no \r\nprogress on the corresponding legislative initiative that \r\nthe President of the United States submitted to the \r\nUnited States Congress. We know that he did so with \r\nthe best of wills, and we therefore believe that \r\nPresident Bush should not falter in promoting that \r\nproposal. The construction of a wall can only separate \r\nus. We must find other mechanisms to resolve the \r\nproblem. Halting the mass deportations and reunifying \r\nfamilies would be a gesture highly appreciated in \r\nnational and international public opinion. We also \r\nrecognize the work of various Governments, in \r\nparticular the efforts of President Rodríguez Zapatero \r\nof Spain, who has reached immigration agreements and \r\nquotas with various countries. \r\n Just as the Kyoto Protocol protects biological life \r\non the planet, the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights guarantee life \r\nand peace in our societies. Let us ensure that they are \r\nimplemented.  \r\n We express solidarity with peoples who are \r\nfighting for their identity, and reaffirm our support for \r\nthe Republic of Taiwan in its efforts to achieve \r\nrecognition in this forum of nations, in its fight for \r\nindependence, and in its constructive and faithful \r\ndedication to the many development processes under \r\nway in Central American countries.  \r\n Central America and Honduras, El Salvador, \r\nGuatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Belize and \r\nthe Dominican Republic are united by the dreams of \r\nFrancisco Morazán, the champion of Central America, \r\na region of leaders in contemporary continental thought \r\nand artists of stature throughout Latin America and the \r\nworld, the belt of the Americas and a bridge to the \r\nworld, in the words of General Omar Torrijos. Through \r\nme, they offer a fraternal and united invitation to visit. \r\nWe have every facility. We have the most beautiful \r\nplaces on the planet, with great potential in such areas \r\nas tourism, bio-energy, telecommunications, \r\nagriculture and the environment. \r\n We cannot remain passive or inactive in the face \r\nof social despair. Our lives are replete with dreams. We \r\nmust, where necessary, overcome the neglect to which \r\nthe developing world is subject. Our great poet and \r\nthinker, Alfonso Guillén Zelaya, said that we certainly \r\ncannot control fate. Prometheus always has to find \r\nsomeone to liberate him if civilization is to move \r\nforward. It is not possible for humankind to come to an \r\nend of its history without first giving the most \r\ndisadvantaged peoples of the world the opportunity to \r\nlive.  \r\n We trust in the future. Humankind knows that \r\nhope is not lost and has full confidence in the \r\nprinciples of the infinite god of love who guides us, \r\nand not in the god of violence, whom we reject. Before \r\nthis Assembly, we express the fervent wish for peace in \r\nthe world, a new dawn for humankind in which \r\neverything would be different and our energies would \r\nfocus on serving human beings and not on trade. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Honduras for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, President of the \r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Emir of the State of Qatar. \r\n Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 20 \r\n \r\n Sheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. I wish you every success in your \r\nmission. I would like also to thank your predecessor, \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for successfully \r\npresiding over the previous session. \r\n I would like further to pay tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who has assumed his post at a \r\ncritical moment in which the Organization is facing \r\nseveral serious challenges that threaten international \r\npeace and security. \r\n The current session has begun at a time when \r\nmore than one fifth of the world’s population of \r\nMuslims are observing mandatory fasting during the \r\nmonth of Ramadan. We were eager to participate in the \r\nactivities of this session being held in this holy month \r\nin order to stress our conviction in the need to \r\ncontribute to promoting coexistence among nations and \r\nto raise an important issue related to the purposes of \r\nthe international community with respect to the future \r\nof peace and progress. \r\n Given its great significance, I would like to refer \r\nto Security Council resolution 1770 (2007), on the \r\nsubject of Iraq, which was adopted on 10 August 2007. \r\nThat resolution has partly restored to the United \r\nNations its rightful role in addressing Iraq’s tragedy, \r\nafter it was proven that it is no longer possible for that \r\nmatter to remain confined to a single State or to a \r\ncoalition of States of converging interests.  \r\n The world’s major conflicts have become far too \r\nbig for a single Power to handle them on its own. \r\nResponsibility for addressing them should therefore be \r\nplaced with the United Nations, as it constitutes the \r\npolitical embodiment of the international community’s \r\nprinciples, laws and broad aspirations to peacebuilding \r\nand to achieving progress on the basis of the rule of \r\nlaw and the will of those upholding its authority. If the \r\nrole of the United Nations is to be more effective, its \r\nstructure must be reformed to adapt to the changes that \r\nhave taken place in the world since the adoption of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, in 1945. \r\n While the current situation in Iraq requires that \r\nthe international community assume its \r\nresponsibilities, the main responsibility remains with \r\nthe leaders of the whole Iraqi people, who are \r\nprimarily responsible for hammering out a formula of \r\nnational reconciliation that ensures justice, peace and \r\nsecurity and preserves the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Iraq. \r\n The international order has witnessed both “cold” \r\nand actual wars. Although real wars are humanly \r\nunacceptable, cold wars are psychologically unbearable \r\nbecause they inevitably lead to proxy conflicts, which \r\nare incompatible with a world in which the forces of \r\nenlightenment and the elements of understanding \r\namong nations and cultures have strived in an \r\nunprecedented manner. \r\n The work of the United Nations in the areas of \r\ndevelopment should be accorded high priority, given \r\nthe close links that exist between development, \r\nsecurity and peace. We were indeed pleased that the \r\nGeneral Assembly approved the initiative of the State \r\nof Qatar to host the first follow-up conference to the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, which is to be held at Doha during the \r\nsecond half of 2008. \r\n One of the major challenges that we all have to \r\naddress pertains to the protection of the environment. \r\nIn addition to the destructive effects of climate change, \r\nthe environment is subject to degradation and \r\npollution, which threaten human life as well as that of \r\nall living creatures. Such a situation requires both our \r\ncooperation and concerted efforts by industrialized and \r\ndeveloping countries alike to find new approaches and \r\nvisions leading to effective short-, mid- and long-term \r\nsolutions. In that connection, I would like to \r\nunderscore my country’s support for any measures \r\naimed at protecting the environment and achieving \r\nsustainable development. \r\n International aid is one of the areas for promoting \r\ninternational partnership. The volume of aid should \r\ntherefore be increased and its efficiency improved by \r\neasing the conditions on which it is granted so as to \r\npromote the national development strategies of \r\nrecipient countries. In that regard, we are concerned \r\nabout the decline in 2006 of the real value of official \r\ndevelopment assistance. Donors should make \r\nadditional efforts to double the assistance provided to \r\nsub-Saharan African countries and to promote the \r\ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations. \r\n Moreover, given the important, major role played \r\nby global trade in financing development, a successful \r\nconclusion to the Doha Round would provide new \r\nopportunities to promote multilateral trade \r\ntransactions. While we are concerned about the \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n21 07-51578 \r\n \r\ndeadlock in the ongoing consultations on the \r\nimplementation of the Doha Development Agenda, we \r\nhope that we will be able to put that phase behind us. \r\nWe also hope that all parties concerned, especially \r\ndeveloped countries, will show the sufficient flexibility \r\nto reach mutually beneficial, practical results. \r\n I have not come to this session to present issues \r\nor crises related to my country or the Arab world, \r\nalthough some of them have reached proportions \r\nconstituting human tragedies. I have come here to raise \r\nbroader issues, as I am convinced that all Arab and \r\nMuslim issues are related to the problems of the world \r\nas a whole. In the light of a global understanding of the \r\nnew phase in international progress — an \r\nunderstanding that emphasizes the belief in the need to \r\nresort to the collective international will, as embodied \r\nby the United Nations, its leadership and system, and \r\nin the set of principles on which the Organization’s \r\nCharter is based — Arab and Muslim causes would not \r\nbe the only ones to benefit from it; it would also \r\nbenefit the entire world. Just causes are always \r\nprotected by the principles of the law, and the law \r\nprovides their true guarantee, as well as powerful \r\nsupport. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Emir of the State of \r\nQatar for the statement he has just made. \r\n His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the \r\nFrench Republic \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the French \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President \r\nof the French Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Sarkozy (spoke in French): To all the \r\npeoples represented here, I convey the brotherly \r\ngreetings of France. Mr. Secretary-General, you have \r\nan enormous responsibility, and you have the trust of \r\nFrance. \r\n This is the first time that I address this Assembly \r\non behalf of France. It is a solemn and moving moment \r\nfor me. I cannot help thinking of all of those men and \r\nwomen who, at one of the most tragic moments in the \r\nhistory of humanity, as the world stood on the brink of \r\nbarbarity, finding that prospect intolerable, succeeded \r\nin countering force and violence and barbarity with \r\njustice and peace. Thus was the United Nations born. \r\n The United Nations is not a mere political \r\nconstruct. It is not a mere legal construct. It is an \r\nawakening of the human conscience against everything \r\nthat threatens to destroy humanity. \r\n I have never believed that the United Nations \r\ncould one day root out the violence that lies within \r\nhuman beings. But what I do know deep down inside \r\nme, what we all know deep down, is that in spite of all \r\nits failures, without the United Nations it would have \r\nbeen impossible to put an end to conflicts that seemed \r\nto be insoluble. Remember the genocide of the \r\nCambodian people, remember the suffering inflicted \r\nupon them; remember the independence of Namibia; \r\nremember the independence of Timor. Look at the \r\nGreat Lakes region, or West Africa. Without the United \r\nNations, the world might have experienced a third \r\nworld war, doubtless even more terrible than the two \r\nprevious ones. \r\n France is convinced that the United Nations is the \r\nonly remedy we have for the blindness and folly that \r\nsometimes take hold of human beings. \r\n The message I wish to bring to you in the name \r\nof France is a simple one: in this world where the fate \r\nof each of us depends on the fate of others, the United \r\nNations should not be weakened; the United Nations \r\nmust be strengthened. Reforming the United Nations so \r\nas to adapt it to the realities of our world is an absolute \r\npriority for France. We cannot afford to wait any \r\nlonger. The world’s problems must be addressed and \r\nresolved globally. No one on this Earth can alone \r\nprotect themselves from the consequences of climate \r\nwarming, the clash of civilizations, major epidemics. \r\nAgainst selfishness, against fanaticism, against hatred, \r\nit is our duty to renew that appeal to the universal \r\nconscience by virtue of which, for the first time in the \r\nhistory of all the peoples of the world, all nations \r\nagreed to meet within a common forum in order to set \r\naside what divides us and talk to one another. \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 22 \r\n \r\n This appeal to the universal conscience is an \r\nappeal for peace. It is an appeal for open-mindedness. \r\nIt is an appeal for diversity. And it is an appeal for \r\njustice. France has always sought greatness for the sake \r\nof men and women, not for its own sake. Like all \r\nnations, France, in the course of its long history, has \r\nmade mistakes, and has sometimes been at fault. But \r\nits people, the people of France, have always chosen to \r\nbe on the side of freedom and democracy. France is \r\nloyal to its friends and to the values it shares with \r\nthem. But this loyalty is not submission. This loyalty is \r\nnot a shackle. And France intends to draw on that \r\nloyalty in the cause of openness to others, of openness \r\nto the world. I want the world to know that France is \r\nwilling to talk to everybody in the world, in every \r\ncontinent. \r\n But I would also like to say that openness is not \r\nrenunciation. Understanding is not weakness. \r\nWeakness and renunciation are not factors of peace; \r\nthey are factors of war. France and Europe in the past \r\nexperienced the tragic consequences of such an attitude \r\nfor themselves and for the whole world. When you are \r\nweak and submissive, you get ready to accept war. We \r\nall have a duty to ensure that that never happens again. \r\nThere will be no peace in the world if the international \r\ncommunity compromises with the right of peoples to \r\nself-determination and if it compromises with human \r\nrights. \r\n There will be no peace in the world unless the \r\ninternational community is unshakeable in its \r\ndetermination to fight terrorism. There will be no peace \r\nin the world unless the international community stands \r\nunited in its resolve to put an end to the wars in the \r\nMiddle East, to put an end to the horror in Darfur, to \r\nthe tragedy of Lebanon or to the humanitarian disaster \r\nin Somalia. And I weigh my words carefully. There \r\nwill be no peace in the world if the international \r\ncommunity falters in the face of the proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons. \r\n Iran is entitled to nuclear power for civilian \r\npurposes. But if we allow Iran to acquire nuclear \r\nweapons, there would be an unacceptable risk to \r\nstability in the region and in the world. I want to say \r\nhere, in the name of France, that we can only resolve \r\nthis crisis by combining firmness with dialogue. It is in \r\nthat spirit that France will act. \r\n I want to say here, in the name of France, that it \r\nis the duty of the international community to confront \r\nthose who seek power and constantly threaten the \r\nfragile balance of peace and to do so by bringing to \r\nbear its unwavering unity and its determination to \r\nuphold the law. I want to say, in the name of France, \r\nthat there will be no peace in the world without respect \r\nfor diversity, without respect for national identities, \r\nwithout respect, I venture to say, for religions and \r\nbeliefs, or without respect for cultures. Attachment to \r\none’s faith, to one’s identity, to one’s language and \r\nculture, and to one’s way of life, thought and belief — \r\nall that is legitimate, and profoundly human. To deny \r\nthat is to sow the seeds of humiliation. It would stoke \r\nthe fires of nationalism, fanaticism and terrorism. We \r\nwill not avert the clash of civilizations by forcing \r\neveryone to think and to believe the same things. \r\nFrance intends to pursue, together with all people of \r\ngoodwill, this battle to build a new world order of the \r\ntwenty-first century. \r\n We want a Lebanon living independently, and we \r\nsay that France will always stand shoulder to shoulder \r\nwith Lebanon in its desire for independence. Tomorrow \r\nwe hope that Israelis and Palestinians will find within \r\nthemselves the strength to live in peace. Peace is \r\npossible. It is possible now. And we will devote all of \r\nour energies to that. \r\n We want to see the peaceful coexistence of the \r\nmain religions to vanquish fundamentalism and \r\nfanaticism. But I want to say, with all due gravity, that \r\nthere is too much injustice in the world for the world to \r\nhope to live in peace. \r\n The founding fathers of the United Nations knew \r\nthat the world’s future could be read in the eyes of a \r\ntortured child; a hungry child; children who watch their \r\nparents being humiliated; children who since birth have \r\nknown nothing but war; children torn from their \r\nhomes, their lands, their families. Because in those \r\nchildren’s desperate eyes there is not only suffering, \r\nbut also all the wars and revolts that will drench the \r\nworld in blood tomorrow. \r\n Let us look at the world as it is. Let us look at \r\nwhat we have made of it. Have we wanted enough to \r\nmake it more just? The answer is no. Have we done \r\nenough to achieve that end? The answer is no.  \r\n When the Berlin wall fell, we all dreamed that \r\nhistory would cease to be tragic. Let us look at our \r\nworld as it is so that we can make it better. Let us \r\njudge our world by the yardstick of justice. Justice \r\nmeans that the Palestinian people can regain a country \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n23 07-51578 \r\n \r\nand build a State. Justice means that the Israeli people \r\ncan enjoy the right to live in security. Justice means \r\nthat the Lebanese people can regain their freedom. \r\nJustice means that the Iraqi people, in all their \r\ndiversity, can find within themselves the path to \r\nreconciliation and democracy. Justice means that a \r\ndeveloping country on which we wish to impose \r\nenvironmental rules, even though its inhabitants have \r\nbarely enough to eat, can be helped to put such rules in \r\nplace. Justice means that we cannot tap a country’s \r\nresources without paying a fair price for them. \r\n Let us look squarely at our world. Never before \r\nhas there been so much easy money, with so much \r\nwealth concentrated in the hands of a few large groups. \r\nThroughout the world, even in the richest countries, \r\nthere are many men and women who no longer have \r\neven a hope of emerging some day from their material \r\nand moral distress.  \r\n In conclusion, I appeal to the conscience of all \r\nthose who have a responsibility for the conduct of \r\nworld affairs. Because if we do nothing, the poor and \r\nthe exploited will one day rise up against the injustice \r\ndone to them. \r\n What the world needs is a new mindset: a \r\ngenuine New Deal on a global scale, an ecological and \r\neconomic New Deal. On behalf of France, I call on all \r\nStates to join together to found the new world order of \r\nthe twenty-first century, predicated on the key idea that \r\nthe common goods of humanity must be the \r\nresponsibility of all of humanity.  \r\n On behalf of France, I solemnly appeal to the \r\nUnited Nations to provide itself, in this era marked by \r\nthe return of scarcity, with the means to guarantee that \r\nall people throughout the world have access to vital \r\nresources: water, energy, food, medicine and \r\nknowledge. I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to \r\nconcern itself with the issue of fairer distribution of \r\nwealth and of the income derived from commodities \r\nand technology. I solemnly appeal to the United \r\nNations to concern itself with the moralization of \r\nfinancial capitalism. I solemnly appeal to the United \r\nNations to go further in combating corruption, which \r\nsaps countries that are suffering and all too poor. \r\n Things must change. Mindsets must change. \r\nBehaviour must change. This is our responsibility now, \r\nbecause tomorrow it will be too late. If we fail to act, \r\nwe will see a resurgence of all the threats that the \r\npeople of the post-war world believed they had \r\novercome. Let us not take this risk lightly.  \r\n Peoples of the world, we can, together, build a \r\nbetter future for all people. It is up to us alone; it is up \r\nto our capacity to remain faithful to the values that \r\nhave brought us together here today. You have \r\nunderstood. France believes that we have no more time \r\nto wait. France calls for action. France urges action. \r\nFrance is committed to action in the service of world \r\npeace. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe French Republic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President \r\nof the Republic of Nicaragua \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Nicaragua. \r\n Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nicaragua, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ortega Saavedra (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): I should like to begin by remembering the \r\nmillions of human beings who are the victims of the \r\npolicies of colonialism and neo-colonialism. Let us \r\nremember the victims of the Holocaust. Let us \r\nremember the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Let \r\nus remember the victims of slavery and apartheid. Let \r\nus remember the victims of the wars of occupation of \r\nViet Nam and Afghanistan, the Dominican Republic, \r\nGrenada, Panama and Nicaragua. Let us remember the \r\nheroic and noble Cuban people, who have suffered all \r\nkinds of aggression and a brutal and inhumane \r\nblockade. Let us remember the five heroes who are \r\nprisoners of the empire because they were fighting \r\nterrorism. Let us remember the victims of the terrorist \r\nattacks on the World Trade Centre and the millions and \r\nmillions of men and women who have been and \r\ncontinue to be victims of the genocide caused by global \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 24 \r\n \r\ncapitalism. Let us remember the victims of \r\ndiscrimination and apartheid at the hands of those who \r\nrefuse to admit into the developed countries, peoples \r\nwho, in Latin America, are attempting to come into the \r\nUnited States, and people in Africa and Asia who are \r\ntrying to go to the European nations. Our thoughts, our \r\nappreciation and our solidarity go to the victims of \r\nnatural disasters, who are at the same time victims of \r\nglobal imperialist capitalism, which, through its \r\ndevelopment-oriented policy continues to bring \r\ndestruction, death and poverty, becoming the greatest \r\naggressor of mother Earth, now destroyed by the \r\navarice of imperialist capitalism. \r\n Let us remember the recent victims of natural \r\noccurrences triggered by these spoliations resulting \r\nfrom imperialist global capitalism: the victims of \r\nHurricane Katrina, the victims of the earthquake in \r\nPeru, the victims of the floods in Africa, the victims \r\namong the indigenous peoples — the Miskito and \r\nMayan peoples — of Hurricane Felix, in Central \r\nAmerica, Latin America and the Caribbean and the \r\nland of Sandino and Rubén Darío. Our brothers and \r\nsisters in the Miskito and Mayan peoples who achieved \r\nautonomy in 1987 and who, today, are part of a process \r\nwhereby their full rights will be recognized, under the \r\nAutonomy Act, have asked me to express their \r\nappreciation to the United Nations because that battle \r\nhas been going on for more than 20 years and now we \r\nare beginning to recognize the rights of indigenous \r\npeoples. They have asked me to circulate here, in the \r\nUnited Nations, a document signed by our brothers, the \r\nleaders of the Miskito and Mayan peoples, \r\nAfrodescendant peoples, victims of Hurricane Felix, so \r\nthat it may be seen by you all, our brothers and sisters \r\nwho represent the peoples of the world. \r\n In the period from 1979 to 1989, I had the \r\nopportunity to speak before the United Nations General \r\nAssembly, and I remember well the speeches and \r\nmessages and positions from that time. Eighteen years \r\nhave gone by, and thanks to the unending struggle of \r\nthe Sandinist people, I am here again today to address \r\nthese words to the Assembly. This morning, when this \r\ngeneral debate began, I listened carefully to the words \r\nof the second speaker, who spoke for exactly \r\n20 minutes — and I myself hope not to exceed \r\n20 minutes — and I cannot find any difference between \r\nthe thoughts, words and actions of those who, at the \r\ntime, were at the helm of that imperialist power, and \r\nthe speech that I heard this morning. \r\n The presidents of the United States change, and \r\nthey may come to office with the best intentions and \r\nmay feel that they are doing good for humanity. But \r\nthey fail to understand that they are no more than the \r\ninstruments of yet another empire among the many \r\nempires that have imposed themselves on our planet, \r\nand they forget that the life of empires is ephemeral. \r\nThey rise, they grow arrogant and mighty and then \r\nbegin to dictate as if they were gods — telling people \r\nwhat is good and bad, determining how they provide \r\nwhat they call assistance — which is no more than \r\npaying back the historical debt they owe to our \r\npeoples. What they are doing is simply responding to \r\nempire, to the politics of Empire and for that reason we \r\nshould not be surprised that not only are we hearing the \r\nsame speeches all over again, but also that we are \r\nseeing the same conditions of oppression and violence \r\nand terror being suffered by humanity. And today, we \r\nare more threatened than we were 18 years ago when I \r\nlast had the opportunity to speak before the United \r\nNations. \r\n Today, under the tyranny of global imperialist \r\ncapitalism, there is an international economic order, of \r\ncourse there is, but who dictates that international \r\neconomic order? It is dictated by a minority of \r\ndictators who impose their interests, the same old \r\ninterests. They are the ones who enslaved Africans and \r\nenslaved and oppressed our indigenous forefathers. \r\nThey are the ones who wiped out the original peoples \r\nof the United States. Then immigrants from Europe \r\ncame over here and unperturbedly — by what right? — \r\nbegan to mix with those people, and to become in turn, \r\nowners of what did not belong to them. They robbed \r\nthe original peoples of their rights and their cultures \r\nand imposed their culture and the interests of the \r\ncolonizers. That is what gave rise to what we call today \r\nthe most exemplary democracy in the world, when \r\nreally, it is a tyranny — the biggest, most \r\noverwhelming dictatorship that has ever existed \r\nthroughout the history of humanity. \r\n I am referring to the tyranny of the United States \r\nempire. If anyone has doubts, let us see how its \r\nPresident spoke to us this morning. He spoke of Cuba \r\nwith a complete lack of respect while representing a \r\nsystem that ordered the assassination of its President, \r\nour dear brother Fidel Castro, whom we had for his \r\nextraordinary solidarity, firmness and principled \r\nconsistency in his struggle for the cause of humankind. \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n25 07-51578 \r\n \r\n They have maintained a brutal blockade against \r\nCuba, while for interests of State, they set aside their \r\nso-called democratic principles when, for economic \r\nreasons, they act together with other nations with \r\nwhich they supposedly have ideological differences: \r\ncapital unites them and ideological differences \r\ndisappear.  \r\n On what authority and by what right does he \r\nquestion the right of the peoples of Iran and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to nuclear \r\ndevelopment for peaceful purposes? And even if they \r\nwanted to use nuclear power for military purposes, on \r\nwhose authority and by what right does the only State \r\nin history to have dropped atomic bombs on innocent \r\npeople, as it did on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, condemn \r\nthe people of Iran, who are working to develop nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes? They have decided that \r\nthis is not for peaceful purposes, but who gave them \r\nthat right? They gave it to themselves, and they are \r\nimposing that on the General Assembly, and the \r\nAssembly is simply a reflection of the realities of a \r\nworld where a capitalist and imperialist minority is \r\nimposing global capitalism and establishing an order to \r\nexploit, repress, impoverish, enslave and impose \r\napartheid against Latin American migrants and against \r\nAfrican migrants in Europe. Global capitalism has only \r\none head, but it has tentacles everywhere.  \r\n On what authority can the country that possesses \r\nthe greatest nuclear arsenal in the world, or any other \r\ncountry possessing nuclear weapons, come here and \r\nseek to question the rights of other countries to the \r\npeaceful development of nuclear energy? What moral \r\nauthority do they have to question the right of any \r\npeople to develop nuclear energy for peaceful or even \r\nfor military purposes?  \r\n Objectively, this is not the best path for \r\nhumankind. The best path for humankind is for nuclear \r\nweapons to disappear altogether. If the United States, \r\nits people and its Presidents — and I do not want to \r\nsingle out any individual President or leader of an \r\nempire; an empire is an empire, and it does not matter \r\nwho is heading the empire, whether they call \r\nthemselves Democrat or Republican — really want to \r\ndemonstrate their commitment to putting an end to the \r\nthreat of nuclear energy being used for military \r\npurposes, then they have to be the first to move \r\ntowards a policy of nuclear disarmament, a policy that \r\nshould encompass all those that possess nuclear \r\nweapons. Then they would have the moral authority to \r\nsay that no people in the world should devote resources \r\nto developing nuclear technology for military purposes. \r\nThen, all nations would have the possibility and the \r\nright to opt for nuclear energy for peaceful purposes — \r\nan option that they would seek to deny to developing \r\npeoples. \r\n Eighteen years ago, from this very rostrum, I \r\nspoke of the Palestinian issue. The Palestinian people \r\nendure an ongoing bloody conflict with a country that \r\npossesses nuclear weapons and that is entrenched in \r\nthe historic territory of the Palestinian people.  \r\n Eighteen years ago we spoke of the people of \r\nPuerto Rico, a nation which is still fighting for its \r\nindependence. The United States continues \r\nunambiguously to pursue its neo-colonial policies, \r\ncombining the most advanced and modern forms of \r\ndomination with the most retrograde forms of \r\ndomination, such as its military base in Guantánamo.  \r\n Eighteen years ago we spoke of armament, and \r\nnothing has changed. Eighteen years ago we spoke of \r\nwar, and today things look much worse because of the \r\nbrutal war imposed by the empire and by its economic \r\nand oil interests. They thought it would be easy to \r\noccupy Iraq and Afghanistan, but they have met with \r\nresistance from those peoples. It was an invasion \r\nlaunched on the basis of a campaign of lies: it was \r\nuncertain that Iraq was in a position to produce nuclear \r\nweapons.  \r\n So what can I conclude? I can conclude that the \r\nenemy is still the same after these 18 years: here I am \r\nagain in the United Nations, and the enemy is still the \r\nsame. \r\n The enemy is called global imperialist capitalism \r\nand it is only we, the people, who can change things. \r\nPeoples that have attained liberation were not given it \r\nby those that enslaved them, but rather thanks to their \r\nown struggle and the blood they shed, for example in \r\nSouth Africa’s independence struggle. How many years \r\nof disgrace, suffering, slavery and apartheid did they \r\nendure in South Africa? That story is true for the whole \r\nof the African continent. Those peoples achieved their \r\nfreedom despite modern colonialists consistently trying \r\nto sustain these forms of occupation. To be sure, they \r\nhave adopted new forms of occupation and domination. \r\n The liberation of our peoples is not guaranteed. \r\nOur peoples must continue to give battle. The unity of \r\nour peoples is the key: the unity of the Latin American \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 26 \r\n \r\npeoples, the Central American peoples and the \r\nCaribbean peoples under the Bolivarian Alternative for \r\nthe Americas (ALBA). They are trying to repeat the \r\nkind of action taken against Venezuela, when a \r\ndemocratically elected president was faced with a \r\nmilitary coup. They are trying to repeat the history of \r\nSalvador Allende, the history of Chile. But the United \r\nNations was not convened to say what barbarity had \r\ntaken place. Yet what had happened in Venezuela \r\nneeded to be condemned, because the Government had \r\nbeen democratically elected. But no: in fact, the \r\nimperialist Power moved immediately to recognize the \r\nleaders of the coup. It was the Venezuelan people who \r\nrose up to return the elected President to his place. \r\nThus, it is the people who decide their own fate.  \r\n Hence, we can all be full of the best intentions \r\nabout changing the United Nations. I do not doubt that \r\neven representatives of countries that espouse global \r\ncapitalism and imperialism come here with the best of \r\nintentions — some of them. But they lose sight of the \r\nfact that they are continuing their handout proposals \r\nand approaches — for these are indeed handouts. When \r\nthey talk about aid, they are insulting us. They have to \r\nunderstand that once and for all. They have profited \r\nfrom the privatization carried out in developing \r\ncountries by the huge multinational corporations. They \r\nsay that they come to help us. What businessman \r\ncomes to help? When a businessman invests, he invests \r\nin order to make the biggest profit he can: not to invest \r\nin the country, but rather to take away, because we \r\ndeveloping countries are considered to be insecure. In \r\nshort, we are the victims of a ransacking. \r\n Compare the volume of the wealth that the \r\ncapitalist and developed countries are currently \r\nextracting from our countries, the developing \r\ncountries, through their big companies and \r\nmultinational corporations with what Latin American \r\nimmigrants send back to their families from the United \r\nStates or what Asian and African immigrants in Europe \r\nsend back to their families: the latter really is a \r\nmiserable amount compared to the volume of wealth \r\nthat is being plundered on a daily basis by these \r\ninstitutionalized forms of oppression.  \r\n However, immigrants working in the United \r\nStates or in Europe work harder than anyone else. They \r\nare doing jobs that neither Europeans nor Americans \r\nwant to do, and for miserable wages. So who is doing \r\nwhom a favour? Indeed, nobody is doing any favours \r\nfor the Latin Americans who find work in the United \r\nStates and who manage to put aside a bit of money so \r\nthey can send $100 or $200 back to their families, \r\ncompared to the plundering by big businesses, which \r\ngo to developing countries not only to reap enormous \r\nprofits, but also to take advantage of cheap labour and \r\nthe conditionalities imposed by free trade agreements. \r\nHuman beings, societies and nations are all clashing \r\nwith free trade, and it remains to be seen who is the \r\nstrongest. Logically, it will be the strongest who \r\nprevail. Free trade is the law of the jungle. \r\n What the world needs is fair trade. What the \r\nworld demands is genuine change in the capitalist, \r\nglobalized, imperialist countries. They have to change \r\ntheir concept of a free market; they have to exchange \r\nthe concept of free trade for that of fair trade and a fair \r\ninternational market. Solving this problem is not a \r\nquestion of reducing subsidies because plainly the \r\ndisparities are so enormous that that is impossible. This \r\nproblem will never be resolved piecemeal but through \r\nprofoundly radical change leading to the \r\ndemocratization of the minority on planet Earth who \r\nown the wealth, own the nuclear weapons, impose their \r\npolicies on the Assembly and go over the heads of the \r\nSecurity Council. They impose their own laws, which \r\nare now solidly entrenched, and they have no respect \r\nfor humanity. It is only by changing the policy within \r\nthose peoples, within those nations, within those \r\nGovernments that we can really obtain the fair world \r\nthat we are all talking about. For we all talk about a \r\njust world. We all talk about a peaceful world. We all \r\ntalk about a world of brotherly love and solidarity. But \r\nthere is a wide gap between words and deeds. \r\n Dear brothers and sisters, please accept the \r\ngreetings of the people of Nicaragua, a fighting people, \r\na people that has suffered interference from the empire \r\nsince 1856 — before the triumph of the October \r\nRevolution, the great Lenin revolution. Before the \r\nEast-West conflict had begun, Nicaragua was already \r\nsuffering from the expansionist policies of empire; \r\nalready we had to take arms to defend ourselves \r\nagainst those who wanted to trample upon us and \r\nimpose Yankee presidents.  \r\n Dear brothers and sisters, we ask you to pass on \r\nto your peoples our belief — our certainty — that \r\ntoday, more than ever, there exist conditions for unity \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean peoples. We \r\nare seeing growing unity among the African peoples. \r\nThe unity of the Asian peoples must grow as well, but \r\nfree from global capitalism. What good is speaking \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n27 07-51578 \r\n \r\nabout socialism if what we are actually building is \r\ncapitalism and if we are just creating a holy alliance \r\nwith global capitalism and imperialism? We have to \r\nbuild this great unity in Africa, in Asia — and in Latin \r\nAmerica, where we are marching with the same \r\nstrength, the same vigour and the same living \r\nprinciples that were those of the African fighters like \r\nLumumba and Sekou Touré; the principles of the Latin \r\nAmerican fighters; the principles of the North \r\nAmerican fighters, the United States fighters; the \r\nprinciples of the European fighters; the principles of \r\nthe Latin America of Bolívar, of Martí, of Sandino, of \r\nTupac Katari, of Tupac Amaru. Those principles still \r\nlive and will live as long as these forms of oppression \r\npersist. \r\n I have faith in God and the certainty that, just as \r\npeoples, despite so much oppression and destruction, \r\nhave not surrendered or sold out, today, more than ever \r\nbefore, peoples should rise up with pride and firmness \r\nand dignity. They are not going to sell out and they are \r\nnot going to surrender to the global capitalist empire. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Nicaragua for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, President of \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Macedonia. \r\n Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Macedonia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n I first give the floor to the representative of \r\nGreece on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Mourikis (Greece): With regard to your \r\nreference to the country of origin of the next speaker, I \r\nwould like to point out the following.  \r\n The Security Council, by its resolution 817 \r\n(1993), has recommended, and the General Assembly, \r\nby its resolution 47/225 of 8 April 1993, has decided \r\nthat that country will be provisionally referred to, for \r\nall purposes within the United Nations, as the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, pending settlement \r\nof the difference that has arisen over the name of this \r\nState. Furthermore, the Security Council, by its \r\nresolution 845 (1993) urged “the parties to continue \r\ntheir efforts under the auspices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to arrive at a speedy settlement of the \r\nremaining issues” (para. 2).  \r\n I would therefore request that the proper name, \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, be used \r\nfor all purposes within the United Nations, pursuant to \r\nthe aforementioned resolutions and in view of the fact \r\nthat there are ongoing negotiations between the two \r\ncountries. \r\n The President: I am fully aware of the fact \r\npointed out in the statement by the representative of \r\nGreece. At the same time, as President of the General \r\nAssembly, I am required to show full respect for the \r\ndignity of every single State Member of the United \r\nNations, including my own.  \r\n I now give the floor to President Branko \r\nCrvenkovski. \r\n President Crvenkovski: It is a privilege and an \r\nhonour for me to address this forum and to share the \r\nviews of the Republic of Macedonia regarding issues \r\nof utmost importance for the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. However, allow me first of all to \r\navail myself of this opportunity to congratulate my \r\nfellow countryman, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, on his election \r\nas President of General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. His nomination to this prestigious position is \r\nyet another proof of the full dedication of the Republic \r\nof Macedonia to the promotion of the aims of this \r\nunique global Organization. \r\n I would also like to congratulate the previous \r\nGeneral Assembly President, Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl Khalifa, for her successful presidency of the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session. Allow me as well to \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on the energetic start of his \r\nmandate and his dedication in this time of great \r\nimportance for our Organization. \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 28 \r\n \r\n The issue of climate change was rightly proposed \r\nby the President of the General Assembly as a topic to \r\nbe discussed during this general debate. The alleviation \r\nof the impact of global warming and climate change, \r\nwhich has become one of the greatest challenges for \r\nindividual countries, but also for the entire \r\ninternational community, calls for the undertaking of \r\ncoordinated and serious measures. It is our obligation \r\nto preserve our planet for the generations to come. \r\nTherefore, one of our imperatives would be to provide \r\nclear political support in responding to the negative \r\nimpact of global warming, while not impeding \r\neconomic growth and the reduction of poverty. In this \r\ncontext, apart from recognizing the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, we should also promote consultations within \r\nthe United Nations environmental institutions. \r\n People around the world expect the United \r\nNations to improve its performance and continue to \r\ndeliver. For many, this Organization remains a symbol \r\nof hope and of support in times of need, but also a \r\nhelping hand in times of crisis. The world has changed, \r\nand so have the challenges. The United Nations must \r\nalso continue to change in order to be ready to respond. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome created a solid \r\nbasis for all necessary reforms. A lot has been \r\nachieved — perhaps not as much as was expected, but \r\nthe progress made so far is visible. We must continue \r\nworking on the reforms of the main bodies, in the \r\ninterest of transparency and effectiveness. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the \r\ncurrent management reform directed towards achieving \r\nefficiency and accountability in the United Nations \r\nsystem. The new bodies are already a reality and fully \r\noperational. What we expect in particular is the Human \r\nRights Council to strengthen its role in the global \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. Driven by \r\nour strong will to contribute to the work of this highly \r\nimportant body, we have put forward our application \r\nfor membership for the period from 2009 to 2012. \r\n The report of the United Nations High-level \r\nPanel on System-wide Coherence offered a number of \r\nvaluable recommendations for the reform of United \r\nNations operational activities. I hope that the \r\ndiscussions during the current session will help to \r\ncreate a consensus on measures to strengthen United \r\nNations capacities in the areas of development, \r\nhumanitarian assistance and environment. \r\n The issue of disarmament, arms control and \r\nnon-proliferation must remain high on our agenda. We \r\nmust therefore attach further importance to these \r\nissues, which are relevant for the achievement of \r\nglobal peace, security and development. \r\n Terrorism continues to threaten our world. The \r\nfight against terrorism is yet another area in which we \r\nmust stand united. The United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and its Plan of Action, adopted last \r\nyear, provide an excellent framework for our individual \r\nand joint actions. We must promote their \r\nimplementation at the national and regional level and \r\nseek to achieve visible results. \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, we reaffirmed our \r\ncommitment to global partnership for development as \r\nstated in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation. We fully agree that every country \r\nbears the responsibility for its own development, which \r\ndepends mainly on national policies and strategies. We \r\nalso agree that global actions are necessary as a \r\nsupport to national efforts.  \r\n Some regions need more shared responsibility \r\nthan others in order to achieve the projected targets. \r\nAfrica, where the situation remains alarming, requires \r\nspecial attention. With this in mind, we endorse the call \r\nfor renewed commitment to the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and we await the \r\nforthcoming High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, which is expected to bring specific \r\nresults. \r\n United Nations involvement in Africa, including \r\nin the Sudan, remains of exceptional importance. The \r\nsituation in Darfur is extremely critical and alarming. \r\nMember States must reunite once again and provide \r\nsupport to United Nations activities in order to respond \r\nto the challenges on the ground. \r\n The Middle East situation continues to be an \r\nissue of utmost concern. People in the Middle East \r\ndeserve to live free from fear and threats. The Republic \r\nof Macedonia supports the efforts of the Quartet and \r\nthe Road Map. A renewed peace process is also of \r\nutmost urgency. The situation in Lebanon also remains \r\nhigh on the international agenda. Recently, the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia joined the United Nations \r\nforces in that area by sending military officers to the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n29 07-51578 \r\n \r\n Since the very beginning, the Republic of \r\nMacedonia has been part of the international anti-\r\nterrorist coalition in Iraq and Afghanistan. The \r\nRepublic of Macedonia fully supports the unity of Iraq. \r\nWe also support the recent Security Council resolution \r\n1770 (2007) regarding an extended role for the \r\nOrganization in Iraq. Building peace and democracy in \r\nthose two countries remains a key challenge both for \r\nthe international community and for the Iraqis and \r\nAfghans themselves. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia continues on its path \r\ntowards a functional multi-ethnic democracy. There are \r\nmany challenges on that path that we should tackle and \r\nobligations that we must fulfil. We are committed to \r\ncomprehensive reforms in all segments of Macedonian \r\nsociety in order to obtain a date for the beginning of \r\npre-accession negotiations for membership in the \r\nEuropean Union in 2008. At the same time, bearing in \r\nmind the successful reforms that we have been \r\nimplementing for years, we are deeply convinced that \r\nit would be realistic to obtain an invitation for \r\nmembership of the Republic of Macedonia in the North \r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) at the next \r\nsummit of that organization, scheduled for April 2008 \r\nin Bucharest. \r\n The region of South-East Europe has come a long \r\nway in the past decade. We are all striving towards the \r\ncommon goal of European and Euro-Atlantic \r\nintegration, which is a strong driving force in terms of \r\nreforms and final stabilization of the region. The \r\nRepublic of Macedonia remains firmly committed to \r\ngood-neighbourly relations and regional cooperation, \r\nand we believe that dialogue is of key importance for \r\nall outstanding issues in the interest of everyone in the \r\nregion. \r\n We continue to support the efforts of the \r\ninternational community regarding the resolution of the \r\nstatus of Kosovo. At this stage, the Republic of \r\nMacedonia hopes that the next round of negotiations \r\nand consultations led by the Troika will bring the \r\npositions of both parties closer. We also endorse the \r\nposition that a resolution of the Kosovo issue should be \r\nformulated within a reasonable time frame, in the best \r\ninterest of stability in the region and the region’s Euro-\r\nAtlantic perspective. \r\n In that context, I would like to underline in \r\nparticular that we do not agree with the recently \r\nmentioned idea of partition of Kosovo according to \r\nethnic lines, since that might have serious negative \r\nimplications for the entire region. The issue of the \r\ntechnical demarcation of our northern border with \r\nKosovo according to a predefined procedure and \r\nagenda remains a top priority for the Republic of \r\nMacedonia. \r\n Allow me to assure the Assembly that we will \r\nspare no efforts translating our words into actions, so \r\nthat people around the world may be convinced of our \r\ncommitment to respecting and implementing the \r\nprinciples and values enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n Finally — with or without any points of order —\r\nthe name of my country is the Republic of Macedonia \r\nand will be the Republic of Macedonia. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly and in my own name, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Macedonia for the \r\nstatement just made.  \r\n Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\nAddress by Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the Republic of \r\nMalawi, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mutharika: I am happy to have this \r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. I convey my congratulations \r\nMr. Kerim on his election as President of the Assembly \r\nat this session. The Malawi Government would like to \r\nassure him of our support in carrying out his duties as \r\nPresident. \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 30 \r\n \r\n I also take this opportunity to thank our hosts, \r\nPresident George W. Bush and the Government and the \r\npeople of the United States of America, for the \r\nhospitality accorded to me and my delegation since our \r\narrival in the state of New York. \r\n I commend the previous President of the \r\nAssembly, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl Khalifa, for the sterling leadership, direction and \r\nguidance she gave in steering the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfirst session. \r\n I wish to focus my address on Malawi’s efforts to \r\nmeet the objectives of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Malawi believes that the MDGs are the \r\ntools for enhancing growth and development and for \r\nimproving the livelihood of people in the poor \r\ncountries of the world. I am pleased to state that my \r\ncountry is making steady progress in the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs. We have adopted the \r\nMalawi Growth and Development Strategy as a home-\r\ngrown overarching national policy for creating new \r\nwealth, for achieving sustainable economic growth and \r\ndevelopment and for combating the poverty that still \r\nengulfs many of our people. \r\n The people of Malawi share a common vision to \r\neliminate poverty in the shortest period possible by \r\ntransforming the country from a predominantly \r\nimporting and consuming to a predominantly \r\nmanufacturing and exporting economy. That, we \r\nbelieve, will enable our country to position itself \r\nwithin the global economy and to compete favourably \r\nin the world markets. \r\n To achieve that vision, we are implementing a \r\nsound system of economic governance in both the \r\npublic and private sectors. That includes fighting \r\ncorruption, reform of the public and private sectors, \r\nsafeguarding human rights and the rule of law, \r\nincreasing social protection for vulnerable groups, and \r\ndeveloping infrastructure for development. My \r\nGovernment has also placed research, science and \r\ntechnology, including information and communications \r\ntechnology, gender empowerment and environmental \r\nprotection, at the top of our development paradigm. \r\n Based on the limitation of our resources, financial \r\nand human alike, we have identified six priorities \r\nwithin priorities that we believe can pull Malawi out of \r\nthe poverty trap. Those include agricultural \r\ndevelopment and food security, irrigation and water \r\ndevelopment, transport and communications \r\ninfrastructure development, energy and power, \r\nintegrated rural development, and management and \r\nprevention of HIV and AIDS. I am pleased to report \r\nthat the Malawi Government began to implement those \r\npriorities in 2004 and that, by 2006, we had achieved a \r\nphenomenal growth rate of 8.5 per cent. We therefore \r\nbelieve that the selection of these top priorities is a \r\ngood one. We are also implementing an effective \r\nsystem of income distribution targeting the rural poor. I \r\ncan therefore boldly say that the Malawi Government \r\nis confident that most of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals will be met or even surpassed by the year 2015. \r\n I now wish to briefly review some of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. For instance, we are \r\ncertain to decrease by half the proportion of the \r\npopulation that suffers from extreme poverty and \r\nhunger, and to improve their nutritional status by the \r\nyear 2015. Malawi has also made significant progress \r\nin the past three years in reducing poverty. In 1998, for \r\ninstance, people living below the poverty line \r\nrepresented 53.9 per cent of the total population. That \r\nnumber was reduced to 45 per cent in 2006.  \r\n For the past two years, Malawi has achieved a \r\nhigh rate of agricultural production and food security. \r\nPresently, Malawi has a food surplus amounting to 1.4 \r\nmillion metric tons over and above our national food \r\nrequirement. We are now able to export food to other \r\ncountries in southern Africa. \r\n Malawi has one of the highest budgetary \r\nallocations to agriculture and food security. We are \r\nempowering smallholder farmers to access essential \r\nfarm inputs, mainly seeds and fertilizer, through a \r\nsubsidy programme. We also support the development \r\nof viable small-, medium- and large-scale irrigation \r\nschemes to reduce dependence on rain-fed agriculture. \r\n The other aspect of the MDGs that Malawi \r\nconsiders critical is the reduction in maternal and child \r\nmortality. Here again, my country has achieved \r\nremarkable progress, largely through the adoption of \r\nthe Essential Health Package as the main strategy for \r\nthe delivery of a cost-effective package of health \r\nservices through a donor-funded sector-wide approach \r\nprogramme. We are also addressing the challenge to \r\nreduce the under-five mortality rate by two thirds by \r\nthe year 2015 and to reduce the maternal mortality \r\nratio by three quarters. \r\n We have identified several highly preventable and \r\ntreatable diseases, such as malaria, pneumonia, \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n31 07-51578 \r\n \r\ndiarrhoea and malnutrition. Malawi is therefore on \r\ntrack towards attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We have reduced the rate of child deaths per \r\n1,000 from 189 live births in 2000 to 133 in 2006. \r\n In the fight against malaria, Malawi has so far \r\ndistributed about 5 million insecticide-treated mosquito \r\nnets to various households. The percentage of pregnant \r\nwomen and children under five sleeping under treated \r\nnets increased from 8 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in \r\n2006. In 2007, we plan to give out 3 million more \r\nmosquito nets with support from the Global Fund and \r\nPresident George Bush’s Malaria Initiative in that area. \r\n One of Malawi’s biggest challenges is the \r\nmanagement and prevention of tuberculosis, whose \r\nprevalence rate is very high, especially with regard to \r\npatients having HIV and AIDS. The Malawi \r\nGovernment has therefore declared tuberculosis to be \r\nan emergency and launched a five-year plan for \r\naddressing the problem. \r\n I am pleased to state that Malawi is one of the \r\nfew African countries that have been successful in \r\nmeeting the challenges of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. \r\nMalawi has also been successful in its public \r\nawareness campaign about the HIV/AIDS epidemic \r\nand its consequences. In 2004, Malawi had 14 \r\nvoluntary counselling and testing centres, and those \r\nhave now been increased to 250. Over 5 million people \r\nwithin Malawi have been tested within a period of less \r\nthan three years. With the support of the Bill Clinton \r\nFoundation, Malawi now has over 130,000 people \r\nreceiving free antiretroviral drugs. Additionally, in the \r\nprevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and \r\nAIDS, we are now reaching over 60 per cent of \r\npregnant women in Malawi. The General Assembly \r\nmay wish to note that the Malawi national HIV and \r\nAIDS and antiretroviral therapy programmes are \r\namong the fastest growing in the world and that the \r\npandemic is showing signs of a decline. \r\n I wish to reiterate the statement I made to this \r\nAssembly in 2006 that we should regard HIV and \r\nAIDS not only as a medical crisis, but also as having \r\neconomic, socio-cultural and political dimensions. That \r\nbeing the case, the solution to the crisis must be \r\ncomprehensive and holistic. I have therefore \r\nestablished a Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS \r\nin my Office as a technical arm in implementing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. I am also pleased to \r\nreport that, from 2004 to date, Malawi has developed a \r\nnational nutrition policy and accompanying documents \r\nas a guide for action. As a result, 350,000 orphans are \r\nnow getting nutrition support. That has reduced the \r\nnegative impacts of malnutrition, HIV and AIDS, such \r\nas absenteeism, and many of those affected now return \r\nto work quickly and are reintegrated into the economy. \r\n The Government of Malawi recognizes that water \r\nis life. We have therefore placed high priority on the \r\ndevelopment of our water resources. We are \r\nrehabilitating water-supply schemes and are \r\nconstructing many earthen dams country-wide to allow \r\nrural communities access to clean water. Currently, \r\nabout 66 per cent of the population has access to safe \r\nand clean water. Malawi is therefore confident that the \r\nMDG on access to water for all will be achieved before \r\n2015. \r\n In the area of universal primary education, the \r\nMDGs have set the target for universal primary \r\neducation for both boys and girls. Malawi has a very \r\nhigh budget allocation for education, science and \r\ntechnology, in order to meet the relevant MDG. To \r\ndate, 60 per cent of Malawi’s children are enrolled in \r\nprimary schools. We are also creating a conductive \r\nteaching and learning environment in order to reduce \r\nabsenteeism, poor performance and drop-out rates. \r\n Malawi is on the right path to achieving the Goal \r\non the management of natural resources and \r\nenvironmental sustainability. We have reviewed our \r\nnatural resources policies, legislation and programmes \r\nto curb the misuse and abuse of natural resources and \r\nto prevent environmental degradation. My Government \r\nis involving rural communities in the management of \r\nsuch existing resources as forestry, as well as in annual \r\nnational tree planting for reforestation and the \r\nprevention of soil erosion and desertification. \r\nFurthermore, the Government is implementing \r\nmanagement programmes for the sequestration of \r\ncarbon, as well as other ecosystem services to \r\nencourage the extensive planting of trees. \r\n In the area of gender equality the MDGs set out \r\nto promote gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen by integrating targeted programmes for women \r\nto enable them to become part of economic growth. \r\nMalawi has a high level of female adult illiteracy, \r\nnamely, 48 per cent — as compared to 24 per cent for \r\nmen. However, girls in Malawi also have a high drop-\r\nout rate from the formal schooling system, as well as \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 32 \r\n \r\nhigh vulnerability to HIV and AIDS infection. We are \r\naddressing those problems. \r\n My Government is also empowering women in \r\nthe political, economic and social areas. In the past \r\nthree years, there have been more women in ministerial \r\nand other management positions than ever before. The \r\nfollowing key positions are now held by women: the \r\nposts of attorney-general, deputy governor of the \r\nReserve Bank of Malawi, five full Cabinet ministers, \r\none deputy minister, chairperson of the human rights \r\ncommission, clerk of Parliament and several \r\nambassadors, principal secretaries and chairpersons of \r\nstatutory corporations. \r\n I would like to conclude by stating that Malawi \r\nhas successfully positioned itself to attain the MDGs. \r\nWe are optimistic that many of those objectives will be \r\nattained. We therefore appeal to the United Nations to \r\nrecognize Malawi’s heroic efforts and assist us to \r\nmaintain the development momentum.  \r\n I would also like to appeal to our development \r\npartners to support Malawi’s policy to manufacture \r\nnew goods and to provide new services to meet the \r\nMDGs. We need support to conduct our own research \r\nand to apply science and technology — including \r\ninformation and communication technology — to \r\ncreate new wealth, to build new capacity and to move \r\nMalawi from poverty to prosperity. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Malawi for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President \r\nof the Republic of Chile \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile. \r\n Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly. I would also like to \r\nreiterate Chile’s support for the new Secretary-General. \r\nChile will participate in all the undertakings of the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n The international community knows about my \r\npeople’s devotion to peace, justice, freedom and \r\nsolidarity. It knows that this country at the southern \r\nedge of the world — despite the size of its economy \r\nand population, as well as its remoteness — has \r\nespoused the great causes of humankind. It knows \r\nabout Chile’s contributions in the areas of poverty, \r\nAIDS, hunger and social cohesion. It knows that we \r\nhave made substantial contributions to the promotion \r\nand observance of human rights. It knows that, even in \r\ndifficult times, we have always supported international \r\nlaw and world peace — with dignity and \r\ndetermination. \r\n Mine is a country that believes in progress and in \r\nthe ability of human beings to be the authors of their \r\nown destiny and to build a better future. The world is \r\nan uncertain place when we are not able to act together. \r\nGlobalization becomes unpredictable when we are not \r\nable to manage it. That is the reason we need to \r\npromote the greatest possible sustainable development \r\nwith greater justice and social equity for all \r\nhumankind. To that end, it is crucial that we craft \r\nagreements and strengthen multilateral institutions, all \r\nthe while making progress in the areas of disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation; that we begin negotiations on \r\nthe reform and expansion of the Security Council; and \r\nthat we make progress in the area of management \r\nreform — on the subject of which Chile, South Africa, \r\nSweden and Thailand have put forth a proposal for the \r\nconsideration of Member States. \r\n The major tasks facing us today will probably \r\nrequire more consensus-building than ever before \r\nknown. How can we ensure once and for all that human \r\nrights are respected throughout the entire world? How \r\ncan we halt climate change on all continents and \r\noceans? How can we make equity and social justice for \r\nall the men and women of the world a concern of all \r\ncountries? Those are the major challenges which we, as \r\nan international community, must today tackle urgently \r\nand with dedication. \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n33 07-51578 \r\n \r\n Chile will vigorously promote universal respect \r\nfor human rights. The establishment of a fairer and \r\nmore humane international order will be possible only \r\nif we place respect for the dignity of the human person \r\nat the heart of the debate. We in Chile will work not \r\nonly to improve our own practices and domestic \r\nlegislation, but also to promote the strengthening of \r\nhuman rights, economic and social development, peace \r\nand security. \r\n As the General Assembly is aware, human rights \r\nhave been at centre of Chile’s recent history. For the \r\ncitizens of my country no place is too remote nor any \r\nsituation too foreign when it comes to protecting \r\nhuman lives and dignity. \r\n We are pleased with the progress made in the area \r\nof norms, both internationally and nationally. We \r\nwelcome the adoption and opening for signature of the \r\nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearance, which fills a \r\ngap in the system for protecting human rights from a \r\ncrime against humanity. Chile signed that instrument \r\nand expects to ratify it in the near future. In addition, \r\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture \r\nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \r\nPunishment is in the process of being approved by our \r\nNational Congress. \r\n The new United Nations Human Rights Council \r\nshould continue to promote a more effective \r\ninternational regime for protection, early warning and \r\npromotion in the area of human rights. We also \r\nstrongly support the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples, which is a very \r\nimportant step in the recognition of the rights of those \r\npeoples. \r\n We shall also work to ensure that democracy and \r\nfreedom are consolidated throughout the world. \r\nDemocracy is a universal value, but it is a process that \r\nmust be supported over time. That is why we will \r\nstrongly support the United Nations Democracy Fund, \r\nso that this aspiration becomes a reality. \r\n We are studying with concern the scientific \r\nevidence showing the devastating effects of climate \r\nchange on our planet. Yesterday we were discussing its \r\nsocial, human and economic effects. We are glad that \r\nthe world is beginning to take notice of this. It is clear \r\nthat there is a serious threat to our future, and we must \r\nact now. \r\n In Chile, for example, we have seen that the \r\nspeed with which the glaciers are melting has doubled \r\nin the past ten years. Our southern zones are, in turn, \r\nexperiencing a dangerous depletion of the ozone layer, \r\njeopardizing the health of our citizens. Although we are \r\nnot the ones mainly responsible for this deterioration, \r\nChile has begun to take the necessary steps to mitigate \r\nthe effects of global warming and to combine efforts so \r\nthat, as a matter of urgency, solutions may be found. \r\n As has been said here many times, there is no \r\ntime to lose. The consensus that we must reach, the \r\neffort to enlist the greatest possible support, is \r\ncomparable only to the international mobilization that \r\nled to the adoption of the San Francisco Charter six \r\ndecades ago. If we do not act now, the future of all \r\nhumanity will be endangered. \r\n Therefore we all have the obligation to construct \r\na new global political consensus to generate collective \r\naction capable of solving the problem in accordance \r\nwith the principle of shared but differentiated \r\nresponsibility and within the framework of the United \r\nNations. All of us must contribute, but especially those \r\nwho have already polluted and achieved development. \r\nWe ask the developed countries to pledge technical and \r\nfinancial assistance to the developing countries that \r\nmost need help with their efforts to combat climate \r\nchange. \r\n We strongly hope that at the meetings of the \r\nParties to the Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and the Kyoto Protocol to be held in December \r\nin Bali, progress will be made in defining the \r\nparameters of a post-2012 process. We also hope that \r\nthe developed countries will make greater \r\ncommitments regarding mitigation, adaptation, \r\ntechnology transfer and financing. \r\n We must, however, realize that the greatest efforts \r\nby the developed countries will not suffice to halt \r\nclimate change. It is also necessary that the developing \r\ncountries take additional emission reduction actions in \r\nthe framework of a global effort within the scope of the \r\nConvention. \r\n I am the bearer of a message of hope as well for \r\nall nations seeking to eradicate poverty and build fairer \r\nand more inclusive societies. We still have a lot to do. \r\nNonetheless, we can say that Chile has moved closer to \r\nbecoming the country that we so deeply desire, \r\nenjoying greater prosperity and greater social justice. \r\nWe are eradicating poverty. In 17 years of democracy, \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 34 \r\n \r\nwe have reduced poverty from 40 to 13.7 per cent. We \r\nhave achieved practically all of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It is an ambitious objective, but \r\none that is justified by our achievements. We are \r\nconstructing a social welfare system that guarantees the \r\nsocial rights of Chilean men and women from the \r\ncradle to old age. We are protecting our children — \r\ngirls and boys, our young people, our mothers and \r\nfathers, grandfathers and grandmothers. \r\n We know that we are not alone in this effort. \r\nPoverty, hunger, extreme inequality and exclusion are \r\nrealities that exist all over the world. With regard to the \r\nfulfilment of the Millennium Goals, progress has been \r\nmade in some regions, but it is not enough. We, \r\ntherefore, join in the commitment to the forthcoming \r\nlaunch of the Global Business Plan for Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals 4 and 5 — that is, to greatly \r\nreduce maternal and child mortality. We do not need \r\nnew commitments; we simply need to fulfil the \r\ncommitments already made. \r\n My country supports the idea of holding an \r\ninternational conference to focus concerted worldwide \r\nefforts on attaining the Millennium Goals, proposed by \r\nthe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, so that the \r\ndream of also globalizing the prosperity that some have \r\nalready achieved can come true in the not too distant \r\nfuture. \r\n We can also emphasize innovative development \r\nfinancing mechanisms for development in order to \r\ncombat inequality and promote social cohesion. \r\n We are on the right track. As the Assembly knows \r\nwell, the Presidents of Brazil, France, Chile, Spain and \r\nGermany, among others, organized an Initiative on \r\nAction Against Hunger and Poverty and their \r\nUNITAID Initiative, through which we have managed \r\nto collect hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the \r\npurchase of drugs to treat AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria; these medicines have been given to hundreds \r\nof thousands of children, mainly in Africa. \r\n But we have to do more. Social equity and the \r\nconstruction of a world with a human face should \r\nbecome a central topic on our global agenda. \r\n The three major causes that I have mentioned can \r\nbe tackled only by common accord of the international \r\ncommunity. Hence, the importance of our commitment \r\nto effective and efficient multilateralism, with the \r\nUnited Nations as its centre of gravity. We are at a \r\ncomplex juncture, but one of great opportunity. What \r\nwe do or fail to do in the next few years will determine \r\nthe future of our descendants. It all depends on us. \r\nNow is the time to act. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Chile for the statement she has just made. \r\n Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. José Socrates, Prime Minister \r\nof the Portuguese Republic  \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Portuguese \r\nRepublic. \r\n  Mr. José Socrates, Prime Minister of the \r\nPortuguese Republic,, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Mr. José Socrates, Prime Minister of the \r\nPortuguese Republic, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of the European Union. \r\n Mr. Socrates (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I have the \r\nhonour to address this General Assembly on behalf of \r\nthe European Union. \r\n I would like to start, Mr. President, by wishing \r\nyou all the best in the mandate you are beginning. I \r\nwould like you to know that you can count on the firm \r\nsupport of the European Union (EU) throughout this \r\nGeneral Assembly, certain that you will continue the \r\nexcellent work of your predecessor, Ms. Haya Al-\r\nKhalifa, whom I would also like to congratulate. \r\n Since this is the first session of the General \r\nAssembly to be convened since our Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, assumed office, I also wish to take \r\nthis opportunity, on behalf of the EU, to renew our \r\nsolid support to him in his leadership of the United \r\nNations. \r\n In this globalized and interdependent world in \r\nwhich we live, only strong multilateral institutions can \r\npromote the fundamental values of peace, democracy, \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n35 07-51578 \r\n \r\nhuman rights and development. This is why the EU \r\nsupports the primacy of the United Nations in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security as the \r\nfoundation and focal point of our shared ambitions and \r\nconcerted efforts. And that is why we adopted effective \r\nmultilateralism and a rules-based international order as \r\nthe objective of the European security strategy. \r\n Let me make this clear: if the new century has \r\ntaught us only one lesson, it is that global challenges \r\nrequire global responses. What is needed is effective \r\nmultilateralism. That is what we are engaged in here at \r\nthe United Nations, and that is what we are seeking to \r\npromote in the United Nations. The message that I \r\nwish to leave with members today, on behalf of the EU, \r\nis that they can rely on us to make effective \r\nmultilateralism a reality, today. \r\n I propose to begin with what is undoubtedly one \r\nof the greatest objectives that we in the United Nations \r\nhave so far set for ourselves, which is to meet the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Those \r\ngoals are demanding, but they should not discourage \r\nus; on the contrary, they should inspire us to accelerate \r\nour work and enhance its effectiveness in eradicating \r\npoverty, building a true partnership for development, \r\npromoting education for all and decent health standards \r\nand combating climate change. \r\n In that context, I must mention one of the stated \r\nobjectives of the European Union: the adoption of a \r\njoint EU-Africa strategy to be endorsed by the second \r\nEU-Africa summit, to be held in Lisbon in December. I \r\nmention that objective because it is a clear sign of our \r\ntimes: a strategy, defined jointly by Africans and \r\nEuropeans, that reflects our commitment to the MDGs \r\nand is in keeping with the activities of both continents’ \r\nmultilateral institutions. It is an inclusive and \r\nambitious strategy that reflects the progress made in \r\nEuro-African cooperation in a broad range of areas and \r\nsets standards to be met through shared responses to \r\nthe challenges likewise shared by the continents of \r\nAfrica and Europe. \r\n Climate change is one of the great global \r\nchallenges facing humanity today. It threatens our \r\nprosperity and could undermine our ability to achieve \r\nthe MDGs. Here, too, our response must be global and \r\ncollective.  \r\n I was pleased to take part in the high-level event \r\non climate change. Its results are encouraging and give \r\nrise to optimism. They clearly show a political will to \r\nmove forward. Sustainable development and emission \r\nreductions must go hand in hand; therefore, they are \r\nour shared responsibility. This initiative will add \r\nmomentum to the formulation of a post-2012 global \r\ncomprehensive agreement on a climate regime. I \r\nbelieve that we should agree to begin negotiations on \r\nsuch a regime at the Bali climate change conference, to \r\nbe held in December. I wish to make it absolutely clear \r\nthat the EU will make every effort to achieve an \r\nambitious and solid international consensus at the \r\nconference. \r\n Even more important, however, we need \r\neveryone’s support. The EU has already unilaterally \r\ncommitted itself to cutting its greenhouse gas \r\nemissions by at least 20 per cent. But we want to go \r\nfurther, and we are prepared to do so. That is why we \r\nannounced that, as part of a future global agreement on \r\nclimate rules, we would increase that commitment to \r\n30 per cent. Here, I would like to reiterate our call for \r\nglobal emissions to be reduced by at least 50 per cent \r\nof their 1990 levels by 2050. I believe that by \r\nundertaking those commitments, the EU is sending a \r\nclear signal that it wishes to lead these global efforts. \r\n I also wish to say something about reform of the \r\ninstitutional framework for United Nations \r\nenvironmental efforts. The EU firmly believes that \r\nambitious reform is required if we are to achieve real \r\nchange. In that context, the EU is in favour of \r\ntransforming the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme into a specialized agency — a United \r\nNations Environment Organization — because we \r\nbelieve it is essential to take heed of international \r\npublic opinion.  \r\n Sustainable development also involves \r\nrespecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights \r\nthroughout the world. We believe that that is crucial \r\nand that it must remain at the centre of all United \r\nNations sectoral activities. The General Assembly’s \r\nThird Committee should continue to play a central role \r\nin promoting and protecting human rights throughout \r\nthe world. At the present session, the EU will do its \r\nutmost, as it has in the past, to ensure the Committee’s \r\nsuccess.  \r\n Here, I should like to say to the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly that the EU is following closely the \r\nsituation in Myanmar. We express our solidarity with \r\nthe people of that country and call on its authorities to \r\nA/62/PV.4 \r\n \r\n07-51578 36 \r\n \r\nrespect human rights. In particular, we call on them to \r\nrefrain from using any form of violence against people \r\nwho are engaged in peaceful protest. The authorities \r\nmust endeavour to promote a genuine process of \r\npolitical reconciliation, because that is what democracy \r\nand respect for human rights require.  \r\n I wish to reaffirm the EU’s long-standing \r\nopposition to the death penalty and to reiterate once \r\nagain our appeal for its total abolition throughout the \r\nworld. In that regard, the EU will, together with \r\ncountries from every region of the world, formulate a \r\ndraft resolution on a universal moratorium on, and \r\nabolition of, the death penalty. \r\n Effective multilateralism also requires a \r\nconcerted response to the ever-widening range of \r\nthreats to international peace and security.  \r\n We welcome the establishment of the African \r\nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur so \r\nthat we can jointly contribute to the political resolution \r\nof that conflict, which has had tragic humanitarian \r\nconsequences in the Sudan and the entire region. In \r\norder to address those consequences, the European \r\nUnion reaffirms its support for the deployment of a \r\nmultidimensional presence in eastern Chad and the \r\nnorthern Central African Republic and welcomes the \r\nopening of political talks on Darfur, which will take \r\nplace in Libya on 27 October. \r\n But peace and security are also a challenge in \r\nEurope. We share the opinion of the Secretary-General \r\nthat the status quo in Kosovo is not sustainable. For \r\nthat reason, the European Union supports and \r\nparticipates actively in the ongoing efforts of the \r\ninternational community, namely those of the Troika, \r\nto bring the parties closer together and obtain a \r\ncomprehensive political solution that will lead to a \r\ndemocratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo and will \r\ncontribute to the consolidation of stability and \r\nprosperity in that part of Europe: the Balkans. We urge \r\nboth parties to engage constructively and creatively in \r\nthat process. The European Union stands ready to play \r\na significant role in the implementation of a future \r\nstatus settlement at the end of the negotiations. \r\n The reactivation of the Middle East peace process \r\nremains a priority for the international community. We \r\nhave to act quickly, because the door is open at the \r\nmoment, but it will not stay open for long. The \r\nEuropean Union, as a member of the Quartet, reiterates \r\nits commitment to reaching a just, comprehensive and \r\nlasting solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict. That can \r\nhappen only through the creation of an independent, \r\ndemocratic and viable Palestinian State living side by \r\nside with Israel in peace and security. \r\n The stabilization of Lebanon will also contribute \r\nto the stabilization of the Middle East. Resolving the \r\npresent political crisis requires a special commitment \r\nand dialogue by Lebanon’s leaders and the countries of \r\nthe region. For its part, the European Union is \r\ncommitted to ensuring Lebanon’s sovereignty, \r\nindependence, unity and territorial integrity. \r\n In the same manner, the European Union \r\ncontinues to support the promotion of peace, stability \r\nand prosperity in Afghanistan and the wider region.  \r\n All terrorist acts are criminal and unjustifiable, \r\nregardless of their motivation, their form or their \r\nmanifestation. We must therefore make resolute efforts \r\nto counter terrorism, but that must be done in \r\naccordance with our obligations under international \r\nlaw, while fully respecting human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, the protection of which are \r\nessential in tackling the threat of terrorism. \r\n I wish to say a word, from the standpoint of \r\nEurope, about the Alliance of Civilizations. It is an \r\nimportant and timely initiative that seeks to strengthen \r\ndialogue among peoples, cultures and religions. The \r\nEuropean Union supports the appointment of former \r\nPortuguese President Jorge Sampaio to the post of \r\nHigh Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nand welcomes his action plan. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to acknowledge the commitment of the \r\nGroup of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations, for \r\nwhich we ask for everyone’s support. \r\n For centuries, international trade has been the \r\nmain means of bringing different cultures and peoples \r\ntogether. That is why we also call for the earliest \r\npossible agreement in the World Trade Organization’s \r\nDoha Development Round. This month will be \r\nabsolutely crucial for the Doha Development Agenda. \r\nTherefore, it is vital for all key members to show a \r\nspirit of compromise and constructiveness and the \r\ngenuine will to commit to a fair and balanced \r\nagreement that can bring greater wealth for all. \r\n Peace must be consolidated; failing this, it can be \r\nno more than the interval between wars. One of the \r\nnewest Members of the United Nations is an example \r\nof that. I am referring to Timor-Leste, which, thanks to \r\n A/62/PV.4\r\n \r\n37 07-51578 \r\n \r\nthe efforts and commitment of the international \r\ncommunity to consolidate the foundations of its \r\nstatehood, its democracy and its development, recently \r\nsuccessfully held its first independently organized \r\nelections. But, notwithstanding that success — which \r\nis enormous — the presence of all players continues to \r\nbe required, to ensure the country’s political, economic \r\nand social stability. \r\n We believe and wish to make it clear, here, \r\nbeyond all doubt that the only possible response to the \r\nchallenges of our times lies in effective multilateralism \r\nbased on the United Nations system. For that reason we \r\nremain committed to the reform of its main bodies in \r\norder to enhance the Organization’s representivity, \r\ntransparency and effectiveness. \r\n Political will is needed in order to adapt our \r\ninternational system to the challenges we face today. \r\nThe General Assembly and the Secretary-General can  \r\n \r\nrely on the European Union to help turn that political \r\nwill into action. The response to those challenges lies \r\nin active and effective multilateralism. For all of us, it \r\nlies in the United Nations and in support for the \r\nOrganization.
