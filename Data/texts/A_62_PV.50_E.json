(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 9 and 122 (continued)  \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/62/2)  \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters  \r\n \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of my delegation, Mr. President, I thank you for \r\nconvening this meeting to consider the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/2). I am grateful to the \r\nPresident of the Council for presenting it. I also thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his notification pursuant to \r\nparagraph 2 of Article 12 of the Charter (A/62/300). \r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Angola on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States.  \r\n Reading the report makes us aware of the many \r\nchallenges that the Council faced during the period \r\nunder review. Outstanding progress has been made in \r\nmanaging such issues, thanks to the Council’s \r\ncommitment and firmness. Nevertheless, a great deal \r\nremains to be done in order to restrain the serious \r\nthreats to international peace and security.  \r\n In the area of peacekeeping, Africa continues to \r\ntake up a considerable proportion of the Council’s \r\nagenda. We welcome the synergy that has been \r\nestablished between the Security Council and the \r\nAfrican Union, which has enabled the two bodies to \r\ncooperate and gradually integrate the peace and security \r\narchitecture of the African Union into the system of \r\ncollective security established by the Charter.  \r\n Implementation of the Ten-Year Capacity-\r\nBuilding Programme to strengthen the capacities of the \r\nAfrican Union will help the efforts to bring long-term \r\nstability to the continent. We urge the Security Council \r\nto continue to promote the Programme and to improve \r\ncoordination of its activities in Africa with the African \r\nUnion Peace and Security Council. We hope that the \r\nforthcoming report of the Secretary-General on \r\nrelations between the United Nations and the African \r\nUnion will contain concrete recommendations on \r\nimproving the structure of cooperation.  \r\n We welcome the Security Council’s efforts to \r\nstrengthen its actions to prevent the outbreak of new \r\ncrises threatening international peace and security. The \r\nCouncil should establish an institutional framework to \r\nmake its efforts more systematic and effective, as is \r\ncurrently the case with regard to preventing the \r\nresurgence of conflict by promoting peacebuilding in \r\nthe framework of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nestablished in December 2005.  \r\n We welcome the practice of Security Council \r\nvisits to the countries on its agenda, in particular to \r\nAfrican countries as well as to the headquarters of the \r\nAfrican Union. This makes it possible to intensify \r\nconsultations with the parties involved, particularly \r\nwith the Peace and Security Council of the African \r\nUnion, as well as to harmonize options and approaches \r\nto joint solutions in order to overcome the problems \r\nidentified.  \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 2 \r\n \r\n In this connection, the decision to deploy a hybrid \r\nmission to Darfur marks a significant evolution in \r\ncooperation and a better division of labour. We also \r\nwelcome the efforts to improve the prospects of a \r\nlasting peace in West Africa. The Council’s report \r\nemphasizes that, in spite of the grave concerns caused \r\nby the proliferation of light weapons, the situation \r\nappears more promising than it has been for some years.  \r\n The considerable efforts to promote international \r\njustice and combat impunity for crimes connected with \r\nmassive violations of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law must be continued. The Council \r\nshould consolidate the achievements made in this \r\nregard, so that the implementation of completion \r\nstrategies does not call into question the possibility of \r\nprosecuting fugitives, which is essential to the \r\npreservation of peace in the countries concerned.  \r\n The Council should also ensure that the \r\njurisprudence of the international criminal tribunals is \r\naccessible to those countries at all times. The African \r\nUnion must also be considered as a possible \r\ndestination for the records of the proceedings of the \r\ntribunals operating in Africa. In this respect, there \r\nshould be cooperation with the African Court on \r\nHuman and Peoples’ Rights.  \r\n It is noteworthy that the Security Council has \r\nconducted a fruitful dialogue with Member States on \r\ngeneral issues pertaining to international peace and \r\nsecurity, especially through public and thematic \r\ndebates. The views expressed by States in that dialogue \r\nshould be taken into account so that this extremely \r\nvaluable exercise of thematic debates may give rise to \r\na constant momentum, strengthening the effectiveness \r\nof the Council’s action.  \r\n The fact remains that the Security Council in its \r\ncurrent configuration has inconsistencies that affect its \r\ncapacity for action. We hope that steps will be taken \r\nduring the current session to carry out the long awaited \r\nreform of the Council. My delegation looks forward to \r\nthis reform, which should affect the two categories of \r\nseats on the Council and its working methods. Our \r\nviews are well known on the bold steps needed to \r\nenhance the Council’s representativity, and thus its \r\nlegitimacy and authority.  \r\n In general, we should take advantage of the \r\nsignificant progress achieved during the course of the \r\nsixty-first session, which should serve as the basis for \r\ndetermining the parameters of the Council’s new \r\nconfiguration so that it can respond to the new \r\ngeopolitical realities of the 21st century. This new \r\nconfiguration should take into consideration the need to \r\ncorrect the historic injustice done to Africa by its \r\nexclusion from the permanent seats on the Security \r\nCouncil. We repeat the legitimate claim of the African \r\ncontinent to two permanent seats and five \r\nnon-permanent seats to provide equitable representation \r\nof all of its subregions, in accordance with the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the 2005 Syrte Declaration. Reform \r\nmust ensure an equitable representation of developing \r\ncountries, as well as a geographical distribution of \r\nseats, taking into account the numeric weight of each \r\nregion within the Organization.  \r\n In the same vein, we should firmly commit to \r\nreform of the Council’s working methods to clearly \r\ntake into account and express the sovereign equality of \r\nMember States and other cardinal principles of the \r\nCharter. The consideration that the Council has begun \r\non this matter deserves to be pursued, taking into \r\naccount Member States’ specific proposals, and in \r\nparticular those of the “S-5” group, which my \r\ndelegation supports.  \r\n At the end of the sixty-first session, \r\nMr. President, under the visionary leadership of your \r\npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa — to \r\nwhom I pay tribute — the General Assembly gave a \r\nclear mandate on the next stage of Security Council \r\nreform. As you so well emphasized in your statement at \r\nthe beginning of the current session, we must have the \r\ncourage to begin the next phase, which should lead to \r\nconcrete results. The next phase of which you spoke is \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to provide the United \r\nNations and the international community with a \r\nSecurity Council that is more representative in its \r\ncomposition, more transparent, more inclusive in its \r\nworking methods, and thus more effective in dealing \r\nwith threats to international peace and security.  \r\n We count on you, Mr. President, to conduct the \r\nnegotiations, and encourage you to appoint one or two \r\ncoordinators to help you in that very delicate exercise. \r\nBefore the end of this session we should — working \r\nmodestly, calmly and with determination — reach \r\nagreement on the substance of a bold reform meeting \r\nthe expectations of the international community and \r\nthe peoples of the United Nations, especially in the \r\ntwenty-first century.  \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n3 07-59704 \r\n \r\n Mr. De Palacio España (Spain): The Spanish \r\ndelegation appreciates the opportunity of this joint \r\ndebate to express its views about Security Council \r\nreform in all its aspects.  \r\n The last session of the General Assembly \r\nwitnessed unusual and particularly fruitful activity \r\nconcerning consideration of equitable representation on \r\nthe Security Council, increase in its membership and \r\nother issues relating to the Security Council.  \r\n To a large extent, that activity was due to the \r\nleadership of the former President of the General \r\nAssembly and, through her mandate, to the work done \r\nby the group of five facilitators — the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Cyprus, Croatia, Chile, the \r\nNetherlands and Tunisia — as well as the work done \r\nlater, under a new presidential mandate, by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Chile and Liechtenstein, \r\nbuilding on the work of the former group.  \r\n If one had to single out one proposal that \r\nembodied the spirit of the conclusions reached in those \r\nreports, the most significant would undoubtedly be the \r\nproposal that the General Assembly should choose a \r\nformula for Security Council reform that could win the \r\ngreatest possible political acceptance among Members, \r\nand in any case a level well above the majority \r\nstipulated by the Charter.  \r\n As a result of our work at the end of the previous \r\nsession, the Assembly decided to continue, at the \r\ncurrent session, to examine the question now before us, \r\nin order to achieve further concrete steps, including \r\nthrough intergovernmental negotiations, building on \r\nthe progress made so far. In a striking step forward, it \r\nalso urged the Open-ended Working Group to exert \r\nefforts to achieve general agreement among Member \r\nStates in the consideration of all topics related to this \r\nquestion. This decision was ratified by the General \r\nAssembly in plenary session. \r\n My delegation, together with the other \r\ndelegations that form the Uniting for Consensus group, \r\nconsiders that the new phase of negotiation to be \r\nstarted under your leadership, Mr. President, should \r\nuse the framework provided by the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group. We can all be represented there and \r\nmake known our positions in a fair and open fashion, \r\nbuilding on the results achieved so far, particularly in \r\nthe previous session. We can do so with a view to \r\nreaching general agreement, ruling out alternatives that \r\nwould promote voting on exclusive and partisan \r\npositions reflective of interests that we believe are not \r\nthe general interests of the Assembly.  \r\n The dialogue begun in recent months, resulting in \r\nthe recommendation of the Working Group and the \r\nAssembly decision that I referred to previously, is the \r\nonly way in which to resolve the question of Security \r\nCouncil reform in a manner that can pave the way for \r\ngenuine negotiations, with an in-depth exploration of \r\nformulas that will make it possible to reach general \r\nagreement, as regards both the composition of the \r\nSecurity Council and the reform of its working \r\nmethods. We believe that the two aspects should be \r\nconsidered jointly, with a view to finding a solution.  \r\n My delegation believes that the two reports \r\nresulting from the work at the last session should be \r\nconsidered together as a useful tool in order to begin a \r\nnegotiating process, as noted in the letter of the former \r\nPresident of the General Assembly of 26 June. \r\nTogether with a significant number of other \r\ndelegations, we have been supporting the proposed \r\napproach that we should first seek a provisional \r\nagreement, subject to revision, known as the \r\n“intermediary approach”, in order to secure the \r\nbroadest possible support for reform and thus increase \r\nthe probability of being implemented and being \r\neffective.  \r\n At the current session, the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup should undertake consultations for the necessary \r\ndrawing up of the framework, format and modalities of \r\nnegotiations, in order to better prepare for a proper \r\nnegotiating phase. Without wishing to set artificial and \r\nunrealistic deadlines, we hope that that phase will \r\nbegin soon.  \r\n Mr. President, my delegation has complete \r\nconfidence in your capacity and determination to push \r\nforward the work of preparing this negotiating ground. \r\nThe preparation should be carried out in transparent \r\nand open consultations with the relevant groups, \r\nalready known, without intermediaries, since the task \r\nof defining the alternatives and proposals has already \r\nbeen done and is well known.  \r\n We believe that this is not the moment to present \r\nunilateral initiatives. Instead, we should work together \r\nunder the same leadership, without prejudice to our \r\nrespective positions, with the shared objective of \r\nachieving viable reform. We therefore consider that it is \r\nnot appropriate for us to give you a new mandate, \r\nbeyond the one that you already have, Mr. President, \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 4 \r\n \r\nmuch less fix terms of reference, however general, in \r\norder to begin the work that we must now all undertake, \r\nsince that would be neither necessary nor desirable.  \r\n Mr. President, you may rely on the support of my \r\ndelegation in initiating the measures you consider \r\nnecessary within the framework that we have indicated. \r\nMy delegation — together with, I am sure, all the \r\ndelegations working together for consensus — is fully \r\ncommitted to the ultimate goal of continuing to work \r\nhonestly and seriously, with an open mind, for a \r\nnegotiated proposal that will lead to general agreement \r\non Security Council reform.  \r\n Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea): At the outset, we \r\nthank the Permanent Representative of Indonesia for \r\nintroducing the report on the activities of the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 1 August 2006 to 31 July 2007 \r\n(A/62/2).  \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome document \r\n(resolution 60/1) reflected, amongst many other \r\nimportant issues, the resolve of world leaders to \r\nsupport the reform of the Security Council. That \r\nreform is considered an essential element of the overall \r\nreform efforts of the United Nations. Additionally, and \r\nindeed critically, the reform of the Security Council \r\nwould make it more broadly representative, efficient \r\nand transparent, and would further enhance its \r\neffectiveness and legitimacy in the implementation of \r\nits decisions globally.  \r\n We commend you, Mr. President, for your strong \r\nleadership in translating the resolve of world leaders in \r\nyour five stated priorities of climate change, financing \r\nfor development, the Millennium Development Goals, \r\ncountering terrorism, and, lastly and importantly, \r\nrenewing the management, effectiveness and coherence \r\nof this Organization, which includes Security Council \r\nreform.  \r\n In order to facilitate a fair, effective and \r\ntransparent process, an intergovernmental negotiating \r\nprocess must be initiated immediately. Such a process \r\ncould be determined through an objective and \r\ntransparent method, such as a questionnaire or straw \r\npoll, to arrive at a set of elements that could command \r\nthe widest support, so that they can serve as the basis \r\nfor such intergovernmental negotiations.  \r\n In this regard, we propose that the following \r\nelements be included: first, expansion in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories; secondly, \r\ngreater representation for the developing countries, \r\nincluding better access for island and small States; \r\nthirdly, representation for the developed countries and \r\nthose with transition economies, reflective of \r\ncontemporary world realities; fourthly, comprehensive \r\nimprovement in the Council’s working methods — \r\nhere we acknowledge the work of the S-5 group; \r\nfifthly, equitable geographical distribution; lastly, \r\nprovision for review.  \r\n We also believe that there must be a review \r\nmechanism on a periodical basis so that you, \r\nMr. President, and future Presidents of the Assembly can \r\ninform Member States of progress in achieving concrete \r\nresults on the comprehensive reform of the Council.  \r\n Sixty years after the founding of the United \r\nNations, the Security Council no longer reflects current \r\npolitical realities. Despite a nearly fourfold increase in \r\nthe membership of the United Nations since the \r\nOrganization was established, the size and composition \r\nof the Security Council, particularly its permanent \r\nmembership, has remained intact.  \r\n Any reform process must advance the core \r\ninterests of the vast majority of Member States. Any \r\nexpansion of the Security Council needs to be in both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories, with \r\nrepresentation given in both categories to developing \r\ncountries from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean.  \r\n To conclude, the discussions on this issue have \r\ncontinued unabated for over a decade. Unless there is \r\nan intergovernmental process, the discussions will \r\nremain just that.  \r\n Mr. President, we support you, and we look \r\nforward to your strong leadership in this instance.  \r\n Mr. Soborun (Mauritius): Mr. President, I join \r\ncolleagues in thanking you for convening this timely \r\nmeeting on agenda item 9, report of the Security \r\nCouncil, and agenda item 122, question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters.  \r\n I start by associating myself with the statement \r\nmade by Mr. Gaspar Martins, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Angola, on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. I also commend Mr. Marty Natalegawa, \r\nPermanent Representative of Indonesia, for his very \r\nsuccinct and lucid presentation of the annual report of \r\nthe Security Council.  \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n5 07-59704 \r\n \r\n With regard to the report, I shall limit myself to a \r\nfew comments.  \r\n My delegation believes that by simply presenting \r\nits activities in chronological order the Council does \r\nnot fully live up to its mandate. It would be more \r\nhelpful if the following steps were taken.  \r\n The report could be more analytical, giving an \r\nassessment of the actions and decisions taken. The \r\nCouncil could hold an open session to discuss its report \r\nin depth, so as to enlighten Member States on its actions \r\nand its decision-making process, as most decisions are \r\nthrashed out and finalized in closed consultations. The \r\nCouncil could submit to the Assembly a quarterly or \r\nsemi-annual report, or a special report, so that the \r\nAssembly could hold periodic meetings on the Council’s \r\nactivities during the course of the year. That would no \r\ndoubt enhance the transparency, accountability and \r\neffectiveness of the Council.  \r\n There could also be periodic interaction and \r\ncoordination between the Council, the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, with a \r\nview to enhancing coherence and avoiding any \r\nencroachment on each other’s mandates.  \r\n Notwithstanding the points I have just made, I \r\ncommend the Council for its efforts in striving for \r\npeace and security, particularly in the countries in \r\nconflict situations in Africa.  \r\n I approach agenda item 122 from the following \r\nangles: the ongoing consultations in the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group; the report of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-first session; and the \r\nreport of the facilitators.  \r\n The 15-year-old ongoing consultations on the \r\nreform of the Security Council, involving Member \r\nStates at the level of Heads of State and Government, \r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs and permanent \r\nrepresentatives, among others, have generated many \r\nideas and proposals, each as important as the others — \r\nso much so that we now find ourselves in the situation \r\nof having difficulty in choosing the best course of \r\naction.  \r\n However, on the basis of consultations held so \r\nfar, my delegation is of the view that the optimum \r\nground has been covered that could provide the \r\nnecessary elements to start intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Those elements may be summed up as \r\nfollows: there can be no meaningful reform of the \r\nCouncil without an expansion of the membership in the \r\ncategory of both permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers; greater representation of the developing \r\ncountries, including small and island States; \r\ncomprehensive improvement in the Council’s working \r\nmethods; and a review of the use of the veto.  \r\n The President of the Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession issued a report (A/61/47) on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, including the reports of the \r\nfacilitators. In her concluding remarks at the end of the \r\nsixty-first session, the President stated, inter alia, that \r\nshe hoped Member States would “have the courage to \r\nbegin discussions on meaningful intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations” (A/61/PV.109, p. 16). Her report, read \r\ntogether with the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome Document on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, underscores the following as points \r\nof prime importance: status quo no longer acceptable; \r\nsupport for early reform of the Security Council; start \r\nof meaningful intergovernmental negotiations; \r\nachievement of comprehensive reform of the Council \r\nin all its aspects; and a more representative, legitimate \r\nand effective Security Council.  \r\n Based on consultations that the facilitators held, \r\nparticularly those about the status quo not being an \r\noption and the fact that flexibility is required to move \r\nthe reform process ahead, they proposed what is \r\ndescribed as an intermediary or transitional approach. \r\nHowever, the facilitators acknowledge that the \r\nparameters of the intermediary approach have yet to be \r\ndefined appropriately and accurately.  \r\n The difficulty of a clear definition is mainly due \r\nto the complexity of the topic under consideration. \r\nThat is also why the facilitators’ reports contain all \r\nalong such vague and inconclusive terms as “a large \r\nnumber of States”, “a group of States”, “overwhelming \r\nmajority” and “a significant number” to describe \r\ncertain proposals and positions. Obviously, these terms \r\ndo not convey a clear picture of the accurate numbers \r\ninvolved. Transparency, objectivity and accountability \r\nof reporting on a subject of such great importance and \r\nmagnitude are essential to enlist the confidence of \r\nMember States.  \r\n The intermediary approach, as proposed by the \r\nfacilitators, is not very different from the transitional \r\napproach that has existed since 1965, when the \r\nSecurity Council was expanded by an additional five \r\nnon-permanent seats. It is certainly not my delegation’s \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 6 \r\n \r\nintention to repeat the same sort of exercise in the \r\npresent changed geopolitical realities of the world.  \r\n Furthermore, the intermediary approach proposes \r\na mandate review at a predetermined date to review \r\nand assess the inadequacy of this arrangement. As \r\nother speakers have pointed out, in the absence of a \r\nclear time frame and an accurately defined mandate, \r\nthe mandate review itself may be doomed to failure, \r\nwith the end result being that we may run the risk of \r\npostponing the comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil for decades.  \r\n The intermediary approach in its present form \r\ncontains the seeds of further perpetuating the historic \r\ninjustice done to Africa. It further eludes the legitimate \r\naspirations of the Common African Position, which \r\ncalls for at least two permanent seats as early as \r\npossible. Ambassador Wang Guangya, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the People’s Republic of China, was \r\nperfectly right when he said yesterday that  \r\n “Any formula on Security Council reform that \r\ndoes not address the concerns of Africa can \r\nhardly win endorsement of the entire United \r\nNations membership and will not have the \r\nbacking of China”. (A/62/PV.48)  \r\n We have observed in the past 10 years that the \r\nuse of the veto in the Security Council has diminished \r\nsignificantly. For example, we have noted that the \r\nUnited States has used it 12 times, the Russian \r\nFederation twice and the People’s Republic of China \r\nthree times. The United Kingdom and France have not \r\nused it during that period. Indeed, the veto has become \r\nan anachronism in an era in which the Berlin wall fell \r\ndown almost two decades ago, democracy is taking \r\nfirm root almost everywhere in the world, from Africa \r\nto Asia, the Latin American and Caribbean region and \r\nEastern Europe, and also at a time when we are \r\nwitnessing wide-scale globalization.  \r\n Ambassador Mahiga, Permanent Representative \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania, in his statement to \r\nthe Working Group on 3 May as Chairman of the \r\nAfrican Group for the month of May 2007, clearly \r\ndescribed the African position on the veto:  \r\n “Africa is opposed in principle to the veto but it \r\nis of the view that so long it exists, and as a \r\nmatter of common justice, it should be made \r\navailable to all permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council. Alternatively, it should be \r\naddressed in a manner to make it progressively \r\ncircumscribed, rendered irrelevant and thereafter \r\nremoved altogether.”  \r\n We salute the legitimate aspirations of those \r\nregional groups and individual Member States that \r\nhave had the courage to rise to the challenge and say \r\nthat they are ready to serve as permanent members \r\nshould a chance be given to them to contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to \r\nserve humankind.  \r\n We are among those who believe that by making \r\nour neighbours and friends stronger we become \r\nstronger, too. That is why Mauritius remains \r\ncommitted to the Common African Position, which \r\ncalls for two permanent seats, with all the privileges, \r\nand five non-permanent seats, as spelt out in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.  \r\n We continue to support the idea of a Member \r\nState from Latin America and the Caribbean having a \r\npermanent seat on the Security Council. We also \r\ncontinue to say that a permanent seat for India is long \r\noverdue, not only because it is a time-tested \r\ndemocracy, the largest in the world, established just \r\nafter the founding of the United Nations, but also \r\nbecause it has proved to the world that, despite being a \r\nmultiracial and multicultural society, and a developing \r\ncountry, it can provide stability, peace and security to \r\nmore than one seventh of the world’s population \r\nwithout any assistance or intervention from the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n Mauritius was one of the sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69, along with India, Brazil, South \r\nAfrica, Nigeria, Benin, Burundi, Rwanda, Cape Verde, \r\nJamaica, Barbados, Papa New Guinea and the Solomon \r\nIslands, to name but a few. Mauritius sponsored it in \r\nfull awareness of its content and implications, and in \r\nconformity with the Common African Position.  \r\n As of now, when we refer to a permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council, we mean a permanent seat with \r\nall its privileges. Indeed, the draft resolution was \r\nsuccessful in breaking the usual stalemate of the Open-\r\nended Working Group by including the element of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in the Group’s report to \r\nthe Assembly at its sixty-first session. As a matter of \r\nfact, it was a wake-up call with regard to adherence to \r\nthe lowest common denominator with regard to \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. It \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n7 07-59704 \r\n \r\ndemonstrated that it was not a matter of business as \r\nusual.  \r\n I conclude on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and other related matters with a \r\nview that is in keeping with the recommendations of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, with paragraph 26 of the second facilitators’ \r\nreport (A/61/47) and with the resolve of the \r\nMillennium Declaration and the Outcome Document of \r\nthe 2005 World Summit of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment. My delegation believes that it is high \r\ntime we initiated intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nwithout any further delay. In this respect, my \r\ndelegation proposes that we adopt an objective and \r\ntransparent mechanism that could determine the \r\nelements that enjoy the widest possible support in \r\norder to start intergovernmental negotiations.  \r\n In conclusion, Mr. President, I assure you of my \r\ndelegation’s total support for an equitable, meaningful, \r\ncomprehensive, transparent, legitimate and effective \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\n Mr. Motoc (Romania): Thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor organizing this debate. My delegation is among \r\nthose that believe that it should — and, indeed, will — \r\nbe the last of this general nature. The feeling of déjà vu \r\nis already too strong. The only assured plus of \r\nrepeating this debate over and over is that it may leave \r\nus with the illusion of staying young.  \r\n It is decades since the last enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council. Soon it will be decades since we \r\nstarted open-ended discussions on how we can set \r\nabout the next. Let us agree that politically it is not \r\nhealthy to have a subject matter open indefinitely for \r\nrevision and reform.  \r\n I refrain from saying “It is now or never”, \r\nalthough the tune plays in many minds each time we \r\ntouch this topic. It is, nevertheless, clear that either we \r\nstart serious enlargement negotiations now or it would \r\nbe better to call it quits, live with the Council as it is \r\nand go about our business.  \r\n If we decide to go for it, we shall find that plenty \r\nof substantive preparatory work has already been done. \r\nWe are overwhelmingly of the view that we need an \r\nenlarged Council so that it is more representative and \r\nmore reflective of today’s political realities.  \r\n We have a framework for an intermediary \r\nenlargement that commands broad support, for under the \r\npresent circumstances it is logical to expand the Council \r\nin both categories of membership. There are several \r\ndraft resolutions on the topic. We also have a fresh \r\nresolution from last September warranting negotiations \r\non the Council’s reform during this session.  \r\n My take from all this is that now you, \r\nMr. President, have a historic opportunity to set the \r\nnegotiating process in motion and see to it that it \r\ndelivers the enlargement of the Security Council. You \r\nknow that on this goal you can count on several times \r\nmore friends among the delegations than on any other \r\nconceivable issue. Please register the unconditional \r\nreadiness of my delegation in that regard.  \r\n A sufficiently representative enlargement might \r\nsignificantly increase ownership of the United Nations \r\nfor countries and nations around the world. Conversely, \r\nlack of reform here would badly hurt the Organization, \r\nfor it would have stayed the same for 40 years, as if \r\nthere had been no such things as the end of the cold \r\nwar or the dawning of the globalization era. At a time \r\nwhen even the climate seems to be changing, one could \r\nchoose to view that as remarkable institutional \r\nstability, yet most would see it as, rather, a recipe for \r\nassured institutional diminution.  \r\n Failure to reform the Council would also mean \r\nthat we had not been able to get our act together and do \r\nour job here in New York. Granted, decision-making on \r\nsuch a delicate political question cannot be confined to \r\nNew York. Our job here, however, is to provide our \r\nleaders with proposals that can inform their policy- and \r\ndecision-making. They actually formally asked us to do \r\nprecisely that back in 2005.  \r\n Let me now sketch briefly the parameters around \r\nwhich the Romanian delegation would develop its \r\nposition for the start of intergovernmental negotiations.  \r\n To be qualitatively meaningful and politically \r\nsustainable, enlargement should encompass both \r\npermanent and non-permanent membership categories. \r\nIf the intermediary formula is pursued to achieve such \r\ncomprehensive enlargement, access to mandates other \r\nthan those currently featuring in the Charter should be \r\ngranted on democratic electoral requirements. While it \r\nmight not be possible to foretell the precise outcome of \r\nthe intermediary process, the process should be subject \r\nto clear review provisions, so that nations can ensure \r\nthrough the democratic means already available in \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 8 \r\n \r\nnational settings that only those qualified take up \r\nspecial obligations in the future enlarged Council.  \r\n The enlargement should consolidate the \r\nconfidence of all Member States that they receive fair \r\ntreatment from the Organization. Equitable \r\ngeographical consideration is a primary requirement in \r\nthat regard. Each Member State would have to see its \r\nchances of serving on the enlarged Council increased. \r\nWhen embarking on the enlargement, however, we \r\nshould remain realistic, and in particular accept that no \r\nformula, no matter how elaborate, no matter how \r\nsophisticated, will achieve the absolute redress of \r\ninherited imbalances.  \r\n The delegation of Romania believes that the \r\npresent Security Council carries out its responsibilities \r\nunder the Charter in an effective, decisive and at the \r\nsame time, depending on the circumstances, self-\r\nrestrained manner. Its enlargement should therefore \r\npreserve those distinctive features. Size-wise, it should \r\nbe possible to achieve that aim by extrapolating the \r\nmagnitude of the previous enlargement to present-day \r\nexpectations.  \r\n For the next enlargement to fly, it is of paramount \r\nimportance that no one should be excluded, and that no \r\narrangements should be construed by some at the \r\nexpense of others. We have already wasted precious \r\ntime by overlooking the resilient nature of the present \r\nregional configuration of the United Nations.  \r\n As we will, hopefully, start working on effecting \r\na twenty-first century enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil, let us forget that it is possible to treat the \r\nEastern Europeans like the Cinderella of the United \r\nNations — although that should probably be a reason \r\nfor optimism, in fact, since in the fairy tale Cinderella \r\neventually had her day under the moon. What the \r\nEastern European Group wants is to emerge from \r\nenlargement with at least one additional elected \r\nmandate.  \r\n As my delegation sees it, while, with a \r\nremarkable display of modesty, no Eastern European \r\nState has so far claimed new permanent status, the \r\naforementioned position means that all options, starting \r\nfrom one additional elected seat, are open.  \r\n Let us hope that we will be able to recall this day \r\nas the day when we decisively relaunched the Security \r\nCouncil enlargement process.  \r\n Mr. Sen (India): We thank you, Mr. President, for \r\nconvening this joint debate on agenda item 9, report of \r\nthe Security Council, and agenda item 122, question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related matters.  \r\n I begin where the Chair of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement ended, by congratulating Burkina Faso, \r\nCosta Rica, Croatia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and \r\nViet Nam on being elected non-permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council. I also express our appreciation \r\nfor the introduction of the Council’s report by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Indonesia.  \r\n Before I come to the report itself, let me say that \r\nwe have just heard about a fairy tale and Cinderella. \r\nThere are some fairy tales that do not have any end, \r\nand this is one of them. Yesterday, I think, I was told \r\nby someone that it was Veterans Day. If it was, then \r\nindeed it was an auspicious occasion to begin this \r\ndebate, because we have so many veterans of these \r\ndebates, and we will continue to have many veterans in \r\nthe years to come if we go on in the present manner. \r\nUltimately, words buffalo past us. \r\n A very interesting book has just been published \r\nby one of our former colleagues, John Bolton of the \r\nUnited States, called Surrender Is Not an Option. In it \r\nhe writes that if he had been paid by the hour, as a \r\nlawyer in one of the United States legal firms is, he \r\nwould have left the United Nations a very rich man. \r\nHis bête noire, the man he really disliked, Lord \r\nMalloch-Brown, said in his Holmes Memorial Lecture \r\non 7 June that there is one organization where one \r\nsubject is discussed more often than sex — and that \r\nsubject is Security Council reform. If Mr. Bolton and \r\nLord Malloch-Brown agree, then quite clearly all this \r\ntorrent of words has not got us very far. We have \r\nreached a point where we are no nearer to Security \r\nCouncil reform. Indeed, unless we move from words to \r\naction, this is likely to remain the case.  \r\n I return to the report. When it was being \r\nintroduced, several issues were mentioned. I refer to \r\none of them, not with any kind of pejorative purpose or \r\nto refer to any individual Member State, but simply to \r\nraise some of the structural problems that the Security \r\nCouncil faces today. I am speaking of the setting up of \r\nspecial tribunals.  \r\n We all know that, while the Security Council can \r\nset up subsidiary bodies, it cannot really give them \r\nlegal powers. The reason is very simple and clear; it is \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n9 07-59704 \r\n \r\nto be found in the old Roman principle of nemo dat qui \r\nnon habet, which means that one cannot give what one \r\ndoes not have. So certain legal infirmities have crept in.  \r\n This becomes even simpler and clearer when we \r\ncome to another issue that was mentioned: thematic \r\ndebates, such as those on natural resources and \r\nconflict. As we know, the subject of natural resources \r\nis one that the General Assembly really ought to deal \r\nwith. This is the old principle of encroachment. In \r\nother words, in spite of the balance in the Charter, \r\nthere is an encroachment that non-permanent members \r\nhave not been able to prevent.  \r\n Across the board, both those who support the G-4 \r\nand those who support Uniting for Consensus have \r\ncriticized several other aspects of the Security \r\nCouncil’s functioning. One example is that the reports \r\nare not analytical. I think that one of the members of \r\nUniting for Consensus said yesterday that the reports \r\nlack any substantial detail or information, and that, in \r\nfact, they have the same deficiencies year after year. \r\nIndeed, this is true.  \r\n Since the non-permanent members have not been \r\nable to set that right, it was a little illogical then to say \r\nthat the Security Council should be expanded only in \r\nthe non-permanent category. Here I must say that we \r\nare very appreciative of the good work done by \r\nSingapore, which went beyond the field of possibilities \r\nin 2002 and put a lot of analytical content into the \r\nreports. But it proved to be an Indian summer, a flash \r\nin the pan. Soon the report went back to the good old \r\ndays — or the bad old days. Therefore, it was a very \r\nshort-lived achievement.  \r\n Similarly, we appreciate the work that was done \r\nquite a few years ago by, for instance, Argentina and \r\nNew Zealand, on involving the troop-contributing \r\ncountries, but that again proved to be equally short-\r\nlived. We have resolution 1353 (2001), but even this has \r\nbeen rarely observed — and then only in the breach. \r\nThat is because when the troop-contributing countries \r\nactually get together with the Security Council, the basic \r\ndraft resolution is already set, the issues are already \r\nresolved — or at least decided upon, because they are \r\nnot really resolved. Therefore, there is very little that the \r\ntroop-contributing countries can contribute.  \r\n And why go to that resolution? It was not even a \r\npartial implementation — and even that was a \r\nfailure — of Article 44 of the Charter, which is very \r\nclear. It states that those that put their troops at the \r\ndisposal of the Security Council have to take part in the \r\ndecision-making: mind you, not discussions, not \r\ndebates, but decisions, which even would imply the \r\nright to vote. But this has not happened. Therefore, the \r\nCharter is unable to, in any manner, decide the working \r\nmethods or what the Security Council does. The \r\nCharter, the supreme constitution of this body, cannot \r\nbe any kind of check on the Security Council, any \r\nmore than the General Assembly can.  \r\n Therefore, we have a situation in which the \r\nSecurity Council demands obedience, under Article 25, \r\nand levies troops, which are contributed by troop-\r\ncontributing countries without any say on their use, \r\ntheir politics and their mandate. It will be remembered \r\nthat demanding obedience and levying troops from \r\nothers was a characteristic of the old feudal and \r\ncolonial systems. Those, in some manner, still \r\ncontinue, which is why the Security Council can feed \r\nwhere it has not furrowed and be warm where it has \r\nnot woven.  \r\n That is the situation regarding some of these \r\nmatters, and I thought it was useful to mention them.  \r\n The representative of one Member State used the \r\nword “inaccessible”; he said that the Security Council \r\nwas becoming more and more inaccessible. And he is \r\nquite right. It is. But it is not simply a matter of the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s telling the members of the Council \r\nto make themselves more accessible, as the “S-5” are \r\ntrying to do. This is quite clear in the Charter itself: \r\nArticles 31 and 32 are very clear that a Member State \r\nwhose interests are affected has to speak in the \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\n Article 31 does say that the Security Council has \r\nthe discretion to decide whether the interests of that \r\nMember State are affected. But once it is clear that its \r\ninterests are affected — this is very important — the \r\nSecurity Council has absolutely no discretion to prevent \r\nit from speaking. This is the clear, legal meaning of \r\nArticle 31, and yet the Charter cannot be implemented.  \r\n As we all know, the non-permanent members, both \r\npre-1965 and post-1965, those that are elected, have not \r\nbeen able, and are not able, in any way to restore the \r\nbalance of the Charter, to ensure that Articles 31, 32, 44 \r\nand so many others are actually implemented.  \r\n Now, the same representative who referred to the \r\ninaccessibility of the Security Council also said, again \r\nvery correctly, that the General Assembly had to \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 10 \r\n \r\nprovide inspiration for reform of the working methods. \r\nBut the point is this: the General Assembly has been \r\ndoing its best to do that, and has been doing it since the \r\nfamous resolution 267 (III) of 14 April 1949, and yet to \r\nno effect over all these years.  \r\n The S-5 draft resolution does not even go as far \r\nas resolution 267 (III). The draft resolution simply \r\ninvites the Security Council to do certain things. What \r\nif the Council rejects the invitation repeatedly, as it has \r\nbeen doing for more than half a century? Quite clearly, \r\nthe non-permanent members have not been able to \r\ncarry forward any improvement in working methods.  \r\n One of the leading lights of Uniting for \r\nConsensus also mentioned the problems, the double \r\nstandards, the non-analytical reports, the closed-door \r\nsessions, the lack of coordination with the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the General Assembly, and so \r\non. To our mind, that criticism is unfair. Members of \r\nthe Assembly may ask why I am indulging in paradox. \r\nIt is unfair because he is saying, on the one hand, “This \r\nis what is wrong with the Security Council”, and, on \r\nthe other hand, that the solution is more non-permanent \r\nmembers, or more non-permanent members who could \r\nbe re-elected, precisely those members that have not \r\nbeen able to check all of this.  \r\n In other words, that representative is simply \r\nexpressing, to use his own words, “great \r\ndissatisfaction”. But he is quite satisfied to live with \r\nthat dissatisfaction. He is quite satisfied with the \r\neuphonious sound of what the representative of another \r\nMember State said, about continuously criticizing the \r\nSecurity Council, year after year, making the same \r\ncriticism, quite satisfied with the annual ritual of this \r\ndebate, in which one has one’s say and goes home.  \r\n On the other hand, there are those who argue in \r\nfavour of a new principle of trying out something new, \r\nof electing members within the group of permanent \r\nmembers who would then be held accountable for \r\nrestoring and maintaining the Charter balance, for \r\npreventing encroachment, and for improving working \r\nmethods, and who would be held accountable through \r\nrepeated review mechanisms. The criticism made by \r\nthose who criticize the Security Council from that \r\nposition is surely at least to that extent fair, because \r\nthey are proposing a way forward, a way out.  \r\n The same leading light of Uniting for Consensus \r\nsaid that there should be representation, but no \r\nrepresentation among the permanent members; that \r\nthere should be checks and balances, but nothing to \r\ncheck or balance the permanent members; that there \r\nshould be democracy. Here I was reminded of \r\nLycurgus, the great lawgiver of the Spartans, who, \r\nwhen somebody asked him “Why do you not set up a \r\ndemocracy?”, responded “Why do you not first set up a \r\ndemocracy in your own home?” Because democracy, \r\nlike charity, really begins at home.  \r\n But, even if we take this principle of democracy, \r\nanother member of Uniting for Consensus said that \r\ndemocracy did not mean leaving the winner in all \r\nperpetuity. However, he forgot address himself to this \r\nquestion: does democracy mean leaving the \r\nuntrammelled power of a few also for all perpetuity, or \r\nshould something be done about it?  \r\n Similarly, another member of Uniting for \r\nConsensus said that there must be continual elections \r\nand that, since non-permanent members are elected, \r\nthat was the only way of ensuring accountability. The \r\npoint is, I would be the first to agree, that elections are \r\na necessary condition. But surely they are not an \r\nassumed condition of accountability. Are the non-\r\npermanent members accountable? And if so, to whom? \r\nDo even the regional groups, which can put forward \r\nclean slates, always find the non-permanent members \r\naccountable? Does the Non-Aligned Movement find all \r\nits members accountable? Therefore, accountability is \r\nsomething much more than simply elections.  \r\n Elections are necessary, of course. That is why I \r\nam saying that those who are elected to be among the \r\npermanent members have to be subjected to repeated \r\nreviews through a self-sustaining review mechanism. \r\nThey also have to be subjected, possibly through some \r\namendments to Chapter II, to the right of recall, the \r\noldest democratic principle.  \r\n But we cannot simply say “Let us go on with \r\nsome kind of short-term interim model — short-term in \r\nterms of the number of years that a member serves — \r\nor purely the expansion of non-permanent \r\nmembership”, and expect to change the state of affairs \r\nin any manner whatsoever. That is the entire crux of \r\nthe issue, which does not mean that we are not \r\nprepared to look at all models.  \r\n One member of Uniting for Consensus said that \r\nwe should not mention anything that would prejudge \r\nthe final outcome, and then went on to contradict \r\nhimself by saying that we should have expansion only \r\nin the non-permanent category. We are not doing that; \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n11 07-59704 \r\n \r\nwe are saying “Let us see how we can take elements of \r\nevery model that has so far been presented and see \r\nhow, on this basis, we can negotiate”. I shall come to \r\nthis subsequently to explain in further detail what this \r\nwould really imply. \r\n The thing is this: we have a situation in which the \r\nSecurity Council truly has become not very satisfactory \r\nin what it does. It has reached a point at which certain \r\nreform of the Council becomes very necessary in itself. \r\nThere used to be in the Council a time when the \r\ncontent went beyond the phrase, but today the phrase \r\ngoes beyond the content. There was a time when its \r\nreach was beyond its grasp, but today its grasp is more \r\nthan its reach. There was a time when the substance \r\nwas more than style; today, the style is more than \r\nsubstance.  \r\n I referred earlier to Mr. John Bolton. His book, \r\nSurrender Is Not an Option, has a very interesting \r\nstatement on page 255: “the Security Council actually \r\ndoes not do most of its jobs well”. Those are his words. \r\nOn page 355 he says that the Security Council actually \r\nmassages the problems but does not resolve them. That \r\nis not my phrase. The greatest critic of the General \r\nAssembly and its oversight, the proponent of \r\nuntrammelled power of the Security Council, actually \r\nsays that the Council only massages problems and does \r\nnot resolve them.  \r\n The only time that the General Assembly really \r\nwas able to provide some working method was in its \r\nfamous resolution 11 (I) of 24 January 1946, in which \r\nit laid out a procedure for the process to select the \r\nSecretary-General. Bolton’s book is very interesting, \r\nbecause it has a whole chapter on the selection process. \r\nIt makes it clear that that General Assembly resolution \r\nhas been only partially observed, because the selection \r\nprocess that he describes is really almost \r\nconspiratorial. It leaves aside all the non-permanent \r\nmembers, and even reduces the say of several \r\npermanent members.  \r\n The picture that Bolton paints — in a long \r\nchapter — of the process to select the Secretary-\r\nGeneral shows that the functioning of the Security \r\nCouncil on this vital issue has been totally dismal and \r\ndysfunctional. This is the irony, the real paradox of our \r\ntime, because this picture validates the unsuccessful \r\nattempt by the General Assembly to have a greater say \r\nand oversight in this selection process. The real irony, \r\nthe real paradox, is that the greatest critic of General \r\nAssembly oversight and its role provides its strongest \r\nproof; he becomes, by implication, the strongest \r\nsupporter of General Assembly oversight and a General \r\nAssembly role in the process. In short, unless some \r\nradical steps are taken, I do not see how this process \r\ncan be carried to a successful conclusion.  \r\n Now let me come to the details of what we would \r\npropose. I refer first to draft resolution A/61/L.69, on \r\nwhich so many comments have been made. It was \r\nprecisely because of the opposition of a tiny minority \r\nof countries, as a result of which the mandate given to \r\nyou initially, Mr. President, was supposed to be without \r\nany reference to intergovernmental negotiations, that \r\nthe draft resolution became necessary. Its achievement \r\nwas quite simple: it enabled the mandate to be very \r\nclear on intergovernmental negotiations, which would \r\nbe concrete, result-oriented and based on the progress \r\nmade at the sixty-first session and on the positions and \r\nproposals of all countries.  \r\n Let me say here that one permanent representative \r\nmade two points on which we are in full agreement.  \r\n One point was that any solution that does not \r\naddress Africa’s concerns is not worth the candle. That \r\nis correct, because, as the Bible also says, the first shall \r\nbe last, and the last shall be first. So those who have \r\nborne more than their share of the burdens and sorrows \r\nof the world should have a place of dignity in the \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\n The second point that that permanent \r\nrepresentative made was that he is prepared for the \r\nlaunch of intergovernmental negotiations, and that \r\ntherefore we need to agree on the content on which we \r\nare to negotiate. The representative of another Member \r\nState, a former facilitator, said that we have now come \r\nto a bridge, and that therefore the practical point is how \r\nwe are to cross it, because, if we do not arrive at a \r\npractical solution, it will become like the bridge too \r\nfar. We need to see how to proceed.  \r\n In that regard, permanent members and members \r\nfrom several other regions have supported permanent \r\nmembership for G-4, including India, and we express \r\nour appreciation to them. But there has been a general \r\nview that the way to arrive at an optimal solution with \r\nthe widest possible support is by launching concrete \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. The question is how to \r\ndo it. And here, instead of speaking on behalf of some \r\nAfrican countries and small States, I think it is much \r\nmore advisable to listen to what the representatives \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 12 \r\n \r\nactually said. Many of them — from Africa, from the \r\nsmall States and the small island developing States — \r\nmade it very clear.  \r\n We have a blizzard of variables. Therefore, on \r\nwhat basis do we start intergovernmental negotiations? \r\nThe representatives to whom I have referred made it \r\nvery clear that, through an objective, transparent \r\nprocess and method, we have to find out what are the \r\nelements — or, at any rate, if I may add, the elements \r\ngrouped in the different packages — that actually \r\ncommand wide support, because only on the basis of \r\nthat legitimation can there be intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. This is crucial. Intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations have to be on a basis that has a certain \r\nlegitimacy, and there is no other legitimacy.  \r\n Some mentioned a questionnaire or straw poll, \r\nand I am sure there could be other ways of doing it. \r\nBut there has to be an objective and transparent \r\nprocess. I think this is perfectly reasonable. It is \r\nwithout prejudice to the positions of any Member \r\nState. It does exactly what the mandate says — that is, \r\nthat on the basis of the progress achieved, which is the \r\nfacilitators’ reports, on the basis of the positions and \r\nproposals of all States, we have to arrive at certain \r\nelements, or a package, on which we can then \r\nnegotiate. And this has to be done through an objective, \r\ntransparent method.  \r\n The question is this: in this case, how are we to \r\ngive a certain impetus or stimulus to the process? With \r\nthat in view, we thought that we could consult with \r\nAfrica about something on these lines to begin with. \r\nThe reason for this is that some African countries had \r\nrequested of us earlier that they would like to be \r\nconsulted before we proceeded further on that.  \r\n Another former facilitator also spoke and said \r\nthat we needed a “text” — and I am quoting his word \r\nexactly — on which to negotiate. He also referred to \r\nthe multiple identities of one of the Member States. He \r\nforgot one identity, which is that of the inquisitor. What \r\nwe have is a Member State that says clearly and \r\ncategorically that we must move forward at present \r\nonly on consultations — there should be no \r\nnegotiations at all. That representative spoke very \r\nforcefully. Actually, he reminded me a little of Colonel \r\nPickering in the Broadway musical My Fair Lady, who \r\nsaid, “I’d rather have a new edition of the Spanish \r\ninquisition”. This was really an inquisitorial approach, \r\nin which he excoriated a number of his colleagues for \r\nactually co-sponsoring draft resolution A/61/L.69, \r\nsaying that that was circumventing the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus. And then, of course, he went on to actually \r\nmention — approvingly and certainly without \r\ncomment — the interim model, which circumvents \r\nboth permanent membership and the veto, without \r\nsaying that this circumvents the Ezulwini Consensus. \r\nHe was, in a sense, really circumventing his own \r\ncircumvention. \r\n The point is this: we do not wish to be drawn into \r\na debate about whether he had proprietary rights on \r\nAfrica, because that is for the African Group to \r\ndetermine. What we are interested in here is whether he \r\nhad even less proprietary rights on logic. He then went \r\non to actually say that there should be more than a \r\ntwo-thirds majority, on which the Ezulwini Consensus \r\nis entirely silent. Thereafter, he said that we — the \r\nG4 group, the African Union, the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group and the so-called small five group — \r\nshould all reach what he called a collective \r\nunderstanding, but without, obviously, touching the \r\nEzulwini Consensus — to which he is totally \r\nattached — and without negotiations — to which he is \r\ntotally opposed — possibly though a mystical meeting \r\nof minds.  \r\n He also went on — I mean, it was really a welter \r\nof contradictions — to say that, as I said earlier, we \r\nhad been asked by the African States for consultation \r\nbeforehand. Here, he reminded me really of Nagaina in \r\nthe short story Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, in Kipling’s Jungle \r\nBook, where Nagaina said, “If you move, I strike. If \r\nyou don’t move, I strike”. That means that if you do \r\nnot consult us beforehand, that is bad, but, if you \r\nconsult us beforehand, that is also bad. \r\n The representative of that Member State also \r\nspoke of civilizational representation and values. Such \r\nmatters are very important. We have the highest respect \r\nfor all civilizations, including the one he comes from. \r\nBut, one of the elements in that civilization, if we \r\nremember, was actually the art of embalming corpses \r\nfor the long term, which are now called mummies. I \r\nhope that he does not want to propose that \r\ncivilizational element, namely, that we should embalm \r\nand mummify Security Council reform for a long time \r\nto come. I do not think that would be acceptable to us, \r\nfor the simple reason that the United Nations has \r\nsometimes been unfavourably compared to the Tower \r\nof Babel. The fact that it has many languages and \r\nviews is a source of its strength: it is strengthening and \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n13 07-59704 \r\n \r\nit is life-giving. But, on the other hand, the language of \r\nthe mandate you, Mr. President, have is very clear: we \r\nmust have intergovernmental negotiations, not \r\nconsultations. Therefore, if it becomes a Tower of \r\nBabel, in the sense that language itself becomes \r\nbabble, then we will find ourselves in a very difficult \r\nsituation.  \r\n I therefore think that it is very important that we \r\nrealize the difference between friction and obstruction. \r\nFriction is a positive thing. The warmth of debate is as \r\nmuch a part of hospitality as the warmth of the fire. We \r\nknow from classical physics that friction is important \r\nfor optimal forward movement. The ship requires the \r\nfriction of the water as it moves forward. The train \r\nrequires the friction of its sliding wheels on the rails as \r\nit moves forward. This is elementary in classical \r\nphysics. But if, on the other hand, you replace friction \r\nwith total obstruction, then what we will have will be \r\nthe ship and the train simply rotting and rusting, and \r\nwe will not get anywhere at all. \r\n I therefore think this is a very important thing: \r\nthat we actually move on to negotiations. \r\nPsychologically, I can, of course, understand that for \r\nmany the prospect of negotiations is a daunting \r\nprospect. It is daunting because it means navigating \r\nthrough multiple tensions. But inaction is politically \r\nunacceptable and morally suspect. \r\n I am sure that I have taken a lot of time. I think I \r\nshould now conclude. But, really, the point is that we \r\nlook forward to your starting a process, Mr. President. \r\nWe have given many suggestions. Many Member \r\nStates — especially small States, which are in the \r\nmajority, and small island States — have spoken very \r\nclearly. We need really to move forward on this issue. \r\nWe need to move forward. And for that, for any period \r\nof change, an increased charge of energy is required. I \r\nam confident that the Assembly and the United Nations \r\nwill have precisely that increased charge of energy, \r\nwhich will enable us to move forward on Security \r\nCouncil reform. \r\n The President: I thank Ambassador Sen, whose \r\nintervention has proved that, even if he can be \r\nextremely long, he is not boring. \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Just a few \r\nhours ago, I returned from Antarctica and Chile’s \r\nPatagonian glaciers, where I accompanied Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and his delegation. However, \r\ndespite the fact that I returned barely some hours ago, I \r\ndid not want to miss this important debate — leaving \r\nbehind the cold of Antarctica for the heat of the debate \r\non the reform of the Security Council, as Ambassador \r\nSen has referred to it with his customary warmth. I \r\nshall not refer to Bolton as much as he has. I hope that \r\nAmbassador Sen will soon refer to my book on Iraq \r\nand the Security Council, which will be published in a \r\nfew months, as often as he has referred to Bolton’s.  \r\n Turning to the issue that the President has \r\nconvened us to debate, I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the Permanent Representative of Indonesia \r\nfor introducing to the General Assembly the report \r\n(A/62/2) of the Security Council covering the period 1 \r\nAugust 2006 to 31 July 2007. I also wish to thank the \r\nChinese delegation for writing the introductory chapter \r\nto the report. \r\n Several of my colleagues here know that Chile \r\nhas been a consistent promoter of a comprehensive \r\nreform of the United Nations that, in reaffirming the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, serves to \r\nincrease the Organization’s credibility and legitimacy. \r\nWe have already taken significant steps towards that \r\nend, but they are not enough. The challenge of \r\nreforming the Security Council is key to the overall \r\nprocess of United Nations reform. This was stated by \r\nheads of State or Government in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). \r\n Indeed, the current composition of the Security \r\nCouncil does not correspond to the international \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century. Clearly, the organ \r\nresponsible for safeguarding international peace and \r\nsecurity should be more representative and democratic. \r\nIt should envision an expansion in its membership that \r\nwould favour developing countries, including those of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, and it should adopt \r\nmore transparent and participatory working methods. \r\n During the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, the discussions on Security Council reform \r\ngained fresh momentum. Thanks to the confidence \r\nvested in the work of a group of facilitators, in which I \r\nwas honoured to take part, and the flexibility of \r\ndelegations, there was progress concerning the idea of \r\nexploring an alternative approach that does not involve \r\nabandonment of anyone’s ideal positions or proposals. \r\n Indeed, the consultations and discussions covered \r\nby the report of the Open-ended Working Group \r\n(A/61/47), adopted by consensus by all its member \r\nStates, demonstrated that the status quo is not \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 14 \r\n \r\nacceptable. For this reason, a compromise solution \r\nwould be a viable way to end stagnation and to move \r\nforward on the vital enlargement and reform of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n Chile believes it is time to embark on an effective \r\nprocess of intergovernmental negotiations and thus to \r\ntest, in practice, the flexibility expressed by the whole \r\nmembership and the viability of the recommendations \r\ncontained in paragraphs d and e of decision 61/561. A \r\nnew series of consultations would be unproductive and \r\nwould distance us from the objective of reform. \r\nWithout constructive, practical, results-oriented \r\nnegotiations, there will be no reform, and we will then \r\nface the dilemma of acting to achieve consensus or of \r\nwaiting perhaps decades to regain the current \r\nmomentum of openness and goodwill demonstrated by \r\na considerable majority of Member States during the \r\nprevious session. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n That is the debate, and that is the dilemma we \r\nneed to face in the coming weeks and months. Chile \r\nwill always be available to make its contribution to the \r\nbuilding of a consensus required for comprehensive \r\nand successful reform of the Organization, and of the \r\nSecurity Council in particular. Chile aims, in particular, \r\nat an effort of compromise and agreement. That has \r\nalways been our policy when faced with complex \r\nissues that can divide us. The President of the \r\nAssembly can rely on our support. \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): Allow me to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening these plenary meetings on this very \r\nimportant issue and welcoming his giving priority to \r\nSecurity Council reform as one of the key items during \r\nhis stewardship of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. I thank Ambassador Marty Natalegawa \r\nof Indonesia for introducing the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/2), and I congratulate the \r\nIndonesian presidency of the Council, which is in the \r\nmidst of a successful Council leadership this month. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to the efforts of Her Excellency Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session, and her facilitators, \r\nnamely the Permanent Representatives of Chile, \r\nCroatia, Cyprus, Liechtenstein, Tunisia and the \r\nNetherlands, for their selfless and tireless efforts to \r\nmove the process of Security Council reform to where \r\nwe are now. My delegation hopes that the letter and the \r\nspirit of the open and transparent consultations on this \r\nmatter conducted during the previous session will \r\ncontinue, with renewed vigour, to pervade this session. \r\n In the annual report of the Security Council, my \r\ndelegation takes note of the ongoing efforts by the \r\nSecurity Council’s Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions to find \r\nways of improving the report. We still feel that the \r\nstrictly factual annual report needs more substance, \r\nsuch as analytical content, which non-members find \r\nmore valuable since official records are available to \r\ndocument events in the Council. We are hopeful that \r\nthe Working Group, currently chaired by Slovakia, will \r\nbe up to the task and will come up with future \r\nrefinements along the lines just mentioned. \r\n My delegation, just like those of other Member \r\nStates, firmly believes that reform of the United \r\nNations is in order and that such reform must be \r\npursued now if the United Nations is to remain faithful \r\nto what its founding fathers wished it to be. Such \r\nreform would not be complete without Security \r\nCouncil reform. We reiterate our strong belief that \r\nSecurity Council reform is critically and urgently \r\nneeded and that demands for it have become \r\nirresistible. We must not forget that in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome, our heads of State and Government \r\nmade it clear that they “support early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council — an essential element of the overall \r\neffort to reform the United Nations” (resolution 60/1, \r\npara. 153). In that regard, my delegation takes this \r\nopportunity today to highlight the following points. \r\n First, we must build on the progress achieved \r\nthus far, particularly at the sixty-first session, by \r\nseriously considering the various proposals at hand and \r\nworking doubly hard to achieve concrete positive \r\nresults, including through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, at this session. We should take advantage \r\nof the momentum. We should endeavour to reach \r\nagreement on reform issues where we can, without \r\nfurther delay, and later take up issues where we cannot. \r\nIn short, reform proposals which can be adopted now \r\nmust be approved now. \r\n Secondly, an area where possible agreement can \r\nbe reached without much debate is on the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council. My delegation \r\nbelieves that improvement of working methods is \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n15 07-59704 \r\n \r\nessential and is an integral part of Security Council \r\nreform. The issue of access, particularly relating to the \r\nprovisions on, or regarding due process for, States \r\nunder Security Council review, as well as issues related \r\nto consultations, transparency and coordination or \r\ncooperation with other organs of the United Nations, \r\nshould be included in whatever intermediary \r\narrangements may be agreed upon. Pragmatic changes \r\nin working methods are the best hope at the moment \r\nfor meaningful change in the Security Council. We \r\nmust, forthwith and without any further delay, use \r\nevery opportunity to accomplish as soon as possible \r\nreform on working methods. It bears stressing that, \r\npursuant to Article 24 of the Charter, the Security \r\nCouncil acts on behalf of all Member States. Hence, \r\ndue process, accountability and transparency demand \r\nthat its working methods serve and fulfil such \r\nelements. \r\n Thirdly, on the issue of enlargement, my \r\ndelegation fully supports the enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council in both categories of membership, \r\nbased on equitable geographic distribution reflecting \r\nthe geopolitical realities of today. The United Nations \r\nmust truly be the world’s model for a fully functioning \r\nparticipatory democracy. It would be a contradiction in \r\nprinciple and in practice and a travesty of justice if the \r\nmembership of the Security Council, one of the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations given the \r\nimportant task of maintaining peace and security, did \r\nnot reflect the prevailing context of its existence. We \r\nhope that, at the very least, general agreement among \r\nMember States can be achieved on this issue during \r\nthis session. \r\n My delegation prays that the General \r\nAssembly — through political will and determined, \r\nsustained and unceasing effort — can come up with an \r\noutcome based on this practical approach before the \r\nend of the sixty-second session. We look forward to \r\nintensive discussion, consultation and negotiations on \r\nthese very important issues during the sixty-second \r\nsession. My delegation assures the President of an \r\nequally determined, sustained and unceasing \r\ncontribution in that regard. \r\n Mr. Bródi (Hungary): Allow me, first of all, to \r\nthank the President for convening these meetings for a \r\njoint debate on the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/62/2) and on the \r\nissue of Security Council reform. I also wish to thank \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Indonesia, President \r\nof the Security Council for the month of November, for \r\nhis presentation of the Security Council’s report \r\nyesterday morning. \r\n We believe that the report is an important \r\ninstrument in the dialogue among the general \r\nmembership on the work of the Security Council. It \r\nstrikingly reflects the huge workload of the Council \r\nand the wide scope of the issues it has to tackle in \r\ndischarging its mandate. A number of Member States, \r\nhowever, have expressed the view that the report could \r\nbe improved and made more relevant. In the view of \r\nour delegation, that illustrates the need to find other \r\ncomplementary means of interaction between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. \r\n Comprehensive reform of the Security Council \r\nconstitutes one of the most important elements of the \r\noverall reform of the United Nations. Without it there \r\ncannot be meaningful reform of the Organization. On \r\nthat point, I guess, Member States are overwhelmingly \r\nagreed. \r\n During the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, many creative and useful proposals and \r\nideas emerged with regard to Security Council reform, \r\nbut substantive progress once again proved to be \r\nelusive. The consultations and deliberations in the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of \r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council, which have been going \r\non for more than a decade, have resulted in a clear \r\npicture with regard to the positions of Member States. \r\nIn our view, a mere continuation of those discussions \r\nin the same format would be a waste of resources and \r\ntime. We must take the process a step further. \r\n The time has come to start structured and results-\r\noriented intergovernmental negotiations on the basis of \r\na flexible and creative mandate that takes into account \r\nall the views expressed by Member States. The efforts \r\nof the former President of the General Assembly and \r\nthe reports that resulted from her initiatives should be \r\nfollowed up during the current session of the General \r\nAssembly. Member States should try to come to an \r\nagreement on an effective framework for negotiations. \r\nWe have no doubt that an agreement on such a \r\nframework will require creativity, flexibility and \r\npolitical will on the part of Member States. \r\n We agree with the President of the General \r\nAssembly that in identifying the negotiables we ought \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 16 \r\n \r\nto be guided by the latest report of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group (A/61/47). We also agree that that \r\nprocess is the primary responsibility of Member States. \r\n In sum, Hungary believes that comprehensive \r\nintergovernmental negotiations that tackle both the \r\nissue of expansion and the improvement of the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council and are based on a \r\ntransparent and flexible mandate defined by the \r\nGeneral Assembly offer the best way forward at this \r\nstage. We are sure that, under the guidance and \r\nleadership of the President of the General Assembly, \r\nthe sixty-second session will produce a breakthrough in \r\nfinding an acceptable way forward on Security Council \r\nreform. We pledge our support to that effort. \r\n Mr. Cheok (Singapore): Allow me to thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of Indonesia for introducing \r\nthe report of the Security Council (A/62/2). I also wish \r\nto express my gratitude to the Permanent Representative \r\nof India for his kind words about Singapore. \r\n It was difficult to prepare for this debate, because \r\nwe have been discussing this issue for so long. I think \r\nthat many of us have even found ourselves repeating \r\nsimilar statements over the past two years. I think that \r\nit is time to try to break out of this cycle of repetition. I \r\nam not saying that the discussions over the past few \r\nyears have been wasted. Ideas and opinions have been \r\nraised and debated. The positions of the African Union, \r\nthe Group of Four, the Uniting for Consensus group \r\nand the so-called small five group are well known. Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session, \r\nencouraged the Open-ended Working Group on the \r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase \r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other \r\nMatters Related to the Security Council to play an \r\nactive role in exploring options. The five-facilitator \r\nand then the two-facilitator processes helped shed light \r\non the complexities, as did draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.69/Rev.1. \r\n Obviously, there remains a divergence in views. \r\nNo position has managed to garner consensus so far. \r\nBut I think that what we have established is that the \r\nstatus quo is unacceptable for most. In the last days of \r\nher presidency, Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa presided \r\nover the unanimous call for the General Assembly to \r\nconsider how concrete results may be achieved, \r\nincluding through intergovernmental negotiations. The \r\nobjective is clear, but the way to achieve it is not. Our \r\nchallenge, therefore, is to find an acceptable way \r\nforward. \r\n I am not advocating a specific course of action; \r\nnor am I championing any particular outcome. I am \r\nmerely trying to assess the situation dispassionately. It \r\nappears to us that there are two main ways of moving \r\nthe process forward. One option is for a group of \r\ncountries, of whatever persuasion, to put forth a draft \r\nresolution for consideration and negotiation. That \r\nwould set the parameters for discussion and allow \r\nmembers to calibrate their approach and express their \r\nconcerns or support accordingly. With a concrete \r\nproposal, we would have the beginnings of a complex \r\nnegotiation. \r\n Given the issue, however, there may be strong \r\nresistance to any proposal coming from just one set of \r\ncountries. Perhaps divisiveness could be lessened if the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly assumed a direct \r\nrole in seeking a solution acceptable to the broader \r\nmembership. I recognize that that is putting a huge \r\nresponsibility on the shoulders of the President. But the \r\nreality is that the facilitators processes have led to a \r\nnumber of views and opinions. Taken individually, \r\nthose ideas run the gamut. \r\n Are there other impartial players here who can \r\nbring those ideas together in a coherent whole that is \r\nbroadly acceptable to most? Most delegations, mine \r\nincluded, have already taken positions in this debate. \r\nOn the other hand, a process on expansion, and perhaps \r\non working methods, that is driven by the President of \r\nthe General Assembly may have the requisite \r\nimpartiality. \r\n I stress that I am not advocating a particular \r\napproach. Obviously, Singapore is a small country with \r\nno aspirations for permanent membership. I do, \r\nhowever, champion the interests of small States. Small \r\nStates have little opportunity to serve regularly on the \r\nSecurity Council. Some may never even serve at all. \r\nTherefore, reviewing and improving the Council’s \r\nworking methods is equally important. In short, \r\nregardless of how we decide to move ahead, \r\ndiscussions should not simply be geared to \r\naccommodating the interests of the larger countries and \r\nthe middle Powers. The views and interests of small \r\nStates, which make up the majority of the United \r\nNations, should also be taken into account. The best \r\nway to do that is to make sure that any discussions or \r\nnegotiations are open, transparent and inclusive. \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n17 07-59704 \r\n \r\n Mr. Kryzhanivskyi (Ukraine): I would like to \r\nexpress our gratitude to Ambassador Marty Natalegawa \r\nof Indonesia, President of the Security Council for the \r\nmonth of November, for his presentation of the annual \r\nreport (A/62/2) of the Security Council to the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n During the period under review the international \r\ncommunity has continued to face numerous challenges \r\nthat directly relate to the Security Council’s main \r\nsphere of responsibility: the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n The credibility of the United Nations will always \r\nbe measured by the Organization’s ability to \r\nadequately respond to threats in any region of the \r\nworld. No organization is better equipped to deal with \r\nthose issues. The United Nations should lead global \r\nefforts to address global challenges, which demand \r\nglobal solutions. At the same time, we need to take \r\nfurther steps down the path of reforming and \r\nimproving the mechanisms of the United Nations, in \r\norder to make the Organization more efficient, more \r\neffective and more relevant in the twenty-first century.  \r\n We hope that the process of Security Council \r\nreform, which is the key element in the process of \r\nrenewing the United Nations, will be expedited and \r\nthat it will eventually yield tangible results. Making \r\nthat body more representative and balanced, and its \r\nwork more effective and transparent, especially with \r\nregard to decision-making, is vital in adapting the \r\nUnited Nations to the global realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.  \r\n With regard to the specific aspects of Security \r\nCouncil reform, Ukraine’s position is based on the \r\nfollowing principles. First, Security Council reform \r\nshould be implemented in strict compliance with the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Secondly, the enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil is to be carried out in both categories, the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent. We support \r\nincreased representation in that body for developing \r\ncountries from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. Thirdly, as the composition of the Group of \r\nEastern European States has more than doubled over \r\nthe past decade, it should have an additional \r\nnon-permanent seat. Fourthly, the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council should result in the improvement of \r\nits working methods. Those countries that contribute \r\nmost to the Organization — militarily, diplomatically \r\nand financially — should be more involved in the \r\ndecision-making process of the Council. Fifthly, the \r\nuse of veto by the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil has to be limited. \r\n We recognize the significant progress made by \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of \r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nRelated to the Security Council during previous \r\nsessions of the General Assembly. We welcome its \r\ndecision to continue to work during the sixty-second \r\nsession. We also support the launch of an \r\nintergovernmental negotiating process on the reform of \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n Mr. Løvald (Norway): Let me first express \r\nNorway’s appreciation for the President’s timely \r\ninitiative to hold this debate now. We believe it is \r\nimportant to build on the progress made over the past \r\nyear on the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council. \r\nThe two reports by the facilitators of the President’s \r\npredecessor (see A/61/47) have offered valuable ideas \r\nas to the way forward and have generated important \r\nmomentum. Now is the time to take advantage of that \r\nmomentum and bring the discussion on reform \r\nforward. \r\n We have made our position clear during previous \r\nconsultations, and it remains the same. Norway’s main \r\npriorities are to ensure that the Council operates \r\ncoherently and efficiently and that the composition of \r\nthe Council reflects the current configuration of the \r\nmembership of the United Nations. Consequently, we \r\nsupport expansion in both categories. We would, \r\nhowever, welcome any constructive proposals that \r\ncould break the current deadlock. At this stage I would \r\ntherefore like to make the following points. \r\n First, if we are to succeed in completing the \r\nreform process initiated by our political leaders at the \r\n2005 World Summit, we need to look for a process that \r\ncan move us ahead. While we the Member States need \r\nto show flexibility and seek compromise, it is also our \r\nview that in order to succeed we need to establish a \r\nprocess that commands the broadest possible support in \r\norder to ensure a legitimate and credible outcome. \r\n Secondly, we need concrete proposals in order to \r\nmaintain focus and move the discussions forward. In \r\nthat respect, we are open to discussions that do not \r\nprejudge any final arrangements. \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 18 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, it is our view that the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly should guide this transparent and \r\ninclusive process, ensuring the active participation of \r\nall Member States in an intergovernmental process. \r\n The overarching objective for Norway is to find \r\nsolutions that will secure the continued legitimacy of \r\nthe Council and provide broader representation for the \r\nvarious regions, without at the same time \r\ncompromising the efficiency of the Council. Norway is \r\nopen to discuss all proposals that aim at achieving that. \r\nReform is timely and necessary, and we appeal to all \r\nMember States to show flexibility and to be open-\r\nminded. \r\n Mrs. Silkalna (Latvia): Allow me to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the Security Council for \r\nintroducing the Council’s annual report (A/62/2). \r\nWhile it lacks analytical content that might have \r\nstimulated more substantive debate on this item, the \r\nreport is useful as a reference document. \r\n With regard to the next agenda item, we thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening this \r\ndebate on an integral aspect of United Nations reform. \r\nAs the position of my delegation on the substance of \r\nSecurity Council reform has been outlined in previous \r\ndebates, I will limit myself to brief remarks on process. \r\n Consideration of Security Council reform has \r\ntaken place for well over a decade. We are all aware of \r\nthe complexity and sensitivity of the issue and the need \r\nfor a steady approach. At the same time, the lack of \r\nconcrete results in this aspect of reform has had a \r\ncorrosive effect on other ongoing processes within the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n We therefore note with appreciation the progress \r\nachieved during the sixty-first session whereby \r\nMember States were widely consulted on the question \r\nof Security Council reform. The resulting report \r\nadopted by the Open-ended Working Group (A/61/47) \r\nreveals the extent of support for renewed efforts \r\ntowards Security Council reform and gives us a solid \r\nbasis for carrying forward during this session. In our \r\nview, the stage has been reached where the General \r\nAssembly can and should begin preparations within the \r\ncurrent session for intergovernmental negotiations.  \r\n My delegation has full confidence in the \r\nleadership and wisdom of the President of the \r\nAssembly to identify the most suitable format for such \r\npreparations. We pledge our support to him in this \r\nendeavour so that momentum for Security Council \r\nreform is maintained. \r\n Mr. Palouš (Czech Republic): At the outset, let \r\nme join the previous speakers in thanking Ambassador \r\nNatalegawa, the Permanent Representative of \r\nIndonesia, for presenting the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/62/2) to the General Assembly. This \r\ndocument is a testament to the increasing challenges \r\nthat the Security Council, the key body of the United \r\nNations system, is facing.  \r\n Recent reports of the Security Council show \r\nclearly that the number of issues on its agenda \r\ncontinues to grow and that the burden on the shoulders \r\nof its members, both permanent and non-permanent, \r\ngets heavier and heavier. Those issues relate to major \r\nregional conflicts and cross-cutting challenges to our \r\ncommon security, including the fight against terrorism \r\nand against the proliferation of arms of mass \r\ndestruction. Therefore, it is in the interest of all United \r\nNations Member States that the Security Council be \r\nable to act in an open, transparent, effective and, last \r\nbut not least, a more democratic manner.  \r\n As many speakers before me have already \r\nunderlined, the Security Council has the primary \r\nresponsibility to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, as stipulated in the Charter. At the same time, \r\nthe work of the Council would not be successful \r\nwithout the support of the broader membership. The \r\nreal commitment of all Member States and their active \r\ninvolvement is in this respect crucial for the successful \r\nfulfilment of the role of the Council. The conclusion \r\ncould not be clearer: a reform of the Security Council \r\nis already overdue and is essential.  \r\n The question of the involvement of Member \r\nStates is first of all directly related to the question of \r\nthe improvement of the Security Council’s working \r\nmethods. In other words, achieving the goal of the \r\neffective functioning of the Council is not possible \r\nunless this important subject is appropriately \r\naddressed. \r\n Over the past 14 years, the Czech Republic has \r\nrepeatedly expressed its view that the current \r\nchallenges we are confronting can be properly \r\naddressed only through structural reforms of the \r\nSecurity Council. These reforms should in our view \r\nencompass all well-known elements: the expansion of \r\nmembership in both categories, better representation \r\nand regional equitability.  \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n19 07-59704 \r\n \r\n All these issues have been debated in detail, and \r\nmany useful ideas and concepts have been put forward. \r\nThe Czech Republic has taken an active part in these \r\ndebates and shares fully the conviction expressed by \r\nthe overwhelming majority of Member States that the \r\nstatus quo is not an option. \r\n With that conviction in mind, the Czech Republic \r\nhas been among the sponsors of the so-called Group of \r\nFour proposal from July 2005. Without being stubborn \r\nor dogmatic, we continue to believe that the main \r\nelements of this proposal constitute a sound basis for \r\nour future deliberations. At the same time, I wish to \r\nunderline our readiness to exercise the necessary \r\nflexibility in order to find common ground to serve as a \r\nnew point of departure in formulating compromises \r\nacceptable to all. \r\n We are strongly convinced that during the sixty-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly we achieved \r\nsome important progress thanks to the dedication and \r\nenergy of the President’s predecessor, Ambassador \r\nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, as well as the work done by \r\ntwo groups of facilitators. Some innovative ideas were \r\nintroduced in order to bridge differences between well-\r\nknown positions and to move the discussions forward, \r\ninter alia, the concept of an intermediate approach. \r\nThat concept in our opinion might open a new path \r\ntowards a possible solution while avoiding an impasse \r\nof repetitive and unproductive discussions.  \r\n Let me underline the position of my country: we \r\nhave to do our utmost to build on the momentum that \r\nwas created during the Assembly’s sixty-first session. \r\nIt is encouraging that the vast majority of the United \r\nNations membership, as has been demonstrated in this \r\ndebate during the last two days, is ready to engage in \r\nthis endeavour.  \r\n The Czech Republic is ready to consider all \r\nconcrete proposals enabling us to finally get the reform \r\nprocess off the ground and to start intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the Assembly’s current session. Let \r\nme conclude by assuring the Assembly President of our \r\nfull support in this challenging task of steering the \r\ndiscussions in the coming weeks and months. \r\n Mrs. Intelmann (Estonia): May I first join others \r\nin thanking Ambassador Marty Natalegawa, President \r\nof the Security Council, for his presentation on the \r\nwork of the Council. My delegation also appreciates \r\nthe efforts made by Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, and her facilitators. We would like to thank \r\nthem all for their important contributions towards \r\nmoving Security Council reform forward.  \r\n We welcome the report of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group, and we support the decision to \r\ncontinue considering Security Council reform at the \r\npresent session so that further concrete results may be \r\nachieved, including through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We feel that, given the comprehensive \r\nanalysis of the situation carried out by the facilitators \r\nduring the last session, the current session should not \r\nrepeat this work and instead bring the process to a \r\nqualitatively new level.  \r\n Security Council reform remains a pressing issue \r\nin the overall United Nations reform process. The \r\nCouncil’s reform must contribute to adding more \r\nlegitimacy and credibility to its decisions and should \r\nnot hamper its capability and effectiveness in adapting \r\nto the challenges of the twenty-first century. However, \r\nany reform needs the largest possible political \r\nacceptance; greater flexibility on all sides is urgently \r\nneeded if we want to overcome the current stalemate.  \r\n Enlarged membership and equitable geographic \r\nrepresentation should be the fundamental principles \r\nguiding the enlargement of the category of \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council. As \r\nhas been stated on many occasions, members of the \r\nGroup of Eastern European States consider that any \r\nincrease in the non-permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council should ensure an enhanced \r\nrepresentation of that particular Group by the \r\nallocation of at least one additional non-permanent seat \r\nto the Group. Allow me to also recall that, since 1991, \r\nthe Group has more than doubled its membership. \r\n Estonia favours an increase of Security Council \r\nmembership in non-permanent and permanent \r\ncategories. \r\n We also support the reform of the working \r\nmethods, and we are convinced that the expansion and \r\nthe reform of working methods should not be seen as \r\ninseparable. Indeed, efforts to improve the working \r\nmethods should continue, irrespective of progress in \r\nother areas. \r\n My delegation remains ready to participate \r\nactively in the results-oriented intergovernmental \r\nprocesses, including negotiations, in a very flexible \r\nmanner. Given the fact that the reform process has \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 20 \r\n \r\nlasted for far over 10 years, it is important to create a \r\nnew political momentum for possible negotiations. For \r\nthat, high-level political involvement would be \r\nnecessary from the very outset. The negotiations — if \r\nstarted — must be transparent and give all Member \r\nStates equal opportunities to take part in the \r\ndeliberations, building on the progress achieved and \r\nthe positions of and proposals made by Member States. \r\nIt is our conviction that under the able leadership of the \r\npresent session, the reform process will move ahead \r\nand we will arrive at a successful outcome. The status \r\nquo is unacceptable, and we should make all attempts \r\nto move forward. \r\n Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to begin by welcoming the convening of \r\nthis meeting to consider the report of the Security \r\nCouncil and the question of equitable representation on \r\nit and increase in its membership. We are also grateful \r\nto the Permanent Representative of Indonesia, \r\nMr. Natalegawa, President of the Council, for having \r\npresented the Council’s report to the Assembly. \r\n Costa Rica agrees with the President of the \r\nAssembly that this should be an opportunity to \r\nreinforce the relationship between the Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. But that has not proved to be the \r\ncase. Once again, we are taking part in a meeting that, \r\nfor the vast majority of delegations, is merely another \r\nopportunity to point out the deficiencies of a document \r\nthat is not the report that we would wish to receive and \r\nthat, in general, lacks the information that Member \r\nStates would like to discuss. In spite of the fact that the \r\nvery broad majority of States, year after year, demands \r\na report that would be in full accordance with the spirit \r\nof the Charter, in an ever-repeating rite we hear the \r\nsame voices from the Council reassuring us that, \r\ncontrary to our repeated demand, the report includes \r\neverything that it should include.  \r\n On earlier occasions, Costa Rica has made the \r\npoint that the report should be a tool enabling the \r\nAssembly to learn about, evaluate and discuss the work \r\nof the Security Council. As was rightly pointed out by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Mexico, the functions \r\nof the Assembly and those of the Council are \r\nconcurrent in the area of the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. That was confirmed \r\nby the International Court of Justice in July 2004.  \r\n The practice of healthy interaction between the \r\nAssembly and the Security Council, far from \r\nweakening the Council, would strengthen it in the eyes \r\nof the international community and the world public \r\nopinion. The Council, and the United Nations as a \r\nwhole, would thus gain greater legitimacy.  \r\n In making these comments and demands, Costa \r\nRica is not naive. We recognize the limitations and \r\ndifficulties that prevail when one is trying to report in \r\ndetail on the work of the Council, even above and \r\nbeyond the difficulty of finding agreement in a \r\ncollegial body on the content of a report that covers \r\nthat body’s work. But those limitations should not \r\nprevent States that are not represented on the Council \r\nfrom having access to the necessary information in \r\norder to learn about and understand the decision-\r\nmaking process in a body that, in the last analysis, acts \r\non behalf of the Members of this Organization, \r\naccording to the provisions of article 24, paragraph 1, \r\nof the Charter. \r\n Costa Rica, as a newly elected member of the \r\nSecurity Council, and any other State that will serve in \r\nthat body, would be better prepared and could make \r\nbetter contribution to the efficiency of the Council, if \r\nwe were annually apprised of its work in a clearer and \r\nmore focused form.  \r\n Allow me to take this opportunity to express our \r\nthanks for the generous support received by Costa Rica \r\nin its election to the Security Council. I would also like \r\nto congratulate Burkina Faso, Croatia, the Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya and Viet Nam, also elected to serve on the \r\nCouncil in 2008 and 2009. Costa Rica has undertaken \r\nto represent States that will not be taking part in the \r\ndeliberations and decisions of the Council. We will not \r\nforget that we are only temporarily non-permanent \r\nmembers of the Council and that we will always be \r\npermanent Members of the Assembly. \r\n During the previous session, in the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the \r\nSecurity Council, we achieved important progress, \r\npartly thanks to the work of the former President of the \r\nAssembly and the distinguished facilitators that she \r\nappointed.  \r\n The position of Costa Rica on this process is \r\nclear. Security Council reform should be a means of \r\nachieving greater efficiency, transparency and \r\nlegitimacy for an organ that acts on behalf of all \r\nMember States, and must never be an end in itself or a \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n21 07-59704 \r\n \r\nmeans to gratify the particular interests or aspirations \r\nof any one Member State. We hardly feel that it is \r\nnecessary to repeat the details of our position \r\nconcerning Council reform, which are widely known in \r\nthis Hall.  \r\n We would like to say, however, that we are firm \r\nin upholding the proposals that we have made through \r\nthe “Small 5” group and that we believe that reform of \r\nthe working methods is the measure that will provide \r\nthe greatest benefit to the largest possible number of \r\nStates represented in this Hall. I would add that the \r\nposition of refusing to advance the reform of the \r\nworking methods if there is no progress in the \r\nexpansion of the Council is a trap that benefits just a \r\nfew and denies the vast majority of States their rights \r\nand opportunities.  \r\n When it comes to the expansion of the Council, \r\nCosta Rica still harbours the hope that the membership \r\nultimately will decide to support the enlargement of the \r\nCouncil by means of an increase in the number of \r\nnon-permanent members. This, without question, is the \r\nmost constructive solution for the great majority of \r\nStates and the only one capable in the short term of \r\nachieving the broadest possible agreement among \r\nmembers of this Organization. \r\n It has been two years since Costa Rica prepared a \r\ndocument, which has been circulated as official, under \r\nthe title of the “cascade effect”. In this document \r\n(A/59/856), we demonstrated in an incontestable \r\nfashion that permanent member status is the source of \r\nmany privileges in this Organization; and today, as \r\nthen, we remain convinced that it is not in the interests \r\nof the vast majority of the Assembly to extend to just a \r\nfew the privileges that are already enjoyed by the \r\nvictors of the Second World War. \r\n Having said this, I would like to express our \r\nparticular concern about the situation in Africa. For \r\nreasons known to us all, when we adopted the San \r\nFrancisco Charter, the States present accepted an \r\nexception to the principle of sovereign equality of \r\nStates, assigning special privileges to five Member \r\nStates. On that occasion, practically the whole of \r\nAfrica was excluded; only four African countries took \r\npart in that decision. Costa Rica believes that this \r\nhistorical injustice must be given special consideration \r\nin any model of Security Council reform, the primary \r\nobjective being to restore equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation. \r\n Perhaps in this phase of the process, where we \r\nstand now, it might be advisable to review options that \r\npromote approaches which, like the African model, \r\nwould transcend the shortsightedness of individual \r\ninterests and re-establish the primacy of the concept of \r\ncollective interests, which are the foundation of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n Costa Rica has never been timid in this matter. \r\nWe participate actively, with the conviction that it is in \r\nour best interests and that of our peoples to have a \r\ndynamic, effective Organization that matches up to the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. We view the role \r\nof the presidency as one of facilitator of our debates, as \r\nwell as the proponent of our consensuses. If we really \r\nwish to start a negotiating process that will ultimately \r\nenable us to have consensus-based reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, we must travel together along the \r\navenues of dialogue in order to make progress in the \r\nquest for solutions reflecting our common interests and \r\nnot solely the national aspirations of just a few. \r\n The perfect is the enemy of the good. Our \r\ncommon objective is a more legitimate, democratic, \r\nrepresentative and efficient Security Council, capable \r\nof responding effectively to the challenges and threats \r\nto international peace and security. This can only be \r\nachieved if we avoid falling into a pattern of \r\nconfrontation or resort to force or the obsessive pursuit \r\nof national aspirations that, without question, will \r\nnever be realized. \r\n Costa Rica would appeal for us all to be idealistic \r\nin our aims and pragmatic in seeking the path that will \r\nlead us to our goals. Right now we offer our assistance, \r\nwith a view to supporting actively any initiative \r\ndirected to those ends. \r\n Mr. Penjo (Bhutan): I will be very brief, as many \r\nof the issues of interest to my delegation have already \r\nbeen raised by previous speakers. \r\n I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in \r\nthe joint debate on agenda items 9 and 22. My \r\ndelegation would like to convey its appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Natalegawa of Indonesia, current \r\nPresident of the Security Council, for his presentation \r\nof the annual report of the Security Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The issue of Security Council reform has been on \r\nour agenda for nearly a decade and a half. We have \r\ndeliberated at great length on why the Security Council \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 22 \r\n \r\nneeds to be reformed, and various ideas and proposals \r\nhave been presented in that regard, including those on \r\nimproving the working methods. The sixty-first session \r\nof the General Assembly, under the leadership of Her \r\nExcellency Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, generated good \r\nmomentum and adopted an important decision on \r\n17 September 2007. By decision 61/561, the issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform is to be considered during the \r\npresent session, so that further concrete results may be \r\nachieved, including through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, building on the progress achieved so far \r\nand on the positions and proposals made by Member \r\nStates. My delegation welcomed the decision since, in \r\nour view, intergovernmental negotiations are the only \r\nway forward to address this sensitive and complex \r\nissue. Without such a process, the concrete ideas and \r\nproposals made over the years will remain just empty \r\nwords. \r\n My delegation would like to request the President \r\nof the General Assembly to initiate, without delay, the \r\nprocess of intergovernmental negotiations. We also \r\nrequest that he determine, through an objective and \r\ntransparent method, the elements that command the \r\nwidest support, so that they can serve as the basis for \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. Only through this \r\nprocess, we believe, can comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council be achieved and its legitimacy and \r\ncredibility enhanced. In this context, my delegation \r\nwould like to reiterate its position that the Council \r\nshould be expanded in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories and allow for greater \r\nrepresentation by developing countries, including \r\nbetter access for small States. We also reiterate our call \r\nfor a comprehensive overhaul of the Council’s working \r\nmethods in order to make it more transparent and \r\ninclusive. \r\n Mr. Burian (Slovakia): Mr. President, we thank \r\nyou for your timely initiative in convening this meeting \r\nto address the annual Security Council report together \r\nwith the wider issue of a comprehensive reform of the \r\nCouncil. We are convinced that under your able \r\nleadership we will be able to achieve tangible progress \r\non this issue during this session of the General \r\nAssembly, building on the positive results achieved \r\nduring the previous session. You can count on my \r\ndelegation’s full support and active participation in that \r\nimportant endeavour. \r\n Regarding the Security Council reform, my \r\ndelegation continues to believe that both its parts are \r\nequally important, namely, first, adequate change in the \r\ncomposition of the Council to better reflect the \r\ngeopolitical realities of today’s world and, secondly, a \r\nmeaningful reform of the Council’s working methods. \r\nBoth of these aspects should be aimed at ensuring the \r\nCouncil’s legitimacy, authority, effectiveness and \r\nrepresentativeness. Like other delegations, we are also \r\nof the view that one part of the comprehensive reform \r\nshould not be held hostage to the other. We should do \r\nour best to achieve maximal results on each of these \r\ntwo tracks. \r\n During the sixty-first session, my delegation very \r\nmuch welcomed and supported the work of and reports \r\nby the facilitators. We believe that the concept of the \r\nintermediate or transitional approach, with a mandatory \r\nreview to take place at a predetermined date, could be a \r\nmeaningful way forward. What we need now is an \r\nintergovernmental process of negotiations that would \r\nlead to a possible road map out of the current impasse. \r\nWe are looking forward to hearing your \r\nrecommendations, Mr. President, on how this process \r\ncould be taken forward. \r\n On the issue of increasing the Security Council’s \r\nrelevance, authority and effectiveness, I would like to \r\nhighlight at least one crucial aspect that we feel very \r\nstrongly about. I refer here to conflict prevention and \r\npreventive diplomacy. We believe that in order for the \r\nCouncil to play a significantly more relevant and active \r\nrole with respect to the current threats and challenges \r\nto international peace and security, it must improve its \r\nperformance in the area of conflict prevention. It is no \r\nlonger enough just to react to emerging situations and \r\nongoing conflicts or to come up with post-conflict \r\nremedies, such as United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. In this context, we sincerely welcome the \r\nrecent initiative of the Secretary-General to reform the \r\nUnited Nations Department of Political Affairs in order \r\nto strengthen its preventive diplomacy and mediation \r\nfunctions. \r\n Along the same lines, I would like to highlight \r\nthe importance of constant interaction and dialogue \r\namong the various parts of the United Nations system, \r\nin particular the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. I do not \r\nmean only regular, largely formal meetings of their \r\nrespective presidents. We need to strive to achieve \r\nsubstantial and meaningful cooperation among the \r\nmain United Nations bodies in areas of mutual interest \r\nso as to ensure complementarity and synergy in their \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n23 07-59704 \r\n \r\nactions. We strongly believe that, instead of blaming \r\nthe Security Council for taking up certain thematic \r\nissues, the other bodies should also be actively engaged \r\nin addressing those issues within the competencies \r\nentrusted to them by the Charter of the United Nations.  \r\n Finally, I would like to convey my delegation’s \r\nappreciation to Ambassador Marty Natalegawa of \r\nIndonesia, the current President of the Security \r\nCouncil, for his comprehensive introduction of the \r\nCouncil’s annual report to the General Assembly. We \r\nare pleased to note that this year’s annual report \r\nfollows an approach aimed at improving the report, \r\nboth in format and in substance, an effort that we have \r\nourselves been very actively involved in. In this \r\ncontext, we also wish, once again, to thank the Chinese \r\ndelegation for its hard work and constructive \r\nleadership in preparing the introduction to this year’s \r\nannual report. \r\n As we have recently said in the formal meeting of \r\nthe Security Council before the adoption of this year’s \r\nannual report, Slovakia strongly believes that the \r\nannual Security Council report to the General \r\nAssembly is a very important document. It should by \r\nno means be just a routine exercise of administrative or \r\nstatistical nature. We believe there is a need — and \r\nalso room — to go further in our efforts in this regard \r\nand to concentrate more on the substance of the report \r\nand on key political messages about the important \r\nwork of the Security Council. This year, we have taken \r\nan important step in the right direction. We hope that \r\nwe will continue in a similar fashion in the future, too. \r\n The issue of the annual report has been among \r\nthe issues discussed in detail this year in the Security \r\nCouncil Informal Working Group on Documentation \r\nand Other Procedural Questions, which Slovakia has \r\nbeen chairing this year. Also, our efforts in the \r\nWorking Group have been concentrated on full \r\nimplementation of the Note by the President of the \r\nSecurity Council of 19 July 2006 (S/2006/507), which \r\nwas prepared last year under the able Japanese \r\nchairmanship of the Working Group. Although this job \r\nis far from done, we are encouraged by the level of \r\ntangible progress in the implementation of the \r\npresidential note that has been achieved this year, \r\nincluding numerous practical documentation and \r\nprocedural issues. We are committed to even further \r\nintensifying our efforts in this area with a clear goal in \r\nmind, namely, making the Security Council more open, \r\nmore transparent and more effective, as well as \r\nenhancing the continuous interactions and dialogue \r\nbetween the Security Council and the United Nations \r\nMember States. \r\n Mr. Romero-Martínez (Honduras) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation, Honduras, as other \r\ndelegations have done, expresses its thanks to \r\nAmbassador Natalegawa, Permanent Representative of \r\nIndonesia, for his introduction of the report of the \r\nSecurity Council covering the period from 1 August \r\n2006 to 31 July 2007. We have on other occasions had \r\nan opportunity to state that our country supports any \r\nattempted change that will update the work of the \r\nCouncil. It is our position that all United Nations \r\nbodies have to be more democratic and more \r\nparticipatory and should be designed to reflect a reality \r\nthat is now rather distant from the arrangements that \r\nwere conceived in their time as being appropriate and \r\ninnovative.  \r\n Honduras, which is one of the original signatory \r\ncountries of the Charter, attaches great importance to \r\nSecurity Council reform. For this reason, we have \r\nshared and sympathized with some positions that seek \r\nto incorporate geographical representation for Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, as well as Africa and other \r\ncountries, which we believe would make the body \r\nentrusted with the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security more balanced. \r\n In this regard, we believe that the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group that functioned during the last session \r\ndid excellent work that should serve as guidance for \r\nthe new tasks ahead of us. We recognize the great \r\ncontribution of the facilitators and we share their \r\nworries and hopes. Their inputs have enriched our \r\nwork. So, as more than one delegation has said before, \r\nthe mechanics of their discussion and analysis should \r\nremain valid in the upcoming discussions that we shall \r\nhave on this question. \r\n We believe that adequate coordination between the \r\nSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council and \r\nthe General Assembly is indispensable and vital. It is \r\nimportant to maintain the balance between the functions \r\nand powers of the main bodies of the United Nations. \r\nThere should be proper collaboration and coordination \r\nthat includes interrelationship and interdependence. We \r\nbelieve that all Member States agree with the issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform and have invested many years \r\nworking on that issue. We must make progress and \r\naddress reform in greater depth. The current world \r\nA/62/PV.50  \r\n \r\n07-59704 24 \r\n \r\nsituation demands that of us, and reality has imposed \r\nnew criteria and values upon us.  \r\n All of us wish to see an organization that will \r\nkeep pace with the rhythm of the times in which we \r\nlive, an organization that over the years refines its \r\nactions in promoting the legitimate causes of our \r\npeoples. We all wish to see a Security Council that \r\nreflects the modern world and that will incorporate \r\nimportant recommendations to strengthen its work. We \r\nappreciate the work done and are sure there is full \r\nagreement on the need for reform. So let us accomplish \r\nthat task on behalf of our nations and our peoples and \r\nin harmony with the Charter in order to reaffirm faith \r\nin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth \r\nof human beings, in the equal rights of men and women \r\nand of nations large and small. \r\n Mrs. Dibaco (Ethiopia): My delegation wishes at \r\nthe outset to associate itself with the statement made \r\nby Angola on behalf of the African Group. My \r\ndelegation would also like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation to the President of the Security Council \r\nfor the month of November, Ambassador Marty \r\nNatalegawa of Indonesia, for presenting to the General \r\nAssembly the annual report of the Security Council. \r\n The report of the Security Council, as contained \r\nin document A/62/2, is comprehensive and enables the \r\nAssembly to have a full picture of the activities carried \r\nout by the Council from August to July of this year. \r\nThe statistics provided in the Council’s report show a \r\ngrowing trend in its activities. In that regard, the report \r\nis informative and beneficial, although it would be \r\nmore desirable to include an analysis of the Council’s \r\nactivities. We hope that in the future the report will be \r\nmore analytical and will better reflect the issues dealt \r\nwith by the Council in a substantive manner. We also \r\nhope that the report will be available in advance, so \r\nthat the Assembly will have ample time to examine the \r\nissues and make meaningful contributions. Likewise, \r\nwe expect that the format of the report will be \r\naddressed by taking into consideration the views \r\nexpressed during the present debate. \r\n The issue of Security Council enlargement and \r\nthe principle of equitable representation are of critical \r\nimportance to the overall reform of the United Nations. \r\nThis overriding fact necessitates that the issue should \r\nbe accorded the necessary attention and importance it \r\ndeserves. \r\n As it is well known, during the sixty-first session \r\nof the General Assembly, there were, on and off, \r\nattempts to provide momentum to the issue and keep it \r\nalive through formal and informal consultations among \r\nMember States and stakeholders. In that respect, my \r\ndelegation appreciates the efforts of the Ambassadors \r\nof Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Liechtenstein, Netherlands \r\nand Tunisia for conducting continuous consultative \r\nmeetings to exchange views on how to proceed with \r\nthe reform process and make progress. Their reports \r\nhave also been useful for building on what has been \r\nachieved and for continuing the consultations from \r\nwhere they left off. We expect the President of the \r\ncurrent session to devote the necessary attention to the \r\nconsultations by issuing appropriate guidance and \r\ndirection, so that the issue will maintain momentum \r\nuntil solutions that are acceptable to all stakeholders \r\nare found. \r\n Ethiopia firmly believes that the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council is vital to its capacity to act and its \r\nability to deliver results. In that regard, improvement \r\nin the working methods of the Council is equally \r\nimportant. We firmly believe that, whatever \r\nconsultations are intended to be conducted in the \r\nfuture, should be on the basis of transparency and \r\ninclusiveness. The interests of the various stakeholders \r\nin the issues should also be taken fully into account \r\nand deserve equal consideration. We hope that the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group and others involved in \r\nfacilitation tasks will give due recognition to that \r\naspect of the consultation process and act accordingly. \r\n In conclusion, we wish once again to stress the \r\nneed for the reform of the Council to be accorded high \r\npriority during the current session. Ethiopia, as in the \r\npast, will continue to closely follow the issue and \r\nengage in consultations aimed at making progress and \r\nachieving tangible results through consensus. \r\n Mr. Verbeke (Belgium) (spoke in French): Please \r\nallow me to make a few procedural remarks. Some \r\nhave described the Security Council as one of the most \r\nconservative institutions in the world, referring to its \r\nworking methods, its procedures and, above all, its \r\nmembership. Others have called the Security Council \r\none of the most effective organs of the United Nations. \r\n As a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil, Belgium observes each day that there is a \r\ngrain of truth in both assertions. It follows — and this \r\nis my first comment — that any Security Council \r\n A/62/PV.50\r\n \r\n25 07-59704 \r\n \r\nreform will have to take into account two basic \r\nelements — the Council must adapt while ensuring that \r\nits effectiveness is maintained. In that connection, \r\nimprovement in the working methods of the Council is \r\ncertainly an important objective. Initial progress has \r\nalready been achieved, but there still remain \r\nconsiderable challenges, especially regarding access to \r\nthe Council by non-member countries, in particular \r\nthose countries directly concerned by Council \r\ndecisions. Other speakers before me have already \r\nraised that point, so I will not dwell on it. \r\n Improving working methods, however important \r\nthat may be, is not enough. As several colleagues \r\nemphasized yesterday and today, a further-reaching \r\nreform is necessary, more than ever. Dragging our \r\nheels on the issue would be tantamount to maintaining \r\nthe status quo, which is not an option. The composition \r\nof the Security Council must better reflect the current \r\ngeopolitical reality. Increased representation would \r\nhelp to give the Council greater legitimacy. That \r\nposition seems to be shared by all. The question is, \r\nhow to achieve it and how to break the deadlock. \r\n During the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, as is illustrated in the latest report of the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group, the key parameters for any \r\nSecurity Council reform were clearly identified and I \r\nwish to commend President Al Khalifa and the five and \r\nthen two facilitators for the outstanding work they have \r\ndone in that regard. My delegation believes that, with \r\nthe work done in recent months, the political leeway and \r\nthe legal requirements are sufficiently well-known.  \r\n It is now time to go on to the next phase: a phase \r\nof genuine intergovernmental negotiations within the \r\nGeneral Assembly itself, the natural venue for such a \r\nprocess. The modalities for those intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations should be defined as soon as possible.  \r\n For Belgium, as was stated by our Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs to the General Assembly on 1 October \r\n(see A/62/PV.12), it is clear that in due course, \r\nconsultations at the highest level — at the level of \r\nheads of State or Government, in capitals — will be \r\ninevitable if we wish to attain tangible results. My \r\ndelegation believes that such consultations should be \r\nconducted by a single individual who would enjoy our \r\nfull confidence: a high-level special envoy.  \r\n For Belgium, that does not mean outsourcing the \r\ndebate from New York to various capitals, but rather \r\nensuring the ownership, the active and direct \r\ninvolvement of our heads of State and Government in a \r\ndebate, the strategic issues of which are known to all. \r\nIn that way the special envoy would be acting as a \r\ncatalyst who, supported by direct contributions from \r\ncapitals at the highest level, would be in a position to \r\nunjam, facilitate, promote and speed up the process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiation.  \r\n On the basis of contact and consultations \r\nconducted directly with capitals, the special envoy \r\nshould be in a position to submit to us a consolidated \r\nproposal that would enjoy the broadest possible \r\nsupport. That proposal would constitute the basis for a \r\nnew round of intergovernmental negotiations within \r\nthe General Assembly. It is for the General Assembly, \r\nand to the General Assembly alone, to take the final \r\ndecision, which should take place before the end of its \r\nsixty-second session.  \r\n The debate on the reform of the Security Council \r\nhas already taken up a great deal of time and energy. \r\nOnly an innovative procedural approach can break the \r\ndeadlock in which we currently find ourselves on this \r\nissue. Belgium is prepared to play its role. \r\n \r\nOrganization of Work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I would like to inform \r\nmembers that as the first item on Thursday, \r\n15 November, the General Assembly will take up \r\nagenda item 48, “Integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic and social and related fields”, and agenda \r\nitem 116, “Follow-up to the outcome of the \r\nMillennium Summit”, for the purpose of taking action \r\non draft resolution A/62/L.11, entitled “Overview of \r\nUnited Nations activities relating to climate change”. \r\nAlso, I would like to inform members that the \r\nconsideration of agenda item 50, “The role of the \r\nUnited Nations in promoting a new global human \r\norder”, which is scheduled as the fourth item for \r\nThursday morning, 15 November, has been postponed \r\nto Monday morning, 26 November. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m. \r\n"
