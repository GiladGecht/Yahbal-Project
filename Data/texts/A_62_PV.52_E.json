(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10:15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 113 \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and \r\nother elections \r\n \r\n \r\n (a) Election of seven members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/77) \r\n \r\n The President: Pursuant to General Assembly \r\ndecision 42/450 of 17 December 1987 and upon \r\nnomination by the Economic and Social Council, the \r\nAssembly elects the members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination. \r\n The Assembly has before it document A/62/77, \r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee \r\nthat will occur as a result of the expiration, on  \r\n31 December 2007, of the terms of office of Algeria, \r\nChina, Ghana, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya and the Republic \r\nof Korea. Those States are eligible for immediate \r\nre-election. \r\n I should like to remind members that, after  \r\n1 January 2008, the following States will still be \r\nmembers of the Committee: Argentina, Armenia, \r\nBelarus, Benin, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Central African \r\nRepublic, the Comoros, Cuba, France, Haiti, India, \r\nIndonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Italy, \r\nPakistan, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Senegal, \r\nSouth Africa, Switzerland, Uruguay, the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Therefore, those \r\n25 States are not eligible in this election. \r\n I should now like to inform members that the \r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic \r\nand Social Council: the three African States for three \r\nvacancies are Kenya, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and \r\nNiger; the three Asian States for three vacancies are \r\nBangladesh, China and the Republic of Korea; and the \r\none Latin American and Caribbean State for one \r\nvacancy is Jamaica. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot \r\nand there shall be no nominations. However, I should \r\nlike to recall paragraph 16 of General Assembly \r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing \r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs \r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard, \r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a \r\ngiven election. \r\n In the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the \r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: The number of States nominated \r\nfrom among the African States, the Asian States and \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean States is equal to the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled in each of those groups. \r\n May I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto declare those States nominated by the Economic and \r\nA/62/PV.52  \r\n \r\n07-60012 2 \r\n \r\nSocial Council from among the African States, the \r\nAsian States and the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, namely, Bangladesh, China, Jamaica, Kenya, \r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Niger and the \r\nRepublic of Korea, elected members of the Committee \r\nfor Programme and Coordination for a three-year term \r\nof office beginning on 1 January 2008? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: I congratulate the States that have \r\njust been elected members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination. \r\n Members will recall that from previous sessions, \r\nand as indicated in document A/62/77, there remain \r\ntwo vacancies in the Group of Western European and \r\nother States for members whose term of office would \r\nbegin on the date of election. One term will expire on \r\n31 December 2008 and the other on 31 December \r\n2009. The General Assembly will be in a position to \r\nact on those vacancies upon the nomination by the \r\nEconomic and Social Council of two Member States \r\nfrom that region. \r\n We have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 113. \r\n Mr. Ä°lkin (Turkey), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n (b) Election of twenty-nine members of the \r\nGoverning Council of the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Pursuant to General \r\nAssembly resolution 2997 (XXVII) of 15 December \r\n1972 and Assembly decision 43/406 of 24 October \r\n1988, the Assembly will proceed to the election of \r\n29 members of the Governing Council of the United \r\nNations Environment Programme, to replace those \r\nmembers whose term of office expires on 31 December \r\n2007. \r\n The 29 outgoing members are the Bahamas, \r\nBangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, \r\nCameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana, \r\nHungary, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, \r\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Monaco, Morocco, \r\nNetherlands, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, \r\nSweden, Turkey, Tuvalu, the United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland and the United Republic \r\nof Tanzania. Those States are also eligible for \r\nimmediate re-election. \r\n I should like to remind members that, after \r\n1 January 2008 the following States will still be \r\nmembers of the Governing Council: Algeria, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, \r\nBelgium, Botswana, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, \r\nthe Czech Republic, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, France, Germany, Haiti, Indonesia, Japan, \r\nKenya, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the \r\nRussian Federation, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, \r\nthe United States of America and Uruguay. Therefore, \r\nthose 29 States are not eligible in this election. \r\n As members know, in accordance with rule 92 of \r\nthe rules of procedure, all elections shall be held by \r\nsecret ballot and there shall be no nominations. \r\nHowever, I should like to recall paragraph 16 of \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, whereby the \r\npractice of dispensing with the secret ballot for \r\nelections to subsidiary organs when the number of \r\ncandidates corresponds to the number of seats to be \r\nfilled should become standard, unless a delegation \r\nspecifically requests a vote on a given election. \r\n In the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that \r\nbasis? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: Regarding candidatures, I \r\nhave been informed by the Chairmen of the regional \r\ngroups that for the eight seats from the African States, \r\nthe eight endorsed candidates are Benin, the Congo, \r\nGuinea, Mali, Mauritius, the Niger, Somalia and \r\nTunisia. \r\n For the seven seats from the Asian States, the \r\nseven endorsed candidates are Bangladesh, Fiji, India, \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia \r\nand Tuvalu. \r\n For the three seats from the Eastern European \r\nStates, the three endorsed candidates are Belarus, \r\nCroatia and Hungary. \r\n For the five seats from the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, the five endorsed candidates are the \r\nBahamas, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba and Mexico. \r\n For the six seats from the Western European and \r\nother States, the six endorsed candidates are Finland, \r\nIsrael, Italy, Monaco, the Netherlands and Spain. \r\n Since the number of candidates endorsed by the \r\nAfrican States, the Asian States, the Eastern European \r\n A/62/PV.52\r\n \r\n3 07-60012 \r\n \r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean States and \r\nthe Western European and other States corresponds to \r\nthe number of seats to be filled in each region, may I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to elect those \r\ncandidates as members of the Governing Council of the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme for a four-\r\nyear term of office beginning on 1 January 2008? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: The following 29 States \r\nhave thus been elected members of the Governing \r\nCouncil of the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme for a four-year term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2008: the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Belarus, \r\nBenin, Colombia, the Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia, \r\nCuba, Fiji, Finland, Guinea, Hungary, India, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, \r\nMali, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, the Netherlands, the \r\nNiger, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Spain, Tunisia and \r\nTuvalu. \r\n I congratulate the States that have been elected \r\nmembers of the Governing Council of the United \r\nNations Environment Programme. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish if the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (b) \r\nof agenda item 113?  \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 114 \r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments \r\n \r\n (g) Appointment of members of the Committee \r\non Conferences \r\n \r\n Note by the Secretary-General (A/62/107) \r\n The Acting President: As indicated in document \r\nA/62/107, since the terms of office of Austria, China, \r\nEgypt, Jamaica, Kenya, Nepal and the United States of \r\nAmerica will expire on 31 December 2007, it will be \r\nnecessary for the President of the General Assembly to \r\nappoint, during the current session, seven members in \r\norder to fill the resulting vacancies. Those members \r\nwill serve for a period of three years, beginning on \r\n1 January 2008. \r\n After consultations with the Chairmen of the \r\ngroups of African States, Asian States and Western \r\nEuropean and other States, the President has appointed \r\nAustria, China, Japan, Kenya, Tunisia and the United \r\nStates of America as members of the Committee on \r\nConferences for a period of three years, beginning on \r\n1 January 2008. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly takes note of \r\nthose appointments? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: Regarding the remaining \r\nvacant seat from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, the President will continue to hold \r\nconsultations with that regional group. \r\n We have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (g) of agenda item 114. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 114 (continued) \r\n \r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments \r\n \r\n (a) Appointment of members of the Advisory \r\nCommittee on Administrative and \r\nBudgetary Questions \r\n \r\n Report of the Fifth Committee (A/62/528) \r\n The Acting President: The Fifth Committee \r\nrecommends in paragraph 6 of its report that the \r\nGeneral Assembly appoint the following persons as \r\nmembers of the Advisory Committee on Administrative \r\nand Budgetary Questions for a three-year term of office \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2008: Mr. Jorge Flores Callejas \r\nof Honduras; Mr. Imtiaz Hussain of Pakistan; \r\nMs. Misako Kaji of Japan; Mr. Jerry Kramer of \r\nCanada; Mr. Peter Maddens of Belgium; Mr. Nagesh \r\nSingh of India. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto appoint those persons as members of the Advisory \r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions \r\nfor a three-year term of office beginning on 1 January \r\n2008?
