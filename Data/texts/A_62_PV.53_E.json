(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nCyclone in Bangladesh \r\n \r\n The President: Before proceeding to the items on \r\nour agenda, I should like, on behalf of all the members \r\nof the General Assembly, to extend our deepest \r\nsympathies to the Government and the people of \r\nBangladesh for the tragic loss of life and material \r\ndamage that have resulted from the recent cyclone. \r\n May I also express the hope that the international \r\ncommunity will show its solidarity and respond \r\npromptly and generously to any requests for their help. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 48 and 116 (continued) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of \r\nand follow-up to the outcomes of the major  \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields \r\n \r\nFollow up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.11/Rev.1) \r\n \r\n The President: I would like to call the \r\nAssembly’s attention to draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.11/Rev.1, in particular that it has also been \r\nissued under agenda item 54, “Sustainable \r\ndevelopment”. \r\n Members will recall that, at the second plenary \r\nmeeting on 21 September 2007, this item was allocated \r\nto the Second Committee for its consideration. If there  \r\nis no objection, the General Assembly will take action \r\non draft resolution A/62/L.11/Rev.1 also under agenda \r\nitem 54. \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take a \r\ndecision on draft resolution A/62/L.11/Rev.1, entitled \r\n“Overview of United Nations activities relating to \r\nclimate change”. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.11/Rev.1? \r\n Draft resolution A/62/L.11/Rev.1 was adopted \r\n(resolution 62/8). \r\n The President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 48 and 116. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 71 and 72 \r\n \r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/324  \r\nand Corr.1) \r\n \r\n (a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations \r\n \r\n Reports of the Secretary-General (A/62/72, \r\nA/62/83, A/62/87 and A/62/323) \r\n \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 2 \r\n \r\n (b) Special economic assistance to individual \r\ncountries or regions \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/310) \r\n \r\n (c) Assistance to the Palestinian people \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/82) \r\n \r\n (d) Strengthening of international cooperation and \r\ncoordination of efforts to study, mitigate and \r\nminimize the consequences of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/467) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.12) \r\n \r\nAssistance to survivors of the 1994 genocide in \r\nRwanda, particularly orphans, widows and victims of \r\nsexual violence \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/310) \r\n \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ukraine to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.12 \r\n Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretariat for the report submitted \r\nunder agenda item 71(d), entitled “Strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination of efforts to \r\nstudy, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster”. \r\n United Nations humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance has been acquiring growing importance in \r\nthe light of an increasing number of humanitarian \r\nthreats and challenges. We proceed from the necessity \r\nto ensure comprehensive and coordinated responses to \r\nhumanitarian situations. It is important to preserve the \r\nfundamental principles of humanitarian assistance — \r\nnamely, neutrality, humanity, impartiality, respect for \r\nsovereignty and the territorial integrity of States. \r\n Ukraine attaches utmost importance to the role of \r\nthe United Nations, particularly that of the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), in the \r\nstrengthening of international cooperation in mitigating \r\nand minimizing the consequences of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster. It is essential to ensure that the United Nations \r\nstrategy for Chernobyl is implemented in an effective \r\nand timely manner. Ukraine strongly believes that, \r\ngiven the scope and magnitude of the Chernobyl \r\ncatastrophe and its severe long-term consequences, this \r\nissue should remain on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly and be considered in plenary in the future as \r\npart of the humanitarian cluster, with a special focus on \r\neconomic assistance. \r\n In a statement, delivered earlier this year, the \r\nPresident of Ukraine, Victor Yushchenko, stressed that \r\nthe Chernobyl issue affected the whole country, and he \r\ninsisted that the polluted zone should be developed, \r\ncalling it \r\n“not only the area of tragedy but also the land of \r\nvast opportunities ... . This territory must not be \r\nforgotten. We want to see this land alive and \r\nrevived”. \r\n The draft resolution before us today (A/62/L.12) \r\nis a platform for further action to optimize the \r\ninternational response to the aftermath of the \r\nChernobyl disaster. This document, based on the \r\nSecretary-General’s biennial report, takes stock of the \r\nprogress made so far and seeks to map out further the \r\nplans for immediate assistance. It recognizes the \r\nimportance of strengthening international cooperation \r\non Chernobyl. \r\n It is essential to emphasize that Member States \r\nwelcome efforts of the international community to \r\ncomplete construction of the shelter facility and related \r\nnuclear safety projects at Chernobyl, in accordance \r\nwith international standards, to transform the site into a \r\nstable and environmentally safe state. \r\n We pay special attention to the proposal by the \r\nUNDP “to coordinate the drafting of a United Nations \r\naction plan for Chernobyl recovery to 2016” in order to \r\nimplement the Decade of Recovery and Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of the Affected Regions, the aim of \r\nwhich is to maximize limited resources, avoid \r\nduplication of effort and build on recognized agency \r\nmandates and competencies. \r\n While cordially thanking all delegations for their \r\nsupport in bringing this draft resolution to consensus, \r\nwe kindly request that delegations consider sponsoring \r\nit as well. \r\n We appreciate the contributions made by all \r\nMember States and organizations of the United Nations \r\nsystem, as well as representatives of civil society, the \r\nprivate sector and the donor community, towards the \r\ndevelopment of cooperation to mitigate and minimize \r\nthe consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n3 07-60309 \r\n \r\n The Government of Ukraine remains fully \r\ncommitted to cooperating with the other two affected \r\nStates, as well as with all international partners, to \r\nmitigate the legacy of the Chernobyl tragedy. \r\n Since the Chernobyl disaster has affected many \r\nparts of the world, it is important that we continue to \r\nstudy its consequences in order to enable humankind to \r\nnever forget the bitter lessons of the past. \r\n Mr. Godinho (Portugal): First of all, I join in the \r\nexpression of sympathy expressed by you, \r\nMr. President, in respect of the recent tragic calamity \r\nin Bangladesh. \r\n I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU). The candidate countries Turkey, \r\nCroatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Serbia, as well as the Republic of Moldova, \r\nArmenia and Georgia, align themselves with this \r\ndeclaration. \r\n The European Union wishes to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the reports submitted for \r\nconsideration under this agenda item. The EU would \r\nalso like to express its solidarity with all those affected \r\nby humanitarian emergencies in the last year. We wish \r\nto pay tribute to the courageous humanitarian field \r\nworkers who risk their lives to bring assistance to those \r\nin need. \r\n Events this year, the most recent being the \r\nhumanitarian and security crisis in the Sudan, and in \r\nthe Darfur region in particular, as well as the crises in \r\nChad and the Central African Republic, have again \r\nhighlighted the importance of an immediate and \r\ncoherent response by the humanitarian community as a \r\nwhole, as well as the need for enhanced cooperation \r\nand collaboration with national and local governments. \r\n The principles of humanity, neutrality, \r\nimpartiality and independence remain the cornerstones \r\nfor the provision of humanitarian assistance, as does \r\nthe need to ensure respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law. \r\nThrough its future consensus on humanitarian aid, \r\nwhich we expect to be endorsed by the end of the year, \r\nthe EU reaffirms that its humanitarian action should be \r\nneeds-based and respect these humanitarian principles. \r\nWe also reiterate our commitment to continued support \r\nfor the central and overall coordinating role of the \r\nUnited Nations in promoting a coherent international \r\nresponse to humanitarian crises. \r\n The issue of access is central to all humanitarian \r\nwork. The lack of access and the obstruction of aid, \r\nincluding bureaucratic obstacles, continue to raise \r\nconcern. We all have a collective responsibility to \r\nguarantee that people in need receive assistance. The \r\nEuropean Union wishes to strongly urge all \r\nGovernments and parties to conflict to ensure rapid, \r\nsafe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance \r\nand protection of affected populations. We also \r\ncondemn attacks against humanitarian personnel and \r\nonce again call for the need to hold accountable those \r\nresponsible for perpetrating illegal acts. Bringing \r\nperpetrators to justice is vital, and stronger action must \r\nbe taken to end impunity. \r\n The European Union calls for an immediate end \r\nto violence against civilians, including sexual and \r\ngender-based violence. Effective measures for \r\nprevention, as well as for protection of and support to \r\nvictims of gender-based violence, must be put in place \r\nby Member States. In addition, we strongly encourage \r\nthe integration of a gender perspective into \r\nhumanitarian operations. \r\n Regarding refugees and displacement, the EU \r\nnotes with great concern that the number of refugees \r\naround the world has increased this year to almost \r\n10 million. Furthermore, the number of internally \r\ndisplaced persons (IDPs) continues to grow at an \r\nalarming rate, totalling almost 24 million worldwide at \r\nthe moment. We believe that protection of and \r\nassistance to IDPs should be comprehensively \r\nstrengthened. The EU, therefore, welcomes the role of \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees as a cluster — lead in this regard and \r\nlooks forward to further cooperation with the United \r\nNations on this issue. \r\n The EU is committed to the advancement of a \r\nhumanitarian reform agenda for the promotion of a \r\nmore predictable and effective humanitarian response. \r\nThe Union strongly supports the cluster approach and \r\nhopes to see further progress in the rollout of clusters, \r\nboth at the global and field levels, particularly in \r\nongoing emergencies. The cluster system can help \r\nbridge gaps in sectoral capacity, avoid duplication and \r\nimprove response capacity through the pooling of \r\nefforts and resources. In this context, and while \r\nacknowledging that there is always room for \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 4 \r\n \r\nimprovement, we are pleased with the initial feedback \r\nfrom the field and call for a joint effort to inform local, \r\nnational and regional authorities about the operations \r\nand benefits of the cluster approach. We also call on \r\nStates to respond to the final appeal for building global \r\nhumanitarian response capacity launched in April of \r\nthis year. \r\n On a separate point, the humanitarian/resident \r\ncoordinator system is key to a successfully coordinated \r\nhumanitarian response at the country level. The \r\nEuropean Union welcomes recent initiatives which \r\nseek to strengthen the humanitarian/resident \r\ncoordinator system such as the establishment of a \r\nhumanitarian coordinator pool, as well as better \r\nrecruitment and training practices. \r\n Recognizing the benefits of the effective \r\nengagement and coordination of relevant humanitarian \r\nactors, the European Union continues to support and \r\nfurther encourage the establishment of partnerships \r\nwith local actors and non-governmental organizations, \r\nas well as with the International Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Movement. While fully taking into account \r\nthe specificity of actors and their diversity, we consider \r\nthat the interaction and close involvement of NGOs, \r\nfor example, is very important. In effect, \r\nnon-governmental and community-based organizations \r\nare in many cases the first to respond in crises and play \r\na key role in humanitarian response. \r\n The European Union believes that the roles and \r\nresponsibilities of actors in the United Nations system \r\nworking with the transition from relief to development \r\nshould be strengthened, both in natural disaster \r\nsituations and complex emergencies. In that context, \r\nwe believe that the Peacebuilding Commission can \r\nmake an important contribution to a coordinated \r\nresponse by the United Nations to States emerging \r\nfrom conflict, as we have seen in the cases of Burundi \r\nand Sierra Leone. The European Union remains \r\ncommitted to the work of the Commission and looks \r\nforward to further work in defining areas of the added-\r\nvalue it can provide. \r\n On funding, the EU welcomes the upgraded \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund which has played \r\nan important role in enabling quicker and more \r\neffective responses to humanitarian emergencies. We \r\nare pleased to see that over 75 countries have \r\ncontributed to the Fund. The European Union, for its \r\npart, remains committed to the stipulated target of $500 \r\nmillion by 2008. Regarding the United Nations \r\nConsolidated Appeal Process — further efforts must be \r\nmade in order to provide more inclusive and better \r\ncoordinated needs assessments. \r\n Indicators of emerging crises and needs \r\nassessments should be prepared in cooperation with \r\nother humanitarian actors and should be reliable, \r\naccurate and timely. The European Union encourages \r\nfurther improved priority setting, including in the \r\nconsolidated Appeal Process. United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies should also develop common \r\nmechanisms for compiling and reporting more robust \r\ndata on humanitarian needs, on assistance and on the \r\nperformance of humanitarian organizations in meeting \r\ndemonstrated needs through the use of standards and \r\nindicators. Without accurate data and properly assessed \r\nneeds, humanitarian actors will be at risk of not being \r\nable to provide the most suitable and best equipped \r\nresponse to crises. \r\n In recent years, natural disasters have caused \r\nmore victims and devastation than man-made crises. \r\nJust as an example, this year has seen 13 flash appeals \r\nfor natural disasters, which is three more than the last \r\nannual record. According to some statistics, the number \r\nof people threatened by natural disasters increased by \r\nthree times over the last 30 years, and the number of \r\npeople affected by natural disasters has doubled every \r\n10 years. In that respect, we take note of the recent \r\nlaunch in Geneva of the Global Humanitarian Forum \r\nand the intention. in the initial phase of its work, to \r\nfocus efforts on the humanitarian impact of climate \r\nchange. \r\n Events this year, especially in Africa, have once \r\nagain brought to our attention the potential devastating \r\neffects of natural disasters and highlighted the \r\nimportance of an urgent and coherent response by the \r\nhumanitarian community as a whole. For these reasons \r\nand others, the European Union attaches great \r\nimportance to developing and sustaining disaster risk \r\nreduction, preparedness and response capacity at all \r\nlevels. Lessons learned have shown us that, in the \r\naftermath of a disaster, more lives are saved when \r\nresponse teams can deploy immediately, particularly at \r\nthe local and national levels. \r\n To that end, the European Union urges States to \r\nimplement the priorities set out in the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action, as well as to incorporate \r\ndisaster reduction efforts into sustainable development \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n5 07-60309 \r\n \r\nand poverty reduction strategies. Early warning \r\nmechanisms must also be improved and expanded as a \r\nmatter of priority. States must invest more in disaster \r\npreparedness and risk reduction. \r\n As stated in the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nthe impact of heavy flooding in Mozambique in 2007 \r\nwas significantly less than in 2001 thanks partly to \r\nimproved community preparedness, the introduction of \r\nan early warning system and improved national and \r\ninternational coordination, including through the use of \r\nmilitary assets. \r\n Allow me to take special note of the positive \r\nreferences made in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/62/310) to the progress achieved in Rwanda, taking \r\ninto account the special needs of orphans, widows and \r\nvictims of sexual abuse from the Rwandan genocide. \r\nWe also wish to underline the importance of a well-\r\nsupported solid transition from relief to development. \r\n Finally, and on the issue of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster, the European Union is pleased to note that the \r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/62/467) makes reference \r\nto the many efforts and improvements that have been \r\nachieved in the past couple of years. As such, we feel \r\nthat the issue of Chernobyl and the relevant draft \r\nresolution (A/62/L.12) would be more appropriately \r\npursued in the development sphere as opposed to the \r\nhumanitarian cluster where it is currently placed. \r\n The European Union fully accepts the need to \r\nmake the international humanitarian response system \r\nmore predictable and effective. We also encourage \r\nfurther efforts to adhere to the principles and best \r\npractices of good humanitarian donorship. The \r\nEuropean Union will continue to play its part, not only \r\nin responding to emergencies as they occur but also in \r\nstrengthening the international community’s capacity \r\nto respond. \r\n In that regard, we would like to thank the \r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator and the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs for their efforts. \r\nThe past year has posed many challenges to the \r\nhumanitarian community. We have a duty to continue \r\nour collective efforts to improve the effectiveness of \r\nhumanitarian response, always to the benefit of the \r\npeople in need. \r\n Mr. Tsalko (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the Republic of Belarus, I have the honour of \r\nthanking the Secretary-General and the United Nations \r\nfor the report prepared for our consideration, entitled \r\n“Optimizing the international effort to study, mitigate \r\nand minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster” (A/62/467). The information in the report \r\nfully reflects the activities of the international \r\ncommunity on Chernobyl problems, as well as the \r\ncoordinating role of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme. \r\n The report enables us to evaluate the various \r\nelements of the actions taken and the activities \r\nundertaken through international cooperation on \r\nChernobyl and the great number of events that have \r\ntaken place in that sphere over the past two years. Most \r\nimportantly, the report describes the development by \r\nBelarus of a new stage of cooperation on Chernobyl. \r\nThe basic elements of that stage include not emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance but rather comprehensive \r\nrehabilitation of the polluted territory, including \r\nrestoring socio-economic activity and meeting the need \r\nto establish safe living conditions for individuals and \r\nto develop of the regions affected. \r\n The information in the report on the joint \r\nprogrammes carried out by the Republic of Belarus, \r\nagencies of the United Nations system, other \r\ninternational organizations and foreign countries very \r\nconvincingly illustrates the timeliness and \r\neffectiveness of the transition to development.  \r\n Belarus welcomes the beginning of the \r\nimplementation of the initiative to assess \r\nenvironmental and security problems in Eastern \r\nEurope, which includes an international cooperation \r\nproject to study the environmental effects of radiation \r\nfrom the accident by taking advantage of the potentials \r\nof the Polesie State Radiology Preserve and to revive \r\nthe International Chernobyl Research and Information \r\nNetwork. \r\n The Republic of Belarus is very grateful for the \r\nholding, on 28 April 2006, of a special General \r\nAssembly meeting devoted to the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the Chernobyl disaster. That was a further \r\nillustration of the international community’s resolve to \r\nmitigate the consequences of the catastrophe. \r\n Belarus notes with satisfaction that there has been \r\nsteady improvement in living conditions in the region \r\naffected by the catastrophe. Nevertheless, 20 per cent \r\nof the area contaminated by radioactivity is home to \r\nmore than 1.3 million persons — among whom the \r\nincidence of illness is rising, especially thyroid \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 6 \r\n \r\nproblems. The Chernobyl catastrophe has had an effect \r\non all human activity, including in the areas of \r\nproduction, culture, science and the economy. \r\nAgriculture has been especially affected, with 2,640 \r\nsquare kilometers of cropland removed from \r\nproduction. There were 123 sites producing minerals \r\nand other raw materials in the contaminated area. More \r\nthan 2 million cubic metres of timber production has \r\nbeen lost. The demographic situation in the Chernobyl \r\nregion has been severely damaged. These and other \r\nproblems add a heavy burden to our economy. \r\n The environmental and economic rehabilitation \r\nof the most affected areas constitutes our \r\nGovernment’s main concern. More than 1 million \r\nhectares of agricultural land require constant attention \r\nin order to ensure clean foodstuffs that meet norms. We \r\nare also working to improve specialized medical \r\nassistance for those affected by the disaster. Another \r\npriority in our socio-economic policy is gas supply. We \r\nmust also work to supply the affected population with \r\nadequate drinking water and to restore contaminated \r\nsettled areas, where we have to build schools, hospitals \r\nand preschools. We also have to improve the legislative \r\nbasis for minimizing the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster, so as to ensure targeted financial \r\nsupport by the Government and the establishment of \r\nfavourable economic conditions for the development of \r\nthe affected areas. \r\n A planned and systematic approach must be \r\ndeveloped to address those problems. We have \r\ntherefore developed a national programme to overcome \r\nthe consequences of the Chernobyl disaster to cover \r\nthe period 2006-2010. In that regard, the national \r\nbudget will include a line item of $1.6 billion. The \r\nnational Government is now spending about $1 million \r\ndaily to that effort.  \r\n The Republic of Belarus takes note of the fact \r\nthat the provisions of draft resolution A/62/L.12 to \r\nstrengthen international cooperation and the \r\ncoordination of efforts to study, mitigate and minimize \r\nthe effects of the Chernobyl disaster reflect the \r\nconsistent, systematic and constructive approach of the \r\ninternational community to activities aimed at \r\novercoming the consequences of the Chernobyl \r\ncatastrophe. We welcome the appeal by the General \r\nAssembly to the Secretary-General and the United \r\nNations Coordinator of International Cooperation on \r\nChernobyl for continued efforts to enhance the \r\ncoordination of international efforts in this area. \r\n Our country is especially pleased about the \r\npositive reaction and support of the international \r\ncommunity for the proposal of Belarus to designate the \r\nthird decade after Chernobyl as the decade of recovery \r\nand sustainable development of the affected regions \r\nand we welcome UNDP’s initiative to coordinate work \r\non drafting a plan for the decade. That initiative was \r\nproposed by Belarus to ensure planned cooperation on \r\nthe problem of Chernobyl among the Governments of \r\nthe three most affected countries, scientific groups, \r\ninternational organizations and foreign countries. Joint \r\npreparation and implementation of the plan for the \r\ndecade will enable us to avoid duplication of effort and \r\nexpenditure that is inevitable when so many \r\nparticipants are working to study, mitigate and \r\nminimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. \r\n In addition to the decade initiative, the meeting \r\nheld on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nChernobyl disaster also featured an appeal by the \r\nGeneral Assembly for Belarus to join the United \r\nNations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic \r\nRadiation. Unfortunately, this matter has not been \r\ndecided yet. Given the amount of experience and \r\nscientific information that Belarus has accumulated on \r\nthe issue of atomic radiation as a result of Chernobyl, \r\nwe believe that the participation of our experts in the \r\nScientific Committee would be of great use to the \r\nentire international community. \r\n The Republic of Belarus would like to take this \r\nopportunity today to thank all its international partners \r\nfor their support for our country’s activities in \r\novercoming the effects of the Chernobyl disaster. We \r\nexpress the hope that our joint efforts will serve to \r\nminimize the negative consequences of the disaster on \r\nthe lives and health of those in the most affected areas. \r\nIt is also very important to prevent the possibility of \r\nsimilar accidents in the future and to ensure the \r\nenvironmental safety of the planet as a whole. \r\n Mr. Sallam (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nhave the pleasure of thanking the President and the \r\nother members of the Bureau for guiding our work. We \r\nare also grateful to the Secretary-General for the \r\nreports he has provided on the item under discussion \r\non the strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nassistance of the United Nations.  \r\n Human and property losses caused by natural \r\ndisasters and conflicts in recent years, in a number of \r\ndeveloping and developed countries alike, and the \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n7 07-60309 \r\n \r\ninternational response and solidarity that followed to \r\nhelp affected States has led us to believe, without a \r\nshadow of a doubt, in the importance of international \r\nsolidarity and cooperation in order to cope with such \r\ncatastrophes, mitigate their destructive effects and \r\nassist victims to return to normal lives as soon as \r\npossible. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia therefore \r\nreaffirms the central role of the United Nations in \r\ncoordinating and strengthening emergency \r\nhumanitarian and relief assistance in the long term. \r\nSaudi Arabia appreciates the efforts of the \r\nOrganization and all those who work in the area of \r\nhumanitarian assistance.  \r\n We would like to emphasize the need to \r\nimplement the recommendations emanating from \r\ninternational conferences dealing with this issue. That \r\nshould be done through a comprehensive approach that \r\naddresses all stages — beginning with early warning \r\nand including the provision of assistance, \r\nreconstruction and development. It should also include \r\nmeasures to help poorer States to strengthen their \r\nnational capacities and cope with natural disasters and \r\nthe repercussions of war. \r\n Based on its concern to discharge its \r\nhumanitarian responsibilities vis-à-vis victims of \r\ncatastrophes and epidemics, the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia has always contributed to United Nations funds \r\nand programmes entrusted with this mandate. Saudi \r\nArabia has also made additional contributions as needs \r\narose. Direct contributions have been given to the \r\nvictims of disasters in coordination with many \r\nspecialized international organizations. The Saudi Red \r\nCrescent Society had distributed in timely fashion over \r\nthe past three years $361 million for assistance in \r\nproviding humanitarian services. The Society has \r\nacquired distinct experience in this area, and we are \r\nvery proud of it. \r\n The humanitarian aid provided by Saudi Arabia \r\nhas not only been limited to bilateral and direct \r\nchannels and means but has been extended to regional \r\nand international efforts through competent funds and \r\ninternational development institutions. This aid has \r\ntotalled about $24 billion. Saudi Arabia has also \r\ncontributed to international efforts to eradicate poverty \r\nand hunger, including economic and financial \r\nassistance, through various Saudi Arabian funds and \r\nregional and international organizations in the context \r\nof bilateral agreements with developing countries. All \r\nof this is out of our firm conviction that this kind of \r\nemergency and development assistance, which is \r\nbeneficial to all humanity, is indispensable to peaceful \r\ncoexistence and constructive cooperation and \r\nsolidarity. Saudi Arabia has therefore provided \r\nfavourable development assistance in cash and kind, \r\nthrough bilateral channels, totalling over $83.7 billion, \r\nwhich is about four per cent of our gross national \r\nproduct. This is the highest percentage of aid in the \r\nentire world. \r\n Eighty-seven developing countries from all \r\ncontinents have benefited from our assistance. This aid \r\nhas strengthened long-term economic and social \r\ndevelopment, helped rebuild infrastructure and \r\nprovided support for education, health, water, \r\nagriculture, well-drilling, dam-building and other key \r\nsectors. In terms of debt alleviation, Saudi Arabia has \r\ncancelled more than $6 billion worth of debt for the \r\npoorest developing countries. \r\n Addressing with a serious and realistic attitude \r\nthe sense of frustration and despair of citizens of the \r\npoorer countries because of poverty, hunger, disease, \r\nilliteracy and indebtedness, requires us to deepen the \r\nprinciples of humanitarianism, equality, justice and \r\nsustainable development in their health, educational, \r\neconomic and social dimensions. This is all to \r\nstrengthen international peace, stability and security. \r\nThis calls for a genuine partnership and mutual \r\ndevelopment pact between the North and the South.  \r\n In addition to their dire need for official \r\ndevelopment assistance, the indebtedness of the poorest \r\nand medium-income countries should also be \r\naddressed. Foreign direct investment and the transfer of \r\ntechnology to developing countries must be carried out \r\nin a serious fashion in order to liberate international \r\ntrade and ensure international economic growth. \r\n To guarantee the provision of oil, Saudi Arabia \r\nhas increased its production capacity which, as \r\neveryone knows, is a very expensive endeavour. Saudi \r\nArabia has also hosted a forum on energy in Riyadh — \r\na context for negotiation and cooperation between \r\nproducers and consumers in order to stabilize oil \r\nmarkets, since oil is an important strategic product that \r\nis crucial to international economic stability. Saudi \r\nArabia, in this context, is participating, as a signatory \r\nof international instruments to protect the environment, \r\nin every international effort to protect the environment, \r\npositively, within the principles of common \r\ninternational action, including the Kyoto Protocol. \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 8 \r\n \r\n Saudi Arabia is working to ensure that the world \r\ntakes the required measures to protect the environment, \r\non the one hand, while protecting global economic \r\ngrowth on the other. We believe that the continuing to \r\ndevelopment of technology and energy is the key to \r\ncoping with environmental problems, in particular \r\nclimate change. The international community must take \r\nthe necessary measures to confront this problem, in \r\nkeeping with common, but differentiated responsibility, \r\nbetween developed and developing countries, as set out \r\nin the Convention on Climate Change. \r\n Ms. Smith (Australia): The international \r\ncommunity is faced today with a formidable level of \r\ndisasters and emergencies, both in scale and number. \r\nThese humanitarian emergencies wreak havoc on \r\nnations and communities, threatening economic growth \r\nand undermining development, including the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It \r\nis our duty to seek to prevent and respond to \r\nhumanitarian crises. It is also our responsibility to \r\nensure accountability for the impact of our assistance. \r\nAt the same time we are facing new challenges, such as \r\nclimate change, that continue to add complexity to the \r\nplanning and delivery of humanitarian action. \r\n Australia strongly supports the key role of the \r\nUnited Nations in providing leadership and \r\ncoordination of international humanitarian action, \r\nespecially the role of the United Nations Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). We \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s reports on \r\nstrengthening the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations and on \r\nthe Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), both \r\nof which are informing our discussions and \r\nnegotiations at this General Assembly. \r\n We have, on a number of occasions, commented \r\npositively on the humanitarian reform agenda and the \r\nsteps the humanitarian system, under OCHA’s \r\nleadership, have taken to improve the coordination, \r\ncapacity, funding and partnerships that underpin \r\neffective humanitarian action. But we consider it is no \r\nlonger correct to point to the cluster approach, \r\nstrengthening of humanitarian coordinators, and \r\nmechanisms such as CERF as new approaches or \r\nreforms. These are all now integral and fundamental to \r\nhumanitarian action and how the humanitarian \r\ncommunity operates. Lessons are still to be learned and \r\nefforts to improve humanitarian response even further \r\nmust continue. To that end, we look forward to the \r\nindependent review of CERF and external review of \r\nthe cluster approach. \r\n All of us who are engaged in humanitarian action \r\nmust strive to ensure that what we do is as effective as \r\npossible and is based on needs. This requires resources, \r\npeople with the right skills in the right places at the \r\nright time, strong and effective coordination of effort, \r\nappropriate tools, proper accountability and risk \r\nmanagement, and strong and clear leadership. \r\nSupporting this must be the objective of the General \r\nAssembly as well as the Economic and Social Council. \r\n The best response system in the world is useless \r\nif affected communities cannot be reached. \r\nFundamental to saving lives in any emergency is rapid, \r\nsafe and unhindered access by humanitarian personnel \r\nand to goods and services to people in need. Without \r\naccess, lives cannot be saved. This is simply \r\nirrefutable. The safety of humanitarian personnel in \r\nemergency response is also critical. Too many \r\nhumanitarian workers’ lives are lost in the line of duty \r\neach year. We pay tribute to those who have died while \r\nseeking to protect the lives of others. We urge more \r\npractical measures, such as encouraging recipient \r\nStates to work closely with organizations delivering \r\nhumanitarian aid, to facilitate access and to protect \r\nhumanitarian personnel. \r\n Another critical humanitarian issue that requires \r\nour urgent attention is the protection of civilians. \r\nAustralia calls on all Member States and other actors, \r\nespecially in armed conflicts, to prevent violence \r\ncommitted against civilian populations and to \r\neffectively respond if and when such acts occur. \r\nAustralia is particularly concerned that gender-based \r\nviolence, especially sexual violence, continues to occur \r\nat alarming levels in emergency situations. Such \r\nviolence must be prevented and stopped wherever it \r\noccurs or has the potential to occur. Perpetrators of \r\nsuch violence must be apprehended and brought to \r\naccount, and the survivors must be given the care and \r\nsupport that they need and deserve. \r\n Our doctors tell us that prevention is always \r\nbetter and easier than cure. This fact is as true in the \r\nhumanitarian field as it is in health care. Australia \r\nconsiders disaster risk reduction, which includes \r\nprevention, mitigation and preparedness for natural \r\ndisasters, as an important priority for humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment assistance. In this regard, we commend \r\nthe Hyogo Framework for Action and its programme of \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n9 07-60309 \r\n \r\nwork. Implementation of the Hyogo Framework helps \r\nbuild the resilience of nations and communities to \r\ndisasters and advocates for the integration of disaster \r\nrisk reduction into legislation and development \r\nplanning. Building on Hyogo, we welcome the \r\ninaugural meeting of the Global Platform for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction in June of this year. This forum \r\nprovided support for the dissemination of disaster risk \r\nreduction best practices and the promotion of \r\npartnerships among States, non-governmental \r\norganizations and the private sector for developing and \r\nsupporting strategies to implement the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action. We encourage further work in \r\nthis critical area. \r\n Australia is a strong supporter of humanitarian \r\naction and the role of the United Nations therein. We \r\nare active in supporting prevention, risk reduction and \r\nemergency response, and will continue to work to \r\nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of \r\nhumanitarian action. As I said previously, the \r\nhumanitarian challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity are formidable. This reality makes our \r\nefforts to strengthen our ability to respond all the more \r\ncritical. We look forward to working with the United \r\nNations, especially OCHA, and all Member States, as \r\nwe continue to do so. \r\n Mr. Al-Ajran (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Today \r\nwe are discussing an important item on the agenda of \r\nthe General Assembly, namely, “Strengthening of the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance of the United Nations, including special \r\neconomic assistance”.  \r\n During the last year, the United Nations, through \r\nits various specialized agencies, programmes and \r\noffices, has played an outstanding role in facilitating the \r\ntransport and delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance. \r\nWe share the deep concern expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/62/87) regarding the increase in the \r\nnumber and intensity of natural disasters compared with \r\nprevious years, where the damages caused by these \r\ndisasters have led to a direct effect on the lives of 143 \r\nmillion people and economic losses surpassing \r\n$34 billion. We pay our condolences to the Government \r\nand the people of Bangladesh over the latest disaster, the \r\nhurricane that struck Bangladesh, caused thousands of \r\ndeaths and resulted in millions of refugees.  \r\n My country wishes to convey its gratitude and \r\nappreciation to all those providing humanitarian \r\nassistance for all their sacrifices. It also expresses deep \r\nconcern over their targeting and threats aimed at them \r\nin zones of natural disasters and conflict. We call upon \r\nall countries that host humanitarian workers to exert all \r\nnecessary efforts to ensure the safety of these \r\ninternational staff, and also commend the proposal of \r\nthe Secretary-General to set forth preventive plans, \r\nexchange information and conduct risk assessments, \r\nsince such an approach will guarantee the safety of the \r\nUnited Nations staff in the field. \r\n The State of Kuwait is at the forefront of nations \r\nproviding relief assistance to those ravaged by natural \r\ndisasters. This assistance is presented in a direct \r\nbilateral manner with the States or the regions \r\ndevastated, out of its firm belief in the necessity of a \r\nquick response. During the last three years, Kuwait \r\nprovided financial assistance as follows: $250,000 to \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to assist it \r\nin confronting the effects of the flooding of September \r\n2007; $500,000 to assist those affected by the typhoon \r\nYamin, which hit the Sindh and Balochistan regions of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan in July 2007; \r\n$2 million to assist Somalia in combating the effects of \r\nthe flooding of July 2007; $500 million to assist in the \r\nrelief of those affected by hurricane Katrina in the \r\nUnited States; $100 million to those affected by the \r\nearthquake in South Asia; $100 million to the States \r\naffected by the Asian tsunami disaster; and $300,000 to \r\nsome Caribbean States affected by hurricane Wilma in \r\nNovember 2005. \r\n The aid that Kuwait provides is full and \r\ncomplete; no amount is discounted for transport, \r\nhandling and management. In this regard, I also wish to \r\nmention that my country has also contributed the \r\namount of $200,000 to the Central Emergency Relief \r\nFund. Since its establishment, the Fund has responded \r\npromptly to urgent appeals in emergency situations \r\nand, while we commend its performance, we call upon \r\nall States Member of the United Nations to increase \r\ntheir contributions to the Fund in order to achieve the \r\ndesired declared goal of $500 million by 2008. \r\n We affirm the importance of international \r\ncooperation in implementing the commitments made to \r\nthe suffering Palestinian people; that is our \r\nresponsibility. Here, I would like to pay tribute to the \r\nrapid intervention operations by the United Nations, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and the temporary \r\ninternational mechanism, which have spent some $800 \r\nmillion on food, budgetary and monetary support in \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 10 \r\n \r\nemergencies. I would also like to highlight the fact that \r\nmy country continues to extend assistance to the \r\nPalestinians, both directly through the Palestinian \r\nAuthority or through the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. \r\nOur shared international cooperation cannot solve the \r\nproblems of the Palestinian people, and the assistance \r\nis not the ultimate desire of the Palestinians, as long as \r\nIsrael continues its inhumane practices against the \r\nPalestinian people in undermining all efforts made in \r\nthat respect and refuses to transfer the Palestinian \r\ntaxation levies it has collected, except for one transfer \r\nthat took place in 2007. These practices have added to \r\nthe worsening of the situation of the Palestinians. \r\n We affirm the importance of cooperating with the \r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to devise plans of disaster \r\nreadiness at all levels, update existing plans, and \r\nenhance regular training for disasters of the magnitude \r\nof Category 5 hurricane Hugo, which struck in 2005. In \r\nthis regard, we call upon Member States to strengthen \r\ntheir roles and make early warning systems among the \r\npriorities of their national, regional and international \r\nplans for disaster management. \r\n Finally, I wish to indicate that the State of Kuwait \r\nwill continue to provide bilateral assistance through the \r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies in order to \r\nconfront disasters and help rebuild through the efforts \r\nof some national development institutes, such as the \r\nKuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and \r\nother Kuwaiti charitable organizations and \r\nassociations. We look forward to a world where \r\neveryone lives in security, stability and prosperity. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): First, I would like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for the reports provided \r\nfor this important session of the General Assembly. On \r\nbehalf of the Government of Iceland, I would like to \r\noffer our sincerest condolences to the countries that \r\nhave experienced humanitarian emergencies. At this \r\nvery moment, our thoughts are with the people of \r\nBangladesh. I express our deepest sympathy to and \r\nsolidarity with the families of the victims and all those \r\naffected. \r\n The international community learned important \r\nlessons in the aftermath of the devastating tsunami in \r\nthe Indian Ocean in 2004. But we also learned that \r\nreform of the humanitarian response was urgently \r\nneeded. We learned that available funds, impact \r\nevaluation, needs assessment and effective \r\ncoordination of actions of the many important actors in \r\nhumanitarian assistance are crucial elements for \r\nachieving the best results.  \r\n We welcome the improvements that have already \r\nbeen made in humanitarian response, in which the \r\nUnited Nations has a leadership role. We also \r\nemphasize the need to continue on that path.  \r\n We thank the Secretary-General and the Joint \r\nInspection Unit for the recommendations made for \r\nreform, which provides a good basis for our work. I \r\nwish to underline that gender mainstreaming should be \r\nconsidered as a cross-cutting issue from the earliest \r\nstages of any reform. \r\n Governments have an important role to play in \r\nensuring availability of funds. We all know that \r\nextensive delays in getting humanitarian assistance to \r\nthose in need can prove to be disastrous. For that \r\nreason, predictable, fast and sound funding in the wake \r\nof humanitarian disasters is of the essence.  \r\n The establishment of the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund has been very successful. It can \r\nprovide a reliable source of financing that helps \r\nagencies on the ground to deal with problems quickly. \r\nIt is likely that the need for funds will increase, and \r\nGovernments have to intensify their efforts. We look \r\nforward to the pledging conference to be held in \r\nDecember. \r\n Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a \r\nsignificant part in humanitarian and development work. \r\nThe Government of Iceland has, therefore, decided to \r\ndouble its contributions in 2008 allocated to \r\nhumanitarian and relief operations through Icelandic \r\nNGOs and the Red Cross. The private sector is also an \r\nimportant player in building up economic growth. We \r\nplan to explore further innovative ways of working \r\nwith the private sector in developing countries. The \r\nGovernment seeks to harness the energies and \r\nefficiencies of NGOs and the private sector, strengthen \r\nthe pioneering work that they are doing and raise \r\npublic awareness of the situation in the poorest parts of \r\nthe world. \r\n I would like to turn briefly to the issue of \r\nassistance to the Palestinian people. I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/62/82) on the issue, \r\nwhich provides a good overview of the situation and \r\nunderlines the need for continued, and indeed \r\nincreased, assistance. The report highlights the role of \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n11 07-60309 \r\n \r\nwomen. We all know that there are strong links \r\nbetween women’s empowerment and poverty reduction \r\nin general, as has been said so often. In cases of \r\nhumanitarian crisis, women and children are not only \r\nthe principal victims; women and girls are also \r\nparticularly vulnerable to various forms of abuse. We \r\ntherefore welcome the intensified emphasis in the \r\nreport on protection of women, children and other \r\nvulnerable groups in crises. \r\n In our debates within this institution we should be \r\ncareful not to lose sight of the purpose of our work. \r\nWhat are the reasons behind the effort? As the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council \r\nresponsible for the humanitarian affairs segment this \r\nyear in Geneva, I have been fortunate to have an \r\nopportunity to work closely with very efficient experts \r\non the issue, both representatives from Member States \r\nas well as from the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs and other humanitarian actors. I \r\nwas impressed to learn how they focus more on the \r\nwhy and less on the how — for example, which version \r\nof a text to use. They realize that we are here to help \r\npeople in need and that we are here to save lives and \r\nhelp people to survive disasters, and that the means \r\nshould not become the end. If we all continue to do our \r\nwork in this positive spirit, we will make a difference. \r\n Mr. Baum (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank the Secretariat for the documents it \r\nhas prepared for our discussions.  \r\n My delegation would like to reiterate here its \r\nsupport for a clear division of labour between the \r\ndebates of the General Assembly and those of the \r\nhumanitarian segment of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n Preserving the ambit for humanitarian action is a \r\nprerequisite for humanitarian assistance. However, \r\ntoday we are seeing a shrinking of that space. Local \r\nand international staff of neutral and impartial \r\nhumanitarian organizations have paid a heavy toll in \r\nhuman life this year. Similarly, speedy, comprehensive \r\nand unimpeded access to people affected by disaster or \r\nconflict remains inadequate and unsatisfactory in many \r\nrespects.  \r\n A humanitarian environment is not a given and \r\nhas to be negotiated and secured through a joint effort \r\non the part of all stakeholders involved, especially in \r\ncomplex emergency situations. International law — \r\nand above all the Geneva Conventions and their \r\nadditional protocols — as well as the Convention on \r\nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel \r\nand its Optional Protocol, include essential norms \r\nregulating the arena for humanitarian action. \r\nUnfortunately, those obligations are too often ignored. \r\n Switzerland encourages the Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator to support efforts to preserve the space for \r\nhumanitarian action by actively facilitating access to \r\naffected areas for operational organizations. We \r\nstrongly urge all States and parties to armed conflicts \r\nto honour their obligations, authorize speedy and \r\nunimpeded passage of all relief consignments, \r\nequipment and personnel, protect civilian populations \r\nand ensure the safety of humanitarian personnel. We \r\nalso underscore the unique nature of United Nations \r\nhumanitarian assistance, which should continue to be \r\nindependent, neutral and impartial. \r\n The reform of the United Nations humanitarian \r\nsystem, which began two years ago, has produced some \r\nencouraging results. However, efforts to sustainably \r\nbolster the capacity and effectiveness of the United \r\nNations system on the ground in all types of emergency \r\nand under whatever administrative structure — \r\nwhether that of a resident or humanitarian coordinator \r\nor, in the case of integrated missions, a special \r\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General — must be \r\nredoubled. We also want this process put in a wider \r\ncontext. The strengthening of the coordination of \r\nUnited Nations emergency aid is a subject that \r\nprecedes this reform, and that will remain at the centre \r\nof our concerns in the future. \r\n The international humanitarian system is \r\ncomprised of several components that are both \r\nindependent of and complementary to United Nations \r\nagencies — such as local and international non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the members of the \r\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. \r\nIn that regard, we are pleased that the organizers of the \r\nthirtieth International Conference of the Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent, which will be held in Geneva from 26 to \r\n30 November, have chosen “Together for humanity” as \r\nthe theme for that important meeting.  \r\n Although the reforms of the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian system initiated two years ago provide \r\nclear guidance for improving operational aspects of \r\nhumanitarian coordination, there is much less clarity as \r\nregards the normative evolution of humanitarian \r\npolicies and principles since the adoption of resolution \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 12 \r\n \r\n46/182. An analytical evaluation of the normative \r\nframework for humanitarian coordination may help us \r\nto identify priority areas to focus on, including as \r\nregards future resolutions of the General Assembly. \r\nSuch prioritization will make it possible to improve the \r\nrelevance and impact of resolutions addressing \r\nhumanitarian issues. \r\n In a world of ever-changing vulnerabilities and \r\nrisks, the strengthening of national disaster-\r\npreparedness capacities deserves particular attention. \r\nIn keeping with the commitments set out in the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action 2005-2015, all participants in \r\nthe International Strategy for Disaster Reduction — \r\nincluding Governments, regional organizations, the \r\nSecretariat and the agencies of the United Nations, the \r\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the \r\ninternational financial institutions, non-governmental \r\norganizations and the private sector — must act swiftly \r\nand together to help to attain the objective of reducing \r\nfor the long term the losses caused by disasters. \r\n Mr. Voto-Bernales (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nshould like to thank the Secretary-General in particular \r\nfor the report submitted in document A/62/87, which \r\nwill be very useful in our discussions.  \r\n At the outset, I wish to indicate that Peru firmly \r\nsupports United Nations efforts to strengthen the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian assistance and disaster \r\nrelief. Such efforts should be based on, inter alia, the \r\nfollowing pillars: observance of the principles of \r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality in providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance; adherence to international law \r\nin the work of humanitarian personnel and United \r\nNations and associated personnel; and protection when \r\nany act or failure to act hinders or prevents the \r\nperformance of their humanitarian functions. \r\n In that connection, I should like to highlight a \r\nnumber of strategic guidelines that my delegation \r\nconsiders fundamental. First, we must take a \r\ncomprehensive and systematic approach. Secondly, we \r\nmust promote a culture of timely and unrestricted early \r\nwarning. Thirdly, we must improve rapid-response \r\ncapacities, recognizing the key advantages of local \r\nactors, who are closest to disasters. Fourthly, we need \r\npreventive measures, including public education \r\nactivities, as well as preparation, mitigation and \r\nrecovery efforts and programmes aimed at, inter alia, \r\nrehabilitation, reconstruction, restoring authority and \r\nthe rule of law, developing sustainable ways to make a \r\nliving and establishing conditions that promote \r\ndevelopment. Fifthly, we must promote North-South \r\nand South-South cooperation, participation by experts \r\nand the transfer of practical technology and knowledge. \r\nSixthly, we must define the respective roles of States, \r\nthe Organization and its relevant organs, other \r\ninternational organizations — including the \r\ninternational financial institutions — regional \r\norganizations, local Governments, communities, the \r\nmilitary, experts, non-governmental organizations, the \r\nbusiness community and the media, among other civil \r\nsociety actors. We must also improve their capacities. \r\n We agree with the report’s diagnosis of the \r\ncurrent world situation. Indeed, the increasingly \r\ndevastating effects of disasters are due to a real \r\nincrease in the number of natural events and to the \r\nincreased exposure and vulnerability of populations to \r\nthe destructive effects of disasters. Climate change, \r\nswift and unplanned urbanization and greater \r\npopulation density, inter alia, are contributing to that \r\ntrend. In that connection, if we are to break the new \r\nvicious circle of constant human and material losses, \r\nenvironmental and social degradation and increasing \r\nvulnerability, we believe it essential, as indicated in the \r\nreport, that the international community work towards \r\na disaster management approach that addresses the \r\ninterconnectedness of threats and vulnerabilities. \r\n In part III of the report, on enhancing the \r\neffectiveness of needs-based humanitarian assistance, \r\nit is indicated in section D, on broadening humanitarian \r\npartnerships, that private companies have continued to \r\nemerge as important relief partners. Our country, Peru, \r\ncan attest to that. As a result of the earthquake that \r\noccurred on 15 August of this year, we witnessed the \r\nbroad and generous mobilization of the entire \r\npopulation, but particularly of private companies, \r\nwhich played a key role in providing materials, food \r\nand assistance in the first moments of the emergency. \r\nIn that regard, we agree with the report, which points \r\nout that as the private sector becomes an increasingly \r\nimportant partner, efforts must be made to adapt the \r\nUnited Nations regulatory environment to facilitate \r\npublic-private partnerships.  \r\n Finally, we wish to express our agreement with \r\neach of the points set out in the conclusions contained \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, particularly \r\nregarding the need to organize regional responses to \r\ndisasters. Accordingly, we should like to highlight the \r\nproject Support for Disaster Prevention in the Andean \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n13 07-60309 \r\n \r\nCommunity, which is the outcome of a financial \r\nagreement signed in 2003 by the European Union and \r\nthe General Secretariat of the Andean Community. Its \r\noverall objective is to help reduce the vulnerability of \r\npersons and property exposed to the dangers and risks \r\nof natural disasters and to promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the countries of the Andean \r\nCommunity. It is included in the regional disaster \r\nprevention and management policies reflected in the \r\nAndean disaster prevention and management strategy \r\nand the corresponding strategic plan for 2005-2010. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to express once again the \r\ngratitude of the Government of Peru to the Resident \r\nCoordinator of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme in Lima and, through him, to all relevant \r\nagencies of the United Nations system for the \r\ninvaluable assistance provided in so many ways when \r\nthe earthquake struck the southern part of my country \r\non 15 August. \r\n Mrs. Thakur (India): I come from the land of \r\nGautam Buddha, Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma \r\nGandhi, all of whom stood for the essential oneness of \r\nall human beings, which is the ethical basis for the \r\nUnited Nations and its humanitarian assistance. I am \r\ntherefore pleased to participate in this debate today. \r\n We thank the Secretary-General for the reports \r\nthat have been prepared for the discussions on this \r\nagenda item. We note the factual nature of the reports, \r\nwhich identify some areas for improvement. We \r\nrequest the Secretary-General to enhance the analytical \r\ncontent of future reports. \r\n All countries are vulnerable to disasters. Nations \r\ncan, and indeed must, cooperate to find collective and \r\ncooperative solutions to the challenges that disasters \r\nrepresent. It is therefore heartening that, in recent \r\nyears, Member States have come together to promote a \r\nmore responsive, prompt, fair and needs-based \r\nhumanitarian assistance system. \r\n India welcomes the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund (CERF) as a non-political collaborative \r\ninstrument that supports developing countries in times \r\nof need. India demonstrated its support for CERF by \r\npledging a contribution of $2 million to the Fund at its \r\nlaunch in New York last year; those funds have already \r\nbeen disbursed. Our contribution was a sign of \r\nsolidarity with international efforts aimed at addressing \r\nthe needs of developing countries for emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance. It reflected our conviction \r\nthat, through this reform measure, the United Nations \r\nwould be better able to assist developing countries in \r\nthe aftermath of a disaster by making resources \r\navailable in a timely and predictable manner, and by \r\nallocating them evenly across emergencies. It is \r\nthrough the Fund’s performance and even-handed \r\napproach to requests for assistance that it will continue \r\nto attract the support of Member States and donors. It \r\nis therefore extremely important that CERF retain a \r\nhigh degree of performance and credibility. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on CERF \r\n(A/62/72) states that the Fund has promoted early \r\naction and response to reduce loss of life, and that \r\nprogress has been made towards achieving its \r\nobjectives. The report provides details of the \r\nexpenditures from CERF. It would also be useful to \r\nknow, in tabular form, the details of all requests \r\nreceived for funding, the proportion of funding \r\nprovided in each case and the criteria used for the \r\nallocations. We look forward to such detailed and \r\nanalytical information in the forthcoming independent \r\nreview that will examine the functioning of CERF over \r\nits first two years. \r\n In handling disasters, it is important to have \r\ncoherent national strategies and national capabilities to \r\nhandle both disaster prevention and disaster \r\nmanagement. The development of necessary national \r\ncapabilities must be the starting point of a disaster \r\nmanagement strategy. India has a forward-looking \r\napproach to disaster management and mitigation. We \r\nhave constituted a National Disaster Management \r\nAuthority, chaired by the Prime Minister and state-\r\nlevel disaster management authorities. The Authority \r\nhas come forward with a new approach to disaster \r\nmanagement that is based on moving away from a \r\nrelief-centric, post-event approach in favour of a \r\nholistic, integrated preventive approach. The focus will \r\nbe on disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation. \r\nImproved coordination among various agencies of the \r\nGovernment is a first step in the new approach. Greater \r\nawareness within civil society about prevention, \r\nmitigation and preparedness is the next important step, \r\nbearing in mind that lack of information and \r\nuncoordinated responses hamper relief efforts. \r\n While there is no substitute for effective national \r\nefforts, a national response alone can sometimes be \r\ninadequate. There is a need for more bilateral, regional \r\nand international cooperation to deal with disasters and \r\nto make effective use of our capabilities. Greater \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 14 \r\n \r\ncooperation in relief and rehabilitation, in disaster \r\npreparedness and in setting up and maintaining early \r\nwarning systems should be a part of the overall effort \r\nto deal with disasters. Through CERF, we have \r\nestablished a more reliable mechanism for saving lives \r\nafter a disaster and addressing the needs of \r\nunderfunded emergencies. However, greater efforts are \r\nrequired for disaster prevention, risk reduction and \r\nearly warning so as to reduce the number of lives lost \r\nto disasters.  \r\n Disaster risk reduction should be based on \r\nproactive and pre-emptive action. Small investments in \r\nimproving the safety of houses, for example, can \r\nreduce the risk of damage to life and property arising \r\nfrom earthquakes. Valuable lives and property can be \r\nsaved through the use of appropriate housing \r\ntechnologies in earthquake-prone areas. India is \r\ndeveloping affordable technologies of this kind. The \r\ninternational community should address the need for \r\ninformation-sharing in such technologies that would \r\nhelp prevent disasters. This approach would be a useful \r\nway of addressing the challenge of risk reduction. \r\n Another intervention relates to low-cost insurance \r\nagainst risk. The penetration of insurance in most \r\ndeveloping countries is still very limited. There is a \r\nneed for a proactive approach in insuring the risk-\r\nprone regions through an approach that can spread the \r\ncosts and ensure the financial sustainability of risk \r\ninsurance mechanisms. \r\n There is also a far greater need for focus on \r\nrecovery and development after a disaster. A strong \r\nrecovery effort that builds back better and pays due \r\nattention to disaster prevention builds resilience to \r\nfuture disasters. India contributes to the efforts of the \r\nGroup of 77 to highlight this issue by coordinating an \r\nannual draft resolution on international cooperation on \r\nhumanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, \r\nfrom relief to development. We hope that greater \r\nattention will be paid to post-disaster recovery, which \r\nstrains the capacities of most developing countries in \r\nthe post-relief period. \r\n We take note of the report’s assessment regarding \r\nimproving the delivery of United Nations humanitarian \r\nassistance, including through the improvement of \r\nUnited Nations coordination activities at the field \r\nlevel. The report highlights the cluster leadership \r\napproach as an effort in this direction. We believe that \r\nthere is a need for an evaluation of this approach to \r\nassess its impact on improving delivery of \r\nhumanitarian assistance, particularly its timeliness, the \r\nadditional expenditure that it entails and the \r\nperspective of the receiving countries where this \r\napproach has been implemented so far. This approach \r\nshould be implemented at the country level with the \r\nconsent and under the leadership of the national \r\nGovernment of the affected State. \r\n India believes that humanitarian assistance must \r\nbe provided in accordance with the principles of \r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality, as contained in \r\nthe guiding principles for the provision of humanitarian \r\nassistance contained in the annex to resolution 46/182. \r\nWe recall that the guiding principles require that the \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of \r\nStates be fully respected and that humanitarian \r\nassistance be provided with the consent of the affected \r\ncountry and, in principle, on the basis of an appeal by \r\nthe affected country.  \r\n All humanitarian personnel, including those \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, must observe \r\nthe national laws of the countries where they are and \r\nmust remain sensitive to the customs and traditions of \r\nthe host State. They must function in a transparent \r\nmanner and carry out their assistance-related activities \r\nthrough close consultation and coordination with the \r\naffected Government. That is essential for the \r\ncredibility of international humanitarian assistance. \r\n In accordance with Indian culture and philosophy, \r\nwe respect all nations and religions. We believe that the \r\nworld is one family. So, before I conclude, please \r\nallow me to wish everyone — all of my family \r\nmembers sitting here — the very best for the coming \r\nfestival season from me and from my country, India. \r\n Mr. Savostianov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Russia attaches great importance to the \r\ndevelopment of the humanitarian discourse in the \r\nUnited Nations. We call for its further strengthening \r\nand enhancement, and for the preservation of the \r\nnon-politicized nature of the endeavour. We support \r\nefforts aimed at establishing an optimal division of \r\nlabour and effective working relationships among the \r\nintergovernmental United Nations bodies involved in \r\nthis process.  \r\n We believe that the General Assembly should \r\nfocus on defining the parameters of the strategic \r\ncoordination of United Nations humanitarian activities, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council on developing the \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n15 07-60309 \r\n \r\npractical aspects of General Assembly decisions and \r\nthe Secretariat on implementing the requests of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. The United Nations Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator should continue to react promptly to the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil requests, paying particular attention to \r\nproviding these bodies with objective information on \r\nthe humanitarian situation around the world.  \r\n In this connection, we take note that, in his recent \r\nreport on strengthening of the coordination of United \r\nNations humanitarian assistance (A/62/87), the \r\nSecretary-General rightly emphasized the importance \r\nof intensified international cooperation in the field of \r\nnational preparedness for natural disasters, with a view \r\nto improving response and recovery capacities in the \r\ncontext of achieving the agreed goals of the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action in the field of disaster risk \r\nreduction.  \r\n There is today a growing demand for disaster \r\npreparedness and early warning mechanisms. We \r\ntherefore support measures aimed at strengthening \r\ncontingency planning and preparing for disasters. We \r\nbelieve it necessary to strengthen national early \r\nwarning, damage assessment and mitigation systems, \r\nand to develop international cooperation to build up \r\nnational capacities in these areas. We support \r\ninternational efforts to promote a global early warning \r\nsystem for natural hazards of all types.  \r\n In our view, a promising area for cooperation is \r\nin the formulation of measures for adaptation to \r\nclimate change. We are carefully studying proposals in \r\nthis area, and we reaffirm our readiness to participate \r\nactively in the formulation of agreed approaches in this \r\nfield.  \r\n The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs is making great efforts to improve humanitarian \r\nresponse to natural disasters, technological \r\ncatastrophes and complex humanitarian emergencies. \r\nOn the whole, we welcome its work. Not everything \r\nhere, however, is clear and transparent. For example, in \r\nthe case of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) \r\nworking in close cooperation with the United Nations \r\nand in partnership with the United Nations, including \r\nin the area of security, and at the same time claiming to \r\nbe independent, it is not clear to whom they are \r\nresponsible and accountable. Independence should not \r\nmean lack of accountability.  \r\n We believe that the United Nations-NGO \r\npartnership agreements can and should provide for \r\nmechanisms of NGO accountability to the United \r\nNations. This is fully consistent with the task of \r\nensuring coherence and coordination in the work of all \r\norganizations involved in humanitarian assistance with \r\nthe leading role played by the United Nations. In the \r\nabsence of accountability, it is difficult to ensure \r\nresponsibility; that could lead to a situation in which a \r\nhumanitarian mandate authorized by a recipient \r\nGovernment, on the basis of which a given NGO \r\noperates in the country, becomes a formal cover-up for \r\nactivities inconsistent with that mandate. Moreover, \r\nthis would undermine the concept of humanitarianism \r\nas the willingness of the strong to help the weak.  \r\n We look forward to the Secretariat’s assessment \r\nof the implementation of the so-called cluster approach \r\nin pilot countries, with an emphasis on the United \r\nNations family’s interaction with non-governmental \r\nhumanitarian organizations in the field.  \r\n The establishment of the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund has proven to be among the most \r\nsignificant results of our common efforts to improve \r\nthe humanitarian response machinery. We welcome the \r\nFund’s activities during the first 18 months of its \r\nexistence in its improved format. We anticipate that the \r\nindependent review of the Fund’s activities will be \r\nissued next year. In that review, particular attention \r\nshould be paid to the criteria for allocation of the \r\nFund’s resources. I would also like to underline that it \r\nwould be useful for the review to reflect the principles \r\nof interaction between the Fund and other United \r\nNations financial mechanisms, in particular the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, through which money is being \r\nchannelled to the recipient countries. From our point of \r\nview, it is essential to avoid duplication of efforts and \r\nto maintain transparency in the criteria for the \r\nallocation of funds.  \r\n The importance of the compromise reflected in \r\nthe fundamental resolution 46/182 cannot be \r\noverestimated. The guiding principles for the provision \r\nof United Nations humanitarian assistance that are \r\nenshrined in it are essential for any activities in this \r\nfield, so as to maintain their credibility for all \r\ncountries.  \r\n Today, the representative of Ukraine introduced \r\nfor action by the General Assembly a draft resolution \r\n(A/62/L.12) on the strengthening of international \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 16 \r\n \r\ncooperation and coordination of efforts to study, \r\nmitigate and minimize the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster. More than 20 years after the \r\ntragedy this problem remains relevant, as its \r\nconsequences continue to seriously affect the health of \r\npeople and the environment, and to hamper the \r\nsustained socio-economic development of the affected \r\nterritories of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.  \r\n The Russian Government’s policy on Chernobyl \r\nis focused on continuous assessment of the radiation \r\nimpact on current programmes for comprehensive \r\nrehabilitation of these territories, to which Russia has \r\nallocated more than $10 billion over the years. The \r\nadoption of the draft resolution by consensus will \r\ndemonstrate the international community’s solidarity \r\nwith the work of the affected countries and its \r\nwillingness to continue devoting the necessary \r\ninternational attention to the Chernobyl problem. \r\n Mrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.  \r\n Traditionally, we acknowledge the special \r\ncatalytic and coordinating role of the United Nations \r\non this issue, in particular that of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). We are grateful to \r\nthe UNDP leadership for the high level of cooperation \r\nthat has been achieved in the implementation of our \r\ncommon objectives, with a view to improving the lives \r\nof people in the affected territories.  \r\n Mr. Amil (Pakistan): It is my privilege to \r\nparticipate in this important joint debate on \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations. We \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his various reports \r\nunder this agenda item.  \r\n Given the multidimensional aspects, I would like \r\nto focus on issues of disaster preparedness and risk \r\nreduction in the context of challenges posed by natural \r\ndisasters. \r\n It is said that those who prepare in advance suffer \r\nless in emergencies. The scale of damage in \r\nemergencies is inversely proportional to the preventive \r\nmeasures taken to deal with them. It takes time to \r\nbuild, but seconds to destroy. It should therefore be our \r\njoint commitment to strengthen capacity at all levels to \r\nreduce the impact of disasters. \r\n As indicated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/62/323), the number and scale of natural \r\ndisasters, particularly in the developing countries over \r\nthe past decade, are on an alarming increase. While we \r\ncannot control the overpowering strength of natural \r\ndisasters, we can reduce their impact and the \r\ndevastation they cause. For that, we need to have in \r\nplace an efficient emergency response system capable \r\nof handling large-scale disasters and mitigating their \r\nnegative impact. I would also like to draw attention to \r\nhumanitarian issues that used to be discussed during \r\nevery General Assembly session. \r\n Vulnerabilities are accentuated in most \r\ndeveloping countries. The poverty-disaster interface \r\nhas the potential for immense suffering and loss. In the \r\nlong term, disasters have an adverse impact on the \r\neconomic and social development of the vulnerable, \r\nespecially the poor. Natural disasters severely impede \r\nprogress towards development goals including the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The 1994 Yokohama \r\nStrategy, the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, and the Hyogo Framework for Action \r\n2005-2015, provide frameworks for swift, systematic \r\nand well-coordinated responses to disasters by building \r\nthe resilience of nations and communities to disasters. \r\nIf effectively implemented, those internationally \r\nagreed frameworks could substantially reduce loss of \r\nlife and the impact on the social, economic and \r\nenvironmental assets of communities. \r\n Pakistan welcomes the establishment of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund (CERF). We remain \r\ncommitted to the work of the United Nations, and, \r\naccordingly, we will continue to contribute to the \r\nCERF. \r\n I would also like to share our national experience \r\nin responding to a natural disaster of monumental \r\nproportion. The earthquake that struck Pakistan on  \r\n8 October 2005 wiped out in a matter of seconds what \r\nhad taken many generations to build. That was a wake-\r\nup call for all of us. The world witnessed, minute by \r\nminute, the devastation caused by the earthquake. The \r\nloss of lives, bread-earners, livelihoods and \r\ninfrastructure was unprecedented for us. The entire \r\nPakistani nation came together to alleviate the \r\nsuffering of the victims. The magnitude of the disaster \r\nwas such that without international support we would \r\nhave seen more pain and suffering. We acknowledge \r\nthe outpouring of sympathy and assistance provided to \r\nthe earthquake victims. The United Nations system \r\nplayed an important role in the coordination and \r\nmobilizing of resources. \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n17 07-60309 \r\n \r\n On behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nPakistan, I would like to thank each and every one who \r\nhelped us in the aftermath of the earthquake. \r\n I would now like to focus on some aspects that \r\nreinforced our belief in disaster preparedness. We were \r\nconfronted with a situation where we had to go beyond \r\nthe conventional disaster management model of \r\nresponse, relief and recovery to a more holistic model. \r\nThat model included the processes of hazard \r\nidentification and mitigation, community preparedness, \r\nintegrated response efforts and recovery that had to be \r\nundertaken contiguously within a risk-management \r\ncontext to address issues of vulnerability. \r\n First, we promulgated the National Disaster \r\nManagement Ordinance in December 2006 and \r\nsubsequently established the National Disaster \r\nManagement Commission and Authority. The Prime \r\nMinister of Pakistan heads the National Disaster \r\nManagement Commission, and its members include \r\nsenior representatives from all provinces, leaders of the \r\nopposition in the upper and lower houses of the \r\nParliament and representatives of the armed forces, \r\ncivil society and non-governmental organizations. \r\n Secondly, the National Disaster Risk Reduction \r\nFramework was approved by our Disaster Management \r\nCommission in March this year. We are working \r\ntowards the implementation of priorities identified in \r\nthe National Disaster Risk Management Framework. \r\nThat requires aligning federal and provincial \r\ncoordination structures, capabilities and resources into \r\na unified, all-discipline and all-hazards approach to \r\ndomestic disaster management. For the first time, a \r\ncomplete spectrum of disaster risk management \r\nactivities is brought together to include prevention of, \r\npreparedness for and response to disasters. The system \r\nwill cover all sectors as well as all administrative \r\nlevels of the Government. \r\n From our experience in the post-earthquake \r\nphase, we have learned the following lessons. \r\n First, the integration of disaster risk reduction \r\ninto all sectoral and national development policies and \r\npractices is necessary for achieving sustainable social, \r\neconomic and environmental development. Secondly, it \r\nis important to develop and strengthen institutions, \r\nmechanisms and capacities at all levels, in particular at \r\nthe community level, that can systematically contribute \r\nto building resilience against natural disasters. In most \r\ndisasters, provincial, district and local resources \r\nnormally provide the first line of emergency response \r\nand management support. \r\n Thirdly, the communities play the role of first \r\nresponders in any disaster management and disaster \r\nrisk reduction. Community-based approaches offer \r\nviable solutions for managing and reducing risks and \r\nensuring sustainable development. Fourthly, it is \r\nimportant to build on people’s local knowledge, coping \r\nmechanisms and cultural practices. We are convinced \r\nthat top-down disaster reduction interventions alone \r\nare not sufficient. Fifthly, there is a need for the \r\nsystematic incorporation of risk reduction approaches \r\ninto the design and implementation of emergency \r\npreparedness, response and recovery programmes in \r\nthe reconstruction of the affected areas. \r\n Pakistan welcomes all efforts to strengthen the \r\nwork of humanitarian agencies and the United Nations \r\nin meeting the challenges of natural disasters. In that \r\nregard, we consider that the draft “Declaration relating \r\nto basic tenets of humanitarian action in emergency \r\nsituations”, contained in document A/60/627 of \r\n5 January 2006, is an important contribution to support \r\nprogress in the world’s preparedness to meet \r\nemergency situations. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof Palestine. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Palestine): Before I deliver my \r\nwritten statement, I just want to convey on behalf of \r\nthe Palestinian people and our leadership our deepest \r\ncondolences and to express solidarity with the people \r\nand Government of Bangladesh following the tragedy \r\nthat has befallen them. We are sure that the \r\nGovernment and people of Bangladesh will be able to \r\nsurvive this tragedy and to move on with their own \r\nplans and agenda. \r\n I stand before you today to address a most vital \r\nbasis for continued Palestinian steadfastness towards \r\ntheir future independence and statehood: international \r\nassistance. For decades, international aid has helped \r\nease the suffering and hardships endured by an entire \r\npeople, more than half of whom have lived as refugees \r\nfor nearly 60 years now and the remainder of whom \r\nhave been living for more than 40 years under the \r\nsubjugation of an oppressive foreign military \r\noccupation. The assistance that has been provided over \r\nthe years in the various fields, both through the United \r\nNations and as direct assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople, has helped to alleviate the hardship of scores of \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 18 \r\n \r\nPalestinians and Palestinian families. For countless \r\nothers, it has been the only source of survival and \r\nsustenance throughout endless periods of instability, \r\ncrisis and uncertainty. \r\n While the Palestinian people and its leadership \r\nare deeply grateful for that invaluable assistance, we \r\nbelieve it is imperative to ask ourselves the following \r\nquestions as we convene to discuss this issue today. \r\nHow much have we helped that assistance to reach its \r\nfull potential, and how much sabotage has the \r\ninternational community endured to its sustained \r\nassistance efforts? How many more internationally \r\nfunded projects and efforts are we willing to allow the \r\noccupying Power to undermine and decimate as it \r\ncontinues pursuing its illegal policies and practices and \r\ncontinues deepening the humanitarian crisis, inevitably \r\nforcing that assistance to go off track, from \r\ndevelopment and State-building to relief and crisis \r\nmanagement? How much longer is the international \r\ncommunity willing to pay for the illegal acts of the \r\noccupying Power by relieving the consequences of \r\nthose acts instead of bringing them to an end? \r\n Numbers do not lie, and the latest figures \r\nregarding the humanitarian and economic situation in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, are astounding and tragic. In fact, all recent \r\nreports have documented the enormous burden \r\ninternational agencies are enduring in trying to address \r\nthe continuously emerging needs of the Palestinian \r\ncivilian population and to alleviate the crisis. At the \r\nsame time, all infrastructure projects, industries and \r\nemployment-generation projects have come to a \r\ngrinding halt because of the repressive and unlawful \r\nmeasures imposed by the occupying Power, which have \r\nturned the Palestinian people from a people seeking \r\ndevelopment towards the birth of their future State to a \r\npopulation sinking into abject poverty and struggling to \r\nput food on the table and barely survive. \r\n The latest report by the Economic and Social \r\nCommission for Western Asia on the economic and \r\nsocial repercussions of the Israeli occupation on the \r\nliving conditions of the Palestinian people in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, and \r\nof the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan, \r\nsums up the bleak situation as follows:  \r\n “The Israeli closure system remains a \r\nprimary cause of poverty and humanitarian crisis \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, and restricts \r\nPalestinian access to health and education \r\nservices, employment, markets and social and \r\nreligious networks.” (A/62/75, summary)  \r\n The closures, movement restrictions and the wall, \r\namong other unlawful Israeli measures, have battered \r\nthe economy, destroyed thousands of livelihoods and \r\nmade thousands of families destitute. In that regard, \r\naccording to the International Labour Organization, \r\n7 out of 10 Palestinian households, comprising \r\n2.4 million people, are living in poverty in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory. A report of the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development \r\n(UNCTAD) also addresses the extent of economic \r\ndevastation caused by Israel’s measures to the \r\nPalestinian economy, concluding that the Palestinian \r\neconomy has been reduced to a size smaller than it was \r\na decade ago due to Israeli restrictions on movement of \r\nPalestinian persons and goods. At the same time, the \r\ntrade deficit has reached unprecedented proportions of \r\n73 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), 30 \r\nper cent higher than its 30-year average. The World \r\nBank monitoring report of September 2007 also noted \r\nthat, in 2006 alone, Palestinian GDP contracted by \r\nnearly 8.8 per cent, and by a further 4.2 per cent in the \r\nfirst quarter of 2007. \r\n The picture is of course most bleak in the Gaza \r\nStrip, where Israel’s crippling siege has managed to \r\nbring the entire territory to the verge of collapse — \r\nsocially, economically, medically and in all other \r\naspects of life. This most brutal form of collective \r\npunishment by the occupying Power of the Palestinian \r\ncivilian population, which undoubtedly amounts to a \r\nwar crime, has thus far been unaffected and unshaken \r\nby international expressions of concern and calls for \r\ncessation. Instead, Israel continues to tighten the noose \r\naround Gaza and its population, choking life, hope and \r\nthe prospects of a dignified future out of that part of \r\nthe Palestinian territory, using illegal pretexts to cover \r\nup its abhorrent crimes. In reference to Israel’s closures \r\nand siege of Gaza, Mr. John Dugard, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s Special Rapporteur on the situation of human \r\nrights in the Palestinian territories occupied since \r\n1967, has stated that “it is a controlled strangulation \r\nthat seriously violates norms of human rights law and \r\nhumanitarian law”. Indeed, the International Covenant \r\non Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as \r\ncountless other relevant instruments and provisions of \r\ninternational law, are being gravely violated by the \r\noccupying Power. \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n19 07-60309 \r\n \r\n For months now, Israel has closed down all six of \r\nGaza’s crossings, significantly restricting and reducing \r\nthe amount and quality of goods allowed into Gaza and \r\nending the prospect of export from Gaza at the same \r\ntime. The effects have been devastating. Gaza’s export \r\nagriculture sector is facing the most serious threat to its \r\nexistence as we speak because of that policy. \r\nAdditionally, tens of millions of dollars in \r\ninternationally funded projects, including construction \r\nprojects — such as projects worth $160 million in \r\nnecessary construction funded by the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East, UNDP and other agencies — have been \r\nsuspended. Additionally, a shocking 90 per cent of \r\nGaza’s industries have shut down their operations, \r\nadding tens of thousands more Palestinians to the list \r\nof unemployed and needy. The siege has raised prices, \r\nsent living standards plummeting and forced \r\ninternational aid organizations and donors to divert \r\ntheir attention to providing Palestinians in Gaza with \r\ntheir most basic needs, namely, food and medicine. \r\n The World Bank has noted that the “pace of \r\ncapital flight has reached an all-time high in the last \r\ntwo years, with almost no foreign direct investment” \r\nbecause of Israel’s punishing policy of closure and \r\nsiege on the occupied Palestinian territory. \r\n UNCTAD also notes a downward economic spiral \r\nin the West Bank and Gaza, warning that this has \r\nreinforced the momentum of de-development. \r\nMeanwhile, the report of the Secretary-General on this \r\nmatter, which is contained in document A/62/82, while \r\nseriously lacking in terms of political context, does not \r\naddress this situation in the context of the occupation \r\nthat exists. Nevertheless, the report states in paragraph \r\n73 that  \r\n“The effects of these closures could not be \r\nreversed with increased humanitarian assistance. \r\nDevelopment initiatives to improve the \r\nPalestinian economy were expected to have \r\nlimited impact in an environment where intense \r\naccess restrictions prevailed.” \r\n Therefore, despite a marked increase in aid \r\nlevels, socioeconomic indicators have continued to \r\nshow significant decline. UNCTAD’s report concludes \r\nthat the Palestinian economy has lost $8.4 billion in \r\npotential income in five years, which is twice the size \r\nof the Palestinian economy today. That should alarm us \r\nall; for such potential income, combined with the \r\nlosses incurred by destroyed or sabotaged \r\ninternationally funded projects and efforts, shows the \r\ngrave trap that Palestinian development efforts and \r\ninternational assistance have actually fallen into. \r\n The alarming situation I have just described is not \r\nthe whole picture. For over a year now, Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, has not only tightened its punishing \r\nsiege but continues to illegally withhold hundreds of \r\nmillions of dollars in Palestinian tax revenues, further \r\ncurtailing the Palestinian Authority’s ability to function \r\nnormally and serve the Palestinian public. Despite the \r\ndisbursement of some of the withheld Palestinian tax \r\nrevenues, Israel continues to withhold a significant \r\namount, cynically using it as a political bargaining \r\nchip. \r\n Furthermore, the punishing sanctions imposed by \r\nthe international community on the Palestinian \r\nAuthority, combined with earlier disruptions in \r\nassistance, have made a bad economic situation almost \r\ncatastrophic. The suspension of direct international aid \r\nto the Palestinian Authority in early 2006 — which \r\nresulted in limiting assistance to basically humanitarian \r\nneeds — and the bypassing of the existing mechanisms \r\nfor coordinating aid with the Palestinian Authority \r\nhave had lasting negative consequences. As a result, \r\nalthough international aid through temporary \r\nmechanisms has increased, that cannot alleviate the \r\nlong-term ramifications of Israel’s siege and closure. \r\nMoreover, it is necessary to recall here the assessment \r\nby the World Bank that the Palestinian Authority \r\nachievements in transparency and accountability have \r\nbeen undermined by donor mechanisms to sidestep the \r\nPalestinian Authority. \r\n Perhaps the devastating results and implications \r\nof these sanctions were most aptly described by the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur, Mr. John Dugard, who said in his \r\nreport, \r\n“In effect, the Palestinian people have been \r\nsubjected to economic sanctions — the first time \r\nan occupied people have been so treated. This is \r\ndifficult to understand. Israel is in violation of \r\nmajor Security Council and General Assembly \r\nresolutions dealing with unlawful territorial \r\nchange and the violation of human rights and has \r\nfailed to implement the 2004 advisory opinion of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, yet it escapes the \r\nimposition of sanctions. Instead, the Palestinian \r\npeople, rather than the Palestinian Authority, have \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 20 \r\n \r\nbeen subjected to possibly the most rigorous form \r\nof international sanctions imposed in modern \r\ntimes”. (A/HRC/4/17, para. 54) \r\n Moreover, the Commissioner-General of the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Ms. Karen \r\nKoning AbuZayd, in a speech on 22 May 2007, also \r\nsaid that  \r\n“There is a staggering irony in the contrast \r\nbetween the universal commitment to poverty \r\neradication and the decision to impose on \r\nPalestinians one of the most severe sanctions \r\nregimes in recent history, thereby virtually \r\nguaranteeing the widespread incidence of \r\nextreme poverty”. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report highlights that the \r\nrapid interventions by the United Nations system, \r\ntemporary international mechanism and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, which together \r\ndisbursed upwards of $800 million in emergency food, \r\ncash and budget support, alleviated what could have \r\nbeen a much worse situation. However, recent reports \r\nby UNRWA, the World Food Programme (WFP) and \r\nother agencies also note that despite this increase, \r\nincomes have dropped while extreme poverty and food \r\ninsecurity have substantially increased.  \r\n In fact, approximately two thirds of the children \r\nin Gaza now suffer from anaemia, that is, iron \r\ndeficiency. Let me repeat that: approximately two \r\nthirds of children in Gaza today suffer from anaemia as \r\na result of this situation, and, 51 per cent of the \r\npopulation in Gaza is food insecure. UNRWA and WFP \r\nare providing food assistance to 1.1 million people in \r\nGaza, out of a population of 1.4 million. Mr. John Jing, \r\nUNRWA’s Director of Operations in Gaza, has \r\ndescribed one of the consequences of this bleak reality \r\nby saying that the 200,000 schoolchildren attending \r\nUNRWA-run schools come to school “hungry and \r\nunable to concentrate”. \r\n International sanctions may now have been \r\npartially lifted, but the long-term economic damage \r\narising out of the situation I have just described \r\nremains. Hence, our responsibilities are tremendous \r\nand the challenges that lie ahead are almost \r\noverwhelming. But failure is not an option, and we \r\ncontinue to rely on international action to support us in \r\naddressing this critical issue, somehow reversing the \r\ndownward economic trend and meeting the continuing \r\nneeds of the Palestinian people in the meantime. \r\n We wish to recall that in the meeting of the Ad \r\nHoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) held in London in \r\n2005, donors established new aid coordination bodies. \r\nHowever, the effectiveness of those structures was \r\nundermined by the aid boycott. Going forward, those \r\naid coordination bodies must be revitalized, especially \r\nwith the presence of the new Quartet representative, \r\nMr. Tony Blair, and his leveraging of those structures, \r\nwhich could strengthen them considerably. We \r\nwelcome the results of the AHLC meeting held in New \r\nYork on 24 September 2007 and chaired by Norway, \r\nwhich confirmed the commitment of the international \r\ncommunity to support the Palestinian Authority in \r\nbuilding strong and viable institutions. We look \r\nforward to the meeting to be held in this regard in \r\nDecember in Paris. \r\n As the Palestinian Authority continues to find \r\nitself facing a large deficit, significant debt and failing \r\nrevenues, which hinder its ability to plan for the fiscal \r\nyear ahead or to take charge of its planned economic \r\nand other reform plans as a result of the situation I just \r\ndescribed, we attach high hopes and expectations for \r\nthe upcoming donor conference in Paris. In this regard, \r\nwe look forward to seeing a tangible translation of the \r\nAHLC’s confirmation of the Palestinian Authority’s \r\nReform and Development Plan 2008-2010, which must \r\nbe regarded as a key test of true international support \r\nof and commitment to Palestinian-driven institution-\r\nbuilding, recovery and growth. We hope that the \r\nDecember conference will change the fragmented \r\nnature of aid flowing into the West Bank and Gaza so \r\nfar — aid which has largely remained based on short-\r\nterm political positions rather than a collective, long-\r\nterm view based on broader economic fundamentals, \r\nwhich is what the Palestinian economic recovery needs \r\nmost. \r\n The international community should not allow \r\nIsrael to continue to defy its obligations as an \r\noccupying Power through the illegal policies and \r\npractices that have led to the state of economic \r\nregression Palestine now faces. It is incumbent upon \r\nthe international community to ensure that the \r\noccupying Power does not continue attacking \r\ninternationally funded projects and aid workers with \r\nimpunity, as these repeated attacks have clearly \r\nderailed the development process and frustrated \r\nassistance efforts. \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n21 07-60309 \r\n \r\n Indeed, the international community must \r\nexercise its moral and legal authority by compelling \r\nthe occupying Power to cease its violations and end its \r\nchoking siege of the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, which plunges Palestine into \r\nhopelessness and deprivation. The cause of the utter \r\ndestitution Palestinians now suffer is known to all \r\nparties concerned — it is the continued Israeli military \r\noccupation. Thus, and as numerous international \r\norganizations agree, full economic recovery and \r\nrehabilitation in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nwhich are the goals driving international assistance, \r\nwill only be possible when this occupation ends. \r\n Mr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, on behalf of the United Arab \r\nEmirates and its Government, I would like to extend \r\nsincere condolences to the Government and the people \r\nof Bangladesh over the severe loss of life and property \r\ncaused by the cyclone that struck that country recently. \r\nWe hope that international assistance will be extended \r\nto Bangladesh to lessen the impact of this natural \r\ndisaster and to help the affected people there as a \r\nmatter of urgency. My country will assume its role in \r\nthat effort. \r\n The reports of the Secretary-General on the items \r\nbefore us forecast an increasing demand for \r\nhumanitarian activities from the United Nations and its \r\npartners, the relevant non-governmental organizations \r\nin the humanitarian field, in coming years. This is due \r\nto the increase in the number and severity of natural \r\ndisasters, especially in developing countries, as a result \r\nof climate change, population growth and \r\nenvironmental degradation. Their disastrous impact is \r\ncompounded by poverty, armed conflict, the spread of \r\nserious diseases and the growing number of displaced \r\npersons in many parts of the world. The result will be \r\nadditional assistance responsibilities for the United \r\nNations and its relevant entities, and a need for more \r\nhuman and financial resources. \r\n We commend the United Nations for its \r\nhumanitarian activities and its essential role in \r\nmobilizing and coordinating international efforts to \r\nprovide humanitarian and relief emergency assistance \r\nto millions in affected areas, and in easing the impact \r\nof disasters caused by natural phenomena, wars and \r\narmed conflicts, and we urge all Member States to \r\nstrengthen their cooperation with the Organization, \r\nespecially by fulfilling their financial commitments to \r\nthe agencies and to other entities responsible for \r\nhumanitarian assistance. \r\n We also urge Member States to build partnerships \r\nwith the United Nations to strengthen the necessary \r\nhumanitarian arrangements at the national, regional \r\nand international levels. In this context, we reiterate \r\nthe importance of implementing the recommendations \r\nof international conferences with respect to \r\nformulating national and international strategies to deal \r\nwith disasters in all their stages, including early \r\nwarning, relief assistance, reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Developing countries should be responsible for \r\nthe implementation of these strategies at the local \r\nlevel, and developed countries should meet their \r\ncommitments by taking all necessary measures to assist \r\ndeveloping countries in building national capacity to \r\ndeal with natural disasters and the repercussions of \r\nwar. \r\n We further stress that, in time of war or natural \r\ndisaster Governments and relevant authorities must \r\nprovide United Nations humanitarian agencies and \r\ntheir partners with access to those in need of \r\nassistance. Measures must also be taken to ensure the \r\nsafety and security of humanitarian workers. \r\n The United Arab Emirates believes in the \r\nimportance of international solidarity in time of \r\ndisaster and in the effectiveness of global partnerships \r\nin achieving the best results in emergencies assistance, \r\nand we attach great importance to fulfilling all our \r\nfinancial commitments to United Nations humanitarian \r\nassistance and development bodies. For next year, the \r\nEmirates has pledged to donate $1,538,000 to such \r\nbodies. \r\n To participate effectively in the coordination of \r\ninternational relief assistance efforts, we established \r\nthe Dubai International Humanitarian City, one of the \r\nlargest international centres providing facilities and \r\nintegrated logistical services to national, regional and \r\ninternational humanitarian organizations and agencies. \r\nIn 2006, the United Arab Emirates joined the donor \r\ncountries group, as well as the Donor Support Group, \r\nwhich comprises the world’s most active humanitarian \r\ndonor countries and which serves as an advisory body \r\nto the United Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs. \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 22 \r\n \r\n The United Arab Emirates is one of the major \r\ncontributing countries in the field of humanitarian and \r\nemergency relief assistance as well as long-term \r\nassistance in many parts of the world. The Government \r\nand a group of charitable organizations in our country, \r\nsuch as the United Arab Emirates Red Crescent \r\nAuthority, the Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahayan Charitable \r\nand Humanitarian Foundation, the Mohammed bin \r\nRashid Foundation for Charitable and Humanitarian \r\nWorks, the Al-Maktoum Foundation and others, extend \r\nhumanitarian assistance through financial and in kind \r\ndonations to affected countries, both through \r\ncooperation with United Nations agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes and through direct bilateral arrangements \r\nwith those countries.  \r\n At the same time, the United Arab Emirates \r\nworks with such countries to build national capacity to \r\ndeal with natural disasters through financing and \r\notherwise supporting programmes, research and other \r\nefforts aimed at enhancing their capacity to predict \r\ndisasters and mitigate their impact and to strengthen \r\nnational infrastructure, in order to allow them to \r\nrespond to future disasters. \r\n During the last three years alone, the contribution \r\nof the Emirates amounted to $1 billion, allocated to \r\nsupporting and enhancing the international efforts to \r\nassist victims of tsunamis, earthquakes and hurricanes \r\nin various parts of the world. Those efforts were in \r\naddition to generous donations to the reconstruction of \r\ncountries and regions affected by armed conflict, such \r\nas Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Darfur and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. \r\n The United Arab Emirates attaches great \r\nimportance to support and assistance for the Palestinian \r\npeople and their Government during the humanitarian \r\ncrisis caused by the cruel, aggressive policies imposed \r\non them by the Israeli occupying forces. Direct \r\nassistance by the United Arab Emirates to the \r\nPalestinians over the past five years has amounted to \r\nmore than $1 billion, in addition to other humanitarian \r\nassistance extended through United Nations agencies, \r\nin order to meet immediate needs, and to rebuild towns \r\ndestroyed by the continued Israeli assault.  \r\n In this regard, the Emirates has doubled its \r\ncontribution to the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA) for 2008. Up to last August, it had also \r\ncontributed $80 million to help support the budget of \r\nthe Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, the value of \r\nrelief and humanitarian projects carried out in Palestine \r\nby the United Arab Emirates Red Crescent Authority, \r\nhas exceeded $122 million, in addition to other in-kind \r\nassistance. \r\n The United Arab Emirates is deeply concerned at \r\nthe humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian people \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, which are \r\ndeteriorating as a result of continuing Israeli attacks on \r\npeople, property and infrastructure. We are also \r\nconcerned at the policy of closures and blockades \r\nimposed on the Palestinian people by the Israeli \r\noccupying forces and at the denial of access to \r\nhumanitarian assistance. This poses the threat of a \r\nserious humanitarian catastrophe. \r\n We laud the role played by the United Nations \r\nand its relevant entities in assisting the Palestinian \r\npeople, but at the same time we reaffirm the need to \r\ncompel Israel, the occupying State, to end its attacks \r\nimmediately, to lift its blockade of the Palestinians and \r\nto comply with legal international resolutions and the \r\nprovisions of international humanitarian law, as well as \r\nto resume peace negotiations on the basis of relevant \r\ninternational resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\nWe further urge donor countries to increase their \r\nassistance to the Palestinian people and Government so \r\nas to alleviate their suffering until the end of the Israeli \r\noccupation of their territory and the establishment of \r\nan independent state of Palestine, with Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif as its capital. \r\n Until then, we continue to reaffirm our support \r\nfor the ongoing mandate of UNRWA to provide \r\nservices for refugees throughout its area of operation. \r\nIn our view, it is necessary to continue financial \r\nsupport for the regular and emergency activities of the \r\nAgency so that it can fulfil its commitments to \r\nPalestinian refugees. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): At the outset, the Canadian \r\nGovernment and the Canadian people wish to extend \r\nour deepest condolences to the families of the victims \r\nof the recent cyclone in Bangladesh. \r\n Beyond simple goodwill, humanitarian action \r\nresponds to the acute needs of crisis-affected \r\npopulations and can restore dignity and hope to \r\npeople’s lives. This is not without challenge or risk. \r\nCanada attaches great importance to the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations to provide leadership and coordination \r\nwithin the humanitarian system. To that end, Canada \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n23 07-60309 \r\n \r\nwelcomes the progress achieved over the past year to \r\nstrengthen the effectiveness, efficiency and \r\ncoordination of humanitarian action. \r\n However, the international community can ill \r\nafford complacency. We need to look no further than \r\nthe Darfur region of the Sudan, Chad, Sri Lanka or \r\nAfghanistan to measure the toll that conflicts, old and \r\nnew, continue to take on civilian populations. In \r\nAfghanistan, to take but one example, we are reminded \r\nthat, without security, there can be no reconstruction or \r\ndemocratic development, and that the provision of \r\nhumanitarian assistance can be challenging. \r\n Achieving real results in the face of conflict is \r\nnot easy. Moreover, humanitarian action cannot be \r\nconsidered a substitute for political solutions. In \r\naddition, the hundreds of thousands of people affected \r\nby natural disasters over the past year remind the \r\ninternational community of the importance of making \r\nstrategic investments in disaster risk reduction in order \r\nto minimize vulnerability to natural disasters. \r\n Canada supports the ongoing efforts of Sir John \r\nHolmes, the Emergency Relief Coordinator, to \r\nstrengthen international humanitarian response. The \r\nCanadian Government also agrees with him that these \r\nefforts should no longer be termed “reform” of \r\nhumanitarian response. Better coordination, more \r\nflexible financing mechanisms and strong humanitarian \r\ncoordinators in the field should simply be viewed as \r\nthe best way to conduct international humanitarian \r\naction. \r\n The rollout of the cluster coordination system, for \r\nexample, has proven the system to be an innovative \r\napproach to promoting stronger inter-agency \r\ncooperation, including cooperation with other \r\nhumanitarian organizations. Canada welcomes the \r\nfindings of the recently released cluster evaluation. \r\nWhere it has been implemented, the cluster approach \r\nhas helped to improve the identification of gaps in \r\nresponse capacity, contributed to better information-\r\nsharing, defined centres of accountability and enabled \r\nmore effective advocacy. \r\n These are important successes, but challenges \r\nremain. We now need to buttress the capacity of cluster \r\nleads to ensure they can effectively and consistently \r\nplay a guidance role. We must address constructively \r\nthose clusters where performance has lagged behind. \r\nAccountability on the part of cluster leads is important \r\nto ensure that enhanced coordination efforts bring \r\nresults to those requiring assistance. In this context, the \r\ncluster approach rollout should continue. \r\n Effective coordination relies on having the right \r\npeople with the right mix of skills and experience \r\navailable to provide clear leadership. Here, the role of \r\nhumanitarian coordinators remains vital. Their \r\nprofessional experience, training and skill sets should \r\nenable them to provide invaluable leadership for the \r\noverall humanitarian presence. Canada urges the Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) \r\nto continue to focus on strengthening the role and \r\ncapacity of humanitarian coordinators. This will \r\nrequire greater attention in order to ensure real and \r\nlasting progress, but it remains central to ensuring \r\neffective international humanitarian action. \r\n Canada also supports ongoing efforts to enhance \r\nthe flexibility of humanitarian funding mechanisms. \r\nThe Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is an \r\nimportant example of this commitment. We are very \r\npleased that CERF continues to demonstrate its value \r\nas a bridge for providing timely financing for rapid-\r\nonset and under-funded emergencies. Over one-third of \r\nMember States — developing and developed countries \r\nalike — have already contributed to CERF. Canada \r\nurges Member States that have not yet done so to \r\nconsider contributing to this important Fund, while \r\nmaintaining the level of their commitments to other \r\nhumanitarian financing tools. \r\n Humanitarian funding mechanisms such as CERF \r\nmust be guided by coherent and reliable evidence-\r\nbased needs assessments and analysis. This is at the \r\nheart of good humanitarian donorship. Here, OCHA \r\nhas a critical role to play in order to ensure that the \r\nquality of needs assessments is consistent, while \r\ntimely, since donors rely on them to respond \r\nappropriately. United Nations humanitarian actors must \r\nwork closely together to ensure that efforts are \r\ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n There are some cases, however, where troops \r\npossess a unique capacity for action that can be put to \r\nuse in responding to serious natural disasters. In this \r\nregard, OCHA has a key role to play in ensuring that \r\nassets are deployed based on assessed needs, rather \r\nthan being supply-driven, and that such assets are \r\nutilized in a manner that respects the principles of \r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality. Our goal must be \r\nto provide the right assets at the right time, in order to \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 24 \r\n \r\naddress genuine needs and gaps in humanitarian \r\nresponse. \r\n More than ever, the commitment of Member \r\nStates to strengthening humanitarian responses in crisis \r\ncontexts must include a renewed commitment to \r\nensuring the safety and security of humanitarian \r\nworkers. Attacks against United Nations and other \r\nhumanitarian workers increased dramatically during \r\nthe past 10 years, and they often occur with complete \r\nimpunity. Once again, Canada urges all Member States \r\nwhich have not done so to sign or ratify the 1994 \r\nConvention on Safety of United Nations and \r\nAssociated Personnel.  \r\n Finally, I would like to express our gratitude to \r\nSir John Holmes for the diligence with which he is \r\ndischarging his responsibilities as Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator.  \r\n In conclusion, we as Member States must \r\ntogether continue to elaborate and improve on the tools \r\nand strategies needed to help guide international \r\nhumanitarian action. We must also be in a position to \r\nmonitor and evaluate humanitarian access and request \r\nthat States report on their actions when such access has \r\nbeen hindered or denied. To this end, we must all \r\ncontinue to be vigilant. The success of our efforts will \r\nultimately be judged on our ability to protect and help \r\nthe most vulnerable populations. \r\n Mrs. Juul (Norway): Let me first of all express \r\nmy Government’s deep sympathy for and solidarity \r\nwith the Government and people of Bangladesh at this \r\nvery difficult hour.  \r\n Norway is a strong supporter of the humanitarian \r\nwork of the United Nations. We support the \r\nOrganization’s reform agenda and the efforts made to \r\nstrengthen the humanitarian support system. A lot has \r\nbeen done but, there are still challenges that need to be \r\naddressed. I intend to highlight some important issues \r\nin this regard.  \r\n Norway is deeply concerned about the sexual and \r\ngender based violence that each year destroys the lives \r\nof thousands of women and girls, as well as men and \r\nboys. The continued use of sexual violence as a method \r\nof warfare is appalling. Few perpetrators of these \r\nabhorrent acts are brought to justice. There must be an \r\nend to the impunity for these severe crimes. As \r\nguardians of international humanitarian and human \r\nrights law it is our collective responsibility to ensure \r\nthat such acts do not go unpunished.  \r\n The response from the international community \r\nmust be intensified, including by the United Nations, \r\nwhich should take the lead in establishing more \r\neffective preventive and protective measures to address \r\nsexual and gender-based violence.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s recommendations for \r\naction against sexual violence, contained in his report \r\nto the Security Council on the protection of civilians in \r\narmed conflict (S/2007/643) are important steps in this \r\nregard and in the formation of the United Nations \r\nAction against Sexual Violence in Conflict. The \r\ninternational community has shown its revulsion of \r\nsexual violence, including by the adoption of various \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. There is an urgent need for \r\nthe full implementation of these resolutions.  \r\n Access is another major challenge. Access for \r\nhumanitarian actors to populations in need and the \r\nrelated ability of such populations to receive \r\nhumanitarian assistance is the prerequisite for all \r\nhumanitarian operations, as set forth under \r\ninternational humanitarian law. The host Government \r\nhas the responsibility to ensure rapid, safe and \r\nunhindered access and to fully cooperate with the \r\nUnited Nations and other humanitarian actors. The \r\narbitrary denial of such access is an unacceptable \r\npractice that places the lives of millions in danger and \r\nunnecessarily prolongs their suffering. \r\n Protection is key in this regard. Norway supports \r\nthe recommendation of the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport to the Security Council on the protection of \r\ncivilians in armed conflict, and we are looking forward \r\nto the debate in the Council tomorrow.  \r\n We need to be better prepared to respond to \r\nhumanitarian emergencies than we currently are. \r\nPrevention needs to be placed higher on the agenda of \r\nthe United Nations. It is widely acknowledged that \r\nclimate change causes environmental degradation, \r\nfloods, droughts, hurricanes, involuntary migration, \r\nincreased urbanization and an explosion in slum-\r\ndwelling. We are also faced with prolonged armed \r\nconflicts that increasingly affect already vulnerable \r\nStates and populations.  \r\n Prevention efforts will save more lives and cost \r\nless, but, the world community seems more willing to \r\npay for the damages than to invest in the cost for \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n25 07-60309 \r\n \r\npreventive measures. What should be done to mitigate \r\nthe effects of humanitarian disasters in this changing \r\nworld?  \r\n First, there is a need for a global spokesperson. In \r\nthis regard Norway welcomes the commitment \r\ndemonstrated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator in \r\nincreasing awareness of the importance of better \r\npreventive measures. These efforts should be \r\nintensified.  \r\n Secondly, we need to strengthen our resolve in \r\nreforming the international humanitarian response \r\nsystem, including more responsive and appropriate \r\nfunding mechanism, such as the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund, and the establishment of humanitarian \r\nresponse funds in disaster-prone countries. Adequately \r\nfunding is key, however, and we urge more Member \r\nStates and other donors to contribute to these funds. \r\nThere is furthermore a need for better coordination \r\nboth among the various United Nations agencies and \r\nbetween the United Nations agencies and other \r\nhumanitarian actors. There is a need to strengthen the \r\nfunctions of the resident and humanitarian \r\ncoordinators. To this end, Norway is a strong supporter \r\nof the cluster approach, which increasingly will \r\ncontribute to better coordination and prioritization in \r\nrelation to existing humanitarian needs, and \r\nfurthermore will serve as an early-warning system for \r\nemerging disasters.  \r\n Finally, there is still a need for enhanced efforts \r\nin capacity development for humanitarian personnel, as \r\nwell as a need to establish better roster systems with \r\npools of experts from all humanitarian fields that are \r\nimmediately operational and ready for deployment. \r\nOnly in this way will we be ready and prepared to deal \r\nwith the humanitarian consequences when disaster \r\nstrikes. \r\n Mr. Hussein (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to convey my appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports. They help facilitate \r\nour discussion on strengthening the coordination of \r\nemergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations, a subject to which Egypt attaches great \r\nimportance and attention. The reality reflected in these \r\nreports raises the concern of the international \r\ncommunity about present and future challenges, \r\nmeaning that it should work effectively to tackle those \r\nconcerns, as last year witnessed continued increases in \r\nthe number of disasters and their victims.  \r\n We are concerned about the statistics which \r\nindicate that the number of climate-related or hydro-\r\nmeteorological hazard events, such as floods, \r\nhurricanes and droughts, had increased dramatically, \r\nparticularly in Africa, over the last 20 years. That \r\nprevailing pattern of increase in frequency and \r\nintensity of disasters and in their strength, destructive \r\nimpact and consequences is a major source of concern. \r\nThe economic impact of disasters associated with \r\nnatural hazards has been recognized as a key factor \r\nchallenging the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Despite the progress made in some long-standing \r\nemergencies, according to the improvement of political \r\ncircumstances in these conflicts and the reduction of \r\nviolence, the same period continues to witness an \r\nincreased degeneration of those conflicts, the use of \r\nmany forms of violence and the steady rate of increase \r\nof natural hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes, \r\ncyclones, storms and floods. Such hazards affirm the \r\nneed to focus on strengthening the capacity of the \r\nrelevant United Nations entities to provide \r\nhumanitarian assistance to confront the results of \r\nemergency cases on the lives and livelihood of millions \r\nof people. \r\n Other conflicts continue to rage throughout the \r\nworld, contributing to the deterioration of the \r\nhumanitarian situation caused when approximately \r\n4 million people were forced to flee their homes in \r\n2006. This requires the provision of additional \r\nhumanitarian assistance to meet their needs. I should \r\nlike to emphasis the situation in sisterly Iraq, where, as \r\nindicated in the Secretary-General’s report, the civilian \r\ndeath toll now averages more than 100 per day. An \r\nestimated 8 million civilians, including internally \r\ndisplaced persons and refugees to neighbouring \r\ncountries, are in urgent need of humanitarian \r\nassistance. Moreover, the deteriorating situation in \r\nSomalia requires greater efforts by the international \r\ncommunity to provide necessary humanitarian \r\nassistance, given the difficult conditions in the country \r\nand the international disregard of its need for peace \r\nand stability. \r\n Therefore, Egypt emphasizes the urgent need for \r\ninstitutional capacity-building in developing countries \r\nso they can effectively and successfully manage natural \r\ndisasters. That means first strengthening the capacities \r\nof countries in the areas of predictability, preparedness \r\nand early warning and helping them to eliminate the \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 26 \r\n \r\neffects of the disaster, to rebuild and to return \r\neffectively to the path of sustainable development. \r\n Despite the many international documents \r\nemphasizing the importance of building disaster \r\nresponse capacities, these remain limited because of a \r\nlack of resources and funding, due mainly to the \r\nincreasing number of natural disasters and their strong \r\neffects as a result of climate change and our feeble \r\ncapacity to deal with it. Greater United Nations efforts \r\nare required to coordinate the efforts of international \r\nbodies and to promote international multilateral \r\ncooperation to respond to these changes. \r\n Therefore, we affirm the importance of the role of \r\ndonors and the relevant humanitarian organizations, \r\nworking together with Member States, in investing in \r\nstrategies aimed at preparedness and swift recovery \r\nand in reducing the dangers posed by emergency \r\nhumanitarian situations. We also agree that the regional \r\ndimension is important in responding to crises that \r\nrequire cross-border responses. \r\n In that regard, humanitarian actors must fulfil \r\ntheir specific obligations under national and \r\ninternational humanitarian law when they interact with \r\nthe citizens — particularly women and children — of \r\nthe affected countries in which they operate. In \r\naddition, they must not become involved in activities \r\nsuch as sexual exploitation and child trafficking, which \r\nviolate the principles of the United Nations Charter, \r\nnational laws and international humanitarian law. They \r\nmust be committed to the rules set out in resolution \r\n46/182, which provides for the role of relevant \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society in \r\nactivities carried out in countries affected by \r\nhumanitarian disasters.  \r\n Eager to participate in international efforts to \r\ncope with the effects of humanitarian disasters and to \r\ndeliver emergency humanitarian relief, Egypt was \r\namong the founders of the Central Emergency Relief \r\nFund (CERF), providing it with financial and technical \r\nsupport through an Egyptian expert’s participation in \r\nthe Fund’s Advisory Group. In that regard, we support \r\nefforts to maximize the Fund’s effectiveness and help it \r\nachieve the goals set out by the General Assembly, in \r\nareas where insufficient funding has been made \r\navailable. We also welcome the role of the World \r\nBank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and \r\nRecovery, which was launched in September 2006 to \r\nenhance the disaster-preparedness of States that are \r\nmost vulnerable to disasters. To date, $30 million has \r\nbeen contributed to the Facility. \r\n I should like to express our condolences to the \r\npeople and the Government of Bangladesh on the \r\nlosses resulting from the most recent cyclone to strike \r\ntheir country, which caused loss of life and damage to \r\nproperty. In that connection, we call on the United \r\nNations to urgently provide, through CERF or any \r\nother relevant initiative, all the assistance necessary to \r\nhelp that sisterly country recover from the effects of \r\nthis painful disaster. \r\n Recent events highlight the importance of \r\naccording particular attention to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on assistance to the Palestinian people \r\n(A/62/82). The tragic realities faced by the Palestinian \r\npeople — including the destruction of infrastructure, \r\nthe cutting off of electricity and water, the chopping \r\ndown and uprooting of trees and the destruction of \r\nfarmland — have worsened their humanitarian situation \r\nand caused a human tragedy. That requires greater \r\nefforts by the international community, particularly the \r\nUnited Nations, to intervene to stop those policies and \r\npractices and to provide the assistance necessary to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people.  \r\n The continued closure operations, the financial \r\ncrisis and the withholding of Palestinian tax revenues \r\nby Israel have had an immediate impact in terms of \r\ndeclining income, increasing poverty, lack of food \r\nsecurity and reduced capacity to respond to natural \r\ndisasters in the occupied Palestinian territories. \r\nTherefore, we call on the international community to \r\nprovide greater financial support in order to prevent \r\nfurther deterioration of the quality of life within the \r\noccupied Palestine territories and a further decline of \r\nthe Palestinian economy, and to meet the increasing \r\neconomic, social, and humanitarian needs of the \r\nPalestinian people. Continued international efforts to \r\nthat end should be accompanied by efforts to establish \r\na viable independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem \r\nas its capital. \r\n The role of the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East must \r\nalso be supported so it can play its role in the \r\nPalestinian territories. Israel must respect the \r\nAgreement on Movement and Access, enabling the \r\nPalestinian people to interact freely with the outside \r\nworld, to gain access to humanitarian assistance and to \r\nlift restrictions on delivery of such assistance. \r\n A/62/PV.53\r\n \r\n27 07-60309 \r\n \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reports submitted under these agenda \r\nitems. I should like to make a few comments on the \r\ntheme. \r\n Over the past year, frequent natural disasters have \r\ncaused enormous human and economic losses to the \r\nGovernments and peoples of the countries affected. In \r\n2006, the world endured 427 such disasters, which \r\ncaused the loss of 23,000 lives, disrupted the daily \r\nlives of 143 million people and resulted in economic \r\ndamage amounting to nearly $20 billion. Since the \r\nbeginning of this year, the United Nations system has \r\nlaunched as many as 15 humanitarian flash appeals, \r\nbreaking the record for the same period in previous \r\nyears. United Nations humanitarian relief work now \r\nfaces increasingly daunting challenges. \r\n Since emergency disaster relief efforts began in \r\n2004 in response to the Indian Ocean tsunami, the \r\nleading and coordinating role of the United Nations in \r\ninternational humanitarian assistance activities has \r\ngained increasing attention. With broad and in-depth \r\nparticipation in international humanitarian assistance \r\nefforts by more and more countries, international \r\norganizations, the private sector and non-governmental \r\norganizations, finding ways to further enhance \r\ncoordination and make full and effective use of \r\nresources to maximize the benefits has become a new \r\nand arduous task confronting the United Nations. \r\n The Chinese delegation believes that there are \r\ntwo main aspects to enhancing coordination. The first \r\nis coordination within the United Nations system. \r\nMany United Nations departments and agencies \r\ninvolved in humanitarian assistance activities have \r\ndifferent competences, spheres of operation, areas of \r\nfocus and comparative advantages. They complement \r\none another, but they also have a certain degree of \r\noverlap. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen inter-\r\nagency coordination, to improve the overall planning \r\nof humanitarian activities, to clarify the division of \r\nlabour and to enhance the efficiency of operations and \r\nthe cost-effectiveness of the use of resources.  \r\n The second aspect is the coordination of relief \r\nactivities provided by the entire international \r\ncommunity. The United Nations plays an irreplaceable \r\nrole in that respect. We welcome the building of \r\npartnerships between the United Nations and relevant \r\ncountries, international institutions and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, with a view to \r\nachieving better information-sharing and broadening \r\nareas of cooperation. \r\n In relief activities, the Government of the \r\naffected country bears primary responsibility for \r\norganizing, initiating, coordinating and implementing \r\nexternal relief assistance. It should also play a leading \r\nrole as emergency humanitarian assistance is received, \r\nas well as during the transition from relief to \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n When providing humanitarian assistance to \r\naffected countries, the United Nations should always \r\nadhere to the principles of humanity, neutrality and \r\nimpartiality. It should respect the sovereignty of those \r\ncountries, enhance communication and collaboration \r\nwith their Governments, fully utilize their existing \r\nrelief mechanisms and be guided by the needs of the \r\naffected Governments and peoples in organizing and \r\ncoordinating international humanitarian assistance. \r\n In recent years, the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has worked tirelessly to \r\nassess disaster situations, appeal for donations and \r\norganize and coordinate emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance worldwide. The Chinese delegation \r\nexpresses its appreciation to the Office and supports \r\nthe further strengthening of its leading role in \r\ncoordinating international humanitarian assistance \r\nactivities. It is our hope that OCHA will continue to \r\ncooperate actively with the Governments of affected \r\ncountries and provide the necessary guidance and \r\nassistance to humanitarian actors at all levels. \r\n Since its launch in March 2006, the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund (CERF) has provided \r\ntimely and effective relief assistance in a number of \r\nmajor natural disasters and emergencies, thus playing a \r\npositive role in improving resource allocation and \r\nutilization and in helping some previously neglected \r\ncountries and regions hit by disasters to gain access to \r\nhumanitarian assistance. The Chinese delegation calls \r\nupon all Governments, those of developed countries in \r\nparticular, to contribute generously to the Fund in order \r\nto reach the target of mobilizing $500 million for 2008. \r\n Greater international and regional cooperation is \r\none of the effective means to help disaster-prone \r\ncountries to upgrade their capacity for disaster \r\npreparedness, reduction and response. The United \r\nNations should attach importance to facilitating such \r\ncooperation; it should offer technical and financial \r\nA/62/PV.53  \r\n \r\n07-60309 28 \r\n \r\nassistance to highly disaster-prone countries to help \r\nthem gradually to establish early warning systems and \r\nto enhance their capacity to prepare for, mitigate and \r\nrespond to emergencies, so as to ensure that \r\nhumanitarian relief helps to address both the symptoms \r\nand the root causes of natural disasters. \r\n China, a developing country, is no stranger to \r\nnatural disasters. We know first-hand what suffering \r\nand economic losses natural disasters bring to the \r\naffected peoples and countries. My country is hit by \r\nvarious kinds of natural disasters every year, so it is the \r\nperennial task of government at all levels to prepare for \r\nand mitigate disasters and to provide emergency \r\ndisaster relief, which has entailed huge economic \r\nburdens for the Government.  \r\n The Chinese Government attaches great \r\nimportance to international cooperation in the field of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. It has actively participated in \r\ninternational humanitarian relief activities in response \r\nto requests by affected countries and to appeals by the \r\ninternational community. This year, the Chinese \r\nGovernment has provided timely bilateral humanitarian \r\nassistance, within its capacity, both in cash and in kind, \r\nto many affected countries, among them Pakistan, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Madagascar, \r\nthe Sudan and Greece, to name just a few.  \r\n Those examples fully demonstrate the sympathy, \r\nsupport and concern of the Government and the people \r\nof China for affected Governments and peoples. My \r\nGovernment will continue, as always, to support the \r\nefforts of the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity in disaster prevention, mitigation and relief \r\nand stands ready to help affected countries to overcome \r\ndisasters and rebuild their homes. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
