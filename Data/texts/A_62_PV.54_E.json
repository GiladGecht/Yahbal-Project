That line \r\nshould read “within existing resources, the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations system and with other”, adding the \r\nword “with”. The paragraph will then continue as \r\nreflected in the document. \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing the solidarity of the Philippines with the \r\nGovernment and people of Bangladesh at this time of \r\nsorrow and suffering that the recent cyclone has caused \r\nto their nation. The Philippines expresses its heartfelt \r\nsympathy to the victims and assures Bangladesh and its \r\npeople of the prayers and hopes of the Philippines for \r\ntheir early recovery from this catastrophe. \r\n The Philippines commends and congratulates the \r\nSecretary-General on his report under agenda item 71, \r\nentitled “Strengthening of the coordination of \r\nemergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations, including special economic assistance” \r\ncontinued in document A/62/87. We fully concur with \r\nhis conclusions and recommendations in the light of \r\nthe severity of natural disasters that may be associated \r\nwith climate change, and the need for special focus on \r\ndeveloping countries. This is especially true with \r\nrespect to their vulnerable peoples, due to the \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 2 \r\n \r\ndifficulties and constraints developing countries have \r\nin facing the immediate effects of these disasters, not \r\nonly in mitigating the inevitable consequences of \r\nnatural disasters, but also in finding measures and \r\nadopting strategies that would make their adaptation to \r\nthe consequences of natural disasters a less painful \r\nexperience. At the same time, they must work to ensure \r\npreparedness for future occurrences. \r\n The Philippines takes particular note of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on humanitarian assistance \r\nand rehabilitation for the Philippines, which is included \r\nin his report in document A/62/310. My delegation is \r\ngrateful for the comprehensive narrative of the \r\nassistance rendered by the United Nations to the \r\nPhilippines in connection with the oil spill on \r\n11 August 2006 from a tanker off the south-western \r\ncoast of the Province of Guimaras, in the central \r\nPhilippines, close to my own province of Cebu. \r\n I was still in the Philippines when this tragic \r\nincident occurred. It was an unprecedented maritime \r\ndisaster that caused severe damage which will take \r\nyears to repair and for the affected areas to recover. \r\nThe Philippines further takes note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations and conclusions, which no \r\ndoubt will send a strong message to the international \r\ncommunity for its continued humanitarian support. \r\n My country expresses its gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report on the Philippines and \r\nputs on record its debt of gratitude to all those who \r\nresponded immediately and provided assistance to my \r\ncountry, both bilaterally and through the United \r\nNations system, particularly through the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and \r\nUNICEF, in the post-disaster rehabilitation phase. The \r\nrapid needs assessment mission, led by UNDP and \r\ninvolving the United Nations Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Office of \r\nCivil Defense of the Philippine Government, drafted an \r\nearly recovery assessment report that proved to be an \r\nessential guide to the measures to be taken. All the help \r\nextended to the Philippines, especially to those directly \r\naffected by the oil spill, lessened the tragic impact of \r\nthis disaster. It has been said that gratitude is the \r\nlanguage of the heart. In that regard, the Philippines’ \r\nheart is full. \r\n However, in paragraph 60 of his report, the \r\nSecretary-General concludes that  \r\n “There is still significant need for additional \r\nsupport in achieving the longer-term objectives that \r\ninclude: full restoration of the damaged \r\nenvironment; further development and \r\nstrengthening of alternative livelihood programmes; \r\nimproved disaster risk management; preparedness \r\nand mitigation to build disaster-resilient \r\ncommunities; and promoting development in the \r\ntourism sector”. \r\n Over a year after this unfortunate calamity, the \r\nProvince of Guimaras, its people and economy are still \r\nfar from regaining normal life and the promise of a \r\nbright future. The oil retrieval operations from the \r\nsunken hull of the MT Solar 1 ended in April of this \r\nyear, with less than 5,000 litres of bunker oil \r\nrecovered, out of a total of over 2.1 million litres. This \r\nmeans that almost the entire load of oil was dispersed \r\nin the pristine waters off Guimaras. It seems difficult to \r\ndescribe this large amount — 2.1 million litres — as \r\nmerely an “oil spill”; unlike a spill that can be easily \r\ncleaned up, the pernicious effects of this event will \r\ncontinue to be felt for many, many years. \r\n We need not dwell on the obvious environmental \r\nor human respiratory-related health impact of the \r\npolluting oil. It should be noted, however, that the first \r\nrapid assessment of the oil spill, conducted by the \r\nUniversity of the Philippines in Visayas, also found \r\nsignificant psycho-social effects on normal living \r\nconditions engendered by the loss of habitat and the \r\nstrenuous clean-up efforts. The long-term effects on \r\nhuman health and the environment have yet to be \r\nevaluated or accounted for. In terms of the economy, \r\nthe most direct effect of the oil spill remains the loss of \r\nlivelihood for the affected population. \r\n A recent study presented last month at the Ninth \r\nNational Symposium on Marine Science revealed a \r\n65 per cent decline in fish abundance in the waters off \r\nGuimaras since the event of August 2006. The \r\nPhilippine Department of Environment and Natural \r\nResources and mangrove experts also reported the \r\ndeath of at least 600 mature trees in mangroves that \r\nserve as breeding and feeding grounds for fish. These \r\nfindings seemingly validate the observations and \r\ncomplaints of the fisherfolk and residents in the \r\naffected areas that their fish catch has substantially \r\ndecreased. \r\n The local tourism industry also has not recovered \r\nfrom the disaster, as tourist arrivals have decreased in \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n3 07-60509 \r\n \r\nnumber compared to previous years. Even though only \r\nan estimated 20 per cent of beach tourism was actually \r\naffected by the oil spill, other destinations on the island \r\nsuffered due to the impression that the entire island \r\nwas contaminated by oil sludge. Unfortunately, even \r\nthe indemnification provided by the International Oil \r\nPollution Compensation Fund has been described as \r\nbeing insufficient in terms both of the amount and \r\ncoverage. \r\n Despite this sad, painful reality that I have just \r\ndescribed, there is also much to be said for the \r\noptimism and resolve of the local authorities and the \r\npeople of Guimaras to rise above adversity. The \r\ninternational community and the national Government \r\nhave put in place plans and programmes to help speed \r\nup recovery, and the company whose oil caused these \r\nproblems, PETRON, remains fully engaged in the \r\nhealing process. It is hoped that, after hearing its name \r\nmentioned here, PETRON will do more. \r\n My delegation hopes that the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations system will \r\ncontinue to render assistance and provide guidance, as \r\nneeded, for the full recovery of the environment and \r\nthe people of Guimaras. What they will do will also \r\nprovide hope to other States and peoples who suffer \r\nfrom natural or man-made disasters. \r\n Mr. Čekuolis (Lithuania): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nPortugal on behalf of the European Union. In addition, \r\nallow me to make the following comments.  \r\n Lithuania thanks the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport submitted for consideration under agenda item \r\n71 (d). We support the findings of the report and \r\nwelcome the efforts of all relevant parties involved in \r\nstudying, mitigating and minimizing the consequences \r\nof the Chernobyl disaster. \r\n Lithuania has a number of people affected by the \r\nChernobyl disaster, of whom about 6,000 are registered \r\nas belonging to the high-risk group and suffering from \r\nits consequences, as they took direct part in the clean-\r\nup and liquidation of the effects of the nuclear disaster.  \r\n Together with relevant non-profit organizations \r\noperating on behalf of the victims, the Government of \r\nLithuania is pursuing a number of programmes and \r\nactivities in the areas of social security and health care \r\nfor people affected by Chernobyl. Legislation has been \r\nadopted to define the juridical status of persons \r\naffected while eliminating the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl nuclear disaster. Relevant Government \r\ndecisions provide for compensation to persons affected \r\ndue to their participation in the clean-up of the nuclear \r\naccident or to their relatives in case of the demise of \r\ndirect victims. If health conditions deteriorate, the \r\npersons affected are entitled to repeated compensation. \r\nThey are also entitled to certain types of free medical \r\ntreatment. \r\n A national Chernobyl health centre has been \r\nestablished under the Ministry of Health. The centre \r\nkeeps a database on individuals who participated in the \r\nChernobyl clean-up, organizes regular health care \r\ncheck-ups, offers treatment and advice, analyses and \r\npublishes relevant data, organizes conferences on the \r\nhealth care of affected persons, and maintains ties with \r\norganizations that deal with radiation exposure issues. \r\nA special centre was established for children born to \r\nthe families of affected individuals. \r\n Some time ago, the Ministry of Health of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania adopted the 2006-2010 \r\nprogramme of health care for persons who took part in \r\neliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear \r\ndisaster, aimed at providing relevant health care and \r\nseeking to minimize the rates of sickness, morbidity \r\nand disabilities. The programme also aims at \r\ncontributing to international research on the impact of \r\nlight radiation exposures. The programme is \r\ncoordinated by the Chernobyl health centre of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania. \r\n Mr. Pramudwinai (Thailand): I thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening this \r\njoint meeting, which provides us with a timely and \r\nuseful opportunity to call for the strengthening of the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance.  \r\n At the outset, allow me also to join other \r\ncolleagues in expressing our sympathy to the people of \r\nBangladesh on its tragic national calamity. May I just \r\nadd that Thailand has conveyed its deep condolences to \r\nthe Government and people of Bangladesh and is \r\nworking on its relief contribution to the people of that \r\ncountry.  \r\n The recent catastrophe once again serves as a \r\nwarning sign on the devastating impacts of \r\nuncontrollable natural disasters derived from both \r\nnatural phenomena and man-made activities. The more \r\nsevere and frequent natural hazards are alerting us to \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 4 \r\n \r\ncall for stronger cooperation in humanitarian \r\nassistance. \r\n Thailand welcomes the comprehensive report of \r\nthe Secretary-General concerning international \r\ncooperation on humanitarian assistance in natural \r\ndisasters, from relief to development. The highlighted \r\nsignificant trends and their humanitarian implications \r\nlead us to set priorities in the field of humanitarian \r\nassistance and rapid response to disasters. The updated \r\nfigures demonstrate that a number of hydro-\r\nmeteorological and geological hazards, as well as \r\nepidemics, have increased dramatically. Those natural \r\ndisasters have unleashed multiple hazards on society, \r\nparticularly on the poorest, who are the most \r\nvulnerable. While provisions for recovery have been \r\nand are being provided through various international \r\nand national relief efforts, we expect to observe longer-\r\nterm, well-coordinated and more concrete and \r\nconcerted efforts to mitigate the impact of natural \r\ndisasters through disaster prevention and preparedness \r\nmeasures. \r\n Thailand wishes to see an integrated approach on \r\nthe part of national or regional entities in partnering \r\nwith such United Nations agencies as the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the \r\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)-\r\nUNESCO, the International Strategy for Disaster \r\nReduction and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme in order to ensure optimal synergies with \r\nother related efforts, avoid duplication of work and \r\nlead to a more effective and better coordinated \r\nresponse of humanitarian assistance to people affected \r\nby natural disasters and emergency situations.  \r\n We believe that humanitarian assistance should \r\nbe firmly based on the actual needs on the ground and \r\nappropriate management, and equipped with \r\nsophisticated technology and sufficient resources. \r\nStrengthening preparedness, coordination and rapid \r\nresponse mechanisms in the wake of a disaster may \r\nprovide an opportunity to mobilize support for \r\ninvestment in disaster preparedness and mitigation. \r\nHowever, mobilizing the resources involved is always \r\none of the greatest concerns.  \r\n Thailand welcomes the establishment of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to fill that \r\ngap and takes note with appreciation of the timely \r\nresponse it puts on the ground. Thailand has also \r\ncontributed annually to CERF. The efficiency of fund \r\nallocation in the recent case of the Peruvian earthquake \r\nlast August has proven that CERF is a useful \r\nmechanism for generating early and prompt response to \r\ndisasters and helps solve the problem of financial \r\nassistance delays and shortages. We are looking to see \r\nthat effective response again in the recent case of \r\nBangladesh. \r\n At the regional level, Thailand’s $10-million \r\ncontribution to establishing the United Nations \r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific Tsunami Regional Trust Fund, which is aimed \r\nat speeding up ongoing efforts to enhance national \r\ncapacity and create a reliable tsunami warning system \r\nin the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia regions, has \r\nalready assisted certain regional projects in disaster \r\npreparedness and in setting up an early warning \r\nsystem. \r\n The Trust Fund was allocated to the Asian \r\nDisaster Reduction Centre for a training programme on \r\ncommunity-based hazard map development for India \r\nand Bangladesh, as well as to the UNESCO/IOC \r\nproject for strengthening tsunami warning and \r\nemergency responses by providing training workshops \r\non the development of standard operating procedures \r\nin 16 countries located along the coastline of the Indian \r\nOcean, from Iran to Timor-Leste. Also, a large portion \r\nof the fund was granted to the Asian Disaster \r\nPreparedness Centre, which was entrusted at the \r\nPhuket ministerial meeting of 2005 as a regional focal \r\npoint for the tsunami early warning system in the \r\nIndian Ocean. It has installed tide-gauge stations in the \r\ncoastal areas of Myanmar, the Philippines and Viet \r\nNam to form an initial network in detecting tsunamis. \r\n At this time, more than half of the initial budget \r\nprovided by the Thai and Swedish Governments in \r\n2005 — in the amount of $12.5 million — has been \r\nallocated to the projects to which I have referred. \r\nMeanwhile, many associated projects are still waiting \r\nin the pipeline. The establishment of a comprehensive \r\nmulti-nodal network thus still requires substantive \r\nsupport from all parties concerned to fully achieve its \r\nobjectives and further contribute to disaster reduction \r\nand mitigation in all regions of the world. Thailand \r\nwould therefore like to call upon developed countries \r\nto make efforts to provide more contributions and \r\ntechnical cooperation related to the development of a \r\nnatural disaster warning system. \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n5 07-60509 \r\n \r\n In that regard, Thailand would like to commend \r\nthe recent pledge of $400,000 by the Government of \r\nthe Republic of Korea and the $2,000 contribution \r\nfrom Nepalese Government. In terms of technical \r\nassistance, Thailand would like to thank the United \r\nStates for sponsoring the deployment in the Indian \r\nOcean, in December 2006, of the first deep-ocean \r\nassessment and reporting of tsunami device, the \r\nso-called DART buoy. This sophisticated device will \r\nassist in detecting tsunami susceptibly generated by \r\nconvergent plate movement in the deep sea, which will \r\nhelp to save millions of people living along the Indian \r\nOcean coastline. \r\n At the national level, Thailand was among the \r\n168 countries that adopted the Hyogo Framework for \r\nAction 2005-2015. The strategic national action plan \r\nfor disaster risk reduction is being prepared to provide \r\ndirection for the country in undertaking disaster risk \r\nreduction over the next decade, in accordance with the \r\ncontext of the Hyogo Framework. The plan is expected \r\nto lead the country to meet the international safety \r\nstandards by the year 2017. \r\n I would like to further inform the Assembly that \r\nThailand has paid great attention to the people who \r\nsuffer the most when disaster strikes. We agree with \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report (A/62/323) concerning \r\nthe evolving nature of risk patterns, which has \r\nimplications for exposed groups in low-income \r\nsettings.  \r\n We have made progress in integrating disaster \r\nreduction into local communities and school \r\ncurriculums. Last year, the ministries concerned, in \r\ncooperation with the Asian Disaster Reduction Center, \r\nlaunched a project to educate school children in the \r\ntsunami-prone area on how to observe and respond to \r\nsuch a disaster. It is crucial to prepare our next \r\ngeneration and to make them aware of and resilient to \r\nthe increasing multiple hazards that the Earth currently \r\nfaces. Besides that programme, Thailand also promotes \r\nthe involvement of local communities and civil society \r\nin disaster risk reduction activities through various \r\ninitiatives — such as the Mr. Disaster Warning \r\nprogramme, community-based disaster risk \r\nmanagement and the civil defence volunteers \r\nprogramme. Thailand would be pleased to cooperate \r\nand share with other countries its experiences in this \r\narea. \r\n Finally, I would like to express our thanks for the \r\nwork of United Nations organizations involved in \r\nhumanitarian assistance, as well as donor countries and \r\norganizations for their financial and technical support. \r\nHumanitarian assistance still requires a great deal of \r\nresources, technology and manpower. We believe that \r\nall platforms emerging from United Nations initiatives \r\nand coordination will lead us to more frequent and \r\nfruitful exchanges of good practices and further \r\npromote our cooperation in disaster management and \r\nhumanitarian assistance. \r\n Mr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to begin by expressing our \r\nresolute solidarity with the victims of the most recent \r\nnatural disasters, notably those that occurred in \r\nBangladesh and Chile last week. The challenges \r\nresulting from various events of this year prompt us to \r\nspeak out today to share some ideas related to our own \r\nexperience in Guatemala that we believe are important. \r\nBefore offering some specific observations, however, I \r\ntoo would like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nthorough and detailed reports, as well as for the \r\nrecommendations they contain, which serve as the \r\nbasis for our deliberations.  \r\n Thirty-one years ago, my country was taken by \r\nsurprise and pummelled by one of the most devastating \r\nearthquakes in our history, which measured 7.5 on the \r\nRichter scale and left more than 23,000 people dead, \r\n76,000 injured and at least 4 million otherwise \r\naffected. The scenario is different today, however. We \r\nhave developed policies, contingency plans and a \r\ngenuine institutional structure to address the \r\nconsequences of similar disasters. That represents \r\nsignificant progress with regard to disaster prevention \r\nand mitigation. Although the risk of earthquakes \r\npersists in various parts of the world — on a scale \r\nsimilar to or greater than in Guatemala — the number \r\nof victims and the economic losses are lower today. \r\nThat can be explained by the fact that assistance today \r\nis more reliable as a result of improved capacity to \r\nrespond, as well as because of a faster response time in \r\nproviding funding quickly on the basis of better \r\nunderstanding of actual needs and vulnerabilities. As a \r\nresult, we are moving towards a system that, while not \r\nperfect, is certainly better prepared, genuinely capable \r\nof helping people in need and more likely to be able to \r\nbe a part of efforts of States.  \r\n It is for that reason that we appreciate efforts to \r\nstrengthen the coordination of humanitarian assistance \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 6 \r\n \r\nin humanitarian emergencies and disasters on the part \r\nof the United Nations system, in particular the Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which \r\nhas certainly had a very intense year, but one replete \r\nwith significant achievements. \r\n My Government recognizes the value of the \r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations contained in his \r\nreports on strengthening of the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance. Many of \r\nthem are already being implemented in Guatemala \r\nthrough the office of The National Disaster Reduction \r\nCoordinator, and regionally throughout Central \r\nAmerica by the Coordination Centre for the Prevention \r\nof Natural Disasters in Central America.  \r\n It is also worth recalling that, in May 2007, \r\nGuatemala published a new version of the manual of \r\nits Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Centre. The \r\neffort to update the manual began with a review of the \r\ntext and an assessment of our experience during \r\nHurricane Stan in 2005. The main goal of the manual is \r\nto guide decision-making and information management \r\nin order to coordinate assistance and train all those \r\ninvolved in providing it during a humanitarian crisis. \r\n Addressing humanitarian emergencies must begin \r\nwith risk reduction and preventive efforts aimed at \r\nvulnerable populations. To that end, special attention \r\nshould also be paid to the issue of gender-based \r\nviolence committed during humanitarian emergencies. \r\nWe must also pay close attention to our cultural \r\ncharacteristics and specificities. The age-old \r\ncommunity-based traditions of indigenous peoples are \r\ncrucial to the success of the humanitarian crisis \r\nmanagement system as well as to the success of post-\r\ncrisis recovery, including repairing the social fabric. \r\n That leads me to underscore the crucial \r\nimportance — once again emphasized by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report — of providing \r\nhumanitarian access. It should be noted that \r\nhumanitarian access depends as much on the degree of \r\ndevelopment of local capacities as on personal \r\nrelationships on the ground. With regard to local \r\ncapacities, we must bear in mind the lack of \r\ninfrastructure in some countries, especially with regard \r\nto roads in certain regions, which complicates access \r\nand creates obstacles to reaching vulnerable \r\npopulations. We must also remember that access is not \r\nan end in itself; it is a tool in ensuring timely \r\nhumanitarian assistance to the ultimate beneficiaries.  \r\n Turning to the issue of financing the rapid \r\nresponse capacity of the United Nations system, we \r\nbelieve that important components are now in place, \r\nincluding the predictability of financing for \r\nhumanitarian emergencies through the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund (CERF). We note that \r\nCERF has met many of its goals since its inception. \r\nNevertheless, we must continue to maximize available \r\nresources, since such disasters, given their greater \r\nfrequency and intensity, deplete available resources \r\nand reduce response capacity. We must also continue to \r\nstrive to streamline procedures, increase training, \r\nharmonize reporting formats and improve \r\naccountability mechanisms. \r\n Finally, we recognize that today more than ever, \r\nas the Secretary-General notes in his report, \r\nstrengthening the coordination and effective planning \r\nof humanitarian assistance requires a genuine \r\ncommitment to cooperation among the various partners \r\nparticipating in the provision of humanitarian \r\nassistance. We therefore believe it important that we \r\nhold a dialogue on the role and complementarity of \r\nhumanitarian, political and peacekeeping actors. \r\n This year in particular, we are pleased to note the \r\nfirst meeting of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction in Geneva. It has given us a political forum \r\nfor discussing the reduction of disaster risk in all \r\nsectors and has made it easier to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, particularly as \r\nregards poverty reduction and environmental \r\nsustainability. Furthermore, we are gratified to \r\nparticipate in the Latin American efforts to evaluate the \r\npossibility of establishing a simplified system to \r\nrespond to emergencies and contingencies arising from \r\nnatural disasters, bearing in mind our countries’ \r\nvulnerability to the consequences of climate change. \r\nWe should also note the valuable momentum imparted \r\nto the organization of volunteers who contribute to \r\ndeveloping participatory social policies and to \r\nmitigating damage caused by natural disasters, taking \r\naccount of the regional network of humanitarian \r\nvolunteers created through the White Helmets Initiative \r\nas one of the tools of its formation. \r\n That is why the convening of this debate and the \r\nadoption of resolutions on this issue contribute to \r\nblazing trails for multilateral cooperation, which we \r\nbelieve to be the most appropriate and time-tested way \r\nto respond to the current and future challenges to \r\nhumanitarian assistance. \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n7 07-60509 \r\n \r\n Mr. Sorcar (Bangladesh): I am taking the floor \r\ntoday against the backdrop of a severe tropical cyclone \r\nthat has caused extensive damage in my country. The \r\ndisaster befell Bangladesh before it could recover from \r\ntwo rounds of massive flooding that inundated almost \r\nhalf the country just three months ago. \r\n I would like to record our deep appreciation to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly and to the \r\nrepresentatives who have conveyed their sympathies \r\nand assurances of support, in writing or in words, in \r\nthe hour of difficulty of our nation. We have forwarded \r\ntheir kind words to our capital, which no doubt will be \r\na source of strength and encouragement for our \r\nleadership and our people. \r\n The cyclone, named Sidr, hit Bangladesh, \r\nparticularly its south-western districts, on late \r\nThursday, 15 November, with the severity of a full \r\nblown category-four hurricane. It produced winds of up \r\nto 150 miles per hour at landfall. Tropical cyclones are \r\nno strangers to Bangladesh. Every year, the courageous \r\npeople brace for storms, but this time even we were \r\noverwhelmed by its force and the extent of the damage \r\nit caused. It was one of the top 10 fiercest cyclones in \r\nthe recorded history of the past 137 years. The extent \r\nof devastation has been huge. The official estimate of \r\nthe death toll has risen to 2,048 and is going up by the \r\nhour. Many are injured and quite a few are missing. All \r\nindications point to the sad possibility that the final \r\nnumber will be higher than what has been possible to \r\nconfirm officially. \r\n Even in difficult times we brace ourselves in \r\nhope. Many people died, but it could have been \r\nhigher — much higher. In 1991, for instance, when a \r\ncyclone of similar magnitude hit Bangladesh, more \r\nthan 140,000 people perished. Although we are \r\nnowhere near the final death count, this time it seems \r\nthat the extensive preparation of the Government, \r\nalong with other agencies that worked together, was \r\nsuccessful in averting a larger death toll. \r\n Cyclone Sidr originated in a depression in the \r\nBay of Bengal. It had a radius of 300 miles and an eye \r\nof 50 miles across. In the 48 hours before the landfall \r\nof the cyclone, about 3.2 million people were \r\nevacuated to designated shelters and other safe places. \r\nThat by itself was an enormous feat, as mass \r\nevacuation of densely populated coastal areas with \r\npoor communications is a huge challenge. However, \r\nextensive preparedness and timely action, which have \r\nbeen unreservedly appreciated by many, was \r\ninstrumental in avoiding a bigger catastrophe. \r\n In addition to the large number of deaths, the \r\ncyclone demolished houses, destroyed standing crops, \r\nfelled trees and damaged shrimp farms — a chief \r\nsource of livelihoods in the coastal areas. The \r\nmangrove forests of the Sudarbans, a World Heritage \r\nSite and a natural habitat of the famed royal bengal \r\ntiger, have been extensively damaged. Many of the \r\nwild animals are obviously in the same danger as \r\npeople. \r\n The complete damage assessment is still being \r\nawaited, though preliminary indications are that \r\n27 million people have been affected by the severe \r\nstorm. The Government is now focusing on emergency \r\nneeds: supply of non-food items, food, nutrition, water \r\nand sanitation, shelter and disease surveillance. \r\nMembers of the Defence Forces have been deployed \r\nand are working round the clock in rescue and other \r\noperations and immediate relief activities. Air Force \r\nhelicopters have been flying sorties with relief supplies \r\nto offshore islands and other inaccessible areas for the \r\npast three days. The Navy is also fully involved in \r\nrelief operations. Cash, food grains and other supplies \r\nare being allocated by the Government for assistance. \r\nThe longer-term perspective calls for the rehabilitation \r\nof livelihoods, infrastructure, health, educational and \r\nother services and increased shelter capacity.  \r\n The severe destruction and human death toll have \r\nprompted sympathy and assistance from many \r\ncountries. Many of our friends have come forward with \r\nsupport; the international response has been great. The \r\nUnited Nations country team, the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \r\nand many non-governmental organizations have \r\nprovided support to the Government through extensive \r\nemergency response precautions, including mobilizing \r\nin-country staff and prepositioned relief stocks across \r\nsouthern Bangladesh. \r\n Many development partners, including the \r\nEuropean Union, China, France, Germany, Japan, \r\nSaudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom \r\nand the United States, to name a few, have made early \r\npledges of assistance. We are receiving commitments \r\nfrom others countries, which are standing by the \r\naffected population of Bangladesh in its struggle. We \r\nare thankful to all countries, organizations and entities \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 8 \r\n \r\nthat have stepped forward with assurance, material and \r\nmoral, in our time of great difficulty. \r\n We received a statement issued today by the \r\nspokesperson of the Foreign Ministry, which says that \r\n “While the resilient people of Bangladesh \r\nand the Government are making all efforts to \r\ncope with the adversities, at this time we will \r\nwelcome support from the international \r\ncommunity, as before, through the Government, \r\nto help mitigate the effects of the disaster.” \r\n Time will not permit me to dwell too long on the \r\nreports of the Secretary-General. I would, however, \r\nlike to add a few words concerning the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund (CERF). From its \r\nestablishment in March 2006, it has been a mainstay of \r\nemergency response. According to the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/62/72), the Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator committed $259.3 million to 331 life-\r\nsaving humanitarian projects in 35 countries in the year \r\n2006 alone. The Fund was also utilized in response to \r\nsudden-onset disasters and crises in 24 countries, with \r\n59 per cent of funding going to rapid response to crises \r\nin Africa. \r\n We believe the mechanism deserves to be \r\nstrengthened, as it is the mainstay in many emergency \r\nsituations. In the short span of time since its launch in \r\n2006, the upgraded CERF has proven its usefulness in \r\nmany parts of the world, including my own country. \r\nWe hope that the Fund will continue to receive strong \r\nsupport from Member States, in terms of long-term \r\npolitical support and increased resource flow. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): It is \r\nunderstandable that I should want to express our \r\nsolidarity and sympathy with the people of Bangladesh \r\non the recent natural disaster, which caused human and \r\neconomic losses.  \r\n At the outset, I would like to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on the \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations \r\n(A/62/87), which covers multifaceted activities of all \r\nUnited Nations institutions in that field. As the report \r\nindicates, the further aggravation of existing \r\nemergencies and the increase in the incidence and \r\nseverity of disasters caused by natural hazards confirm \r\nthe need to remain focused on strengthening the \r\ncapacity of humanitarian actors to address the effects \r\nof emergencies on the lives and livelihoods of millions \r\nof people. \r\n We believe that strengthening cooperation in \r\nresponding to natural disasters and destruction under \r\nthe umbrella of the United Nations in accordance with \r\nthe Hyogo Declaration and Framework for Action \r\n2005-2015 and related General Assembly resolutions, \r\nshould remain one of the Organization’s priority tasks. \r\n Kazakhstan welcomes the positive results of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund’s work during the \r\npast year with respect to voluntary contributions by \r\nStates Members of the United Nations as well as \r\nequitable, timely and efficient distribution of these \r\nfunds. \r\n We believe it is important to increase the \r\ncoordination and cooperation among United Nations \r\nbodies, other international organizations and \r\nGovernments on the national level, in order to prevent \r\nand overcome the consequences of natural disasters for \r\nthe sake of saving many people’s lives. In this regard, \r\nwe attach particular importance to the establishment by \r\nthe United Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) of a Central Asian \r\ndisaster response coordination centre in Kazakhstan. \r\nAs a further step in strengthening the standby \r\ncapacities of the United Nations in the region, we \r\npropose to establish in Kazakhstan a network of \r\nwarehouses for the Central Asia region to make relief \r\nassets readily available for deployment. \r\n Establishing partnerships, creating capacities \r\nwithin national and local governments, regional \r\norganizations and civil society groups, and better \r\ndefining needs are critical investments in addressing \r\nhumanitarian vulnerability more effectively in the \r\ncoming years. \r\n For Kazakhstan, whose territory has been hit by \r\nnumerous man-made and ecological disasters, such as \r\nthe dying Aral Sea and the former Semipalatinsk \r\nnuclear testing site, solving those problems is an \r\nabsolute priority. The humanitarian, social and \r\neconomic consequences of those disasters continue to \r\naffect the process of sustainable development not only \r\nfor Kazakhstan but for the Central Asian region as a \r\nwhole. \r\n The seriousness of the situation around the Aral \r\nSea highlights the need to take specific steps at the \r\ninternational level to solve the problem. By the 1990s, \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n9 07-60509 \r\n \r\nthe Aral Sea, once a large internal sea, had lost three \r\nfourths of its water. That has spelled disaster for \r\nmillions of people living around it. The salt from the \r\nexposed seabed is being sprinkled over the entire \r\nEurasian continent, damaging its environment. \r\n The countries of the Central Asian region have \r\ndone a lot to rehabilitate the Sea. However, without \r\nconsolidation of the efforts of the world community, \r\nthis problem cannot be solved. In this regard, we \r\npropose giving the International Fund for Saving the \r\nAral Sea the status of a United Nations institution, and \r\nwe call for an international partnership to develop and \r\nadopt a package of measures related to the provision of \r\nfinancial, technical and humanitarian assistance by the \r\nUnited Nations, its specialized agencies and \r\nprogrammes as well as by multilateral financial \r\ninstitutions, in order to rehabilitate the Aral Sea. \r\n This year, the international community marks the \r\ntwenty-first anniversary of the tragic accident at \r\nChernobyl, the symbol of a catastrophe on the \r\nplanetary scale. The consequences of nuclear radiation \r\nare truly tragic. Millions of people in Belarus, the \r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine have been affected by \r\nnuclear contamination. This pollution has also affected \r\nother countries in Europe. The effects of the radiation \r\nfallout continue to have a negative impact on the \r\nenvironment on an even broader geographical scale. \r\n We in Kazakhstan are firmly convinced that the \r\nChernobyl issue should not be considered to be the \r\nexclusive problem of those countries that were directly \r\naffected by the accident. At that time, my country, like \r\nmany others, belonged to one country, and many \r\npeople from the former republics of the Soviet \r\nUnion — including 30,000 from Kazakhstan — took \r\npart in the rescue operation. Many of them lost their \r\nlives. Many of them still suffer from the consequences \r\nof radiation. The Government of Kazakhstan is taking \r\nmeasures to assist those people who participated in the \r\nrescue operations in Chernobyl and has quadrupled the \r\nspecial monthly State allowances for that category of \r\npersons.  \r\n But much remains to be done. The Chernobyl \r\ncatastrophe is a global challenge and it should receive \r\na global response. Kazakhstan commends the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations over the years to eliminate the \r\neffects of the Chernobyl disaster in Belarus, the \r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine. The international \r\ncommunity has provided the affected countries with \r\nsubstantial assistance, although it remains inadequate \r\nto their real needs. There must therefore be joint, \r\ncoordinated efforts on a broad scale to provide \r\nassistance for the rehabilitation of the affected \r\npopulations and for mitigating the environmental, \r\neconomic and social consequences of the disaster. \r\n Twenty-one years after that tragic day, the \r\nChernobyl catastrophe remains a serious problem for \r\nthe entire international community. We are convinced \r\nthat only by combining our efforts and capacities can \r\nwe eliminate the terrible consequences of the accident \r\nand provide a better future for the millions who have \r\nsuffered its effects. We hope that today’s discussion \r\nwill help mobilize sustained assistance by the \r\ninternational community to the affected people of \r\nBelarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike my first words to convey the appreciation of the \r\nGovernment of Mexico to the international community \r\nfor the expressions of solidarity and support that we \r\nhave received regarding the recent flooding in the \r\nstates of Tabasco and Chiapas in the south of the \r\ncountry, which have over the past few weeks affected \r\nmore than a million people. \r\n Governments as well as public and private \r\ninternational institutions have supported the intensive \r\nefforts of the Government of President Felipe \r\nCalderón, and those of local authorities and civil \r\nsociety as a whole, to help our affected compatriots. \r\nWe have made progress in addressing the urgent needs \r\nof the affected population and in identifying the \r\nfinancial and technical resources we need to adopt \r\nappropriate measures. \r\n Unfortunately, the emergency is not yet over and \r\nwe are beginning to see the consequences of one of the \r\nworst climate-related disasters that our country has \r\nexperienced. The economic and social impact on the \r\naffected areas will continue to be felt indefinitely. It is \r\ncalculated that some 350,000 people have lost \r\neverything and are now in a situation of extreme \r\nvulnerability. On top of that, they face multiple \r\nchallenges regarding health, housing, food and \r\ninfrastructure. Thus, given the magnitude of the \r\ndisaster, we must rely on the support of the \r\ninternational community to complement the actions \r\ntaken by our Government. \r\n As a country that has been buffeted by natural \r\ndisasters on numerous occasions, Mexico deeply \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 10 \r\n \r\nappreciates the disaster response work of the United \r\nNations, in particular that of the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in \r\nchannelling humanitarian assistance. Responding to \r\nMexico’s appeal, the United Nations system sent a \r\nUnited Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination \r\nTeam from OCHA, whose role it is to support a \r\nresponse, in contact with federal and local authorities, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society. The \r\nvarious agencies in the system are already moving \r\nemergency resources for humanitarian assistance and, \r\nalong with our Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, \r\ncoordinating international aid to the affected areas. \r\n My delegation reiterates its firm commitment to \r\nefforts by the international community to reduce the \r\nrisk of natural disasters and considers that, given the \r\ncorrelation between these and sustainable development, \r\nit is of fundamental importance to strengthen \r\npreventive strategies. We express our solidarity with \r\nthose countries that are currently facing similar dire \r\ncircumstances, such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic \r\nand most recently Bangladesh; we are saddened by the \r\ntragedy there. \r\n In spite of technological and scientific progress in \r\nthe detection and prevention of natural hazards, we \r\nmust continue to work intensively to identify and \r\nmitigate risks as well as the increase the preparedness \r\nof society, giving priority to the most vulnerable \r\nsectors. No single plan will completely address the \r\neffects of such phenomena, but it is possible to \r\nintensify, consolidate and continue to develop \r\nprevention mechanisms, including the development \r\nand ingraining of a culture of self-protection. \r\n For that purpose, we deem it essential to \r\nstrengthen coordination among Governments, civil \r\nsociety and international humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment agencies. We also believe that the United \r\nNations has a central role to play in the implementation \r\nof the Hyogo Framework for Action, which needs to be \r\nstrengthened through concrete measures in order to \r\nensure coherence among programmes carried out by \r\nthe various United Nations entities and in order to \r\noptimize the allocation of available resources.  \r\n On numerous occasions, Mexico has stressed the \r\nimportance of strengthening multilateral mechanisms \r\nthat respond to humanitarian emergencies in order to \r\nmake them more effective and expeditious in offering \r\nassistance to the victims of these phenomena. The \r\ncreation of the Central Emergency Response Fund \r\n(CERF) has been, without a doubt, one of the most \r\nsignificant steps taken in that regard. We are pleased to \r\nsee that, less than two years after its launch, results \r\nhave met expectations. Mexico is a founding \r\ncontributor to CERF, and this year it renewed its \r\ncontribution, thus confirming its commitment to a more \r\ntransparent and effective humanitarian system, focused \r\non the needs in the field, including those emergency \r\nsituations that lack visibility. \r\n Concerning the emergency situation in Tabasco \r\nand Chiapas, I would like to inform the Assembly that \r\nthe relevant authorities of the Government of Mexico \r\nhave accepted the programme of activities to be \r\nundertaken with resources from the Fund to support the \r\ndesign of projects related to health, water and \r\nsanitation, as well as to coordination, evaluation, \r\nplanning, monitoring, shelter and logistic coordination. \r\nIn this respect, consultations regarding the modalities \r\nof implementation are under way with CERF. \r\n Along a different line of thought, we consider \r\nthat the international community’s efforts to improve \r\nthe efficiency and coordination of humanitarian \r\nassistance will continue to be limited as long as there is \r\nresistance to guaranteeing humanitarian workers \r\nsecurity and access to populations in need, particularly \r\nin cases where States lack the capacity to offer \r\nprotection. The issue of access is a cornerstone of \r\nresolution 46/182 and a sine qua non for a solid \r\nmultilateral humanitarian system capable of alleviating \r\nthe suffering of the millions of persons around the \r\nworld who, directly or indirectly, face the \r\nconsequences of humanitarian crises. \r\n Unfortunately, civilians are recurrent targets of \r\nwarfare. The violence they suffer takes the form of \r\nterrible phenomena such as kidnappings, child \r\nexploitation and violence and sexual abuse against \r\nwomen and girls. Hence, we have the moral obligation \r\nto implement concrete measures to enable the \r\nOrganization to alleviate these sufferings. Mexico is \r\ntherefore concerned by the fact that the issue of access \r\nto civilians in armed conflicts is being interpreted as a \r\nquestion of interference without considering that this is \r\na fundamental human right of the victims and an \r\nobligation, under international law, of all parties. \r\n The protection of human beings affected by \r\nhumanitarian emergencies, whether they be natural \r\ndisasters or more complex emergencies, should not be \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n11 07-60509 \r\n \r\na controversial issue and should always constitute a \r\ncommon objective towards which Governments and \r\ninternational organizations work together side by side. \r\n Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda): On behalf of my \r\ndelegation and on my own account, I want to express \r\ndeep condolences to the Government and the people of \r\nBangladesh at this very difficult moment. \r\n We welcome the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nhumanitarian assistance and rehabilitation for selected \r\ncountries and regions, contained in document \r\nA/62/310. The Rwanda delegation will focus its \r\nstatement on assistance to survivors of the 1994 \r\ngenocide in Rwanda, particularly orphans, widows and \r\nvictims of sexual violence. \r\n The tragic events that occurred in Rwanda in \r\n1994 are among the darkest and most dreadful in \r\nhuman history. Over 1 million lives were lost, and tens \r\nof thousands suffered horrific physical and \r\npsychological abuse and trauma. Over 300,000 \r\nchildren were orphaned, tens of thousands of women \r\nwere widowed and thousands contracted HIV/AIDS as \r\na result of rape. \r\n Regrettably, the international community did not \r\ntake timely and decisive action to prevent the tragic \r\nevents from unfolding or to stop them when they had \r\nstarted. My delegation’s understanding is that the \r\ninternational community’s responsibility to protect \r\npopulations from genocide entails a responsibility to \r\nprevent genocide from occurring, a responsibility to \r\nprotect if prevention fails, and a responsibility to \r\nrebuild if protection fails. The agenda sub-item before \r\nus enables the United Nations system and the wider \r\ninternational community to exercise their responsibility \r\nto rebuild Rwanda after the genocide. \r\n My delegation welcomes the recognition in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report of the progress that has been \r\nmade in rebuilding Rwanda after the genocide. The \r\nRwandan people have, for the most part, decided to put \r\ntheir painful history behind them and to rebuild their \r\ncountry on a solid foundation based on reconciliation, \r\njustice, good governance, development, human rights \r\nand democracy. We commend the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations system for their \r\nsupport for Rwanda over the years. \r\n As the Secretary-General’s report correctly points \r\nout, significant challenges remain, particularly among \r\nvulnerable groups such as orphans and widows. There \r\nis a need for continued support to those vulnerable \r\ngroups of people, particularly in terms of assistance in \r\nshelter, health care and education for orphans; medical \r\ncare and treatment for victims of sexual violence, \r\nincluding HIV-positive victims; trauma and \r\npsychological counselling and skills training; and \r\nmicrocredit programmes aimed at promoting self-\r\nsufficiency and alleviating poverty among the \r\nvulnerable groups. \r\n We wish to commend the Department of Public \r\nInformation for its work on Rwanda genocide victim \r\nremembrance and education, conducted in accordance \r\nwith General Assembly resolution 60/225. A successful \r\nexhibit took place at United Nations Headquarters in \r\nApril this year to mark the thirteenth commemoration \r\nof the Rwanda genocide and was opened by the \r\nSecretary-General. Similar activities took place in \r\nseveral other cities around the world. \r\n There is a need for that programme to be \r\ncontinued into the next biennium. The challenges \r\nfacing the world today — rising xenophobia, racism \r\nand ethnic and religious tensions — require that the \r\nlessons of the Rwanda genocide be widely taught and \r\ndisseminated among all people, particularly the young. \r\nWe therefore call upon all delegations to support the \r\nextension of the programme for the biennium \r\n2008-2009. \r\n Finally, I would like to draw the attention of \r\nMember States to the decision of the Security Council \r\nto begin completing the work of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 2008, in accordance \r\nwith its Completion Strategy. While we commend the \r\nTribunal for the work it has conducted so far, we \r\nshould recall that there is still a lot left to be done, \r\nincluding the completion of many trials. There are also \r\nresidual issues relating to genocide survivors, in \r\nparticular witness and victim support and protection, \r\ncapacity-building for the Rwandan judiciary, and the \r\ntransfer of Court documents and records to Rwanda to \r\ncontribute to genocide victim remembrance and \r\neducation. Those issues are inextricably linked to the \r\nagenda sub-item under discussion, so we look forward \r\nto the support of delegations in addressing those issues \r\nin the context of a resolution on the sub-item. \r\n Mr. Oosthuizen (South Africa): First of all, let \r\nme, like other representatives, express South Africa’s \r\ndeepest sympathy to Bangladesh, which was subject to \r\nserious humanitarian disasters recently. \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 12 \r\n \r\n My delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation for the reports of the Secretary-General \r\nprovided under item 71, which offer a useful analysis \r\nof the challenges still facing the international \r\nhumanitarian community and provide some \r\nrecommendations to be considered by the General \r\nAssembly for our deliberations on this matter.  \r\n At the outset, we would like to thank the United \r\nNations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs (OCHA), and particularly its Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. John Holmes, for the work done to \r\nstrengthen the coordination of humanitarian assistance \r\nin the United Nations, sometimes in extremely difficult \r\nsituations. \r\n Effective humanitarian coordination is of utmost \r\nimportance if we want to succeed in assisting the \r\nvulnerable. The increasing number of organizations, \r\neach with their varying skills and priorities involved in \r\nthe important task of providing humanitarian \r\nassistance, further highlights the need to ensure that all \r\nthose efforts are provided in an effective and \r\ncoordinated manner in order to prevent duplication and \r\na waste of resources. We therefore look forward to a \r\nfurther evaluation of the impact and possible success of \r\nthe cluster approach as one of the measures to provide \r\nbetter leadership and to prevent gaps in providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance. \r\n The Secretary-General also rightly alludes to the \r\ncritical role of partnerships and international \r\ncooperation in providing assistance during complex \r\nhumanitarian emergencies. Those partnerships, under \r\nthe leadership of national Governments, could also \r\ninclude the engagement of regional organizations to \r\nhelp improve humanitarian responses and standby \r\ncapacities.  \r\n We also have to acknowledge that, due to the \r\nincrease in the scope and severity of the impact of \r\nsome humanitarian emergencies, many developing \r\ncountries do not always have the capacity to deal with \r\ndisaster preparedness, risk reduction and the impact of \r\nthose emergencies. My delegation would therefore \r\nagain call on the United Nations humanitarian system \r\nto continue not only to assist Member States in their \r\nefforts to improve their local and national capacities, \r\nbut also to assist regional organizations, in order to \r\nassure a regional response where emergencies \r\ntranscends national borders. That would assist Member \r\nStates in making optimal use of resources in preparing \r\nand responding to emergencies, as well as in \r\nsupporting the resilience of societies in post-\r\nemergency situations. \r\n South Africa, as host to one of OCHA’s regional \r\noffices, is aware of the important work the Office is \r\ndoing in the region to assist countries facing the \r\nchallenges of droughts, floods and food insecurity. \r\nContinued financial support to the Regional Office for \r\nSouthern Africa would enable it to improve its support \r\nto countries in Southern Africa and to fulfil its \r\nmandate. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General further \r\nhighlights that, despite the many international \r\ninstruments emphasizing the importance of building \r\ncapacity to respond to disasters, such capacity remains \r\nconstrained, mainly due to a lack of funding. Improved \r\nfinancial support is not limited to capacity-building for \r\nnational Governments, but also extends to the United \r\nNations humanitarian system. South Africa proudly \r\nsupports the Central Emergency Relieve Fund (CERF) \r\nand will continue to do so. At the same time, it eagerly \r\nlooks forward to the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nenvisioned for 2008, to measure the successes and \r\nchallenges facing CERF. \r\n South Africa also recognizes the important role \r\nthat all parties in complex humanitarian emergencies \r\nshould play in ensuring the safe access of humanitarian \r\npersonnel when providing assistance to vulnerable \r\ncommunities, bearing in mind the need for the \r\nhumanitarian community to respect the culture, \r\ntraditions and practices of the countries in which they \r\noperate. Furthermore, my delegation remains \r\nconvinced of the need to protect civilians during \r\ncomplex humanitarian emergencies, and also calls on \r\nall role-players to address gender-based violence and to \r\nmake all possible efforts to ensure that adequate \r\nmeasures are put into place to prevent, promptly \r\ninvestigate and persecute acts of gender-based \r\nviolence. \r\n It is essential, however, to remember that \r\nhumanitarian assistance should be provided on the \r\nbasis of the principles of humanity, neutrality, \r\nimpartiality and independence, as enshrined in General \r\nAssembly resolution 46/182 and other General \r\nAssembly resolutions. \r\n The report contained in document A/62/82, \r\nentitled “Assistance to the Palestinian People” contains \r\na description of efforts made by United Nations \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n13 07-60509 \r\n \r\nagencies, in cooperation with Palestinian and donor \r\ncounterparts, to support the Palestinian civilian \r\npopulation and institutions. We commend the work of \r\nthe United Nations in that regard and would like to \r\nurge the international donor community to continue its \r\ngenerous support. We need to prevent a further \r\ndeterioration in the quality of life inside the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories and a decline of the Palestinian \r\neconomy, which could only lead to an increase in the \r\neconomic, social and humanitarian needs of the \r\nPalestinian population. In that, regard we need to stress \r\nthat the crossing points must remain open in order to \r\nallow the Palestinian people to receive food, medicines \r\nand other important items, especially fuel. It is \r\nimportant that humanitarian assistance be delivered to \r\nprevent further suffering and to allow the Palestinian \r\npeople to live and work in dignity. \r\n The report contained in document A/62/310 \r\nhighlights the current challenges to the delivery of both \r\nhumanitarian and relief and rehabilitation assistance by \r\nthe United Nations and its partners to countries \r\naffected by various types of emergencies, particularly \r\nin Africa. South Africa would like to encourage the \r\nUnited Nations system, in close cooperation with the \r\nrespective national Governments, not only properly to \r\nidentify the specific needs to address the challenges \r\nthose countries face, but also to provide the appropriate \r\nmeans to implement proposals that will help those \r\ncountries reach their development goals. It is evident \r\nfrom the report that, in many instances, Governments \r\nhave taken responsibility in identifying challenges, but \r\nthat international support, in its various forms, is \r\nneeded to assist Governments to help alleviate the \r\nplight of the vulnerable in their respective countries. \r\nWe should accept that responsibility. \r\n We are also aware that, after the period of \r\nimmediate emergency relief has passed, there is often a \r\nbigger and more arduous task ahead: to rebuild and \r\nbring normalcy back to the affected populations. We \r\ntherefore appreciate the Secretary-General’s report \r\nentitled “International cooperation on humanitarian \r\nassistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief \r\nto development” and would like to highlight the critical \r\nelement of continued involvement of all relevant role-\r\nplayers in the early recovery phase, with the aim of \r\ncreating favourable conditions for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The importance of finding lasting \r\nsolutions to wars and conflicts would also clearly \r\ncontribute to the sustainable development of countries. \r\nWe further call upon relevant humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment actors to strengthen tools and \r\nmechanisms to ensure that early recovery needs are \r\nconsidered as part of the planning and implementation \r\nof humanitarian response activities. The importance of \r\nsufficient funding to help affected communities in their \r\nrecovery efforts also remains critical. \r\n In conclusion, South Africa remains firm in its \r\nunwavering commitment to improve the working of the \r\nhumanitarian system in an effort to provide better \r\nassistance faster, in a more coordinated and predictable \r\nmanner, and based on the principle of partnerships. It is \r\nour hope the international community will continue to \r\nprovide assistance in a manner that will take the needs \r\nof the affected communities into consideration, and not \r\nonly based on financial considerations. \r\n Mr. Rees (United States of America): The United \r\nStates continues to support a stronger and more \r\neffective international response to humanitarian crises. \r\nOver the past two years, we have been proud to help \r\napproximately 1 million African refugees to return \r\nhome, thanks in large part to collective activism, \r\ndemocratic action and financial assistance. The United \r\nStates is also working actively with other Governments \r\nto resolve the protracted situation of refugees, such as \r\nthe Bhutanese in Nepal. In particular, we have \r\nresponded to the joint Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees-UNICEF appeal for \r\nthe education of Iraqi children in Jordan and Syria with \r\n$39 million to date, and we have made almost \r\n$200 million available in 2007 to assist displaced \r\nIraqis. \r\n The United States is conducting active \r\nhumanitarian diplomacy critical to improving \r\nconditions for beneficiaries of assistance around the \r\nworld — in Africa, the Middle East, the Americas, Asia \r\nand Europe. We recognize the importance of \r\npreparedness for all types of disasters, we believe in \r\naccountability and quality in humanitarian assistance, \r\nand we emphasize that international assistance must \r\nsupport and strengthen national and community \r\ncapacities, rather than undermine or override them. \r\n We have again seen a year of activity and \r\nchange — change that we hope will prove to represent \r\nprogress — in the realm of humanitarian reform. \r\nExamples include the application and strengthening of \r\nthe cluster approach to respond to the needs of the \r\ninternally displaced, the humanitarian coordinator \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 14 \r\n \r\nsystem, and the Central Emergency Response Fund \r\n(CERF). \r\n The United States continues to see progress in the \r\nuse of the cluster approach and the consolidation of \r\nsupport among donors, implementing agencies and \r\naffected States. Clarity of responsibility through the \r\nassignment of coordination roles for humanitarian \r\nactivity has strengthened overall United Nations \r\nleadership and responsiveness in humanitarian crises. \r\nWe continue to stress the importance of the \r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations at all \r\nlevels of coordination, including the cluster approach.  \r\n In its first full year of activity, the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund has proved to be an \r\neffective tool for rapid response to humanitarian \r\nemergencies and has provided critical early funding for \r\nUnited Nations operational engagement in emerging \r\ncrises. It also continues to provide a valuable access \r\npoint for the participation of new donors in global \r\nhumanitarian operations. While we continue to assess \r\nCERF’s value in addressing “under-funded \r\nemergencies”, we remain open to discussion and \r\ndevelopment of clearer definitions and criteria to \r\ngovern disbursements in those situations.  \r\n Unfortunately, protracted civil conflicts continue \r\nto create some of the worst situations of forced \r\ndisplacement in our era. Renewed displacement in the \r\neastern Congo and in the Sudan’s Darfur province are \r\ntragic reminders that civilians are at times deliberately \r\ntargeted by some of the belligerent parties in a conflict. \r\nDespite improved systemic responsiveness to internally \r\ndisplaced persons, access remains a key issue. \r\nHumanitarian agencies cannot assist people they \r\ncannot reach.  \r\n The safety and security of humanitarian workers, \r\nlike those of the civilians they seek to assist, is often \r\njeopardized, at times deliberately, by some \r\nbelligerents. As the United States delegation has stated \r\npreviously, without full and unhindered access for \r\nhumanitarian actors, even the most robust response \r\neffort will fail to meet emergency needs. Deliberate \r\nattacks on humanitarian workers remain a significant \r\nimpediment to life-saving aid in many crises, and we \r\nmust all work together to guarantee the safety and \r\nsecurity of relief workers, as well as of civilians.  \r\n I want to reaffirm the strong support of the \r\nUnited States for neutral, impartial, independent and \r\nrobust responses to humanitarian needs around the \r\nglobe. To that end, we look forward to working with \r\nSweden as co-chairs of the Good Humanitarian \r\nDonorship programme and to working with other \r\nStates on strengthening needs-based assessment, \r\nimproving coordination at the central and field levels, \r\nand reviewing best practices and performance \r\nmeasurement. We would welcome other donor \r\nGovernments, including new or emerging donors, to \r\njoin the initiative and incorporate its principles and \r\nbest practices into their policies as well. \r\n In conclusion, the United States would like to \r\njoin others in expressing our deep sympathy to the \r\npeople of Bangladesh for the loss of life and the \r\ndamage caused by the recent cyclone. That disaster and \r\nother humanitarian emergencies present grave \r\nchallenges, but they also bring to mind the collective \r\nstrength of what we like to call our “international \r\ncommunity”.  \r\n We must measure the effectiveness of our efforts \r\nin providing humanitarian aid not by how many \r\nstatements or plans we make — not even by how many \r\ndollars we spend — but by how many lives we save \r\nand by how many people, their lives devastated by \r\nunspeakable natural or man-made disasters, have had \r\ntheir suffering alleviated and their burdens lightened. \r\nBy uniting in the face of dramatic adversity, as the \r\ninternational community did following the 2004 \r\ntsunami and in response to the earthquake in Pakistan, \r\nwe can save lives and help the afflicted. We hope the \r\nUnited Nations, and particularly the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, will continue to \r\nplay a central role in galvanizing this cooperative \r\nresponse. \r\n Mr. Tharyat (Indonesia): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing, on behalf of the people and the \r\nGovernment of Indonesia to the people and \r\nGovernment of Bangladesh, our deepest sympathy and \r\nsolidarity with respect to the recent disaster that hit the \r\ncountry. \r\n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive and detailed reports, particularly \r\nthat on strengthening emergency relief, rehabilitation, \r\nreconstruction, recovery and prevention in the \r\naftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster, as \r\ncontained in document A/62/83. \r\n As one of the victims of the Indian Ocean \r\ntsunami disaster, Indonesia is highly appreciative of \r\nand deeply encouraged by the continued attention of \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n15 07-60509 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations and the international community to \r\nthat issue. We join other delegations in expressing \r\nappreciation for the efforts undertaken by \r\nGovernments, international organizations, civil society \r\nand the private sector in providing support in \r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief, and in assisting \r\ncountries to make the transition from relief to \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Nowadays, rarely do we see a month go by \r\nwithout a major disaster reported in the public media. \r\nThe increased incidence of disasters, as reported in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report in document A/62/323, \r\nsuggests that the frequency and intensity will likely \r\ncontinue into the future. That creates a major \r\nchallenge, particularly for developing countries, in \r\npursuing national and international development \r\nobjectives. \r\n While natural hazards do not discriminate, it is \r\nimportant to recall that the poor are the most \r\nvulnerable and often endure the greatest cost. In effect, \r\nas the report rightly emphasizes, disasters contribute to \r\nvulnerability and persistent poverty, which later \r\nundermine efforts in development and the achievement \r\nof the international development goals. The carnage of \r\nthe Indian Ocean tsunami disaster three years ago \r\nprofoundly demonstrates the high vulnerability of poor \r\ncommunities to natural disasters. It also underlines the \r\nimportance of paying serious attention not only to \r\nemergency relief, but also to the disaster risk reduction \r\nrequired as part of development efforts. \r\n Viewed in that context, while countries affected \r\nby the tsunami disaster, including Indonesia, on the \r\nwhole have made progress in their reconstruction \r\nefforts, it will still take many more years to attend to \r\ndisaster risks to affected communities. Furthermore, \r\nalongside the ongoing efforts to rebuild and recover \r\nfrom the tsunami, the main mission now is to rebuild \r\nbetter. The survivors of the disaster not only expect the \r\nrecovery efforts not simply to restore communities to \r\ntheir pre-tsunami conditions, but they also desire \r\ngreater capacity to be established and to be prepared \r\nfor future calamities. \r\n Let me also add that, as part of the reconstruction \r\nefforts, it is important that the valuable lessons learned \r\nbe shared as much as possible. In our experience \r\nduring the tsunami and the reconstruction of the \r\naffected areas, one of the main lessons learned was the \r\nimportance of close coordination on the ground, from \r\nthe emergency phase to the present phase of \r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction. \r\n The tsunami-affected countries, although facing \r\ndifferent recovery timetables, still share the common \r\nchallenge of long-term recovery. In that connection, I \r\nwould like to emphasize the following. \r\n First, while tsunami affected countries have \r\nprogressed in rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts, \r\nthe support of the international community, donor \r\ncountries and financial institutions, as well as the \r\nprivate sector and civil society, is still very crucial in \r\nthe medium- and long-term. Secondly, continuing the \r\nobjective of rebuilding better is essential to the \r\naffected communities, particularly in improving the \r\nquality of and strengthening local capacity in disaster \r\nmanagement. Thirdly, prevention efforts through \r\ntsunami early warning arrangements in the Indian \r\nOcean and South-East Asia should be continually \r\nevaluated and strengthened. \r\n In the light of those considerations, Indonesia \r\nwill introduce a draft resolution entitled “Strengthening \r\nemergency relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and \r\nprevention in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean \r\ntsunami disaster”. The proposed text follows from \r\nprevious resolutions on this issue, and hence seeks the \r\ngenerous support and sponsorship of Member States. \r\n Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my sincere thanks to all the delegations that \r\nactively took part in the negotiations on the past \r\nresolution, as well as to the representatives of the \r\nSecretariat for their valuable advice. We look forward \r\nto the Assembly’s continued support. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): Permit \r\nme at the outset to express, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment of Colombia, our deepest sympathy and \r\nsolidarity with the Government and the people of \r\nBangladesh on the loss of life and suffering caused by \r\nthe cyclone that recently struck that country. \r\n My delegation takes note of the reports submitted \r\nby the Secretary-General at the sixty-second session on \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations. \r\n Colombia welcomes the important humanitarian \r\nrole played by United Nations agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes in various regions of the world. My \r\ndelegation encourages the system to continue to \r\nstrengthen that mission, with full respect for the \r\nguiding principles of humanitarian assistance. In \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 16 \r\n \r\nparticular, we must uphold the neutral and impartial \r\nnature of humanitarianism and respect the principles of \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the \r\nprimary role that the State must play in organizing, \r\ncoordinating and implementing the provision of \r\nhumanitarian assistance on its territory. We must bear \r\nin mind that it is primarily up to States to exercise \r\nleadership in this area. My delegation notes with \r\nsatisfaction that the reports refer to the importance of \r\nimproving relationships with national authorities and \r\nof strengthening local capacities. Such references are \r\nfound in analysis concerning disaster situations and the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian assistance. \r\n It is important that humanitarian entities — in \r\nparticular the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs and its subsidiary entities — \r\nincreasingly highlight the role of affected States in this \r\narea. If we are to find lasting and effective solutions to \r\nhumanitarian situations, it is important not only that we \r\nstrengthen inter-agency coordination, but also, and in \r\nparticular, that we ensure their coordination with \r\nGovernment entities. Thus, humanitarian cooperation \r\ncan be tailored to the structures, plans and programmes \r\nof beneficiary States, providing coordinated assistance \r\nand better responses and achieving effective coverage \r\nwithout duplication of efforts. \r\n This also applies to the cluster approach. In that \r\ncontext, the Secretary-General indicates the need to \r\nenhance support for national and local authorities and \r\nstructures in the humanitarian field. Colombia wishes \r\nto reiterate that, while this approach is the subject of \r\nintergovernmental analysis within the United Nations, \r\ntogether with other issues of reform and system-wide \r\ncoherence, its implementation should be promoted only \r\nwhen States themselves request and authorize such \r\nimplementation. \r\n We must also improve information systems in \r\norder to achieve more effective results in this area. \r\nWith regard to needs assessment, coordination with \r\nGovernments is also important, for two main reasons. \r\nFirst, it helps States to develop their own needs-\r\nassessment systems, which they need so that they can \r\ndefine their own programmes and develop a sense of \r\nownership of their activities. Secondly, when national \r\ninstitutions have reliable and developed information \r\nsystems, their assessments should serve as a basis for \r\ndetermining existing needs and the most appropriate \r\nassistance activities for each context. \r\n Humanitarian assistance should contribute to the \r\ndesign and implementation of processes that enable us \r\nto repair the social fabric of affected populations and to \r\nassist in the development of economic structures that \r\nguarantee sustainability once the critical difficulties \r\nhave been overcome. Humanitarian assistance should \r\nalso be based on State coordination. \r\n Colombia has programmes that assist disaster \r\nvictims and provide comprehensive support to persons \r\ndisplaced by situations of violence. Those programmes \r\nincorporate the relevant international standards and \r\ninclude the components of prevention, early warning, \r\nemergency humanitarian assistance, access to State \r\nsocial services and programmes and support for social \r\nand economic stabilization. \r\n The assistance plan for persons displaced by \r\nsituations of violence contains an additional important \r\ncomponent: protection for human rights and voluntary \r\nreturns. The plan is implemented in a decentralized \r\nmanner and includes a beneficiary registration system \r\nthat has gradually been improved to correct identified \r\nshortcomings. The 2007-2010 budget for the plan’s \r\nimplementation totals approximately $500 million per \r\nyear. Additionally, in the context of demobilizing \r\nillegal armed groups, we are promoting a strategy \r\naimed at compensating victims, which is essential to \r\nrebuild the lives of displaced persons. \r\n Because emergencies can exceed the capacity to \r\nact, Colombia complements its efforts with \r\ninternational cooperation activities. Various agencies of \r\nthe United Nations system, other Governments, the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and various \r\ncooperation entities contribute to the implementation \r\nand improvement of national policies and work with \r\nState institutions on humanitarian fronts. In such work, \r\nit is important to ensure that there is always synergy, \r\nconsistency with national plans and coordination with \r\nthe activities of national and local authorities on the \r\nground. \r\n In conclusion, I reiterate Colombia’s position that \r\nit is important to strengthen strategies that facilitate the \r\ntransition from emergency assistance to development. \r\nAt every stage of the process, humanitarian \r\nassistance — in the sense of emergency aid — must be \r\nconsidered temporary and must place priority on \r\nmeasures that go beyond relief and lead to lasting \r\nsolutions. That objective can be attained only with \r\nsupport by the system’s agencies for the creation and \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n17 07-60509 \r\n \r\nstrengthening of local capacities, which in turn must be \r\nbased on full respect by all for the norms, programmes \r\nand needs of the beneficiary State. \r\n Mr. Olhaye (Djibouti): At the outset, we wish to \r\nexpress our sincere sympathy to the people of \r\nBangladesh, who are struggling to cope with one of the \r\nworst cyclones in a decade. Already, more than 2,000 \r\npeople are dead, but the true scale of disaster is such \r\nthat it is feared that thousands more may have \r\nperished. In the midst of this calamity, we should not \r\nlose sight of the effectiveness of the Government’s \r\nearly warning system, which enabled a vast number of \r\npeople — more than a million coastal dwellers, at the \r\nleast — to flee to shelter. The Government’s response \r\nsystem was also extremely effective and immediate. \r\nWe have a lot to learn from Bangladesh. \r\n I wish to express the gratitude of my delegation \r\nto the Secretary-General for his reports for this \r\nmeeting. Equally, we wish to express our appreciation \r\nto Ambassador John Holmes for his assertiveness, his \r\npassionate commitment and his enlightened leadership \r\nin guiding the work of the Office for the Coordination \r\nof Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Whatever the reason, \r\nwhatever the cause, natural disasters are on the rise, \r\nand the direct consequence of that has been an \r\nexposure to greater levels of loss of life and property \r\nand material damage. Unfortunately, our world has not \r\nbeen short of armed conflicts, particularly in Africa, \r\nwhich continue to force the displacement of millions of \r\npeople into suffering and insecurity. Quite often, they \r\nare denied access to humanitarian aid. In all of these \r\ncases, OCHA is at the forefront of efforts to galvanize \r\nacutely needed assistance and to plan coordination and \r\nstrategy during complex emergencies. \r\n Growing numbers of people around the world are \r\nincreasingly exposed and vulnerable, both to natural \r\ndisasters and to complex emergencies. None of these \r\nadversities confine their destructive qualities to single \r\ncountries or regions. As the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral notes, \r\n  “The spread of humanitarian emergencies \r\nacross international borders is a common \r\nphenomenon, prompting humanitarian \r\nconsequences on a regional scale ... . \r\n  “Natural disasters often affect multiple \r\ncountries simultaneously ... . \r\n  “These are telling examples of how the \r\nspillover effects of individual conflicts and \r\ndisasters deepen humanitarian problems and \r\nfurther complicate the delivery of assistance.” \r\n(A/62/87, paras. 18, 19 and 20) \r\nThese developments strengthen the realization that we \r\nall inhabit this earth together; while today’s catastrophe \r\nmay not affect you, there is no guarantee what \r\ntomorrow’s will bring. \r\n My country’s economic and social development \r\nefforts have been constrained by insufficient water \r\nsupply; extreme climatic conditions, particularly \r\nendemic aridity; severe droughts; and occasional flash \r\nfloods. Djibouti is deeply concerned over these \r\ndevelopments and wonders if they are the initial \r\nopening events of the predicted global warming effects \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa. As the United Nations \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned, \r\nthe most pronounced consequences of the worsening \r\nglobal climate change will be felt in Africa. Already, \r\nwe in Africa are witnessing spreading shortages in \r\nrainfall, droughts, expansion of deserts with their \r\nconsequent population dislocations and food shortages. \r\nOn the other hand, when rainy seasons do arrive, \r\nalthough they are shorter, we can expect severe \r\nflooding and damage to infrastructure. \r\n What we can gather from all this is the need for \r\neach of us, within our respective capabilities, to \r\ndevelop and expand our ability to deal with risk and \r\nadversity. Disaster preparedness, or lack thereof, makes \r\nthe difference in the final analysis. However, as the \r\nSecretary-General indicates in his report, only a small \r\nfive per cent of global humanitarian funding is \r\nallocated for disaster relief. Much more needs to be \r\ndone to provide additional preparedness funding to the \r\npooled funds and humanitarian funding mechanisms, \r\nincluding consolidated and flash appeals and \r\nemergency funds of various agencies and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. \r\n The final topic I wish to mention is the \r\nestablishment of the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund (CERF). This has been a great step in the right \r\ndirection to ensure the provision of timely and reliable \r\nhumanitarian assistance to victims of natural disasters \r\nand armed conflicts. Djibouti is proud to contribute, \r\nhowever symbolically, to the CERF. We feel we have a \r\nduty to share, however small it may be, in the \r\nmitigation of global disasters that impact on our lives. \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 18 \r\n \r\n Mrs. Park Enna (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, Sir, let me express the deep condolences of the \r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Korea to the \r\nGovernment and people of Bangladesh on the huge \r\ndisaster that cyclone Sidr has caused. We sincerely \r\nhope for early recovery through an enhanced \r\nhumanitarian response on the part of the international \r\ncommunity, in close coordination with the Bangladeshi \r\nGovernment. \r\n Looking back on the past year, we have had both \r\ngood news and bad news in the field of humanitarian \r\nassistance. The good news is that progress has been \r\nmade on key initiatives, as duly noted in the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General report in document A/62/87. \r\nFirst of all, the establishment of the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund (CERF) has been very successful, and \r\nsystem-wide coherence is being discussed throughout \r\nthe United Nations Organization. Furthermore, many \r\ninitiatives have been tested and have proven their \r\nvalidity, including the cluster approach and the \r\nhumanitarian coordinator system. Partnerships for \r\nhumanitarian assistance are also growing, and the \r\nSecretary-General’s report noted that there is an \r\nongoing dialogue to improve civil-military \r\ncoordination. \r\n As one effort to strengthen partnerships in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region, the Republic of Korea hosted the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\n(OCHA) Donor Support Group (ODSG) Partnership \r\nMeeting, which was held in Seoul on 12 and 13 June. \r\nThe meeting was an opportunity for OCHA donor \r\ncountries and the countries of the Asia-Pacific region \r\nto pool their wisdom and explore ways to enhance \r\ncooperation in the field of humanitarian assistance. \r\n Unfortunately, we also face enormous challenges. \r\nSignificant trends that may impede humanitarian \r\nassistance include rising urbanization, climate change, \r\nincreasingly severe natural disasters and the growing \r\nthreat of pandemics. \r\n Bearing in mind these challenges, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the report of the Secretary-General \r\nconcerning system-wide coherence in the areas of \r\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance and the \r\nenvironment (A/61/836). We believe that it provides a \r\nsound basis for moving forward with reforms, and we \r\nencourage that practices aimed at strengthening \r\nsystem-wide coherence be put into effect as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n In this process, the Secretary-General’s role is \r\ncrucial. He should continue to show initiative and \r\nstrong leadership as he spearheads the reform process. \r\nWe also believe that the international humanitarian \r\nsystem must adapt to climate change. The recent \r\ndiscussions of the high-level meeting on climate \r\nchange should, therefore, be incorporated into our \r\nsystem-wide coherence response. \r\n The Republic of Korea also strongly promotes \r\ngender mainstreaming in every humanitarian response \r\nand throughout inter-agency coordination. Women and \r\nchildren are more vulnerable in emergency situations; \r\nindeed, they account for the majority of victims in such \r\ncircumstances. In particular, we are gravely concerned \r\nabout the serious situation of sexual violence \r\ndeliberately directed against women in many \r\nemergency situations. In this regard, we believe that \r\nthe Emergency Relief Coordinator, relevant United \r\nNations entities and Member States should strengthen \r\ntheir efforts to address the issue of sexual violence in \r\ntheir humanitarian activities. \r\n As we all know, we can never have enough funds \r\nto satisfy every demand for humanitarian relief. \r\nConsidering the practical limitations, my delegation \r\nbelieves that it is vital to distribute funding and \r\nassistance based on assessed needs. This approach is \r\npossible only if needs assessments are provided. Such \r\nassessments can help to ensure that assistance is \r\neffectively tailored to specific regions or States. For \r\nexample, the ODSG Partnership Meeting in Seoul \r\nnoted that in the Asia-Pacific region, natural disasters \r\nhave a far greater impact than armed conflict, as shown \r\nby frequent flooding in Asia, including in the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Indonesia, \r\nViet Nam and the Philippines this past summer, and \r\nmost recently in Bangladesh. Indeed, our region has \r\naccounted for 73 per cent of worldwide deaths due to \r\nnatural disasters since 2000. That is why we need to \r\npay more attention to risk reduction and preparedness. \r\n Factors such as these should be carefully \r\nconsidered when decisions are made about the kinds of \r\naid and assistance to provide. We believe that the \r\nUnited Nations should enhance its support of risk \r\nreduction and preparedness initiatives at the regional \r\nand country levels. \r\n Another factor to take into account is \r\nhumanitarian access. As the Secretary-General rightly \r\npointed out, humanitarian access to populations in need \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n19 07-60509 \r\n \r\nis a prerequisite for all humanitarian efforts. It is each \r\nGovernment’s task to secure access to the field of \r\nemergency in its country. It is regrettable that some \r\ncountries are intent on discouraging humanitarian \r\nactors from gaining access to regions in need. \r\n In an effort to provide prompt, systematic and \r\ncoordinated emergency relief abroad, the Republic of \r\nKorea enacted an International Emergency Relief Act \r\nin March 2007. \r\n I will conclude by expressing my country’s belief \r\nthat the internationally agreed development goals and a \r\nhuman rights approach should be guiding beacons in \r\nour efforts to provide humanitarian assistance. The \r\nRepublic of Korea takes this opportunity to reaffirm its \r\npledge to work towards increased cooperation in \r\nimproving and strengthening the United Nations \r\nsystem of humanitarian relief and assistance. \r\n Mr. Shinyo (Japan): At the outset, we express our \r\nheartfelt condolences to the people of Bangladesh for \r\nthe huge loss of life and the severe damage caused by \r\nthe recent cyclone disaster. We feel compassion and are \r\nready to work for the relief of the people in \r\nBangladesh, together with the international community.  \r\n Japan welcomes the ongoing efforts to advance \r\nhumanitarian reform, which will make for a more \r\neffective provision of humanitarian assistance and \r\nprotection for those in need. We commend Under-\r\nSecretary-General Holmes and the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for the \r\nwork they have done, together with other humanitarian \r\npartners, to strengthen the coordination of United \r\nNations humanitarian and disaster relief assistance. \r\n Every humanitarian organization must learn \r\nlessons from what has happened in the past and \r\nbecome even more expert at responding quickly to \r\nhumanitarian emergencies. For that, leadership is \r\nneeded on the part of the Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator who, we hope, will continue to work \r\nvigorously to meet the challenge. For its part, Japan \r\nwill continue to do its utmost to promote humanitarian \r\nreform. \r\n We wish to underline three points today. First, \r\nwith regard to humanitarian reform, it hardly needs to \r\nbe said that the United Nations family is one of the \r\nlargest bureaucracies in the world. Every bureaucracy, \r\nincluding the United Nations, has problems: rigidity, \r\nfor example, or sectionalism, or being slow to spring \r\ninto action when called upon. The humanitarian \r\ncommunity of the United Nations has initiated an effort \r\nto address those issues, however, and we appreciate \r\nthat. \r\n We support the developments that are taking \r\nplace, including the establishment of the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund and the introduction of the \r\ncluster approach and humanitarian coordinators. These \r\nconstitute a useful attempt to strengthen the \r\nOrganization’s humanitarian structure. There remains \r\nmuch to be done, but we hope the end result of \r\nstrengthening leadership in the field will be that \r\nwhenever the United Nations acts to provide \r\nhumanitarian assistance, that assistance will be \r\ncoordinated and coherent. \r\n The reform process must be broader than that, \r\nhowever. We are facing a variety of challenges, for \r\nexample, with regard to internally displaced persons, \r\nthe response to “forgotten” crises, the safety and \r\nsecurity of humanitarian personnel, the improvement \r\nof needs assessments and ensuring humanitarian \r\naccess. Those are challenges facing the entire \r\ninternational community, and all Member States must \r\ntherefore address them. \r\n We wish to emphasize the value added to \r\nhumanitarian reform by the report of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit entitled “Towards a United Nations \r\nhumanitarian assistance programme for disaster \r\nresponse and reduction: lessons learned from the \r\nIndian Ocean tsunami disaster” (A/61/699). It contains \r\nuseful recommendations, and we would like to request \r\nthe United Nations to adopt those that the Secretariat \r\ncan manage to implement internally. \r\n Secondly, we would like to underline the need to \r\nincrease our investment in the transition from relief to \r\ndevelopment, as proposed in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General’s High-level Panel on United \r\nNations System-wide Coherence. Japan agrees that we \r\nmust work to achieve a seamless transition, and it \r\nrecognizes that one important purpose of the informal \r\nconsultations on system-wide coherence is to address \r\nthat transition issue. I would add that the United \r\nNations Trust Fund for Human Security, which OCHA \r\nmanages, is a useful financial resource for effecting \r\nsuch a transition, and we would like to consult with \r\nothers on how best to use the Fund to that end. \r\n The challenge of transition also relates to \r\npeacebuilding in post-conflict countries. Peacebuilding \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 20 \r\n \r\ncovers a variety of issues, including humanitarian \r\nassistance, the peace process, security, reconstruction \r\nassistance and nation-building, and the Government of \r\nJapan, in its Official Development Assistance Charter, \r\nhas declared it of vital importance. As chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, we would like to make the \r\nmaximal contribution to that body so as to produce a \r\nconcrete and useful outcome as soon as possible by \r\ndeepening the strategic discussion in the Commission \r\nand strengthening coordination with other entities, \r\nincluding the World Bank. \r\n Thirdly, we would like to mention again this year \r\nthe urgency of disaster reduction. The consequences of \r\nhazards can be substantially mitigated by taking \r\nappropriate disaster reduction measures. By building a \r\nsociety that can survive a major disaster, we can reduce \r\nthe risk and also the magnitude of its consequences. \r\nWe need to exert as much effort for risk reduction as \r\nwe are currently exerting in providing a humanitarian \r\nresponse to disasters, and we need to do it \r\ncomprehensively, by improving prevention, \r\npreparedness, enhancing response capacity and \r\nstrengthening capacity-building in parallel. \r\nHumanitarian personnel, too, must address risk \r\nreduction as a part of the provision of assistance. \r\n The Government of Japan is of the view that risk \r\nreduction is a priority in promoting human security and \r\na vital pillar of sustainable development, and that it \r\nalso has a critical bearing on how the world adapts to \r\nclimate change.  \r\n As a nation with extensive knowledge and \r\ntechnology relating to disaster reduction, Japan has \r\nbeen actively involved in international cooperation in \r\nthat area and wishes to continue that involvement. At \r\nthe Asian-African Summit in 2005, for example, Japan \r\nannounced that it would provide more than $2.5 billion \r\nover five years in assistance for disaster prevention, \r\nmitigation and reduction measures in Asia, Africa and \r\nother regions. \r\n The target the international community must \r\nstrive to achieve is clearly described in the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action adopted at the World \r\nConference on Disaster Reduction, held in Kobe in \r\nJanuary 2005, and we need to work towards it steadily \r\nand effectively. \r\n From that viewpoint, we welcome the \r\nestablishment of the Global Facility for Disaster \r\nReduction and Recovery of the World Bank, and the \r\nfirst meeting of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction, held in June. We also welcome the \r\ndevelopment of such regional initiatives as the Tsunami \r\nWarning System, coordinated by the Intergovernmental \r\nOceanographic Commission of UNESCO. \r\n We commend humanitarian personnel for \r\ncarrying out their difficult responsibilities, often under \r\nsevere crisis conditions. And we condemn the \r\nintimidation and killing of those who are fighting so \r\nvaliantly for the well-being of others. We must do \r\neverything we can to ensure their safety. Most of all, \r\nwe need to advance humanitarian reform, standing on \r\nthe side of the people who are affected, including \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, as they so \r\ndesperately need our assistance. I assure the Assembly \r\nthat Japan will do its part. \r\n Mrs. Bhandari (Nepal): On behalf of the \r\ndelegation of Nepal, I wish to express our appreciation \r\nfor the reports of the Secretary-General submitted in \r\nconnection with agenda item 71. \r\n The world regularly faces challenges such as \r\ndisasters, refugees, conflicts and other humanitarian \r\ncrises. Recently, we have seen the devastating cyclone \r\nin Bangladesh. On behalf of the people of Nepal, I \r\nwish to express our sympathies to the Government of \r\nBangladesh and to the victims of the cyclone. We hope \r\nthat the international community will provide the \r\nassistance requested in response to this disaster. We \r\nbelieve that the United Nations has an important role to \r\nplay in coordinating humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance in these situations. \r\n The lessons from past disasters tell us that the \r\nhumanitarian response would benefit from a more \r\nsystematic approach. In particular, the United Nations \r\nsystem can play a more proactive role in risk analysis, \r\nearly warning and the coordination of response to \r\nhumanitarian and disaster situations. We believe there \r\nis a need for a more sustained mechanism to secure \r\nresources for disaster and humanitarian response \r\nincluding through the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund launched last year. \r\n Humanitarian and disaster relief assistance faces \r\nmany challenges including problems of access, \r\ncoordination, safety and security of personnel, and the \r\nlack of adequate resources. Humanitarian personnel \r\noften face various threats to their safety and security, \r\nsometimes of even deliberate attacks and hostage-\r\ntaking. Nepal deplores such attacks and calls for a \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n21 07-60509 \r\n \r\nstronger mechanism for protecting the safety and \r\nsecurity of humanitarian and other United Nations \r\npersonnel. \r\n Though the primary responsibility for protection \r\nof United Nations staff rests with host Governments, \r\nthe United Nations system should do all it can within \r\nits reach to enhance the safety and security of its \r\nhumanitarian and peacekeeping personnel. \r\n The Department of Safety and Security should \r\nenhance its capacity to analyse threats to the safety and \r\nsecurity of United Nations personnel and to devise a \r\nmechanism to prevent such threats. In particular, its \r\ncapacity to negotiate during crises, such as in hostage-\r\ntaking situations, needs improvement. There is a \r\ngreater need for coordination among the United \r\nNations system, Governments and non-governmental \r\nhumanitarian agencies for handling the humanitarian \r\naspects of disasters, refugees and internally displaced \r\npersons resulting from conflicts. \r\n As a country prone to disasters such as \r\nearthquakes, floods and landslides, Nepal attaches \r\ngreat significance to the work of the United Nations in \r\nthe area of humanitarian and disaster response. The \r\nGovernment of Nepal has given high priority to \r\ndisaster prevention, mitigation, relief and rehabilitation \r\nand has integrated these concepts into development \r\nplanning. However, we need more sustained support \r\nfor strengthening our national capability in disaster and \r\nhumanitarian response. \r\n Nepal is committed to providing relief and \r\nrehabilitation to the victims of the decade-long conflict \r\nin accordance with the Comprehensive Peace Accord \r\nsigned in November 2006 between the Government of \r\nNepal and the Maoist Communist Party of Nepal. \r\nPursuant to this agreement, the Ministry of Peace and \r\nReconstruction is working in coordination with \r\nrelevant actors for the safe return of internally \r\ndisplaced persons to their homes and for returning land \r\nand property. Nepal would highly appreciate greater \r\ninternational assistance for efforts towards the relief \r\nand rehabilitation of the victims of the conflict and for \r\nthe reconstruction of its infrastructure destroyed during \r\nthe conflict. \r\n We hope that the current dialogue among the \r\npolitical parties will lead to an early finalization of the \r\ndates for elections for the Constituent Assembly. With \r\nthese and other developments in the peace process, we \r\nare confident that the humanitarian plight of the people \r\nof Nepal affected by the conflict of the past will be \r\nhealed in the days to come. \r\n In conclusion, Nepal is committed to work with \r\nother Member States to strengthen the coordination of \r\nUnited Nations humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance all over the world. \r\n Mr. Tarragô (Brazil): My delegation joins other \r\ndelegations in conveying the condolences and \r\nsolidarity of Brazil to the people and Government of \r\nBangladesh with respect to the calamity that has \r\nbefallen that country. \r\n Brazil has increased its efforts to provide \r\nhumanitarian assistance to areas and populations \r\naffected by natural disasters and complex emergencies. \r\nThose actions are taken in the context of our solidarity \r\nand commitment to the promotion and realization of \r\nhuman rights and development for all. They also \r\nrepresent for Brazilian society an opportunity for joint \r\naction in humanitarian affairs in a form of participation \r\nthat is a requisite for the full realization of democracy. \r\n The assistance provided to victims of the Indian \r\nOcean tsunami in 2005 and the repatriation of \r\nBrazilian nationals from Lebanon as a result of the \r\nconflict in 2006 are recent examples that signal a new \r\nphase in Brazil’s involvement in international \r\nhumanitarian assistance, both in terms of the volume of \r\nthe assistance delivered and in reaching far-flung areas. \r\n Naturally, our assistance has been felt in \r\nneighbouring countries in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. In the past two years, Brazil has contributed \r\nresources or sent medicines, food and specialized \r\npersonnel to eleven countries in the region. \r\n My country has also granted refuge to an \r\nunprecedented number of people from Palestine. In \r\n2007, it resettled in its territory more than 100 \r\nPalestinian refugees affected by the crisis in Iraq. We \r\nhave done so in cooperation with the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and \r\nlocal non-governmental organizations (NGOs). \r\n In order to make Brazilian humanitarian officials \r\nbetter acquainted with the United Nations system and \r\npractices, Brazil hosted in March 2007 a seminar on \r\ninternational humanitarian assistance, with the \r\npresence of the Assistant Secretary-General for \r\nHumanitarian Affairs, the Deputy Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator and the President of the White Helmets \r\nInitiative from Argentina, who exchanged valuable \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 22 \r\n \r\ninformation with our civil defence and federal and \r\nregional authorities. \r\n We have taken note of the Secretary-General’s \r\nconclusion that the requests for humanitarian \r\nassistance are likely to increase, which will require \r\nadditional efforts from member States and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. We concur with the \r\nSecretary-General’s view on the need for a multilateral, \r\ncomprehensive and urgent response to address climate \r\nchange, which has a direct bearing on many of the \r\nemergencies we have faced and will still have to face \r\nin the future. \r\n We deem especially important the engagement of \r\nactors at all levels in the response to emergencies. We \r\nmust therefore strengthen local, national and regional \r\ncapacities so as to ensure a timely and adequate \r\ndeployment of resources. \r\n No less important than the engagement of \r\nrelevant actors is coordination on the ground. We \r\nlearned with interest of the results achieved so far by \r\nthe cluster working groups. We look forward to a \r\ncomprehensive evaluation of the merits of applying the \r\ncluster approach at the field level. \r\n Despite the unexpected nature of many \r\nemergency situations, a preventive approach is possible \r\nand is ever more important. We support initiatives \r\nfocused on risk reduction and preparedness, especially \r\nin vulnerable areas and communities. The unmatched \r\nexperience of the United Nations in emergency \r\nsituations must be fully shared so as to enhance local \r\nand national capacities. On the other hand, best \r\npractices at the local level must be incorporated into \r\nthe expertise of the United Nations. \r\n From our own experience in our territory, we \r\nhave realized the crucial role played by community-\r\nbased organizations and civil society, including NGOs, \r\nin rescue, rapid response and recovery. Their \r\nparticipation in the coordination efforts with \r\nGovernmental agencies will greatly contribute to the \r\neffectiveness of the response system as a whole. For \r\nexample, a Latin American and Caribbean network of \r\npsychological assistance in cases of emergencies and \r\ndisasters was recently created by civil society with \r\nGovernmental support. \r\n The Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF) has \r\nproved to be an important tool in responding to \r\nemergency situations. We are glad that the Fund is well \r\non its way to reaching the goal of $500 million in \r\nresources. Brazil contributed to the Fund this year and \r\nexpects to make a higher pledge at the high-level \r\nconference in December. We look forward to the \r\nresults of the independent review of the Fund in 2008. \r\n We wish to highlight the importance of \r\nunhindered access of humanitarian personnel to \r\naffected areas. We deplore the fact that, particularly in \r\nsituations of armed conflict, this access is sometimes \r\ndeliberately denied. Such denial is a violation of \r\ninternational humanitarian law, and, in many cases, \r\nimplies violations to the international human rights law \r\nand refugee law. The State is responsible to protect its \r\nown population and this responsibility includes, in our \r\nview, ensuring access of humanitarian personnel to the \r\naffected people. \r\n We remain concerned with the continued risks \r\nfaced by humanitarian personnel around the globe, \r\nparticularly in complex emergencies. We regret to learn \r\nfrom the September 2007 report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the safety and security of humanitarian \r\npersonnel and protection of United Nations personnel \r\n(A/62/324) that some 4,000 incidents had taken place \r\nin the previous 12 months. Arrangements and policies \r\nmust be adopted in order to provide both United \r\nNations and locally recruited staff with adequate safety \r\nand security. Furthermore, crimes against humanitarian \r\npersonnel can not remain unpunished: those \r\nresponsible must be brought to justice. \r\n One aspect that deserves our best attention is the \r\ntransition from relief to development. In this regard, \r\nwe believe that the Hyogo Declaration and the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action should be fully implemented, in \r\nparticular the commitments to assist developing \r\ncountries, especially the more vulnerable and the \r\ndisaster-stricken countries, towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment. States should be encouraged to \r\nstrengthen their capacities, enact appropriate laws and \r\npursue sustained, nationally-owned strategies to enable \r\nthem to cope with the effects of disasters. In this \r\nendeavour, cooperation between States, the United \r\nNations system and other relevant organizations is very \r\nimportant. \r\n We would like to once more draw attention to the \r\nneed for a revised and more comprehensive approach \r\nto humanitarian issues, one that goes beyond the \r\ndichotomy of providers and beneficiaries, donors and \r\nrecipients, and financial aspects. \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n23 07-60509 \r\n \r\n In many cases, developing countries, particularly \r\nthose in the neighbourhood of conflict-stricken areas, \r\nprovide substantial contribution, as they usually absorb \r\nmassive refugee flows and bear the high economic and \r\nsocial costs of regional humanitarian emergencies. \r\nDeveloping countries should therefore be assured \r\nbroader participation in decision-making and policy \r\nsupervision of humanitarian affairs. Brazil remains \r\ncommitted to working towards that end. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): Allow me to congratulate \r\nthe President on his able stewardship of the General \r\nAssembly. In the interest of time and brevity, I intend \r\nto condense the agenda items applicable to my \r\ndelegation into one statement. \r\n At the outset, my delegation wishes to extend its \r\nheartfelt sympathies to Bangladesh, which was recently \r\nhit by a disastrous cyclone. We offer condolences to \r\nthe Government of Bangladesh and to the countless \r\nfamilies who have lost loved ones, and we hope the \r\nhumanitarian efforts to mitigate this severe natural \r\ndisaster will continue to provide support and aid to the \r\nmillions obliged to flee their homes and left devastated \r\nand destitute. \r\n Coordination of emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance is a matter of grave importance for the \r\nUnited Nations. Israel, over time, has developed well-\r\nknown and specific expertise in rapid response \r\nassistance and disaster management and views it as a \r\nresponsibility to share these practices with the \r\ninternational community. When disasters strike — be \r\nthey earthquakes, tsunamis or political conflicts — the \r\nfirst few days are often the most critical for life-saving \r\nactivities. Hence, in the past, Israel has deployed rapid \r\nresponse, emergency search and rescue and medical \r\nteams to natural disasters in our region and around the \r\nworld. To mention just a few cases in recent years, \r\nthese include disasters in Armenia, India, Indonesia, \r\nKenya, Sri Lanka and Turkey. \r\n Regarding the statement delivered earlier today \r\n(see A/62/PV.53) by the Palestinian representative in \r\nconnection with the report of the Secretary-General on \r\nassistance to the Palestinian people (A/62/82), it is \r\nregrettable that he once again focused on rhetoric and \r\npolitics rather than on reality and meaningful solutions \r\nto the matters at hand. Surely, there are numerous \r\ncomplexities involved in considering the situation in \r\nour region, taking into account Israeli security and \r\nPalestinian stability. The internal violence among the \r\nPalestinians that we have witnessed lately has \r\nsquandered too many opportunities for progress. The \r\nsame applies to the continuation of daily Palestinian \r\nterrorism, among other factors. No one can detach \r\nhimself or herself from this very stark reality, although, \r\namazingly enough, the statement we heard earlier \r\ntoday did. \r\n As many in this Hall are aware, due to the \r\nimportant choices made by the Palestinian leadership, \r\nthere is a Government today that meets the standards of \r\nthe international community. Hence, if we look at the \r\nreality on the ground, there are a number of initiatives \r\nand projects aimed specifically at providing assistance \r\nto the Palestinian people. But the statement made today \r\nby the Palestinian representative seems to ignore these \r\nimportant developments. \r\n Consider the astronomical difference between my \r\nPalestinian colleague’s politicized narrative and the \r\nreality on the ground. One reality on the ground is a \r\nsewage project, under the direction of the World Bank, \r\nunder way in Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip to alleviate a \r\nstrain on the current cesspools near the village. Israel is \r\nworking to expedite the building of the plant by \r\ntracking down non-metal pipes to be used in the \r\nfacility. \r\n Another reality on the ground is that, as of today, \r\nmore than 230 Palestinian trainees in fields such as \r\npublic health, small business, agriculture, educational \r\nplanning and empowerment of women and youth are \r\nenrolled in projects and seminars sponsored by Israel \r\nthrough its Centre for International Cooperation \r\n(MASHAV). Hundreds of others have participated in \r\nsimilar programmes over the past 15 years. \r\n Another reality on the ground is Israeli and \r\nPalestinian business leaders holding meetings, such as \r\nthose between the Israeli Manufacturers Association \r\nhigh-level forum and its Palestinian counterparts, and \r\nthe Portland Fund’s initiation of an Israeli-Palestinian \r\nChamber of Commerce. Yet another reality on the \r\nground is that Israel has released, contrary to what we \r\nhave heard today, approximately $250 million in tax \r\nand customs revenues, with the remaining sum, nearly \r\n$250 million more, to be transferred by the end of the \r\nyear, in accordance with Palestinian wishes and \r\ninstructions. \r\n These are merely a few examples of practical \r\nsteps being taken to assist the Palestinian Government \r\nand to create a better environment for progress. Israel \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 24 \r\n \r\nbelieves that this Palestinian Government provides a \r\nnew opportunity to move forward in the peace process \r\nand realize the two-State vision, which is why it has \r\neased movement and removed checkpoints in the West \r\nBank, allowed Palestinian security forces deployment \r\nand consented to the transfer of supplies and \r\nequipment to those forces. \r\n But no assistance will ever come at the expense \r\nof Israeli security or permit actions which would \r\nendanger the lives of our citizens. May I remind the \r\nAssembly that, while just yesterday Israel considered \r\nthe release of 441 Palestinian prisoners as a gesture of \r\ngoodwill, a barrage of more than 20 mortars was fired \r\ninto Israel from the Gaza Strip. \r\n The Palestinians must realize that Israeli security \r\nand safety are in their own national interest. As long as \r\nthe rockets continue to fall on the people of Sderot and \r\nother Israeli cities, the crossings cannot operate \r\nproperly. Terrorism is to blame for restrictions on the \r\ncrossings and on access. Hence, taking responsibility \r\nfor its security is the first and foremost step for \r\nPalestinians in order to see the promise of a new \r\ntomorrow. \r\n With regard to draft resolution A/62/L.12, entitled \r\n“Strengthening of international cooperation and \r\ncoordination of efforts to study, mitigate and minimize \r\nthe consequences of the Chernobyl disaster”, Israel is \r\npleased to be a sponsor and to join in the consensus, \r\nand we affirm the importance of wide and active \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination in \r\nmitigating the consequences of such accidents for the \r\nlives and health of all people. \r\n Nevertheless, my delegation wishes to put on \r\nrecord, for the purpose of consideration at a later date, \r\na matter of related concern. It is our hope that in the \r\nfuture draft resolutions on this item will deal not only \r\nwith those affected in the countries and geographical \r\nareas, but also with all populations who once lived in \r\nthe area of a catastrophe and were adversely impacted \r\nby such a disaster. Whether or not individuals have \r\nchosen to remain in the original area of a catastrophe is \r\nlargely irrelevant to the fact that they continue to suffer \r\nand to bear the consequences of the disaster. In the \r\nspecific case of Chernobyl, many individuals and \r\nfamilies migrated to other countries. For instance, \r\nIsrael has absorbed approximately 100,000 migrants \r\nfrom the Chernobyl area over the years. Hence, they \r\ntoo should be entitled to the same access to information \r\nand be included in research, studies and materials \r\npublished on the health, environmental and socio-\r\neconomic consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, \r\nespecially those commissioned by United Nations \r\nentities. \r\n Since draft resolutions on this item will be \r\nconsidered on a triennial basis beginning next session, \r\nmy delegation has sought the opportunity to place our \r\nconcerns on record in the hope that they will be raised \r\nfor discussion during the next negotiations. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express our admiration for the \r\nexcellent manner in which Mr. Kerim has been guiding \r\nthe work of the General Assembly. \r\n I would also like to express our feelings of \r\nsympathy and solidarity with the Government and the \r\npeople of Bangladesh with regard to the recent natural \r\ndisaster there. We would ask the delegation of \r\nBangladesh to convey to the Government and the \r\npeople of that country our deep sympathy and \r\ncondolences. \r\n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor the exhaustive report contained in document \r\nA/62/87, on the “Strengthening of the coordination of \r\nemergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations.” We also wish to hail the efforts made by the \r\nrelevant agencies and organizations active in the \r\nhumanitarian sphere, such as the International \r\nOrganization for Migration, the International Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Movement and the \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) — which \r\ndeserve special mention — that are supported by \r\nnational organizations, civil society sectors and \r\nassociations that work to accelerate the access of those \r\naffected by crises to assistance. \r\n In order to meet the global challenges of today, \r\nincluding humanitarian issues, we need broader \r\nunderstanding to strengthen cooperation and \r\ncoordination with national institutions. The world is \r\nnow seeing an increase in natural disasters and \r\nman-made ones. Some of the disasters recur under \r\nconditions where joint coordination and early warning \r\nmechanisms are required and those recurrent \r\ncatastrophes have led to what we call the globalization \r\nof human disasters that cross national borders and thus \r\nmultiply their dire effects. \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n25 07-60509 \r\n \r\n In that regard, the Government of the Sudan \r\nwould like to reaffirm the importance of complying \r\nwith the guidelines for humanitarian assistance, \r\nincluding, neutrality, independence, transparency, \r\nintegrity and respect for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of a country. \r\n The role of the States at the regional level is \r\nessential in complementing the efforts of the United \r\nNations through the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs. The regional role of States is \r\nexemplified by the experience of the Sudan in this \r\nregard. The Sudan has hosted the largest organization \r\nfor emergency assistance in the world, Sudan Lifeline, \r\nto coordinate humanitarian assistance with the help of \r\nthe national Government. On the basis of that \r\nexperience and in addition to United Nations assistance \r\nin Darfur, the Sudan signed a humanitarian protocol in \r\nMarch 2007 with United Nations Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs, John Holmes. That \r\nhad a positive effect and facilitated the accelerated \r\nprovision of humanitarian assistance to Darfur through \r\nthe fast-track system. \r\n The Sudanese Government has created a high-\r\nlevel committee to follow-up on the implementation of \r\nthat protocol. The committee includes representatives \r\nof the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as \r\nwell as representatives of donor countries to follow-up \r\non the implementation of the protocol. The effects of \r\nthe stabilization of humanitarian assistance — as is \r\nclear in the reports of the Secretary-General on the \r\nprovision of humanitarian assistance — are reflected in \r\nthe stabilization of malnutrition statistics, the reduction \r\nof mortality rates and the stabilization of public health \r\nrates, with the result that there are no epidemic \r\ndiseases in the region at the current time. \r\n That could not have taken place without \r\ncooperation and coordination between the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies and the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and its important national \r\norganizations. At a time when we affirm the \r\nimportance of humanitarian assistance for man-made \r\ndisasters, the United Nations must, by the same token, \r\ngive greater attention to peaceful sustainable solutions. \r\n While we commend the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/62/87) on humanitarian conditions in \r\nDarfur, we wish to comment on certain parts of the \r\nreport, especially paragraph 15. Regions where \r\nhumanitarian access has been stagnant because of the \r\nlack of security are the areas where rebel movements \r\nare in control. Those are the only areas that witness \r\nattacks on humanitarian workers. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reports to the Security Council have \r\nindicated that the rebel movements are the ones that \r\ncarried out those attacks. \r\n My delegation wishes to express its greatest \r\nappreciation and gratitude to all of those who have \r\ntaken part in humanitarian assistance to Darfur. \r\n The experience of the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund, as indicated in the report, has \r\ndemonstrated the importance of providing assistance in \r\nareas beyond traditional channels, by giving immediate \r\nassistance to meet the appeals made to answer the \r\nchallenges in areas that need to be stabilized. That \r\nunderscores the need for joint action and development \r\nassistance, which, through rapid and small response \r\nprojects would encourage return from camps to the \r\noriginal regions. It also emphasizes the importance of \r\ncomplementarity in humanitarian assistance and the \r\nneed for development in order not to rely on assistance \r\nalone, but also to provide a smooth transition from \r\nassistance to development and rebuilding. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General highlighted \r\nin its recommendations the importance of \r\nstrengthening cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional and non-governmental organizations. \r\nWhile we reaffirm the importance of non-governmental \r\norganizations in the humanitarian sphere, we should \r\nsay that some NGOs are using humanitarian assistance \r\nas a front to carry out objectives other than \r\nhumanitarian assistance. \r\n Very recently, we saw an attempt by a French \r\nnon-governmental organization to use a humanitarian \r\naction as a front to try to remove Sudanese and \r\nChadian children and smuggle them away from their \r\nhomes and take them abroad in the guise of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. Such alarming action on the \r\npart of some NGOs leads us to ask that all parties \r\ncomply with humanitarian guidelines in order to \r\nachieve the desired objectives. \r\n We would like to strengthen coordination of \r\nUnited Nations humanitarian assistance in order to \r\naddress recurrent and complex cases of emergency in \r\nvarious parts of the world. \r\n Ms. Rodríguez de Ortiz (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We wish first and \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 26 \r\n \r\nforemost to express the solidarity of the people and \r\nGovernment of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nwith the victims and their relatives in Bangladesh, who \r\nhave just been affected by the recent tragedy of \r\ncyclone Sidr that caused many deaths. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela attaches \r\nparticular importance to humanitarian and emergency \r\nassistance in the case of disasters at the international \r\nlevel. In that context we wish to reaffirm resolution \r\n46/182 of December 1991, which sets out the guiding \r\nprinciples of United Nations humanitarian emergency \r\nassistance. We must work towards global mobilization \r\nto create greater awareness of the true magnitude of the \r\nproblems and threats we are facing. That includes \r\nreducing the risks of disasters. We must involve all \r\nactors: not only all levels of Government, but also all \r\nrelevant international, regional and subregional \r\norganizations. We must move from words to action. \r\nVenezuela is convinced of the need to promote all \r\nactivities in our region that will enable us to reinforce \r\nthat idea. We have our conscience and the tools we \r\nneed to move forward. We have no excuse. The \r\ninternational community can count on my entire \r\ncountry as a natural ally in this struggle. \r\n At the national level, there is the commitment of \r\nthe President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nand a national civil protection and disaster \r\nmanagement organization, established by the \r\nconstitution. Since February 2005, we have mandated \r\nthat body to strengthen preventive actions before \r\ndisasters occur. Thus, we have moved from disaster \r\nmanagement to risk management in order to present a \r\nsolid, cross-cutting and multisectoral platform \r\ncomposed not only of governmental decision-making \r\nbodies, but also entities with a definite impact: private \r\ncompanies, non-governmental organizations, \r\nvolunteers and the community itself. We have \r\nestablished a national risk management commission, \r\nwhose primary objective is to reduce risks of a \r\nstructural or non-structural nature. We have also \r\nestablished the Simón Bolívar Humanitarian Task \r\nForce to strengthen disaster prevention and assistance \r\nefforts. Breaking with the assistance-based paradigm of \r\nsuch bodies, we have made it a multidisciplinary and \r\nmultisectoral unit focused on risk-reduction activities. \r\nThus, we have moved from the damage and needs \r\nassessment approach, which characterizes emergency \r\nresponse organizations, to an approach based on risk \r\nand needs assessment, which addresses specific risks \r\nof all kinds at the national level. \r\n This human team is based in five regions of our \r\ncountry, where it participates in humanitarian \r\nassistance efforts at the international level in Central \r\nAmerica, the Andean countries, the Amazon region, the \r\nCaribbean and the rest of the world. In addition, the \r\norganization has a national, state and municipal fund \r\nthat provides financial support for disaster prevention \r\nand assistance activities. For example, it has \r\nparticipated in activities in Bolivia, Cuba, Dominica, \r\nthe Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, \r\nGrenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica and \r\nSuriname, as well as in efforts to support displaced \r\nLebanese citizens evacuated during the hostilities in \r\nthat brotherly country last year. In addition, we are \r\nfavourably considering providing humanitarian \r\nassistance in response to requests by the brotherly \r\ncountries of Chile, Bangladesh and Mexico. In Bolivia, \r\nwe participated both before and after the 2006 floods in \r\npreventive actions that helped to reduce the damage \r\ncaused. \r\n The organization is also working to identify, \r\nassess and monitor disaster risks and to strengthen \r\nearly-warning systems through the national disaster \r\nprevention and assistance centre. This is the technical-\r\nscientific component of the national civil protection \r\nand disaster management organization, which enables \r\nus to monitor and process national information on \r\ndisaster risks with a view to decision-making in the \r\narea of prevention and emergency assistance. \r\n Likewise, we are making great efforts in the area \r\nof formal and non-formal education. Through \r\neducational programmes in which local communities \r\nare being trained to protect themselves, we are teaching \r\nsuch communities to organize, plan and develop risk \r\nand disaster management programmes at the local \r\nlevel. The national Government is also working to \r\nreduce underlying risk factors through educational \r\nmissions, including literacy instruction and training at \r\nthe basic, diversified and university levels, thus \r\nincorporating a large population excluded from the \r\neducational system. These programmes include \r\ncomprehensive training in civil protection aimed at risk \r\nand disaster management. Other social missions in the \r\nareas of health, nutrition, housing, energy and \r\nindigenous populations, inter alia, are firmly \r\ncommitted to reducing the high levels of poverty and \r\nmarginalization that have existed in our country and \r\n A/62/PV.54\r\n \r\n27 07-60509 \r\n \r\nthat, as in many other parts of the world, are increasing \r\nthe frequency of disasters. \r\n Moreover, we are actively participating in and \r\nsupporting the activities of relevant regional and \r\nsubregional organs, including the work of the High-\r\nlevel Conference on Disaster Reduction organized by \r\nthe Association of Caribbean States, held in Haiti last \r\nweek from 14 to 16 November. We participated in \r\norder to demonstrate our conviction that we must \r\nstrengthen our prevention, mitigation and response \r\ncapacities in order to reduce the risks of disasters and \r\nthat it is our generation’s duty to support such \r\nactivities. \r\n Another important aspect that we should \r\nhighlight is the recent visit to Venezuela by a \r\ndelegation from the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), led by Ms. Margareta \r\nWahlström, Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator for \r\nHumanitarian Affairs. The visit, which was an \r\nunqualified success, further strengthened our \r\nrelationship with that specialized agency of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Finally, the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela believes it is important to reiterate the \r\nrequest made to the Secretary-General for a detailed \r\nreport on OCHA’s disbursement of funds in support of \r\nhumanitarian assistance activities and the impact of \r\nsuch activities in countries affected by natural \r\ndisasters. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the Observer State of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): At the very \r\noutset, I wish to convey sincere condolences to the \r\npeople and the Government of Bangladesh in the wake \r\nof the terrible cyclone that left thousands dead and \r\nmillions with property and livelihoods in ruins. Our \r\nappreciation goes to all those who responded \r\nimmediately to the humanitarian emergency. \r\n The utter destruction that we have just seen in \r\nBangladesh illustrates the many devastating effects of \r\nthe natural and man-made disasters confronting \r\npeoples all over the world year after year. Men and \r\nwomen working for international, national and local \r\nhumanitarian organizations — many of which are faith-\r\nbased — risk their lives and their future to aid the \r\nvictims of such catastrophes. It is for the safety of \r\nthose humanitarian workers and for the welfare of the \r\nsuffering people whom they assist that we must work \r\nfor a truly effective, coordinated and humane disaster-\r\nresponse system. \r\n Last year, the high rate of natural disasters around \r\nthe world was, sadly, accompanied by many extremely \r\ncostly man-made ones. Armed conflicts have \r\ndevastated societies in many places, taken lives, ruined \r\neconomies, set back development and frustrated efforts \r\nto restore peace. Given the terrible consequences of \r\narmed conflict, we must once again recall that, in the \r\nunfortunate case of war, all parties involved must \r\ncomply fully with the rules and principles of \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law \r\nrelated to the protection of humanitarian personnel, \r\nsuch as allowing full and unimpeded access by \r\nhumanitarian personnel to all people in need of \r\nassistance. Likewise, those same parties are under \r\nobligation to guarantee safe and unhampered access to \r\nhumanitarian aid to civilians and all victims of armed \r\nconflict. \r\n Member States have focused increasingly on the \r\nneed to prevent and reduce risks associated with \r\ndisasters. The adoption of the Hyogo Framework for \r\nAction 2005-2015 demonstrated the commitment by \r\ncountries to place preparedness and prevention on a par \r\nwith response and recovery. This policy is particularly \r\nrelevant at the national and local levels. By increasing \r\nthe knowledge and capacity of local actors to respond \r\neffectively to emergency situations, countries can \r\nreduce the long-term cost and consequences of a \r\ndisaster. Local civic and faith-based organizations are \r\nhighly effective in this regard, and thus must be fully \r\nengaged, supported and, when necessary, duly \r\nprotected. \r\n The position of the United Nations within the \r\ninternational community puts it in a key position to \r\ncoordinate humanitarian response to disasters. For this \r\nresponse to be effective, the Organization needs the \r\nfull cooperation of the States directly concerned, \r\nespecially in ensuring that the latter fully comply with \r\ntheir obligations under international law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, and that they fulfil their \r\nresponsibility to protect their own people. \r\n Moreover, as humanitarian agencies grow in \r\nnumber and variety, the United Nations could enhance \r\ncollaboration among them and harness their \r\ncomplementary capacities, while respecting their \r\ndifferences and the specific aims and principles of each \r\nA/62/PV.54  \r\n \r\n07-60509 28 \r\n \r\norganization. We note with interest the work done in \r\nthis regard by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee. \r\n Long-term and sustainable post-disaster recovery \r\ncontinues to be a challenge and a necessity. While \r\nindividual Governments are responsible for developing \r\nlong-term recovery strategies, collaboration with local \r\nagencies is important, in particular with those that have \r\nacquired concrete knowledge of the situation and have \r\na long-term deployment of resources in the region. \r\nThis could cushion unintended harmful effects, \r\nespecially on the more vulnerable sectors of society, \r\ndue to the transition from emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance to the recovery phase. \r\n Finally, long-term recovery requires the \r\ncontinued interest and support of the international \r\ncommunity. An outpouring of good will and \r\ninternational solidarity most often follow live reports \r\nand images of humanitarian disasters; but as attention \r\nand resources move to other priorities, it quickly \r\nweakens or even disappears. This could be very costly, \r\nespecially in post-conflict situations in which the \r\nprobability of a relapse into violence is very high, or in \r\nplaces where a truly catastrophic natural disaster could \r\nwipe out the economic base of entire communities. \r\n A steady commitment is necessary if a \r\nsustainable and long-term recovery system of peoples \r\nand regions affected is to be achieved. We therefore \r\nwelcome initiatives to highlight often-forgotten \r\nhumanitarian situations and underfunded humanitarian \r\nefforts throughout the world. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m. \r\n"
