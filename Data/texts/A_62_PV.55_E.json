(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Abdelaziz \r\n(Egypt), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 71 and 72 (continued) \r\n \r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance: reports of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/62/324 and Corr.1) \r\n \r\n (a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/62/72, \r\nA/62/83, A/62/87 and A/62/323) \r\n \r\n (b) Special economic assistance to individual \r\ncountries or regions \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/310) \r\n \r\n (c) Assistance to the Palestinian people \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/82) \r\n \r\n (d) Strengthening of international cooperation  \r\nand coordination of efforts to study, mitigate \r\nand minimize the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/467) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.12) \r\n \r\nAssistance to survivors of the 1994 genocide in \r\nRwanda, particularly orphans, widows and victims of \r\nsexual violence \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/310) \r\n \r\n Mr. Castellón Duarte (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Allow me first to express my solidarity with \r\nthe Government and people of Bangladesh, Mexico and \r\nthe Dominican Republic for the losses they have \r\nsuffered as a result of the enormous floods, and to the \r\npeople and Government of Chile for the disaster \r\nfollowing the latest earthquakes. \r\n The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua with its ethnic \r\ndiversity and great cultural riches occupies 46 per cent \r\nof the country and is organized into two autonomous \r\nregions. Its human and natural resources, history, \r\ncultural diversity and geographic location make up the \r\nbasic elements to ensure proper living conditions for \r\nthe people and to make substantial contributions to the \r\ncountry in social, economic and political terms. \r\n However, on the morning of 4 September 2005, \r\nHurricane Felix — a category-five hurricane — hit the \r\ncountry 51 kilometres north of Bilwi in the North \r\nAtlantic Autonomous Region, revealing once again the \r\nvulnerability of the area — owing to the systematic \r\npoverty and exclusion experienced in the Caribbean \r\nregion of Nicaragua — as those principally affected by \r\nthe hurricane were indigenous peoples of Miskito, \r\nSumo-Mayangna and African descent. \r\n That recent event was a tragedy in human, \r\ncultural, environmental and economic terms. But it also \r\nA/62/PV.55  \r\n \r\n07-60524 2 \r\n \r\nprovided an opportunity to launch an organized and \r\ncoherent effort involving communal, territorial, \r\nregional, municipal and national authorities to deal \r\nwith the emergency and resume development of the \r\nregion. \r\n Based upon information collected after the \r\nhurricane, it affected more than 200,000 people. More \r\nthan 300 people died and 133 are missing. That \r\nirreparable loss of life was also accompanied by a \r\nlarge-scale ecological disaster with enormous \r\nconsequences. Among the 1.3 million hectares of land \r\naffected, 477,000 hectares of forest were devastated. \r\nThat loss should not be measured in terms of the loss \r\nof timber, but in the loss of a rich biodiversity and \r\nliving ecosystem that provided the historical and \r\ncultural meaning that the forest represented for the \r\nindigenous communities. \r\n The destruction of infrastructure is evidenced by \r\nthe destruction of 20,394 homes, 57 churches, 102 \r\nschools and 43 health care centres. 86,538 hectares of \r\ntraditional and non-traditional agricultural crops were \r\ndestroyed as well as 40,011 large and small farm \r\nanimals. 70.8 per cent of the fowl, 18.9 per cent of the \r\npigs and 10.2 per cent of the cattle were lost. Many \r\nfishing boats and much equipment were also destroyed, \r\nin particular small boats and 48,355 pieces of fishing \r\nequipment. \r\n 500 kilometres of all-weather roads were \r\naffected, including bridges and drainage pipes. It also \r\ncaused the partial destruction of the only sea port that \r\nthe area has. The damage caused by the hurricane is \r\nestimated at some $850 million. \r\n The response of friendly States and the United \r\nNations to the tragedy was immediate, including a \r\nFlash Appeal by the Central Emergency Response Fund \r\nand the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs, which provoked an immediate reaction from \r\nthe international community. In light of all of that, on \r\nbehalf of the Government and people of Nicaragua, I \r\nwish to thank all of those States from all parts of the \r\nworld who have given us aid and who continue to \r\nprovide relief while we are working to deal with the \r\ncrisis caused by the hurricane. \r\n At the same time I wish to extend our thanks to \r\nthe Secretary-General and United Nations staff, as well \r\nas to the organs and specialized agencies of the system \r\nand the non-governmental organizations that have \r\ninvolved themselves in this crisis. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, \r\nI now call on the observer for the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\n Ms. Johnson (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): I speak here today \r\non the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance, an issue of great significance to the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies (IFRC). But, before I go into my \r\nprepared remarks, let me extend the deep condolences \r\nof the International Federation, all of our members’ \r\nnational societies, Red Cross and Red Crescent, to the \r\npeople of Bangladesh, who are in these days very busy \r\nresponding to the terrible tragedy of the cyclone that \r\naffected their country last week. I wish to assure the \r\nBangladesh Government of our deep commitment to \r\ncontinue to do everything we can as the International \r\nFederation to mobilize the appropriate resources to \r\nassist the Bangladesh Red Crescent in the relief efforts, \r\nin recovery and in risk reduction efforts going forward, \r\nand of course in full coordination with the Bangladesh \r\nGovernment and United Nations agencies and other \r\nhumanitarian actors. \r\n As we have been reminded through the course of \r\nyesterday’s debate and this morning’s, natural disasters \r\nof all kinds affect peoples around the world every day. \r\nThis debate today is actually about the future of \r\nmillions of vulnerable people throughout the world. \r\n I will focus some of my comments on the way \r\nenvironmental degradation and climate change are \r\nimpacting humanitarian assistance, and on the \r\nimplications for Governments and humanitarian \r\norganizations alike. \r\n We welcome the increased attention of the \r\ninternational community to climate change and we \r\napplaud the determination of the Secretary-General and \r\nthe President of the General Assembly in bringing \r\nabout intergovernmental dialogue within the United \r\nNations system on what may be one of today’s greatest \r\nglobal challenges. It is also a challenge the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies (IFRC) will address at the thirtieth \r\ninternational conference of the Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent next week in Geneva. \r\n The Secretary-General’s speech at the launching \r\nof the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in \r\nValencia last week was a clear call to action and \r\n A/62/PV.55\r\n \r\n3 07-60524 \r\n \r\nhighlights the urgency of a consolidation of political \r\nwill. Much relevant background is in his report on \r\nhumanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, \r\nwhich confirms the dramatic increase in disasters over \r\nthe past 20 years. Statistics also point to a dramatic \r\nincrease in localized, small-scale disasters affecting \r\ncommunities of under 25,000 people. \r\n We are all well aware of the need to invest in \r\ndisaster preparedness, and many speakers in this debate \r\nhave already made that point. Let me return to the \r\nsituation in Bangladesh to illustrate it. The Bangladesh \r\nRed Crescent, supported by the International \r\nFederation, had been investing in preparedness and \r\nearly warning measures for more than 20 years before \r\nCyclone Sidr hit the country. That demonstrates what \r\ncan be done. The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society \r\nworked with national authorities to ensure that those \r\npreparedness efforts were very effective. Despite that, \r\nof course, there has been a terrible loss of life and of \r\nlivelihood, and we are now desperately working with \r\npeople there to recover their lives and dignity. We \r\nwelcome the acknowledgment of that work and the \r\nendorsement of the International Federation’s \r\nemergency appeal by the Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator, Mr. John Holmes, at his press conference \r\non 16 November. \r\n The International Federation believes that an \r\nincreased emphasis on vulnerability and risk reduction \r\nwill reduce the impact of such disasters. Our \r\nexperience shows that investing in risk reduction \r\nmeasures can save thousands of lives and billions of \r\ndollars every year, and at a fraction of the cost of \r\ndisaster response. We are working with National Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies at one level and with \r\nthe Inter-Agency Standing Committee to deliver a \r\nmore risk-informed humanitarian action. We call on all \r\nGovernments to give new priority to risk reduction \r\nmeasures, and on donor Governments to raise \r\nsignificantly their support for that action. \r\n The increased number of smaller disasters points \r\nto the need to enhance disaster preparedness and \r\nresponse capacity at the local and national levels. That \r\nencompasses effective national disaster management \r\nmechanisms that include a Red Cross or Red Crescent \r\nsociety. Many countries have established such \r\nmechanisms, and good examples of their effectiveness \r\nare available every week, as demonstrated in \r\nBangladesh. \r\n A national society provides a unique bridge \r\nlinking Government capacity and policy to the efforts \r\nof ordinary people in small villages and communities \r\nacross the country. A national society works as an \r\nauxiliary to its national authorities in the humanitarian \r\nfield and is present throughout the country and at the \r\ngrassroots, thanks to its volunteer base in many \r\ncommunities. The IFRC calls on Governments to \r\nenhance partnerships with their National Red Cross or \r\nRed Crescent Society to improve national and local \r\ndisaster preparedness, risk reduction and response \r\ncapacities. \r\n Another vital component of national disaster \r\npreparedness is legal preparedness. The IFRC’s \r\nInternational Disaster Response Laws, Rules And \r\nPrinciples Programme has been developed to help \r\nGovernments improve their regulatory frameworks for \r\nthose disasters that require international humanitarian \r\nassistance. Well-functioning legal and policy \r\nframeworks can minimize bureaucratic barriers and \r\nmaximize the quality and coordination of international \r\naid. \r\n Over the past 18 months, the International \r\nFederation has conducted a multi-stakeholder \r\nconsultation involving over 140 States, national \r\nsocieties, United Nations agencies and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations on how legal issues \r\nemerging in international response to non-conflict \r\ndisasters can be more adequately addressed at the \r\nnational level. The consultation process has resulted in \r\nthe formulation of important recommendations for \r\nstrengthening legal preparedness at the national level, \r\nincluding draft guidelines for strengthening national \r\nlegal preparedness. That will also be discussed at the \r\nthirtieth international conference of the Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent next week in Geneva. \r\n Many local and national disasters do not receive \r\nsufficient attention or assistance from the international \r\ncommunity. IFRC has therefore significantly scaled up \r\nand improved its use of its own Disaster Relief \r\nEmergency Fund (DREF). The Fund delivers start-up \r\ncash to Red Cross and Red Crescent societies within 24 \r\nhours of a disaster to ensure life-saving early action. \r\nFinancial support from DREF, for instance, to the \r\nMozambique Red Cross has enabled it to quickly \r\nrespond to neglected, small-scale disasters, such as \r\ndrought and cholera, as well as to better-known \r\ndisasters, such as this year’s floods. \r\nA/62/PV.55  \r\n \r\n07-60524 4 \r\n \r\n The International Federation relies on donor \r\nsupport to strengthen its support of local and national \r\nresponse to small-scale disasters. The Silent \r\nEmergencies Fund of the Netherlands Government and \r\nthe Netherlands Red Cross is an excellent example of \r\npossible funding partnerships and good humanitarian \r\ndonorship in that field. \r\n Although I have focused on climate-related \r\ndisasters, we also continue to respond to industrial \r\ndisasters. The inclusion in this debate of the agenda \r\nitem relevant to the Chernobyl disaster is an important \r\nreminder of just that need. Since 1990, the IFRC, \r\ntogether with the national societies of Belarus, Ukraine \r\nand Russia, have been implementing the Chernobyl \r\nHumanitarian Assistance and Rehabilitation \r\nProgramme (CHARP) to address the basic needs of \r\nthose living in the area affected by the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster. \r\n After 17 years, CHARP has accumulated unique \r\npractical experience in how to support affected \r\npopulations and establish early detection, which can be \r\nused in preparing and responding to future industrial \r\naccidents and disasters. However, despite considerable \r\ncontributions from the Irish Government and the \r\nJapanese Red Cross, our appeal for 2008-2009 remains \r\nseriously underfunded. The IFRC calls on \r\nGovernments to support the human development \r\nactivities undertaken by national societies, including \r\nthose to be outlined by the United Nations action plan \r\nfor Chernobyl recovery to 2016. The IFRC also calls \r\non Governments to sustain their political will and \r\nengagement in the tripartite ministerial process. \r\n The IFRC is determined to reduce the number of \r\ndeaths, injuries, illnesses and overall impact from \r\ndisasters, diseases and public health emergencies. We \r\nare committed to coordinating with the United Nations \r\nand all relevant stakeholders in our humanitarian action \r\nand to supporting local and national initiatives. On the \r\noccasion of this important debate, I would like to \r\nremind us all that this requires better preparedness and \r\ncontingency planning, more flexible funding, an \r\nincreased focus on risk reduction at the community \r\nlevel and upward, and a readiness to effectively \r\naddress the humanitarian consequences of climate \r\nchange. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/4 of 16 October 1992, \r\nI now call on the observer of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration. \r\n Mr. Dall’Oglio (International Organization for \r\nMigration): At the outset, on behalf of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration (IOM), I would like to \r\nexpress our deepest sympathy to the Government and \r\nthe people of Bangladesh at this moment of suffering \r\nfor the loss of human lives and the devastating \r\nconsequences caused by Cyclone Sidr. \r\n Once again, the General Assembly debate on the \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations is \r\ntaking place in the wake of yet another major natural \r\ndisaster. That in itself is a somber reminder that the \r\nincidence and severity of disasters associated with \r\nnatural hazards continue to intensify. \r\n Strengthening cooperation on humanitarian \r\nassistance in the field of natural disasters is a topic \r\nintrinsically characterized by collaboration and \r\npartnership between a broad range of stakeholders, \r\nparticularly in the areas most relevant to IOM’s \r\noperational work: situations of population \r\ndisplacement, sudden population movements, and \r\nforced migration within and across borders. \r\n The relationship between the environment and \r\nmigration is now attracting increased attention. The \r\ncomplex links between environmental change, human \r\nsecurity and migration are yet to be fully understood, \r\nbut undoubtedly, the human impact associated with \r\nnatural disasters due to climate change and \r\nvulnerabilities linked to population growth, \r\nenvironmental degradation and unplanned \r\nurbanization, among other factors, is on the rise. \r\n While certainly not the only scenario leading to \r\nenvironmentally induced migration, large-scale human \r\ndisplacement in the wake of natural and sudden \r\ncalamities is perhaps the most familiar one. \r\nDevastating tsunamis, earthquakes and floods have \r\nuprooted communities, leaving millions without shelter \r\nand basic services. In some cases, the restoration of \r\nlivelihood in affected areas becomes permanently \r\ncompromised, making return unfeasible. However, it is \r\nalso recognized that the scale of displacement causing \r\nwhat we now call environmental migration as a result \r\nof the gradual deterioration of the environment is far \r\ngreater than the displacement resulting from individual \r\nevents, even catastrophic events. IOM has been called \r\nupon to contribute to this debate and to advance an \r\n A/62/PV.55\r\n \r\n5 07-60524 \r\n \r\nintergovernmental dialogue on these emerging but \r\ncrucial topics. The forthcoming Council of IOM, to be \r\nheld next week in Geneva, will devote one of its \r\nsessions to climate change, environment and migration. \r\n IOM is a committed actor in the ongoing \r\nhumanitarian reform process, alongside humanitarian \r\npartners from the United Nations system and the Red \r\nCross Movement, including as an active participant in \r\nthe cluster approach and within the Global \r\nHumanitarian Platform. Inter-agency collaboration in \r\nthe implementation of the cluster approach within the \r\nInter-Agency Standing Committee is now beginning to \r\noffer preliminary but promising indications of the \r\nachievements that can be made in terms of improved \r\ncoordination and coherence, if this approach is \r\nfollowed consistently by all partners. \r\n As we near the two-year mark of the cluster \r\napproach, we have an opportunity to highlight both its \r\nachievements and the challenges it faces. IOM has \r\nbeen participating in the elaboration of the cluster \r\napproach and assumed the role of global cluster lead \r\nfor camp coordination and camp management in \r\ninternal displacement situations resulting from natural \r\ndisasters, for which the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees has the \r\ncorresponding lead in situations of conflict-induced \r\ndisplacement. That joint approach is facilitating the \r\nbuilding of partnerships and synergies at both the \r\ncentral and field levels with greater coordination and \r\ncollaboration. The cluster approach should be seen as a \r\nway to better respond to the needs of those displaced \r\nby conflict or natural disasters. It supports national \r\nresponses and fills gaps where the national authorities \r\nneed international support and solidarity. National \r\nGovernments should be able to call upon any of the \r\ncluster leads as a focal point in relevant sectors \r\nwhenever appropriate. \r\n While it is a cluster lead in camp coordination \r\nand camp management, IOM also continues to work on \r\na variety of other, no less important, areas in \r\nemergencies, providing assistance and protection to the \r\ndisplaced. The IOM response to the issue of internally \r\ndisplaced persons (IDPs) continues to grow in \r\ncollaboration with others in the areas of shelter, early \r\nrecovery and transition, safe evacuation and \r\ntransportation, return and integration. Additionally, \r\nwith a new focus on protection in emergencies, IOM is \r\nactive in the protection cluster and is carrying out \r\ntraining for emergency staff to ensure that protection \r\nissues are mainstreamed throughout our operations. \r\n Among the various emergency funding \r\nmechanisms available to intergovernmental \r\norganizations such as IOM, we would like to highlight \r\nthe relevance and usefulness of the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund (CERF), which allowed IOM to \r\nquickly deploy capacities and resources in response to \r\n16 crises in 2007 alone. An increase of the contribution \r\nto CERF so that it may reach its target goal by 2008 \r\nwould certainly be a most welcome development. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/62/323) \r\nalso touches on the topic of the possible use of military \r\nassets in disaster settings. IOM particularly welcomes \r\nthe commissioning of the independent study on the \r\neffectiveness of using foreign military assets in \r\ninternational disaster response, as it is crucial to \r\nidentifying best practices for their deployment, \r\ncoordination and use in disaster situations. While we \r\nbelieve that humanitarian organizations must continue \r\nto be at the forefront of humanitarian aid, the scale of \r\nsome recent disasters has shown that in certain \r\nsituations national and international military forces \r\nhave the necessary capacity at their disposal to respond \r\nin an adequate and timely manner. The logistical \r\nsupport and expertise associated with such assets can \r\nprove lifesaving in terms of transportation and in \r\nreaching remote and vulnerable communities. IOM-\r\ncivil-military cooperation has contributed to the \r\nestablishment of disaster preparedness and \r\nmanagement teams that have strengthened and \r\nsustained national capacity to more successfully deal \r\nwith such crises, such as the response to the earthquake \r\nin Pakistan, to the tsunamis in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, \r\nand in Afghanistan. \r\n To conclude, IOM is committed to those most \r\nvulnerable in times of crisis and remains dedicated to \r\nworking resourcefully and proficiently with its partners \r\nin the Inter-Agency Standing Committee. We express \r\nhere our deep appreciation to our partners and \r\nsupporters, in particular to the Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator and the leadership of the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs for their \r\nunwavering commitment to the improvement of \r\nhumanitarian response capacities. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 48/265 of 24 August \r\nA/62/PV.55  \r\n \r\n07-60524 6 \r\n \r\n1994, I now call on the observer for the Sovereign \r\nMilitary Order of Malta. \r\n Mr. Humphreys (Sovereign Military Order of \r\nMalta): Allow me to express my sincere thanks, on \r\nbehalf on the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of \r\nMalta, for the opportunity to take the floor and present \r\nthe views of the Order on the strengthening of the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance of the United Nations. Also, on behalf of the \r\nOrder, I extend our condolences to the people of \r\nBangladesh on the great harm done by the recent \r\ncyclone. They remain in our thoughts. \r\n In the past year, large-scale natural disasters \r\nalone affected 143 million people and resulted in more \r\nthan 23,000 deaths. Of course, natural disasters are not \r\nthe only tragedies that require an emergency \r\nhumanitarian response. The Order is pleased that the \r\nCentral Emergency Respond Fund (CERF) continues to \r\nmake progress towards its objective of improving field-\r\nlevel coordination and further strengthening the \r\nhumanitarian response of the United Nations in often \r\nunderfunded crises. The Order of Malta fully \r\nrecognizes the need for coordination in the field and \r\nthe pre-eminent role that mechanisms like CERF and \r\nUnited Nations agencies can play in that respect. \r\nHowever, the Order believes that management and \r\nfunding should not be overly centralized. \r\n The Order of Malta, with its more than 80,000 \r\ndedicated volunteers working in 120 countries, works \r\nactively in partnership with United Nations agencies, \r\nStates and local and international non-governmental \r\norganizations to further strengthen a synchronized \r\nresponse to humanitarian challenges. \r\n For example, in Burkina Faso, serious flooding at \r\nthe beginning of September killed or injured dozens of \r\npeople, displaced 28,000 and washed away vast \r\nagricultural lands. At the request of the Ministry of \r\nSocial Affairs, the Order in Burkina Faso provided \r\ncommunity tents, camp beds and blankets. Also, \r\nemergency and ambulance corps, set up by the Order’s \r\nFrench Association, helped to transport victims to the \r\nnearest hospital structures. \r\n In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \r\nOrder of Malta, in collaboration with the World Food \r\nProgramme (WFP), launched a comprehensive food \r\ndistribution programme that provides approximately \r\n5,000 internally displaced families from the \r\ncommunity of Ninja in Bakavu in the Kivu province \r\nwith 368 tons of food. Safety for the Order’s personnel \r\nduring the distributions was ensured by local \r\nadministration and military authorities. \r\n In the case of an emergency situation, it is \r\nimperative for humanitarian assistance not only to \r\nprovide immediate relief to victims, but to develop \r\nlong-term support systems. The areas affected by the \r\nIndian Ocean tsunami disaster are one case in which \r\nthat transition is vital, and it is there that the Order has \r\ndemonstrated its ability to broaden its role from \r\nimmediate relief to long-term development. \r\nImmediately following the tsunami, the Order of \r\nMalta, in close cooperation with local partner \r\norganizations, was in South India providing emergency \r\nrelief in the form of clothing, shelter, food and medical \r\naid for flood victims and, in parallel, assessing projects \r\nfor the reconstruction phase. \r\n As the Secretary-General’s report mentions, the \r\nprevalence of HIV/AIDS in the Indian States affected \r\nby the tsunami is one of the highest in the country. In \r\nthe Tamil Nadu region, the Order employed its \r\nexperience with the virus to start a comprehensive \r\nprevention project in 33 villages, and then expanded its \r\ncommitment to fighting the infection. In addition to \r\nlearning how to prevent and control further \r\ntransmission of the disease, people learn how to live \r\nwith the disease and affected family members receive \r\ntraining on extended home-based care and support. \r\nProjects with timetables stretching far into the future \r\nare planned and executed in close consultation with \r\nnational authorities, ensuring the Order’s lasting and \r\nmeaningful presence in an area. \r\n The Order always strives to accomplish two goals \r\nin the execution of its humanitarian work. First, it \r\nseeks to place local non-governmental organizations at \r\nthe centre of the relief effort and the training of local \r\nstaff at the core of many of its projects. Secondly, the \r\nOrder strongly believes that a long-term commitment is \r\nnecessary to achieving a lasting impact on the \r\ncommunity. That is exemplified in our support to the \r\nPalestinian people. The Order of Malta, for 17 years, \r\nhas operated the Holy Family Hospital of Bethlehem-\r\nPalestine, where more than 36,000 healthy children \r\nhave been delivered. Those works are often carried out \r\nunder difficult and dangerous conditions. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on the issue \r\nstates that the safety of humanitarian and United \r\nNations personnel remains precarious. Significant \r\n A/62/PV.55\r\n \r\n7 07-60524 \r\n \r\nmeasures have been taken to improve the safety and \r\nsecurity of humanitarian aid workers, but they continue \r\nto be victims of physical attacks, threats and robberies. \r\nThey are often the first to respond to crises in the most \r\nunsafe regions, and the last to remain – long after \r\nfinancial resources ebb. The current numbers are more \r\nthan just statistics to the Order of Malta, which last \r\nyear lost 29-year-old Dr. Ezmeray Azizi, who was \r\nkilled in an ambush in North-West Afghanistan, along \r\nwith a UNICEF colleague. The Order stands with the \r\nSecretary-General in his appeal to Member States to \r\nfulfil their obligation under the Charter of the United \r\nNations to ensure the safety of all humanitarian aid \r\nworkers. It is only with the full commitment and \r\ncooperation of all Member States that meaningful steps \r\nto enhance security for humanitarian workers can be \r\nachieved. \r\n The Order of Malta’s humanitarian principles, \r\nneutrality, impartiality and independence provide the \r\ncredentials to continue delivery and to improve its \r\neffectiveness in the provision of humanitarian relief \r\nand development. Allow me to assure the Assembly \r\nthat the Order is responding daily to the challenges that \r\nhumanitarian work presents, and we will continue to \r\nclosely follow the leadership and initiatives of the \r\nUnited Nations and its agencies. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 45/6 of 16 October 1990, \r\nI now call on the observer of the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross. \r\n Mr. Buff (International Committee of the Red \r\nCross): The International Committee of the Red Cross \r\n(ICRC) is pleased to address the Assembly on the \r\nsubject of humanitarian coordination, particularly in \r\nconnection with armed conflicts and other situations of \r\nviolence. \r\n The humanitarian world has evolved rapidly over \r\nthe past few years as more and more players enter the \r\narena, often with different objectives, operating \r\nstandards and activities. The humanitarian bodies \r\nwithin the United Nations have embarked on a process \r\nof reform. The main donor Governments have also \r\nbegun a process of collective reflection. Foreign \r\nmilitary assistance is increasingly present in \r\nhumanitarian crises, and the role of secular and \r\nreligious non-governmental organizations, private \r\ncompanies and other players is growing as well. In that \r\nconstantly changing environment, the ICRC intends to \r\nremain the benchmark organization for neutral, \r\nindependent and strictly humanitarian action and for \r\ninternational humanitarian law, both through its action \r\non the ground and in its dialogue with beneficiaries, \r\nGovernments, donors, parties to conflicts and other \r\nstakeholders. \r\n Thanks to its active presence worldwide, the \r\nICRC is able to develop and maintain contacts with all \r\nthose who have a significant impact on the course of \r\narmed conflicts and on the humanitarian problems that \r\nthose conflicts create. Such contacts are crucial in \r\ngaining access to the field and in permitting the ICRC \r\nto conduct its activities for the victims of armed \r\nconflict and other situations of violence. For the ICRC, \r\nhumanitarian coordination should take place first and \r\nforemost in the field. It should be reality-based and \r\naction-oriented; in other words, it should be based on \r\nreal capacities available in the field in emergency \r\nsituations and not on declarations of intent. \r\n The ICRC has a unique mandate to protect \r\npersons affected by armed conflict and it intends to \r\nremain the benchmark organization in that area as well, \r\nin particular by helping to ensure that all parties to \r\narmed conflicts meet their obligations towards \r\ncivilians, by improving the protection afforded to \r\npersons deprived of their liberty, by restoring family \r\nlinks and by obtaining reliable information on missing \r\npersons.  \r\n With regard to assistance, an activity most of the \r\ntime closely linked to protection, the ICRC will \r\ncontinue to maintain its approach of covering all \r\nemergency needs by providing quality health care in \r\ngeneral and medical care in particular, in addition to its \r\nrelief, water and sanitation activities. It is currently \r\nreinforcing its capacity to evaluate the results and \r\nimpact of its activities.  \r\n The ICRC is strongly committed to remaining a \r\nreliable and predictable organization that conducts \r\nitself in a consistent manner and whose work is \r\nunderpinned by a strong culture of accountability. It \r\nwill continue to strengthen its ability to learn from its \r\nown experience and from that of other organizations. \r\n Humanitarian needs in complex emergencies \r\nlargely exceed the capacity of any single organization \r\nto cope. Many agencies with varying objectives and \r\nprinciples for action are therefore needed to respond to \r\nsuch emergencies. The diversity of humanitarian actors \r\nand approaches can enhance the response and alleviate \r\nA/62/PV.55  \r\n \r\n07-60524 8 \r\n \r\nsuffering if all those involved manage to act in a \r\ncomplementary fashion, in keeping with their \r\nrespective operational abilities and expertise and with \r\nthe relevance of their activities to the situation on the \r\nground. \r\n The ICRC takes part in coordination efforts \r\ntogether with other humanitarian organizations. It \r\ncooperates in particular with its natural partners, the \r\nnational Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, in the \r\ncountries where it works. The ICRC invests in those \r\nrelationships with a view to strengthening its own \r\ncapacity for action and that of its partner national \r\nsocieties, in cooperation with the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\nThe ICRC also gives preference to cooperation with \r\nnational societies participating in international relief \r\noperations, in accordance with the rules and \r\nagreements of the International Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Movement. \r\n At the international level, the ICRC continues to \r\ntake part in humanitarian-coordination forums. Those \r\ninclude the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, where it \r\nenjoys the status of standing invitee; the Steering \r\nCommittee for Humanitarian Response and the new \r\nGlobal Humanitarian Platform. In addition, the ICRC \r\nseeks to maintain and strengthen its bilateral relations \r\nwith other major humanitarian organizations. \r\n A good example of that is the agreement reached \r\nin November 2006 by the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the \r\nICRC on individuals and populations of concern to \r\neach organization. Taking into account the specific \r\nmandates and primary roles of the two organizations, \r\nwe have agreed to consult one another and to \r\ncoordinate our activities with a view to ensuring their \r\ncomplementarity, both in the field and at headquarters. \r\n In keeping with its all-victims and all-needs \r\napproach, the ICRC has agreed with UNHCR to pursue \r\na structured dialogue in areas of mutual concern \r\nrelating to protection and assistance for internally \r\ndisplaced persons and refugees. The ICRC is also \r\nengaged in this type of dialogue with other major \r\nhumanitarian agencies within the United Nations \r\nsystem, such as the World Food Programme and \r\nUNICEF. \r\n In conclusion, the ICRC is convinced that, in the \r\nbest interests of the victims of armed conflict and other \r\nsituations of violence, humanitarian coordination \r\nshould maximize the added value that each \r\norganization can bring to the field. The ICRC sees its \r\nadded value mainly in being a truly independent and \r\nneutral humanitarian actor with, globally, very broad \r\naccess to those in need of protection and assistance as \r\nthe consequence of armed conflict or other situations \r\nof violence. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.12, entitled “Strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination of efforts to \r\nstudy, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster”, as orally corrected. \r\n Before proceeding to take action on draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.12, I should like to announce that, \r\nsince its introduction, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, \r\nArgentina, Austria, Cambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, \r\nCroatia, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, \r\nHonduras, India, Israel, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, \r\nLithuania, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, the \r\nPhilippines, Portugal, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, \r\nSpain, Thailand and the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto adopt draft resolution A/62/L.12, as orally \r\ncorrected? \r\n  Draft resolution A/62/L.12, as orally corrected, \r\nwas adopted (resolution 62/9). \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 71 and its sub-items (a), (b) and (c), as \r\nwell as of agenda item 72. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (d) \r\nof agenda item 71? \r\n  It was so decided. \r\n \r\nThe meeting rose at 10.55 a.m. \r\n \r\n"
