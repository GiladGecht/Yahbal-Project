(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nOrganization of work \r\n \r\n The President: Before taking up the items on our \r\nagenda for today, I would like to inform members that \r\nconsideration of agenda item 50, “The role of the \r\nUnited Nations in promoting a new global human \r\norder”, which was scheduled for today, 26 November, \r\nhas been postponed to a later date to be announced.  \r\n Also, I would like to inform members that the \r\nreports of the First Committee will be considered on \r\nWednesday afternoon, 5 December. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 121 \r\n \r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly  \r\n \r\n The President: Today we will consider a subject \r\nof great importance to us all, the agenda item on the \r\n“Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly”. \r\nUnder this title, our efforts to impart new vigour into \r\nthis great institution have been ongoing for over \r\n16 years. We now need to ask ourselves what our \r\nultimate objective is. How can we enhance the \r\nauthority and the efficiency of the Assembly? Our \r\nleaders have called for a stronger United Nations. \r\nCould we not instead call this exercise: “The role of \r\nthe General Assembly in strengthening the United \r\nNations system”?  \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \r\nreaffirmed our central position as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations. It also recognized our role in \r\nsetting standards and codifying international law. We \r\nshould strive to live up to this mandate in our everyday \r\nwork. To promote more effective multilateralism, to \r\nfind global solutions to global problems, it is \r\nincumbent upon all of us to bolster the authority and \r\nthe international standing of this Assembly. \r\n At the opening of the general debate, two months \r\nago, I suggested that the General Assembly should be \r\nmore of a dialogue, not a monologue; more focused on \r\nsubstantive results; more engaging and insightful; and \r\nexemplify this through greater cooperation and mutual \r\nrespect. I would like to thank all Member States for \r\ndelivering on these suggestions through your active \r\ncontribution and proposals.  \r\n Member States are the driving force of our \r\nsuccess and I encourage members to take the initiative. \r\nIt is first and foremost by systematically tackling the \r\nchallenges that we face together and achieving results \r\nthat the General Assembly makes itself stronger, more \r\neffective and more relevant to the lives of the global \r\npublic.  \r\n In this regard, I would like to thank Kyrgyzstan \r\nfor bringing forward a draft resolution on social \r\njustice, which has been sponsored by over 80 Member \r\nStates. Additionally, I note the cooperative way the \r\nCzech Republic and the Dominican Republic \r\napproached elections to the Security Council. I call on \r\nall Member States to continue to work together in this \r\nmanner, enthusiastically and in cooperation, as we have \r\nalso done on mandate review, so that we can make \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 2 \r\n \r\nprogress on other important issues, such as climate \r\nchange, the Millennium Development Goals, and \r\nSecurity Council and management reform. \r\n This means that on system-wide coherence, for \r\nexample, the practical success of the pilot countries, at \r\nthe country level, should sway the opinion of the \r\nAssembly in New York, rather than the other way \r\naround. To give all Member States the opportunity to \r\ndemonstrate our renewed leadership on priority issues, \r\nI shall, inter alia, convene debates on counter-terrorism \r\nin December, on climate change in February 2008 and \r\non management reform in April. \r\n As the Charter stipulates, the relationship \r\nbetween the General Assembly and other principal \r\norgans must be complementary, not competitive. We \r\nmust continue to develop our relationship in an open, \r\ntransparent and cooperative manner to strengthen the \r\nOrganization and better accomplish our common goals. \r\nIn this regard, I maintain regular contact with the \r\nSecretary-General on substantive issues and supported \r\nhis request to brief the Assembly on recent \r\ndevelopments. I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his support and cooperation.  \r\n I have also met periodically with the Presidents \r\nof the Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, as well as with the chairs of the Main \r\nCommittees to enhance cooperation and spread best \r\npractices. Additionally, I have promoted the \r\nAssembly’s interaction with civil society and the \r\nprivate sector and our cooperation with parliaments, \r\nparticularly through the Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Our outreach with these and other important \r\nconstituencies, including the media, must continue to \r\nbe developed. Our message must be consistent, \r\ncompelling and relevant to everyday life and we must \r\nresist giving the perception of institutional \r\nintrospection.  \r\n The effectiveness of the presidency, and his or \r\nher office, has an important impact on the quality and \r\norganization of the General Assembly’s work. This is \r\ncontingent not only on his or her political and \r\ndiplomatic skills, but also on the support and \r\ncooperation of Member States and the Secretariat. \r\n Commensurate with the role envisaged of the \r\npresidency in the Charter, the budget of the presidency, \r\nincluding his or her office, should be financed entirely \r\nfrom the regular budget, rather than from the current \r\nmakeshift arrangements. In addition, and in proportion \r\nto the growing responsibilities of the presidency, the \r\nOffice of the President should be appropriately staffed \r\nand properly situated within United Nations \r\nHeadquarters. That would ensure that each elected \r\nPresident — whether from a developed or developing \r\ncountry, no matter how large or small — has an equal \r\nopportunity to deliver results. An entirely United \r\nNations-funded budget would enhance the \r\nindependence of the presidency and increase \r\ntransparency and accountability to Member States.  \r\n In Assembly resolution 61/292, Member States \r\ndecided: \r\n “to establish, at its sixty-second session, an ad \r\nhoc working group on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, open to all Member States, to \r\nevaluate and assess the status of implementation \r\nof relevant resolutions, to identify ways to further \r\nenhance the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the Assembly, inter alia, by building \r\non previous resolutions, and to submit a report \r\nthereon to the Assembly.” \r\n I believe that it is particularly important that the \r\nWorking Group focus on ensuring that existing \r\nresolutions are fully implemented. It could also \r\nconsider other practical steps to improve our working \r\nmethods, such as finalizing a repository of best \r\npractices for the General Assembly and its subsidiary \r\nbodies and periodically updating the rules of procedure \r\nto include recent Assembly decisions. \r\n The Working Group will begin to consider these \r\nand other issues shortly. Today, I am very pleased to \r\nannounce that His Excellency Ambassador Towpik, \r\nPermanent Representative of Poland, and \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Loizaga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Paraguay, have agreed to act as \r\nCo-Chairs of the Working Group. I would like to ask \r\nall Member States to extend your fullest cooperation \r\nand support to the Co-Chairs and invite members to \r\nbring forward constructive proposals and practical \r\nsuggestions.  \r\n Mr. Lemos Godinho (Portugal): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The \r\ncandidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and \r\nMontenegro, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n3 07-61162 \r\n \r\nMoldova and Georgia, align themselves with this \r\nstatement.  \r\n The European Union wishes to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this meeting and for \r\nproviding the membership with an opportunity to look \r\nahead to our discussion of General Assembly \r\nrevitalization during the sixty-second session. \r\n But before doing so, we would also like to \r\nexpress our appreciation for the efforts undertaken \r\nduring the sixty-first session by the former President of \r\nthe General Assembly, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, aimed at revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly, and specifically the convening of thematic \r\ndebates on issues of particular relevance to the \r\nmembership.  \r\n We are grateful as well to the co-facilitators, \r\nAmbassador Daniele Bodini of San Marino and \r\nAmbassador Paul Badji of Senegal, for their hard work \r\nand widespread consultations, which have drawn active \r\nparticipation from the European Union (EU).  \r\n The EU supports efforts aimed at strengthening \r\nthe General Assembly’s role and authority, in line with \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, the principles and \r\nobjectives outlined in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome document and the measures adopted in \r\nseveral relevant General Assembly resolutions.  \r\n At this stage we believe that efforts at the \r\npractical level are paramount to ensure an overhaul of \r\nthe General Assembly’s performance.  \r\n The EU strongly believes that the General \r\nAssembly revitalizes itself, first and foremost, when it \r\ntakes up issues of genuine concern to our peoples and \r\nto the international community as a whole. It is our \r\ncollective duty to engage in meaningful initiatives, to \r\nlive up to the expectations of our peoples and to make \r\nthe work of the General Assembly ever more relevant.  \r\n Furthermore, it is the responsibility of each and \r\nevery member State to apply in its daily business what \r\nhas already been agreed by all and considered useful \r\nand necessary to revitalize this body. We recall that the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly has been an \r\nongoing process over several years and that numerous \r\nresolutions have already been adopted in the past. \r\nWhat was agreed at that time should be implemented, \r\nas was acknowledged by this Assembly when it \r\nadopted resolution 61/292.  \r\n Implementation will also be at the core of the \r\nproceedings of the ad hoc working group to be \r\nestablished at this session, as foreseen in the resolution \r\nI mentioned earlier. The mandate given to the ad hoc \r\nworking group is, inter alia, “to evaluate and assess the \r\nstatus of implementation of relevant resolutions” \r\n(resolution 61/292, para. 2).  \r\n Not all the EU’s well-known views and positions \r\non General Assembly revitalization are fully reflected \r\nin those resolutions. On many occasions we would \r\nhave liked to see the General Assembly adopt bolder \r\nand more ambitious decisions that reflected our \r\npositions better.  \r\n We believe, however, that promoting the \r\nimplementation and the consolidation of existing \r\nresolutions and decisions will bring real added value \r\nand will impact significantly on the way the General \r\nAssembly, and the United Nations as a whole, conducts \r\nits work.  \r\n At the end of the current session we may well \r\ncome to the conclusion that some of the shortcomings \r\nwe recognize in the way that the General Assembly \r\ncarries out its work and in the way that the major \r\nUnited Nations bodies relate to each other can be \r\naddressed by means of effective implementation of \r\nexisting resolutions and decisions. To this end we look \r\nforward to the timely submission of a comprehensive \r\nreport by the Secretary-General, as envisaged in \r\nparagraph 1 of resolution 61/292, so that that report \r\ncan constitute a valuable basis for an informed and \r\naction-oriented discussion in the framework of the \r\nad hoc working group.  \r\n We look forward to working with the persons you \r\nhave appointed to conduct our work in the current \r\nsession, under your overall leadership.  \r\n The EU undertakes to engage, in a constructive \r\nand pragmatic manner, in the proceedings of the ad hoc \r\nworking group with a view to contributing to a \r\nsuccessful outcome of our collective efforts aimed at \r\nfurther revitalizing the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\n(NAM).  \r\n First of all, I would like to express NAM’s \r\nappreciation for the hard work done by Ambassador \r\nBadji of Senegal and Ambassador Bodini of San \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 4 \r\n \r\nMarino, the co-facilitators during the sixty-first \r\nsession.  \r\n In adopting resolution 61/292 the General \r\nAssembly decided to assess during the current session \r\nthe extent to which all its previous resolutions and \r\ndecisions related to the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly have been implemented.  \r\n At the outset of this debate, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement would like to recall the validity and \r\nrelevance of its principles and positions regarding this \r\nmatter.  \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement reiterates that the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich must be guided by the principles of democracy, \r\ntransparency and accountability and must be achieved \r\nthrough consultations, is a critical component of the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations. Its \r\nobjectives should continue to be to strengthen the role \r\nand position of the General Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n The NAM also emphasizes that the improvement \r\nof the Assembly’s procedural and working methods is \r\nonly a first step towards more substantive \r\nimprovements aimed at restoring and enhancing the \r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly, including \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nas stipulated in Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 35 of the \r\nCharter.  \r\n The NAM, while expressing its readiness to \r\ncontinue to support all ongoing efforts to strengthen \r\nthe central role and authority of the Assembly, wishes \r\nto underline that it will continue to oppose any reform \r\nproposal that seeks to contradict this objective. It will \r\nalso continue to oppose any approach that seeks to or \r\ncould result in undermining or minimizing the \r\nachievements of the General Assembly, diminishing its \r\ncurrent role and functioning or raising questions about \r\nits relevance and credibility.  \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement expresses its \r\nconcern that during the previous rounds of \r\nconsultations, recurrent proposals were made, aimed at \r\nundermining the central role of the Assembly and its \r\nauthority, including in relation to its prerogatives \r\nregarding administrative and budgetary questions. It is \r\nthe hope of the NAM that any forthcoming proposals \r\naimed at upgrading the revitalization of the work of the \r\nAssembly will be made in a spirit which excludes any \r\nsuch challenges. \r\n With respect to assessing the status of \r\nimplementation of all prior resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, in \r\nparticular landmark resolutions 58/126, 58/316, 59/313 \r\nand 60/286, the NAM is deeply disappointed that, at \r\nthis stage of the sixty-second session, the report \r\nrequested by the General Assembly in paragraph 1 of \r\nits resolution 61/292 in continuation of the reporting \r\nrequirements established by resolutions 59/313 and \r\n60/286 has not been made available to the membership, \r\nthus depriving participants in the forthcoming \r\nconsultations of the necessary political guidance that \r\nwas expected to emanate from the Assembly on the \r\noccasion of this debate. Nonetheless, the NAM wishes \r\nat this stage to make the following comments on a \r\nnumber of aspects. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement notes with growing \r\nconcern the continuous attempts on the part of the \r\nSecurity Council to encroach upon other principal \r\norgans of the United Nations and their subsidiary \r\nbodies with respect to issues that clearly fall within the \r\nfunctions and powers of those latter structures. That \r\nwas, again, the case recently when the Security \r\nCouncil held a thematic debate on the effects of \r\nclimate change (see S/PV.5663), thus departing not \r\nonly from the provisions of the Charter but also from \r\nthe agreement reached among Member States to \r\nincrease coordination and cooperation among the \r\nprincipal organs as well as complementarity in their \r\nwork programmes. \r\n The NAM underscores, once again, the need for \r\nfull respect for the functions and powers of the \r\nprincipal organs, in particular the General Assembly, \r\nand for maintaining the balance among them in \r\naccordance with the Charter. In this respect, the NAM \r\nwelcomes the proposals of the President of the General \r\nAssembly to convene a panel discussion on climate \r\nchange and an informal meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the implementation of the Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy, and we look forward to \r\nmaking a substantive contribution at those events. \r\nFurther, the NAM remains particularly concerned \r\nabout the exercise of the Security Council setting \r\nnorms and establishing definitions in areas beyond its \r\ncompetence. \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n5 07-61162 \r\n \r\n The NAM expresses its satisfaction that the \r\nGeneral Assembly has played a central role, both \r\nduring the preparatory process of the 2005 World \r\nSummit and during the follow-up phase; this has \r\nallowed the Assembly to reassert its prerogatives. It \r\nalso expresses its satisfaction at the progress made in \r\nimplementing previous decisions, such as the \r\nimprovement of transitional arrangements between the \r\noutgoing and incoming Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly and at the level of the bureaux of the Main \r\nCommittees, the reinforcement of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and its increased \r\nmedia exposure, the valuable contribution made by the \r\nMain Committees in improving their methods of work, \r\nin particular by improving the interactive nature of \r\ntheir debates, and in many other areas. \r\n However, NAM members remain convinced that \r\ngenuine revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly cannot afford to avoid addressing the main \r\nissue: the lack of implementation of all General \r\nAssembly resolutions and the underlying cause for \r\nthat, namely, the lack of adequate resources made \r\navailable to that end. \r\n In this regard, the NAM is encouraged by the fact \r\nthat Member States have been able to reach a common \r\nunderstanding on how to reinvigorate the discussion on \r\nmandates review, with a view to rationalizing the \r\nreallocation of freed resources. It is the hope of the \r\nNAM that the issue of providing adequate resources for \r\nthe implementation of the decisions of the General \r\nAssembly will be addressed in a similar spirit. \r\n Finally, the NAM looks forward to the convening \r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly, as called for \r\nby resolution 61/292, and expresses its readiness to \r\nparticipate in the Group’s work in order to arrive at a \r\ndetailed and fair assessment of the status of \r\nimplementation of all previous decisions and, if \r\ndeemed necessary, to work towards the adoption of a \r\nnew resolution aimed at further improvements. \r\n Before I conclude, allow me to congratulate the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Poland and Paraguay for \r\ntheir appointments as co-Chairs of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group for the sixty-second session. I thank \r\nthem for agreeing to assume this heavy task. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): My delegation is pleased to \r\nparticipate in this debate on agenda item 121, on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\nMalaysia wishes to associate itself with the statement \r\njust made by the representative of Algeria on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). \r\n I would like to recall paragraph 30 of the \r\nMillennium Declaration, whereby our heads of State or \r\nGovernment resolved to restore the central position of \r\nthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations, and to enable it to play that role effectively. \r\nThat call was reaffirmed by our heads of State or \r\nGovernment during the 2005 World Summit, where \r\nthey reaffirmed the central position of the General \r\nAssembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations, as well as \r\nthe role of the Assembly in the process of standard-\r\nsetting and the codification of international law. They \r\nalso called for strengthening the relationship between \r\nthe General Assembly and the other principal organs to \r\nensure better coordination on topical issues that require \r\ncoordinated action by the United Nations, in \r\naccordance with their respective mandates.  \r\n We have been discussing the issue of the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly since 1991, and \r\nwe have made some progress over the years. It is \r\nimportant that this process continue as it is part of the \r\nongoing process of United Nations reform. As the \r\nGeneral Assembly is the most representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations, we must dedicate ourselves to \r\nfinding consensus on measures to revitalize the \r\nAssembly so that it can fulfil its mandate in accordance \r\nwith the Charter. We must build upon the work done at \r\nprevious sessions; the key to success is the \r\nimplementation of their resolutions. We look to your \r\nleadership in this process, Mr. President. \r\n In this regard, we share the sentiments of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement about the absence of the status \r\nreport that has been requested since the fifty-ninth \r\nsession on the implementation of all resolutions \r\nregarding the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nThis call was most recently reiterated in resolution \r\n61/292. The status report would be an important input \r\nfor our discussions, as it would allow us to take stock \r\nof what has been implemented and how to move \r\nforward. In the absence of such a report, we will be \r\nunable to take effective steps and measures to \r\nrevitalize the General Assembly. We call for the timely \r\nissuance of the status report to enable Member States \r\nto study it and prepare for the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nthat has just been established.  \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 6 \r\n \r\n We would also like to hear from you, \r\nMr. President, concerning your proposals on the work \r\nplan for the Ad Hoc Working Group. It is important \r\nthat the discussions on this item, like those on other \r\nagenda items, be held in an open, transparent and \r\ninclusive manner. \r\n Any reform process should lead to the \r\nstrengthening of the central role of the General \r\nAssembly, as well as restoring and enhancing its role, \r\nincluding in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, as provided for in the Charter. That entails \r\nstrengthening its relationship and coordination with \r\nother organs. That has been adequately addressed in \r\nprevious resolutions, which have stressed the need to \r\nfully respect and maintain the balance among the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations within their \r\nrespective purviews and mandates under the Charter. \r\n Efforts to enable the General Assembly to \r\nperform its functions as set out in the Charter must not \r\nbe limited to procedural measures pertaining to its \r\nworking methods. Improving the Assembly’s \r\nprocedures and working methods is only a step towards \r\nfurther substantive improvements in and revitalization \r\nof the Assembly, as stipulated in resolution 55/285. \r\n If the General Assembly is to maintain its central \r\nposition as the chief deliberative and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations, it must be cognizant of \r\nthe current developments and take steps to address \r\nthem. We welcome the initiative to have thematic \r\ndebates, panel discussions and high-level segments \r\nwith a view to producing concrete, practical and \r\naction-oriented results. We welcome the identification \r\nof the themes for the present session. In that regard, \r\nMr. President, we are pleased that you organized the \r\nhigh-level event on climate change in September and \r\nhave identified the continued consideration of the \r\nagenda item on climate change as a matter of priority \r\nfor the General Assembly. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that my \r\ndelegation will work constructively with you, \r\nMr. President, in launching the process of consultations \r\namong Member States in the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nconcerning the status report on the implementation of \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, on behalf of my delegation, I wish to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on the manner in \r\nwhich you are conducting this debate, which is \r\nparticularly important to Member States. I also wish to \r\ncongratulate the representatives of Senegal and San \r\nMarino on their considerable efforts during the sixty-\r\nfirst session as facilitators on the issue of the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement concerning the agenda item \r\nbefore the Assembly today. We wish to make the \r\nfollowing additional comments. \r\n With regard to strengthening the role and the \r\nauthority of the General Assembly, this year, once \r\nagain, we continue to debate the issue of the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\nAgain, we must emphasize that this is a rather sensitive \r\nprocess that should be pursued with resolve, \r\nseriousness and commitment by all Member States. It \r\nwas in that spirit that our heads of State or Government \r\nreaffirmed, at the September 2005 World Summit, the \r\nAssembly’s central role as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n My delegation believes that strengthening the \r\nrole and the authority of the General Assembly \r\ninvolves, inter alia, including in its agenda obvious \r\nissues that are of particular importance, both to the \r\nOrganization and to the international community at \r\nlarge. It also involves holding major thematic debates \r\nso that Member States can come to agreement on major \r\nsubstantive and timely issues. In that context, we \r\nwelcome the quality of the thematic debates held at the \r\nprevious session — a practice that, we are convinced, \r\nwill continue under your presidency, Sir. \r\n Furthermore, we believe that strengthening the \r\nrole and the authority of the General Assembly also \r\nrequires that we recognize its role regarding the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\nIndeed, while it is generally acknowledged that \r\nArticle 24 of the Charter entrusts the Security Council \r\nwith primary responsibility in this area, that \r\nresponsibility is not exclusive. The General Assembly \r\nshould thus give greater consideration to issues of \r\ninternational peace and security, in accordance with the \r\nrelevant articles of the Charter and the historic \r\nresolution 377 (V), “Uniting for Peace”. \r\n The issue of the relationship between the General \r\nAssembly and other principal organs of the United \r\nNations should be the object of in-depth consideration. \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n7 07-61162 \r\n \r\nSuch consideration should be carried out in plenary \r\nmeetings and within the framework of an approach \r\nbased on cooperation, maintaining balance and respect \r\nfor the Charter roles of each organ.  \r\n In that spirit, while we appreciate the cooperation \r\nbetween the presidency of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and that of the General Assembly, we believe \r\nthat greater coordination between the two organs would \r\nbe useful, particularly in the choice of thematic debate \r\nsubjects — a choice that must respect the old and new \r\nmandates recognized for the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n The issue of the reports that the Security Council \r\nmust submit to the General Assembly under the \r\nrelevant Charter articles continues to be a focus of our \r\nattention. Indeed, despite repeated appeals by Member \r\nStates, the Council continues to present annual reports \r\nof a factual nature. The Council should also be able to \r\npresent to the Assembly analytical reports, including \r\non specialized subjects. \r\n On another note, I wish to revisit the issue of the \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions. It \r\nmust be noted that respect on the part of all Member \r\nStates for the resolutions adopted by the General \r\nAssembly would greatly contribute to the strengthening \r\nof the Assembly’s authority. My delegation supports \r\nthe various ideas put forward in that regard, aimed at \r\nidentifying the factors that are hindering the \r\nimplementation of resolutions. \r\n Our second subject concerns improving the \r\nworking methods of the General Assembly. We are \r\npleased that a number of measures related to improving \r\nthe Assembly’s working methods have been \r\nimplemented — particularly the Main Committees’ use \r\nin recent years of interactive debates, round tables and \r\nquestion-and-answer sessions. Those practices have \r\nmade it possible to enrich the deliberations and the \r\ndecision-making process of the Main Committees. \r\nHowever, these efforts still fall short of Member States’ \r\nexpectations.  \r\n Likewise, my delegation recognizes the merits of \r\nthe recommendations made by the Secretary-General in \r\nhis report on revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nissued in October 2006 (A/61/483), calling on Member \r\nStates to draft more concise, targeted and concrete \r\nresolutions and decisions and to limit the length of \r\nstatements in the General Assembly and the Main \r\nCommittees. However, we believe that that in no way \r\naffects the sovereign rights of Member States with \r\nregard to taking the floor and submitting draft \r\nresolutions. \r\n At another level, we believe that several of the \r\nmeasures proposed during debates on improving the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s working methods — measures on \r\nwhich no decision has yet been made — should be \r\nreconsidered. That applies to, inter alia, the proposal \r\naimed at organizing the work of the Assembly’s Main \r\nCommittees in two substantive periods per session and \r\nharmonizing the Committees’ best practices, which, it \r\nshould be recalled, differ from Committee to \r\nCommittee.  \r\n My third category of comments concerns the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s role in selecting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The issue of selecting the Secretary-General \r\nhas been debated over the past two years in the Open-\r\nended Working Group, but no concrete measures have \r\nbeen decided upon. We continue to believe that, \r\ntogether, we should consider how Article 97 of the \r\nCharter should be interpreted in terms of greater \r\ninvolvement by Member States, through the General \r\nAssembly, in selecting the Secretary-General. \r\nPreferably, that should be done before the next election \r\nin that regard. \r\n Finally, I wish to express my delegation’s support \r\nfor the mandate adopted by the General Assembly in \r\nAugust to establish, at the sixty-second session, an ad \r\nhoc working group on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly to  \r\n “evaluate and assess the status of implementation \r\nof relevant resolutions, to identify ways to further \r\nenhance the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the Assembly, ... and to submit a \r\nreport thereon to the Assembly.” (resolution \r\n61/292, para. 2) \r\n Mr. President, my delegation is very pleased with \r\nthe establishment of the Working Group that you have \r\njust announced, and we congratulate the Co-Chairs, the \r\nAmbassadors of Poland and Paraguay, pledging to \r\nthem the full support of the Tunisian delegation. \r\n We hope that, in the context of this Working \r\nGroup, the Member States will look into ideas and \r\ninnovations that could return the General Assembly to \r\nits central place in the United Nations system. It is time \r\nto commit to this path seriously and with \r\ndetermination. \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 8 \r\n \r\n Mr. Malmierca Díaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement by \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries. I would like to simply add a few comments \r\non this item.  \r\n Cuba would like to indicate its concern over the \r\nabsence of a report on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, which makes it difficult for the Member \r\nStates to carry out an in-depth consideration of this \r\nimportant question. We reiterate our request for such a \r\nreport to be published by the Secretariat as soon as \r\npossible so as to facilitate a debate of the quality that \r\nthe importance of this issue requires. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is a \r\ndecisive element for true reform of the United Nations. \r\nWe cannot talk about an Organization with more \r\ndemocratic and effective actions, if the General \r\nAssembly does not fully exercise the power that the \r\nCharter confers on it. That process should reaffirm the \r\ncentral role of the General Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations, as recognized by the Charter and \r\nthe Millennium Declaration. \r\n It is important that when this process concludes, \r\nthe Assembly strengthens its characteristics of \r\nindependence and of an organ for comprehensive \r\ndebate, where the freedom of its Member States to \r\naddress the issues of interest to them is not restricted or \r\nlimited. \r\n We underscore the need to achieve an adequate \r\nbalance among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations, in accordance with the Charter, and for the \r\nMember States of the Organization to end attempts to \r\ntransfer General Assembly agenda items to the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n The Security Council must strictly abide by the \r\nCharter’s provisions, as well as by all resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as the main organ of the United \r\nNations, and it must stop interfering in the questions \r\nthat are clearly fall within the functions and powers of \r\nother principal organs of the United Nations and their \r\nsubsidiary bodies. \r\n My delegation would like to express its concern \r\nat the establishment of rules and definitions by the \r\nSecurity Council that exceed its competence, \r\ndisregarding that, in accordance with Article 13 of the \r\nCharter, the General Assembly has the primary \r\nresponsibility for the progressive development of \r\ninternational law and its codification. \r\n In order to avoid those irregularities, which are \r\nsetting precedents within the United Nations system, \r\nthe Presidents of the General Assembly, the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the Security Council must carry \r\nout regular debates and coordinate among themselves \r\nwith regard to the agenda and working plan of the \r\nrespective principal organs they represent in order to \r\nmake them increasingly coherent and complementary. \r\nThis should be carried out in a manner mutually \r\nreinforcing and respectful of the mandates of each \r\norgan, avoiding duplication of effort and interference \r\nin the functions assigned to each. \r\n The failure to implement the numerous Assembly \r\nresolutions must be eliminated. The resolutions \r\nconstitute an important body of norms, but they remain \r\ninert because their non-compliance is related to the \r\nlack of political will on the part of the States that have \r\npolitical, military or economic power. It seems natural, \r\nthen, that this also happens with the numerous \r\nresolutions referring to the reform of the United \r\nNations and to the very revitalization of the Assembly, \r\nsuch as resolutions 58/126, 58/316 and 60/286, whose \r\nlevel of implementation is limited. \r\n Cuba reiterates that the revitalization of the \r\nAssembly must not be merely a bureaucratic process \r\nexposed to the interests and whims of a few rich and \r\npowerful countries who try to impose unilateralism and \r\nuse multilateralism only when it suits their interests. At \r\nthe same time, we further hope that, as a result of such \r\na process, the interaction between the Secretariat and \r\nthe General Assembly will strengthen, so that the \r\nformer can answer more effectively to the mandates \r\nthat the Member States determine. \r\n I conclude my statement by reiterating that in this \r\ncomplex yet necessary process of revitalizing the \r\nAssembly, the Cuban delegation’s full willingness and \r\nconstructive participation can be depended on. \r\n Mr. Malhotra (India): We are pleased to \r\nparticipate in the debate on the revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly and to associate \r\nourselves with the position of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement as expressed by the delegation of Algeria. \r\n The General Assembly is the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations. Its revitalization should restore it to its \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n9 07-61162 \r\n \r\nposition of primacy, as per the Charter. It must ensure \r\nthat the Assembly addresses itself to the developmental \r\nproblems confronting the overwhelming majority of \r\nUnited Nations Member States. A revitalized General \r\nAssembly must also set the global agenda, especially \r\non economic and financial issues. \r\n Over the last few years, Member States have \r\nagreed on certain measures to rationalize and \r\nstreamline the work and agenda of the General \r\nAssembly and to improve its working methods and \r\nthose of its Main Committees. Those efforts have \r\nsought to give a sharper focus to its work. They have \r\nalso led to addressing the needs of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, including during a \r\nperiod of transition. Efforts to trim the heavy burden of \r\npapers submitted to the Assembly have reduced the \r\nvolume of such documentation. Such procedural \r\nchanges mark a useful beginning.  \r\n However, the General Assembly cannot be \r\nrevitalized via better coordination or streamlining of \r\nprocedures alone. Central to revitalization is a focus on \r\nsubstantive measures aimed at restoring and enhancing \r\nthe Assembly’s role and authority to the position \r\noriginally envisaged in the Charter. \r\n The General Assembly can hardly be revitalized \r\nwhile its role, prerogatives and authority are being \r\nundermined by encroachment on its agenda by the \r\nSecurity Council. The balance between the principal \r\norgans of the United Nations envisaged in the Charter \r\nmust be maintained and respected. Of special concern \r\nis the encroachment by the Security Council on issues \r\nthat traditionally fall within the Assembly’s \r\ncompetence, such as the process of standard-setting \r\nand codification of international law. Also of concern \r\nis the holding of thematic debates in the Security \r\nCouncil on issues that frequently fall within the \r\npurview of the General Assembly or the Economic and \r\nSocial Council.  \r\n Resolution 60/286 reiterated that in addition to \r\nthe Security Council making its annual report more \r\nanalytical, it should submit special reports to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. It is also important to fulfil this \r\nprovision while the Council considers ways to further \r\nimprove the quality of its reports to the Assembly. At \r\nthe same time, we should guard against an over-zealous \r\nattitude that may lead to the General Assembly, in turn, \r\nintruding into areas that are primarily the core \r\ncompetence of other United Nations bodies. \r\n It is equally important to implement the \r\nprovisions of previous Assembly resolutions on the \r\nmatter. It may be recalled that a substantive area that \r\nresolution 60/286 attempted to revitalize is the role of \r\nthe Assembly in the selection of the Secretary-General. \r\nIt sought to put in place a more inclusive and \r\ntransparent procedure for the appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General, consistent with Article 97 of the \r\nCharter. Furthermore, resolution 59/313 requested the \r\nPresident of the Assembly to propose interactive \r\ndebates on current issues on the agenda of the \r\nAssembly, in consultation with Member States. A \r\nprocedure for ascertaining the views of Member States \r\nin deciding the themes for such thematic debates would \r\nhelp identify issues of current interest to Members and \r\navoid duplication of discussions elsewhere in the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n In a dynamic and changing world, it is important \r\nto focus on the more substantive aspects of Assembly \r\nrevitalization and to do so on an ongoing basis. In that \r\ncontext, we look forward to the setting up of the open-\r\nended working group, in line with resolution 61/292, \r\nwith a view to enhancing the role, authority, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Assembly through \r\nan implementation of previous resolutions and \r\nconsideration of creative new proposals. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to congratulate the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Paraguay and Poland and \r\nwish them every success in the important work as the \r\nco-chairs of the open-ended working group. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly is debating today one of the most \r\nimportant items on its agenda. That item acquires its \r\nimportance from the nature of the role and authority of \r\nthe Assembly, the chief deliberative and policymaking \r\nbody and the most democratic organ of the \r\nOrganization, not only because it comprises all the \r\nMember States, but also owing to its responsibility for \r\nsupervising the balance of authority and obligations of \r\nthe main and subsidiary organs, following up on the \r\nimplementation of their mandates and taking the \r\nnecessary measures to fulfil them, if deemed necessary. \r\n With those considerations in mind, heads of State \r\nand Government underscored, in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome, the necessity of adhering, within the \r\ncontext of United Nations reform, to the purposes and \r\nthe principles of the Charter and reaffirmed that the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations and an increase in its \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 10 \r\n \r\ncapacity to meet its responsibilities is increasingly \r\nlinked to the ability of the Assembly to exercise its \r\ninstitutional responsibilities. Despite the resolutions \r\nadopted by the Assembly in previous years, which \r\nincluded only some of the important steps needed to \r\nrevitalize its role, many crucial reforms are still needed \r\nin that regard. Such reforms are becoming increasingly \r\ncontroversial and require the sincere political will of \r\nMember States to enhance good governance at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n Egypt associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. I would like, in that \r\nconnection, to stress a number of important points. \r\n First, revitalization of the role of the Assembly \r\nshould be based on monitoring the effective \r\nimplementation of Assembly resolutions on this issue, \r\nwhile continuing to negotiate additional steps aiming at \r\npromoting further effectiveness of the Assembly. Those \r\nendeavours will not be successful if we limit our \r\nactions to rationalizing the agenda and mandates of the \r\nAssembly and its subsidiary committees, and to the \r\nreports submitted to them. Rather, the Assembly should \r\nbe revitalized through a clear plan that starts with \r\nidentifying these resolutions and the concrete \r\nobligations they stipulate and ends with their full and \r\neffective implementation. \r\n Secondly, despite the success of the election of \r\nthe eighth Secretary-General of the Organization and \r\nhis appointment by the Assembly by consensus upon \r\nthe recommendation of the Security Council, the \r\ndeliberations on the responsibility and authority of the \r\nAssembly vis-à-vis the Council’s role highlighted the \r\nfact that we must continue our search for ways and \r\nmeans to increase the role of the Assembly in that \r\nprocess. That should be accomplished in accordance \r\nwith the provisions of the Charter and resolutions \r\n51/241 and 60/286. A transparent mechanism should be \r\nestablished that allows the Assembly to evaluate \r\ncandidates for the position and submit their names for \r\nconsideration by the Council. It should also oversee the \r\ncriteria that govern the Council’s recommendations to \r\nthe Assembly, without prejudice to, on one hand, the \r\nrole of the Council in making recommendations and, \r\non the other hand, the authority of the Assembly in \r\napproving such recommendations and appointing the \r\nrecommended candidate or suggesting alternative \r\ncandidates to the Council. \r\n Thirdly, it is important to enhance the principal \r\nrole of the Assembly in areas related to international \r\npeace and security, in accordance with Articles 10, 11, \r\n12, 14 and 35 of the Charter. That role should not be \r\nlimited to financing United Nations missions in \r\nsituations of conflict or war, but should rather play a \r\nreal and concrete preventive role and contribute to \r\nefforts aimed at achieving the settlement of current \r\ndisputes. \r\n Fourthly, it is imperative to respect the distinction \r\nstipulated in the Charter between the roles and \r\nfunctions of the principal organs of the Organization. \r\nWe must also strengthen the prerogatives of the \r\nAssembly in overseeing the way the Security Council \r\nfulfils its main responsibilities in prioritizing the \r\ninterests of the general membership of the United \r\nNations over the national interests of its Members. \r\n Fifthly, we must promote the capacity of the \r\nAssembly to address cases where the Security Council \r\nfails to undertake its obligations to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security, owing to a lack of \r\nunanimity among its permanent members that \r\nnegatively affects the possibilities for settling those \r\nconflicts, and leads to the prolonging of those conflicts \r\nand to the suffering of people. This increases our \r\nconviction that an expansion of the membership of the \r\nCouncil is necessary in order to include new permanent \r\nmembers with the same rights and privileges as the \r\ncurrent members, including the veto. That would strike \r\na much-needed balance between the international \r\nPowers in the Council. \r\n In expressing their concern over the magnitude of \r\nthis situation, the heads of State and Government of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement requested, at their summit \r\nmeeting in Havana, the permanent representatives of \r\nthe members of the Movement to submit a draft \r\nresolution to the Assembly aimed at restoring its \r\nauthority in undertaking the actions needed to deal \r\neffectively with cases in which international peace and \r\nsecurity are endangered but the Council has failed to \r\naddress, owing to the misuse of the veto power, \r\nparticularly in cases of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity, war crimes and the cessation of hostilities \r\nbetween belligerent parties. Members of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement will draft that resolution as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\n Sixthly, in the same context, we must enhance the \r\ncapacity of the Assembly to uphold the principles that \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n11 07-61162 \r\n \r\ngovern the assessment of Member States’ contributions \r\nto the Organization’s budget, the most important of \r\nwhich is the capacity to pay, and to ensure that the \r\nprinciples of justice and equality embodied in the \r\nprinciple of “one country, one vote” will continue to \r\ngovern our decision-making. That indicates the need to \r\nrestore balance and confidence-building between \r\ndeveloping and developed countries and the \r\nSecretariat, in order to implement the mandates \r\nestablished by Assembly resolutions and to ensure the \r\nfinancial resources necessary in that regard. \r\n In order to achieve the aspirations of the general \r\nmembership with regard to the revitalization of the role \r\nand authority of the Assembly, the ad hoc open-ended \r\nworking group should be looking at the proposals of \r\nMember States that seek to lay down a framework for \r\nthe implementation of previous resolutions on this \r\nimportant issue. At the same time, they should discuss \r\nthe status of implementation of Assembly resolutions \r\nand the means to ensure follow-up on their \r\nimplementation, including through a comprehensive \r\nmechanism ensuring the commitment of Member States \r\nto implementing those resolutions, and even, if needed, \r\nby amending the Charter to achieve those aims. In \r\naddition, they must exert a sincere parallel effort in \r\nreviewing mandates in order to decrease the burden on \r\nthe Assembly by avoiding redundancy and duplication. \r\nThat will ultimately revitalize the role of the Assembly \r\nby increasing the obligatory nature of its resolutions \r\nand decreasing redundancy. This also represents a more \r\nintegrated approach to all aspects of the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Mr. Gallardo (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nchallenges of globalization call for governance even in \r\nthe international sphere, and we should not be \r\nsurprised that since 1991 Member States have decided \r\nto act within the United Nations to eliminate the threats \r\nand paralysis that were caused by the bipolarity of the \r\ncold war. Since 1991, we have gone through different \r\nphases in this attempt. Today, we are more fragmented, \r\nand no country alone can manage globalization. The \r\npower of each of the nations represented here has its \r\nlimits. \r\n Today, the United Nations is, more than ever, the \r\ngeneral reference for the international agenda and its \r\npriorities. It is our responsibility as States to guide the \r\nOrganization with efficiency, clarity, vision and a \r\nstrategic approach, in order to help to resolve the \r\nproblems of peace and security, development and the \r\nenvironment, human rights, the right to humanitarian \r\nassistance, international law and the coherence \r\nproblems of the United Nations, its mandates, its \r\nSecretariat and its other bodies. This is an enormous \r\ntask that lies in the hands of 192 delegations. \r\n We acknowledge the leadership of the Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly. They must guide our debates \r\nat every session, with a short agenda of priorities. But \r\nin the final analysis, it is we, the Member States \r\nconcerned, that must own this process. There can be no \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly without the \r\npolitical will to work together, to achieve goals in areas \r\nthat interest all parties and, in that way, to contribute \r\nconstructively to the adoption of significant decisions \r\nby the General Assembly. \r\n Our discussions on how to tackle climate change; \r\non how to make progress in attaining the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the goals of the partnership for \r\ndevelopment; how to be more creative and show more \r\nsolidarity in financing for development; how to move \r\nforward with the implementation of the Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy; and how to continue the \r\nreform of the United Nations: all of these are \r\nsubstantive and central questions in the Organization’s \r\nendeavour to maintain its political relevance and its \r\nadded value. \r\n In recent years, we have seen the General \r\nAssembly competing with other organs and feeling \r\nthreatened by the growth in their activities and \r\nfunctions. Sometimes, we have to put ourselves in the \r\nshoes of our partners and ensure that the General \r\nAssembly promotes new debates, such as thematic \r\ndebates in the areas of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, and that it adopts a more \r\ncooperative approach with the Secretariat, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and even the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n We must concern ourselves with our working \r\nmethods. Making the General Assembly more effective \r\ncould mean limiting the length of debates and \r\norganizing a better system of specialized bodies \r\nreporting to the General Assembly. We have to ask \r\nourselves if our working methods and our practices \r\nhave made it less interesting to follow our debates, \r\nwhich some people perceive as monologues. We have \r\nto ask ourselves if we cannot organize more interactive \r\nmeeting formats. \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 12 \r\n \r\n Does the negotiation of certain resolutions only \r\namong interested delegations or through consultation \r\nsystems involving restricted ad hoc groups, even \r\nthough necessary, make us less transparent? Should we \r\nnot have other documents besides resolutions that \r\ntransmit our decisions or reflect public opinion in our \r\ndebates? How many of the 11 most recent resolutions \r\nadopted on the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nare annexed to the General Assembly’s rules for ease of \r\nreference? How can we establish a standing mandate \r\nreview process in order to prevent giving the \r\nimpression of a body that does not follow up on its \r\ndecisions in timely manner? \r\n Those are, very briefly, some of the ideas that my \r\ndelegation believes it is important to raise. We have to \r\ncontinue to stress that we must better organize our \r\nwork. That is the utility of the Working Group that we \r\nhave set up. In this Working Group and in its mandate \r\nmy delegation sees the possibility of working along \r\nthree main lines: first, the strategic function of \r\nprioritizing our work; secondly, the development of a \r\ncooperative approach with other bodies of the United \r\nNations system; and, finally, generating and evaluating \r\nideas on how to make our working methods more \r\nsystematic, how to disseminate them and how to \r\nimprove them. \r\n Peru knows that, with the United Nations, the \r\nexpectations are always greater than the possibilities. If \r\nwe are to enhance its effectiveness, we must put our \r\npolitical will into play and organize ourselves better. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to welcome the \r\nappointment of the representatives of Paraguay and \r\nPoland to facilitate the work of the Working Group. We \r\nwish both of them every success. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation concurs with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement on agenda item 121. We are pleased to \r\nparticipate in this debate on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which is one of the fundamental \r\naspects of United Nations reform. \r\n Mr. President, like your illustrious predecessors, \r\nsuch as Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, whose \r\ncommitment I hail, you are showing your will to work \r\nwith Member States in strengthening the principal \r\ndeliberative organ of the United Nations. You can \r\ncount on the complete availability of the Senegalese \r\ndelegation, which will spare no effort to support you in \r\nthis process. The reformulation of the title of this \r\nprocess, that you proposed in your introductory \r\nremarks — “The role of the General Assembly in \r\nstrengthening the United Nations system” — is \r\nacceptable to my delegation. \r\n The vitality of the General Assembly, as with any \r\nother body or organization, is measured against the \r\nyardstick of its results, compared with its objectives \r\nand the wherewithal it has to discharge its mission. \r\nThus, the issues of revitalization themselves constitute \r\na questioning of the effectiveness of the methods of \r\naction of the General Assembly, the efficiency of the \r\nactions it mandates and the relevance of its working \r\nmethods. Therefore, the exercise that brings us together \r\nis an invitation to introspection without complacency \r\nfor all Member States in order both to identify the \r\nweaknesses and the failings of the General Assembly \r\nand to determine each actor’s share of responsibility, in \r\norder to identify appropriate solutions. \r\n In this regard, the Senegalese delegation joins \r\nprevious speakers in expressing its concern at the delay \r\nin the issuance of the Secretary-General’s report on the \r\nimplementation of resolutions having to do with \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, as \r\nrequested in resolution 61/292 dated 2 August 2007. \r\n With respect to the implementation of \r\nresolutions, my delegation is of the view that that is the \r\nmajor barometer of the effectiveness of our work. In \r\nthis area, it is vital that we — Member States and the \r\nSecretariat — make coordinated efforts, if we want to \r\nprevent the General Assembly from becoming, as one \r\nof our colleagues has ironically defined it, “a body that \r\nadopts resolutions that no one takes into account”. That \r\ndefinition, although somewhat exaggerated, is \r\nsufficiently instructive concerning our method of \r\naction, for let us acknowledge along with its author \r\nthat the percentage of resolutions that are implemented, \r\nincluding those adopted by consensus, remains \r\nludicrous. \r\n Moreover, the case of resolutions 58/126, 58/316, \r\n59/313 and 60/286 — all three having to do with \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly — are all \r\neloquent proof of that. Similar situations that have a \r\nnegative impact on the image of the General Assembly \r\ninvolve Member States as well as the Secretariat and \r\nmerit our particular attention, with a view to possibly \r\nestablishing a mechanism to monitor the \r\nimplementation of resolutions. \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n13 07-61162 \r\n \r\n However, beyond looking for specific solutions \r\nfor implementing the results of our deliberations, we \r\nneed to do more in-depth thinking on our possibilities \r\nfor streamlining resolutions and the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in a constructive spirit while \r\nrespecting the rights of all Member States under the \r\nrules of procedure. Within that framework, the Bureau \r\nof the Assembly, whose role should be strengthened, \r\ncould, following consultations with Member States, \r\nmake recommendations to the Secretary-General in \r\ndeveloping the agenda to adapt it to the challenges of \r\nthe day. \r\n In order to attract attention and to be worthy of \r\nits responsibilities, the General Assembly should \r\nconsider more often topical matters that mobilize \r\ninternational public opinion so that it can make \r\nrecommendations for action to the Secretary-General \r\nand other bodies, funds and programmes of the United \r\nNations, or to Member States, or at least to express its \r\nopinion. It would also be desirable to strengthen \r\ncertain positive initiatives, in particular the holding of \r\nthematic debates and informational meetings with the \r\nSecretary-General, which contribute to the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. It is only \r\nthrough that perspective that the General Assembly \r\nwill have more visibility and enjoy better media \r\ncoverage, notwithstanding the efforts that the \r\nSecretariat should make in this area. \r\n Additionally, a dynamic and proactive Assembly, \r\nfully playing the role given to it by the United Nations \r\nCharter, could contribute to creating conditions for \r\nmore balanced and effective cooperation among the \r\nprincipal organs of the Organization. Along those same \r\nlines, we should consider improving our working \r\nmethods to ensure that Assembly meetings will not \r\ntake place in a half-empty room, as is often the case. \r\n On that subject, it would be appropriate for the \r\nPresident of the Assembly to suggest at the beginning \r\nof each meeting, as is authorized by the rules of \r\nprocedure, a time limit for delegations to speak in \r\norder to allow all Member States to express themselves \r\nwithin a reasonable amount of time. \r\n During the Assembly’s sixty-first session, it was \r\nmy privilege — along with my colleague and friend, \r\nAmbassador Daniele Bodini, Permanent Representative \r\nof San Marino — to be chosen by the President to \r\nconduct consultations with Member States on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. After more than \r\n80 meetings with Permanent Representatives of \r\nMember States, six interactive debates and a number of \r\ninformal meetings, we produced a report that, I believe, \r\ncould be a good basis for the work of our present and \r\nfuture deliberations on this deliberative body, whose \r\nmembership includes all United Nations Member \r\nStates. \r\n My delegation hopes that the open-ended \r\nWorking Group will be rapidly established and allow \r\nus to conduct open, transparent and inclusive \r\ndiscussions in the well-understood interests of all \r\nnations and all peoples represented here. To our \r\ncolleagues, the Permanent Representatives of Poland \r\nand Paraguay, who were appointed by the current \r\nAssembly President to co-chair the Working Group, we \r\nconvey our fervent hopes for complete success in the \r\ndischarge of their exalted mission. \r\n Mr. Álvarez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nwish to offer Uruguay’s gratitude for the excellent \r\nefforts by the Presidents of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-first and sixty-second sessions and also to the \r\nco-facilitators, the Permanent Representatives of San \r\nMarino and Senegal. We wish to congratulate the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Paraguay and Poland, \r\nwho will conduct the work of the open-ended Working \r\nGroup for the sixty-second session. \r\n The General Assembly has a central role to play \r\nas the Organization’s principal deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ. Yet, recent \r\nyears have produced a marked perception of decline in \r\nthe Assembly’s prestige. Among the diagnosed causes \r\nfor that perception are the endless and outdated \r\nagendas, the production of mandates for the Secretariat \r\nthat are sometimes vague or that lack adequate \r\nfinancing, and the excessive application of the \r\nconsensus rule in the Assembly’s decision-making, \r\nwhich has meant that those decisions reflect the \r\nminimum common denominator of different existing \r\nopinions — which in some cases are contradictory — \r\nand reflect as well generalities that are remote from \r\nany commitment or action by the Assembly. \r\n With respect to the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, there is, in our opinion, a confused \r\nperception. The problem does not lie so much in \r\nAssembly reform as in the Assembly’s fully exercising \r\nits powers derived from the Charter, in particular those \r\nrelated to peace and security. For example, the General \r\nAssembly cannot make recommendations in the areas \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 14 \r\n \r\nrelated to Article 12 of the Charter or on those items \r\nunder consideration by and on the agenda of the \r\nSecurity Council. However, it can debate those items, \r\nthe most important aspects on the international agenda, \r\nand in some cases it can reaffirm a decision of the \r\nSecurity Council, legitimizing the decision of that \r\nprinciple organ. \r\n The main thrusts of a revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly must include the following points. \r\n On the rationalization of its work, this must take \r\nplace mainly through reducing the number of items on \r\nthe agenda, beginning with those that everyone knows \r\nhave lost validity and interest. The General Assembly \r\nmust approach in a focused manner the items of \r\ngreatest and most topical interest, including \r\ninternational migration, global health, human rights, \r\nhumanitarian emergencies and the fight against \r\nterrorism. An example of such rationalization can be \r\nfound in the thematic debates that have been \r\ndeveloping during the two most recent Assembly \r\npresidencies. The specific interests of States regarding \r\nan eventual elimination of items from the agenda \r\nwould be given ample consideration in rules 13, 14 and \r\n15 of the Assembly’s rules of procedure. \r\n The operation of the Assembly’s committees \r\nshould be redefined, structuring their work in a manner \r\nthat would permit results-based analysis and improve \r\nthe criteria for assigning mandates to the Secretariat. \r\nThese issues must be studied not from a formalistic or \r\nbureaucratic point of view, but rather from one in \r\nwhich decisions are based on specific requirements for \r\nthe implementation of the mandates, attempting, at the \r\nsame time, to acquire funds for the mandates that are \r\nrelated to the substantive agenda items. We must study \r\nthe structure and operation of the committees, as well \r\nas oversight mechanisms for their work and results. \r\n And the last point, which we feel is very \r\nimportant, is the implementation of the decisions of the \r\nheads of State or Government contained in the 2005 \r\nOutcome Document on the expansion and deepening of \r\nthe relations of the United Nations General Assembly \r\nwith non-governmental organizations. This is with \r\nrespect to the main items that we believe should be \r\nconsidered in a reform. \r\n But, furthermore, we support what was decided in \r\nresolution 61/292 — that is, to assess and reconsider \r\nthe state of implementation of the most relevant \r\nresolutions in order to identify paths that would make \r\nit possible to have a more authoritative, efficient and \r\neffective General Assembly, one that would build on \r\npast achievements. \r\n Uruguay maintains its negotiating position for \r\novercoming the current situation, namely, prioritizing \r\nthe effective implementation of the mass of already \r\napproved resolutions, as well as making progress on \r\nthose that are still pending. We would be in favour of \r\nmeasures that aim to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles \r\nand the duplication of effort, as well as of measures \r\nthat call for a rational use of resources. This would \r\nhelp to achieve action that is more in line with current \r\nneeds of the Organization and its Members. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): At the 2005 World \r\nSummit, Member States reaffirmed their commitment \r\nto strengthening the United Nations with a view to \r\nenhancing its authority and efficiency, as well as its \r\ncapacity to effectively address the full range of \r\nchallenges of our time. \r\n In this regard, the delegation of Kazakhstan \r\ncommends the Secretary-General for his determination \r\nto breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into \r\na strengthened United Nations that is effective, \r\nefficient, coherent and accountable. In our view, the \r\nreform of the United Nations should be geared, first \r\nand foremost, to the consolidation of the international \r\ncommunity in pursuit of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). \r\n We should focus our efforts on enhancing the \r\neffectiveness of our Organization. As members of the \r\ncommunity of nations, we should work to improve the \r\nimage of the United Nations as the bastion of peoples’ \r\nhopes and aspirations. \r\n Recently, I had the chance to meet with some \r\nstudents from a college here in the United States. When \r\nI presented myself as the Permanent Representative of \r\nKazakhstan to the United Nations, many young people \r\nwanted to know more about our activities and \r\nresponsibilities, about our current and future positions. \r\nThis means that the new generation would like to see \r\nus more effective and more responsible. \r\n Kazakhstan believes that a United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly playing a greater role and with \r\nimproved status will promote genuine democracy in \r\ninternational relations. The General Assembly should \r\nhave a central position as the chief deliberative, \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n15 07-61162 \r\n \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Kazakhstan notes certain progress in the efforts to \r\nimprove the Assembly’s efficiency and working \r\nmethods. Yet we believe that this process should not \r\nreplace reforms that are aimed, first and foremost, at \r\nstrengthening the Assembly’s authority. The delegation \r\nof Kazakhstan commends the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-first session, Her Excellency \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her efforts to \r\nincrease the visibility of the Assembly and for holding \r\nfour informal thematic debates on partnerships towards \r\nachieving the MDGs: taking stock, moving forward; \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women; \r\ncivilizations and the challenge for peace: obstacles and \r\nopportunities; and climate change as a global \r\nchallenge — all which offered the Members States \r\nexcellent opportunities to debate some of the most \r\npressing challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n We would also like to commend the two \r\nfacilitators Ambassador Badji, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Senegal, and Ambassador Bodini, the \r\nPermanent Representative of San Marino, for their \r\ntireless efforts in leading consultations on this issue. \r\nWe also note resolution 61/292 on revitalizing the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly and \r\nstrengthening its performance. \r\n As the reports of the two facilitators indicates, all \r\nMember States have a strong desire to revitalize the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to strengthen its efficiency. We \r\nbelieve that it is very important to continue our work \r\nand to implement all General Assembly resolutions on \r\nits revitalization. \r\n Kazakhstan expresses its strong support for the \r\nsuggestion of more dialogue and less monologue, as \r\nwell as the idea to convene debates on important \r\nthemes such as climate change, the MDGs, counter-\r\nterrorism, management reform, Security Council \r\nreform and others. The idea of establishing the practice \r\nof regular, informal briefings by the Secretary-General \r\nin the General Assembly is also a practice that can \r\nbring us closer to solving important problems. \r\n We hope that a new, updated report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the implementation of resolutions \r\non revitalization will provide a solid basis for our \r\nfurther deliberations on this important issue. \r\nFurthermore, we call on the President of the General \r\nAssembly to establish, in accordance with the \r\nresolution 61/292, the ad hoc working group on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n We sincerely hope that under this Presidency we \r\nwill be able to make solid progress on this important \r\nissue and we stand ready to support you, Mr. President, \r\nin your endeavours in this regard. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): For \r\nour delegation, the question on revitalizing the work \r\nthe General Assembly is of high priority. This issue is \r\nalso important for the Non-Aligned Movement, whose \r\nstatement Belarus supports. \r\n During the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly, we adopted a resolution on strengthening \r\nthe Assembly’s role and authority. Unlike previous \r\nresolutions, this document is procedural. \r\nUnfortunately, during the negotiating process on the \r\ndraft resolution, a number of clear and substantive \r\nproposals — which could have strengthened the central \r\nrole of the General Assembly in developing significant \r\ndecisions on issues on the international agenda — were \r\nblocked. We are convinced that a draft resolution on \r\nrevitalizing the work of the Assembly with greater \r\npractical content would meet, to a greater extent, the \r\ninterests of Member States. \r\n We believe that the consultation process and \r\nrevitalizing the work of the Assembly must be put back \r\non a constructive track. The delegation of Belarus is \r\nconcerned about the delay in the issuance by the \r\nSecretary-General, for the consideration of Member \r\nStates, of updated data to his report on the \r\nimplementation of resolutions on the revitalization of \r\nthe work of the Assembly. This data was called for in \r\nresolution 61/292 and our delegation had expected it \r\nahead of time, before today’s meeting of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n A key element of resolution 61/292 is the \r\nestablishment, at the sixty-second session, of a working \r\ngroup to analyse the implementation of Assembly \r\ndecisions, the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nand the making the relevant recommendations. We \r\nintend to actively participate in the work of that group. \r\nOur own independent, preliminary analysis of the \r\nstatus of the implementation of decisions regarding the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the Assembly has \r\nidentified a number of important provisions that are not \r\nbeing fully implemented or are not being implemented \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 16 \r\n \r\nat all. It is our intent to share these conclusions with \r\nthe group. \r\n Moreover, we hope that a survey of the extent of \r\nimplementation of resolutions on the revitalization of \r\nthe work of the Assembly will proceed expeditiously \r\nand be used above all to develop new proposals to be \r\nenshrined in the new resolution with a view to their \r\nsubsequent effective implementation. We also believe \r\nthat repetitive language should be used sparingly and \r\nwith clear justification of its relevance by the author. \r\n In selecting a format for the negotiation process, \r\nwe believe that we must take into account the positives \r\nand negatives of negotiating methods used in prior \r\nsessions, in particular the sixty-first session. The \r\nBelarus delegation calls for transparent consultations \r\nand for the opportunity to be made available to all \r\ninterested States Members of the United Nations to \r\nparticipate in all phases. \r\n In our view, a starting point and basis for the \r\nforthcoming work on a resolution could be the \r\nfollowing provisions, which were approved in prior \r\nconsultations and which, in our view, enjoy significant \r\nsupport from a large number of delegations. \r\n First, we need to enhance the role of the General \r\nAssembly in resolving issues relating to international \r\npeace and security, in particular by broadening \r\nopportunities for United Nations Member States to \r\nconvene special emergency sessions of the General \r\nAssembly. The Security Council should adopt the \r\npractice of preparing periodic analytical reports on \r\ntopical issues on the international agenda for \r\nconsideration by the General Assembly. A big step \r\nforward would be the strengthening of the principle of \r\nequitable regional rotation in the selection of the \r\nSecretary-General. Introducing a cogent and \r\ntransparent rule of regional rotation would help to \r\nenhance the atmosphere of trust between Member \r\nStates and allay the unnecessary tension that, \r\nunfortunately, is sometimes inherent in the process of \r\nelecting the head of the Secretariat. \r\n The Secretariat must increase the level of media \r\ncoverage of the General Assembly’s activities and \r\nstrike the right balance in publicizing the work of the \r\nUnited Nations principal organs. This year, thanks to \r\nthe Presidents of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nand sixty-second sessions, we have had very \r\ninteresting debates on topical issues on the \r\ninternational agenda. Many substantive statements and \r\nproposals have been made from this rostrum that \r\nshould become, via the leading media outlets, part of \r\nthe heritage of broader world public opinion. \r\n We believe that we also need to rationalize the \r\nwork of the Main Committees of the General Assembly \r\nby reducing the time for the consideration of issues \r\ninscribed on a number of agenda items. Introducing \r\nsuch an element of discipline would lead to the more \r\neffective use both of delegations’ working time and of \r\nthe resources devoted to conference servicing. \r\n A further step towards the more effective use of \r\ntime could be the introduction by the General \r\nAssembly of an opportunity for interested States to \r\nmake brief oral statements, supplemented by the \r\ndistribution in the Hall of longer written statements on \r\nvarious issues. The verbatim and summary records \r\nwould, of course, include the full versions of each \r\nstatement. In our opinion, that would ultimately help to \r\nreflect the positions of States on agenda items, while \r\nreducing the resources used by conference services. \r\n Our delegation is convinced that the President of \r\nthe General Assembly should be provided with the \r\nsame protocol services as the Secretary-General, \r\nincluding when the President visits United Nations \r\nMember States. That would allow us, not in words but \r\nin deeds, to demonstrate the lofty and unique status of \r\nthe General Assembly. It is also important to enhance \r\nthe role of the Assembly’s Vice-Presidents in its work \r\nby increasing their practical participation in \r\ncoordinating consultations on the most important and \r\ncomplex issues on the agenda. \r\n Finally, we feel that we should revert to an issue \r\nthat was actively discussed among the regional groups \r\nat the last session. In our view, the General Assembly \r\nmust restore fair regional representation in the General \r\nCommittee. A practical model for a decision on that \r\ntopic could be developed in consultations on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Republic of Yemen, I \r\nshould like to extend our thanks and gratitude to you, \r\nSir, for your leadership of this important meeting. I \r\nalso thank the former President of the General \r\nAssembly, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \r\nefforts in the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly. I wish her success in all her future \r\nendeavours. \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n17 07-61162 \r\n \r\n I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the \r\ntwo facilitators, the Permanent Representatives of San \r\nMarino and Senegal, for their excellent efforts in \r\nguiding the consultations of the sixty-first session of \r\nthe General Assembly, which were occasionally very \r\ncomplex. We further welcome the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Poland and Uruguay, who will \r\nconduct the consultations on this difficult task at the \r\ncurrent session. \r\n My delegation also supports the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Algeria on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Yemen has followed with great interest the \r\nquestion of the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nover the past few sessions. Today, we are debating the \r\nitem because of the General Assembly’s pivotal role as \r\nthe main deliberative body of the United Nations, in \r\nwhich all Member States are represented on an equal \r\nfooting and policies are developed and debates \r\nconvened. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is \r\naimed at strengthening its authority and role and \r\nenabling it to assume its responsibilities and \r\ncompetences in accordance with the Charter. It would \r\nalso limit the encroachment by the Security Council on \r\nthe General Assembly’s purview. We feel that the \r\nCouncil’s gradual encroachment on the Assembly’s \r\ncompetencies has generated increasing tension and \r\ndisharmony between the two organs and will \r\neventually lead to paralysis of the Assembly, which in \r\nturn would prevent it from playing its role and \r\ndischarging its responsibilities and mandates according \r\nto the Charter. \r\n We therefore feel that the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly must be a priority in the \r\ncomprehensive reform process, allowing it to succeed \r\nin its role. It would also require us to eliminate \r\nredundancy, duplication and the discussion of the same \r\nitem in more than one body of the United Nations, and \r\nwould permit the Assembly to focus on issues to the \r\ntangible benefit of all the peoples of the world. \r\n My delegation stresses the importance of \r\nestablishing an ad hoc working group, pursuant to \r\nparagraph 2 of resolution 61/292, on the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly, open to all Member States, to \r\nevaluate and assess the status of implementation of \r\nrelevant resolutions, to identify ways to further \r\nenhance the role, authority, effectiveness and efficiency \r\nof the Assembly. We also call for an accelerated report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the status of the \r\nimplementation of the resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly in the aforementioned resolution. Such \r\nreports should be issued early enough to allow us \r\nsufficient time to discuss them in the Main Committees \r\nor in plenary. \r\n We are concerned that the work of the Council is \r\nbeing stymied by the excessive use of the right of veto, \r\nwhich prevents the Council from assuming its main \r\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. We therefore feel that the General Assembly \r\nhas an important role to play in strengthening \r\ninternational peace and security when the Security \r\nCouncil fails to do so, particularly given the fact that \r\nall Member States are represented without exception in \r\nthis organ and that no select few are endowed with \r\nadditional privileges. \r\n We should therefore acknowledge the focal role \r\nof the General Assembly in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, since such a role is not \r\nthe exclusive purview of the Security Council. This is a \r\nmatter for all Member States, and it should not be \r\nreserved for a select few where differences among \r\nthem, when they occur, often obstruct the passing of \r\nappropriate resolutions. Yemen realizes the important \r\nrole of the General Assembly in selecting and \r\nappointing the Secretary-General, and we support the \r\nAssembly’s efforts in this respect. We stress that the \r\nselection of the Secretary-General must be done in a \r\nmore transparent and inclusive manner and must \r\ninvolve all Member States in accordance with the \r\nCharter. \r\n The strengthening of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly means that we are \r\nstrengthening the authority of the General Assembly. \r\nThe Assembly President will not be able to undertake \r\nhis role as facilitator if we fail to allow the Office to \r\nhave sufficient and qualified human resources. We \r\nwelcome the periodic meetings with the Presidents of \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, and we call for those meetings to continue so \r\nthat more coordination is achieved among the \r\nprogrammes of all three bodies. That would encourage \r\ntheir cooperation to become complementary, improving \r\nthe performance and increasing the credibility and the \r\nrole of the Organization. \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 18 \r\n \r\n Mr. Wolff (United States of America): I \r\nappreciate the opportunity to speak on this important \r\nissue today, although I note the sparse attendance in the \r\nHall, which I hope does not reflect either a lack of \r\ninterest or any sense of futility regarding this subject \r\nmatter. \r\n At the outset, I would like to recall the \r\nconclusions drawn by the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. The \r\nPanel noted that the General Assembly’s capacity \r\n “is often squandered on debates about minutiae or \r\nthematic topics outpaced by real-world events. Its \r\ninability to reach closure on issues undermines its \r\nrelevance. An unwieldy and static agenda leads to \r\nrepetitive debates”. (A/59/565, para. 241) \r\nUnfortunately, in our view, these obvious shortcomings \r\nare now threatening to undermine the very process of \r\nAssembly reform; indeed, the agenda item under \r\nconsideration is at risk of falling victim to the very \r\nsame deficiencies it seeks to rectify. \r\n Prior debates on General Assembly reform have \r\nproduced valuable and insightful, if modest, \r\nrecommendations, including those put forward by the \r\nCo-Chairs at the sixty-first session, Ambassadors \r\nBodini and Badji. However, few of those \r\nrecommendations have been able to alter significantly \r\nthe prevailing “business as usual” mind-set. In the past \r\nfew weeks alone, we have witnessed the passage of \r\nmany resolutions whose texts have not been \r\nsignificantly revised in decades, contributing to an \r\nincreased perception of the Assembly’s irrelevance. \r\nThis dangerous slide towards irrelevance is displayed, \r\nfor instance, in the stark contrast between the static and \r\nunbalanced resolutions on the situation in Palestine and \r\nthe reinvigorated effort to achieve tangible progress on \r\nthe ground. Some of the most vocal proponents of \r\nthese outdated resolutions are the same countries \r\ninvolved in the very effort underway this week to \r\nlaunch a process at Annapolis that we hope will lead to \r\na permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace. \r\n We have also recently witnessed renewed interest \r\nin the reform of other United Nations organs, including \r\nthe Security Council. As President Kerim noted in his \r\nconcluding statement on 14 November (see \r\nA/62/PV.51), one of the seven pillars of Security \r\nCouncil reform is the necessity of reforming the \r\ngreater United Nations system. Clearly, meaningful \r\nreform of the United Nations system must include \r\nmeaningful reform of the General Assembly, including \r\nin areas such as the financing of and decision-making \r\nby the Organization. \r\n The convening of the current session’s ad hoc \r\nworking group represents a new opportunity for \r\nMember States to reinvigorate their efforts and take \r\nownership of the General Assembly’s effectiveness and \r\ncredibility. The onus of restoring the public’s trust in \r\nthe Assembly’s ability to respond to real-world issues \r\nfalls on our collective shoulders. \r\n How do we accomplish this task? First, we must \r\nbe guided by the mandate of the working group as \r\nestablished in resolution 61/292 — that is, we must \r\nevaluate and assess the status of implementation of \r\nrelevant resolutions on revitalization and identify ways \r\nto further enhance the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the Assembly. Those two proposals are \r\nnot mutually exclusive. In fact, we believe that the best \r\nway to enhance the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the Assembly is by implementing these \r\nrelevant resolutions. \r\n In this regard I would like to highlight several \r\nrecommendations contained in the relevant resolutions \r\nthat seek to reform the General Assembly’s working \r\nmethods. \r\n There is a clear need to rationalize the \r\nAssembly’s programme of work by focusing its efforts \r\non addressing contemporary challenges. We must \r\ndiscard the outdated debates recycled year after year, \r\nwhich are no longer reflective of current realities. \r\n Greater cooperation among the principal organs, \r\nas well as between the General Assembly and its Main \r\nCommittees, will enhance their ability to carry out \r\ntheir competencies, as mandated in the Charter. Greater \r\ncooperation will also help streamline agendas and \r\nreduce wasteful overlap and inter-organ power \r\nstruggles. \r\n Member States should exercise discipline in their \r\nsubmission of draft resolutions in the Assembly. \r\nAdopting resolutions on outdated or obscure topics \r\ndiminishes the credibility of this body, while \r\nselectively recalling language from previous \r\nresolutions weakens their standing. \r\n These recommendations, and numerous others \r\ncontained in resolutions from past sessions, provide \r\nample material for initiating lasting reform. In the \r\nsixty-second session, the working group must take \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n19 07-61162 \r\n \r\nstock of the status of implementation of these \r\nproposals, identifying improvements made and areas in \r\nwhich tangible results remain elusive. The constructive \r\nand painstakingly negotiated proposals contained in \r\nprevious resolutions have already established the path \r\nto revitalization. Now it is our collective responsibility \r\nto follow that path to its logical conclusion: a dynamic \r\nand responsive General Assembly that is capable of \r\nforging consensus on issues of greatest contemporary \r\nimportance. \r\n My delegation looks forward to working closely \r\nwith you, Mr. President, and with our counterparts \r\nfrom other delegations to capitalize on this opportunity \r\nto achieve concrete reform. \r\n Mr. Tarragô (Brazil): It is not an overstatement \r\nto characterize the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly as one of the key systemic issues requiring \r\nattentive consideration and action. Restoring the \r\nvitality of the Assembly demands the strengthening of \r\nthe authority and the role of the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations. It also means organizing and conducting its \r\nwork in a manner consistent with its proper, central \r\nplace in the debate of and the search for solutions to \r\nthe pressing problems of today’s international agenda. \r\n The path towards those goals has been a long one, \r\nbut there has been progress. The conceptual basis of \r\nthe revitalization was clearly laid out in a set of \r\nresolutions adopted in the latest sessions of the \r\nAssembly. Additionally, as indicated in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report of October 2006 (A/61/483), concrete \r\nmeasures have been taken in areas such as, for \r\nexample, the role of the President and the working \r\nmethods of this organ. \r\n It is now time to implement decisions already \r\nagreed upon. One example in the critical area of the \r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly comes to \r\nmind. As recalled in the past, this Assembly is clearly \r\nempowered to discuss issues pertaining to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, \r\nwithout prejudice to the prerogatives of the Security \r\nCouncil. One possible vehicle for this could be the \r\nthematic debates we initiated precisely as a result of \r\nour efforts to revitalize the Assembly. We believe it \r\nwould be fitting for the President of every session to \r\nsuggest an increased number of topics related to \r\ninternational peace and security to be discussed by the \r\nmembership. This exercise would strengthen the \r\nindispensable dialogue between the Security Council \r\nand those on whose behalf it acts. The Council would \r\nbenefit from valuable input offered by delegations, \r\nwhile the Assembly would enhance the participation of \r\nMember States in better-informed decisions that may \r\naffect direct legitimate interests. \r\n Another important aspect of our efforts to \r\nrevitalize the Assembly regards the selection of the \r\nSecretary-General. The discussions held in the sixty-\r\nfirst session were quite useful. We see as significant \r\nthe relevant paragraphs of resolution 60/286. Full \r\ncompliance with the decisions therein will allow the \r\nGeneral Assembly to become more involved in such \r\nselection. When the right time comes, it will be \r\nespecially important that the selection of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral be as inclusive and transparent as possible. \r\nThe Organization will also benefit from serious \r\nconsideration of the invitation extended to the Security \r\nCouncil to update the Assembly on steps it takes in this \r\nregard. \r\n Behind these concrete measures lies the crucial \r\nnotion of checks and balances among the principal \r\nUnited Nations organs. We believe that the United \r\nNations will be strengthened if we manage to set up a \r\nrelationship that is truly complementary and mutually \r\nreinforcing, with proper balance among its organs, in \r\naccordance with the Charter. Clearly, the optimum \r\nfunctioning of the system as envisaged in the Charter \r\nwould be facilitated by meaningful reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. A more representative and \r\ntransparent Council would support a vital and active \r\nGeneral Assembly, just as a revitalized Assembly \r\nwould invigorate its trust in an effective and responsive \r\nCouncil. \r\n These are some key perspectives that Brazil will \r\ntake with it to the Ad Hoc Working Group established \r\nby resolution 61/292. We believe that the Group has a \r\ncontribution to make at this juncture of our work. Its \r\nmain tasks will be to help us implement what has been \r\ndecided and to pursue consideration of ways to further \r\nimprove the work of the General Assembly. \r\n We are interested in moving expeditiously. We \r\nwere reassured by your letter of 8 November and your \r\ncommitment, Sir, to appointing chairs of the Working \r\nGroup, which you have done. We must now resume \r\nfocused work on this key systemic issue, sooner rather \r\nthan later. \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 20 \r\n \r\n On this occasion, I would like to congratulate the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Paraguay and Poland on \r\ntheir designation to conduct consultations in the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group. My delegation is ready to \r\ncooperate with you, Mr. President, and with the \r\nCo-Chairs in the Working Group on moving forward \r\nthis important item on our agenda. \r\n Mr. Hermida Castillo (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation considers this item one of the \r\nmost important on the agenda of the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly, since we are referring \r\nto the principal deliberative policymaking and \r\ndemocratic organ of the United Nations. Revitalization \r\nis an integral part of the comprehensive reform of the \r\nOrganization, with the objective of making it more \r\neffective and efficient. It is a dynamic process, in \r\naccordance with the parameters established in the \r\nCharter, in the 2005 Outcome Document and in the \r\nMillennium Summit. \r\n In order to maintain harmony and the balance \r\nestablished in the Charter, we have to uphold the \r\nfunctions and powers that the Charter gives to the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, mainly to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. To have effective multilateralism, \r\nand in order to maintain the Assembly’s role as the \r\nmain forum for debate and the resolution of global \r\nproblems, we have to respect the jurisdictions \r\nestablished for every organ. \r\n The Security Council, therefore, should not \r\nencroach on the functions of other organs establishing \r\nstandards, legislative texts and even definitions — \r\nquestions that directly concern the functions and \r\npowers of the General Assembly and of the Economic \r\nand Social Council. For the smooth operation of the \r\nAssembly, the United Nations has to have sufficient \r\nresources to comply with and to implement the \r\nprogrammes and activities that have been entrusted to \r\nit through the mandates established by the resolutions \r\nadopted. \r\n We are in agreement with the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and support him with action on the \r\nfive points he has identified as global priorities of our \r\ntime — that is, climate change, financing for \r\ndevelopment, the implementation of the Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy, the follow-up to measures \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals and \r\ninternal reform of the United Nations. However, we \r\nshould add to these five points the role played by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, especially in those cases where the \r\nSecurity Council does not deal with situations that \r\ninvolve crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide \r\nor ceasefires. This means that the Assembly should \r\nadopt the corresponding measures to resolve the matter \r\nwhen the Council does not comply with its primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, as was recommended by the heads \r\nof State and Government at the Havana Summit of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries. \r\n In order to work well, we must have the \r\nnecessary tools, in the same way that delegations, in \r\norder to have an adequate, deep, extensive or \r\ncomprehensive debate, must rely on the documentation \r\npublished by the Secretariat. However, by last Friday \r\nevening we still had not seen the report of the \r\nSecretary-General. Last year this report was published \r\non 2 October. We believe that this situation should not \r\nrecur.  \r\n Other issues that we have seen in this session \r\ninvolve lack of wisdom regarding the number of \r\nmeetings that are assigned to certain items in plenary. \r\nWe have seen in the Journal on many occasions that for \r\na specific item — for example, Security Council \r\nreform — only one or two meetings are scheduled, \r\nwhen four or five are needed. We believe that this \r\ncould be easily resolved if we simply considered the \r\nnumber of meetings that the item warranted at a \r\nprevious session or, if it is a new item, the interest \r\nshown in it by delegations in informal meetings or in \r\nthe cooperation by delegations in the drafting of \r\nreports of the Secretary-General. \r\n In the subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly \r\nand in the functional commissions, five or six meetings \r\nare sometimes scheduled at the same time, making it \r\nimpossible for small or medium-sized delegations to \r\ntake part in all of the meetings for staff reasons. \r\n In the Sixth Committee, there was an overlapping \r\nof meetings with consultations on the Law of the Sea \r\nand Sustainable Fisheries. This runs counter to the \r\nwritten provision in operative paragraph 133 of \r\nresolution 61/222, in which the General Assembly \r\ndecided “to ensure that the consultations are scheduled \r\nin such a way as to avoid overlap with the period \r\nduring which the Sixth Committee is meeting”. \r\n In spite of these small snags that can be easily \r\nresolved by the Secretariat, the process of \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n21 07-61162 \r\n \r\nrevitalization has also had its successes and \r\nachievements with, for example, the establishment of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, with the programming of interactive debates \r\nand items that are chosen for the debates and with the \r\nselection of new dates on which the General Assembly \r\nelects its President, Vice-Presidents and the Chairmen \r\nof the Main Committees. We have thereby strengthened \r\nthe coordination and preparation of work between the \r\nMain Committees and the plenary, as well as the role \r\nof the Bureau. \r\n We are convinced that, with the efforts of all \r\nStates and the necessary political will, the process of \r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly could achieve the \r\nresults desired and strengthen the process of \r\ndemocratizing and reforming the United Nations itself \r\nthat humankind awaits. \r\n Mr. Nguyen Tat Thanh (Viet Nam): On behalf \r\nof the Vietnamese delegation, I wish to express our \r\nhigh appreciation to Ambassador Badji of Senegal and \r\nAmbassador Bodini of San Marino for their dedicated \r\nefforts to the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n My delegation also wants to support the \r\nstatement made earlier by the representative of Algeria \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n For the past 16 years, in order to enable the \r\nUnited Nations to better address global issues and \r\ncontemporary transnational threats, Member States \r\nhave acknowledged the growing importance of \r\nrevitalizing the work of the General Assembly and \r\nhave contributed a fair amount of resources to that end. \r\nMany initiatives and ideas have been introduced and \r\ncommendable efforts have been made. Difficult issues \r\nhave been highlighted and brought into better focus. It \r\nis clear to us all, however, that the result that we want \r\nto achieve is still far ahead. \r\n The World Summit Outcome Document, while \r\nreaffirming the central position of the General \r\nAssembly as the chief deliberative and policymaking \r\nand most representative organ of the United Nations, \r\ncalls for strengthening the relationship between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the other principal organs of the \r\nOrganization to ensure better coordination on topical \r\nissues that require collective action by the United \r\nNations, in accordance with their respective mandates. \r\n Resolution 60/286 underlines the pivotal role of \r\nthe General Assembly on global matters of concern to \r\nthe international community, and at the same time sets \r\nout wide-ranging proposals to improve the role and \r\nauthority of the General Assembly and its working \r\nmethods. \r\n Most recently, Member States have been engaged \r\nin interactive debates and concerted consultations on \r\nthe contemporary work of the General Assembly, and \r\nadopted by consensus resolution 61/292, which again \r\nunderscored the commitments to the revitalization \r\nagenda. In that connection, we are fully convinced that \r\nthe upcoming report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly will \r\nlead us further ahead in that ongoing process. We also \r\nlook forward, Sir, to your leadership and guidance. In \r\nthe meantime, my delegation wishes to share the \r\nfollowing points. \r\n Considering that the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly constitutes one of the most essential \r\nelements of the comprehensive reform process of the \r\nUnited Nations and should therefore be accorded \r\ncontinued priority, my delegation notes with \r\nsatisfaction that many measures have been taken by \r\nMember States and the Secretariat to implement \r\nrelevant provisions of resolutions. Initial improvements \r\nhave been made and should be extended on such \r\ncritical fronts as periodic meetings between the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, and the \r\nholding of thematic debates during the Assembly’s \r\nmain sessions. \r\n On another note, we share the views of many \r\nMember States that much remains to be done to \r\nenhance the role of the General Assembly, its \r\npresidency and its working methods; the selection and \r\nelection process of the Secretary-General; as well as \r\nthe effective implementation of the resolutions adopted \r\nby the General Assembly. Close cooperation and \r\ncoordination between the General Assembly and other \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, other \r\ninternational institutions and civil society, as well as \r\namong the Main Committees and subsidiary bodies of \r\nthe General Assembly, should be further consolidated \r\nin compliance with their respective functions and \r\npowers, thereby maximizing efficiency and avoiding \r\nduplication. \r\n It is also a continued priority to rationalize and \r\nstreamline the agenda of the General Assembly and \r\nreview its mandates, taking into full account the core \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 22 \r\n \r\ninterests and concerns of the larger membership, \r\nespecially the developing countries, in the fields of \r\ninternational peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights. Equally important, due attention should \r\nbe paid to the consolidation of reports with a view to \r\nensuring overall quality and reducing heavy burdens on \r\nMember States, in particular those represented by small \r\ndelegations. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly will \r\nbe strengthened only when the general membership \r\ndisplays the political will and determination to enable \r\nthe General Assembly to discharge its role and \r\nresponsibility as envisaged in the Charter. Our efforts \r\nin that exercise must be guided by the principles of \r\ndemocracy, transparency and accountability. In that \r\nconnection, my delegation believes that a working \r\ngroup on the revitalization of the General Assembly, as \r\ncalled for in resolution 61/292, should be established \r\nwithout delay, and that Member States should engage \r\nin in-depth discussions with an eye to identifying the \r\nappropriate and practical ways to move the \r\nrevitalization process to fruition. \r\n Finally, may I assure you, Sir, of Viet Nam’s \r\ncontinued efforts to work with you and Member States \r\nin that important endeavour. \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): I would like to express my \r\nappreciation to you, Sir, for convening today’s meeting \r\nto discuss one of the most important agenda items, the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\n The General Assembly, as the principal organ of \r\nthe United Nations represented by every Member State \r\nequally, is mandated to take up any question or matter \r\nwithin the scope of the United Nations Charter. The \r\nGeneral Assembly plays a central role in making \r\ndecisions on and implementing United Nations reform. \r\nUnder General Assembly resolutions, we have \r\nestablished the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nHuman Rights Council, and have discussed such other \r\nimportant reform issues as Security Council reform and \r\nmanagement reform. \r\n We must perceive the revitalization and \r\nstrengthening of the General Assembly as a vital issue \r\nthat is geared to strengthening the functioning of the \r\nUnited Nations itself. I wish to discuss four points \r\ntoday that I think require priority attention. \r\n First, I would like to encourage Member States to \r\nactively discuss in the General Assembly the most \r\nrelevant and pressing issues of the day. In that respect, \r\nJapan extends its full cooperation and support to your \r\ninitiatives, Sir, to hold major thematic debates and \r\npanel discussions in order to establish broad \r\ninternational understanding of current substantive \r\nissues of importance to Member States and to raise \r\npolitical attention and momentum. In that respect, we \r\ncommend the good discussion at the High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development held in \r\nOctober, under your guidance. The debate on the report \r\nof the Security Council and the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council was also conducted in a \r\nconstructive spirit from 12 to 14 November, with the \r\nparticipation of a large number of Member States. It \r\nhas contributed to raising political momentum for the \r\nforthcoming intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform, under your leadership, and to \r\nproducing concrete results during the current session. It \r\nwill be another busy year for the General Assembly in \r\n2008. Japan is fully committed to rendering its full \r\nsupport to the Panel’s discussion on climate change to \r\nbe held in February, as well as the meetings on \r\nmanagement reform, counter-terrorism and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are \r\nprepared to actively participate in these meetings. \r\nHowever, thematic debates must be prepared carefully \r\nand well in advance, if they are to be useful and to \r\nachieve their intended objectives. \r\n Secondly, Member States and the United Nations \r\nSecretariat must do their utmost to improve the work of \r\nthe General Assembly and its decisions in order to \r\nmake them more effective and constructive. \r\nRationalizing the General Assembly’s agenda and \r\nstreamlining resolutions will help it to focus its work \r\nmore on priority issues and to ensure that messages \r\nfrom the Assembly are action-oriented. Reducing the \r\nvolume of documents submitted to the Assembly and \r\ncombining some individual reports would help the \r\nAssembly to work more efficiently and effectively. \r\nThese recommendations have been repeated many \r\ntimes in past General Assembly resolutions, but, so far, \r\nthere is no marked improvement. The Secretariat \r\nshould make concerted efforts to reduce the volume \r\nand cost of documentation. \r\n Thirdly, in order to improve coordination among \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations, consultation \r\namong the leaders of those bodies — namely, the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, of the Security \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n23 07-61162 \r\n \r\nCouncil, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecretary-General himself, should be strengthened. We \r\nacknowledge the special efforts that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is making in this regard. We fully support the \r\npractice that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon initiated \r\nto provide timely briefings to the General Assembly \r\nand to submit reports to it, if necessary, on specific \r\nissues. We also welcome the holding of regular \r\nmeetings between the President of the Security Council \r\nand the President of the General Assembly to \r\nencourage consideration of issues of current \r\ninternational concern by the Assembly. Close working \r\nrelations among the principal organs should be \r\nencouraged as a regular and continuous process. \r\n My fourth point is on the implementation of the \r\ndecision itself. I would like to stress the importance of \r\nthe implementation of what has already been agreed by \r\nthe General Assembly. Meaningful revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is possible through the timely and \r\neffective implementation of the decisions and measures \r\nadopted. Implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolutions is critical to enhancing its credibility. At the \r\nsame time, messages and requests by the General \r\nAssembly must be clear and precise for effective \r\nimplementation. Mandates emerging from resolutions \r\nby the General Assembly should not be out-of-date or \r\nduplicated, nor should they contradict each other. \r\nMandates should be revised regularly and streamlined \r\nto meet current requirements. Therefore, it is important \r\nthat Member States agree to give fresh impetus to a \r\ncommittee on mandate review under the \r\nco-chairmanship of Ambassador Kaire Munionganda \r\nMbuende of Namibia and Ambassador Rosemary \r\nBanks of New Zealand. An ad hoc working group on \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly is also \r\nimportant in order to evaluate and assess the status of \r\nthe implementation of relevant resolutions. \r\n Japan looks forward to constructive discussion on \r\nthis important agenda and to the achievement of \r\nconcrete results in the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Mr. President, \r\nthe topic under consideration today must be a priority \r\nissue for any President of the General Assembly. \r\nStrengthening the body over which you preside is both \r\nan obvious goal and a political necessity. \r\n There is no doubt that the Assembly has, for a \r\nwhile now, not been playing the role foreseen for it \r\nunder the United Nations Charter. This is a worrisome \r\ndevelopment, because a one-sided focus on the work of \r\nthe Security Council is politically unhealthy and a \r\nthreat to the institutional balance of this Organization. \r\n We continue to see limited value in the now \r\nalmost traditional exercise of negotiating some sort of \r\ncomprehensive resolution on how to revitalize the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The recent past, in particular, has \r\nmade it quite clear that these efforts may produce some \r\nsmall political sparks and can also result in the \r\nconsensual adoption of decisions and resolutions. They \r\ndo not, however, bring about real political change. This \r\nis, in fact, not surprising. Why would a paradigm shift \r\nbe created through an exercise that is, by and large, an \r\nexpression of business-as-usual and thus of the \r\npolitical culture it is intended to change? Furthermore, \r\nthe ad hoc committees and working groups mandated \r\nwith the work on revitalization tend to produce texts of \r\nuncanny similarity and often lead to a repetition of the \r\nwell-known statement that the problem of revitalizing \r\nthe General Assembly is one of implementation or, \r\nmore concretely, the lack thereof. \r\n We do, of course, welcome the appointment this \r\nmorning of our two colleagues from Poland and \r\nParaguay, and we thank them for their willingness to \r\ntake on this difficult task. Our suggestion would be that \r\nthey should focus their work on perhaps just one aspect \r\nof revitalizing the General Assembly. \r\n One key lesson from the past, to our mind, is the \r\nimportance of leadership. This Assembly has been a \r\npolitically more relevant body when headed by \r\nsomebody who was willing to lead its activities and to \r\ngive real guidance to the membership, on the basis, of \r\ncourse, of extensive consultations. Given the \r\nimportance of the position of the President of the \r\nAssembly, it is quite remarkable that we do not pay \r\nmore attention to the process of nominating and \r\nselecting our Presidents. It is clear, Mr. President, that \r\nnot all of your predecessors knew this Organization as \r\nwell as you do. In some instances, a newly elected \r\nPresident, after taking the helm of the Assembly, was \r\nquite surprised to find out what the position actually \r\nentailed. The presidency is not a protocol function; it is \r\na position of leadership and political responsibility. We \r\nwould, therefore, welcome consultations, under your \r\noverall guidance, conducted by the two co-Chairs, on \r\nhow to improve the mechanisms through which the \r\nAssembly nominates and appoints its Presidents. There \r\nare a number of proposals from the past that we can \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 24 \r\n \r\nbuild on, relating to measures such as informal \r\nmeetings with persons who have an interest in the \r\nposition, through regional groups or otherwise, \r\ncompilation of briefing material, and other means that \r\ncan be drawn upon. If a concrete product on this issue \r\nwas to be the only outcome under this item, we would \r\nconsider it to be a good result. \r\n In addition, of course, we wish to see a dynamic \r\nsession of the Assembly under your leadership. We \r\nencourage you in particular to focus on the priority \r\nissues that you have outlined and to make frequent use \r\nof the format of informal plenary sessions. Such \r\nmeetings might be even more useful and yield even \r\nmore concrete results, if you present the members with \r\na list of topics and questions that you wish them to \r\naddress in connection with a particular issue. We also \r\nwelcome briefings offered by the Secretary-General, \r\nsuch as the one given last week. We concur that such \r\nbriefings should be held on specific opportunities, but \r\nwe do not believe that these should arise exclusively in \r\nconnection with travel activities. Also, we would \r\nwelcome briefings that are more focused and limited to \r\na small number of topics, perhaps even a single one. \r\nWe also encourage you to organize similar \r\nopportunities with other high officials of the \r\nSecretariat, such as Under-Secretaries-General. Under-\r\nSecretaries-General, in particular, often complain about \r\nthe lack of opportunity to engage with the membership, \r\nand informal plenary meetings are one obvious remedy. \r\n Mr. Pokhrel (Nepal): On behalf of the delegation \r\nof Nepal, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this \r\nimportant agenda item, on the revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly. In this regard, we \r\ncommend your opening statement, Mr. President, and \r\npledge Nepal’s support in your endeavours in this \r\nregard. My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.  \r\n We appreciate the call of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for a stronger United Nations for a better \r\nworld. We cannot envisage a stronger United Nations \r\nwithout a strong and effective General Assembly. \r\nTherefore, the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nis an important and unfinished item on the agenda of \r\nUnited Nations reform. \r\n The General Assembly is the highest \r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations. Its universal \r\nmembership makes it the most authoritative \r\npolicymaking organ of the United Nations. It is a \r\nmatter of utmost priority for the membership of the \r\nUnited Nations that the General Assembly strengthen \r\nits deliberative, legislative and decision-making \r\nfunctions. Unless we strengthen these aspects, the \r\nGeneral Assembly cannot be revitalized.  \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, world leaders called \r\nfor revitalizing and strengthening the General \r\nAssembly; it is sad, however, that we have not been \r\nable to move forward in the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Today, its functions are being \r\nencroached upon by other organs of the United Nations \r\nand taken over by bodies outside the Organization. \r\nParticularly worrisome is the increasing role of the \r\nSecurity Council in adopting resolutions of legislative \r\nnature, which would have otherwise required \r\nconsideration by the General Assembly.  \r\n Revitalization of the Assembly can be achieved if \r\nwe bring important subjects under its consideration. \r\nFor example, the recent high-level event on climate \r\nchange convened by the Secretary-General showed \r\nhow much the Assembly can do to focus upon the \r\nworld’s most pressing issues. More such thematic \r\ndebates on topical issues should be regularly convened \r\nin the Assembly.  \r\n Nepal supports the strengthening of the role of \r\nthe Office of the President of the General Assembly \r\nand a more regular and institutionalized mechanism for \r\nconsultations between the President and the heads of \r\nother organs of the United Nations. The President’s \r\nOffice should be backed with more resources.  \r\n We emphasize that we should strengthen the \r\nmechanism for implementing the decisions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Similarly, we should be able to \r\ndispense with repetitive and obsolete mandates.  \r\n We welcome the continuation of the debate under \r\nthis agenda item with the appointment of facilitators. \r\nNepal pledges to work with other Member States to \r\nstrengthen this important organ of the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Amil (Pakistan): The Pakistan delegation \r\nwould like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening \r\nthis debate on General Assembly revitalization. We \r\nwould like to align ourselves with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) in his capacity as \r\ncoordinator of the NAM working group. Let me take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the representatives of \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n25 07-61162 \r\n \r\nSan Marino and Senegal for their hard work during the \r\nsixty-first session. We welcome your appointment of \r\nthe new co-Chairs, the representatives of Paraguay and \r\nPoland, who will help guide our future work.  \r\n We also look forward to constructively \r\nparticipating in the deliberations on this important \r\nissue at this, the sixty-second session. The result of our \r\ndeliberations should accommodate the interests and \r\nconcerns of all United Nations Member States. We \r\nbelieve that the issue of revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly is a political and not a procedural issue. \r\nWhere divisions persist, our collective efforts should \r\nbe for consensus-building.  \r\n Pakistan remains concerned that the role and \r\neffectiveness of the General Assembly, as clearly \r\nspelled out in the Charter, has been considerably and \r\ncontinually eroded. Furthermore, we continue to urge \r\nfull implementation of the previous General Assembly \r\nresolutions on revitalization. For our work to yield real \r\nresults, our consultations should be conducted in a \r\nmanner that is open and transparent, treating the issues \r\nin a holistic manner.  \r\n Our work at the sixty-first session resulted in \r\nresolution 61/292, which was procedural in nature and \r\nwhich served a two-fold purpose: to request an update \r\nreport from the Secretary-General on the status of \r\nimplementation of resolution 60/286, and to establish \r\nan open-ended working group at the sixty-second \r\nsession. Unfortunately, the requested report has not yet \r\nbeen made available to Member States. Nor has the \r\nSecretariat indicated a date for its release. Our \r\nconsideration of the report will therefore have to take \r\nplace at a later stage, in the framework of the Open-\r\nended Working Group. We would like to here restate \r\nour desire to see a substantive report from the \r\nSecretary-General that is analytical in nature and that \r\naddresses why there has been a lack of implementation \r\non the revitalization of the General Assembly.  \r\n The General Assembly is the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations and must be enabled to play its central role \r\neffectively. In an increasingly globalized and \r\ninterdependent world, multilateralism is not just \r\ndesirable but also necessary. Against such a backdrop, \r\nthe United Nations has a historic opportunity to play a \r\nlead role in world affairs, but it is seemingly failing to \r\ndo so due to a lack of agreed vision among Member \r\nStates. \r\n Revitalization of the Assembly should therefore \r\nnot be treated merely as a procedural issue relating to \r\nrationalization of agendas, curtailment of \r\ndocumentation and improvement of working methods. \r\nTrue revitalization of the General Assembly can occur \r\nonly once the general membership shows the political \r\ndetermination to enable the Assembly to discharge its \r\nprescribed role and responsibility as envisaged by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Equally important is to \r\narrest and reverse the erosion of the role and authority \r\nof the General Assembly, essentially by the Security \r\nCouncil and to a certain extent by the Secretariat.  \r\n For our delegation, the crux of revitalization is \r\nstrengthening the authority and the role of the General \r\nAssembly. Prerequisites for achieving such an outcome \r\nnecessitate, first, full respect for the Assembly’s \r\nCharter role and functions; secondly, an end to the \r\nencroachment by the Security Council on issues within \r\nthe Assembly’s purview; thirdly, a renewed political \r\ncommitment by all Member States to implement the \r\nAssembly’s decisions on a non-selective and non-\r\ndiscriminatory basis; and finally, the provision of \r\nadequate financial resources to implement all mandated \r\nactivities.  \r\n Some further ideas for consideration include the \r\nfollowing. First, the General Assembly should be \r\naccorded a greater review and residuary role in peace \r\nand security, for example by reinvigorating historical \r\nprocedures, such as “Uniting for Peace” (resolution \r\n377 (v)), and addressing “ignored” issues relating to \r\ncomplex crises, including through the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nother functional commissions.  \r\n Secondly, a General Assembly monitoring and \r\nimplementation mechanism could be established to \r\nreview and advise on the implementation of various \r\ndecisions and recommendations adopted by the \r\nAssembly. This mechanism could be linked also to the \r\nmandate review exercise. \r\n Thirdly, we would welcome regular briefings to \r\nthe General Assembly by the Secretary-General. \r\n Fourthly, the General Assembly should carry out \r\ncloser examination of the deliberations and decisions \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n Fifthly, it is clear, we believe, that the General \r\nAssembly’s role in financial and administrative \r\nA/62/PV.56  \r\n \r\n07-61162 26 \r\n \r\nmanagement and oversight over all United Nations \r\ndecisions and expenditures has to be bolstered. \r\n We recognize that a key reason for the erosion of \r\nthe Assembly’s credibility and effectiveness is the \r\nnon-implementation of its resolutions and decisions. \r\nWe have in the past suggested the establishment of \r\nsome form of mechanisms that can monitor the \r\nimplementation of these resolutions. We would like to \r\nurge the membership to further explore this idea. \r\n Last but not least, Pakistan supports efforts to \r\nstrengthen the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly. We continue to recommend that the \r\nSecretary-General brief the President at least, perhaps, \r\nbi-monthly on all activities in the United Nations, \r\nparticularly those of the Security Council. The \r\nPresident should also be authorized to request special \r\nbriefings on any situation or issue by the Presidents of \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, and also by the Secretary-General. We \r\nrecommend greater coordination in this area. In these \r\nendeavours, Pakistan will continue to work \r\nconstructively so that the General Assembly’s role as \r\nthe principal deliberative, policymaking and most \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations is restored. \r\n Mr. Sow (Guinea) (spoke in French): An in-depth \r\nconsideration of the ways and means to strengthen the \r\nrole, authority, effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is a central concern of States \r\nMembers of our Organization. My delegation would \r\nlike to express to you, Mr. President, our deepest \r\nappreciation for having given this item a due place on \r\nthe agenda. \r\n We would like to associate ourselves with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n I would like at the outset to commend the \r\nWorking Group and, in particular, the two Facilitators \r\nfor the sixty-first session, Ambassador Badji of \r\nSenegal and Ambassador Bodini of San Marino, for the \r\nproductive and tireless efforts they made following \r\nMarch 2007 in conducting consultations, which led in \r\nAugust to the consensus adoption of resolution 61/292 \r\non revitalizing the General Assembly. \r\n In spite of the sensitive and complex nature of the \r\nsubject, progress has been made, and my delegation \r\nwelcomes it with interest. We cannot fail to welcome \r\nthe increasingly central role the General Assembly is \r\nplaying in the United Nations reform process and in the \r\nimplementation of decisions stemming from \r\nconferences and summits of heads of State or \r\nGovernment. The result is the strengthening of \r\ncooperation and of balance between the General \r\nAssembly and the other principal organs, the Security \r\nCouncil, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecretariat, on the basis of the mandates that the \r\nCharter confers to each of them. \r\n The holding of major thematic debates promotes \r\ninteraction and agreement among Member States on \r\nmajor or urgent questions of substance or of topicality, \r\ndealing with a wide range of areas, including \r\nprevention and management of crises, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, terrorism, climate change, \r\ndialogue among cultures and religions, and others. \r\n Likewise, the active involvement of \r\nnon-governmental organizations, civil society and the \r\nprivate sector in the process of exchanging ideas \r\nstrengthens the General Assembly as a universal \r\nrepresentative body and the principal deliberative \r\norgan of our Organization. My delegation is also \r\npleased to note the strengthening of cooperation \r\nbetween the General Assembly and national and \r\nregional parliaments, in particular through the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n These positive and encouraging aspects in the \r\nprocess of revitalizing the General Assembly should \r\nnot hide the obstacles and challenges that remain to be \r\novercome so that progress will be irreversible. In this \r\neffort, we should maintain a better balance between the \r\naction of the General Assembly and that of the Security \r\nCouncil, shielding the former from being trampled by \r\nthe latter. Once again, we should call on the Security \r\nCouncil to keep the General Assembly updated and \r\nbetter informed on measures it adopts and periodically \r\nto present reports to the General Assembly for its \r\nconsideration, under Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter, \r\non specialized subjects relating to topical issues of \r\nconcern to the international community. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly also \r\nrequires the strengthening of the Office of its \r\nPresident, as well as the enrichment and consolidation \r\nof its institutional memory. The Assembly must, inter \r\nalia, make available financial and human resources for \r\ncarrying out its most pressing programmes and action \r\nitems. \r\n A/62/PV.56\r\n \r\n27 07-61162 \r\n \r\n With respect to the improvement of the working \r\nmethods of the General Assembly, my delegation \r\nwould hope for steady continued work on reviewing \r\nand streamlining the agendas of the General Assembly \r\nand its Main Committees. The time has come for the \r\nGeneral Committee, as the main adviser to the \r\nAssembly, to be reactivated so that it can make concise \r\nrecommendations on the Assembly’s working methods, \r\nin accordance with resolution 58/316. \r\n All follow-up measures and reform proposals \r\nshould be contemplated and adopted openly, \r\ntransparently and in a results-oriented way, based on \r\nthe Organization’s priority themes and objectives. \r\n In concluding, I would like to emphasize that the \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions is one \r\nof the keys to revitalization. Therefore, I appeal to the \r\nSecretariat to continue, for that purpose, to provide \r\nuseful information on the status of implementation of \r\nresolutions adopted in this area, including by updating \r\nits excellent report (A/61/483) in conformity with the \r\nspirit of resolution 61/292 of 2 August 2007. \r\n I welcome the choice of our colleagues from \r\nPoland and Paraguay as Facilitators of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, and I assure them of our delegation’s \r\ncooperation. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): Mr. President, we \r\nthank you for convening this debate on the orientation \r\nof the entity that best represents the aspirations of the \r\nglobal community of nations. We also express our \r\ngratitude to the Permanent Representatives of Senegal \r\nand San Marino for their important work as Facilitators \r\non revitalizing the role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n My delegation supports efforts at revitalizing the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s role and authority. It associates \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Efforts at revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nshould aim at strengthening its role as the principal \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations. While we appreciate the efforts to \r\nempower the General Assembly and increase its \r\nefficiency, the Assembly can be considered revitalized  \r\nonly when certain fundamental factors are properly \r\naddressed. The implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolutions is one obvious necessity. Strong efforts \r\nneed to be made in that direction. Certainly, there is \r\nneed for the full implementation of all previous \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on revitalization as soon \r\nas possible. \r\n Revitalization also entails the realignment of the \r\ncomplementary relations between the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council in a spirit of \r\npartnership and in full respect of the two organs’ \r\nCharter-mandated responsibilities. A revitalized \r\nGeneral Assembly is also one that demonstrates a \r\ncapacity to address important international issues \r\nproactively. The holding of thematic debates is a \r\nwelcome development. It is also one that enhances \r\nsubstantive dialogue and cooperation with the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in the interest of \r\npromoting synergies. The recently established \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and Human Rights Council \r\nneed support and guidance from a revitalized Assembly \r\nin the fulfilment of their challenging tasks.  \r\n Political will is of the essence, and Member \r\nStates have to demonstrate it tangibly by bringing \r\nabout a strong General Assembly. Indonesia supports \r\nand urges the implementation of previous General \r\nAssembly resolutions on revitalization. We share the \r\nconcern of other delegations that the role of the \r\nAssembly has diminished over the years and that it has \r\nto be restored in line with its Charter mandate. My \r\ndelegation would support a new substantive and \r\ncomprehensive resolution to that effect. \r\n Moving forward, we believe that the Assembly \r\nshould adopt more streamlined and action-oriented \r\nresolutions. We should plan and organize our work in \r\nthe various committees efficiently, including focused \r\ndiscussions. Repetition and overlapping of mandates \r\nshould be avoided. However, rationalization of the \r\nwork should not be forgotten at the expense of \r\nsubstantive matters. \r\n Indonesia reiterates its cooperation and support in \r\nundertaking a comprehensive and meaningful \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n"
