Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. \r\n07-61667 (E) \r\n*0761667* \r\nPresident: Mr. Kerim . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Hannesson \r\n(Iceland), Vice-President, took the Chair.  \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.  \r\n \r\nAgenda item 121 (continued) \r\n \r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly  \r\n \r\n Mr. Romero-Martínez (Honduras) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Like other delegations, my delegation takes \r\nnote of the importance that has been granted to this \r\nissue. For that reason, we welcome the fact that at the \r\nprevious session the President of the General Assembly \r\nincluded the item on the agenda and that this year the \r\nPresident, with his usual intelligence is also granting it \r\ndue priority and interest.  \r\n Honduras believes that the purpose of the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly be to reassert \r\nthe central role of the General Assembly pursuant to its \r\nCharter mandate as the principal deliberative organ for \r\nthe adoption of actions and universal policies for the \r\nbenefit of humanity.  \r\n We agree with other delegations about the lack of \r\na report setting out in a logical manner the progress \r\nattained or indicating a clear direction for Member \r\nStates. But we also wish to underscore that we have \r\nmade some progress. Honduras greatly appreciates the \r\nwork of the Facilitators — the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Senegal and San Marino. We are \r\ncertain that they will continue their work in other \r\nspecific areas, and we look forward to the endeavours \r\nof their successors, the representatives of Poland and \r\nParaguay. \r\n Honduras believes that mandate review is an \r\nimportant goal. The rationalization and unification of \r\nitems and the adoption of coherent policies will make it \r\npossible, above all, to provide a united and universal \r\nresponse that will benefit both our Organization and \r\nour peoples, who sometimes see us as representing \r\ntheir hopes, and as possessing solutions to their most \r\nurgent problems.  \r\n Mandate review could also rationalize the \r\nresources that are currently scattered throughout the \r\nOrganization. We also believe it is necessary to \r\nprioritize and refine our programme of work as well as \r\nto restructure and re-programme the Main Committees \r\nand improve their working methods. \r\n In the past, we have said that the revitalization \r\nprocess must respond to the need to restore a proper \r\nbalance of powers and functions among the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. In our view, it would be fitting to \r\nestablish, perhaps informally, a coordination \r\nmechanism in order to ensure proper communication \r\nwith a broad spirit of interdependence and a strong \r\ndesire to cooperate. The proliferation of resolutions \r\nand the lack, sometimes, of an adequate mechanism to \r\nensure compliance are disturbing. \r\n As a founding country and one of the original \r\nsignatories of the Charter, Honduras will continue to \r\nparticipate in all debates and negotiations designed to \r\nstrengthen our Organization. \r\n As we have often stated in this forum, Honduras \r\naspires to a strong, united Organization that is solidly \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 2 \r\n \r\ncommitted to the issues of the day, that will listen to \r\nthe sometimes painful cries of humankind, and that \r\nwill glimpse with satisfaction the everlasting smiles \r\nand eternal dreams of millions of human beings who \r\nyearn for a world of greater solidarity and sensitivity \r\nand that is filled with peace, justice and equality — a \r\nworld of equality for all, a world that does not exclude \r\nanyone. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): Allow \r\nme first to highlight the leadership of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly and the able manner in which he \r\nis leading our work on the matter under consideration. \r\nLikewise, I would like to express my delegation’s \r\nrecognition to the Permanent Representatives of San \r\nMarino and Senegal for their work as Facilitators for \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly during the \r\nprevious session. Their contributions are an important \r\nstarting point to continue the consideration of the \r\nmatter at this session. Furthermore, my delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n The General Assembly was established as the \r\nsole universal organ of the Organization, with a broad \r\nmandate that includes, inter alia, economic, social, \r\npolitical, and cooperation issues as well as those \r\nrelative to disarmament and the maintenance of peace \r\nand security. The General Assembly has the authority \r\nto discuss any matter in accordance with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and to formulate the \r\nrecommendations it considers appropriate. \r\n As a founding Member of the United Nations, \r\nColombia attaches great importance to the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ \r\nand considers that this process is essential to the \r\nreform and strengthening of the Organization. \r\n The process of revitalization has been long and \r\nslow. Nevertheless, significant progress has been \r\nachieved, such as improvement in the dialogue \r\nbetween the President of the General Assembly and \r\nMember States, the rationalization of the work of the \r\nMain Committees and the convening of thematic \r\ndebates, which have made a positive contribution to the \r\nwork of this body. \r\n In that regard, we believe that greater progress \r\ncan still be achieved in these areas through new \r\nthematic debates and more structured interactive work \r\nbetween the President of the General Assembly and \r\nMember States, which could begin a month in advance \r\nof the start of each session. It is necessary to continue \r\nthe rationalization of the agenda of the Assembly and \r\nthe reduction in the number of items, so that small \r\ndelegations — the majority of delegations represented \r\nhere — can fully carry out their responsibilities and \r\ncover issues of national interest. \r\n Options for turning General Assembly debates \r\ninto real exchanges of ideas, with interaction among \r\nMember States and with the opportunity to offer \r\npositive and constructive comments on the statements \r\nmade, should be explored. There are also several \r\nmatters on which the Assembly’s resolutions could be \r\nshorter and more action-oriented. To that end, the Main \r\nCommittees could improve the organization of their \r\nwork in order to have more focused discussions. \r\n It is also important for the Committees to make a \r\ngreater effort to add value to their deliberations and \r\nresolutions in order to minimize the use of repetitive \r\nlanguage negotiated at previous sessions. In that \r\nrespect, the reports and recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General can play an important role. They \r\nshould focus on recent developments and in \r\nformulating new action-oriented suggestions. The \r\nrecommendations in those reports should be examined \r\nin the light of their contribution to General Assembly \r\nrevitalization. \r\n Furthermore, adequate coordination is also \r\nrequired between the revitalization and mandate review \r\nprocesses, as both are concerned with the General \r\nAssembly agenda. In this regard, it is necessary to have \r\nclarity on the scope of those two processes in order to \r\navoid duplication and achieve better results. \r\n Colombia is concerned with the imbalance that \r\nexists in the relationships between the main bodies of \r\nthe Organization and stresses the need to restore the \r\nbalance stipulated in the United Nations Charter. The \r\nGeneral Assembly should have a more active role in \r\nthe consideration of issues related to peace and \r\nsecurity, in accordance with functions assigned to it. \r\nLikewise, the encroachment on items within its \r\ncompetence by other bodies should be avoided. The \r\nconsideration of issues such as human rights and \r\nhumanitarian law belong exclusively and solely to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The debate on Security Council reform that took \r\nplace in this Hall two weeks ago made it clear that the \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n3 07-61667 \r\n \r\nrelationship and communication between that body and \r\nthe General Assembly must improve. The holding of \r\nperiodic meetings between the Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the Security Council, as well as the presentation of \r\nanalytical reports by the Council to the Assembly are \r\nsome of the ways to reach that goal. It is also necessary \r\nto have more frequent presentations and briefings by \r\nthe Secretary-General to the General Assembly. \r\n The implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolutions is another area where greater efforts are \r\nrequired. A greater commitment by States to implement \r\nthe resolutions adopted by this body is necessary. The \r\npresentation of a report by the Secretary-General on \r\nthe status of implementation would be useful. \r\n In the specific area of the implementation of \r\nresolutions on revitalization, we regret not being able \r\nto refer to the report of the Secretary-General, as it was \r\nnot published in time to be considered in our debate \r\ntoday.  \r\n The revitalization process should also include \r\ngreater participation of the General Assembly in the \r\nelection of its President and of the Secretary-General. \r\nIn the election of the latter, different alternatives could \r\nbe examined. Candidates could be presented a year \r\nbefore the election and Member States could express \r\ntheir preference by casting a ballot, which could be \r\nopen or secret. \r\n My delegation supports the establishment of an \r\nad-hoc working group to continue the consideration of \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly. It is \r\nimportant that during this session tangible results are \r\nachieved and that these are later reflected in a \r\nresolution that includes substantive elements to \r\nadvance the process. \r\n Colombia maintains its commitment to continue \r\ncontributing to the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly in order to strengthen its role and authority. \r\nMy delegation will continue to support efforts to allow \r\nthis body to fully carry out its functions as provided in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. This is the only way \r\nthat we can meet the goals of greater democracy, \r\nrepresentation and effectiveness in the work of our \r\nOrganization. \r\n To conclude, allow me to congratulate and to \r\nexpress the support of my delegation to the \r\nAmbassadors of Paraguay and Poland for their \r\nappointment as facilitators of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): First of all, I want to \r\nthank the President and all of the colleagues who so \r\nkindly mentioned Ambassador Badji and me in today’s \r\nspeeches. I wish at the same time to congratulate the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Poland and Paraguay on \r\ntheir appointment as new Co-Chairs for the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Once again, I wish to mention the importance of \r\nthe reform of the General Assembly in all its aspects. \r\nAfter spending much time — hours — with \r\nAmbassador Badji and many Members, I strongly \r\nbelieve that we are ready for a true reform of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Not only do we have to improve our \r\nworking methods and the election and selection of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and of the \r\nSecretary-General, but, more importantly, our \r\nrelationship with other organs of the United Nations \r\nmust be improved and made more direct. \r\n We must ensure that this Hall is the centre of our \r\nfocus, in all of our speeches on existing issues. We \r\nmust make sure that the General Assembly is at centre \r\nstage in our planning as we programme our responses \r\nand activities in this evolving world. \r\n I take this opportunity again to thank all Member \r\nStates for their support during the time Paul Badji and I \r\nspent as facilitators. I hope from the bottom of my \r\nheart that this year will be the right year for a strong \r\nreform of the Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on the issue. The Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of the \r\nitem on its agenda. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 48 (continued), 116, 117 and 123 \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.15) \r\n \r\n  Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit \r\n \r\n  United Nations reform: measures and proposals \r\n \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 4 \r\n \r\n  Strengthening of the United Nations system  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In connection with agenda \r\nitem 48, members will recall that the report of the \r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/62/89 has \r\nalready been discussed, at the 39th plenary meeting, \r\nheld on 30 October 2007.  \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of \r\nKyrgyzstan to introduce draft resolution A/62/L.15. \r\n Mr. Jeenbaev (Kyrgyzstan): On behalf of more \r\nthan 80 sponsors, I would like to introduce, under item \r\n48 of the agenda of the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, entitled “Integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic, social and related fields”, draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.15, entitled “World Day of Social \r\nJustice”. \r\n Both the World Summit and the twenty-fourth \r\nspecial session of the General Assembly were devoted \r\nto the issues of maintaining global social development \r\nand recognizing the importance of the social \r\nwell-being of all peoples. Achieving those goals has \r\nbeen declared a priority for the twenty-first century. \r\nThe Declaration on Social Progress and Development \r\nproclaimed that  \r\n “Social progress and development shall be \r\nfounded on respect for the dignity and value of \r\nthe human person and shall ensure the promotion \r\nof human rights and social justice”. (resolution \r\n2542 (XXIV), article 2). \r\n Today, the Copenhagen Declaration on Social \r\nDevelopment and its Programme of Action, as well as \r\nthe Millennium Declaration, which encourages global \r\ndialogue on social development, form a basis for social \r\njustice at both the national and the international levels. \r\nAccordingly, there is today consensus on the need to \r\npursue development, and the obligations to eradicate \r\npoverty and establish socially stable and safe societies \r\nhave been set out. \r\n We should note that, during the second half of the \r\nlast century and the beginning of the third millennium, \r\nhumankind has paid steadfast attention to ensuring \r\nsocial rights and the setting of social policy. However, \r\nwe must acknowledge that continued social inequality \r\nin various parts of the world continues to be the basic \r\nobstacle to further development of the human potential; \r\nthat inequality also fails to reflect the gradual \r\ndevelopment of that potential. \r\n For that reason, the world community is \r\nincreasingly aware of the fact that social policy is a \r\nproblem of vital importance that can be solved only \r\nthrough concerted efforts. The responsibility for social \r\ndevelopment therefore lies with countries themselves. \r\nIt cannot be successfully achieved without the \r\ncollective efforts of the international community. \r\nStrengthening international cooperation is of great \r\nimportance for the realization of a socially focused \r\nstrategy, as well as for subsequent actions and \r\ninitiatives. \r\n We are convinced that the General Assembly’s \r\nadoption of this draft resolution will lead to even \r\ngreater attention by the international community to \r\nachieving the goals and resolving the problems set out \r\nin the Millennium Declaration and the Copenhagen \r\nDeclaration and its Programme of Action. Its adoption \r\nwould also be a demonstration of support for the \r\nprinciples of solidarity and tolerance and for the \r\ninterests of all population groups on all continents in \r\nestablishing a world policy of social justice. \r\n On behalf of the Government of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic, I would like to express our deep appreciation \r\nto all Member States that have co-sponsored and \r\nactively supported this draft resolution. I hope, and \r\nfirmly believe, that the General Assembly will adopt \r\nthis document by consensus. \r\n Mr. Lemos Godinho (Portugal): I speak on \r\nbehalf of the European Union (EU). The candidate \r\ncountries Turkey and Croatia, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia, as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Armenia, align themselves \r\nwith this statement. \r\n In September 2005, heads of States and \r\nGovernment gathered at the World Summit to assess \r\nthe implementation of the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits and the \r\nprogress made in implementing the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. They also sought to find additional \r\nmomentum for the achievement of internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n5 07-61667 \r\n \r\n The EU is pleased that, in the years since that \r\nmeeting, there have been achievements in the reform \r\nprocess of the United Nations launched by the World \r\nSummit Outcome. In that regard, we would like to \r\nrefer to the progress made in the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights Council \r\nand the Ad Hoc Committee on Mandate Review, as \r\nwell as the progress made thus far in the areas of \r\nmanagement reform, the adoption of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the \r\nreform of the Economic and Social Council. \r\n The European Union also wishes to commend the \r\norganization of key events and thematic debates during \r\nthe sixty-second session of the General Assembly on \r\nsuch matters as climate change and financing for \r\ndevelopment, as well as the forthcoming specific \r\nmeeting on development and the high-level plenary \r\nmeeting devoted to the follow-up to the outcome of the \r\nspecial session on children. Coupled with other \r\ninformal meetings on equally relevant matters, those \r\nevents will contribute to the revitalization of both the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Organization as a whole, \r\nand to the follow-up of the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields. \r\n Allow me to draw the Assembly’s attention to a \r\nnumber of specific issues. \r\n With regard to the Economic and Social Council, \r\nthe Union is committed to a strengthened Council as \r\nthe central mechanism for system-wide coordination \r\nand the integrated and coordinated implementation of \r\nthe outcomes of, and follow-up to, the major United \r\nNations conferences in the economic, social and related \r\nfields. The adoption of resolution 61/16, on the \r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council, the \r\nsubsequent organization of the Annual Ministerial \r\nReview (AMR) and the launching of the Development \r\nCooperation Forum (DCF) constitute concrete steps \r\ntowards strengthening the Council. As part of that \r\nstrengthening, the European Union also looks forward \r\nto the discussions to be held on the adaptation of the \r\nwork of the Council — including its organization of \r\nwork, agenda and current methods — as per Council \r\ndecision 2006/206. \r\n The EU is also pleased with the adoption of the \r\nmulti-year programme of work for the Annual \r\nMinisterial Review. We look forward to the discussions \r\non the theme of the 2008 AMR, namely, \r\n“Implementing the internationally agreed goals and \r\ncommitments in regard to sustainable development”, as \r\nwell as to future discussions on global public health in \r\n2009. \r\n The AMR not only adds value to the fulfilment \r\nand implementation of the MDGs and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, but is also a \r\ncrucial mechanism to emphasize the Council’s role as \r\nthe policy coordination body of the United Nations \r\nsystem for economic, social and environmental \r\nmatters.  \r\n The European Union is convinced that the \r\ninvolvement of all relevant development actors in the \r\nDCF process provides a unique opportunity to gather a \r\nwide range of inputs for a deepened dialogue and \r\nunderstanding on the international development \r\ncooperation agenda. With regard to the agenda of the \r\nDCF, the European Union considers it important that \r\nthe Forum also addresses issues such as aid \r\narchitecture and the implementation of the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. \r\n As for development, the 2005 Summit \r\nemphasized that it must be based on a truly global \r\npartnership. The European Union would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to reaffirm its strong commitment to \r\nthe MDGs and its continued support for developing \r\ncountries in the implementation of their national \r\ndevelopment strategies through actions on aid volume, \r\naid effectiveness, debt relief, innovative finance \r\nmechanisms, trade and the relevant international \r\ninstitutions. Actions to reach those goals at all levels \r\nshould be undertaken in an integrated way that \r\npromotes efficiencies and reduces duplication and \r\nunnecessary competition. \r\n On that foundation of partnership, the EU has \r\ntaken effective measures to meet its commitments as a \r\ndonor. It has collectively surpassed the 2006 target for \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) of 0.39 per cent \r\nof gross national income (GNI), which was set in 2005 \r\nbefore the World Summit Outcome. Furthermore, the \r\nEU has set new ambitious targets for 2010 and 2015, \r\nincluding new levels for Africa. It is currently \r\nproviding 57 per cent of global ODA, and is committed \r\nto reaching the target of 0.7 per cent of GNI in ODA by \r\n2015. We will continue to make efforts to meet and \r\nexceed our timetables and invite other countries to \r\nfollow suit. \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 6 \r\n \r\n Climate change poses one of the greatest \r\nchallenges in history for humankind. Scientific \r\nevidence judiciously compiled by the Nobel Peace \r\nPrize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange (IPCC) confirms and intensifies previous \r\nwarnings about the magnitude of the challenge. \r\nClimate change is already altering the face of the Earth \r\nand will increasingly become a contributing factor to \r\nenvironmental, economic and security threats, \r\nendangering also the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals that the international community \r\nhas placed at the core of its development efforts. \r\n The scale of the challenge and the urgency of \r\naddressing it call for unprecedented international \r\ncooperation involving all countries in a global effort to \r\nhalt climate change, based on the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities and the respective \r\ncapabilities of countries and with the United Nations \r\nsystem at the centre of that endeavor. In addition to \r\nmitigating the effects of climate change, adaptation is \r\ncrucial. Developing countries, especially the most \r\nvulnerable ones, face new important challenges in \r\nadapting to climate change, which also hampers their \r\nachievement of the MDGs. The United Nations system \r\nhas a key role to play in that respect.  \r\n The European Union therefore welcomes last \r\nweek’s consensus adoption of resolution 62/8, on \r\noverview of United Nations activities relating to \r\nclimate change, and underlines the importance of the \r\nUnited Nations system addressing the issue of climate \r\nchange in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. \r\nFurthermore, the EU would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General for briefing \r\nthe wider membership about his recent trip to South \r\nAmerica and Antarctica and for commenting on the \r\nlatest report of the IPCC, once again sharing with all of \r\nus his views and concerns on climate change. In that \r\nsame spirit, the EU would like to congratulate \r\nAssembly President Kerim for his dynamism in \r\npromoting discussion on climate change. \r\n The European Union has had a leading role in \r\nthis area and is firmly committed to continue to work \r\ntowards growing international consensus on the need to \r\ntake further and stronger actions to tackle the negative \r\neffects of climate change. Next month’s United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference in Bali will be a crucial \r\nmoment to transform into deeds the international \r\npolitical momentum galvanized by the high-level event \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General on 24 September \r\n2007, as well as to advance current negotiations with a \r\nview to agreeing a new multilateral, comprehensive, \r\ncoherent and effective post-2012 regime by 2009. To \r\nthat end, the thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, in Bali, must establish a clear road map \r\ntowards the fifteenth Conference, which is to be held in \r\nCopenhagen in 2009. \r\n The European Union would like to draw attention \r\nto the fact that HIV/AIDS remains a global scourge \r\nthat must be combated at all levels through the scaling \r\nup of prevention, treatment, in particular antiretroviral \r\ntherapy, care and support. In that connection, the \r\ndevelopment and implementation of inclusive country-\r\nled strategies based on the “Three Ones” principle is \r\nkey. Special attention must therefore be paid to \r\ncombating stigma and discrimination and protecting \r\nhuman rights — including those of vulnerable \r\ngroups — as well as sexual and reproductive health \r\nand rights, in particular those of women and young \r\npeople, in accordance with the Programme of Action of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment. In that respect, the European Union \r\nlooks forward to engaging in discussion on the \r\nmodalities for the General Assembly’s comprehensive \r\nreview on HIV/AIDS that will take place in 2008. \r\n As for peace and security — another major topic \r\nof the 2005 World Summit — the European Union \r\nencourages further progress on issues such as security \r\nsector reform; disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration; the role of natural resources in conflicts; \r\nthe rule of law; electoral practices; peacebuilding; \r\ndemocratic governance; the protection of civilians and \r\nreturn of refugees and internally displaced persons; \r\nhumanitarian assistance and development. In that \r\nrespect, we would like to reiterate the unquestionable \r\ninterconnection between development and security. \r\n Finally, with regard to human rights, in \r\ncomplementarity to the action of the General Assembly \r\nand its Third Committee, the European Union hopes \r\nthat all conditions are now in place for efficient and \r\ncredible implementation of the Council’s mandate, as \r\nforeseen in Assembly resolution 60/251. In that regard, \r\nthe EU would like to see an improved and stronger \r\nsystem of special procedures emanating from the \r\nreview of individual mandates that just started during \r\nthe sixth session of the Human Rights Council. \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n7 07-61667 \r\n \r\n The European Union remains committed to the \r\nprinciples and fundamental rights set out in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and looks \r\nforward to the commemoration of its sixtieth \r\nanniversary, in 2008. It is our belief that we should do \r\nso by implementing and mainstreaming human rights \r\nin the work of the Organization, including at the field \r\nlevel, and by counting on and supporting the valuable \r\nwork of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and \r\nher Office. \r\n In conclusion, the European Union is fully \r\ncommitted to fulfilling the principles contained in the \r\nWorld Summit Outcome, whereby development, peace \r\nand security and human rights are interlinked and \r\nmutually reinforcing. \r\n Mrs. Chabau (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement to be \r\nmade on this subject by the representative of Pakistan \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We would also \r\nlike to make some comments on this issue, which is of \r\nparticular importance for developing countries. \r\n We are virtually halfway to the target set for the \r\nachievement of the modest objectives of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, \r\nthe achievement of the Goals is each day further from \r\nbecoming a reality. In accordance with the MDGs, by \r\n2015 we should have reduced the number of people \r\nliving in extreme poverty in developing countries by \r\nhalf. However, while 1.276 billion people were living \r\nin extreme poverty in 1990, that number has grown to \r\n2.5 billion today.  \r\n By 2015, we should reduce the under-5 mortality \r\nrate by two thirds. However, 10.1 million children \r\ncontinue to die before their fifth birthday, mainly as a \r\nresult of preventable causes. Obviously, we will not be \r\nable to achieve that goal.  \r\n We set out to halt HIV/AIDS and to begin to \r\nreduce its spread by 2015. Nevertheless, last year, the \r\nnumber of people who died as a result of that disease \r\nrose to 2.9 million.  \r\n We established the goal of achieving universal \r\nprimary education by 2015. However, 115 million \r\nchildren lack access to primary education. At the \r\ncurrent pace, when will we be able to announce the \r\nachievement of that goal? \r\n We were supposed to guarantee environmental \r\nsustainability by 2015. However, the important goals \r\nthat we agreed upon at Johannesburg in order to \r\nachieve true sustainable development are still far from \r\nbecoming realities. The threat of accelerated global \r\nclimate change is growing, together with that of \r\nenvironmental degradation. Today, the situation is \r\nmuch more serious, the dangers are greater and we \r\nhave much less time left. \r\n The so-called development agenda for the poorest \r\nnations is far from truly being implemented. \r\nDeveloping countries continue to suffer from the \r\nscourge of poverty, a lack of resources and \r\nmarginalization. Their severe economic problems \r\ncontinue to grow, together with armed conflicts, natural \r\ndisasters and the spread of diseases. \r\n While 1 per cent of the world’s richest people \r\ncontrol 40 per cent of its wealth, the poorest 50 per \r\ncent of population has barely 1 per cent. Inequalities \r\ncontinue to grow among and within countries. The rich \r\ncontinue to become richer and the poor to become \r\npoorer. Unfortunately, that trend continues to \r\ncharacterize the current state of international relations, \r\nto the detriment of the full enjoyment of the right to \r\ndevelopment, which remains a pipe dream for the \r\nworld’s poor nations.  \r\n Lasting solutions to the issues addressed in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus — such as official development \r\nassistance (ODA), external debt, direct foreign \r\ninvestment and international trade — also remain \r\nillusory. Despite the promises made, ODA continues to \r\ndecrease and remains significantly below 0.7 per cent. \r\nIn 2006, it accounted for only 0.3 per cent of the gross \r\nnational product of developed countries. \r\n The external debt of developing countries \r\ncontinues to increase. Last year, it reached a staggering \r\n$2.851 trillion.  \r\n Developing countries continue to participate to a \r\nvery small degree in international trade compared with \r\nindustrialized countries. Developing countries, which \r\nhave nearly four fifths of the world’s population, take \r\npart in only one third of international trade. Their \r\nmarginalization in the international market is \r\nincreasing, which is reinforcing the net transfer of \r\nfinancial resources from the South to the North and \r\nconsolidating the unequal distribution of costs and \r\nbenefits resulting from that process. \r\n Paradoxically, each year, more than $1 trillion \r\ncontinues to be invested in military spending and \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 8 \r\n \r\nadditional billions of dollars in advertising. With \r\nscarcely 10 per cent of the total resources currently \r\nused for military spending, we could achieve the \r\nMDGs. Regrettably, the industrialized world seems to \r\nhave overlooked all of this and continues to lack the \r\npolitical will to take historic decisions that would \r\ncorrect the structural inequalities of the international \r\neconomic system, which is completely unsustainable. \r\n Today, it is more necessary than ever before that \r\ndeveloped countries honour the commitments that they \r\nhave made at the major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits in the economic, social and related fields. \r\nThose commitments cannot remain dead letters or mere \r\npolitical slogans aimed at diluting responsibilities or \r\ndelaying their fulfilment. \r\n It is time that the entire international community \r\ngive responsible and in-depth consideration to the \r\nsituation that developing countries continue to endure \r\nas a result of the unjust and unequal world economic \r\norder, which has proved to be unsustainable. Resolving \r\nthe problems that developing countries continue to face \r\nand preserving nature and the human race itself are \r\nissues that concern the entire international community, \r\nwithout distinctions between rich and poor.  \r\n The objectives have been identified. However, if \r\nwe are to be able to attain them, it is vital that \r\ndeveloped countries demonstrate the necessary \r\npolitical will and meet their commitments — an issue \r\nthat undoubtedly remains the key challenge to be \r\novercome. Only then we will be able to guarantee a \r\ntrue and just global partnership for development. \r\n Mr. Edrees (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt \r\nattaches special importance to the integrated and \r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields, \r\nwhich have made major contributions to the agenda for \r\naction on international development based on \r\npartnership, respect and solidarity. \r\n The beginning of the sixty-second session \r\nwitnessed a series of high-level meetings on the \r\nimplementation of those decisions. First was the high-\r\nlevel event on climate change, and it was followed by \r\nthe High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, in preparation for the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha in the second \r\nhalf of 2008. At the same time, negotiations are \r\nongoing in various Committees — particularly the \r\nSecond and Third Committees — on draft resolutions \r\nrelated to various issues in this sphere. \r\n Despite the efforts of the United Nations in the \r\narea of development, many decisions adopted at the \r\nmajor conferences and summits in the economic, social \r\nand related fields have yet to be sufficiently \r\nimplemented. We are closely following efforts to \r\nreview those decisions, including in the following \r\nareas.  \r\n First, developed countries are still not honouring \r\ntheir commitments to provide sufficient financial \r\nresources to United Nations operational activities in \r\nthe area of development. Such activities have seen an \r\never-sharper decline in financing from the programme \r\nbudget through voluntary contributions. This means \r\nthat developed countries are linking financing to their \r\npolitical agendas. That in turn affects the neutrality of \r\nthe United Nations and contradicts relevant General \r\nAssembly resolutions affirming the principles of \r\nnational ownership and sovereignty and rejecting \r\ndouble standards and conditionalities. \r\n Secondly, there is a growing tendency to separate \r\nenvironmental issues, in particular climate change, \r\nfrom issues of sustainable development. In that \r\ncontext, we should be cautious of going too far, as the \r\nimplications of those attempts will be reflected in the \r\nlong-term by widening the gap between the rich and \r\nthe poor, and at the same time will not achieve the \r\ntarget of sustainable development. However, that does \r\nnot affect our full support for efforts to deal with the \r\nchallenges raised by climate change. The developing \r\ncountries, especially the African States, are the lowest \r\nemitters, yet they are the most affected by the impact. \r\nThus, efforts by the General Assembly — supported by \r\nthe Secretary-General — must focus on reaching a \r\nsubstantive and balanced agreement to address the \r\nissue, while taking into account information provided \r\nby international experts on the current situation and its \r\ncauses. The needs of developing countries must also be \r\ntaken into account, including how to enhance their \r\ncapabilities to adapt to the threats emanating from this \r\nphenomenon by providing financing, technology \r\ntransfer and capacity-building. Commitments between \r\ndeveloping and developed countries must be balanced \r\naccording to the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities, burdens and obligations. \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n9 07-61667 \r\n \r\n Mechanisms for the implementation, follow-up \r\nand coordination of these decisions exist within the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, but the political will to achieve them is still \r\nmissing. On the contrary, we are of the view that some \r\nseek to impose those commitments on developing \r\ncountries only, as they are the recipients of assistance \r\nand in order to prevent implementation of the decisions \r\nby the developed countries. \r\n While developed countries choose to ignore their \r\nown human rights situations, they intentionally focus \r\non the same situations in developing countries, while \r\ncalling for enforcement of the rule of law, democracy \r\nand political, economic and social reform at the \r\nnational level, while also ignoring efforts to exert \r\nparallel efforts in international relations, which has \r\nresulted in the absence of good governance at the \r\ninternational level. That situation contributes to \r\nmistrust and division among the general membership \r\nand creates new international situations that go beyond \r\nthe scope of normal international relations and the \r\nagreed procedures for international law. It also leads to \r\ndouble standards in the consideration of issues of \r\ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, thus \r\nthreatening the non-proliferation system and \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n In the economic and social fields, and despite the \r\nend of an era of summits and conferences that extended \r\nover the past ten years and resulted in consensus \r\ndecisions, it is necessary to strengthen the ability of the \r\nUnited Nations to analyse, monitor and follow up \r\ninternational and regional developments, by reforming \r\nthe Department of Economic and Social Affairs and \r\nproviding it with financial resources — as was the case \r\nwith the Department of Political Affairs — in \r\naccordance with the proposed reform plan of the \r\nSecretary-General.  \r\n While expressing our willingness to consider \r\nproposals to support United Nations efforts in the field \r\nof preventive diplomacy, we affirm the need to address \r\nthe issue of transparency and consultation with \r\nMember States. The Department of Economic and \r\nSocial Affairs will also have to share the same support \r\nrequested by the Department of Political Affairs, in \r\naccordance with the 2005 World Summit Outcome, \r\nwhich established a link between security, development \r\nand human rights. \r\n This leads us to the implementation of the \r\noutcomes of summits related to the status of women \r\nand their empowerment. It has become clear that we \r\nhave lost our way in arguing over the establishment of \r\nnew structures and entities without focusing on the true \r\ndevelopmental needs of women and on giving \r\nequitable consideration to their needs — as compared \r\nto those of men — in the fields of education, health \r\ncare and others, respect for their basic human rights in \r\ntheir countries of immigration, their rights under \r\noccupation and their rights as indigenous inhabitants. It \r\nis also necessary to pay attention to the status of the \r\nchild at the international level by prohibiting violence \r\nagainst children and ensuring their rights in education, \r\nhealth care and economic development. \r\n In that context, coordinated and integrated \r\nfollow-up to outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits calls for improvement in the \r\nperformance of the Organization and an increase in the \r\nefficiency of its services in order to make the best use \r\nof available resources. That follow-up would \r\nencourage us to avoid issuing new mandates that could \r\ncontradict the current mandates of existing bodies and \r\nto avoid reviewing mandates related to sensitive \r\npolitical issues that have special importance to specific \r\ncountries. We also need to avoid any attempts to link \r\nthe budget with reform, which will lead us to repeat \r\npast confrontations among the general membership and \r\ndeepen the feelings of mistrust — and now is the time \r\nto put an end to those feelings. \r\n In this context, it is essential to maintain the \r\ncredibility of the General Assembly in dealing with \r\ninternational challenges through faithful and effective \r\nimplementation of its resolutions, and by respecting \r\nwhat has been previously agreed on, including the Rio \r\nand Johannesburg Principles, because focusing on \r\nmedia coverage and convening meetings at different \r\nlevels must be met by coordinated and effective action \r\nfor implementation, otherwise, poor implementation \r\nwill further erode the credibility of international \r\ncollective work in the economic and social fields. The \r\nresulting weak credibility of the international \r\ncollective security system could lead to limiting the \r\nrole of United Nations instead of strengthening it, and I \r\ndo not believe that anyone present in this Hall wishes \r\nto do that. \r\n Mr. Yaroshevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nMy delegation’s statement is on agenda item 117 \r\nentitled, “United Nations reform: measures and \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 10 \r\n \r\nproposals”. The Belarusian delegation welcomes the \r\nmanagement and organizational measures adopted to \r\nimplement reform of the Secretariat and of the United \r\nNations system overall. In 2006 Member States \r\nreceived the report of the Secretary-General on \r\ninvesting in the United Nations for a stronger \r\nOrganization worldwide. The reactions from delegates \r\nled to the majority adoption of resolution 60/260, and \r\nSecretariat reform took a constructive turn. \r\n We emphasize the need to continue efforts to \r\nbroaden opportunities for the participation of suppliers \r\nfrom developing countries and States with transitional \r\neconomies, in United Nations procurement. Reform of \r\nthe procurement system must be aimed at establishing \r\na transparent and balanced mechanism for procurement \r\nactivity and the establishment of truly equal conditions \r\nfor all Member States and economic actors. \r\n The Belarusian delegation notes the progress \r\nachieved in implementing a global project on \r\ninformation technology in the use at Headquarters in \r\nNew York, Vienna, Geneva and Nairobi of the best \r\npractices and technological achievements in the \r\ninterest of Member States. We believe it is valuable to \r\ncontinue efforts to make appropriate use of technology \r\nin all six official languages of the United Nations. We \r\nalso believe it is advisable to continue efforts to \r\nresolve staffing issues in the United Nations Office in \r\nNairobi. It is necessary to adopt urgent measures to fill \r\nvacancies in the language services of the office. The \r\nUnited Nations office on the African continent must \r\noperate effectively, in particular bearing in mind the \r\nvery important agenda of the Organization in Africa. \r\n I wish to take this opportunity to note the absence \r\nof significant progress in the equitable representation \r\nof regional groups among United Nations Secretariat \r\nstaff and management. Here, there are still serious \r\ndivides. One has the feeling that the Western European \r\nand Others Group remains the main supplier of \r\nSecretariat staff, in particular for United Nations \r\nHeadquarters. The most underrepresented region in \r\nSecretariat management has been and remains Eastern \r\nEurope. None of the efforts made by the Group of \r\nEastern European States to broaden their representation \r\nhave been greeted with responsive practical actions to \r\ncorrect the situation. It is a very strange situation, \r\nbearing in mind the high qualifications of specialists \r\nfrom our region. \r\n With regard to system-wide reform, we would \r\nlike to say a few words about institution building as it \r\npertains to the Human Rights Council and the work to \r\nimprove the system-wide coherence of United Nations \r\nefforts in the areas of promoting development, the \r\nenvironment and humanitarian assistance. The \r\ndelegation of Belarus welcomes the beginning and first \r\npositive results of the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, which the General Assembly established. On \r\n16 November, the Third Committee adopted a draft \r\nHuman Rights Council text (A/C.3/62/L.32, as \r\namended) on institution-building and a set of \r\nguidelines regarding mandate-holders in the context of \r\nspecial procedures.  \r\n The Committee also supported Council decisions \r\nregarding country-specific universal periodic reviews. \r\nIn that connection, we have great expectations for our \r\nability to eliminate politicization and double standards \r\nin evaluating the human rights situations of Member \r\nStates. Belarus would like to express its support for the \r\ndecision regarding institution-building as it pertains to \r\nthe Human Rights Council, especially as regards the \r\nestablishment of a mechanism for universal periodic \r\nreview and the streamlining of special procedures.  \r\n As a central element of reform in the system-wide \r\ncoherence of the United Nations in the areas of \r\ndevelopment, the environment and humanitarian \r\nassistance, we believe that there is a need to maintain \r\nthe key role of national Governments in the setting of \r\npriorities for the operational work of the United \r\nNations in a given country. United Nations bodies can \r\nprovide assistance in developing national development \r\npriorities, but they cannot impose them. In the work of \r\nreform, we need to rely on the intergovernmental status \r\nof the United Nations and the principle of \r\nmultilateralism in addressing issues. What is \r\nunacceptable is the concept of a single country, United \r\nNations representative, programme or agency \r\ndetermining the budget. We cannot support the idea of \r\nmerging the operational activities of all bodies into a \r\nsingle United Nations agency. The adoption of such an \r\napproach would result in a diminished informed and \r\nspeedy reaction by a single agency to the needs of \r\nrecipient countries. \r\n Belarus is also concerned about the \r\ndissatisfaction of several delegations with the quality \r\nof the United Nations interactions with the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions and bilateral donors. That has a \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n11 07-61667 \r\n \r\nnegative impact on the predictability and stability of \r\nfinancial flows allocated for development.  \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of Belarus would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to reaffirm its willingness \r\nto participate very actively in the work to develop \r\neffective ways to reform the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Ale Magar (Nepal): Nepal highly \r\nappreciates the importance that the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has given to the effective \r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits, including the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n In the early years of this decade, the international \r\ncommunity has made concrete commitments at various \r\nsummits and conferences to advance socio-economic \r\ndevelopment in the world. In 2000, the Millennium \r\nDeclaration gave us the MDGs. In 2001, the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action was agreed for the world’s least \r\ndeveloped countries. The World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, held in 2002, produced the Johannesburg \r\nPlan of Implementation on sustainable development. In \r\nthe same year, the international community agreed the \r\nMonterrey Consensus on Financing for Development. \r\nIn 2003, the Almaty Programme of Action for \r\nlandlocked developing countries was developed. \r\nSignificantly, those summits and conferences showed \r\nus the way forward in the form of agreed \r\ncommitments, goals and programmes. They also \r\nidentified major principles, including the principles of \r\nglobal partnership and national ownership in the area \r\nof socio-economic development. \r\n At the half-way mark to the target date for \r\nmeeting those commitments, the report card on \r\nachieving them shows mixed progress. While some \r\ncountries have partially made significant strides in \r\nachieving the MDGs, many others, particularly least \r\ndeveloped countries, are still lagging behind in \r\nachieving them. Unless we accelerate our efforts now, \r\nthe achievement of those Goals in the targeted \r\nframework will be a distant reality. We must therefore \r\nbuild on the achievements made thus far and strive to \r\nspeed up their implementation in the days to come. \r\n Nepal attaches great significance to the role of \r\nthe United Nations system in the implementation of the \r\noutcomes of the major summits and conferences to \r\nachieve socio-economic development. We support \r\ngreater engagement by the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil in advancing the socio-economic agenda. We \r\nsupport system-wide coherence and emphasize the \r\nneed for inter-agency coordination in the United \r\nNations system for the successful implementation of \r\nthe development outcomes. We encourage the regional \r\ncommissions and the specialized agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations to enhance their \r\nroles in strengthening country programmes for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Bretton Woods institutions and the World \r\nTrade Organization can be expected to play more \r\neffective roles to implement the outcomes of the major \r\nsummits and conferences in the social, economic and \r\nrelated fields. There is a need to further expand the role \r\nof those institutions and to reorient their actions in \r\nadvancing socio-economic development in the world’s \r\npoorer countries. In particular, their monitoring and \r\nfollow-up mechanisms should be strengthened by \r\nimproving indicators and developing a results-based \r\nmatrix in the implementation of the outcomes of major \r\nsummits and conferences. \r\n The year 2008 will be a defining moment for the \r\ndevelopment agenda. We will be reviewing the \r\nprogress made in the implementation of the MDGs and \r\nthe outcome of the 2002 International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development. In addition, the General \r\nAssembly will be undertaking a mid-term review of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action for landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries. At the twelfth Conference of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \r\nto be held in Accra, we will also be addressing the \r\nchallenges to development posed by globalization. \r\nNepal attaches vital importance to those events and \r\nstresses that they provide renewed opportunities to \r\nfurther accelerate the implementation of our agreed \r\ngoals and commitments in the area of development. \r\n Nepal is committed to integrate the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, \r\ncommitments and programmes into its national policies \r\nand programmes. We have already incorporated many \r\nof them into our national development plan. Our \r\ninterim plan focuses on commitments to people-centred \r\ndevelopment, with a strong emphasis on good \r\ngovernance and poverty reduction. We hope that our \r\ndevelopment partners will provide an enhanced level of \r\nsupport to help us achieve our planned goals and \r\ntargets. \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 12 \r\n \r\n The peace process in Nepal has made significant \r\nstrides since the historic signing, in November 2006, of \r\na comprehensive peace accord between the \r\nGovernment of Nepal and the Communist Party of \r\nNepal (Maoist). We are striving to establish a new \r\nNepal that is committed to the fundamental values of \r\ndemocracy, social justice and people’s progressive \r\ndiscourse.  \r\n The decade-long conflict came to an end with \r\ntangible achievements, such as empowerment of the \r\nmasses and acceptance of a more inclusive and \r\ndemocratic framework for Nepal’s various \r\nmarginalized groups, including women, indigenous \r\npeoples, Madhesis, Dalits and people in the backward \r\nareas. We are now entering the phase of restructuring \r\nthe State through elections to the Constituent \r\nAssembly, in which the elected representatives of the \r\npeople will write their own constitution. Those \r\ndevelopments are vital in creating an atmosphere \r\nconducive to paving way for better implementation of \r\ninternationally agreed goals and commitments in the \r\narea of socio-economic development. \r\n In conclusion, the international community \r\ncannot afford to be an apathetic spectator while \r\nmillions of people in the world continue to languish in \r\ncrippling poverty and exclusion. It has a special \r\nresponsibility to lift them out of that morass. \r\n Relegating poverty to history is possible, and it is \r\nwithin human reach if we act in concert. This solemn \r\npledge cannot be achieved without renewed \r\ninternational political will, the significant scaling up of \r\nresources, sustained policies and programmes and \r\ncommitted national leadership. Together, we can make \r\nit happen. This is the lesson we have learned from \r\nthese summits and conferences. \r\n Along with all members of my delegation, I \r\npersonally feel greatly honoured and privileged to be \r\nattending the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly, although the journey here was a really \r\ndifficult one. I was denied a United States visa about \r\nseven months ago, in spite of having been privileged \r\nenough to receive a written invitation from Under-\r\nSecretary-General Lynn Pascoe to join a team working \r\nto establish the United Nations office to study electoral \r\nsystems and functions. I think that the point of such an \r\naction and tendency on the part of the ruling class of \r\nthe United States is definitely not obvious to people \r\naround the world, who have great respect for them. \r\nThis is what has made people around the world think \r\nabout locating United Nations Headquarters in a \r\nlocation that is easily accessible to all. \r\n Ms. Al-Ghanim (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express, on behalf of the \r\nState of Kuwait, our deep appreciation for all the \r\nefforts made by the Secretary-General in his leadership \r\nof the Organization, efforts that are reflected in the \r\nvarious reports he has submitted for discussion during \r\nthe current session. These reports contain, inter alia, \r\nhis calls for the importance of implementing the \r\nprovisions of the Millennium Declaration and not \r\nallowing it to conclude as a mere memory in the \r\nhistory of the Organization, thus affirming his concern \r\nto carry out his mandate fully. \r\n Economic and social development is at the core \r\nof the goals and activities that the United Nations \r\ncarries out. Achieving the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), should remain within the \r\ncomprehensive framework of United Nations \r\ndevelopment activities. There is also need for the full \r\nimplementation of the commitments agreed upon in all \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields, as well as for \r\nstrengthening the international partnership for \r\ndevelopment, based on the recognition of national \r\nleadership and ownership of the development strategies \r\nof States. \r\n Despite the fact that two years have elapsed since \r\nthe 2005 World Summit, and seven years since the \r\nMillennium Summit, the challenges and dangers facing \r\ninternational peace and security, such as poverty, \r\nhunger, the spread of such dangerous and infectious \r\ndiseases as AIDS and malaria, and the deterioration of \r\nthe environment, are still present and threatening us. \r\nThe first Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing of Development, scheduled to be held in \r\nDoha during the second half of 2008, provides a great \r\nopportunity to assess progress made in achieving the \r\nMDGs. \r\n The State of Kuwait has made good progress in \r\ntranslating the commitments and resolutions of the \r\n2005 World Summit into tangible results, and has also \r\nachieved the MDGs, particularly in the fields of \r\neducation, health and advancing the role of women in \r\nsociety. It has devised policies capable of uplifting \r\nsociety and realizing more social and economic \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n13 07-61667 \r\n \r\nprogress, as well as raising the standard of living per \r\ncapita. \r\n Given our absolute belief in human values and \r\ninternational solidarity, since gaining our \r\nindependence, we have adopted a generous programme \r\nof assistance to developing countries. In 1961, the \r\nKuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development was \r\nestablished making it the second oldest development \r\nfund in the world, after the International Monetary \r\nFund. The Kuwait Fund has financed hundreds of \r\ninfrastructure projects in over 100 countries, valued at \r\nmore than $12 billion, thereby exceeding by more than \r\ndouble the percentage of gross national product (GNP) \r\nslated for development assistance and agreed upon \r\ninternationally. \r\n In this respect, it is incumbent upon developed \r\ncountries to support the economic structures of \r\ndeveloping ones and to adhere to their commitments by \r\nsupplying them with adequate financial and \r\ntechnological assistance in order to reach the level of \r\n0.07 per cent of their GNP as official development \r\nassistance. This aid should be provided within the \r\nframework of supporting the national strategies that the \r\ndeveloping countries themselves have adopted. \r\n Not only is it regrettable to see poverty, hunger \r\nand disease persist in developing countries, but it is \r\nalso painful to see more than half the world’s \r\npopulation live on less than $2 a day. This requires a \r\nserious look at the impediments to development in the \r\ndeveloping countries and a real review of these \r\nimpediments. Here, the State of Kuwait calls upon the \r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions to reduce restrictions imposed on \r\nthe exports of developing countries and to put forth a \r\nmore just and equitable international trade system for \r\nthe poor countries and the least developed ones, as well \r\nas to expand their participation in the decision-making \r\nprocess of the WTO and take into consideration the \r\nconcerns of the poor and least developed countries. \r\n We reiterate our commitment to the efforts being \r\nexerted to reduce the impact of the challenges facing \r\nour world today, particularly those dealing with the \r\nenvironment. The State of Kuwait follows with utmost \r\nconcern the phenomenon of climate change. Despite \r\nconfirmation by all the reports of the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \r\nconcerning the difficulty of relying on one strategy \r\nalone to mitigate the impact of this phenomenon, we \r\nsee that the focus is still centred on reducing the use of \r\nfossil fuel. Other factors resulting from human \r\nbehaviour which pollute the air and cause a more \r\nsevere pattern of climate change are ignored, including \r\ndeforestation, urban expansion at the expense of \r\nagriculture land and the effects of nuclear energy. \r\nThese are the main causes for the accumulation of \r\ngreenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and global \r\nwarming.  \r\n Hopefully, the upcoming meeting in Bali, \r\nIndonesia, of States parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nKyoto Protocol will provide an opportunity to deal \r\nwith this subject in detail. In this context, we would \r\nlike to mention that the State of Kuwait recently \r\ndonated $150 million at the presidential meeting in \r\nRiyadh of OPEC countries on the subject of energy and \r\nclimate research. \r\n The State of Kuwait will remain true to its \r\npromise to provide all the support and aid it can to its \r\nfriends among the countries of the developing world. \r\nThis results from our strong belief in the principle of \r\nsharing, with a view to achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment and a more prosperous and stable life for \r\nall peoples of the world. \r\n Ms. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): This year marks the \r\nmidpoint for efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n While speaking about the achievement of these \r\nGoals, we note success in eliminating poverty and \r\nhunger in many countries. However, we need to \r\ncoordinate multilateral action to achieve the MDGs for \r\nthe creation of an enabling international economic \r\nenvironment to support developing countries’ efforts to \r\nachieve sustained economic growth and development. \r\n Kazakhstan is committed to its obligations to \r\nreach the MDGs and is constantly implementing its \r\nlong-term development strategy, known as \r\n“Kazakhstan 2030”. Our main objective in the area of \r\neconomic policy is to ensure that Kazakhstan joins the \r\nranks of the most competitive economies. To this end, \r\nwe are implementing an industrial and innovative \r\nprogramme to diversify the economy, increase \r\nproduction of value-added goods and services and lay \r\nthe foundation for a high-technology service economy. \r\n It is widely acknowledged that, in order to \r\nachieve the MDGs, additional efforts have to be made \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 14 \r\n \r\nto assure that countries with special needs will make \r\nthe progress necessary under all MDG targets. The \r\nchallenges and constraints of landlocked developing \r\ncountries are enormous. It is recognized that high trade \r\ntransaction costs, influenced by a lack of access to the \r\nsea and remoteness from major markets, represent the \r\nmain cause of marginalization of the landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries. That is why it is very important \r\nto ensure the implementation of the decisions and \r\nrecommendations of major international conferences \r\non trade and development in order for small and \r\nvulnerable economies to finally get a chance to enjoy \r\nthe benefits and advantages promised at those \r\nconferences.  \r\n Kazakhstan believes that social development \r\nissues should continue to be among the priority items \r\nin the agendas of the principal bodies of the United \r\nNations. Social development, the well-being of the \r\npopulation, poverty elimination, education and decent \r\njob creation are key elements for preserving global \r\ncollective security and peace.  \r\n I would therefore like to commend the delegation \r\nof the Kyrgyz Republic for initiating the draft \r\nresolution entitled “World Day of Social Justice” \r\n(A/62/L.15), which was introduced today; Kazakhstan \r\nwill be a sponsor. We believe that the annual \r\ncelebration of the World Day of Social Justice will give \r\nan opportunity to societies and communities at all \r\nlevels to draw attention once again to the importance of \r\nsocial development and the achievement of social \r\njustice around the world.  \r\n The delegation of Kazakhstan would like to \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his commitment to \r\nthe creation of a more transparent and accountable \r\nSecretariat, with the highest levels of efficiency, \r\ncompetence and integrity. We believe that adequate \r\ninstitutional follow-up to the recommendations of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and United Nations oversight bodies \r\nwill transform in a positive manner the human resource \r\nbase of the Organization, enhance its managerial \r\ndecision-making tools and allow for better financial \r\ncontrol, in addition to more accurate and timely \r\nmanagement reporting. The highest standards of \r\nefficiency, competence, and integrity should have the \r\nparamount consideration in the employment of the \r\nstaff, and due regard should also be given to the \r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution, in \r\naccordance with Article 101 of the Charter.  \r\n Our delegation welcomes the measures being \r\nundertaken by the Secretariat to improve the United \r\nNations procurement system. As a new emerging donor \r\ncountry, Kazakhstan is interested in improving \r\nprocurement opportunities for vendors from developing \r\ncountries and countries with economies in transition, \r\nand in diversifying the sources of goods and services. \r\nOver the last decades the competitiveness of the \r\neconomies of these countries has increased \r\nconsiderably. In order to promote procurement \r\nactivities in such countries the United Nations \r\nProcurement Service should periodically update its \r\nfield procurement system, pay increased attention to \r\nthe organization of seminars and training courses for \r\nlocal contractors and distribute information in the mass \r\nmedia in local languages. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/32 of 19 November \r\n2002, I now call on the observer for the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union.  \r\n Mrs. Filip (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I am \r\npleased to address the General Assembly on the agenda \r\nitem on the strengthening of the United Nations \r\nsystem. As we have done during previous sessions of \r\nthe General Assembly, I would like to refer to this \r\ntheme from the perspective of the developing \r\nparliamentary dimension to the work of the United \r\nNations, and the benefits that it entails.  \r\n I would recall that we are referring here to a \r\ndimension that needs to be forged by parliaments and \r\ntheir members, and which has to be firmly rooted in the \r\nactivities that parliaments carry out at the national \r\nlevel at home. It includes action by parliaments to \r\ncontribute to and monitor international negotiations \r\nand debates at the United Nations, and to ensure \r\nnational compliance with international norms and the \r\nrule of law. It also involves scrutinizing the activities \r\nof the United Nations and providing input into their \r\ndeliberations.  \r\n As we have stressed previously, the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is convinced that \r\nmembers of parliament can play an extremely \r\nimportant role in building national political support for \r\ninternational action. In the IPU’s view, which is shared \r\nby many United Nations Member States, the United \r\nNations stands to gain considerably by making sure \r\nthat parliaments and their members have a full and \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n15 07-61667 \r\n \r\nundistorted understanding of major processes and \r\nactivities under way at the United Nations.  \r\n It was with this understanding that, one year ago, \r\nthe General Assembly adopted consensus resolution \r\n61/6 on “Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union”. Since then, we have \r\nbeen focusing on the effective implementation of this \r\nbold and forward-looking resolution.  \r\n As a general recommendation, the resolution \r\nencourages the United Nations and the IPU to continue \r\nto cooperate closely in various fields, in particular \r\npeace and security, economic and social development, \r\ninternational law, human rights, democracy and gender \r\nissues, bearing in mind the significant benefits of \r\ncooperation between the two organizations, to which \r\nthe report of the United Nations Secretary-General \r\nattests.  \r\n It is precisely because of the importance that the \r\nIPU attaches to this growing cooperation that we are \r\ndevoting time and resources in order to ensure careful \r\nconsideration and political guidance of this process. \r\nOne of the measures that the IPU has already taken, \r\ntherefore, has been the establishment of a dedicated \r\nparliamentary committee on United Nations affairs, in \r\nwhich all parliaments can participate and bring their \r\ncontribution to the development of this parliamentary \r\ndimension to the work of the United Nations, and \r\nmonitor its implementation.  \r\n Allow me to recall briefly some of the IPU’s \r\nactivities over this past year in support of \r\nstrengthening the United Nations system, and in \r\nparticular by following up on and implementing the \r\nprovisions of General Assembly resolution 61/6. As a \r\nfirst point, the resolution encouraged the IPU to further \r\nstrengthen its contribution to the work of the General \r\nAssembly, including its revitalization, as envisaged in \r\nthe relevant 2006 and 2007 General Assembly \r\nresolutions, and in relation to the newly established \r\nUnited Nations bodies such as the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission.  \r\n Regarding the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, the IPU has had the opportunity to consult \r\nand engage with United Nations Member States on this \r\nvery important topic. In light of the relevant experience \r\nresiding within national parliaments in the area of \r\nmodernizing and revitalizing legislative bodies, we \r\nhave shared with the General Assembly a series of \r\nideas, proposals and good practices and look forward \r\nto finding the most adequate ways to further contribute \r\nto this process.  \r\n Moreover, last month in Geneva, the IPU’s new \r\nparliamentary Committee on United Nations Affairs \r\nheard from and engaged in a discussion with the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, and will be \r\nseeking to define modalities whereby parliaments can \r\nbest act in support of the Council, particularly in the \r\ncontext of the universal periodic review process. This \r\nwill ensure accurate reporting on the implementation of \r\ninternational human rights instruments and help \r\nidentify those areas where additional efforts are \r\nrequired.  \r\n In respect of the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nIPU has been closely following deliberations and \r\naction as they concern Burundi and Sierra Leone, and \r\nhas been working with parliaments and authorities in \r\nboth countries, with a view to building strong \r\ninternational support for the new legislative bodies as \r\nkey components for sustainable peace and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n As recommended by General Assembly \r\nresolution 61/6, the IPU is also assuming a more active \r\nrole in support of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nparticularly in the implementation of the new functions \r\ndevolved to the Council by the 2005 World Summit. In \r\nthis regard, the IPU has taken the lead in shaping a \r\nparliamentary dimension to the new Development \r\nCooperation Forum (DCF) and, after voicing its \r\ncommitment on the occasion of the launch of the DCF \r\nearlier this year, is now actively preparing for the first \r\nsubstantive session of the Forum next year. \r\n Development cooperation will gradually be \r\nmainstreamed into the IPU’s own regular programme \r\nof work. At the same, the IPU will be convening a \r\nrepresentative group of members of parliament from \r\nboth developed and developing countries, well versed \r\nin development cooperation issues, to participate in \r\nand contribute to the first DCF stakeholders forum next \r\nspring, thus providing direct input to the DCF. As a \r\nmember of the DCF advisory board, the IPU will be \r\nconsulting closely with the United Nations on the \r\nagenda and expected outcome of this meeting.  \r\n In paragraph 6 of resolution 61/6, the General \r\nAssembly welcomed the partnership agreement \r\nconcluded between the United Nations Democracy \r\nFund and the IPU and looked forward to growing \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 16 \r\n \r\ncooperation in the realm of democracy and good \r\ngovernance.  \r\n Indeed, with United Nations Development \r\nAccount funding, the IPU is currently implementing \r\ntwo projects: one is designed to enhance the capacity \r\nof parliaments in Africa to enact and revise national \r\nlegislation so as to ensure compliance with \r\ninternational human rights standards; the other is in \r\nsupport of women parliamentarians in Burundi, which \r\nincludes initiatives aimed at bringing women members \r\nof parliament from all political parties to work together \r\nfor the promotion of women’s rights in Burundi. \r\n In a much broader context, the IPU and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme signed a new \r\nmemorandum of understanding last week designed to \r\nexpand their cooperation in support of democratic \r\ngovernance around the world in key areas such as \r\nnational budget processes, action by parliaments in \r\nadvancing the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), poverty reduction strategies and greater \r\nparliamentarian involvement in development \r\ncooperation. \r\n Last but not least, and as we had the opportunity \r\nto say very recently in this Hall (see A/62/PV.44), the \r\nIPU is proud to be part of a joint effort to promote an \r\ninternational day of democracy on a date which has \r\nbeen chosen to coincide with the anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration on Democracy. The precepts and \r\nprinciples enshrined in that important political \r\ndocument, endorsed 10 years ago by national \r\nparliaments from around the globe, are as valid today \r\nas ever before. We look forward to working closely \r\nwith the United Nations with a view to systematically \r\nintegrating these core values into efforts to strengthen \r\ndemocracy worldwide. \r\n A further recommendation of resolution 61/6 calls \r\nfor the development of the annual parliamentary \r\nhearing at the United Nations and other specialized \r\nparliamentary meetings at the United Nations as joint \r\nUnited Nations-IPU events. Last week the IPU and the \r\nUnited Nations, through the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, joined forces in convening a \r\nvery successful parliamentary hearing on the theme of \r\nreinforcing the rule of law in international relations. \r\nThe meeting attracted great interest from the national \r\nparliaments, which were well-represented. It also drew \r\nin many representatives from permanent missions, as \r\nwell as senior United Nations officials and academia, \r\nfor a substantive, interactive and politically charged \r\ndebate.  \r\n This joint event succeeded in raising awareness \r\namong politicians around issues that are, or should be, \r\nhigh on the agenda of the United Nations, such as \r\nmeeting commitments in the area of disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, strengthening the international \r\ncriminal justice regime and implementing the \r\ninternational global counter-terrorism strategy. The \r\nhearing resulted in a number of recommendations for \r\nthe United Nations, as well as proposals for action by \r\nparliaments in support of United Nations efforts. The \r\nresults of the hearing will be circulated shortly as an \r\nofficial document of the General Assembly. \r\n Finally, General Assembly resolution 61/6 calls \r\nfor closer involvement, as appropriate, of the IPU in \r\nthe elaboration in system-wide strategies for \r\nconsideration by the United Nations system and the \r\nUnited Nations system Chief Executive Board for \r\nCoordination, with a view to ensuring greater and more \r\ncoherent support by parliaments to the work for the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n We have yet to determine the best ways to make \r\nthis recommendation operational. However, it is \r\nevident to us that there are a number of areas that can \r\nallow for meaningful and mutually beneficial \r\nexchanges, such as delivering on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, mobilizing political action in \r\ncombating climate change and institutional gender \r\nmainstreaming, to name a few. \r\n The IPU remains committed to further developing \r\na strategic partnership with the United Nations. In so \r\ndoing, we are guided by the considerations and \r\nproposals set forward in the IPU policy paper on the \r\nnature of the relationship between the United Nations \r\nand the world of parliaments, submitted for \r\nconsideration in the IPU Committee on United Nations \r\nAffairs and endorsed by IPU member parliaments on \r\nthe occasion of the IPU’s 117th Assembly, held in early \r\nOctober. This document has been submitted to the \r\nUnited Nations and should soon be circulated in the \r\nGeneral Assembly as our further contribution to this \r\nagenda item. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/62/L.15, entitled \r\n“World Day of Social Justice”. Before proceeding to \r\ntake action on the draft resolution, I would like to \r\nannounce that since its introduction, the following \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n17 07-61667 \r\n \r\ncountries have become sponsors of draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.15: Brazil, Cyprus, Montenegro, Oman, the \r\nPhilippines and Thailand.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\nthe draft resolution? \r\n Draft resolution A/62/L.15 was adopted \r\n(resolution 62/10). \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda items 48, 116, 117 and 123. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 13  \r\n \r\nThe role of diamonds in fuelling conflict \r\n \r\n  Letter from the head of the delegation of the \r\nEuropean Commission transmitting a report on \r\nthe progress made towards the implementation \r\nof the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme \r\n(A/62/543 and Add. 1) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/62/L.16) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have received a request \r\nfrom the observer for the European Community to be \r\nthe first speaker in the debate on this item. Members \r\nwill recall that the European Community is Chair of \r\nthe Kimberley Process for 2007.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees, \r\nwithout setting a precedent, to hear the observer for the \r\nEuropean Community, Chair of the Kimberley Process, \r\nas the first speaker in the debate on this item? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 3208 (XXIX) of \r\n11 October 1974, and the decision just taken, I now \r\ncall on the observer of the European Community. \r\n Mr. Kovanda (European Community): It is a real \r\nhonour to have this opportunity to address the \r\nAssembly today, present a report on the work of the \r\nKimberley Process and introduce the content of draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.16.  \r\n Since the Kimberley Process began, in the late \r\n1990s, to better coordinate the international response to \r\nthe phenomenon of conflict diamonds, we have seen a \r\ndramatic turn-around in the security situation in several \r\ndiamond-producing countries, notably, Angola, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Sierra \r\nLeone. Implementation of the Kimberley Process has \r\nboth contributed to and benefited from this progress in \r\nthe real world. The only current case of conflict \r\ndiamonds is that of Côte d’Ivoire, with trade in its \r\ndiamonds being prohibited by Kimberley Process rules \r\nand the Security Council embargo.  \r\n More rough diamonds than ever before are being \r\nhandled in accordance with Kimberley Process rules. \r\nAn estimated 100,000 to 250,000 carats per annum are \r\nproduced in Côte d’Ivoire, compared to the worldwide \r\nannual production of 176 million carats. Virtually all \r\ndiamond producing and trading centres now implement \r\nthe scheme. This year has seen significant seizures and \r\nprosecutions relating to conflict diamonds and \r\nsmuggling. The Kimberley Process is therefore \r\nprotecting the legitimate diamond industry, which \r\nplays a significant part in the economies of many \r\ncountries, thereby giving many people a chance for a \r\nbetter life. \r\n I would like to highlight two examples from this \r\nyear of successful partnership in support of the \r\nKimberley Process, namely, the cases of Ghana and \r\nLiberia. \r\n Last year, in Gaborone, the Kimberley Process \r\nagreed a balanced package with Ghana, which was \r\nfacing criticism regarding its national implementation. \r\nI am now pleased to report considerable improvement. \r\nGhana is implementing a plan of action to control its \r\ninformal sector, with the support of additional \r\nmonitoring and technical assistance provided by the \r\nEuropean Community, South Africa, the United States \r\nand a team led by a past Chairperson of the Kimberley \r\nProcess to assess progress. The diamond industry, \r\nrepresented by the World Diamond Council, has helped \r\nto monitor exports. United Nations experts on Côte \r\nd’Ivoire sanctions have welcomed “the cooperation of \r\nthe Kimberley Process and its efforts to encourage \r\nparticipating States to introduce further improvements \r\nin their internal control systems”. (A/62/543, annex, \r\npara. 8)  \r\nThey also recognized Ghana’s “remarkable efforts that \r\nhave enhanced the credibility of its internal control \r\nsystem and its diamond import/export regime” (Ibid.). \r\n This year in Brussels, it was agreed to move to a \r\nsystem of risk-based monitoring of exports. Ghana \r\ncontinues to work on registering informal miners and \r\nestimating production levels, with the support of the \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 18 \r\n \r\nUnited States, the European Community and World \r\nDiamond Council. \r\n Another good example of Kimberley Process \r\npartnership in action is the case of Liberia. Kimberley \r\nProcess participants and observers — including the \r\nUnited States, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, \r\nCanada, Sierra Leone and the World Diamond Council, \r\nas well as the United Nations Mission in Liberia \r\n(UNMIL) and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme — have all worked closely with the \r\nGovernment of Liberia to advise, train and equip the \r\nGovernment Diamond Office and its officials. In \r\nMarch, the Kimberley Process sent its third expert \r\nmission to Liberia, in close cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations sanctions panel and supported by \r\nUNMIL, and found that Liberia did meet Kimberley \r\nProcess requirements. Those findings were reported to \r\nthe Security Council, which, by its resolution 1753 \r\n(2007) of 27 April 2007, decided to lift the diamond \r\nembargo. Liberia was admitted to the Kimberley \r\nProcess on 4 May 2007. Several friends of Liberia are \r\nworking with its Government to support Kimberley \r\nProcess implementation.  \r\n Again, much remains to be done, but we believe \r\nthis is a real milestone, laying the necessary foundation \r\nfor diamonds to contribute to prosperity, rather than \r\nconflict, in West Africa. \r\n Those two success stories continue the positive \r\nhistory of the Kimberley Process. Participants and \r\nobservers have worked hard during the past year to \r\nstrengthen the Kimberley Process, and have succeeded \r\nin tackling some of the outstanding challenges and in \r\nadvancing standards, particularly with respect to \r\ntrading and manufacturing centres.  \r\n Let me say a word on participation in the \r\nKimberley Process, the continued interest in which \r\nclearly demonstrates its strength and credibility. The \r\nscheme has remained open, on a global and \r\nnon-discriminatory basis, to all countries and regional \r\neconomic integration organizations willing and able to \r\nfulfil its requirements. In addition to Liberia, we \r\nwelcomed Turkey and the Republic of the Congo this \r\nyear. We have worked with applicant countries to \r\nensure that they are fully prepared to assume the \r\nresponsibilities of Kimberley Process participation. \r\nBurkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Mali, Mexico and \r\nTunisia attended the Brussels Plenary and affirmed \r\ntheir intention to join; while Bahrain, Cape Verde, \r\nGabon, Swaziland and Zambia have all expressed an \r\ninterest in future participation. \r\n Civil society’s involvement has been successfully \r\nbroadened, with a record number of non-governmental \r\norganizations attending the Plenary meeting, including \r\nmany from producer countries. It is to be hoped that \r\nthis will lead to greater cooperation between \r\nGovernments and civil society at the national level as \r\nwell. \r\n We have made good progress on monitoring. In \r\nthe past four years, over 50 on-the-ground inspection \r\nvisits have been carried out to Kimberley Process \r\nparticipants and applicants, each staffed entirely by \r\nvolunteers, in a remarkable case of burden-sharing. \r\nAlthough the system of peer review is voluntary, in \r\npractice virtually all participants have demonstrated \r\ntheir openness to scrutiny and their willingness to \r\nimprove. The second round of review visits has now \r\nbeen launched, with one such visit carried out already \r\nand a number under preparation. \r\n At the beginning of this year, the Kimberley \r\nProcess publicly released its production and trade \r\nstatistics for the first time, to increase transparency and \r\nallow others to analyse the data. Statistics form an \r\nintegral part of monitoring, and statistical analyses \r\nwere prepared for all peer review visits over the past \r\nyear. The Kimberley Process analysed the 2006 data, \r\nidentifying a number of human errors, procedures to be \r\ncorrected and issues for further work. All participants \r\nsubmitted the required statistical reports for 2005 and \r\n2006, supported by continuing training opportunities \r\nmade available by the Canadian Government. \r\n We have also seen this past year increasing \r\namounts of technical assistance and training in support \r\nof Kimberley Process implementation, as well as a \r\nwillingness to identify where there are needs. Some \r\ncountries have volunteered to increase their \r\ncontributions to the Kimberley Process by service in \r\nworking groups, training or by providing financing. \r\nThat is a wonderful testimony to the spirit of \r\ncooperation among the three segments that constitute \r\nthe Kimberley Process. \r\n On the technical side, there has been continuing \r\nwork to identify profiles of diamond production so that \r\nanomalies can be picked up. We expect further efforts \r\nover the medium term to place diamond identification \r\ntechniques on a sound scientific basis. \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n19 07-61667 \r\n \r\n Artisanal alluvial diamond mining accounts for a \r\nsignificant proportion of worldwide diamond \r\nproduction, but controlling it involves particular \r\nchallenges, which are the focus of the working group \r\nof artisanal alluvial producers. That group has analysed \r\nthe situation in each country with regard to artisanal \r\nalluvial production, assessing their controls in the light \r\nof Kimberley Process recommendations and \r\nconsidering progress, obstacles encountered and \r\nremaining challenges. It plans to develop further \r\nefforts on capacity building, traceability and tackling \r\nillicit cross-border trade. \r\n With the Brussels Initiative on diamonds from \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, we believe there is a real possibility for \r\nthe Kimberley Process to support a truly regional \r\napproach to diamonds in West Africa. In South \r\nAmerica we also see promising signs of regional \r\ncollaboration to address the challenges of controlling \r\ndiamond production there.  \r\n A review of the Kimberley Process completed in \r\nNovember 2006 concluded that it had been effective in \r\ncurbing the illicit trade in conflict diamonds. But it \r\nalso noted that reforms were needed to adapt to new \r\nchallenges and increasing demands. Many of those \r\nrecommendations have been carried out, putting the \r\nKimberley Process on a more solid footing: a \r\ncompilation of rules and procedures, a new and more \r\ntransparent website and the formalization of two of its \r\nworking bodies. \r\n At the same time, the Kimberley Process \r\npreserves its flexibility to respond pragmatically and \r\nappropriately to the different challenges it faces, \r\nthrough diplomatic messages, technical assistance, \r\ntraining and geological industry or statistical expertise. \r\nThe Kimberley Process, as an innovative model of \r\nburden-sharing, has fostered a sense of ownership by \r\nparticipants and observers, many of whom have \r\ndevoted considerable resources to strengthening \r\nimplementation. Both human and financial resources \r\nhave been deployed by a great many participants, \r\nthrough the provision of technical assistance, \r\nparticipation in working groups and in peer review \r\nteams. \r\n The draft resolution before the Assembly today is \r\nnot a short one. Indeed, it has grown to six pages, \r\nwhich is a testament to the many areas of activity in \r\nwhich the Assembly has been engaged in the past year \r\nand those which are planned for next year. I wish to \r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to a technical change \r\nwhich will be introduced in the final text. The word \r\n“participants” will have a capital “P”.  \r\n But thanks to the hard work of government, \r\nindustry and civil society representatives around the \r\nworld, the Kimberley Process remains one of the most \r\nsuccessful and inspirational examples of how to break \r\nthe link between natural resources and conflict. \r\nAlthough the availability of conflict diamonds is \r\ncurrently much reduced, the Kimberley Process is a \r\nvital tool of conflict prevention and deterrence. \r\n We wish India, as the Chair for 2008, and \r\nNamibia, as Vice-Chair, every success. We assure them \r\nof our support, as we express our gratitude for the \r\nsupport of the past chairs of the Kimberley Process, \r\nwho have all demonstrated great leadership — South \r\nAfrica, Canada, the Russian Federation and Botswana. \r\n I must also express my sincere gratitude to all \r\nthose who have participated in this work over the past \r\nyear, particularly the chairs of the working groups and \r\ncommittees, but also to all those in government, \r\nindustry and civil society who have shown so much \r\ndedication in working together. \r\n It remains for me, on behalf of the European \r\nCommunity, to express my heartfelt thanks to the \r\nUnited Nations, which has been a constant source of \r\ninspiration, support, expertise and encouragement to do \r\nbetter. We have worked closely with the sanctions \r\ncommittees and their experts in the cases of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and Liberia, and look forward to ever broader \r\nand deeper cooperation with all the relevant parts of \r\nthe United Nations system. \r\n Mr. Outlule (Botswana): The delegation of \r\nBotswana extends its sincere appreciation to the \r\ndelegation of the European Community in the person \r\nof Mr. Karel Kovanda, Chair of the 2007 Kimberley \r\nProcess, for introducing an informative, clear, \r\ncomprehensive — in a word, excellent — report under \r\nagenda item 13, as well as for introducing draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.16, as orally corrected. \r\n We commend the European Community for \r\nproviding sterling leadership during its tenure. In this \r\nconnection, we welcome with great appreciation the \r\nsubstantial progress achieved in consolidating and \r\nstrengthening the Kimberley Process, as called for by \r\nthe recommendations of the Kimberley Process Three-\r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 20 \r\n \r\nYear Review and the Gaborone Kimberley Process \r\nannual meeting held in 2006. \r\n The Kimberley Process is critically important to \r\nthe attainment of the universal objective of breaking \r\nthe link between the illicit transaction of rough \r\ndiamonds and armed conflict. It is a clear testimony of \r\nthe phenomenal impact which the individual and \r\ncombined efforts of Governments, industry and civil \r\nsociety can have on matters of international peace and \r\nsecurity. In this respect, the Kimberley Process has and \r\ndeserves our continuing resolute support and \r\nunwavering commitment. \r\n We salute Member States for playing their part by \r\nactively participating and complying with the \r\nrequirements of the Kimberley Process Certification \r\nScheme. That is imperative for both the credibility and \r\nsuccess of the Kimberley Process. The widest possible \r\nparticipation of the international community is \r\nessential for the effectiveness of the Kimberley \r\nProcess. We therefore welcome the Member States that \r\njoined the Kimberley Process during 2007 and \r\nencourage others in a position to join to do so. \r\n I wish to reiterate the fact that for most \r\ndeveloping countries natural resources should be a \r\nblessing rather than a curse. Natural resources are a \r\ncommon heritage of the people and should be a source \r\nof hope for a better life and a better future. \r\n In Botswana and in many other countries in our \r\nAfrican region, we have begun translating this hope \r\ninto reality by ensuring that all mineral rights are \r\nvested in the State. Over the years, the Government of \r\nBotswana consistently used and continues to use the \r\nrevenue from minerals, especially diamonds, to provide \r\neducation, health, housing, roads and \r\ntelecommunications for the benefit of all citizens — in \r\na word, development. \r\n We recognize that there have been outbreaks of \r\nconflict in some parts of the developing world, \r\nparticularly in Africa, in which a diamond, a natural \r\nresource of great beauty, was illicitly used to finance or \r\nfuel conflict, the so-called conflict diamonds. \r\n These so-called conflict diamonds continue to be \r\na matter of serious concern to Botswana and the \r\ninternational community as a whole. However, we are \r\npleased that as a result of the strong support by the \r\ninternational community and initiatives such as the \r\nKimberley Process, significant strides continue to be \r\nmade to halt and prevent the illicit diamond trade. \r\n Today, we, the diamond producers, exporters, \r\nimporters and consumers, have committed ourselves to \r\nupholding the highest standards set for diamond trade, \r\nnot only to safeguard against illicit diamonds entering \r\nlegitimate trade, but also to ensure that never again \r\nwill diamonds be a source of such human destruction \r\nand suffering as was the case in a number of countries \r\nnot too long ago. \r\n The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme has \r\nbeen effectively transformed into a credible and \r\nglobally recognized tracking system for rough \r\ndiamonds, enabling the diamond industry to regain \r\nlegitimacy as well as to promote greater transparency \r\nin the diamond trade. We applaud all Member States \r\nthat have provided leadership in the fight to eliminate \r\nthe illicit transaction of rough diamonds by extending \r\ntechnical support to other countries to fully implement \r\nthe requirements of the Kimberley Process \r\nCertification Scheme. \r\n It is heartening to note that even though a large \r\nmajority of diamonds have always been from \r\nlegitimate sources, today more than ever before, \r\ndiamonds have become a source of funding for social \r\nprogression and economic development in more \r\ncountries, including some countries in Africa that were \r\naffected by conflict. \r\n We are pleased that Liberia, a country that has \r\nemerged from one of the most brutal conflicts, is now \r\ncounted among the countries meeting the basic \r\nminimum requirements of the Kimberley Process. We \r\nare optimistic that with the continued support of the \r\ninternational community, Liberia will progress on a \r\nsteadfast path to full post-conflict recovery and \r\nsustainable economic development. In the not-too-\r\ndistant future, resources, including diamonds, will \r\nundoubtedly contribute immensely to this process. \r\n Commendable progress has also been made in \r\nother countries, such as Sierra Leone and Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. To this end, my delegation is particularly \r\npleased that diamond resources are now increasingly \r\nbeing channelled towards funding critical socio-\r\neconomic benefits such as education, health facilities, \r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, providing clean water, roads, \r\nelectricity and numerous other developmental \r\nchallenges that developing countries confront. \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n21 07-61667 \r\n \r\n Botswana and a number of other countries can \r\nindeed attest to the good that diamonds can do. For the \r\npast four decades diamonds have been our lifeline and \r\nnot only do they continue today to be the mainstay of \r\nour economy, but they promise to do so in the \r\nforeseeable future. A combination of good governance, \r\nvisionary leadership, prudent management and \r\ndiamonds catapulted Botswana from being a least \r\ndeveloped country to its current middle income status. \r\nAnd the proceeds from diamonds remain the critical \r\nrevenue base for causing all our social and economic \r\nindicators to advance. It is for that reason that \r\nBotswana will always go the extra mile to protect the \r\nintegrity of diamonds and their continued appeal to \r\nconsumers. \r\n Botswana fully supports draft resolution \r\nA/61/L.16, as orally corrected. The draft resolution \r\nreaffirms the unique relationship between the United \r\nNations system and the Kimberley Process and \r\nreiterates the validity of continued cooperation. It calls \r\nfor the full implementation of other related Security \r\nCouncil measures and General Assembly resolutions. \r\nThat will help bring better coordination and sharper \r\nfocus to the linkage between the work of the \r\nKimberley Process and that of the United Nations in its \r\nendeavour to maintain international peace and security. \r\n The provisions of the draft resolution endorse the \r\ndecisions of the Brussels Plenary that highlight the \r\nachievements of the Kimberley Process and the \r\nchallenges ahead. It sets out a road map on how to \r\naddress those challenges and to build on best practices. \r\nThat forms the basis of the mandate for the 2008 Chair \r\nof the Kimberley Process. \r\n The delegation of Botswana takes this \r\nopportunity to assure both the incoming Chair of the \r\nKimberley Process, India, and the Vice-Chair, \r\nNamibia, of our continued goodwill, support and \r\ncooperation in the coming years. \r\n We encourage all Member States to support the \r\nadoption of draft resolution A/62/L.16, as orally \r\ncorrected, which embodies our unwavering \r\ncommitment to breaking the link between the illicit \r\ntransaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict, as a \r\ncontribution to the prevention and settlement of \r\nconflicts. \r\n In conclusion, Botswana attaches the utmost \r\nimportance to this matter because it is crucial to our \r\nability to reassure consumers, as we begin this season \r\nof goodwill and giving, that they can buy, give and \r\nwear diamonds with equanimity, in the full knowledge \r\nthat they have been certified conflict-free by the \r\nKimberley Process and that in buying such diamonds \r\nthey are contributing to the development of many \r\ndeveloping countries, including my own country, \r\nBotswana. \r\n Mr. Rodger Young (United States of America): \r\nThe United States is pleased to be a sponsor of the \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.16, on the role of diamonds in \r\nfuelling conflict. \r\n The international community has much to be \r\nproud of when it comes to the efforts of the Kimberley \r\nProcess. It is a tribute to the Kimberley Process that \r\nconflict diamonds today make up only a small \r\npercentage of the world’s diamond market. With the \r\nKimberley Process, the international community now \r\nhas the tools to head off future conflict and promote \r\nstability and security in diamond-rich regions of the \r\nworld. \r\n The unique manner in which Governments, the \r\ndiamond industry and civil society have worked \r\ntogether in the Kimberley Process to monitor and \r\ncontrol the rough diamond trade should stand as a \r\nmodel as we confront other sources of conflict. This \r\nmulti-stakeholder effort demonstrates what can be \r\naccomplished when Governments join forces with the \r\nprivate sector and non-governmental organizations. \r\n We take this opportunity salute our European \r\nCommunity colleagues who have led the Kimberley \r\nProcess in 2007 to encourage the major diamond \r\ntrading and manufacturing centres to strengthen \r\ninternal controls over the diamond markets. European \r\nleadership also positioned the Kimberley Process to \r\naddress the ongoing problem of diamond smuggling \r\nfrom Côte d’Ivoire through neighbouring West African \r\ncountries. We are confident that those initiatives, \r\nlaunched under the European leadership, will remain \r\nthe hallmark of Kimberley Process efforts in the years \r\nahead. \r\n We were also particularly pleased, in 2007, to \r\nwelcome Liberia as a participant in the Kimberley \r\nProcess. The Liberian Government moved quickly in \r\nthe past year to capitalize on international support. \r\nLiberia set up a credible diamond monitoring system to \r\nenable the lifting of Security Council sanctions on its \r\ndiamond exports and to participate in the Kimberley \r\nProcess. We appreciate the long way Liberia has come, \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 22 \r\n \r\nfrom an era when diamonds financed brutal atrocities \r\nto the point today, when diamonds are a positive force \r\nand are playing a positive role in the country’s \r\neconomic reconstruction. \r\n The United States also welcomes the efforts of \r\ndonor countries to provide technical assistance to help \r\nKimberley Process participants strengthen their \r\ninternal controls. We believe that one of the best means \r\nof supporting stability and preventing renewed conflict \r\nin diamond-producing areas is to foster Kimberley \r\nProcess controls at the same time that we support \r\ndevelopment opportunities for mining communities. \r\n We look forward to working closely with India as \r\nit assumes the Chair and with Namibia as it assumes \r\nthe vice-chairmanship of the Kimberley Process in \r\n2008. \r\n Mr. Malhotra (India): I am grateful for this \r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly on \r\nagenda item 13, “The role of diamonds in fuelling \r\nconflict”. \r\n Many developing countries are vitally dependent \r\non their natural resources for achieving their \r\ndevelopment goals. Yet, ironically, those very natural \r\nresources have served to cause and prolong conflict in \r\nseveral countries as a result of the misuse of wealth \r\ngenerated from such resources. Diamonds in particular \r\nhave played a significant role in that regard. In \r\naddition to financing devastating armed conflicts, the \r\nillicit trade in rough diamonds also impacts negatively \r\non the legitimate international trade in diamonds. It is \r\ntherefore crucial to end the trade in illicit diamonds. \r\n The issue of natural resources fuelling conflict \r\nshould not be seen solely through the narrow prism of \r\npeace and security. Instead, efforts to address the issue \r\nmust be made through the perspective of an overall \r\ndevelopment agenda. Moreover, such efforts need to \r\nfocus not only on the supply side, but on all parts of \r\nthe supply chain, including processing, trading and \r\npurchase by the consumer.  \r\n In that regard, the Kimberley Process is an \r\ninnovative and useful mechanism. It approaches the \r\nproblem not merely at the level of extraction, but also \r\nfrom the standpoint of processing and trading. Its \r\nCertification Scheme has been particularly effective in \r\nvalidating and regulating the production of rough \r\ndiamonds and their trade. It fully affirms the \r\nsovereignty of States in the Process and is driven by \r\nvoluntary efforts by its participants. In addition, it has \r\nan inclusive approach that extends to the entire \r\ninternational community, including producing, \r\nexporting and importing countries, as well as the \r\ndiamond industry and civil society. For those reasons, \r\nmajor diamond trading and processing countries such \r\nas India have engaged constructively and actively with \r\nthe Process and support its full implementation. \r\n We welcome the decisions taken at the Plenary of \r\nthe Kimberley Process held in Brussels earlier this \r\nmonth, which are reflected in the Brussels \r\ncommuniqué. In particular, we support the need for \r\nstrong government oversight of rough diamond trading \r\nand manufacturing, with greater internal control. \r\n We would also like to convey our appreciation to \r\nthe European Commission, as Chair of the Kimberley \r\nProcess during 2007, for its efforts during the year \r\ntowards strengthening the implementation of the \r\nProcess and its initiative in the publication of diamond \r\nproduction and trade statistics. We welcome the \r\nre-admission of the Republic of Congo to the \r\nKimberley Process and the joining by Liberia and \r\nTurkey as new participants.  \r\n We would like to congratulate Ghana on its \r\nefforts in the implementation of Kimberley Process. \r\nWe support continuing peer review visits, and would \r\nalso like to thank the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nfor its invitation for a visit next year. We also look \r\nforward to the implementation of the Brussels initiative \r\non diamonds from Côte d’Ivoire.  \r\n As Chair of the Kimberley Process for 2008, \r\nIndia will strengthen the Kimberley Process \r\nmechanism by building on previous traditions and \r\nconventions, and will strive to implement the decisions \r\ntaken during the Brussels Plenary through the active \r\nengagement of the Kimberley Process working groups \r\nand committees. India will continue to extend \r\nassistance to Kimberley Process members to build \r\neffective internal controls on the production, \r\nprocessing and trade of rough diamonds. This is crucial \r\nfor ensuring growth of the legitimate diamond trade \r\nand protection of the livelihoods of so many people \r\naround the globe. We look forward to receiving the \r\nsupport and cooperation of all participants of the \r\nKimberley Process, civil society and industry \r\nrepresentatives.  \r\n In conclusion, while mechanisms like the \r\nKimberley Processes play an important role in \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n23 07-61667 \r\n \r\nbreaking the link between illicit transactions in rough \r\ndiamonds and armed conflict, a lasting solution would \r\nhave to involve the effective and consensual \r\nexploitation of natural resources in a way that benefits \r\nsociety as a whole. \r\n Mr. Mbuende (Namibia): My delegation is \r\npleased to sponsor and support draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.16, on the role of diamonds in fuelling conflict. \r\nIn taking up this draft resolution, the General Assembly \r\nonce again recognizes the reality that trade in conflict \r\ndiamonds remains a crucial factor in prolonging \r\nconflicts in many parts of the world. Most important, \r\nby breaking the link between the legitimate diamond \r\ntrade and conflict diamonds, the General Assembly is \r\nmaking a clear statement that clean diamonds can \r\ncontribute to prosperity and development in many parts \r\nof the world. We hope that similar efforts will be made \r\nso that other natural resources such as oil, timber, gold, \r\ncopper, water and land do not fuel conflicts, and that, if \r\nthey do, the General Assembly will rise to the occasion \r\nand take appropriate action.  \r\n For Africa, diamonds are one of the major natural \r\nresources with which the continent is endowed. About \r\n65 per cent of the world’s diamonds, worth over \r\n$8 billion, are sourced from Africa every year. In \r\nSouthern Africa, the diamond industry employs more \r\nthan 38,000 people; at the global level about 10 million \r\npeople are either directly or indirectly supported by the \r\ndiamond industry.  \r\n From its own experience, Namibia owes its \r\nadvances in development to the exploitation of mineral \r\nresources, especially diamonds, which account for \r\nabout 70 per cent of all our export earnings, 12 per cent \r\nof our gross domestic product and 8 per cent of \r\nGovernment revenue. Last year alone, Namibia \r\nproduced diamonds worth approximately $700 million. \r\nFor our people, every Namibian diamond purchased on \r\nthe world market thus represents food on the table, the \r\nprovision of essential social services such as health \r\ncare, and the construction of more schools, hospitals \r\nand roads to connect our rural communities.  \r\n It is against this background that Namibia wishes \r\nto reiterate its full commitment to the Kimberley \r\nProcess. We believe that the Kimberley Process \r\nCertification Scheme guarantees transparency in \r\nmarketing our diamonds. It also provides a valuable \r\nplatform for cooperation among diamond-producing \r\ncountries.  \r\n Through the multilateral efforts of the Kimberley \r\nProcess we have made remarkable progress in a \r\nrelatively short period of time to control the flows of \r\nconflict diamonds, including through increased \r\nGovernment oversight of the industry. We encourage \r\ndonors to continue helping the diamond-producing \r\ncountries of the Kimberley Process, which need to \r\nbuild and strengthen their capacity to implement \r\ncontrols and monitor the diamond trade from mine to \r\nexport.  \r\n As a diamond-producing country, Namibia has \r\nput in place a robust and comprehensive regulatory \r\nregime in order to protect the integrity of its diamond \r\nindustry from conflict diamonds. In addition, a number \r\nof Government agencies, including the Diamonds \r\nInspectorate in the Ministry of Mines and Energy and \r\nthe Protected Resources Unit of the Namibia police, \r\nhave been established and are specifically charged with \r\nprotecting our diamonds from smuggling and other \r\nillicit activities. In this way, Namibia is contributing to \r\ninternational efforts aimed at curbing the flow of \r\nconflict diamonds and at ensuring international peace \r\nand security.  \r\n My delegation wishes to thank the European \r\nCommission for the leadership it has provided to the \r\nKimberley Process this year. We also wish to \r\ncongratulate India on assuming the chairmanship of the \r\nKimberley Process for 2008. As Vice-Chair, Namibia \r\nlooks forward to a year of continued close cooperation. \r\n Ms. Hulan (Canada): My delegation welcomes \r\nthis opportunity to share views on the important issue \r\nof the role of diamonds in fuelling conflict. Canada \r\nremains a strong supporter the Kimberley Process, \r\nwhich after just four years of operation has increased \r\naccountability, transparency and effective Government \r\nregulation of the trade in rough diamonds. In doing so, \r\nit has had remarkable success in breaking the link \r\nbetween the global diamond trade and armed conflict.  \r\n Allow me to begin by extending my delegation’s \r\nsincere thanks to the European Commission for \r\ncoordinating the resolution before us today, and for its \r\nsuccessful tenure as Chair of the Kimberley Process \r\nover the past year. A number of important \r\nimprovements to the Process have been made under the \r\nCommission’s stewardship, including implementation \r\nof many of the recommendations of the three-year \r\nreview, the near completion of a first round of peer \r\nreview visits and the adoption of the Brussels \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 24 \r\n \r\nDeclaration on internal controls and the Brussels \r\ninitiative on diamonds from Côte d’Ivoire. I would also \r\nlike to take this opportunity to welcome the Republic \r\nof Congo, Liberia and Turkey into the Kimberley \r\nProcess. \r\n Finally, my delegation extends a warm welcome \r\nto India as incoming Kimberley Process Chair, and our \r\ncongratulations go to Namibia on its selection as \r\nVice-Chair for 2008. We look forward to working with \r\nboth delegations to further strengthen the Kimberley \r\nProcess Certification Scheme in the coming year.  \r\n Among the achievements of the past year, \r\nperhaps none has been more important than the \r\nimpressive progress Ghana has made in improving its \r\nsystem of internal controls over rough diamonds. \r\nCanada commends the constructive and transparent \r\nmanner in which Ghana has engaged the Kimberley \r\nProcess, and we welcome the commitment the \r\nGovernment has shown to completing reform of its \r\ninternal controls. We recognize that, in doing so, \r\nGhana is not only bringing itself into compliance with \r\nthe Kimberley Process, but is also making an important \r\ncontribution to ensuring that illicit diamonds from Côte \r\nd’Ivoire do not enter the legitimate global trade.  \r\n Equally, Canada welcomes Liberia’s participation \r\nin the Kimberley Process and commends Liberia’s \r\nefforts to establish a rigorous set of import and export \r\ncontrols for rough diamonds. Following the removal of \r\nthe United Nations diamond sanctions that had been in \r\nplace for six years, Liberia’s first official diamond \r\nexports were made in September 2007. Liberia’s \r\nprogress is testament not only to the Government’s \r\ncommitment, but also to the Kimberley Process \r\nparticipants and observers who have assisted Liberia’s \r\nefforts to eliminate its conflict diamond trade. We offer \r\nour encouragement to Liberia as it continues to refine \r\nits system of controls over rough diamonds.  \r\n Canada also welcomes the emerging regional \r\ncooperation aimed at stemming the illicit cross-border \r\nmovement of rough diamonds in West Africa and South \r\nAmerica. Regional harmonization and cooperation is \r\none of the most promising means of strengthening the \r\ninternational community’s capacity to monitor and \r\ncontrol the movement of rough diamonds, particularly \r\nwhere porous borders make doing so a challenge. We \r\nencourage participants to strengthen regional \r\ncooperation in other parts of the world as well. \r\n One of the unique features of the Kimberley \r\nProcess, and indeed one of the key contributors to its \r\nsuccess, has been the innovation and flexibility that it \r\nhas shown through rigorous self-examination and \r\nimprovement during its first four years. This practice \r\nand the spirit that guides it must be maintained if the \r\nProcess is to be successful in identifying and closing \r\nthe gaps that remain in its system of control over rough \r\ndiamonds. \r\n In particular, the Process will need to be steadfast \r\nin taking timely and effective action to address \r\nemerging crises. One of its most important innovations \r\nin this regard has been the development of a \r\ncomprehensive and credible system of peer review to \r\nmonitor the implementation of Kimberley Process \r\nstandards and practices in participant countries. In this \r\nspirit, we encourage the Process and its members to \r\nexamine the possibility of further developing its \r\ncapacity to expose and address new cases of trading in \r\nconflict diamonds that emerge in the future. \r\n In this regard, Canada recognizes the crucial role \r\nthat nongovernmental organization observers — \r\nparticularly that of Global Witness and Partnership for \r\nAfrica Canada — play in the monitoring, and the \r\nimportant contributions that those organizations have \r\nmade to the credibility and accountability of the \r\nProcess. We are very pleased that the number of civil \r\nsociety organizations participating in the Kimberley \r\nProcess is expanding. Canada urges all participants to \r\ncontinue working constructively with these \r\norganizations, and to recognize their important \r\ncontribution in support of our shared objectives. \r\n The Kimberley Process is making a major \r\ncontribution to breaking the link between rough \r\ndiamonds and armed conflict. It stands as a testament \r\nto what can be achieved through the innovative and \r\nsystematic collaboration of Governments, the United \r\nNations, the private sector and civil society. However, \r\nhere in the United Nations, we have for years \r\napproached the larger issue of natural resources and \r\nconflict on an ad hoc, case by case, resource by \r\nresource basis. Canada strongly encourages the United \r\nNations to consider a more comprehensive approach to \r\nits work in this area. By examining the intersection \r\nbetween the exploitation of natural resources and the \r\npersistence, and in some cases intensification, of armed \r\nconflicts, we believe the international community will \r\nbe better placed to find durable solutions to these types \r\nof conflicts. \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n25 07-61667 \r\n \r\n Mr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): Our delegation feels that the Kimberley \r\nProcess has functioned well and has, to date, made \r\nsubstantial progress in achieving its basic purposes, \r\nincluding discharging tasks set for it by decisions of \r\nthe Security Council and other United Nations bodies. \r\nThat progress has helped significantly to strengthen its \r\nauthority. We would like to commend our colleagues \r\nfrom the European Union for successfully chairing the \r\nProcess this year, in particular, for holding the plenary \r\nmeeting of the Kimberley Process in Brussels from 5 to \r\n8 November of this year and for preparing the draft \r\nresolution on conflict diamonds for the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n Today, the Kimberley Process is a very complex \r\nbody, implementing a whole host of functions that are \r\nsensitive for its participants. Based on this fact, we \r\nbelieve it essential to increase the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to further develop the \r\nmechanisms of the Kimberley Process and its legal \r\nbasis.  \r\n It is obvious that growth in the effectiveness of \r\nthe Kimberley Process directly depends on ensuring \r\nthe universality of its membership and agreement on \r\nthe actions of all its working bodies. In view of the \r\nsignificance of the diamond business and its specific \r\nfeatures, it is important to broaden the circle of \r\nparticipants and observers to the Kimberley Process. In \r\nthis regard, we welcome the decisions of Liberia, \r\nTurkey and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to \r\nbecome full-fledged participants.  \r\n The draft resolution that we are to adopt today \r\nreflects the substantive progress and momentum \r\nachieved under the Kimberley Process in 2007. At the \r\nsame time, we are convinced that much still remains to \r\nbe done to increase effectiveness in implementing the \r\nmandates of the Kimberley Process, in particular, in \r\nrevitalizing work to carry out decisions to review one \r\nof its main foundations, namely, the Kimberley Process \r\nCertification Scheme. We consequently support efforts \r\nto implement recommendations of the plenary sessions \r\nin Gaborone and Brussels, which are aimed at \r\nstrengthening control measures in trading, polishing \r\nand manufacturing centres.  \r\n The peer review mechanism known as the \r\nKimberley Process Certification Scheme is a very \r\nimportant instrument of the Process. We believe that in \r\nplanning and carrying out review visits it is especially \r\nvital to focus efforts on countries with problems in \r\nimplementing the minimum requirements of the \r\nCertification Scheme as well as on those requiring \r\ntechnical assistance.  \r\n For our part, Russia, in its State agencies and in \r\nthe diamond sector and civil society, is prepared to \r\ncontinue to do its utmost within the United Nations, the \r\nKimberley Process, other international organizations \r\nand forums, as well as on a bilateral basis, to prevent \r\nthe use of rough diamonds to fuel international \r\nconflicts.  \r\n In accordance with the decision of the plenary in \r\nGaborone in 2006, Russia was appointed the Chair of \r\nthe Kimberley Process committee on rules and \r\nprocedures. All of our efforts in the past year have been \r\naimed at developing new and improved operational \r\nrules and procedures, with the understanding that they \r\nneed to be aimed at resolving timely committee items \r\nand should be transparent and comprehensible, not \r\nonly to participants to the Process, but to the broader \r\npublic.  \r\n Like others who have spoken on this agenda item, \r\nwe would also like to wish India as the new Chair of \r\nthe Kimberley Process and Namibia as the new \r\nVice-chair success in their posts for the coming year.  \r\n In conclusion, it is obvious that, for technical \r\nreasons, Russia is not listed among the sponsors of \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.16. We would like to state that \r\nwe have now joined the sponsors and we would ask for \r\nthat to be reflected in the official record. \r\n Mr. Kemp (Australia): Australia is a strong \r\nsupporter of the Kimberley Process. After just four \r\nyears of operation, the Kimberley Process has \r\nincreased transparency and facilitated effective \r\ngovernment regulation of the trade in rough diamonds. \r\nAs such, it has had a remarkable success in breaking \r\nthe link between this trade and armed conflict, and is \r\nevidence of what can be achieved through the \r\ncollective efforts of Governments, the United Nations, \r\nthe private sector and civil society. \r\n Australia wishes to fully align itself with the \r\nstatement delivered earlier by the representative of \r\nCanada. Australia also wishes to co-sponsor the \r\nresolution on this item. \r\n Mr. Antonio (Angola): Allow me first to \r\ncongratulate the European Community on a job well \r\ndone during its chairmanship of the Kimberley Process \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 26 \r\n \r\nthis year. That has resulted in a gradual consolidation \r\nof the Process, greater transparency through the \r\npublication of more complete series of production and \r\ntrade statistics, and better overall information about the \r\ndiamond industry throughout the world. I also \r\ncommend the chairmanship for the presentation of the \r\nannual report and the European Commission for its \r\nleadership during the consultations on the draft \r\nresolution now before the Assembly (A/62/L.16), \r\nwhich my country fully supports. I wish a very \r\nsuccessful mandate to India as forthcoming Chair and \r\nto Namibia as forthcoming Vice-Chair. \r\n Since its creation, the Kimberley Process has \r\nmade a valuable contribution to peace and stability, \r\nespecially in Africa. Indeed, the rules introduced by the \r\nProcess have tightened control over both the \r\nproduction and the flow of diamonds in the \r\ninternational market. The establishment of the \r\nKimberley Process Certification Scheme for raw \r\ndiamonds, which went into effect in January 2003, and \r\nthe commitment of the Scheme’s members to its \r\nimplementation, as well as the sanctions adopted by the \r\nSecurity Council, relating primarily to several African \r\ncountries, were decisive factors contributing to the end \r\nof conflicts, including in my country, Angola, where a \r\nwar was being waged over and funded by so-called \r\nblood diamonds. The five-year peace in Angola is, in \r\neffect, a good indication of the success of the \r\nKimberley Process and, in particular, of the \r\nCertification Scheme. \r\n African countries account for approximately \r\n65 per cent of the global production of diamonds, \r\nwhich amounts to an estimated $8.4 billion a year. The \r\neconomies of some African countries are based on the \r\nproduction of and the trade in diamonds; in others, \r\ndiamonds are a key contributor to the well-being of the \r\npopulation and the development of infrastructure. \r\nTherefore, the need to protect and properly manage \r\nsuch a valuable mineral resource cannot be \r\nunderestimated. \r\n Now that the Kimberley Process Certification \r\nScheme is legally valid in more than 45 countries, that \r\ninstrument needs to be supported by an internal control \r\nsystem in each country. Such a system must be \r\ndeveloped in order to give real meaning to each \r\ncertificate issued by the relevant national authority. \r\nTherefore, there is a strong case for building the \r\ncapacity of regulatory and enforcement authorities, \r\nparticularly in Africa, which is home to the main \r\nproducing countries. \r\n In that connection, Angola, one of the pioneers in \r\nlaunching the Kimberley Process, has created the \r\nDiamond Inspection and Safety Corps, a specialized \r\nforce responsible for the safety of Angolan diamonds. \r\nIn particular, it is responsible for ensuring their safe \r\ntransportation to Luanda from mining project sites or \r\nbuying centres in the interior. The force also controls \r\nsecurity at sorting facilities in Luanda and is present at \r\nevery stage as diamond parcels are opened, sorted, \r\nvalued and repackaged for export. \r\n In order to constantly improve the \r\nimplementation of the Kimberley Process Certification \r\nScheme and to update the country’s mining industry so \r\nthat it is in line with the dynamic of the world \r\neconomy, two multisectoral ministerial commissions \r\nhave been established in Angola by presidential decree. \r\nThey are tasked primarily with reviewing existing \r\nnational mining legislation and, in particular, ensuring \r\nthe protection of national diamond resources.  \r\n Those measures have been instrumental in the \r\nprogress made by the Angolan diamond sector over the \r\npast five years of peace. Production nearly doubled, \r\nfrom 5 million carats in 2002 to almost 9.5 million \r\ncarats in 2006. Gross income from diamond sales \r\nnearly doubled as well, from $638 million in 2002 to \r\n$1.2 billion in 2006. During the same period, \r\nGovernment revenue increased threefold, from \r\n$45 million to $165 million. \r\n At the international level, the Republic of Angola \r\nplayed a pivotal role in the establishment, in Luanda in \r\nNovember 2006, of the African Diamond Producing \r\nCountries Association, whose objective is to coordinate \r\npolicies and strategies for the sustained and durable \r\ndevelopment of the African diamond industry. \r\n As rightly stated in paragraph 13 of the draft \r\nresolution before the Assembly, Angola is Chair of the \r\nWorking Group of the Kimberley Process of Artisanal \r\nAlluvial Producers, which was established at a plenary \r\nmeeting of the Process held in Gaborone, Botswana, in \r\nNovember 2006, as a result of successive decisions \r\ntaken at previous plenary meetings held in Gatineau, \r\nCanada, and Moscow, Russia, in 2004 and 2005, \r\nrespectively. As members are aware, the Working \r\nGroup’s mission is to ensure the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations set out in the Moscow Declaration \r\nwith regard to improving internal control over artisanal \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n27 07-61667 \r\n \r\nand small-scale exploration for alluvial diamonds and \r\npromoting the exchange of good practices. \r\n In Angola, artisanal exploration for diamonds is \r\nlegally allowed only in specific areas where \r\nmechanized mining is not commercially viable. A \r\nlicense is mandatory and must be obtained before \r\nartisanal mining activity is allowed. Artisanal diamond \r\nminers — who in Angola are known as garimpeiros — \r\nmust be 18 or older, must possess a valid identification \r\ndocument and must have been a resident for at least \r\n10 years in the country or adjacent area where mining \r\nactivity is to be undertaken. \r\n Given the strategic importance of diamonds, \r\nparticularly for certain African countries, it is \r\nimportant that particular attention be accorded to this \r\narea by the Governments of both their producers and \r\ntheir main importers. The fight against illicit diamond \r\ntrafficking and fraud should therefore be an ongoing \r\ncommitment on the part of all involved. In the context \r\nof combating the illicit cross-border trafficking of \r\ndiamonds, bilateral, subregional and regional \r\ncooperation through economic clusters should continue \r\nto be the focus of consultations among interested \r\nparties with a view to reducing or eradicating that \r\ncrime. \r\n Judging by the progress made thus far by the \r\nKimberley Process, we can attain the objectives set by \r\nthe Assembly when it added this item to its agenda. \r\nThat would make an important contribution to breaking \r\nthe link between illicit transaction of rough diamonds \r\nand armed conflicts — a goal that we can achieve \r\nthrough sustained efforts and concerted action. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n Before we proceed further, I should like to \r\nconsult the Assembly with a view to proceeding \r\nimmediately to consider the draft resolution contained \r\nin document A/62/L.16. In that connection, since the \r\ndraft resolution was circulated only today, it would be \r\nnecessary to waive the relevant provision of rule 78 of \r\nthe rules of procedure. The relevant provision of rule \r\n78 reads as follows: \r\n  “As a general rule, no proposal shall be \r\ndiscussed or put to the vote at any meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly unless copies of it have been \r\ncirculated to all delegations not later than the day \r\npreceding the meeting”. \r\nUnless I hear any objections, I shall take it that the \r\nAssembly agrees with the proposal. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/62/L.16, entitled \r\n“The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the \r\nlink between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds \r\nand armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and \r\nsettlement of conflicts”, as orally corrected.  \r\n Before proceeding to take action on the draft \r\nresolution, I should like to announce that, since the \r\nintroduction of the draft resolution, the following \r\ncountries have joined the sponsors of A/62/L.16: \r\nAngola, Australia, Austria, Croatia, Hungary, \r\nLuxembourg, Moldova, Montenegro, Russian \r\nFederation, Serbia, Singapore and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia. \r\n I would also like to inform members that Japan \r\nhas withdrawn from sponsorship of draft resolution \r\nA/62/L.16.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/62/L.16, as orally corrected? \r\n Draft resolution A/62/L.16, as orally corrected, \r\nwas adopted (resolution 62/11). \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of the agenda item? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n \r\nAgenda item 76 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution A/62/L.13 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Assembly held its debate on this agenda item at its \r\n42nd and 43rd plenary meetings, on 1 November 2007. \r\nIn connection with this item, the Assembly now has \r\nbefore it a draft resolution issued as document \r\nA/62/L.13. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of the \r\nNetherlands to introduce draft resolution A/62/L.13. \r\n Mr. Majoor (Netherlands): I have the honour this \r\nafternoon to introduce under the agenda item entitled, \r\n“Report of the International Criminal Court” draft \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 28 \r\n \r\nresolution A/62/L.13 entitled, “Report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court”.  \r\n In addition to the nearly 100 countries mentioned \r\nin document A/62/L.13, the following countries have \r\nindicated their wish to be included as sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution: Afghanistan, Chad, Chile, Guinea, \r\nHaiti, Madagascar, Montenegro and Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis. This brings the total number of sponsors for this \r\ndraft resolution to 107. \r\n On 1 November, the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court presented the third annual report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to this body. We had a \r\nvery constructive and in-depth debate then, and I do \r\nnot want to repeat that discussion here today. Allow me \r\nthough to highlight a few elements. \r\n The establishment of the Court was the most \r\nsignificant development in recent years in our long and \r\nongoing struggle to eradicate impunity. In the few \r\nyears that it has been operational, the Court has, as was \r\nstated by the United Nations Secretary-General in his \r\nstatement marking the fifth anniversary of the Court, \r\nestablished itself as the centrepiece of a system of \r\ninternational criminal justice. \r\n In that regard, we will continue to strive for \r\nuniversal adherence to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We are therefore very \r\npleased to welcome the countries that have recently \r\nbecome a party to the Rome Statute and it is our \r\nsincere hope that others will join soon. \r\n The International Criminal Court’s annual report, \r\nas well as the debate in the General Assembly a few \r\nweeks ago, underlined the important role the \r\nInternational Criminal Court plays in our common \r\nmultilateral system that aims to end impunity and to \r\nestablish the rule of law, to promote and encourage \r\nrespect for human rights and to restore and maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. It is our firm \r\nconviction that sustainable peace cannot be achieved, if \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes are not brought \r\nto justice. Peace and justice are thus complementary \r\nrequirements. \r\n The President of the International Criminal Court \r\nin his address to the General Assembly stressed the fact \r\nthat cooperation between the Court and the United \r\nNations and cooperation by States and international \r\nand regional organizations are fundamental to an \r\neffectively and efficiently functioning Court — \r\nespecially in relation to the arrest and surrender of \r\naccused persons, the provision of evidence, the \r\nrelocation of witnesses and the enforcement of \r\nsentences. We are pleased that the United Nations has \r\nagain assisted the Court over the last year in its \r\nendeavours through implementation of the Relationship \r\nAgreement. We also welcome the assistance provided \r\nso far by not only by States parties but also by \r\nnon-States parties, and I call on all States to continue \r\nto support the Court’s efforts. The continued support of \r\ncivil society deserves to be mentioned as well. \r\n The draft resolution before us today serves three \r\nmain objectives: first, to provide political support for \r\nthe International Criminal Court as an organization, for \r\nits mandate and its aims, as well as for the work it \r\ncarries out; secondly, to underline the importance of \r\nthe relationship between the International Criminal \r\nCourt and the United Nations, upon which the two \r\norganizations continue to build, on the basis of the \r\nRelationship Agreement and lastly, it serves to remind \r\nStates and international and regional organizations of \r\nthe need to cooperate with the International Criminal \r\nCourt as it carries out its tasks. \r\n The Netherlands hopes that this draft resolution \r\nwill be adopted by consensus and that it will lead to \r\neven greater support for the International Criminal \r\nCourt in its fight against impunity and its attempts to \r\nhold those accused of very serious crimes accountable \r\nfor their actions. \r\n The Acting President: We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolution A/62/L.13. Before giving the \r\nfloor to the speaker in explanation of vote before the \r\nvote, may I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.  \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of the \r\nUnited States of America. \r\n Mr. Wolff (United States of America): The \r\nconcerns of the United States about the Rome Statute \r\nand the International Criminal Court (ICC) are well \r\nknown. They include the ICC’s claimed authority to \r\nassert jurisdiction over nationals not parties to the \r\nRome Statute, including United States nationals, and \r\nthe lack of adequate oversight over the ICC’s \r\nProsecutor, who may initiate cases without first \r\nseeking approval of the Security Council. \r\n A/62/PV.57\r\n \r\n29 07-61667 \r\n \r\n Accordingly, the United States disassociates itself \r\nfrom the consensus on this draft resolution. In spite of \r\nits concerns, the United States made a genuine effort to \r\nwork with the draft resolution’s sponsors to find \r\ncommon ground. Over the past three years, we have \r\nstated clearly, consistently and repeatedly, that we \r\nrespect the rights of other States to become parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute, and we have asked in return that \r\nother States respect our decision and right not to \r\nbecome a party. Our efforts to find common ground \r\nreflect our belief that while parties and non-parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute have different views about the ICC, \r\nthey should nonetheless be able to work together in a \r\nspirit of mutual respect and cooperation to advance \r\ntheir common interests in promoting accountability for \r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  \r\n We are disappointed and surprised to find again \r\nthis year that the sponsors of this draft resolution do \r\nnot appear prepared to move forward in this spirit. \r\nAgain this year, the sponsors have declined to include \r\nlanguage in the draft resolution that expresses respect \r\nfor, or even recognition of, the decisions of some \r\nStates not to become parties to the Rome Statute. The \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution apparently view such a \r\nbasic expression of respect as inconsistent with their \r\naspiration of universal membership for the ICC, as if it \r\nis, in fact, somehow illegitimate for a State to choose \r\nnot to become party to the Rome Statute. By their \r\nactions, they have made clear that the pragmatic modus \r\nvivendi that we have been seeking to promote is simply \r\nnot working.  \r\n As a historical matter, we find some irony in this \r\ncurrent emphasis on universality. During the Rome \r\nConference the United States worked tirelessly to \r\nconvince delegations of the wisdom of an approach to \r\nthe ICC that would have permitted more States to join \r\nthe Court. This appeal was rejected in favour of a \r\nnarrower approach embraced by a smaller group of \r\nlike-minded States.  \r\n As a practical matter, we find this position to be \r\ncounterproductive. The ICC is unlikely ever to attain \r\nuniversal membership. Yet the same ICC supporters \r\nwho refuse to express respect for the decisions of \r\nnon-parties unabashedly seek assistance for the ICC \r\nfrom non-parties, and seek support of non-parties for \r\nassistance to the ICC by the United Nations and other \r\ninternational organizations. They seem to think that the \r\nrelationship with non-parties can be a one-way \r\nproposition, in which ICC parties only take and give \r\nnothing in return.  \r\n Such an unbalanced approach is untenable. \r\nMeaningful assistance from non-parties is far less \r\nlikely to be forthcoming, and cooperative efforts to \r\nadvance the fight against impunity are made far more \r\ndifficult, so long as ICC supporters continue to \r\ndisrespect the positions of non-parties. We will get \r\nfurther together by agreeing to disagree about the ICC \r\nand cooperating on matters of common interest than we \r\nwill through the continuation of efforts by ICC parties \r\nto convert those States who have legally and \r\nlegitimately exercised their right not to join.  \r\n We also note with concern the statement in the \r\ndraft resolution encouraging States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute to take the interests, needs for assistance and \r\nmandate of the ICC into account when relevant matters \r\nare being discussed in the United Nations. To the \r\nextent that by this statement the General Assembly \r\nseeks to encourage a particular group of Member States \r\nto influence the deliberations or decisions of other \r\norgans of the United Nations, we consider it an \r\ninappropriate interference in the work of those organs.  \r\n More generally, we are concerned by the \r\nsuggestion that, as a matter of general principle, it is \r\nthe responsibility of the United Nations to facilitate the \r\nwork of the ICC. In this regard, we note the claim of \r\nthe President of the ICC that the so-called enforcement \r\npillar of the Rome Statute, which includes the arrest \r\nand surrender of suspects and the protection of victims \r\nand witnesses, has been reserved to States and, by \r\nextension, international organizations. This seems to us \r\nto misperceive the relationship between the ICC and \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n It is, of course, true that in some cases the work \r\nof the ICC and the work of the United Nations may be \r\ncomplementary. We note in this regard the decision of \r\nthe Security Council to refer to the ICC the situation in \r\nDarfur. But this will not necessarily be true in every \r\ncase. It is for the Security Council to decide whether \r\nthere are circumstances in which assisting the ICC in \r\nenforcing its decisions will advance the Council’s \r\nefforts to address threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. In such cases, the relevant question is whether \r\nassisting the ICC will advance the Security Council’s \r\nmandate and interests, not whether such assistance will \r\nadvance the ICC’s mandate and interests. Particularly \r\nwhere assistance sought by the ICC may involve \r\nA/62/PV.57  \r\n \r\n07-61667 30 \r\n \r\ndifficult and dangerous tasks that ICC States parties are \r\nunwilling or unable to carry out on their own, there \r\nwill be reasons to question whether the Council should \r\nagree that the United Nations should shoulder such \r\nburdens.  \r\n We welcome the addition of language in this \r\nyear’s draft resolution that requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to report on assistance the United Nations has \r\nprovided to the ICC and, in particular, on the expenses \r\nincurred in connection with such assistance and the \r\nreimbursements received for such expenses. This report \r\nwill provide overdue and much needed transparency \r\nwith respect to such assistance. We expect that it will \r\ninclude information about assistance to the ICC \r\nprovided by United Nations peacekeeping and other \r\nfield missions as well as assistance provided by the \r\nUnited Nations Secretariat in New York and elsewhere \r\nin the United Nations system, and will address the \r\nnature, extent and costs of such assistance, as well as \r\nthe reimbursements received by the United Nations.  \r\n We note in this regard that General Assembly \r\nresolution 58/318 provides that all expenses incurred \r\nby the United Nations in connection with such \r\nassistance shall be paid in full to the Organization. This \r\ndecision underscores the importance of respecting the \r\nseparate status of the two organizations. We look \r\nforward to receiving the Secretary-General’s report and \r\nintend to review it carefully. Accordingly, in \r\nconjunction with this draft resolution, we are writing to \r\nthe Under-Secretary-General for Management to \r\nunderscore our interest in a thorough review of these \r\nissues.  \r\n We regret that this draft resolution has become a \r\nsource of divisiveness rather than an opportunity to \r\nbuild bridges between parties and non-parties to the \r\nICC. We remain sincere in our desire to develop a \r\ncooperative approach to promoting international \r\ncriminal justice, and in our hope that ICC supporters \r\nwill join us in such efforts. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of position before action is \r\ntaken on the draft resolution.  \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/62/L.13. May I take it that the Assembly \r\ndecides to adopt draft resolution A/62/L.13? \r\n Draft resolution A/62/L.13 was adopted \r\n(resolution 62/12). \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 76? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The meeting rose at 6.15 p.m. \r\n"
