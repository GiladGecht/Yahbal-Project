(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of \r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Socialist \r\nRepublic of Sri Lanka. \r\n Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \r\nLanka, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Rajapaksa (spoke in Sinhala; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation) I am pleased to be able \r\nto address the global community on the first day of the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Please accept my congratulations, Sir, on your \r\nassumption of the high office of the President of the \r\nsixty-second session. To Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa, I wish to convey Sri Lanka’s gratitude for \r\nher astute leadership of the sixty-first session. \r\n Sri Lanka can boast of a very old and advanced \r\ncivilization, similar to Greek, Roman and Nile Valley \r\ncivilizations. One of the important characteristics of \r\nour civilization is the use of living languages such as \r\nSinhala and Tamil, two languages used by many even \r\ntoday. I therefore consider it my obligation to use \r\nSinhala, a living language, to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Let me begin by quoting the immortal words of \r\nSir Isaac Newton: “We build too many walls and not \r\nenough bridges”. We all became Members of an \r\nOrganization that was created to let all our voices be \r\nheard and to avoid an approach aimed at resolving \r\nproblems through violence, revenge and blame. Yet we \r\nsee a trend to find fault, to place countries in the dock \r\nand penalize those who do not fall into line. Instead of \r\nseeking solutions through cooperation, we have often \r\ncreated suspicion and built walls between ourselves \r\nthrough double standards. \r\n I am proud to inform the Assembly that, despite \r\nthe significant challenge posed by the ongoing conflict \r\nwith a ruthless terrorist group in the north of our \r\ncountry, we have freed the Eastern Province from \r\nterrorism and restored law and order there. My \r\nGovernment has already launched a massive \r\nprogramme of rehabilitation and reconstruction in the \r\neast. We propose to make the Eastern Province of Sri \r\nLanka a model for development and rehabilitation, \r\nessentially through our own effort but also with the \r\nassistance of all donors. We are taking steps to return \r\nthe usurped rights of the people by conducting \r\nprovincial and local Government elections in the east \r\nearly next year. There is a clear opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to play a vital role in breaking \r\nthe cycle of conflict by focusing on development. \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 2 \r\n \r\n We launched military operations only to exert \r\npressure on terrorists in order to convince them that it \r\nwould not be possible for them to obtain a military \r\nvictory. Our goal remains a negotiated and honourable \r\nend to this unfortunate conflict. I must say that the All \r\nParty Representative Committee is working \r\nsuccessfully towards it. \r\n Sri Lanka was one of the first developing \r\ncountries to promote universal health and education, \r\ngender equality and social mobilization. We have been \r\nable to achieve exceptional socio-economic \r\nindicators — way ahead of those normally expected of \r\na country in the lower-middle income range — and are \r\non the way to achieving or surpassing many of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. It is a beautiful sight \r\non our rural roads to see thousands of children in clean \r\nwhite uniforms heading for school. It is a fine example \r\nof our success in achieving education for all. \r\n Despite 25 years of brutal terrorism, we have \r\nbeen able to continue with this social development. My \r\nGovernment maintains a policy of openness and \r\ncooperation with all international human rights \r\nmechanisms, and a number of high-level officials have \r\nvisited Sri Lanka recently. Sri Lanka’s ancient \r\ncivilization was rooted in the Buddhist principles of \r\nmetta and ahimsa — metta being loving kindness to all \r\nliving beings and ahimsa being a deep respect for life. \r\nHuman rights have been an essential part of our great \r\ncultural tradition for millennia. It is therefore nothing \r\nnew for us to protect human rights. Women in \r\npre-colonial Sri Lanka enjoyed rights that are \r\nprescribed under the Convention on the Elimination of \r\nAll Forms of Discrimination against Women — \r\nincluding rights of property ownership and inheritance \r\nrights. It was certainly no accident that Sri Lanka \r\nproduced the first democratically elected woman Prime \r\nMinister in the world in 1960. \r\n Guided by the principles of Buddhism, we have \r\nlong respected the rights of our fellow human beings. It \r\nhas therefore not been necessary for us to experience \r\nglobal wars or the deaths of millions to learn to \r\nrecognize their value. My country has no record of \r\ninflicting misery on fellow human beings for the \r\npurpose of empire-building, for commercial advantage \r\nor for religious righteousness. Sri Lanka, as one of the \r\nfounding members of the Human Rights Council, \r\nbelieves that human rights are too important to be used \r\nas a tool to victimize States for political advantage. It \r\nis essential that international action to facilitate \r\ncompliance with human rights standards be fair and \r\neven-handed. Human rights have to be protected and \r\nadvanced for their own sake, not for political gain. \r\n Even as we are gathered here, State sovereignty, \r\ncivil society and the rule of law are increasingly being \r\nthreatened by terrorism and other illegal and illicit \r\nactivities in many countries. We need to be vigilant \r\nabout these activities. Although the United Nations \r\nsystem has set up mechanisms to deal with many of \r\nthese problems, the capacity of the United Nations to \r\naddress these challenges effectively has been brought \r\ninto question. There are many Member States \r\nrepresented in the Assembly today that have first-hand \r\nexperience of the havoc caused by brutish terrorism, \r\nwhich has stretched out its claws to many corners of \r\nthe world to mar innocent lives. All terrorist attacks —\r\nwhether in New York, Mumbai, Cairo, London or \r\nColombo — are acts that threaten the democratic way \r\nof life, and must be condemned unreservedly. \r\n Terrorism anywhere is terrorism. There is nothing \r\ngood in terrorism. Sri Lanka has taken an up-front \r\nposition in the global community’s efforts to deal with \r\nterrorism. We have become party to 11 of the 13 United \r\nNations conventions for the suppression of various acts \r\nof terrorism. We think that the comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism — which, in our \r\nview, remains a priority — is a hostage to endless \r\ndiscussion. I emphasize that we must conclude those \r\nnegotiations soon. \r\n In whatever continent there are conflicts, those \r\nwill affect the world economy. Peace in the Middle \r\nEast would have a great impact on our economy. \r\nSolutions sought for conflicts in various countries must \r\nbe indigenous. Otherwise, even if the international \r\ncommunity is appeased, people in the countries saddled \r\nwith conflicts will not be satisfied. That would be a \r\nblow to democracy. At this point, we must focus our \r\nattention on the Palestinians who are striving for an \r\nindependent State. The world community must help \r\nthem to manage their country without any undue \r\ninfluence. \r\n We strongly support the strengthening of United \r\nNations mechanisms for countering fund-raising for \r\nillegal and illicit activities. We encourage the \r\nSecretary-General to allocate more resources to this \r\narea, especially to enhance technical skills in countries \r\nthat do not have such skills. Many developing \r\ncountries would benefit from such assistance. We need \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n3 07-51584 \r\n \r\nto have a better mechanism to provide solutions to the \r\nproblems confronting us. Support from all Member \r\nStates should be obtained for this purpose. \r\n The United Nations has a mixed record of \r\nachievements. As resources received by the United \r\nNations are limited, it has been only possible to deliver \r\nlimited results. We need to focus on these as they often \r\nhave been characterized by countless, poorly \r\ncoordinated, ineffectively designed, ineptly staffed and \r\noverlapping programmes, with unnecessary inter-\r\nagency competition. The United Nations must always \r\nremember that its primary function is to render \r\nassistance for the well-being of its Member States. \r\n We have rounded the Development Decade \r\ndeclared by the General Assembly. My country has \r\ndeclared the “Mahinda Chintana” 10-year vision to \r\nusher in a new Sri Lanka in line with those goals. \r\nThrough that we are committed to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We have accorded \r\npriority to the areas liberated from terrorism, those that \r\nhave been devastated by natural disasters and rural \r\nareas lagging behind in development. However, it is a \r\nhuge challenge for us to fill the gap created by the loss \r\nof human lives arising out of disasters. \r\n We are implementing a rural development \r\ninitiative based on “Maga Neguma”, the road \r\ndevelopment programme, and “Gama Neguma”, the \r\nrural reawakening programme and a national \r\ninfrastructure development initiative. The “Mahinda \r\nChintana” 10-year development vision includes \r\ncontinuous qualitative upgrading of education and \r\nhealth programmes in all areas, livelihood initiatives \r\nfor low-income groups, and broad social welfare \r\nprogrammes covering poor and disadvantaged \r\nmembers of society, aimed specially at children and \r\nwomen. We also implement programmes to protect our \r\npeople from narcotic drugs and diseases transmitted \r\nthrough social contact. \r\n The working population, as well as low-income \r\nand poor groups in developing countries such as ours, \r\nface tough challenges due to escalating world oil prices \r\nand increases in the prices of essential food items. \r\nSimilarly, we are severely affected by natural disasters \r\nand uncertainties in the world financial markets. For \r\nthose reasons, it has become a challenge to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals declared by the \r\nAssembly. \r\n The World Bank, established for economic \r\ndevelopment, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \r\nwhich was set up for financial stability, and other \r\nregional banks established at the same time as this \r\nworld organization, all need to implement new \r\nprogrammes to assist the countries affected by these \r\nchallenges. Priority must be given to providing \r\nresources for this purpose. \r\n I believe that our obligation as global leaders at \r\nthese sessions of the General Assembly, is to commit \r\nourselves to programmes that will eradicate terrorism, \r\nestablish human-welfare-oriented development, \r\nestablish democracy and ensure there is hope for \r\nlow-income groups for economic development. \r\nAccordingly, I appeal to the global community to make \r\nthe sixty-second session the beginning of a new \r\nchapter, rather than just another session. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \r\nstatement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Duarte Frutos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Paraguay.  \r\n Mr. Duarte Frutos, President of the Republic of \r\nParaguay, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Duarte Frutos (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGovernment of Paraguay comes to the Assembly to \r\nreaffirm its importance in examining the world \r\nsituation. We have also come in order to further \r\nstrengthen the United Nations as a body fit to represent \r\nthe interests of all countries and ensure the \r\neffectiveness of international law. \r\n For that reason, Sir, I express my support for your \r\nsuccessful presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 4 \r\n \r\nsixty-second session. It is urgent for us to contribute \r\nnot only to meeting the objectives of the United \r\nNations, but also to ensuring that the principles \r\ngoverning its functioning truly find expression. The \r\nworld needs a better, more just and brotherly world \r\norder now. \r\n From this lofty universal rostrum, we customarily \r\nspeak with eloquent urgency, but the practice of States, \r\nin particular of the most powerful, has not always been \r\none of cooperating in order to overcome the \r\nuncertainties that overshadow our future.  \r\n In recent sessions of the Assembly, we have \r\nfocused on the challenges of the new millennium, but \r\nwhile we have been looking far ahead, in the first \r\ndecade of this new century alone, relations among \r\ncivilizations have clearly been marred by an absence of \r\npeace and harmony.  \r\n It has not mattered that more than half of the \r\nworld’s population continues to live in poverty. Of \r\ngreater importance has been the senseless squandering \r\nof money on weapons and the terrible effect this has \r\nhad on the world economy. Note how the price of oil \r\nhas rapidly increased and how countries, such as ours, \r\nwhich do not produce oil, have had to make great \r\nsacrifices. How much money could have been used to \r\nalleviate poverty! As long as capital is concentrated in \r\none area and poverty continues to rise, world peace \r\nwill be precarious.  \r\n In Paraguay, in South America, we are calling for \r\nthe globalization of democracy combined with social \r\ndevelopment. We are calling for the universalization of \r\nsecurity based on respect for human rights and on the \r\ndignity of human life. \r\n In this way we hope to build a regional \r\ncommunity and a global union, which will work \r\ntogether to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty, and \r\nwhich will effectively cooperate to promote the \r\nparticipation of all in prosperity by providing quality \r\neducation and a system of social protection without \r\nexclusion.  \r\n In Paraguay, we are struggling for economic \r\nstability, for political stability and for social peace. \r\nWith these ideals, I have been working very hard at the \r\nhead of the Government to make significant changes \r\nand score important advances. We have sought radical \r\nchange beyond what is needed by the Paraguayan \r\nsociety. The achievements we have attained require \r\nthat we continue the progressive policy to which we \r\ncommitted ourselves when we assumed office. \r\n Since we took office in 2003, following a \r\nturbulent transition that was constantly undermined by \r\nviolence and conspiracy, Paraguay has institutionalized \r\npolitical stability — not an easy task in an environment \r\nof political division and with a parliament that did not \r\nalways meet its responsibilities in governing jointly. \r\nNevertheless, political stability has been, and continues \r\nto be, one of the defining characteristics of our \r\nGovernment. Through great perseverance, we have \r\nsucceeded in permanently institutionalizing political \r\nstability. We did so because I understood that stability \r\nhad to be the framework for achieving economic \r\ndevelopment, which is so crucial to achieving our plans \r\nfor incremental growth. Having achieved economic \r\nstability, we began a process of growth of historic \r\nproportions. After 20 years, Paraguay was able to \r\novercome stagnation. Despite the terrible drought in \r\nthe country, which continues to this day, Paraguay \r\nexperienced an average annual rate of economic \r\ngrowth of 4 per cent for the period 2003-2007. \r\n Moreover, my country has also recorded a \r\nbudgetary surplus. We have also markedly improved \r\nour tax receipts and are waging a difficult battle to \r\ncontrol inflation. Through that policy, not only have we \r\nconsiderably increased our financial reserves, which \r\nhave tripled, but for the first time in its history \r\nParaguay is today able to pay its foreign debt in full \r\nand still continue to hold international reserves. Our \r\nexports are at a historical high, having doubled during \r\nmy term of office. Another relevant factor has been the \r\nsustained growth in per capita production, which will \r\nrise from $915 to $1,800 by the end of my mandate, in \r\n2008.  \r\n More generally, the Government has been \r\npursuing plans aimed at strengthening various areas of \r\nthe economy, including the industrial, commercial and \r\nservice sectors. We have encouraged the transformation \r\nof the country’s economy while coordinating and \r\nintegrating the various sectors of production and \r\nfacilitating the distribution, circulation and \r\nconsumption of domestically produced goods. We have \r\nthereby been able to lower the rate of poverty we \r\ninherited from previous Governments — which is now \r\napproaching 38 per cent, down from the 46 per cent at \r\nwhich it stood in 2003.  \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n5 07-51584 \r\n \r\n However, the poverty and marginalization of \r\nmillions of our fellow citizens continues to be the most \r\nobvious threat to democracy and political stability in \r\nParaguay as well as the region. Our belief that we will \r\ncontinue to overcome poverty is due to the \r\nGovernment’s significant investment in society. Never \r\nbefore have so many houses been built nor more \r\nresources devoted to the most vulnerable members of \r\nour society. Next year, we will earmark 50 per cent of \r\nthe country’s budget for the fight to reduce poverty.  \r\n As a multi-ethnic country, we have not ignored \r\nthe education of our indigenous citizens. We have built \r\nschools and established special programmes. As a \r\nbilingual country, we have both ensured Guaraní-\r\nlanguage education at all levels and worked towards \r\nhaving it recognized as a third official language of the \r\nCommon Market of the South (MERCOSUR). Prior to \r\nthe establishment of present-day borders, Guaraní was \r\nalso spoken in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Bolivia. \r\n The Government over which I preside has \r\nensured unfettered political freedom, as well as \r\nfreedom of the press, association and expression. \r\nUnfortunately, the media have not always taken \r\nadvantage of the freedom of the press in order to \r\nbecome channels for truthful information, serious and \r\nresponsible opinion and constructive and reasoned \r\ncriticism — much less to overcome its vestigial \r\nManichaeism and instead to become a source of culture \r\nand daily provider of knowledge and ethical values. \r\n Political parties are independent and represented \r\nin the parliament. Those not in parliament exercise \r\ntheir rights freely as new political parties are formed.  \r\n There is in fact pluralism in Paraguay, although \r\nthe absence of an adequate civic culture on the part of \r\nmost political actors has kept it from genuinely \r\ncontributing to the essential consensus needed to \r\ndefend the country’s overall interests and promoting \r\nequitable development within it. Unfortunately, \r\nremnants of fascism and conservatism continue to \r\nhamper coexistence in an environment of diversity and \r\ndifference, while also conspiring against the country’s \r\nprogress. \r\n Nevertheless, our struggle for a participatory and \r\ninclusive democracy that promotes social justice has \r\ntransformed the governing party. Today’s governing \r\nparty is promoting an advanced philosophy of social \r\nchange. It is also the political organization generating \r\nrenewal and social mobilization to overcome the old \r\nparty-based oligarchy that was so damaging to \r\nParaguay. The party has therefore assumed \r\nresponsibility for transforming the system whereby the \r\nState and its policies were subjugated to individual \r\ninterests. Through its political independence, the party \r\nis in a position to able to eliminate illegitimate \r\nprivileges and the illicit groups that control the \r\neconomy, finances and large land holdings.  \r\n We are continuing to modernize Paraguay by \r\nlinking the entire country with roads, exponentially \r\nexpanding its economy and ensuring that all citizens \r\nbecome part of the nation’s social capital and possess \r\nthe qualities and competitiveness required by today’s \r\nsocieties. Most of the people of Paraguay understand \r\nthat the historic steps we have taken in that direction \r\nmust continue and become irreversible. Today, anarchy, \r\ndemagoguery and theological feudalism pose a \r\nregressive threat to peace, the secular State, the rule of \r\nlaw and the institutional order we are building. \r\n Paraguay is the most open and dynamic country \r\nwith regard to the regional integration agenda. Our \r\nsupport for MERCOSUR is a clear reflection of our \r\nnational policy. We believe in MERCOSUR. We \r\nbelieve in regional integration. We believe in the \r\npossibility of Latin America having a louder voice in \r\nthe world in order to manage and humanize the process \r\nof globalization. \r\n My Government also endorses and supports the \r\nproposed union of South American nations, which will \r\nabove all make us stronger in claiming and defending \r\nour rights in an environment of asymmetrical \r\nglobalization and better able to contribute to world \r\npeace and more equitable distribution of international \r\ntrade and financing for development.  \r\n The international mobilization of financial and \r\ntechnological resources is today threatening the \r\nstability and overall progress of countries. Speculative \r\ninvestments flow to countries and regions where the \r\nwork force is subjected to exploitation. Then comes the \r\ninvasion; and, through unfair competition, our \r\nindustries are damaged and shut down. At the same \r\ntime, our raw materials are undervalued. What capital \r\nshould do is to promote industrialization, or at least \r\nensure that the terms of trade become fairer instead of \r\nbeing imposed unilaterally.  \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 6 \r\n \r\n We have to change this trend. The international \r\neconomic order should promote a more equitable world \r\neconomy. Through solidarity, cooperation and fair \r\ntreatment, all countries of the world should be admitted \r\ninto the club of development. In Latin America, and in \r\nParaguay, we don’t need charity; we need markets, \r\ntransparency, technology, and the lifting of protective \r\ntrade barriers.  \r\n The United Nations should reflect this \r\nphilosophy. For this reason, its reform cannot be \r\ndelayed any longer. Its priority concerns should not be \r\nwar, armed conflict or even terrorism, whether real or \r\nstrategic. On the contrary, its priorities should be \r\nprogrammes to end poverty, ignorance and \r\nunemployment. We must educate and distribute in \r\norder to build a culture of democratic participation in \r\nthe wealth of humanity. \r\n Paraguay, like the other 30 landlocked developing \r\ncountries, continues to suffer marginalization and a \r\nlack of proper access to international markets. The \r\nabsence of preferential treatment for us from the more \r\ndeveloped economies has denied us a more competitive \r\nparticipation in trade, as well as, access to quotas and \r\nto higher tariffs. \r\n Paraguay is not only aware of the serious \r\nconsequences of climate change; it also suffers from \r\nthem. Proof of this is the catastrophe our country is \r\nsuffering through prolonged drought and the dreadful \r\nfires that have destroyed a major part of our territory. I \r\ntake this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude \r\non behalf of my people and my Government to the \r\ncountries that have come to our aid in this national \r\nemergency. In particular, I would like to thank, from \r\nthis rostrum, my friend Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, \r\nPresident of Brazil, Nestor Kirchner, President of \r\nArgentina, my friend President Chavez of Venezuela, \r\nand the other heads of Government and multilateral \r\norganizations that have worked with us. \r\n Paraguay recognizes the importance of including \r\ngender issues in the agenda of the United Nations and \r\nthe need for effective coordination among all agencies \r\nand organs in the United Nations system in addressing \r\nthe situation of women in the world, particularly in \r\ndeveloping countries. Increasingly and emphatically, \r\nwe reject existing inequalities between men and \r\nwomen whether they be political, economic, social or \r\ncultural. Irrespective of the domestic actions we take to \r\ncombat discrimination, we believe that the United \r\nNations is the most appropriate forum for designing \r\nprogrammes in support of national policies to bring \r\nabout true equality.  \r\n The Government of Paraguay would also like to \r\ntake this opportunity to express once again for its \r\nsupport for the request for admission into the United \r\nNations of the Republic of China, Taiwan, a nation that \r\nhas continued to struggle for its freedom and wishes to \r\nbe a member of the United Nations in accordance with \r\nRules 59 and 60 of the Provisional Rules of the \r\nSecurity Council and Article 4 of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n In conclusion, inequalities among our peoples are \r\nnot part of the human condition. On the contrary, they \r\nare the result of iniquitous relations that separate us \r\nand draw us apart. That being the case, we need only to \r\nshow determination in building a universal community \r\nmarked by greater equanimity and balance. This \r\ndetermination should be given expression by \r\ngovernments and citizens and should draw on the \r\nconcerted efforts of States and civil society.  \r\n What we are seeing, however, is that the \r\ncountries that have most want more. Their humanism is \r\ndisguised in hand-outs and philanthropy when what the \r\nworld needs is greater solidarity and justice. We need \r\nto share science and technology; we need to share \r\nmarkets. The pretence of cooperation to help countries \r\nachieve balanced development is not only denounced \r\nin fruitless rhetoric; it is also exposed in protectionism \r\nand in investment choices. \r\n As long as this bipolar situation continues to \r\nprevail in the world, an organization such as the United \r\nNations serves little purpose. Only when the powerful \r\ncountries stop taking advantage of the less powerful \r\ncountries will the United Nations be able to have a true \r\nimpact on the lives of people. \r\n This alternative is the process that we are \r\ninvolved in today. Many Governments representing \r\ncountries in the Third World have begun to seek our \r\nown freedom. We are drawing a new map on the \r\ninternational scene.  \r\n I am compelled to mention this historic challenge \r\nin my final statement to the General Assembly of the \r\nUnited Nations because on 15 August 2008, I will hand \r\nover power to the new Government in my country. But \r\nI will continue to fight with greater fervour to help \r\nchange the world. I am committed as ever to the \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n7 07-51584 \r\n \r\ndifficult struggle to build a new world order, to ensure \r\nequality, social justice and solidarity for all countries, \r\nfor all women and for all men. I will fight for their \r\nemancipation and their progress. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Paraguay for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Senegal. \r\n Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency, \r\nMr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Wade (spoke in French): Senegal \r\nwelcomes Mr. Kerim’s election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. We \r\ncongratulate him and will support him as he carries out \r\nhis important responsibilities. His predecessor, Sheikha \r\nHaya Rashed Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain, a \r\ncountry which is a friend to Senegal, deserves our \r\ntribute and appreciation for her outstanding \r\ncontribution, throughout her term of office, to the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.  \r\n I also would like to take a moment to \r\nacknowledge my brothers and sisters in the diaspora, \r\nwho this year commemorated the 200th anniversary of \r\nthe abolition of slavery. That shameful and repugnant \r\ntrade constituted the worst of attacks on the dignity of \r\nthe human person, as did its continuation, colonization. \r\nThat is why I would now solemnly warn against \r\nhorrendous revisionist arguments that attempt in vain \r\nto falsify history. Colonialism in its design and \r\nexclusive logic of domination, exploitation and \r\nenslavement cannot boast of any civilizing mission or \r\nany positive fallout, because by its very nature it is a \r\nnegation of the human condition. We must remain \r\nvigilant and mobilized. In Senegal we say yes, we will \r\nforgive, but we will not forget or agree to \r\nmanipulation. \r\n The high-level discussion we held on \r\n24 September on the serious issue of climate change \r\nconfirms once again the terrible threat that is hanging \r\nover our planet. I therefore welcome the initiative of \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to put this \r\ncrucial issue at the very heart of our agenda. We have \r\nall seen the damage done. Mankind has not been wise. \r\nWe have, with greater or lesser awareness, destroyed \r\nthis Earth which God has lent to us. We must beseech \r\nhis forgiveness. \r\n Combating climate change demands innovative \r\nsolutions, which must take into account the special \r\nsituation of countries that are not significant polluters \r\nbut which nevertheless suffer from the serious \r\nconsequences of this phenomenon of the modern age.  \r\n Senegal is aware of its responsibility to join the \r\nstruggle against pollution. Therefore, in exploiting our \r\nmineral resources, we take particular care to restore the \r\necosystem and to use non-polluting practices and \r\ntechnologies. We have also prohibited the importation \r\nof used cars more than five years old and of household \r\nappliances that pollute. As we have already mentioned, \r\nwe do not want Africa to be a dumping ground for \r\noutdated technology from Europe or elsewhere.  \r\n We are also gradually establishing a policy of \r\ncombating coastal erosion. On the Atlantic coast, at the \r\nhigh-tide line, we are building a reinforced concrete \r\nwall on the granite or clayey base of the continental \r\nshelf, 2.5 to 3 metres deep by 40 centimetres thick, to \r\nslow the advance of the sea. Experts say that the wall \r\nwill stop the sea’s advance for 50 to 100 years. We \r\nhave done this on an experimental basis, since it is \r\nvery expensive. The wall costs $2,000 per metre. We \r\nhave constructed 2 kilometres as an example, to show \r\nthat it is possible, because we consider it the ultimate \r\nweapon.  \r\n We are also launching a project for ports leading \r\ninto free zones, alternating with tourist complexes, \r\nalong the Atlantic coast; that is also a way of stopping \r\nthe advance of the sea. Coastal erosion, from Morocco \r\nto Mauritania to Senegal, is a threat which the \r\ninternational community must take very seriously.  \r\n In the Sahel region, we Africans are also planting \r\nwhat we call the great green wall, 7,000 kilometres \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 8 \r\n \r\nlong by 150 kilometres wide from Dakar to Djibouti. \r\nWe have not waited; each of us in our own country has \r\nbegun to create the “wall”. The European Union and \r\nFrance, as Mr. Sarkozy has said, are ready to provide \r\nus with loans to help with the wall in order to stop the \r\nencroaching Sahel and the process of desertification.  \r\n We have also tried to take advantage of the \r\nbillions of tons of water that, each year during the \r\nrainy season, fall on the Sahel and are absorbed by the \r\nearth or flow into the sea. In Senegal we have therefore \r\nbuilt holding basins in the most low-lying areas, where \r\nrunoff water accumulates. We have built 250 of these \r\nbasins; we are walking the walk. The African countries \r\nmeeting in Bamako have decided to implement this \r\nprogramme, from Dakar to Djibouti, to create such a \r\n“wall” to stop the encroaching desert. \r\n At Senegal’s initiative, non-oil-producing \r\ncountries have now established an association that we \r\ncall the Green OPEC, with the aim of protecting our \r\ninterests. We call on the international community to \r\ntake on the excess costs with which we have been \r\nburdened owing to increases in the price of oil. We also \r\nwant to turn Africa towards producing biofuels. For \r\nthis reason, I welcome the launch, here in New York on \r\n2 March 2007, of the International Biofuels Forum. As \r\nPresident of the African Non-Petroleum Producers \r\nAssociation, I solemnly request that all of the Forum’s \r\ninitiatives and participants pursue our common goal of \r\npromoting alternative energy sources. \r\n As we pursue economic and social development \r\nin the South, African countries in particular continue to \r\nface insurmountable obstacles, such as agricultural \r\nsubsidies in developed countries. We have already \r\ntalked about that subject enough. Paradoxically, at the \r\nsame time that our countries are being forced to open \r\ntheir markets in the name of free trade, developed \r\ncountries are subsidizing their own products, so we are \r\nno longer able to export our products to the developed \r\nworld. \r\n As I said at the Group of Eight summit in \r\nHeiligendamm, Germany, Africa is not poor. It has \r\nbeen impoverished by unjust trade practices and by the \r\nexploitation of its resources, which are not bought at \r\ntheir true price. I wish to add that trade measures are \r\nnot in themselves enough to wipe out the injustice that \r\nhas been done. We also need genuine economic \r\nmeasures. \r\n If we want to fend off the advance of poverty, we \r\nmust be creative. But first, what is poverty? It is \r\ncertainly not an income of less than a dollar a day, the \r\ndefinition advocated by the United Nations. Poverty, in \r\nmy view, is a set of unmet needs. Poverty is a leaky \r\nroof, or not having a roof over one’s head at all. It is \r\npoor-quality food, no drinking water, no clothing, no \r\nhealth care, no education or training. Lastly, being poor \r\nis not having a clean environment. That is what I call \r\nthe cluster of needs, which is an entire set of needs \r\nand, as we can see, not just a monetary assessment.  \r\n What are we in Senegal doing? We have launched \r\na programme to build housing, called the Jaxxay plan, \r\nunder the slogan of “one family, one roof”. We build \r\nnice, affordable homes. For less than $70 a month, \r\npeople can become homeowners in Senegal. The \r\ndevelopment in which we are building those houses \r\nprovides health, education and other services. That is \r\nhow we are trying to combat poverty. \r\n Allow me to turn to the digital revolution. We \r\nbelieve that Africa has a great opportunity, because the \r\ndigital revolution is happening now. The Internet \r\ncontains all the knowledge in the world. Africans must \r\ntherefore have access to the Internet for their training, \r\ninformation and educational needs and in their \r\nuniversities and schools. For that reason, as Africa’s \r\nrepresentative to the World Summit on the Information \r\nSociety, organized by the International \r\nTelecommunication Union in Geneva in 2003, I \r\nproposed a Global Digital Solidarity Fund to bridge the \r\ndigital gap that separates us from the developed world. \r\nAfter many ups and downs, the Fund is now supported \r\nby all of the Members of the United Nations. \r\nUnfortunately, the majority have not yet formalized \r\ntheir acceptance of this Fund or have begun paying into \r\nit. However, all countries in principle are members of \r\nthis Fund, which seeks to provide computers to Africa \r\nand to be involved in various programmes, like \r\nhealthcare telematics.  \r\n In Geneva we launched what is called the Geneva \r\nPrinciple, which asks countries and producers of \r\ninformation and communication technology to \r\nvoluntarily donate one per cent of the amount of each \r\ntransaction to the Digital Solidarity Fund.  \r\n Let us now discuss the Security Council and the \r\nneed for Africa to have a seat therein, irrespective of \r\nany question of reform. It is the only continent which \r\nis not represented in the Security Council, even though \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n9 07-51584 \r\n \r\nit has been said that 70 per cent of the Council’s \r\nbusiness involves Africa. \r\n Today, Senegal is at peace — I shall not dwell on \r\nthis — and we are trying to provide the materials and \r\nthe personnel needed for Darfur. Senegal is increasing \r\nits contingent from 150 to 1,600 and is also providing \r\nall the police for the operation conducted by the \r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations.  \r\n The Middle East situation still gives serious \r\nconcern and I wish to reconfirm Senegal’s unwavering \r\nsupport for the just cause of the Palestinian people in \r\ntheir legitimate quest for a viable State. We support all \r\nefforts to that end.  \r\n Remembering the last two wars, we must really \r\ntry to achieve peace. Peace is not just the absence of \r\nwar as somebody said this morning. We must combat \r\nwar in the minds of men, particularly young people.  \r\n In March 2008, Senegal will have the honour of \r\nhosting the eleventh Islamic Summit Conference. It is, \r\ntherefore, my deepest hope that we will make progress \r\ntowards achieving peace in accordance with our \r\nreligion and the Qur’an. I have already proposed an \r\nIslamic-Christian dialogue, which would be a first step \r\ntowards dialogue among peoples. We believe that if the \r\nleaders of the world meet together and make a real \r\nappeal for tolerance as a legacy from this generation to \r\nfuture generations, then we will have taken a step \r\nforwards towards understanding among the various \r\nreligions. This is absolutely essential to the \r\nestablishment of peace.  \r\n We know that Organization of Petroleum \r\nExporting Countries (OPEC) oligopoly increases the \r\nprice of oil as it wishes by manipulating supply — I \r\nknow this because I am an economist. I realize that it is \r\nthe law of the market, but the rest of us suffer from it. I \r\npropose that whenever OPEC increases the price of oil, \r\nit voluntarily add 2 per cent, but not as a tax: 1 per cent \r\nto combat poverty and 1 per cent to combat \r\nenvironmental degradation. Out of the $200 million of \r\nprofits from Africa, this would be at least $40 million \r\nand you won’t feel it more than you do just now, \r\nbecause a barrel which cost $29 in December 2003 \r\nnow costs over $81. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa.  \r\n Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of \r\nthe Republic of South Africa, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.  \r\n President Mbeki: Let me begin by adding my \r\nvoice to the many salutations directed to Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon on being elected as the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations. I wish him a fruitful tenure of \r\noffice, trusting that through his work the poor of the \r\nworld will have good reason to increase their \r\nconfidence in this Organization of the nations of the \r\nworld. \r\n Again, I reiterate the many thanks to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, for the good \r\nwork she did as the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-first session. Equally, my congratulations go \r\nto Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \r\n We meet here today, under the theme of \r\nresponding to climate change, at this session, which \r\nmarks the half-way point in the freely agreed period \r\nduring which the nations of the world committed \r\nthemselves to work, individually and collectively, to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Billions of the people of the world know as a \r\nmatter of fact that the consequences of climate \r\nchange — be it droughts, floods or unpredictable and \r\nextreme weather patterns — undermine our common \r\nefforts to achieve the MDGs. Today, we all understand \r\nthat the costs of doing nothing about climate change far \r\noutweigh those of taking concrete measures to address \r\nthis challenge. It is clear that delaying action on this \r\nmatter of climate change will hit poor countries and \r\ncommunities hardest. Yet the pace of climate change \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 10 \r\n \r\nnegotiations is out of step with the urgency indicated \r\nby science. \r\n I would therefore urge that we collectively aim \r\nfor a significant advance in the multilateral \r\nnegotiations when our negotiators meet in Bali in \r\nDecember this year. Together, we must ensure that we \r\nbuild a fair, effective, flexible and inclusive climate \r\nregime under the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, \r\nand we must agree to this as a matter of urgency. \r\nThough we have different responsibilities, and \r\ndeveloped countries clearly have an obligation to take \r\nthe lead, we all have a common duty to do more and \r\nact within our respective capabilities and in accordance \r\nwith our national circumstances. \r\n The World Summit on Sustainable Development \r\ncorrectly reaffirmed sustainable development as a \r\ncentral element of the global action against poverty and \r\nthe protection of the environment and identified \r\nimportant linkages between poverty, the environment \r\nand the use of natural resources. These linkages are \r\nreal to billions of the poor; the combination of their \r\nempty stomachs, their degraded environment and their \r\nexploited natural resources, for which they benefit \r\nnothing, defines hopelessness and a heart-wrenching \r\nexistence. \r\n Many of these wretched of the Earth know from \r\ntheir bitter experience how their resource-rich areas \r\nwere transformed into arid, uninhabitable and desolate \r\nareas forcing migration to better-endowed regions, thus \r\nexacerbating conflicts and the struggle for scarce \r\nresources. \r\n Gathered here as representatives of the peoples of \r\nthe world, we know very well that climate change, \r\npoverty and underdevelopment are not acts of God but \r\nhuman-made. \r\n Clearly, the starting point for a future climate \r\nregime must be equity. A core balance between \r\nsustainable development and climate imperatives will \r\nhave to be the basis of any agreement on a \r\nstrengthened climate regime. Any deal on fair use of \r\nthe ecological space will have to be balanced by a deal \r\ngiving all countries a fair chance in the development \r\nspace. \r\n Under the aegis of the United Nations, but also \r\nwithin our regional bodies, we have adopted many \r\nprogrammes and declarations, with clear \r\nimplementation targets aimed at addressing the \r\nchallenges of climate change, poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. As this conclave knows very well, \r\nthe many lofty agreements include, among others, \r\nthose adopted at the Rio Earth Summit, the \r\nCopenhagen Social Summit, the Millennium Summit, \r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development and the \r\nMonterrey International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. At all these summits and others, we have \r\nadopted declarations using moving and solemn words \r\nthat express our profound understanding of the gravity \r\nof the challenges facing the modern world and have \r\nunequivocally committed ourselves to defeating any \r\nand all of the miserable and dehumanizing conditions \r\nfacing large parts of humanity. \r\n Indeed, this collective asserted, in paragraph 11 \r\nof the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2):  \r\n  “We will spare no effort to free our fellow \r\nmen, women and children from the abject and \r\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. ... \r\nWe are committed to making the right to \r\ndevelopment a reality for everyone and to freeing \r\nthe entire human race from want.” \r\nYet the poor, whose hopes have been raised many times \r\nas we have made declaration after declaration against \r\npoverty and underdevelopment — and as we are doing \r\nnow on climate change — can be forgiven for thinking \r\nthat this important global leadership often sounds like \r\nan empty vessel.  \r\n That this collective is able to express, always \r\neloquently, the dire circumstances characterizing \r\npoverty is without doubt. However, this Organization, \r\nwhich should pride itself on visible actions and results \r\nin the fight against climate change and poverty, finds it \r\ndifficult to demonstrate decisive progress in that \r\nregard. The reasons for that are not hard to find. \r\nAlthough the concepts of freedom, justice and equality \r\nare universal and fully embraced by the United \r\nNations, this global Organization has not itself \r\ntransformed and designed necessary institutions of \r\ngovernance that are consistent with the noble ideals \r\nthat drive modern democratic societies. \r\n Because the nations of the world are defined by \r\nthe dominant and the dominated, the dominant have \r\nalways become the decision-makers in the important \r\nglobal forums, including at this seat of global \r\ngovernance. Accordingly, the skewed distribution of \r\nworld power — political, economic, military, \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n11 07-51584 \r\n \r\ntechnological and social — replicates itself in \r\nmultilateral institutions, much to the disadvantage of \r\nthe majority of the poor people of the world. \r\n Indeed, even as we agree on the important \r\nprogrammes that should bring a better life to the \r\nbillions of poor, the rich and the powerful have \r\nconsistently sought to ensure that, whatever happens, \r\nthe existing power relations are not altered and \r\ntherefore that the status quo remains. The results of \r\nthat situation are that the United Nations can and does \r\ncorrectly identify problems and appropriate solutions \r\nnecessary for making the world a better place for all of \r\nhumanity. Naturally, the dominant and the powerful \r\nvery often respond positively to agreed programmes if \r\nthese would advance their own narrow interests. \r\n At the same time, the poor will continue to strive \r\nfor improvement of their wretched conditions. They \r\ntherefore see the United Nations as a natural \r\ninstrument for helping to accelerate the process of \r\nchange for the better. Hence, they correctly see \r\nimplementation of all United Nations programmes as \r\nbeing central to the efforts relating to climate change \r\nand the struggle against poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n Yet the cold reality is that it will be difficult for \r\nthe United Nations, in its present form, to fully \r\nimplement its own decisions and therefore to help the \r\npoor to swiftly achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Indeed, until the ideals of freedom, \r\njustice and equality characterize this premier world \r\nbody itself, the dominant will forever dictate to the \r\ndominated, and the interests of the dominated — which \r\nare those of the majority of humanity — will be \r\ndeferred in perpetuity. Thus, noble statements will \r\ncontinue to be uttered on all matters facing the \r\nmajority of the people of the world, such as the need to \r\nsuccessfully conclude the Doha Development Round, \r\nwhile little is done to implement the many critical \r\nagreements necessary to pull the poor out of the morass \r\nof poverty and underdevelopment. \r\n We in my own country are of the firm belief that \r\nwe will achieve the MDGs. Having emerged from more \r\nthan three centuries of colonialism and apartheid, we \r\ninherited two interlinked economies, which we \r\ncharacterize as the first and second economies. The \r\ntwo economies — one developed and globally \r\nconnected and the other localized and informal — \r\ndisplay many features of a global system of apartheid. \r\nAs South Africans, we have sought to strengthen the \r\nfirst economy and to use it as a base for the transfer of \r\nresources to strengthen and modernize the second \r\neconomy, and thus embark on the process of changing \r\nthe lives of those who subsist in the second economy. \r\n Indeed, without the requisite resource transfers, it \r\nwill not be possible to achieve the MDGs, because our \r\nsecond economy cannot on its own generate the \r\nresources needed to bring a better life to millions of \r\npoor South Africans. I mention this because, as we all \r\naccept, central to the global attainment of the MDGs is \r\nthe critical matter of resource transfers from the rich \r\ncountries of the North to the poor countries of the \r\nSouth. \r\n Many developing countries — especially those of \r\nmy own continent, Africa — do not have the material \r\nbase from which to address and attain the MDGs on \r\ntheir own. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for \r\nmassive resource transfers through development \r\nassistance, investment, trade, technology transfers and \r\nhuman resource development to these poor countries if \r\nwe are to achieve the MDGs and successfully adapt to \r\nthe devastating impacts of climate change. \r\n If we do not succeed in building a climate change \r\nregime that balances adaptation and mitigation, \r\nunderpinned by the transfer of technology and financial \r\nresources, we will place an unmanageable burden on \r\nfuture generations. In that regard, given Africa’s \r\nspecific and dire challenges, we believe it is important \r\nto enter into a partnership with Africa using the African \r\nUnion’s programme the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which the Assembly has \r\nadopted, so that the measures that the continent has \r\nundertaken, with limited resources, for the regeneration \r\nof all the African countries can be strengthened by \r\nsupport from the international community, guided by \r\nthe programmes of the United Nations. \r\n As history teaches us, it was because of the \r\nmassive resource transfers in the aftermath of the \r\nSecond World War that Western Europe recovered and \r\nwas set on its development path. A similar intervention \r\nhelped to put a number of Asian countries on their own \r\ndevelopment trajectory. The question we should ask is, \r\nwhy is there an absence of the same resolve to assist \r\npoor nations today? The global village to which we \r\nconstantly refer should encourage us to expand human \r\nsolidarity. Thus, we would build a durable bridge over \r\nthe river dividing our common global village and \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 12 \r\n \r\nregrettably ensuring that one human being lives a \r\nfulfilling life while another experiences a miserable \r\nexistence. \r\n Representing the citizens of the world, we have \r\nset for ourselves programmes requiring that all of us \r\nwork together to create better living conditions for \r\nhumanity and ensure that we achieve that which is \r\nnecessary for our mutual prosperity. \r\n Together, rich and poor, developed and \r\ndeveloping, North and South, we can and must truly \r\nhold hands and address the challenges of climate \r\nchange and sustainable development, work together to \r\ndefeat poverty and underdevelopment and ensure that \r\nevery human being is saved from the indecencies and \r\nhumiliations that are inseparable from poverty. But to \r\ndo that, we need first and foremost to implement the \r\ndecisions that we have adopted freely in this eminent \r\nhouse of the representatives of the global community. \r\nAnd so, let our actions speak louder than our words.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President \r\nof the Argentine Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic. \r\n Mr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Kirchner (spoke in Spanish): Allow \r\nme at the outset to express my sincerest \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. Argentina welcomes the new \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and expresses its \r\nsupport for his efforts at the head of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n As in previous years, we have come to the \r\nGeneral Assembly with the aim of revitalizing this \r\nworld body and with the firm belief that this will \r\nensure the effectiveness of international law in settling \r\ndisputes, thus successfully dealing with any threats to \r\npeace.  \r\n The world is facing problems. The only hope we \r\nhave of resolving them lies in respect for \r\nmultilateralism, support for local customs, observance \r\nof international norms and conventions by all \r\ncountries, and, of course, the full realization of human \r\nrights. \r\n For each individual country, and for the world as \r\na whole, peace will be possible only if we promote \r\nequality and work to combat poverty and \r\nmarginalization. The world cannot and must not be a \r\nplace where violations of human rights are everywhere. \r\nPeaceful coexistence is strengthened and maintained \r\nthrough true solidarity between nations based upon a \r\nconcept of humanity that goes beyond the purely \r\nmilitary or the predominantly unilateral. \r\n Our international policy is based on the values of \r\nrepresentative democracy, sovereignty of the people, \r\nrespect for fundamental human rights, and the active \r\nupholding of international peace and security. Those \r\nprinciples are shared by the vast majority of the \r\nArgentine people. They help to focus the Government’s \r\nactivities and are reflected in the decisions taken by the \r\nArgentine Republic at the international level.  \r\n We firmly support the construction of more just \r\nand equitable societies that distribute more equitably \r\nthe benefits of economic growth. We know that each \r\ncountry must have the right to seek out its own \r\ndevelopment model, without external pressure. \r\n The past few years have been very testing for us. \r\nConsiderable efforts have been made to rescue a nation \r\nthat barely five years ago was in the throes of an \r\nunprecedented social and economic crisis. At the time, \r\nmany people thought that recovery might be \r\nimpossible. But day by day, with a great deal of effort \r\nand humility, we revived production in a country \r\nburdened by a foreign debt that threatened our future \r\nwith its conditions and constraints. \r\n Argentina — a developing country which once \r\ndemonstrated that it is truly possible to climb the social \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n13 07-51584 \r\n \r\nladder; a country of immigrants where workers once \r\nsucceeded in sending their children to university; a \r\ncountry once without illiteracy and having almost \r\nbanished child mortality — had been reduced to a \r\ncountry of workers demoralized by unemployment, \r\nchildren begging in the streets instead of going to \r\nschool, and the elderly living off miniscule pensions \r\nand becoming dependent on their children and \r\ngrandchildren. \r\n Our country’s coffers had been emptied owing to \r\nthe rigid application of the rules of the International \r\nMonetary Fund (IMF). As a corollary, there was \r\nviolence in the streets, and Argentina experienced an \r\ninstitutional crisis, with presidents lasting only days. \r\nFor the first time, Argentina sent off its own children \r\ninto an unprecedented economic exile.  \r\n Today the Argentine State has won its autonomy \r\nand itself administers the variables of its \r\nmacroeconomy as best it can in the current \r\ninternational environment. It pursues a sound, \r\ndisciplined and predictable economic policy within a \r\nstable and democratic framework.  \r\n Our capacity for revitalization has allowed us, \r\neven without receiving funding, to begin cancelling our \r\nnet debt with international organizations. We have even \r\npaid off in advance all of our debt with the IMF — an \r\nIMF that supported and promoted Governments that \r\nwere self-supporting, adjusting and patching up their \r\nbudgets, but at the cost of increasing the poverty of \r\ntheir people, promoting deindustrialization and \r\nirresponsibly plunging the country into debt.  \r\n Faced with the incredulous criticism of the \r\npromoters of orthodox prescriptions, Argentina, thanks \r\nto cautious monetary policies, disciplined public \r\nexpenditures and a healthy budget surplus that enabled \r\nit to face or mitigate potential foreign crises, has \r\nreduced the debt and registered an annual growth rate \r\nof 9 per cent during the past five years. This was the \r\nstrongest uninterrupted economic expansion of any in \r\nthe past 100 years.  \r\n Today we represent the empirical proof that there \r\nis life after the Fund and also the certitude that other \r\npaths can lead to development and integration. We \r\nserve as a reminder of the unreliability of models that \r\nclaim to be universally valid and the revindication of \r\nthe right of countries to choose their own path, \r\nbenefiting from international experience while \r\nprioritizing their national interests and circumstances \r\nabove any other interest. Our case provides proof that \r\nthe international economic architecture must be \r\nreformed, in particular that of IMF. The Fund is an \r\nexponent of an old world order that is no longer valid. \r\nOur case demonstrates the need for change in the \r\nmultilateral financial institutions so that they can \r\ncooperate in the development of the less-well-endowed \r\nnations and help to fight poverty and generate true \r\noptions for progress. \r\n We are thinking, not of economic growth as \r\ndefined by economic experts or historians, but of \r\ngrowth that has a strong social component and an \r\nemphasis on equity, where citizens are the focus of the \r\nresults. Whereas one fourth of the labour force \r\nexperienced the humiliation of being unemployed, \r\nunemployment has been reduced to 7.8 per cent since \r\nwe have taken office. We are speaking, not about just \r\nany sort of work, but about appropriate and decent \r\nwork of the kind we advocated at the most recent \r\nsummit meeting of the Americas, which was held in \r\nour country.  \r\n Thanks to a productive policy that generates \r\nadded value and, in addition, appeals to private \r\nenterprises to show social responsibility, we are \r\nreindustrializing Argentina. The economic indicators \r\nposted by our country today would have been \r\nimpossible were it not for the complementarity of \r\naction between the State and the private sector. \r\n Our sales to all destinations have doubled over \r\nthe past four years, with a 16 per cent annual growth \r\nrate. Investments have improved substantially: gross \r\ndomestic fixed investment has increased for the past 17 \r\nconsecutive quarters; the ratio of investment to GDP is \r\nbetween 20 and 23 per cent — in stark contrast to the \r\nlevel of 2002 when it was hardly more than 11 per \r\ncent.  \r\n When faced with that crisis almost five years ago, \r\nwe felt compelled to maintain essential assistance \r\npolicies for the most vulnerable segments of our \r\npopulation. We do not regret those policies, and today \r\nwe can state that the true solution to the serious social \r\nproblems affecting our country, and many others \r\naround the world, lies in providing jobs, health care \r\nand education.  \r\n In the area of health, Argentina has launched a \r\nnational policy that includes prescriptions for generic \r\ndrugs and the provision of essential medications free of \r\ncharge. It also strengthens maternity and child \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 14 \r\n \r\nprogrammes and everything that relates to primary \r\nhealth care, in line with the goals of equity and \r\nprotection. This has enabled us to compensate in part \r\nfor the disastrous state of the public health sector a \r\nshort time ago.  \r\n Of course, education is an essential element for \r\nrenewing the social and moral fabric of the nation, \r\neven though the time horizon for its effects to be felt is \r\nlonger than those of other public policies. In order to \r\nremedy the tragic situation that signalled the \r\nbreakdown of society and the failure on the part of the \r\nState to protect those who were most vulnerable, a new \r\nlaw on national education was passed. It will again \r\nfocus on ensuring equality of opportunity through \r\nguaranteed access to a quality education throughout the \r\nterritory that is linked to the labour market and \r\nincludes excellent training for teachers. Under the new \r\nlaw, a deadline of 2010 has been set, by which time \r\n6 per cent of the gross national product will be used to \r\nfinance education. \r\n In this context of steady recovery, Argentina’s \r\nforeign policy is being strengthened and expanded, \r\nwith a clear and decisive commitment to the national \r\ninterest. Regional integration is a priority. Over the \r\npast two decades, through the Common Market of the \r\nSouth (MERCOSUR), Argentina has strengthened its \r\ncommercial ties with the countries of the region. But \r\nits trade relations go far beyond the region. In that \r\nsense, multilateral negotiations within the World Trade \r\nOrganization are of particular importance because the \r\nliberalization of our agricultural sector — in which our \r\ncountry has clear competitive advantages — depends \r\non them, as does the adequate flexibility we need to \r\ncarry out our industrial policies.  \r\n More equitable and fairer rules in international \r\ntrade are of great importance to Argentina. We \r\ntherefore participate actively in multilateral economic \r\nnegotiations with the firm goal of achieving equity in \r\nthe norms that govern world trade and of reversing the \r\ndiscrimination erected against our main products \r\nthrough tariff barriers and other trade-distorting \r\ninstruments imposed by the developed countries. \r\n Argentina will be present in all multilateral \r\nforums, where we will participate to ensure more \r\nequitable and democratic rules. Multilateralism is the \r\nmost effective instrument for winning the battle against \r\nhunger, poverty, exclusion and environmental \r\ndegradation.  \r\n Everything I have said here is both cause and \r\nconsequence of institutional stability and respect for \r\nthe rule of law. The three pillars of the Argentine State \r\nare making decisions to combat impunity and preserve \r\nmemory, truth, and justice. We have begun bringing to \r\njustice those guilty of serious human rights violators. \r\nThose who imagined themselves having escaped with \r\nimpunity are fiercely resisting justice and, in an \r\nattempt to intimidate witnesses, have caused the \r\ndisappearance of one witness, Julio Lopez. They have \r\nthereby sent a dark message to a society that is seeking \r\nthe truth about the crimes against humanity which they \r\ncommitted, and that condemns such acts. \r\n Unconditional respect for human rights is our \r\nnew national paradigm. In the past, we were known \r\nthroughout the world for violations of those rights; \r\ntoday, as we strive to find the truth and to punish the \r\nguilty, we also seek to defend those rights worldwide.  \r\n Argentina, the Mothers and Grandmothers of the \r\nPlaza de Mayo in the monumental dignity of their \r\nstruggle, and the Argentine people have personally \r\nsuffered under the inefficiency of a broken multilateral \r\nhuman rights system. Their sole comfort were the very \r\nprecious humanitarian gestures of individuals, \r\norganizations and countries. While people were being \r\nkidnapped, tortured and killed in my country, the \r\nmechanisms established precisely to condemn and \r\nprevent such horrors remained silent. It is in their \r\nmemory, so that this will never happen again, that we \r\nsupport the new Human Rights Council and hope that it \r\nwill live up to the expectations of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n My Government has endorsed instruments of \r\ngreat importance, including the International \r\nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance, adopted by this Assembly on \r\n20 December 2006, which we signed in Paris on \r\n6 February. That instrument, along with the Convention \r\non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the \r\nOptional Protocol of the Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \r\nWomen, gives continuity and concrete form to a policy \r\nthat ascribes a central role to the promotion of human \r\nrights.  \r\n In our public policy, we now focus on \r\nenvironmental protection, but we know that there will \r\nbe no viable solution without cooperation among all \r\nthe countries of the world, the industrialized countries \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n15 07-51584 \r\n \r\nin particular, because the nature of the problem is of a \r\nglobal scale.  \r\n The issue of climate change should be of concern \r\nto all Governments, because no corner of the planet is \r\nunaffected by changes that have been identified as due \r\nto human activity. The Secretary-General’s convening \r\nof yesterday’s High-level Meeting was a timely \r\nmanifestation of the urgent need to strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation as an effective and adequate \r\nresponse to protect the environment and prevent the \r\nunacceptable exportation of pollutants to the \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n One after the other, various diplomatic efforts to \r\nhalt the violence in the Middle East once and for all \r\nhave failed, but we cannot merely throw up our hands. \r\nNo military solution will lead to peace and the \r\ntranquillity that all the peoples of the region so \r\ndesperately call for. The invasion of Iraq, which we \r\nrejected at the time it occurred, is the tragic and painful \r\nproof of the truth of our position. The Security Council \r\nand the nations of the Quartet have the heavy \r\nresponsibility of accompanying and, if possible, \r\nguiding a peace process that can succeed with courage \r\nand great perseverance. \r\n The Argentine Republic continues, year after \r\nyear, tirelessly to condemn the serious threat of \r\nterrorism throughout the world. We believe that all acts \r\nof terror are criminal and unjustifiable and that no \r\nargument can justify them. Just as no nation of the \r\nworld is beyond their reach, the response must be a \r\njoint effort of all nations, and especially this \r\nOrganization, to stop and eliminate this scourge. We \r\ncannot tolerate the actions of those responsible for \r\nterrorism or of those who defend, finance or protect \r\nterrorists, be they individuals or countries. \r\n Argentina has twice suffered terrorist attacks. The \r\nIsraeli embassy was attacked in 1992 and the AMIA \r\nheadquarters in 1994. Some 102 members of our \r\ncommunity, some of whose relatives are here with us \r\ntoday, lost their lives. Those victims, united by terror to \r\nthose of this city, those of Madrid, those of London, \r\nthose of Bali, those of Istanbul and those of many other \r\nplaces, impose upon us the moral mandate to respect \r\ntheir memories and to commit all our energies to \r\nhunting down, finding and prosecuting those \r\nresponsible. \r\n Despite the difficulties that have arisen through \r\nthe passage of time, given that those attacks took place \r\n13 and 15 years ago, respectively, and the subsequent \r\ncover-ups, our interest and the justice system continue \r\nto seek the truth, and we keep our memory of the \r\nhorror alive so that it will not recur. \r\n In November last year, the Argentine justice \r\nsystem called for international cooperation in the \r\napprehension of nine people suspected of having \r\ninitiated and planned the 18 July 1994 attack on AMIA, \r\nand the Executive Committee of INTERPOL \r\nunanimously recommended the apprehension of six \r\nIranian citizens and one Lebanese involved in the \r\naffair. We call here for that recommendation to be \r\nratified during the November session of the \r\nINTERPOL General Assembly. \r\n In that context, we hope that the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, in the context of applicable international law, \r\nwill accept and respect Argentina’s legal jurisdiction \r\nand cooperate effectively with Argentine judges to \r\nbring to justice those involved in these events. In that \r\nrespect, I wish to say here, at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters and before all the countries of the world, \r\nthat, unfortunately, the Islamic Republic of Iran has to \r\ndate failed to offer the required cooperation with the \r\nArgentine justice system to resolve those issues.  \r\n We call on the Secretary-General and on all the \r\nnations of the world to persuade the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran to allow the judicial process to move forward. \r\nWe do so with the sole aim of clarifying the facts and \r\nbringing those responsible to justice. Respect for the \r\nmemory of our 102 victims requires justice to be \r\ncarried out. We request the Islamic Republic of Iran to \r\ncooperate in the implementation of the norms of \r\ninternational law to allow us to come to nothing more, \r\nbut nothing less than the truth. \r\n Nations big and small, rich and poor, all \r\nthroughout the world will be highly vulnerable if we \r\nfail to grasp that action against terrorism requires \r\nurgent multilateral, intelligent and sustained action \r\nfirmly anchored in legitimacy, respect for individual \r\nrights, proportional response and respect for \r\ninternational public opinion. \r\n Efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction can count on the firm support and full \r\nparticipation of the Argentine Republic.  \r\n My country is known for the active role it plays \r\nin the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Argentina \r\ndevelops, consumes and exports nuclear energy for \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 16 \r\n \r\npeaceful purposes in the framework of the strictest \r\nrespect for the norms enshrined in the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \r\nnon-proliferation regime in its broadest sense.  \r\n Efforts to prevent proliferation are ethically and \r\nlegally correlated to progress on disarmament. Indeed, \r\nthe legal instruments on which the prohibition of \r\nweapons of mass destruction is based specifically on \r\nthe firm commitment not to develop new weapons of \r\nterror and destruction in the understanding that those \r\nwho possess such weapons will proceed to their \r\ngradual and effective elimination.  \r\n In recent years, we have seen disarmament \r\ncommitments permanently eroded. Nuclear arsenals \r\nremain disproportionately large and nuclear \r\ndisarmament agreements are in stasis. It should come \r\nas no surprise, then, that, given the situation, there are \r\nthose who question the legitimacy of pursuing \r\nunilateral advocacy for non-proliferation while solemn \r\ncommitments in the area of disarmament are ignored. \r\n Conventional weapons are responsible for the \r\ndeaths of millions of people around the world. Our \r\ncountry has given a high priority to initiatives \r\nassociated with the conclusion of an arms trade treaty. \r\nDomestically, we have initiated programmes for the \r\nvoluntary handover of firearms, the initial results of \r\nwhich have been encouraging.  \r\n The reform of the Security Council is still \r\npending. We are hoping for a reform that will make this \r\ncentral body more responsible, democratically \r\nrepresentative and dynamic. It will not, however, \r\nachieve this objective by creating new privileged \r\ncategories. We trust that the ongoing process of \r\nconsultations will be successful so that the Council can \r\nbe adapted to today’s world. \r\n Before concluding I wish to raise a matter of \r\ncontinuing importance to the Argentine Republic: the \r\nquestion of the Malvinas Islands, which include South \r\nGeorgia, South Sandwich and the maritime areas \r\nsurrounding those islands. This year, 174 years will \r\nhave passed since the British began to occupy this part \r\nof Argentine national territory. Ever since that act of \r\nforce in 1833, my country has protested against this \r\nillegal occupation and has demanded that the full \r\nexercise of its sovereignty be restored. \r\n We would also mention that 2007 marks the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the 1982 conflict in the \r\nSouth Atlantic, a conflict unleashed by the military \r\ndictatorship without the backing of the Argentine \r\npeople, who had always endeavoured to find a peaceful \r\nsolution to its legitimate sovereignty claim. \r\n The General Assembly has dealt with this matter \r\non many occasions, both prior to and since 1982. \r\nStarting in 1965, when the Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 2065 (XX), the Organization has recognized, \r\nyear after year, the existence of a sovereignty dispute \r\nbetween Argentina and the United Kingdom relating to \r\nthe question of the Malvinas Islands. It urged the two \r\nGovernments to negotiate, as soon as possible, a \r\npeaceful, just and lasting solution to the dispute, taking \r\ninto account the relevant resolutions of United Nations \r\nbodies and the interests of the people of the islands. \r\nThe ongoing and unrenounceable objective of \r\nregaining the full exercise of Argentine sovereignty \r\nover this part of our territory and the permanent \r\nreadiness of my country to resume negotiations aimed \r\nat finding a solution to the dispute have been reflected \r\nin our national Constitution. \r\n It is incomprehensible to us that the United \r\nKingdom should be unwilling to negotiate this matter, \r\nthereby violating the provisions of General Assembly \r\nresolution 2065 (XX) and numerous similar \r\nresolutions. \r\n The time has come for the United Kingdom to \r\nshoulder its responsibility and put an end to an \r\nanachronism: the illegal occupation for clearly colonial \r\npurposes of territory belonging to another State. \r\n My Government vigorously rejects the British \r\nclaim on the establishment of maritime areas \r\nsurrounding the archipelagos. In particular, it rejects \r\nthe recently divulged intention of the United Kingdom \r\nto make a submission to the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf — established by the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea — relative \r\nto the outer limits of the continental shelf of these \r\nArgentine territories.  \r\n In this, my last message to the General Assembly \r\nas the President of the people of Argentina, I wish to \r\nreaffirm our profound conviction that it is only through \r\ndemocracy, accompanied by freedom, social justice \r\nand peace, that man can realize his full potential. This \r\nAssembly of the peoples has a bounden duty to help \r\nensure that that will come to pass. \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n17 07-51584 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made.  \r\n Mr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran.  \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.  \r\n President Ahmadinejad (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I am pleased and \r\ngrateful to the Almighty to have the opportunity once \r\nagain to attend this important universal forum. \r\n In the present tumultuous world, loud outcries, \r\nthreats and tensions predominate. The big Powers are \r\nunable to solve present problems, and mistrust in \r\nregional and international arenas is on the rise. The \r\npsychological security of societies is targeted by an \r\nonslaught of political and propaganda designs; \r\ndisappointment prevails with regard to the efficacy of \r\nthe policies and actions of the international \r\norganizations in the establishment of durable peace and \r\nsecurity, and the protection of human rights is being \r\nweakened. I plan to touch upon and explain the roots of \r\nand solutions to these predicaments and some of the \r\nprincipal challenges facing our world. I will also speak \r\nto you about the need to remedy the present situation, \r\nabout prospects for a brighter and a more hopeful \r\nfuture and about the appearance of the sublime, about \r\nbeauty, compassion and generosity, about justice and \r\nthe blossoming of all God-given human talents and \r\nabout the prominence of faith in God and the \r\nrealization of the promise of God. I will then submit \r\nfor your judgement the question of Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme as a yardstick for the measurement of \r\nhonesty, efficacy, steadfastness and accomplishment. In \r\nthe closing part of my statement, I will offer my \r\nproposals. \r\n As you are all aware, mankind is currently facing \r\nimportant, numerous and diverse challenges. I will \r\nrefer to some of them. \r\n First, organized attempts to destroy the institution \r\nof family and to weaken the status of women. Family is \r\nthe most sacred and valuable human institution. It is \r\nthe centre of the purest mutual love and affection \r\nbetween mothers, fathers and children, provides a safe \r\nenvironment for the nurturing of human generations \r\nand serves as a fertile ground for the blossoming of \r\ntalent and compassion. This institution has been \r\nrespected in all times by all peoples, religions and \r\ncultures. Today we are witnessing an organized attack \r\nby the enemies and plunderers of humanity, who are \r\ntrying to destroy this noble institution by promoting \r\nlewdness and violence and by crossing the boundaries \r\nof chastity and decency. \r\n Womanhood, as the manifestation of divine \r\nbeauty and supreme kindness, affection and purity, has \r\nbeen heavily exploited in recent decades by the holders \r\nof power and the owners of media and wealth. In some \r\nsocieties, womanhood has been reduced to a mere \r\ninstrument of publicity, and all the boundaries and \r\nprotective shields of chastity, purity and beauty have \r\nbeen trampled. That is a colossal betrayal of human \r\nsociety and of future generations, and it is an \r\nirreparable blow to the pillar of social coherence, the \r\nfamily. \r\n I now turn to the issues of widespread violations \r\nof human rights, terrorism and occupation. \r\nUnfortunately, human rights are being extensively \r\nviolated by certain Powers — especially those who \r\npretend to be their exclusive advocates. Setting up \r\nsecret prisons, abducting persons, carrying out trials \r\nand secret punishments without any regard for due \r\nprocess, conducting extensive tapping of telephone \r\nconversations, intercepting private mail and issuing \r\nfrequent summonses to appear at police and security \r\ncentres have become commonplace and prevalent. \r\nThese Powers prosecute scientists and historians for \r\nstating their opinions on important global issues. \r\n They use various pretexts to occupy sovereign \r\nStates and cause insecurity and division, and then use \r\nthe prevailing situation as an excuse to continue their \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 18 \r\n \r\noccupation. For more than 60 years, Palestine, as \r\ncompensation for the loss that it incurred during the \r\nwar in Europe, has been under the occupation of the \r\nillegal Zionist regime. The Palestinian people have \r\nbeen displaced, are under heavy military pressure or \r\neconomic siege or are incarcerated under abhorrent \r\nconditions. The occupiers are protected and praised, \r\nwhile the innocent Palestinians are subjected to \r\npolitical, military and propaganda onslaughts. The \r\npeople of Palestine are deprived of water, electricity \r\nand medicine for the sin of asking for freedom, and the \r\nGovernment that was freely elected by the people is \r\ntargeted. Terrorists are being organized to attack the \r\nlives and property of people with the blessings of the \r\npoliticians and military officials of the great Powers. \r\n The brutal Zionists carry out targeted \r\nassassinations of Palestinians in their homes and cities, \r\nand terrorists are decorated with medals of peace and \r\nreceive support from the great Powers. On the other \r\nhand, they attract a number of Jews from various parts \r\nof the world by using false propaganda and by \r\npromising to provide them with welfare, jobs and food, \r\nand then settle them in the occupied territories, \r\nexposing them to the harshest restrictions, \r\npsychological pressures and constant threats. They \r\nprevent these people from returning to their homelands \r\nand, by coercion and propaganda, incite them to \r\nmalevolence towards the indigenous Palestinian \r\npeople. \r\n Iraq was occupied under the pretext of \r\noverthrowing a dictator and the existence of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. The Iraqi dictator, who had been \r\nsupported by the same occupiers, was disposed of, and \r\nno weapons of mass destruction were discovered, but \r\nthe occupation continues under different pretexts. No \r\nday passes by without people being killed, wounded or \r\ndisplaced, and the occupiers not only refuse to be \r\naccountable for and ashamed of their military \r\nadventure, but speak in a report of a new market for \r\ntheir armaments as a result of it. They even oppose the \r\nConstitution, the National Assembly and the \r\nGovernment established by the vote of the people, \r\nwhile not even having the courage to declare their \r\ndefeat and to leave Iraq. \r\n Unfortunately, we are witnessing the bitter truth \r\nthat some Powers do not value any nation or human \r\nbeing and that the only things that matter to them are \r\nthemselves and their political parties and groups. In \r\ntheir view, human rights amount to profits for their \r\ncompanies and their friends. The rights and the dignity \r\nof American people are also being sacrificed for the \r\nselfish desires of those holding power. \r\n I shall now discuss aggressions against \r\nindigenous cultures and national values. Culture is the \r\nmanifestation of identity, the key to the survival of \r\nnations and the foundation for their interaction with \r\nothers. In an organized movement, indigenous cultures \r\nthat are messengers of monotheism, love and fraternity \r\nare being subjected to broad and destructive \r\naggressions. National customs and values are being \r\nhumiliated, and the self-esteem and character of \r\nnations are being ridiculed and defamed. The purpose \r\nis to promote blind emulation, consumerism, \r\nscepticism towards God and human values and the \r\nplundering of the peoples’ wealth by great Powers. \r\n With regard to poverty, illiteracy, health-care \r\nissues and the gap between the rich and the poor, I \r\nshould like to say that, while a major part of the natural \r\nenvironment in Asia, Africa and Latin America is being \r\nplundered by the political and economic domination of \r\ncertain Powers, the situation of poverty and deprivation \r\nis alarming.  \r\n Let me draw the attention of the Assembly to \r\nsome data issued by the United Nations. Every day, \r\nnearly 800 million people go to bed hungry and about \r\n980 million suffer from absolute poverty, having less \r\nthan a dollar a day in purchasing power. People in \r\n31 countries — equivalent to 9 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation — have an average life expectancy of \r\n46 years, which is 32 years fewer than the average in \r\ndeveloped countries. The gap between the rich and the \r\npoor in some parts of the world has increased by \r\n40 times. In many countries, the majority of the people \r\nare deprived of access to education and schooling. In \r\ndeveloping countries, the rate of maternal mortality \r\nduring pregnancy is 450 per 100,000; that figure is 7 in \r\nthe richer nations. The infant mortality rate is 59 per \r\n1,000 live births for the developing countries and 6 for \r\nthe richer nations. One third of the deaths throughout \r\nthe world — or 50,000 deaths daily — result from \r\npoverty. I believe that those data clearly demonstrate \r\nthe tragic situation dominating economic interactions \r\nin the world. \r\n Next, I shall take up the forsaking of noble values \r\nand the promotion of deception and lies. Some Powers \r\nsacrifice all human values, including honesty, purity \r\nand trust, for the advancement of their goals. They \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n19 07-51584 \r\n \r\npropagate scepticism and deception in the relations \r\nbetween States and peoples. They lie openly, level \r\nbaseless charges against others, act in contradiction to \r\nlegal norms and damage the atmosphere of trust and \r\nfriendship. In their relations with others, they openly \r\nabandon morality and noble values, forsaking justice, \r\nrespect for others, love, affection and honesty for \r\nselfishness, supremacy, enmity and imposition. They \r\nsacrifice all the good things of life, including the \r\nsublime, for their own greed. \r\n I now turn to violations of rules of international \r\nlaw and disrespect for commitments. Some, who \r\nthemselves have drafted international law, openly and \r\neasily violate it and apply discriminatory policies and \r\ndouble standards to others. Having drafted \r\ndisarmament regulations, they daily test and stockpile \r\nnew generations of lethal weapons. Having helped to \r\nframe the Charter of the United Nations, they show \r\ndisrespect for the right of sovereign nations to self-\r\ndetermination and independence. They conveniently \r\nabrogate their formal treaties and do not yield to laws \r\nconcerning protection of the environment. Most of the \r\nviolations of international obligations are committed \r\nby a few global Powers. \r\n I will now talk about an escalation of threats and \r\nthe arms race. Some Powers, whenever their logic fails, \r\nsimply use the language of threats. The huge arms race \r\ncasts its menacing shadow over the entire globe. The \r\nnations of Europe were the victims of two world wars \r\nand a number of other devastating conflicts and were \r\nsubjected to the consequences of the cold war for many \r\ndecades. Today, Europeans are living under threat and \r\ntheir interests, security and lands are endangered \r\nbecause of the arms race carried on by certain big \r\nPowers. \r\n A bullying Power arrogates to itself the right to \r\nset up a missile system, poisons the life of the peoples \r\nof a continent and lays the ground for an arms race. \r\nSome rulers who superficially appear to be powerful \r\nactually believe that the tools they have at hand can be \r\nused at any time and for any purpose and, \r\nconsequently, threaten others and cast the shadow of \r\ninsecurity over nations and regions. \r\n International organizations and mechanisms \r\nclearly lack the capacity to overcome problems and \r\nchallenges, to put in place fair and just relations and \r\npeace, fraternity and security. There is hardly a \r\nGovernment or nation that really trusts these \r\nmechanisms to secure its rights or defend its \r\nindependence, territorial integrity and national \r\ninterests. \r\n There are many more challenges besides the ones \r\nI have enumerated. I know that I could have introduced \r\nmore had I wanted to touch upon them, but I chose to \r\nconfine myself to the ones I have stated. Now, the \r\nimportant and decisive question concerns the roots and \r\ncauses of these challenges. A scientific and careful \r\nanalysis shows that two fundamental factors account \r\nfor the present situation. Without a doubt, the first \r\nfactor is the relations arising from the consequences of \r\nthe Second World War. The victors of the war drew the \r\nroad map for global domination and formulated their \r\npolicies on the basis not of justice but of safeguarding \r\nthe interests of the victors over the vanquished nations. \r\nTherefore, for 60 years now, mechanisms arising from \r\nthis approach and related policies have been incapable \r\nof finding just solutions for global problems. Some big \r\nPowers still behave like the victors of the World War \r\nand regard other States and nations, even those that had \r\nnothing to do with the war, as the vanquished. They \r\nhumiliate other nations and make extortionate \r\ndemands. Their condescending ways are reminiscent of \r\nmedieval times and the old lord-serf relationship. They \r\nbelieve that they should have more rights than others \r\nand that they are not accountable to any international \r\norganization. \r\n Unfortunately, among all the ineffective bodies, \r\nthe United Nations Security Council ranks first; owing \r\nto circumstances in which some Powers with an \r\nexclusive and special right to the veto in the Security \r\nCouncil act as prosecutor, judge and executioner. It is \r\nnatural that countries that have been subjected to those \r\nPowers’ infringements of their rights have no hope of \r\ngetting what they deserve from the Council. \r\n Regrettably, humanity has witnessed that in all \r\nlong wars — like the Korean and Viet Nam wars, the \r\nwar of the Zionists against the Palestinians and against \r\nLebanon, the war of Saddam against the people of Iran \r\nand the ethnic wars of Europe and Africa — one \r\nSecurity Council member was one of the belligerents \r\nor supported one party, usually the aggressor, against \r\nthe other, or the conflict itself. \r\n Let us take a look at Iraq. They first occupied the \r\ncountry and then received authorization from the \r\nSecurity Council — the same Council in which the \r\nsame occupiers have the right of veto. Whom should \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 20 \r\n \r\nthe people of Iraq complain about, and where should \r\nthey take their complaints, in the hope of securing their \r\nrights? \r\n We saw in Lebanon that some Powers, for 33 \r\nlong days, prevented the Security Council from taking \r\nany action against the Zionist regime with the hope of \r\ngiving it time to achieve victory. Then, when they \r\nbecame disappointed at seeing their hopes unfulfilled, \r\nthey decided to put an end to the hostilities by adopting \r\na resolution. But the duty of the Security Council is to \r\nprevent the expansion of conflicts, to put ceasefires in \r\nplace and to promote peace and security. To whom and \r\nto what organization should the people of Lebanon \r\ncomplain? \r\n The presence of some monopolistic Powers has \r\nprevented the Security Council from performing its \r\nmain duty, which is the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security based on justice. The credibility of \r\nthe Council has been tarnished, and its efficacy in \r\ndefending the rights of United Nations Member States \r\nhas been undermined. Many nations have lost their \r\nconfidence in the Council. Some other mechanisms, \r\nsuch as monetary and banking ones, are in the same \r\nundesirable situation and have been turned into tools \r\nthat enable some Powers to impose their will on other \r\nnations. It is evident that these mechanisms are not \r\ncapable of responding to current needs, solving \r\nchallenges or establishing fair and sustainable \r\nrelations. \r\n Again, there is no doubt that the second and more \r\nimportant factor is that some big Powers disregard \r\nmorals, divine values, the teachings of the prophets and \r\nthe will of the Almighty. They allow the rule of the \r\nincompetent. How can the incompetent, who cannot \r\neven manage themselves and conduct their own affairs, \r\ngovern humanity and arrange its affairs? Unfortunately, \r\nthese people have put themselves in the position of \r\nGod. They are in servitude to their own whims, and \r\nthey desire to have everything for themselves. For \r\nthem, human dignity and the lives, property and \r\nterritories of others are no longer respected. For \r\ncenturies, humanity has had a deep wound inflicted on \r\nits tired body by impious Powers. Today, the problems \r\nthat people around the world face are mainly rooted in \r\ndisregard for human values and ethics, as well as in the \r\nrule of the selfish and the incompetent. \r\n The only sustainable approach to the betterment \r\nof humankind is a return to the teachings of the divine \r\nprophets, monotheism, respect for the dignity of \r\nhumans and the flow of love and affection in all \r\nrelationships, ties and regulations, and the reform of \r\npresent structures on this basis. To fulfil this objective, \r\nI invite everybody to form a front of fraternity, amity \r\nand sustainable peace, based on monotheism and \r\njustice, under the name of the Coalition for Peace, to \r\nprevent incursions and arrogance and to promote the \r\nculture of affection and justice. I hereby announce that, \r\nwith the help of all independent, justice-seeking and \r\npeace-loving nations, the Islamic Republic of Iran will \r\nbe heading down this path. \r\n Monotheism, justice and compassion for humans \r\nshould predominate in all the pillars of the United \r\nNations, and this Organization should be a forum for \r\njustice, where every member should enjoy equal \r\nspiritual and legal support. The General Assembly, \r\nrepresenting the international community, should be \r\nconsidered the most important pillar of the United \r\nNations and should, free from any pressure or threats \r\nby big Powers, take the required measures for the \r\nreform of the other United Nations structures including \r\nespecially the reform of the Security Council. It should \r\ndefine new structures based on justice and democracy, \r\nwith a view to becoming responsive to present \r\nrequirements and settling existing challenges, thereby \r\nbringing about enduring stability and security.  \r\n The nuclear issue of Iran is a clear example of \r\nhow such mechanisms perform and of the prevailing \r\nthoughts behind them. Members are all aware that Iran \r\nis a member of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) and has always observed its rules and \r\nregulations. It has had the most extensive cooperation \r\nwith that Agency in all areas. All our nuclear activities \r\nhave been completely peaceful and transparent. \r\n According to the Statute of the IAEA, every \r\nmember has a number of rights and obligations. In fact, \r\nall members have to stay on a peaceful path and, under \r\nthe supervision of the Agency, assist other members, \r\nand they are entitled to be supported by the Agency \r\nand have access to the fuel cycle with the help of the \r\nAgency and its members. \r\n Thus far, Iran has fulfilled all of its obligations \r\nbut has been deprived of other members’ technical \r\nassistance and, even at times, of the Agency’s support. \r\nFor about five years, some of the aforementioned \r\nPowers have, by exerting heavy pressure on the IAEA, \r\nattempted to prevent the Iranian nation from exercising \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n21 07-51584 \r\n \r\nits rights. They have derailed Iran’s nuclear issue from \r\nits legal tracks, and have politicized the atmosphere to \r\nimpose their wishes through taking advantage of all \r\ntheir potential. \r\n The Government of Iran spared no effort to build \r\nconfidence, but they were not satisfied with anything \r\nshort of the complete halt of all activities, even those \r\nrelated to research and university fields. They only \r\nsought to deprive the Iranian people of all their \r\ninalienable rights, even to the extent that centres not \r\ninvolved in the fuel cycle or not in need of supervision \r\nby the Agency were closed. \r\n After three years of negotiations and attempts to \r\nbuild confidence, the Iranian nation came to the firm \r\nbelief that the main concern of these Powers is not the \r\npossible deviation of Iran’s nuclear activities, but is to \r\nprevent its scientific progress under that pretext. If this \r\ntrend continues, there will be no possibility for Iran to \r\nenjoy its rights, not even in the next 20 years. \r\nTherefore, Iran decided to pursue the issue through its \r\nappropriate legal path, one that runs through the IAEA, \r\nand to disregard unlawful and political impositions by \r\nthe arrogant Powers. \r\n In the past two years, abusing the Security \r\nCouncil, the arrogant Powers have repeatedly accused \r\nIran and have even made military threats and imposed \r\nillegal sanctions against it. However, by the grace of \r\nfaith in God and national unity, Iran has moved \r\nforward step by step, and now our country is \r\nrecognized as one with the capacity for industrial-scale \r\nfuel cycle production for peaceful uses. Unfortunately, \r\nthe Security Council, in dealing with this obvious legal \r\nissue, was influenced by some bullying Powers and \r\nfailed to uphold justice and protect the rights of the \r\nIranian people. \r\n Fortunately, the IAEA has recently tried to regain \r\nits legal role as supporter of the rights of its members \r\nwhile supervising nuclear activities. We see this as a \r\ncorrect approach adopted by the Agency. Previously, \r\nthey illegally insisted on politicizing the Iranian \r\nnation’s nuclear case, but today, because of the \r\nresistance of the Iranian nation, the issue is back with \r\nthe Agency, and I officially announce that, in our \r\nopinion, the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed and has \r\nturned into an ordinary Agency matter. Today, many \r\nimportant questions have been raised about the nuclear \r\nactivities of certain Powers within the IAEA, which \r\nshould be dealt with properly. Of course, Iran has \r\nalways been, and will be, prepared to have constructive \r\ntalks with all parties. \r\n I would like to thank all the nations and countries \r\nthat, during this difficult period, defended the legal \r\nrights of my nation and motherland. I also want to \r\nexpress our appreciation to the members of the  \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, our friends in the Security \r\nCouncil and in the IAEA Board of Governors, the \r\ncommitted and law-abiding experts of the Agency and \r\nits Director General for standing by the law. I would \r\nalso like to announce that, unlike the monopolistic \r\nPowers, the Iranian nation is ready to offer to other \r\nmembers its experiences in the form of educational \r\nprogrammes, based on its obligations under the \r\nAgency’s Statute and under Agency supervision. \r\n Now I would like to address those who have \r\nshown hostility towards the Iranian nation for some \r\nfive years and who have offended and accused my \r\npeople, who have contributed to the history and \r\ncivilization of the world. I advise them to learn from \r\nhistory and their recent actions. They badly mistreated \r\nthe great Iranian nation, but they should be careful not \r\nto inflict the same on other members of international \r\norganizations, and not to sacrifice the dignity of \r\ninternational organizations for the sake of their \r\nunlawful wishes. Today the nations of the world are \r\nwide awake and resistant. If those Powers reform \r\nthemselves, the whole world will be reformed. Nations \r\nare inherently good and can coexist peacefully. \r\n Those Powers should endeavour to serve their \r\nown peoples; others do not need them. Is it not high \r\ntime for these Powers to return from the path of \r\narrogance and obedience to Satan to the path of faith in \r\nGod? Would they not like to be cleansed of their \r\nimpurities, submit to the will of God and believe in \r\nhim? Faith in God means believing in honesty, purity, \r\njustice and compassion for others. They can be certain \r\nthat they will benefit from purity, honesty, justice and \r\nloving and respecting human dignity. They can also be \r\ncertain that such values are, more and more, considered \r\nappropriate, valuable and beautiful by the nations of \r\nthe world. \r\n This is the invitation of all the divine prophets \r\nfrom Adam to Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and \r\nMohammed, peace be upon him. If they accept this \r\ninvitation, they will be saved, and if they do not, the \r\nsame calamities that befell the people of the distant \r\npast will befall them as well. According to the holy \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 22 \r\n \r\nQuran: “One who does not answer the divine call \r\nshould not think that he has weakened God on Earth; \r\nhe has no companion but God and he is clearly \r\nengulfed by darkness”. They have nothing of their own \r\nand cannot escape from the dominion of the rule of \r\nGod and his will. \r\n At this important gathering, I have to remind \r\nthem of the following words of the Almighty, which \r\nare mentioned in the Holy Quran:  \r\n “Do they not look at the powers and \r\nGovernments which came before them? If the \r\npeople of the past had actually possessed \r\nsomething, they would have kept it and would not \r\nhave let you possess it now. God destroyed them \r\nbecause of their sins, and nobody could protect \r\nthem against the will of God”. \r\n These Powers have to know that thoughts and \r\nmethods based on oppression and injustice are doomed \r\nto failure. Do they not see the signs of vigilance and \r\nresistance based on monotheism, philanthropy and the \r\njustice-seeking spirit of the nations of the world? Do \r\nthey not notice that we are nearing the sunset of the \r\ntime of empires? I hope that this invitation will have a \r\npractical answer. \r\n Peoples and Governments are not obliged to obey \r\nthe injustice of certain Powers. Those Powers, for the \r\nreasons already mentioned, have lost the competence to \r\nlead the world. I officially declare that the age of \r\nrelations arising from the Second World War and of \r\nmaterialistic thought based on arrogance and \r\ndomination is well over now. Humanity has passed a \r\nperilous precipice and the age of monotheism, purity, \r\naffinity, respect for others, justice and true peace-\r\nloving has commenced. \r\n It is the divine promise that the truth will be \r\nvictorious and the Earth will be inherited by the \r\nrighteous. Those who are free, believers and the people \r\nof the world should put their trust in God. Those who \r\ncrave lofty values, wherever they are, should try to \r\nprepare the grounds for the fulfilment of that great \r\ndivine promise by serving the people and seeking \r\njustice. \r\n The era of darkness will end, prisoners will return \r\nhome, the occupied lands will be freed, Palestine and \r\nIraq will be liberated from the domination of the \r\noccupiers, and the peoples of America and Europe will \r\nbe free of the pressures exerted by the Zionists. \r\nTenderhearted and humanity-loving Governments will \r\nreplace the aggressive and domineering. Human \r\ndignity will be regained. The pleasing aroma of justice \r\nwill permeate the world and people will live together in \r\na brotherly and affectionate manner. \r\n Striving in that way to surrender rule to the \r\nrighteous and perfect human, the promised one, is \r\nindeed the final cure for the wounds of humanity, the \r\nsolution of all problems, and the establishment of love, \r\nbeauty, justice and a dignified life throughout the \r\nworld. That belief and endeavour is the key to unity \r\nand constructive interaction among nations, countries, \r\nthe people of the world and all true justice-seekers. \r\nWithout a doubt, the promised one who is the ultimate \r\nsaviour, along with Jesus Christ and other holy \r\nprophets, will come. In the company of all believers, \r\njustice-seekers and benefactors, he will establish a \r\nbright future and fill the world with justice and beauty. \r\nThat is the promise of God; therefore it will be \r\nfulfilled. Let us play a part in the fulfilment of all that \r\nglory and beauty. \r\n I wish for a bright future for all human beings, \r\nthe dawn of the liberation of and freedom for all \r\nhumans, the rule of love and affection all around the \r\nworld, as well as the elimination of oppression, hatred \r\nand violence — a wish that I expect to be fulfilled in \r\nthe near future. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Indonesia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of the \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n23 07-51584 \r\n \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Yudhoyono: Let me begin by stating \r\nhow much I welcome and support the theme of this \r\nyear’s sixty-second session of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich is “Responding to climate change”. \r\n I stand here representing the good people of \r\nIndonesia, who are very eager to welcome \r\nrepresentatives to the Bali conference in December this \r\nyear. When they come to our country, they will see a \r\ngreat nation whose multi-ethnic and multi-religious \r\npeople live in harmony with one another and in \r\nharmony with mother Earth, the way they have for \r\nthousands of years. \r\n Indonesia is a country that has felt and suffered \r\nthe effects of climate change. In recent years, we have \r\nbeen hit by a series of natural disasters in the form of \r\nfloods, drought, forest fires, El Niño, tsunamis and \r\nearthquakes. The issue of climate change has made us \r\nsee interdependence in a completely new light. When it \r\ncomes to global warming, we are much more \r\ninterdependent than we thought in terms of the causes, \r\nsymptoms and solutions. \r\n We must uphold the principle of common and \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective \r\ncapabilities, but there is always room for every \r\ncountry, every community and every individual to be \r\nmore flexible, more innovative and more inclusive. \r\n A persistent theme in our discussions on climate \r\nchange yesterday was the need for urgency, which \r\nmeans the need for action and the need to think outside \r\nthe box. I count myself as an optimist who sees today a \r\nlarger window of opportunity to strike a global \r\nconsensus to tackle global warming. \r\n We will have that chance in Bali. The Bali \r\nconference must yield a new road map on climate \r\nchange, and that new road map must spell out what \r\nmust be done by both the developed and the developing \r\nworlds to save humankind and its planet from the \r\nlooming tragedy of climate change. It must link the \r\nsolution to the problem of climate change with \r\nsustainable development — the conquest of poverty. It \r\nmust produce an outcome and timeline that will be \r\nmore comprehensive and more ambitious in achieving \r\nits practical objective of reducing greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. \r\n We developing countries must protect our natural \r\nresources while using them wisely for development. \r\nAmong the most valuable of our natural resources are \r\nour forests. From them, we extract economic wealth; \r\nthrough them, we store an immense volume of carbon \r\nthat would otherwise pollute the atmosphere. \r\n On that basis, yesterday Indonesia took the \r\ninitiative of launching a special leaders’ meeting of \r\ntropical rainforest countries. At that meeting, we \r\nleaders of the countries having custody of a great \r\nportion of the world’s rainforests decided to intensify \r\nour cooperation in forest conservation and \r\nreforestation. \r\n We also believe that countries that seek to \r\nenhance their carbon sinks — through forestation, \r\nafforestation and avoided deforestation — should be \r\ngiven incentives and rewarded fairly for doing so. \r\n Throughout our deliberations on climate change, \r\nlet us always keep an eye on the requirements of \r\ndevelopment. That means we must not lose sight of the \r\nimperative to conquer poverty as a basic problem of \r\nthe human condition.  \r\n In Indonesia we have a national dream, which is \r\nreflected in our 1945 Constitution. We dream that we \r\nand our future generations can enjoy the blessings of \r\npeace, freedom, justice and prosperity. And we dream \r\nof seeing to it that the same blessings are enjoyed by \r\nthe rest of humankind. Poverty can kill that dream.  \r\n That is why the new Indonesia of today is fully \r\ndedicated to the fight against poverty. For that purpose, \r\nour national economic policy is focused on the \r\ndevelopment of rural areas, where the vast majority of \r\nour people live and where they wage a daily struggle \r\nagainst the ravages of poverty. That is why we are so \r\nintent on making the national business climate friendly \r\nand attractive to foreign direct investment, so that jobs \r\nwill be created for our millions of unemployed people. \r\nThat is why we are so intent on eradicating the taint of \r\ncorruption from our society. And that is why our \r\nforeign policy addresses the need for a truly \r\nfunctioning global partnership for development, \r\nbecause only such a partnership can ultimately conquer \r\nthe basic problem of poverty. \r\n Peace in the Middle East is crucial to long-term \r\nglobal stability. But there can be no peace in the \r\nMiddle East unless there is justice, especially justice \r\nfor the Palestinian people. A divided Palestinian nation \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 24 \r\n \r\ncannot secure justice. Hamas and Fatah must therefore \r\nengage in dialogue and reconcile their agendas. The \r\nArab initiative must catalyse political change in the \r\nregion. \r\n Indonesia has a long history of participating in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations that dates \r\nback to the Suez conflict, in 1956. We are taking part \r\nin the operation in Lebanon today. We are determined \r\nto maintain that proud tradition of involvement in \r\nglobal concerns. That, I believe, is what humankind \r\nneeds most today, namely, the involvement of \r\neveryone. There must be a global partnership at work. \r\nDeveloped and developing countries must work \r\ntogether with a greater sense of partnership and of \r\nurgency. \r\n Therefore, to solve the problem of climate change \r\nthe Bali Conference must set the stage for a genuine \r\npartnership between developed and developing \r\ncountries and all other stakeholders. Developed \r\ncountries must extend support while developing \r\ncountries strive to protect and enhance their \r\nenvironment and its biodiversity. They must lighten the \r\nburden of developing countries in carrying out that \r\nimmense task — through incentives and the transfer of \r\nenvironmentally sound technology. \r\n While developing countries are in hot pursuit of \r\ntheir Millennium Development Goals, the developed \r\nworld can greatly help ensure the success of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round. Developed countries must ensure \r\nsufficient flows of financing for development through \r\nforeign direct investment and official development \r\nassistance. They must facilitate the transfer of \r\ntechnology for development. \r\n We in the developing world, on the other hand, \r\nmust prudently manage our natural and human \r\nresources. We must practise good governance. We must \r\nfight corruption at all levels so that our resources will \r\nnot be wasted. We must see to it that the human rights \r\nof our citizens are promoted and protected. \r\n No partnership works without teamwork, and no \r\nteamwork is possible without constant effective \r\ncommunication. That means dialogue. After all, \r\ndialogue is the best way to exercise soft power. \r\nDialogue and soft power can greatly advance the cause \r\nof disarmament and non-proliferation. Dialogue and \r\nsoft power have helped resolve various intra-State \r\nconflicts — including in Aceh, where two years ago we \r\nreached a peaceful political settlement that \r\npermanently ended the conflict. Dialogue and soft \r\npower can also be a major instrument in addressing the \r\nroot causes of terrorism.  \r\n That is why I am a firm advocate of dialogue \r\namong faiths, cultures and civilizations. I urge that the \r\ndialogue in the Alliance of Civilizations be fully \r\nintegrated into the work of the United Nations. Sincere \r\ndialogue can lead to the formation of an effective \r\nglobal partnership on climate change, which is also a \r\npartnership for sustainable development. I look \r\nforward to such a dialogue taking place at the Bali \r\nConference this coming December. That will be a \r\nvitally important dialogue, for it can set off a chain of \r\nevents that will lead to the fulfilment of the dream of \r\nbillions for a safer, better life. It will certainly add \r\nsheen to the national dream of Indonesia — our \r\ncommon dream — for a better world of peace, social \r\njustice and equitably shared prosperity. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Indonesia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Martín Torrijos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama. \r\n Mr. Martín Torrijos, President of the Republic of \r\nPanama, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. \r\nMartín Torrijos, President of the Republic of Panama, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Torrijos (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof my country, and on my own behalf, I would like to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Kerim on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at the sixty-second \r\nsession. I should also like to commend Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his encouraging message this \r\nmorning (see A/62/PV.4). \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n25 07-51584 \r\n \r\n The Charter of the United Nations has been the \r\nsubject of revisions almost from the moment it entered \r\ninto force. Some of those changes were successful and \r\ntimely. However, today we are acting too slowly in \r\nadapting United Nations structures to the realities of \r\nthe twenty-first century, despite the fact that the \r\nMillennium Development Goals have given it new \r\nvigour and almost a new raison d’être. Although there \r\nseems to be broad agreement to strengthen the General \r\nAssembly and to make the Security Council more \r\nrepresentative and transparent, we are spending too \r\nmuch time trying to decide how to do it. \r\n Panama has been very clear in its support for the \r\naspirations of Brazil, Japan and Germany to become \r\npermanent members of the Security Council. But we \r\nhave also deemed it appropriate to offer Member States \r\nalternatives that would enable us to make progress in \r\nthis debate. We urge an open mind so that we can \r\ncomplete this debate and come up with the relevant \r\nchanges quickly. \r\n Panama became a Security Council member with \r\na great feeling of regional solidarity and fiduciary \r\nresponsibility vis-à-vis the international community on \r\nall matters relating to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. We are grateful for the confidence \r\nthat the General Assembly placed in my country, and \r\nwe are always ready to seek agreement between parties \r\nto a conflict and to help remove obstacles that stand in \r\nthe way of peace and agreements. To that end, we have \r\nencouraged and supported efforts to advance \r\ndemocratic institutions and the rule of law, the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights and \r\nhumanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced \r\npersons. \r\n No conflict in the world has been given greater \r\nattention by the international community than that in \r\nthe Middle East region. Although agreements have \r\nbeen arrived at that have eased tensions, the path \r\ntowards peace has always been elusive, and new \r\nobstacles arise all the time. The conflict between Israel \r\nand Palestine is at the very core of the problems in the \r\nregion. Panama therefore encourages and promotes \r\nnegotiations between the parties, geared towards \r\ncreating a Palestinian State that can live in peace with \r\nthe State of Israel, with secure borders for both. This \r\nwill require a cessation of attacks on Israel from Gaza, \r\nwithdrawal from all the occupied territories in the West \r\nBank and the achievement of an agreement about the \r\nstatus of Jerusalem that would satisfy the parties \r\ndirectly involved and the entire international \r\ncommunity. \r\n On the situation in Lebanon, it is important for \r\nthe international community to realize that a lasting \r\npeace in the region requires the establishment of a \r\ngovernment of unity which can end the current \r\npolitical deadlock. If it is not resolved, this could lead \r\nto a return to civil war, which is something that we all \r\nthought was now over and done with. \r\n From this rostrum, we join in the call for an \r\nimmediate reduction in tension and peaceful solutions \r\nin all parts of the world where international peace and \r\nsecurity are threatened. It is much less costly to invest \r\nour efforts in avoiding confrontation than to stop it \r\nonce it has begun. Accordingly, we appeal to this \r\nOrganization to reconsider its actions vis-à-vis the \r\nconflict in the Middle East which, far from being \r\nresolved, seems to be intensifying. \r\n Turning to the dispute between Serbia and the \r\nKosovar Albanians, today we can be cautiously \r\noptimistic that, after several months of Security \r\nCouncil debate, which included a visit to the region, \r\nthe parties have agreed to resume dialogue. Only an \r\nagreement between them can ensure peace and \r\neconomic development in the region. \r\n Panama strongly supports the renewal and \r\nextension of the mandate of the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti. We recognize the \r\nprogress made by the Haitian Government with support \r\nfrom that mission. However, there are many matters \r\nthat still require more efforts, and it is essential that the \r\nmandate not end before that country’s institutions have \r\nbeen strengthened. \r\n We welcome the progress made, but we must \r\ncondemn the violation of human rights in Myanmar \r\nand the continued detention of Nobel Peace Prize \r\nlaureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Although every conflict \r\nhas its own particular causes, we can say that \r\nviolations of the human rights of certain groups, a \r\nculture of impunity or the absence of strong institutions \r\nable to guarantee the human rights of all are the \r\ncommon denominator of most conflicts. \r\n In Africa, there are examples of how institutional \r\nweakness and abuses of human rights become the main \r\ncauses of conflict. On the initiative of the President of \r\nFrance, the Security Council is meeting this very \r\nafternoon to analyse all the problems that afflict that \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 26 \r\n \r\ncontinent (see S/PV.5749). It is only by strengthening \r\ninstitutional capacity and building a culture of justice \r\nthat it will be possible to restore to those peoples the \r\nrights that this Organization enshrined for all \r\ninhabitants of the Earth. \r\n Responsibility for solving disputes and \r\npreventing conflict lies primarily with the States \r\nparties to a dispute. However, achieving peace depends \r\nto a large extent on our commitment to the collective \r\nsecurity architecture that we have built here in the \r\nUnited Nations. Since the end of the cold war, the \r\nUnited Nations has responded to the major challenges \r\nto international peace and security by increasing the \r\nnumber and the quality of peacekeeping operations in \r\ncases where diplomacy has failed. To avoid a return to \r\nconflict situations, peacekeeping operations cannot be \r\nconfined to simply separating rival forces. It is \r\nessential to strengthen the concept of integrated \r\nmissions to include new responsibilities that cover a \r\nbroader range of activities. Achieving a lasting peace \r\nmeans more than simply laying down one’s weapons. \r\nOne must set off on the path towards development; \r\nlegal and political institutions must be rebuilt and \r\nhuman rights must be respected. \r\n We cannot talk about lasting peace while we live \r\nunder the threat of terrorism, whose definitive defeat is \r\nan ongoing challenge for the international community. \r\nPanama supports United Nations efforts to combat this \r\nscourge in an integrated manner, such as the adoption \r\nof the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy (see resolution 60/288). And, because we \r\nattach high priority to the adoption of a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism, we have \r\nshouldered the responsibility of chairing the Security \r\nCouncil’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. \r\n The adoption of the Convention on the Rights of \r\nPersons with Disabilities (see resolution 61/106) was a \r\nmajor milestone on the path towards a world without \r\nexclusionism and reaffirmed the universality of human \r\nrights. Specific measures have been defined to \r\nguarantee full participation. Above all, we have \r\ncategorically said that discrimination against any \r\nperson on the basis of disability is a violation of the \r\ninherent dignity and worth of the human person. I \r\nwould like to say that Panama has made significant \r\nprogress in this area; inclusive education is a State \r\npriority. We have signed the Convention, and we are \r\ncommitted to implementing it. \r\n Of particular importance to Panama is the recent \r\nadoption of a declaration on indigenous peoples for the \r\nLatin American region. It strengthens respect for \r\ncultural diversity, with emphasis on preserving cultural \r\nassets. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n A year ago, I told the General Assembly (see \r\nA/61/PV.12) that my country would hold a referendum \r\nto decide whether to undertake the work of widening \r\nthe Panama Canal so that larger ships could transit \r\nbetween the two great oceans. As I believe is generally \r\nknown, the people of Panama approved the project, and \r\nbarely three weeks ago the work began. It will be \r\ncompleted by the year 2014. \r\n Panama, which has always contributed to the \r\ndevelopment of international trade and to \r\nunderstanding among nations, is especially pleased to \r\nreaffirm that unifying mission today, as well as its \r\ncommitment to peace, development and full respect for \r\nhuman rights. \r\n I should like to conclude my statement by \r\nreferring to some words spoken from this same rostrum \r\nby a Panamanian more than 50 years ago and that are \r\nstill just as true today. He said that to attempt to \r\npreserve peace without at the same time improving \r\npeoples’ living conditions is to leave the task \r\nunfinished and inconclusive. We should not tire of \r\nrepeating that the most serious threats to peace and \r\nfreedom are rooted in human poverty, social injustice, \r\nignorance and economic backwardness; and that the \r\nonly peace worth keeping and defending, and which \r\ncan be lasting, is peace with honour, justice and \r\nfreedom. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Panama for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Martín Torrijos, President of the Republic of \r\nPanama, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n27 07-51584 \r\n \r\n Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and to invite him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n President Karzai: Over the 62 years of its \r\nexistence, the General Assembly has witnessed many \r\nmoments of historical reckoning. It was one such \r\nmoment, five years ago, when Afghanistan returned to \r\nthe Assembly as a country emerging out of a long, dark \r\nera of war, violence and terror. As I stood before the \r\nAssembly in September 2002, the challenges of \r\nrestoring security to the lives of the Afghan people and \r\nof rebuilding Afghanistan into a stable and democratic \r\ncountry seemed all but insuperable. The fate of a \r\nnation swayed between the promise of a safer and more \r\nprosperous future, on the one hand, and the enormity of \r\nthe tasks, on the other hand. \r\n Today, efforts in support of stability and \r\nreconstruction in Afghanistan are proceeding resolutely \r\napace. The Afghan people continue to make the best of \r\nthe new opportunities. Our economy is surging ahead. \r\nThe legitimacy of our newly founded institutions is \r\ngradually taking root. Our society is brimming with \r\nfreedom and activity. \r\n For too long, Afghanistan was in an unenviable \r\nposition in terms of most human development \r\nindicators. That situation is no longer acceptable, and \r\nis changing rapidly. Today more Afghans enjoy access \r\nto health and education than ever before in our history. \r\nWe have very fortunately cut our child mortality rate, \r\nwhich was one of the highest in the world just two \r\nyears ago, by 25 per cent. As a result, over 85,000 \r\nmore children have a chance to live today. \r\n For the first time in 40 years, Afghanistan is set \r\nonce again to become self-sufficient in food \r\nproduction. Already, the fruits of relative stability and \r\nincreased prosperity in Afghanistan are spilling over \r\nthe borders to the wider region. Having enjoyed \r\nunprecedented growth in our regional trade over the \r\npast six years, we are now moving to consolidate \r\nAfghanistan’s role in the economic integration of the \r\nregion. Earlier this year, we assumed membership of \r\nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \r\n(SAARC). The significance of that step lies in the \r\npotential for Afghanistan to connect South Asia to \r\nCentral Asia and the Middle East in commerce and \r\ninteraction.  \r\n Last month, President Rahmon of Tajikistan and I \r\nwere joined by the United States Secretary of \r\nCommerce to inaugurate a transit bridge financed by \r\nthe United States that connects Afghanistan with \r\nTajikistan and beyond. That bridge, alongside many \r\nother infrastructure projects we have completed, is to \r\nplay a significant role in the further economic \r\nintegration of the region. \r\n Make no mistake: despite our achievements, a \r\nsafer and brighter future for Afghanistan still hinges on \r\nmany serious challenges. Poverty, underdevelopment, \r\nclimatic hardships and, above all, the menaces of \r\nterrorism and narcotics, are challenges of global \r\nproportions that continue to be shared by Afghanistan \r\nas a member of the global village. \r\n To the extent that terrorism remains a threat, \r\nworld citizens will never be safe. Six years after \r\nAfghanistan’s liberation from the grip of international \r\nterrorists, we are still grappling with this threat on a \r\ndaily basis. Terrorists continue to kill innocent people, \r\nincluding those who have come from the outside world \r\nto help. The past two years have witnessed a \r\nsignificant increase in terrorist attacks carried out with \r\nnew and brutal tactics such as beheadings, kidnappings \r\nand the burning of schools and clinics. \r\n Terrorism can only be overcome if it is addressed \r\nappropriately across its regional and international \r\ndimensions. We are monitoring with deep concern the \r\ncontinued presence of a terrorist infrastructure in our \r\nregion, and condemn, in equally strong terms, the \r\natrocities that terrorists are committing in places \r\nbeyond our borders.  \r\n Recognizing that constructive regional \r\ncooperation is vital to a successful counterterrorism \r\nstrategy, we proposed the holding of a joint jirga, or \r\ncouncil, between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are \r\npleased with the support that that initiative has \r\nreceived from our friends in the international \r\ncommunity. The first joint peace council between \r\nAfghanistan and Pakistan was held in Kabul last \r\nmonth. It was a promising step in harnessing the \r\nunequivocal support of civil societies in both countries \r\nin our common fight against terrorism and extremism. \r\nWe expect that the outcome of the council will \r\ntranslate into concrete action. \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 28 \r\n \r\n While we continue our struggle against terrorism, \r\nwe will also focus on reconciliation with those that are \r\nnot part of Al Qaida and other terrorist networks.  \r\n I also note, with deep concern, the particularly \r\nheinous use by terrorists of local populations as human \r\nshields, resulting in the loss of civilian lives. While \r\ncondemning such deliberate targeting of civilians in the \r\nstrongest possible terms, I would like to emphasize the \r\nneed for maximum caution on the part of the \r\ninternational forces operating in Afghanistan, as well \r\nas for increased coordination with Afghan authorities, \r\nin order to avoid civilian casualties. \r\n Narcotics is another global peril that, like \r\nterrorism, seriously undermines the stability and well-\r\nbeing of our societies. In Afghanistan, that scourge is \r\nthe legacy of the decades of misfortunes that befell our \r\ncountry — from the widespread despair induced by war \r\nand oppression, to drought and climatic hardships. We \r\nare working with our international partners to tackle \r\nthe menace. We will prioritize the provision of \r\nalternative livelihoods to farmers and expedite \r\nimplementation of other strategies, including poppy \r\neradication and the interdiction of traffickers. \r\nHowever, addressing the world’s drug challenge must \r\ninvolve focus on the far greater dimensions of the drug \r\ntrade that lie outside Afghanistan, such as fighting the \r\ninternational drug mafia, ensuring stricter border \r\ncontrol, and reducing demand in foreign markets. \r\n Climate change has rightly been recognized as a \r\nserious challenge facing the entire world. No country, \r\ndeveloped or developing, is immune to its impact. \r\nYesterday’s high-level event on that important topic \r\nwas an essential step forward in strengthening the \r\nresolve of the international community to address that \r\nglobal threat with unity. We fully support the \r\nrecommendations of the Chairman’s summary. \r\n We are also watching the situation in the Middle \r\nEast with deep concern. In particular, we remain \r\nconcerned about the situation in Palestine and call for \r\nthe full realization of the rights of our Palestinian \r\nbrothers and sisters, including their right to an \r\nindependent State, living side by side with its \r\nneighbours in peace and coexistence.  \r\n The adoption of the Iraq Compact, sponsored by \r\nthe United Nations and the international community, \r\nwas an achievement marking Iraq’s new partnership \r\nwith the international community to consolidate peace \r\nand promote social and economic development. We, \r\nthe Afghan people, wish our brothers and sisters in Iraq \r\nevery success in achieving their aspiration of a \r\npeaceful and prosperous Iraq. \r\n Allow me to thank our partners in the \r\ninternational community, the United States, Japan, \r\nmembers of NATO, the European Union, our brothers \r\nin the Islamic world, our neighbours, China, India, \r\nAustralia and all other countries for supporting \r\nAfghanistan during these years of challenge to our \r\ncountry. We appreciate the role that the United Nations \r\nand the Secretary-General are playing in coordinating \r\nthe international community’s role in the development \r\nprocess in Afghanistan. I am particularly thankful to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his initiative, two \r\ndays ago, of calling a high-level international meeting \r\non Afghanistan, at which our partners once again \r\nreaffirmed their commitment to Afghanistan’s \r\nrebuilding and reconstruction. \r\n Six years ago, in an unprecedented convergence \r\nof interests, the international community united behind \r\nAfghanistan, facing up to the inescapable reality that \r\nthe world’s security had come to depend on stability \r\nand progress in Afghanistan. Today, many of the \r\nnations represented here can rightly take pride in what \r\nwe have achieved together. I thank them all for their \r\ncommitment and for the steadfast support they have \r\nprovided to Afghanistan over the past six years. \r\nWithout that support, the progress we have made in \r\nAfghanistan would be simply unthinkable. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the \r\nSlovak Republic \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Slovak Republic. \r\n Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n29 07-51584 \r\n \r\nof the Slovak Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Gašparovič (spoke in Slovakian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Allow me, \r\nSir, to congratulate you on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I \r\nbelieve that, under your presidency, this Organization \r\nwill make further progress in its reforms, enabling it to \r\nrespond promptly to the challenges faced by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n From the outset, I would like to thank your \r\npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \r\nefforts in performing the challenging tasks on the \r\nagenda of the sixty-first session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The Slovak Republic fully aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Portugal \r\non behalf of the European Union. In addition, I wish to \r\nmake a contribution to the general debate on behalf of \r\nthe Slovak Republic. \r\n In spite of notable progress in some areas, the \r\nSlovak Republic is not satisfied with the current pace \r\nand scope of the United Nations reform process. We \r\nthink it necessary to make the work of newly created \r\nstructures and institutions more dynamic and to prepare \r\nthe United Nations to ensure the targeted prevention \r\nand solution of concrete problems and conflicts. \r\n We appreciate the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We hope that it will \r\nbecome a pivotal tool in post-conflict stabilization. It \r\nshould give the international community a vehicle for \r\nsolving issues that extends the scope of crisis \r\nmanagement. \r\n Slovakia also encourages efforts towards overall \r\nreform in the system of human rights protection. We \r\nhave welcomed the commencement of work by the \r\nHuman Rights Council and recognize its primary \r\nresponsibility for promoting universal respect for the \r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nWithin the ongoing process of institutional changes, we \r\nexpect the Council to effectively enforce its mandate \r\npursuant to resolution 60/251. The Slovak Republic \r\nendorses the concept of protecting and promoting \r\nhuman rights at the national and international levels. In \r\nthat context, we are prepared to assume our share of \r\nresponsibility. We will be honoured to receive the \r\nsupport of other United Nations Member States for the \r\ncandidacy of the Slovak Republic to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for 2008-2011 in the election scheduled for \r\nspring 2008. \r\n The Slovak Republic appreciates the measures \r\ndesigned to reform the Secretariat. We support the \r\nmodernization of the Secretariat’s management system \r\nso that it can flexibly respond to current needs and \r\nchallenges, and the strengthening of its accountability \r\nfor the implementation of its tasks. As a country \r\nparticipating in several United Nations-led \r\npeacekeeping missions, we have also expressed our \r\nsupport for the restructuring of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations. \r\n United Nations reform cannot be complete \r\nwithout also reforming the structure and working \r\nmethods of the Security Council. Slovakia has been \r\nactively engaged in this reform effort during the term \r\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council. \r\nThe membership of that United Nations body should \r\nreflect the changed geopolitical reality. The number of \r\nboth permanent and non-permanent Council members \r\nshould increase and the Global South countries should \r\nacquire more seats. Germany and Japan have our \r\nexplicit support in their ambition to become new \r\npermanent members of the Council. As a small country, \r\nwe also support those proposals for the non-permanent \r\nmembership category that would restrict countries from \r\nso-called “flip-flopping” between categories.  \r\n Nor may the General Assembly evade the reform \r\neffort. It is necessary to strengthen its role and \r\nauthority by focusing the Assembly’s attention on real \r\nand acute problems of the current world. The Assembly \r\nshould also create mechanisms that would allow for the \r\nmonitoring of the implementation of its decisions and \r\nat the same time provide for the elimination of \r\noutdated measures that overburden its work.  \r\n Thought should also be given to the \r\nrepresentativeness of the bodies established by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Slovakia, as a member of the Group \r\nof Eastern European States, appreciates the election of \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim as President of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. At the same time, it should be \r\nemphasized that the Eastern European Group is the \r\nmost dynamically growing regional group in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, yet its representation in managerial \r\npositions in the Secretariat and in United Nations \r\nbodies does not reflect that situation. A prime example \r\nof the situation is the fact that this year not one of the \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 30 \r\n \r\nAssembly’s Vice-Presidents is from the regional group \r\nof which the Slovak Republic is a member. \r\n Besides the efforts aimed at reforming the United \r\nNations, the Slovak Republic wishes to pay special \r\nattention to the issue of security sector reform during \r\nthe sixty-second session. We believe that insufficient \r\nreform or lack of reform in the security sector is often \r\na source or catalyst of conflicts, or even causes post-\r\nconflict countries to lapse back to a conflict state. It \r\nshould also be borne in mind that a well-governed \r\nsecurity sector should, above all, ensure human \r\nsecurity, which represents the foundation for the \r\nstability, good governance and, ultimately, \r\ndevelopment of a country. \r\n We are expecting a comprehensive report by the \r\nSecretary-General on security sector reform, which \r\nshould become the basis of a more in-depth discussion \r\non this issue within the United Nations. Therefore, \r\nSlovakia has decided to initiate a thematic discussion \r\non security sector reform during the sixty-second \r\nsession. \r\n The Slovak Republic also expects the sixty-\r\nsecond session to revitalize the discussion on \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Slovakia has had an opportunity to \r\ncontribute to these efforts through its chairmanship of \r\nthe Security Council Committee established pursuant \r\nto resolution 1540 (2004). In this context, in February \r\n2007 Slovakia also initiated an open debate in the \r\nSecurity Council on non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. \r\n The destructive potential of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction increases along with the growing threat of \r\ninternational terrorism. We therefore also wish to pay \r\nspecial attention to this threat to international peace \r\nand security. The United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy adopted by the General Assembly \r\nlast year (resolution 60/288) provided for wide-ranging \r\ninternational cooperation in this field. \r\n The Slovak Republic pays due attention to the \r\neconomic and social aspects of the United Nations, \r\nwhere we wish to engage even more actively. In 2003, \r\nwe submitted our candidacy for membership in the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for the years 2010 to \r\n2012. We will be pleased to receive support from other \r\nMember States for our candidacy. \r\n As a new development aid donor, we want to \r\nfacilitate more effective cooperation with both \r\nbeneficiary and donor countries, integrate the work of \r\ninternational agencies and make more efficient use of \r\nthe existing United Nations capacities in this area. We \r\nwish to pay special attention to the development of \r\npost-conflict regions, which currently receive the \r\nlargest portion of development aid. We believe that \r\nthere will be room in the Economic and Social Council \r\nfor Slovakia to utilize its experience in the field of \r\nsecurity sector reform in the joint work with other \r\nbodies of the United Nations system. \r\n Over the past two years, Slovakia has worked for \r\nthe first time as a member of the Security Council. \r\nWhen adopting our decisions on the sensitive problems \r\nof the modern world, we took into consideration the \r\npeculiarities of individual cases, yet at the same time, \r\nwe sought to promote the value system of a member of \r\nthe European and trans-Atlantic community. Slovakia \r\nwill continue to work within the United Nations in this \r\nsame spirit, even after the completion of its current \r\nterm in the Security Council. We also wish to make \r\ngood use of the experience we have gained in our work \r\nin other United Nations bodies. \r\n The Slovak Republic is frustrated that no solution \r\nto the Kosovo issue has yet been found. In our opinion, \r\nKosovo must not thwart the unification of European \r\nnations nor set a negative precedent in terms of \r\ninternational law. \r\n It is with hope that we view the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1769 (2007), granting a \r\nmandate for the deployment of a joint African Union-\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation in Darfur. This \r\nunprecedented decision has moved the cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \r\nto a new level. \r\n With regard to the Middle East issue, Slovakia \r\nendorses a peaceful, fair and permanent solution to the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. The talks should result in \r\nthe establishment of a viable Palestinian State that will \r\ncoexist with Israel in an atmosphere of perpetual peace \r\nand security. In this context, we appreciate the \r\nresumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine \r\nand the measures taken in this respect by the Quartet. \r\n It has been seven years since our Millennium \r\nsession, when we discussed our vision for the future of \r\nlife on our planet. It has been neither seven rich nor \r\nseven poor years. The United Nations has made some \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n31 07-51584 \r\n \r\nprogress. On the other hand, it has failed to cope with \r\nmany challenges. We must do better together to make \r\nthe future score fall more in favour of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Prince Albert II \r\nof Monaco \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill hear an address by His Serene Highness Prince \r\nAlbert II of Monaco. \r\n His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Serene Highness Prince Albert \r\nII of Monaco and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Prince Albert (spoke in French): Allow me, at \r\nthe outset, to address my warmest congratulations to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. With that election, which honours your \r\ncountry, the Group of Eastern European States and the \r\nmembers of this Assembly have unanimously \r\nrecognized, Sir, your eminent competence and your \r\nperfect knowledge of the Organization. You and the \r\nother members of the Bureau may be assured of the \r\nactive cooperation of my delegation. \r\n You have chosen the theme of climate change for \r\nthis sixty-second session. I would like to thank you for \r\nthat initiative, which has been commended by all. \r\n Today, I would like to share my observations on \r\nthis issue as well as my personal commitment in \r\nservice of this cause. Very early on, I learned to \r\nappreciate nature and to take the necessary measures to \r\nprotect it. From my very earliest years, I was taught to \r\nshare and to give back. Then I wanted to see and learn \r\nthings for myself, and my responsibility today is to \r\ntestify and to act. \r\n That is why, in June 2006, I decided to make my \r\nown contribution, as well as that of the Principality, by \r\ncreating a Foundation. The mission of the Prince \r\nAlbert II Foundation is to identify priority and \r\nsymbolic projects and to accelerate their \r\nimplementation in order to reach concrete results \r\nthroughout the world aimed at a sustainable and \r\nequitable management of natural resources. \r\n The Foundation’s activities are based on three \r\nstrategic principles. The first is to act alongside \r\nnations, international institutions and opinion leaders \r\nin order to enhance consciousness of and accelerate \r\ndecisions for sustainable development. I am personally \r\ncommitted to leading consciousness-raising missions \r\non the ground around the world. I will also stand with \r\nother heads of States, as I do today, and take part in \r\ninternational negotiation meetings regarding the \r\nenvironment. \r\n The second objective of my Foundation is to \r\npromote initiatives, activities and corporate actions that \r\ncombine innovation with environmental protection. \r\nThe Foundation in supporting and financing about \r\n30 projects as of this year. Through its activities, the \r\nFoundation also wishes to attest to the fact that it is \r\npossible to engage in sustainable practices and \r\nbehaviour that are respectful of the environment and \r\ncompatible with economic, social and human \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Lastly, its third objective is to create the broadest \r\npossible public understanding of the environmental \r\nchallenges and responsibilities involved in those issues \r\nvia outreach activities. I commit myself to devoting the \r\ntime and energy necessary to the success of those \r\nactions. \r\n All the programmes adopted by the Foundation \r\ncomply with the environmental policy of my country. \r\nMonaco has long been active in protecting the marine \r\nenvironment and in developing scientific research in \r\nmarine biology. The creation a century ago of the \r\nOceanographic Museum and the Museum of \r\nPrehistoric Anthropology by my great-great-\r\ngrandfather Albert I, and the more recent creation of an \r\nunderwater reserve by my father, Prince Rainier III, \r\nbear witness to that policy. The RAMOGE Agreements \r\nfor the control of marine pollution and the Agreement \r\non the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, the \r\nMediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Area \r\nreinforced that international engagement. That vocation \r\nis part of the history of my country. \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 32 \r\n \r\n This year, I agreed to sponsor an ambitious \r\ninternational initiative launched by the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme, the objective of which is to \r\nprovide for the planting of at least 1 billion trees \r\nthroughout the world in 2007. Seven months after the \r\nlaunch of the operation, that objective was achieved. It \r\nis an extraordinary sign of hope, and I must commend \r\nthe dynamism of the Programme, whose actions within \r\nthe United Nations are essential for the environment. \r\n The time for action is today. We already know \r\nthat the future of humanity is at stake. This is a \r\ncollective responsibility. To tackle this urgent matter, it \r\nis necessary to raise awareness, mobilize capacities and \r\nrevolutionize our lifestyle. That is how we will forge a \r\nnew relationship to nature. As Yves Coppens, a French \r\nscientist, stresses: “for millennia, climate has dictated \r\nman’s behaviour; today, it is man who dictates his \r\nbehaviour on nature”. \r\n It is also necessary to commit ourselves to \r\npromoting a new ethic — that of the right to the \r\nprotection of the environment. What better place is \r\nthere than this prestigious institution to lead the way \r\nforward? That new ethical dimension can be achieved \r\nonly if built on the sincere commitment of each \r\nindividual. That is why Bill Clinton, in his recent book, \r\ncalls for concrete mobilization. As he says so well, \r\n“each one of us can give something. There is so much \r\nto do; it is never too late to start”. Like President \r\nClinton, I believe that generosity is at the heart of that \r\nmobilization. \r\n It is thus imperative to transcend our own \r\nselfishness and inertia, and to learn to develop a \r\nharmonious relationship between humankind and \r\nnature. Safeguarding our planet is the challenge of the \r\ntwenty-first century. That challenge requires courage, \r\ntenacity, commitment and generosity. Above all, let us \r\nact. Peter Frumhoff, one of the main contributors to the \r\nreport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange, declared, following a large-scale study \r\nundertaken by the Union of Concerned Scientists, that \r\n“some changes are inevitable, but the worst \r\nconsequences can be avoided if we act quickly”. That \r\nmessage was reiterated over and over again yesterday \r\nduring the high-level event on climate change \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General. \r\n The European Union has shown the way by \r\ncommitting to a 50 per cent reduction of its greenhouse \r\ngases by 2050. Let us help developing countries by \r\nfinding new financial resources; let us quickly update \r\nour modes of production and consumption. To meet \r\nthat challenge, we must work together to find solutions \r\nto existing problems. Individual announcements or \r\nactions will never solve the problem. The threat is \r\nglobal. As the climatologist Edouard Bard has pointed \r\nout, “global warming concerns our entire ecosystem \r\nand the consequences of this phenomenon can be done \r\nonly at the global level”. \r\n We have long lived in a world fraught with \r\nthreats, but for the first time we are facing a planetary \r\nthreat that threatens humankind itself. The evolution of \r\nhuman mindsets and behaviour will inevitably take \r\ntime, but the planet cannot wait. Thus, without further \r\ndelay, we must adopt a culture of responsibility. We \r\nmust meet this historic challenge so that we may \r\npreserve planet Earth for our children. Let us make the \r\nchoice of hope based on humanistic values, and let us \r\nnot forget the power of courage when it is supported by \r\nthe will to place humankind at the core of our \r\npriorities. \r\n There are also ethical considerations which \r\ninspire my country’s constant and resolute commitment \r\nin the fight against terrorism. In no circumstances can \r\nviolence ever be a legitimate means to pursue any \r\ncombat, whatever the cause may be. \r\n To consolidate its legal framework in compliance \r\nwith international standards, and according to the \r\nrecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force \r\non Money Laundering (FATF), the Principality of \r\nMonaco took measures identical to the European Union \r\ndirectives adopted to fight money laundering and \r\nterrorism. Without waiting for the new report of the \r\nSelect Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-\r\nMoney Laundering Measures, in this area, my \r\nGovernment enacted new laws and regulations on these \r\nissues. With those tireless efforts, Monaco has been \r\npublicly recognized for leading the way in this field. I \r\nwill maintain the required vigilance so that our \r\nlegislative framework and our security policy will \r\ncontinue to guarantee the reputation of the Principality \r\nas a safe State. In so doing, I reiterate my unfaltering \r\ndetermination to combat the manifestations of \r\nterrorism regardless of their forms. \r\n For my country, sustainable development and the \r\nfight against poverty go hand in hand, in that we are \r\ncalled upon to identify a new manner of growth more \r\nrespectful of the resources of our planet, which, while \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n33 07-51584 \r\n \r\nabundant, are not inexhaustible. That is the reason why \r\nI asked my Government to increase by 30 per cent for \r\nthe year 2008, under the heading of international \r\ncooperation, the total of the Principality’s voluntary \r\ncontributions to the funds and programmes of the \r\nUnited Nations. This significant increase of funding for \r\nofficial development assistance is proof my country’s \r\ndetermination to eventually reach the target of devoting \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income to official \r\ndevelopment assistance. A great deal remains to be \r\ndone in the fields of education, access to health care, \r\nthe fight against pandemics and HIV/AIDS, human \r\ncrises following natural disasters or conflicts and, \r\nlastly, the fight against poverty. \r\n I pay particular attention to the Principality’s \r\nactions through multilateral and bilateral assistance \r\nprogrammes, supplemented by the generous initiatives \r\nof the charitable organizations in Monaco, which are \r\nalso part of my country’s tradition. \r\n Children’s welfare has, for a long time, been a \r\npriority commitment for the Principality. My sister, \r\nHer Royal Highness the Princess of Hanover, is \r\nactively involved with this issue through the World \r\nAssociation of Children’s Friends (AMADE \r\nMondiale). In December, the General Assembly will \r\nhold a debate to evaluate progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action \r\nentitled “A world fit for children” (resolution S-27/2), \r\nadopted in 2002. Considerable progress has been \r\nachieved in five years, although there still are too many \r\nneeds to be met. \r\n Monaco has also joined the campaign entitled \r\n“Unite for children. Unite against AIDS,” sponsored by \r\nUNICEF, the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health \r\nOrganization. My sister, Princess Stephanie, Special \r\nRepresentative of UNAIDS, has committed herself \r\nwholeheartedly to harnessing the energies of the \r\nPrincipality and beyond to advance in the fight against \r\nthis scourge. \r\n Reform of the Security Council remains a current \r\nissue. I reaffirm my country’s support for a process of \r\nincreasing the membership of this Council. In fact, the \r\nchances of maintaining international peace and security \r\nwill be that much greater if the representation of the \r\ninternational community in the Security Council were \r\nthe most equitable possible. \r\n I also express the wish that the newly established \r\nDepartment of Field Support, working alongside the \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, will facilitate \r\nthe actions of United Nations personnel on the ground \r\nworking valiantly to safeguard peace. I congratulate \r\nthe Secretary-General on the efforts he has undertaken \r\nto these ends. \r\n My country became a Member of the United \r\nNations 14 years ago. Ever since, the Principality has \r\nincreased its participation on the international scene. \r\nThe Principality has taken pleasure in hosting many \r\ninternational meetings and high-level conferences in \r\nrecent years.  \r\n Accordingly, I am delighted that in February \r\n2008, the tenth special session of the Governing \r\nCouncil of United Nations Environment Programme \r\nand the Global Ministerial Environment Forum will be \r\nheld in Monaco. On that occasion, I will proudly \r\nreceive ministers of the environment of Member States \r\nto discuss topics similar to those we are tackling within \r\nthe General Assembly framework and thus to continue \r\nthe debate launched here. In so doing, my country will, \r\nI hope, contribute once again its part to the \r\nfundamental debates of our time and will reaffirm its \r\nwill to be at the heart of the genuine struggle. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank His Serene \r\nHighness Prince Albert II of Monaco for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n  His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Estonia.  \r\n  Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Ilves: I shall speak today on four \r\nfundamental topics: climate change, cybersecurity, \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 34 \r\n \r\nconflict resolution and cooperation among international \r\norganizations. \r\n In accordance with the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, as well as \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries are \r\nobligated to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. \r\nEstonia has already achieved the basic target of the \r\nKyoto Protocol: our emissions of greenhouse gases \r\nhave been cut back by over 50 per cent. Fully \r\nsubscribing to the European Union statement on the \r\npost-2012 vision for international climate, released by \r\nthe Portuguese presidency, we hope that the \r\nnegotiations concerning a new global climate deal will \r\nreach a new comprehensive and global political \r\nagreement by as early as December 2009.  \r\n Yes, we recognize that developing countries have \r\nspecial needs in the areas of sustainable economic \r\ngrowth and eradication of poverty. But we also need to \r\ndecouple economic growth from energy consumption \r\nand carbon dioxide emissions. Investing in energy \r\nefficiency will have a huge impact on our future. \r\nDiversification of the energy supply and greater use of \r\nrenewable energies are the way forward.  \r\n The resources and the technology for \r\ndecarbonisation come primarily from industrial \r\nnations. Therefore, we need to continue the dialogue \r\nbetween industrialized and developing nations \r\nconcerning the adoption of a “green” economy, \r\nreducing carbon-fuel dependency and counterbalancing \r\nclimate change caused by human activities. We need to \r\npromote technology transfer, which is necessary for \r\ndeveloping environment-friendly energy production. \r\nEstonia believes that the best way forward is to tie \r\ndevelopment assistance to investment in clean \r\ntechnologies. \r\n If in the past people were connected by sea lanes \r\nand trade routes, today we are ever more connected by \r\nthe Internet, along with the threats that loom in \r\ncyberspace. Cyberattacks are a clear example of \r\ncontemporary asymmetrical threats to security. They \r\nmake it possible, with limited means and from a \r\ndistance, to paralyse a society.  \r\n In the future, cyberattacks may, in the hands of \r\ncriminals or terrorists or terrorist States, become a \r\nconsiderably more widespread and dangerous weapon \r\nthan they are at present. Cyberattacks are a threat not \r\nonly to sophisticated information technology systems, \r\nbut also to communities as a whole. For example, they \r\ncould be used to paralyse a city’s emergency medical \r\nservices. The threats posed by cyberwarfare have often \r\nbeen underestimated, since, fortunately, they have not \r\nas yet resulted in the loss of any lives. Also, for \r\nsecurity reasons, the details of cyberattacks are often \r\nnot publicized.  \r\n In addition to taking concrete technical and legal \r\nmeasures to counter cyberattacks, Governments must \r\nmorally define cyberviolence and cybercrime, which \r\ndeserve to be generally condemned in the same way as \r\nterrorism and the trafficking in human beings are \r\ncondemned. Fighting against cyberwarfare is in the \r\ninterests of us all. It requires both appropriate domestic \r\nmeasures and international efforts. \r\n In April and May of this year, my country, \r\nEstonia, coped successfully with an extensive \r\ncyberattack, and we are prepared to share with other \r\ncountries the know-how that we have acquired. We call \r\nupon the international community to cooperate in legal \r\nmatters in questions concerning cybersecurity. But, \r\nsince this whole subject is in a relatively new field, it is \r\nessential to establish an appropriate legal space. As a \r\nfirst step, we call upon all countries to accede to the \r\nConvention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe. \r\nThe Convention is also open for accession by  \r\nnon-members of the Council. \r\n We should move ahead and create a truly \r\ninternational framework for combating these vicious \r\nacts. The Global Cybersecurity Agenda of the \r\nInternational Telecommunications Union, launched by \r\nthe Secretary-General in May, is an important initiative \r\nfor building international cooperation in this field. \r\nEstonia also agrees with the assessment of the \r\nspecialists of the United Nations Institute for Training \r\nand Research that a globally negotiated and \r\ncomprehensive cyberspace law is essential and that the \r\nUnited Nations can provide the neutral and legitimate \r\nforum necessary for that task. \r\n The United Nations is determined to resolve \r\nconflicts. Understandably, conflict prevention and \r\nresolution, particularly in Africa, is a top priority. We \r\nwelcome the creation of a United Nations-African \r\nUnion peacekeeping force to quell the violence and \r\ninstability plaguing the Darfur region of the Sudan. \r\n It is important to settle conflicts in other places as \r\nwell, such as Afghanistan. We need to increase the \r\npresence and visibility of the United Nations there, \r\nwhich would be an encouraging sign for the local \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n35 07-51584 \r\n \r\npopulation and would also send a signal to other \r\ninternational aid organizations and non-governmental \r\norganizations that they should increase their activities. \r\nThe United Nations should also assume a greater role \r\nin coordinating the reconstruction effort in \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n I would like to highlight one conflict in Europe in \r\nwhich the United Nations has a significant role to play: \r\nthe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia. Along with the other \r\n“frozen” conflicts in the neighbouring region, it \r\nremains among the last unresolved conflicts in Europe. \r\nIt is my hope that the Group of Friends of the \r\nSecretary-General will have the determination to find \r\nsolutions that honour Georgia’s territorial integrity. We \r\ncannot be satisfied with the current situation. It is \r\nimportant to build confidence between the parties and \r\nto resume the meetings between the representatives of \r\nGeorgia’s Government and those of Abkhazia. There is \r\nno place for military provocations, internal or external.  \r\n A major task for the United Nations remains the \r\nfacilitation of the return of refugees to Abkhazia, \r\nwhich, unfortunately, has been greatly hampered. \r\nProgress regarding the conflict is possible if all \r\ninterested parties act in a constructive way. We must \r\ngenerate the political will necessary to resolve the \r\nconflict. In that context, I welcome the increased \r\ncontribution of the European Union (EU). \r\n The international community should also secure \r\nthe best and most rational use of available resources, \r\nincluding in emergency and crisis response situations. \r\nFor example, both the United Nations and the EU were \r\ninvolved in managing the response to the Asian \r\ntsunami in 2004 and the Lebanese crisis in 2006. That \r\nonce again brought to the fore the necessity of \r\ndeveloping common needs assessments — to further \r\ndiscuss the roles and mandates of the relevant actors, \r\nsuch as the United Nations Office for the Coordination \r\nof Humanitarian Affairs, the European Commission’s \r\nDirectorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and the \r\nCommunity Mechanism for Civil Protection of the EU. \r\n Poverty, armed conflicts and natural disasters \r\nsuch as floods, tsunamis and forest fires are all causes \r\nof another global problem — forced migration, which \r\nshould also be tackled in a more concerted manner by \r\nthe whole international community. Being forced to \r\nleave one’s home is always a tragedy. I know: my \r\nfamily was forced to leave my country, fleeing brutal \r\nSoviet occupation forces. Trying to integrate into a new \r\nsociety is always a significant challenge. Only through \r\nwell-coordinated common efforts can we ensure that \r\npeople never again have to leave their homes because \r\nthey have no other option. Thus, a global approach to \r\nhuman migration should remain a vital issue on the \r\nUnited Nations agenda. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Estonia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos \r\nSantos, President of the Republic of Angola \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Angola.  \r\n Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Angola, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Angola, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Dos Santos (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset, \r\nI would like to salute the international community, \r\nlegitimately represented here today. I would also like \r\nto take this opportunity to personally congratulate \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his election to the post of \r\nSecretary-General of our Organization. I am confident, \r\nSir, that your able leadership, steadfastness and \r\ncommitment will assist us in our search for consensual \r\nsolutions to the issues that affect humanity in order to \r\nmake the world an increasingly safer, freer and fairer \r\nplace. \r\n Today, the world is confronted with global \r\nwarming, a consequence of the atmospheric pollution \r\nresulting from human activity on Earth, which is \r\ncausing dramatic and dangerous climate change. The \r\nworld is also confronted with extremists who resort to \r\nterrorism and the use of religion for political ends; with \r\ngrowing militarism as a would-be response to \r\nterrorism; and with the hoarding of capital, information \r\nand know-how, all of which widen the gap between the \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 36 \r\n \r\nrich and the poor and generate social tensions around \r\nthe world. \r\n On the issue of terrorism, the model of an open, \r\ndemocratic and tolerant civilization, with a State that \r\nserves the interests of all, has shown that parties that \r\nalternate in political office in the post-cold-war period \r\ncan coexist and fight for their principles and values \r\nthrough peaceful means. I believe that the same model \r\ncan be successful if properly adjusted to the concrete \r\nrealities of other regions. \r\n At the same time, we must continue to deepen our \r\nstudy and analysis of the threat of terrorism and use \r\npeaceful means to seek an ever-broader consensus on \r\nthe collective responses needed to counter it.  \r\n Islam can peacefully coexist in societies with \r\nother religious beliefs. However, it is necessary to \r\nneutralize fanaticism and prevent the Islamization of \r\nthe State, which is contrary to humanity’s modern legal \r\nconcept of a secular State. \r\n In our opinion, it is necessary to defend cultural \r\ndiversity and to render more inclusive and fair the \r\nprocess of political, economic and social development; \r\nto support and stimulate, in countries that are \r\npredominantly Islamic, all the forces and movements \r\nthat defend modern life and the separation of State \r\nfrom religion; and to support the values and privileges \r\nof the universal culture that are enshrined in \r\nconventions, charters and international treaties. This \r\nmovement is immense, it continues to grow and it can \r\nbe more effective than military action, which in our \r\nunderstanding should only constitute a last resort.  \r\n Ecumenism and dialogue among cultures are \r\nother avenues for action that can be better and more \r\nfrequently used to bring together the dominant \r\nreligions and all the people of the world, based on the \r\nideals of peace, solidarity and fraternity. \r\n The fight against poverty and hunger in the \r\nworld, with a global plan monitored by the United \r\nNations as an international convention, higher and \r\nfairer remuneration for commodities or natural \r\nresources extracted from developing countries and \r\ntechnical support to poor States would contribute \r\ngreatly to eliminating social inequalities and the social \r\nseedbed and support of those who prefer violence. \r\n In this regard, the globalization of the economy \r\nmust be regulated in order to mitigate the asymmetries \r\nbetween the centre and the periphery of the economic \r\nsystem and to ensure that each person has the \r\nnecessary means for survival with dignity. \r\n Such regulation should further address \r\nenvironmental matters. There are countries that have \r\nexperienced rapid industrial development without \r\npaying due attention to the protection of the \r\nenvironment. Other countries are now involved in an \r\nidentical endeavour, thus increasing the production of \r\ncarbon dioxide and worsening the greenhouse effect. It \r\nis plain that a new meeting of all world leaders is \r\nurgently required in order to approve and begin the \r\nexecution of a global plan of environmental protection. \r\n We therefore support the initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General to that end, convinced that the \r\ncountries that most pollute the atmosphere, such as the \r\nrichest countries, should contribute more resources to \r\nits protection. \r\n Today, the Republic of Angola is in a position to \r\nengage more actively in this collective effort of \r\nsolidarity for humanity, because the country has been \r\nat peace for a little more than five years and is moving \r\ntowards complete normalization of its political, \r\neconomic and social life. Proof of that lies in the fact \r\nthat Angola has already signed all the international \r\nprotocols in favour of environmental protection, such \r\nas the Kyoto and the Montreal Protocols, while \r\ncontributing to conflict resolution and peace in its \r\nregion and in the African continent as a whole. \r\n As a country that has recently chaired the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, we are pleased to learn of \r\nthe important progress achieved in consolidating the \r\npeace processes in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and Serra \r\nLeone. \r\n However, the conflict between Ethiopia and \r\nEritrea and the conflict in Darfur, Sudan, still prevail, \r\nwhile the issue of Western Sahara’s self-determination \r\nremains unresolved. I am convinced that the \r\nOrganization will remain engaged in the search for a \r\nsolution to these problems in the shortest time possible \r\nand that United Nations forces will be urgently \r\ndeployed in Darfur. \r\n The Commission of the Gulf of Guinea is \r\ncurrently headquartered in Luanda, where the \r\nrepresentatives of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation \r\nof the South Atlantic met recently at the initiative of \r\nAngola. Both institutions promote peace, security, \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n37 07-51584 \r\n \r\nstability and multiform cooperation among their \r\nmembers, in consonance with the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. \r\n I must highlight the decisive role that regional \r\nand subregional organizations can play in the \r\nprevention and resolution of conflicts. At the same \r\ntime, they can alert everyone to the need to strengthen \r\nthe mandates and the financing of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, without prejudice to post-\r\nconflict activities, such as disarmament and the \r\nresettlement of populations, among other actions. \r\n In the particular case of Africa, it is in our \r\ninterest to see the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) fully achieved, so that the growth rate of the \r\nentire continent can be aligned with that of the world \r\neconomy. The reduction of extreme poverty by 50 per \r\ncent by 2015, as foreseen by the United Nations, must \r\nbe accompanied by a decisive fight against hunger and \r\ndisease, including HIV/AIDS and other endemic \r\nscourges. The effectiveness of these actions depends, \r\nhowever, on complementary achievements, such as \r\nfairer trade with developed countries, greater fluidity \r\nin the transfer of capital, official development \r\nassistance and forgiveness of foreign debt. \r\n In recent years, significant progress has been \r\nmade in the reform of the United Nations system. It is \r\nnevertheless important to continue to move forward in \r\nthat process, especially in regard to the Security \r\nCouncil, with the objective of strengthening the \r\nauthority and the effectiveness of the Organization and \r\nmaking it more representative, more democratic and \r\nmore participatory in the areas of international security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. \r\n In spite of criticism and some known failures, the \r\nUnited Nations remains the only institution at the \r\ninternational level with the prestige and credibility to \r\nresolve inter-State conflicts and crises that, due to their \r\ndimensions, escape the control of the authorities of a \r\nState or endanger its population. \r\n The United Nations-led fight against \r\nconventional, nuclear, chemical and biological \r\nweapons and landmines, in addition to the \r\npeacekeeping and humanitarian operations of the Blue \r\nHelmets in many regions, have contributed to greater \r\nworld security. In that regard, it is important to \r\nstrengthen the monitoring of the implementation of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT), so as to move towards a global disarmament \r\nprocess and discourage a new arms race. It is also \r\nurgent to relaunch the Middle East peace process in a \r\ncommitted and comprehensive manner, for the Middle \r\nEast remains unstable and the source of a constant \r\nthreat to world peace. \r\n A recurring theme in the Assembly’s agenda is \r\nthe embargo against Cuba. It is imperative to put an \r\nend once and for all to the economic, trade and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica, as it violates the principles of international \r\nlaw and Chapters I and II of the United Nations \r\nCharter. Angola hopes that the United Nations will \r\nstate its view on this matter and remain faithful to the \r\ncore of its Charter, according to which all actions must \r\nbe the result of a debate and a collective decision, thus \r\nexcluding unilateralism. \r\n The challenges that lie ahead of us entail a \r\nconstructive dialogue among all the countries involved, \r\nespecially among heads of State and Government, who \r\nwill have to overcome possible differences and \r\nimpediments and will have to find middle ground \r\nbetween the possible and the desirable, between \r\nboldness and realism. \r\n We believe that through joint action, the \r\npromotion of dialogue among civilizations and the \r\nrevitalization of the spirit of international solidarity, it \r\nwill be possible to build a better world for all. A world \r\nof peace, based on justice and the rule of law, without \r\nweapons of war and without dangerous pollution is a \r\nsafer world. Its construction depends entirely on the \r\npolitical will of all States Members of the United \r\nNations, especially the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council. Let us all unite our forces for a better \r\nworld for all. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Angola for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. José Eduardo Santo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Angola, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 38 \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Italy \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Italy. \r\n Mr. Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Italy, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Romano Prodi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Italy, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Prodi (Italy) (spoke in Italian; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): I wish to offer you my \r\nheartfelt congratulations, Sir, on your election to \r\npreside over this sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly. Your experience in international affairs and \r\nyour first-hand knowledge of the Organization make \r\nyou particularly suitable for this important post. At the \r\nsame time I sincerely thank your predecessor, \r\nMs. Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, for her wise and \r\ndedicated leadership of the Assembly. \r\n I want to begin my statement where I left off last \r\nyear, with Italy’s decision to defend human rights in \r\nthe world and to oppose the death penalty. In recent \r\nmonths, Italy has worked very hard to enable the \r\nAssembly to adopt a resolution on a universal \r\nmoratorium on the death penalty, with a view to its \r\ncomplete abolition. It has been a source of great \r\nsatisfaction to see support for our initiative growing \r\nday by day in Europe and in every other region of the \r\nworld. We have now reached a decisive moment. \r\n I trust that we shall all be united in this battle, \r\nwhich is supported by Nobel laureates, statesmen and \r\nstateswomen, and free men and women throughout the \r\nworld, and that the “growing trend in international law \r\nand national practice toward a phasing out of the death \r\npenalty” — to quote Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\n(Press release SG/SM/10839) — will be officially \r\nsanctioned by this General Assembly’s adoption of the \r\ndraft resolution we are about to submit together with \r\nmany countries from every regional group and from the \r\nEuropean Union. If genuine politics means showing \r\nforesight, we shall perform a great political act through \r\nthe adoption of that draft resolution. It will \r\ndemonstrate that humankind is capable of making \r\nprogress not only in science, but also in the field of \r\nethics. \r\n A United Nations resolution against the death \r\npenalty will prove that human beings are better today \r\nthan they were yesterday, even in moral terms. An \r\noutcome with enormous consequences, heralding a \r\nmore just future, and a society that has at last freed \r\nitself from the spiral of revenge, demonstrating that it \r\nhas heeded the ancient admonition: if you want peace, \r\nyou must work for justice. \r\n Last year we welcomed the ceasefire in Lebanon \r\nand the launch of the new United Nations Interim \r\nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which has been under \r\nItalian command for several months now. Today, \r\nthanks in part to our common commitment, Lebanon is \r\nin a better situation, although it has not yet solved its \r\nproblems, as the brutal attacks of recent days have \r\nunfortunately demonstrated. \r\n We must continue to support the Lebanese \r\nreconciliation process and help the country to regain its \r\nunity through the election of a new President. We must \r\ndo this without ignoring the root causes of the conflicts \r\nafflicting the Middle East, first and foremost the \r\nPalestinian question. In short, we must continue to \r\nmobilize support for reconciliation among peoples and \r\nwithin a single people. \r\n Restoring peace to the Middle East is the top \r\npriority of the international community, because if one \r\nday this region should find greater peace, freedom and \r\nprosperity, we shall all live in greater peace, freedom \r\nand prosperity. I am therefore delighted that the United \r\nStates has promoted a new international meeting. We \r\nare ready to provide our input and we are already \r\npreparing it, knowing that the more countries in the \r\nregion that are behind this meeting, the greater the \r\npossibility of success. \r\n Italy will continue to play its part in the rest of \r\nthe region too, beginning with dialogue. For it is \r\nthrough dialogue that the most difficult issues can be \r\nresolved. I have never seen a lasting solution to a \r\nproblem when the solution was imposed from above or \r\nfrom outside. \r\n Today’s challenges, such as bringing peace to the \r\nMiddle East, are complex. If we wish to overcome \r\nthem we must rise to their dimensions. In other words, \r\nwe have to set aside all partisan interests in a world \r\nthat is increasingly shaped by global processes.  \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n39 07-51584 \r\n \r\n This applies also to climate change, to which this \r\nsession is most appropriately dedicated. As I said \r\nyesterday at the panel convened by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Italy considers climate change a priority \r\nissue. We are among the European supporters of a \r\nunilateral 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas \r\nemissions by 2020. We have made similar \r\ncommitments on energy efficiency, renewable energy \r\nsources and biofuels. In Europe we have already made \r\nvarious strategic decisions, but it is obvious that any \r\npost-Kyoto agreement can only be achieved within the \r\nUnited Nations, because when speaking about global \r\nwarming we are speaking about the pre-eminent global \r\nproblem of our day.  \r\n National approaches to solving the world’s \r\nproblems no longer exist. The era of making and \r\nunmaking national borders is long over. It is only \r\nthrough multilateralism, by marshalling everyone’s \r\nenergies, that we can hope to do good. \r\n Our task today is to adapt the multilateral \r\nstructures at our disposal to a changing world and to \r\nthink of new forms of global governance, for there is \r\nno other way to manage global processes.  \r\n The challenge facing Europe today is not to \r\nbecome resigned to the world as it is, but to seek to \r\nimprove it based on the values in which Europe \r\nbelieves: freedom, democracy, respect for others, and \r\nrespect for the rules of peaceful coexistence. That is \r\nwhy we are adapting our founding treaties. That is why \r\nwe are building a common foreign and defence policy. \r\nThat is why we have invented a new citizenship, \r\nEuropean citizenship, to which we are entitled by \r\nchoosing to share certain values, not by virtue of \r\nkinship or nationality.  \r\n The European dream is thus the child of the \r\nuniversal dream of the United Nations. In the past year \r\nthe United Nations has continued to play a central role \r\nin resolving international disputes. The cases of \r\nLebanon and Darfur demonstrate that if Member States \r\nare willing to give the United Nations a strong central \r\nrole, the Organization is today up to the task. We have \r\nto ask ourselves what the United Nations needs in \r\norder to fulfil its worldwide mission and to be equally \r\neffective in different crisis areas. \r\n First and foremost, we need an Organization \r\ncapable of renewal and adaptation. In the past two \r\nyears the revival of the reform process produced its \r\nfirst positive results. One essential aspect of reform \r\nrelates to the General Assembly, which remains the \r\nmain decision-making organ of the Organization. I \r\nnever tire of repeating that we have to restore the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s central position, and exploit its \r\npolitical guidance potential and, above all, its \r\nuniversality. \r\n The principles of democracy and the \r\nrepresentation of every Member State underpin the \r\nUnited Nations system. That is why we are opposed to \r\nany concept of Security Council reform that would \r\nestablish new permanent members. The growing \r\ncontribution of a growing number of countries to the \r\nOrganization should not be wasted by introducing \r\nelitist and selective reforms. \r\n It is clear that reforming the Security Council \r\nmeans addressing one of the fundamental pillars of the \r\nglobal security architecture. The Council’s central role \r\nand its nature as the paramount source of international \r\nlegitimacy impel us to seek shared political solutions.  \r\n Last year, in this very Hall, I advocated that \r\nnegotiations be started to break the deadlock and help \r\nstrengthen the Organization. I spoke of the need to start \r\nnegotiations based not on imposing predefined models \r\nand positions, but rather on the search for solutions \r\nbased on the widest possible consensus. \r\n I am therefore delighted that, one year later, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has decided to make every effort, \r\nthrough intergovernmental negotiations among others, \r\nto reach a general agreement on Security Council \r\nreform that we all hope will open a new chapter with a \r\nview to an agreed solution, a solution that I hope can \r\ninclude strengthening the presence of the leading \r\nregional stakeholders in the Security Council. My \r\ncountry is ready and will not fail to demonstrate \r\ncommitment and to contribute ideas in this new phase \r\nof the Security Council reform process.  \r\n Reform is also intended to make the Organization \r\nmore effective in the areas and on the issues where, by \r\nhistory and vocation, it can provide greater added \r\nvalue: Africa and development issues. \r\n The United Nations is deeply engaged in Africa. \r\nOver two thirds of the Blue Helmets are deployed in \r\nAfrica on peacekeeping missions. Italy will pursue this \r\ngoal through the establishment of the African Peace \r\nFacility fund, which will complement its European \r\ncounterpart fund. Darfur and Somalia remain two of \r\nour central concerns. \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 40 \r\n \r\n But it would be a mistake to look only at the \r\nnegative side and forget the many encouraging signs of \r\ndevelopment and unity coming from Africa. I am \r\nreferring to the growth of the economy and to the hope \r\nthat has arisen in many parts of the continent. \r\n In Europe we are now preparing for the second \r\nAfrica-Europe Summit. I hope that it will be held \r\nsuccessfully before the end of the year. Italy is working \r\nabove all to ensure that the Summit will spark a \r\nEuropean policy for Africa that is worthy of the name. \r\n That brings me to development. It is the \r\nresponsibility of the United Nations to keep \r\ndevelopment at the top of the international agenda. It \r\nwill take more than lip service to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals to achieve them. We all have to \r\nwork for their attainment. I have already expressed my \r\nwillingness to sit at a table next year for a progress \r\nreport on the implementation of the commitments we \r\nmade seven years ago. \r\n We can no longer ignore the reality around us: \r\none half of world trade and investment benefits 14 per \r\ncent of the world’s population; the 49 poorest countries \r\nin the world receive 0.5 per cent of the global product; \r\nand 90 per cent of the planet’s wealth lies in the hands \r\nof only 1 per cent of its inhabitants. Efforts are needed \r\nfrom everyone, particularly those who have more to \r\ngive. The G-8 can play an important role in this area. \r\nHere and now I pledge to make this issue the \r\ncentrepiece of the Italian presidency in 2009. \r\n The principles of solidarity and cooperation \r\nunderlying this Organization are as sound today as they \r\nwere 62 years ago. The spread of democratic values \r\nand greater attention to the protection of human rights \r\nshould not make us forget that these principles and \r\nvalues are still threatened and violated in far too many \r\nparts of the world. What is more, insecurity leads more \r\nand more people and countries to close themselves off. \r\n The danger is that this sense of insecurity can \r\ncause societies to regress. Even the most free and \r\ndemocratic nations, if they feel they are under threat, \r\nmay adopt measures that will undermine peace and \r\nwith it, the civil and political rights of their citizens. \r\n In the face of such risks, the principles and values \r\nof the United Nations are our beacons and our stars. \r\nThey make it possible for us to navigate even by night \r\nand in rough waters. Staying on course is not just a \r\npolitical imperative. It is above all a moral imperative \r\nfor all of us. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Italy for the statement just made. \r\n Mr. Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Italy, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the \r\nFederal Republic of Germany \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of \r\nGermany. \r\n Mrs. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Mrs. Angela Merkel, \r\nChancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, and \r\ninviting her to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mrs. Merkel (Germany) (spoke in German; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Please accept \r\nmy congratulations, Mr. President, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. I wish you every success. \r\n We are currently experiencing a period of \r\ndramatic changes. Great opportunities are accompanied \r\nby considerable risks. Global structures are changing. \r\nStates, economies and societies are becoming \r\nnetworked as never before. That is what we call \r\nglobalization. \r\n The good thing about that development is that \r\nprosperity is increasing, and more and more people are \r\nescaping from poverty. The challenge that that \r\ndevelopment poses is that not everyone has their fair \r\nshare of this prosperity. There are considerable \r\nimbalances. We thus need a global awareness, beyond \r\nnational boundaries, of our joint responsibility in order \r\nto master the major challenges facing our world. \r\n Climate change is undoubtedly one of the central \r\nchallenges facing humanity today. I therefore very \r\nmuch welcome your decision, Mr. President, to make \r\nclimate change the focus of this year’s session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Never before have the facts been so \r\nclear, the consensus among scientists so great or the \r\nneed for action so indisputable. Each and every country \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n41 07-51584 \r\n \r\nis affected by the impact of climate change. No one \r\ncountry can tackle it alone. Not to take action would \r\nincur immense costs and cause new global conflicts. \r\n What does that mean for the way ahead? In quite \r\nconcrete terms, it means that any contribution from \r\nindividual States or groups of States is welcome. \r\nHowever, I would like to add most emphatically that \r\nsuch contributions can only complement a post-Kyoto \r\nagreement under the auspices of the United Nations. \r\nThey can never replace it. \r\n This session of the General Assembly therefore \r\nhas to set the course for the next vital step: the climate \r\nconference in Bali. Environment ministers will have to \r\nagree in Bali on a clear road map so that negotiations \r\ncan be successfully concluded by 2009. There are three \r\nkey elements: a common understanding on the scale of \r\nemissions reduction, a common understanding on fair \r\nnational contributions and a common understanding on \r\nthe instruments we should use both to protect the \r\nclimate and to foster economic growth. \r\n The scope of the need for action is becoming \r\nincreasingly clear. We must at least halve global \r\nemissions by the middle of the century. For this we \r\nhave a clear guiding principle: the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibility. \r\nIndustrialized countries must embrace ambitious \r\nabsolute reduction targets. During the German \r\npresidency the European Union adopted bold targets \r\nfor 2020. All industrialized countries will have to \r\ndrastically reduce their per capita emissions. \r\n Emerging economies will first of all have to \r\ndecouple their economic growth from emissions. In the \r\nlong term, per capita emissions in both industrialized \r\ncountries and emerging economies will have to \r\nconverge at a level compatible with our global climate \r\nprotection target. \r\n Such a process of long-term convergence offers \r\nall countries scope to develop. It does not demand too \r\nmuch of anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that \r\nonly a United Nations agreement can provide the \r\ndependability this will require.  \r\n Climate protection will therefore be a litmus test \r\nof the international community’s ability to act \r\neffectively in the twenty-first century. For, on our own \r\ncontinent, we Europeans know from our daily \r\nexperience that — although any individual country is \r\ntoo small to make a real difference — together we can \r\nachieve much. \r\n In the light of our experience, I believe three \r\nprinciples are of crucial importance to our common \r\nfuture. First, economic strength and social \r\nresponsibility belong together. This principle applies \r\nboth to how States treat their citizens and to how States \r\ntreat each other. It emphasizes the right and freedom of \r\neach individual to achieve their full potential. At the \r\nsame time, it upholds cohesion and solidarity, while \r\ncategorically rejecting isolationism and protectionism. \r\n That is why we are seeking a balanced and \r\ncomprehensive agreement on multilateral trade. In \r\nconcrete terms, this means that we have to bring the \r\nDoha Round to an early and successful conclusion. Too \r\nmuch time has been wasted. We have to seize the last \r\nchance for negotiations this autumn. Our aim must be \r\ntransparent financial markets and effective protection \r\nof intellectual property, as well as minimum legal and \r\nsocial standards. For I am convinced that there can be \r\nno fair competition without common ground rules. \r\n We can only achieve cohesion and solidarity in a \r\nglobal development partnership. With the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, the international community has \r\nlaid down binding quantifiable targets and deadlines \r\nfor the first time. Together with its EU partners, \r\nGermany has undertaken to reach the United Nations \r\n0.7 per cent target no later than 2015. We stand by \r\nthese pledges. \r\n There can be no doubt that genuine partnership \r\nplaces all sides under an obligation — an obligation to \r\nstep up the fight against corruption, to aim for better \r\ngovernance and to better protect human rights. We \r\nwant to support Africa in particular. There have been \r\nencouraging developments on the continent but \r\nunfortunately, also, serious setbacks, for example in \r\nZimbabwe. \r\n “Growth and responsibility in the world \r\neconomy” is, therefore, also the motto guiding this \r\nyear’s German presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8). \r\n The second principle is that we have to \r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations. In \r\nmy view, there is absolutely no doubt — the United \r\nNations is the place where binding joint responses can \r\nbe found to global challenges. But the United Nations \r\nis in need of reform. This is true, above all, of the \r\nSecurity Council. In many crisis situations it needs to \r\nA/62/PV.5 \r\n \r\n07-51584 42 \r\n \r\nbe able to come up quickly with universally binding \r\nproposals. To do this, it must have international \r\nlegitimacy. However, the present composition of the \r\nSecurity Council no longer reflects the world today. \r\nThere is, therefore, no alternative to adapting it to \r\npolitical realities. \r\n My country has over the past years been actively \r\ninvolved in this debate. Germany is prepared to assume \r\nmore responsibility, and to take on a permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council. What we need now are tangible \r\nresults. We are by no means only at the start of our \r\nendeavours. The United Nations reform process has \r\nalready produced some results, such as the report of the \r\nHigh-level Panel on United Nations system-wide \r\ncoherence and the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n But time is short. There are numerous crises we \r\nhave to deal with right now. And notwithstanding the \r\nmany differing factors that have led to these crises, \r\nthey all have one thing in common: they can only be \r\nsolved multilaterally. The key to ending them is unity \r\nof purpose. This is particularly true with respect to \r\nIran. Iran has continuously worked on its nuclear \r\nprogramme in clear contradiction of the demands of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and the United \r\nNations. Nobody should be in the slightest doubt as to \r\nthe dangerous nature of this programme. Iran is \r\nignoring Security Council resolutions. Iran is blatantly \r\nthreatening Israel. \r\n Let us not fool ourselves. If Iran were to acquire \r\nthe nuclear bomb, the consequences would be \r\ndisastrous, first and foremost for the existence of \r\nIsrael; secondly, for the entire region; and ultimately \r\nfor all of us in Europe and the world who attach any \r\nimportance to the values of liberty, democracy and \r\nhuman dignity. That is why we have to prevent Iran \r\nfrom acquiring nuclear arms. \r\n The international community must not allow \r\nitself to be divided or have its decisive response to \r\nIran’s provocations undermined in any way. The world \r\ndoes not have to prove to Iran that Iran is building a \r\nnuclear bomb. Iran has to convince the world that it is \r\nnot striving towards such a bomb. \r\n Each and every German Chancellor before me \r\nhas shouldered Germany’s special responsibility for the \r\nexistence of Israel. I, too, pledge to live up to this \r\nresponsibility that our history has bequeathed us. It is \r\none of the fundamental principles that guides my \r\ncountry. In other words, Israel’s security is \r\nnon-negotiable for me as German Chancellor. And that \r\nbeing the case, we have to do more than pay lip-service \r\nto it. Together with its partners, Germany will continue \r\nto seek a diplomatic solution. With this aim in mind, \r\nGermany will — if Iran does not come around — \r\nfirmly advocate additional and harsher sanctions. \r\n Unity of purpose is also the key in the fight \r\nagainst international terrorism, and especially in our \r\nefforts aimed at security and stability in Afghanistan. \r\nUnity of purpose is also vital for ensuring a peaceful \r\nfuture in Kosovo, where NATO and the European \r\nUnion play a particularly active role. We want a \r\nsolution under United Nations auspices. All parties are \r\nnow called upon to show a willingness to compromise. \r\n We also strongly support the efforts of the Middle \r\nEast Quartet for peace in that region. Germany is a \r\nstaunch advocate of the vision of two States, within \r\nsecure borders and in peace, for the Jewish people in \r\nIsrael and for the Palestinians in Palestine. We \r\nwelcome the fact that both parties are continuing their \r\ntalks with great vigour, above all with a view to the \r\nMiddle East conference scheduled for November. \r\n The third principle is that we have to strengthen \r\nour shared immutable values. In my opinion, one of the \r\ngreat dangers of the twenty-first century is that crises \r\nand conflicts could give rise to a clash of civilizations. \r\nThis must not happen. For this reason, I plead for \r\ntolerance — tolerance as properly understood, not \r\n“anything goes” masquerading as tolerance. Everybody \r\nmust be able to follow his or her own path, but it must \r\nbe a path within the international community, not \r\noutside it. \r\n This path is clearly departed from wherever \r\nmassive human rights violations are committed, as in \r\nDarfur. A human tragedy is being played out there. Too \r\nmuch time has already been squandered. Now is the \r\ntime to act. The crimes perpetrated there must not go \r\nunpunished. This path has been departed from in \r\nMyanmar, where human rights have likewise been \r\ndisregarded for years. I urge the Government not to use \r\nforce against the peaceful demonstrators and finally to \r\nmake way for a democratic future for the country. This \r\npath is also departed from when political assassinations \r\nare carried out, as in the case of Rafik Hariri or the \r\nrecent cowardly attack just a few days ago in Lebanon. \r\nThe Hariri tribunal must commence its work with all \r\n A/62/PV.5\r\n \r\n43 07-51584 \r\n \r\npossible speed. I call on Syria to grant Lebanon \r\ndiplomatic recognition at long last. \r\n It is my fundamental conviction that we must, \r\ntime and again, muster the strength to assert our shared \r\nvalues of freedom and democracy. In order to do that, \r\nwe need an unshakeable foundation.  \r\n We have such a foundation: the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. It was written when Europe and wide \r\nswathes of the rest of the world lay in ruins. At the \r\nmost basic level, it is a statement that, notwithstanding \r\nall the dark chapters and tortuous turns of our history, \r\nuniversal human rights do exist. In other words, what it \r\nall comes down to is respecting and protecting the \r\ndignity of each individual person. That is the \r\n \r\nunderlying reason why we assemble here each year and \r\nwork together for the future of our peoples. \r\n Germany will do its utmost to advance that work. \r\nWe look forward to fruitful cooperation with all \r\npartners in the United Nations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chancellor of the \r\nFederal Republic of Germany for the statement she has \r\njust made. \r\n Mrs. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The meeting rose at 8.55 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
