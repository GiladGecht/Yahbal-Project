(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.20 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Valdis Zatlers, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Latvia. \r\n  Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of \r\nthe Republic of Latvia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Zatlers: I wish to begin by congratulating \r\nyou, Mr. Kerim, on your assumption of the post of \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. Your wise and energetic leadership will reflect \r\nthe abilities of the people of your country and of our \r\nregion as a whole. I also wish to congratulate and \r\nextend my best wishes to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, and to pledge him my full support. \r\nIt is evident that the Secretary-General recognizes the \r\nmultitude of challenges the world is facing today. Only \r\ntwo days ago, I took part in the high-level meeting on \r\nclimate change here at the United Nations. That \r\nmeeting was organized by the Secretary-General to \r\nhighlight the urgent need for decisions that will prevent \r\nlong-term negative consequences. Now we must all \r\nwork together towards achieving a satisfactory \r\noutcome to the Bali Conference, which is to be held at \r\nthe end of this year. \r\n I welcome the fact that the Security Council was \r\nable to adopt the groundbreaking resolution 1769 \r\n(2007), which authorized the deployment of the Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur. It is now imperative that the \r\nresolution be translated into reality. We all recognize \r\nthe difficulties involved. It is also imperative to \r\ncontinue the political process. Only a negotiated \r\nsolution has the potential to bring sustainable peace to \r\nthat long-suffering region. \r\n To a great extent, the stability and prosperity of \r\nIraq depend on support from its region. We therefore \r\nwelcome the fact that the Security Council could unite \r\nto adopt resolution 1770 (2007). That resolution gives \r\na renewed and strengthened mandate to the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission for Iraq. With the launch of \r\nthe International Compact with Iraq, last May, the \r\nworld community now possesses an effective \r\ninstrument for rendering further assistance to the areas \r\nin Iraq where it is most needed. The Compact has \r\nalready been used to achieve positive results. We \r\nencourage the Government of Iraq to continue to take \r\nsteps towards promoting economic reform and \r\nachieving peace and stability for its people. \r\n Just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Afghanistan. \r\nI had a chance to meet with President Karzai, \r\nrepresentatives of the Afghan Government, Latvian \r\ntroops and civilian experts. The message from all those \r\nmeetings was clear. Providing assistance through the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force is just one side \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 2 \r\n \r\nof the coin; the other entails contributing to building a \r\nsolid foundation for the country’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Latvia is present in Afghanistan as part of both \r\nthe international military and the civilian rebuilding \r\neffort. Latvia’s Government is contributing financially \r\nto the reconstruction of infrastructure in Afghanistan. \r\nHowever, it is my strong conviction that the key to \r\nsuccess in Afghanistan is cooperation — cooperation \r\namong countries and international organizations. To \r\nsucceed, the European Union, the United Nations, \r\nNATO and others must adopt a comprehensive, long-\r\nterm approach to development assistance for the \r\ncountry. \r\n In the Middle East, the past year has brought no \r\nsignificant breakthrough. Yet, we continue to place our \r\ntrust in the work of the Quartet, which supports the \r\nefforts of responsible regional States in helping to calm \r\nthe situation. It is a crucial tool to promote a \r\nnegotiated, comprehensive, just and lasting peace in \r\nthe Middle East, in line with the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe Security Council. I am sure that the Quartet’s \r\nnewly appointed Special Envoy will use his great \r\nexperience and make sincere efforts to fulfil his \r\nchallenging mandate. \r\n The international community is currently also \r\nseized of the matter regarding the final status of \r\nKosovo. The Secretary-General has endorsed the \r\nComprehensive Proposal of his Special Envoy Martti \r\nAhtisaari. The Proposal currently remains the only \r\nviable diplomatic solution on the table. The active \r\ninvolvement of the European Union is important to \r\nachieve a lasting solution. We urge both parties to \r\nshow flexibility and commitment to a peaceful \r\nnegotiated outcome. We sincerely hope that the \r\nongoing talks under the auspices of the Contact Group \r\ntroika will result in success. \r\n In my previous capacity as a surgeon, I \r\nperformed many operations. But I also closely \r\nfollowed the recovery process of every one of my \r\npatients. I ensured that they got the necessary post-\r\noperative treatment and encouraged them to maintain \r\nhealthy habits. In that phase I had to rely heavily on \r\nthe work of my able and dedicated team. Likewise, it is \r\nnot enough for the Security Council to prescribe \r\npeacekeeping operations, crucial as they are for \r\ninternational peace and security. The whole United \r\nNations system is necessary for the long-term recovery \r\nof conflict zones.  \r\n In that regard, I would like to pay special tribute \r\nto the peacekeepers and to the United Nations staff \r\nworking in difficult conditions on the ground. It is our \r\nduty in our capitals, and here at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters, to support their efforts, each Member \r\nState according to its capacity. At the same time, we \r\nexpect high standards in peacekeeping forces. \r\n For many decades, Latvia suffered extensively \r\nfrom foreign occupation. Now that we have regained \r\nour freedom, we hope to prevent the suffering of \r\nothers. We wish to promote the healing process. The \r\ninternational community must bring to justice those \r\nwho have committed war crimes and massive \r\nviolations of human rights. Latvia commends the work \r\nof the International Criminal Court. We have placed \r\nour hopes in the Peacebuilding Commission — that it \r\nwill be an effective tool for consolidating long-term \r\npeace. \r\n Even where military conflict is not a factor, \r\nhuman security in many parts of the world is \r\nundermined by poverty, hunger and disease. The 2007 \r\nMillennium Development Goals Report gave us some \r\ngood news. However, it warned us that the Goals will \r\nnot be achieved by the year 2015 — certainly not in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa — unless our efforts are scaled up. \r\nLatvia therefore supports the call to review progress \r\ntowards the Millennium Development Goals and \r\naccelerate action. \r\n Latvia is a candidate in the 2010 elections for the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. We have know-how to \r\nshare, and we also have empathy for the pain that \r\nreforms may cause. As an emerging donor, we have \r\nundertaken commitments in the area of overseas \r\ndevelopment assistance. We believe that our recent \r\nintensive and successful experience in development \r\nwill be an asset to the work of the Council. \r\n Latvia has a strong commitment to \r\nmultilateralism and the values embodied in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. We want to see an Organization \r\nthat embodies effectiveness, efficiency and authority. It \r\nis regrettable that the reform process launched at the \r\n2005 World Summit has been slow and uneven. We \r\nrecognize the forces that make the reform so difficult, \r\nbut we must not give in to fatigue and frustration. \r\nManagement reform is vital. I already mentioned the \r\ndire necessity for a comprehensive approach among the \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n3 07-51705 \r\n \r\ndifferent international players on the ground. Likewise, \r\nthere is a great need for system-wide coherence of the \r\nvarious United Nations funds and programmes. The \r\nprovision of aid should be targeted and efficient. Our \r\nfocus should be on those in need. We look forward to \r\nassessing the results of the “One UN” pilot \r\nprogramme, which is now under way in eight volunteer \r\ncountries. \r\n The beginnings of the new Human Rights \r\nCouncil were a cause for concern. Still, we are \r\nconfident that after making important decisions on \r\ninstitution-building earlier this year, Member States \r\nwill take full advantage of the Human Rights Council. \r\nWe have to live up to our task to further promote and \r\nprotect human rights. The Council now has the tools, \r\nbut it will be up to Member States to use those tools. It \r\nwill be up to Member States to advance the credibility \r\nof the United Nations as an Organization able and \r\nwilling to protect and promote human rights.  \r\n Latvia has always placed the promotion of human \r\nrights among its top priorities. In the light of that \r\ncommitment, we have decided to aim for membership \r\nin the Human Rights Council in the 2014 elections. \r\n No reform will be more difficult or more \r\nsignificant than that of the Security Council. The \r\nSecurity Council has had many achievements. \r\nHowever, we share the widespread belief that the \r\ncomposition and the working methods of the Council \r\nneed to be brought up to date. We have stated many \r\ntimes our reasons for supporting the model of reform \r\nbeing promoted by the G4 nations, namely, Brazil, \r\nGermany, India, and Japan. We consider it to be the \r\nbest of the models currently available. We welcome the \r\nprospect of intergovernmental negotiations beginning \r\nin the current session and hope that they will produce \r\nearly positive results. \r\n The United Nations is as important as ever, being \r\nthe only truly universal forum for global dialogue. We \r\nmust not forget that it is also the only truly universal \r\nforum for decision-making and action. But above all, \r\nwe must emphasize that this is the forum where all \r\nStates, big and small, have a voice. This is also a forum \r\nwhere all States have a responsibility to contribute.  \r\n Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Micheline Calmy-Rey, President of \r\nthe Swiss Confederation \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation. \r\n  Mrs. Micheline Calmy-Rey, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly  Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Micheline \r\nCalmy-Rey, President of the Swiss Confederation, and \r\nto invite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Calmy-Rey (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, Sir, I should like to congratulate you on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly, and to \r\nassure you of my country’s full support during the \r\nsixty-second session.  \r\n All of us here share the hope for a more peaceful \r\nand harmonious world. At a time when civilian \r\npopulations are the targets of suicide attacks and \r\nsophisticated weapons, when children are forced to \r\nbecome soldiers, and climate change poses a threat to \r\nthe survival of our planet, how are we meeting our \r\nresponsibilities? Where does the responsibility lie \r\nwhen millions of men and women are suffering from \r\nmalnutrition and their most basic needs are not being \r\nmet, when injustice is everywhere, and when the \r\nenvironment is being destroyed? How can we \r\novercome those scourges assailing human beings \r\nthroughout the world? How can we translate our \r\nresponsibilities into action?  \r\n In attempting to answer those questions, we have \r\nto acknowledge two facts. The first is that respect for \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance are \r\nthe prerequisites both to achieving lasting peace and \r\nsecurity and to protecting the environment. We know \r\nnow that systematic violations of human rights and \r\nflagrant deficiencies in the rule of law are often the \r\nsource of conflicts. The second concerns the nature of \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 4 \r\n \r\nconflicts. On the ground, battle lines are being blurred. \r\nState forces are confronting non-State armed groups. \r\nWarlords, terrorists and criminal gangs dictate the \r\nrules. Civilians rather than soldiers are the primary \r\ntargets. \r\n It is no longer possible to limit security policy to \r\nthe traditional State framework. The focus now must be \r\nfirst and foremost on the security of the individual. \r\nAccordingly, Governments and non-State armed groups \r\nalike are called on to respect certain basic rules \r\ncommon to all. \r\n If we are to achieve results, confrontation must \r\ngive way to dialogue and efforts to find solutions. \r\nNegotiation, dialogue and diplomacy are the tools for \r\nachieving success. We must overcome the barriers that \r\nexist between different sectors and disciplines in the \r\nfield of international relations. We must develop \r\nalliances based on shared values. That approach should \r\nenable us to find solutions by cutting across regional, \r\nideological and cultural boundaries. The recent past \r\nhas shown what can be achieved. The International \r\nCriminal Court, the Human Rights Council and the \r\nAnti-personnel Landmines Convention were all the \r\nresult of broad-based coalitions of countries in all \r\nregions of the world. \r\n However, dialogue alone will not be enough. \r\nExperience has shown that, without concrete \r\nobjectives, debates between players with very different \r\nviews of the world can sometimes serve to accentuate \r\ndifferences. In contrast, efforts to devise and \r\nimplement actions that are concrete and practical make \r\nfor cohabitation between different communities. It is \r\nfor that reason that Switzerland supports such \r\ninitiatives as the Alliance of Civilizations, along with \r\nthe implementation plan proposed by the secretariat of \r\nthe Alliance. \r\n Coherent overall solutions to the crises that are \r\ncurrently affecting the international order cannot be \r\nimplemented unless we take into account the interests \r\nof all the communities concerned. Switzerland does all \r\nit can to promote dialogue with all parties. That is \r\nparticularly the case in Lebanon, where we are offering \r\nthe political forces a forum in which to seek a way out \r\nof the current political crisis in the interest of long-\r\nterm stability. \r\n Recent developments in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories have reminded us once again, with tragic \r\nintensity, of the need to respect those principles. In that \r\nregard as well, the involvement of all parties is \r\nnecessary if there is to be a lasting solution. \r\n The same can be said for the situation in Darfur. \r\nMy country hopes that resolution 1769 (2007), which \r\nfor the first time envisages close cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the African Union, will provide \r\nthe inhabitants of that region with an opportunity to \r\nlive in peace and to achieve reconciliation after so \r\nmany years of suffering. \r\n The situation in Myanmar is alarming. \r\nSwitzerland calls on the Government of Myanmar to \r\nrenounce all forms of violence against demonstrators \r\nand civilians. Switzerland favours dialogue among all \r\nthe parties concerned, under the aegis of the Special \r\nAdviser of the Secretary-General. \r\n Lastly, there can be no peace or security without \r\ninternational justice. Switzerland supports in particular \r\nthe work of the International Criminal Court. Its \r\npermanent nature and the possibility of the Security \r\nCouncil referring situations to the Court — as it did in \r\nthe case of Darfur — gives that institution a preventive \r\neffect. For that effect to be achieved, the Court must \r\nhave the full support of the international community, \r\nwhich must ensure that all States cooperate fully with \r\nthe Court. \r\n Human security policy also applies to \r\nenvironmental threats. The actions of humankind have \r\nchanged the climate of the planet. Those changes are \r\ntaking place on a global scale and are resulting in \r\nrising temperatures, radical changes in precipitation \r\npatterns, rising sea levels and a disruption to the \r\nbalance of nature. Taken as a whole, those phenomena \r\npose a major threat to millions of people and the places \r\nwhere people live, their cultures and their living \r\nconditions. The risks to security, health and \r\ndevelopment are discussed in the Fourth Assessment \r\nReport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange.  \r\n Today environmental problems are a threat to \r\nsecurity. At the political level, they require that we act \r\nresponsibly as human beings. They also require the \r\nforming of alliances to protect our natural resources. \r\nAlthough we have established institutions and \r\ninternational mechanisms to combat underdevelopment \r\nand promote peace and respect for human rights, we \r\nhave not done enough with regard to the environment. \r\nIt is true that we have a series of international \r\nconventions and national programmes and legislation. \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n5 07-51705 \r\n \r\nBut environmental governance is fragmented and lacks \r\nclear objectives. We therefore need to join together to \r\nidentify and implement commitments in order to better \r\nmanage resources and efforts and to protect the \r\nbiosphere. We also need to mobilize the United Nations \r\nsystem in order to respond to climate change \r\neffectively and coherently.  \r\n Switzerland therefore hopes that we will set \r\nambitious goals for ourselves in the second phase of \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol. We are ready to make a substantial \r\ncontribution to that collective effort, in which the \r\nentire international community must join. Switzerland \r\nbelieves that, in order to have legitimacy, any future \r\ninternational regime to address climate change will \r\nrequire the participation of all countries. In our view, \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChanges and the Kyoto Protocol provide the most \r\nappropriate starting points for all deliberations and \r\nnegotiations on climate change. \r\n Addressing the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental aspects of development based on respect \r\nfor human rights is both a challenge and a goal for all \r\nof us as we seek to build a world that is both freer and \r\nmore secure. The international community has adopted \r\nmany development goals in recent decades. However, \r\nadditional efforts must still be made to ensure greater \r\ncoherence in the operational system of the United \r\nNations. With its funds, programmes and specialized \r\nagencies, the system has at its disposal an excellent \r\nnetwork through which to ensure its presence on the \r\nground. It also has great moral and technical legitimacy \r\nand substantial operational capacity.  \r\n Unfortunately the system remains fragmented and \r\nits transaction costs are very high — costs which are to \r\na great extent borne by beneficiary countries \r\nthemselves. Major adjustments — some of which are \r\ndescribed in the report entitled “Delivering as One” — \r\nneed to be carried out promptly in the field so that \r\nUnited Nations operational bodies can meet the needs \r\nof partner countries more effectively. Negotiations on \r\nthe triennial comprehensive policy review of \r\noperational activities for development of the United \r\nNations system, which are due to begin in a few weeks, \r\nwill provide the appropriate framework to determine \r\nwhat measures are needed — especially on the basis of \r\nthe experiences of pilot countries that are applying the \r\nconcept of “One United Nations”. \r\n We stand today at the midpoint of the timetable \r\nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nAlthough there is no denying that progress has been \r\nmade at various levels, there is still much to be done. \r\nAll of us — Governments, multilateral institutions, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private  \r\nsector — must combine our efforts across a wide front \r\nthat encompasses the national, regional and \r\ninternational spheres. Given the upcoming high-level \r\ndialogue on financing for development, I shall limit \r\nmyself merely to recalling that all of us have a \r\ncommon interest in improving the efficiency and the \r\nimpact of development assistance and in increasing the \r\nvolume of resources made available for it through \r\nofficial channels. We already know that results in this \r\narea can only be achieved through very considerable \r\njoint efforts by all partners concerned. \r\n The Organization has begun a process of reform \r\nin order to better respond to global challenges. So as to \r\nstrengthen the credibility and efficiency of the efforts \r\nof the United Nations, we must demonstrate our \r\ndetermination to fully carry out those reforms. There \r\nwas real progress in the past year, including the \r\nbeginning of the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Human Rights Council. That \r\nillustrates the ability of the United Nations to carry out \r\nambitious reforms in order to respond to the challenges \r\nof the twenty-first century. \r\n Switzerland is advocating for an overall \r\nimprovement in the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil. My country will continue its efforts to \r\nimprove transparency in sanctions committees and to \r\nensure that the addition and removal of names of \r\npersons and entities on sanctions lists are in conformity \r\nwith the principles of the rule of law and human rights. \r\n Efficient management and a better targeted use of \r\navailable resources continue to pose a serious \r\nchallenge for the Organization. Switzerland welcomes \r\nthe determination of the Secretary-General to make the \r\nefficiency of the United Nations system one of his \r\npriorities. Given the progress made this year, but \r\nespecially because of the challenges that remain, \r\nSwitzerland believes that it is essential to continue the \r\nprocess of reform already under way. My country will \r\ntherefore continue to support the efforts of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon aimed at strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations and making the Organization more \r\nefficient. \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 6 \r\n \r\n If we want to move ahead, if we are determined \r\nto overcome the varied and interdependent challenges \r\nfacing the globalized world of today, and if we want to \r\nfree individual human beings from fear and want, we \r\nmust focus on concrete objectives. To that end, let us \r\nresolve to work tirelessly to overcome our differences \r\nin the interest of the nations and peoples we represent. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation for the statement she has just made. \r\n Mrs. Micheline Calmy-Rey, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh \r\nAbdellahi, President of the Islamic Republic  \r\nof Mauritania \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Sidi \r\nMohamed Ould Cheikh Abdellahi, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania. \r\n Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdellahi, \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh \r\nAbdellahi, President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nMauritania, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ould Cheikh Abdellahi (spoke in \r\nArabic): I am pleased to extend my warmest \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. We have every confidence in your efforts to \r\nstrengthen peace within a global system characterized \r\nby justice, balance and stability. \r\n I would also like to congratulate your \r\npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, on her \r\nsuccessful efforts to advance debate and dialogue on \r\nthe main concerns and problems of our day. \r\n I also wish to congratulate and thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who, from the day he took \r\noffice, began to promote the reform of the \r\nOrganization, in addition to addressing international \r\npeace and security issues. \r\n Allow me, in particular, to welcome the fact that \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session focused \r\non development issues, together with the fight against \r\npoverty, the adverse effects of climate change, \r\neconomic globalization, promoting dialogue and \r\nunderstanding between civilizations and religions, \r\nintroducing modern good governance systems, and the \r\nconsolidation of democracy. \r\n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhich is an urgent priority, requires that we all \r\nintensify our efforts and promote cooperation and \r\ncoordination so as to establish conditions conducive to \r\nsustainable, comprehensive and balanced development. \r\n We believe that encouraging the spirit and values \r\nof understanding, dialogue and complementarity \r\nbetween civilizations and nations, upholding the rule of \r\nlaw, and expanding justice and equity are the speediest \r\nway to ensure peace and security in the world and \r\neradicate hatred and confrontation between peoples. \r\nThe continuation of seemingly intractable problems, \r\nthe widening of the gap between rich and poor, the \r\nexistence of structural dysfunctions in the global \r\neconomy, the absence of justice, and the prevalence of \r\ninjustice and despair are factors that perpetuate pockets \r\nof tension and conflict and encourage extremism and \r\nterrorism. \r\n We in Mauritania have rejected terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations. We strongly condemn it and, \r\nat the same time, we continue to adhere to Islamic \r\nvalues in our society — which are based on tolerance \r\nand the rejection of violence and extremism and call \r\nfor understanding and brotherhood.  \r\n Under the Charter of the United Nations we are \r\ncommitted to join efforts to maintain international \r\npeace and security. That commitment continues to be \r\nundermined by conflict situations, some of which have \r\npersisted since the founding of the Organization. The \r\nArab-Israeli conflict is undeniably the one that \r\ngenerates the most antagonism and most threatens \r\ninternational peace and security. That conflict \r\ncontinues despite the fact that the framework setting \r\nout the general conditions for a just, comprehensive \r\nand lasting settlement of the conflict has been defined \r\nand reaffirmed over the years by the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly. Those basic requirements \r\nconstitute the very essence of the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\nThat Initiative guarantees peace, security and the \r\nrecognition of the State of Israel by Arab countries in \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n7 07-51705 \r\n \r\nexchange for an end to the occupation of Arab \r\nterritories and an agreement to seek out mutually \r\nacceptable solutions for other outstanding issues. Israel \r\nmust seize this historic opportunity and subsequently \r\ncomply with international law so that the peoples of the \r\nregion can at last live in peace — and in particular so \r\nthat the Palestinian people can regain their usurped \r\nrights and be able to establish an independent State, \r\nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. \r\n Mauritania is of course following closely the \r\nissue of the Western Sahara. We are pleased with the \r\nrecent steps that have led to the resumption of direct \r\nnegotiations. We reiterate our support for the efforts of \r\nthe Secretary-General to find a definitive solution \r\nacceptable to all parties that guarantees stability in the \r\nregion.  \r\n With regard to Darfur, we are pleased about the \r\nagreement reached between the Government of the \r\nSudan, the African Union and the United Nations. We \r\nhope that all parties will join efforts to ensure that \r\npeace, understanding and accord prevail as soon as \r\npossible among our Sudanese brothers and sisters. \r\n As for the situation in Côte d’Ivoire, we were \r\npleased to note the remarkable progress made on the \r\npath towards civic peace in the country. We hope that \r\noverall stability will prevail in that brotherly country \r\nand that it will once again assume its rightful place in \r\nthe West African subregion and in the continent as a \r\nwhole. \r\n The African Union, working with the United \r\nNations, is making intensive efforts to resolve the \r\ncrises on the African continent. However, social and \r\neconomic progress undoubtedly offers the best solution \r\nto those conflicts. Africa’s share of the world economy \r\nhas declined in the past two decades. The continent \r\nnow lags behind in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Yet, there are real signs of \r\nimprovement in the situation on the continent. New \r\neconomic opportunities now exist, thanks in large part \r\nto the growing demand for emerging markets, but \r\nAfrica still needs further official development \r\nassistance and greater flows of foreign direct \r\ninvestment. I should like to point out that African \r\ncountries are of course primarily responsible for their \r\nown development. They must also ensure the rule of \r\nlaw, promote good governance and establish a \r\nframework conducive to direct foreign investment.  \r\n This year, we in Mauritania improved the \r\ndemocratic process by establishing a pluralistic system \r\nbased on a Constitution that guarantees the right of the \r\npeaceful transfer of power. Our country has therefore \r\nundergone a major democratic transformation. We have \r\ndone so through presidential elections conducted in an \r\natmosphere of transparency, honesty and open \r\ncompetition — as was noted by national and \r\ninternational observers, including the United Nations, \r\nthe European Union, the League of Arab States, the \r\nAfrican Union, the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. In the same atmosphere of freedom and \r\npluralism, municipal and legislative elections made it \r\npossible to choose the representatives of the people to \r\nmunicipal councils and the two houses of Parliament. \r\nWe paid particular attention to Mauritania’s women in \r\nboth elections, with 20 per cent of contested seats \r\nreserved for them. As a result, women are now more \r\nrepresented than ever in the legislative and executive \r\nbranches, as well as in local administration, diplomacy \r\nand management.  \r\n Moreover, my Government has made sustained \r\nefforts to strengthen national unity and to ensure \r\ntransparency in the management of public affairs. \r\nAmong other things, those efforts have led to steps to \r\nsecure the dignified return of Mauritanian refugees \r\nresiding in Senegal and Mali, so as to usher in a new \r\nera of brotherhood and national reconciliation in our \r\ncountry.  \r\n In the same vein, we have enacted a law \r\ncriminalizing slavery. A high court of justice was also \r\nestablished in order, if necessary, to prosecute the \r\npresident of the country and senior Government \r\nofficials through an integral procedure that aims at \r\ninstitutionalizing the norms of good governance, \r\nmodernizing institutions and strengthening the \r\noversight mechanism through greater and direct \r\nparticipation by the representatives of the people and \r\nof civil society. We are more determined than ever to \r\npersevere along this path because we believe it is the \r\nbest way to strengthen national unity and achieve \r\ndevelopment, security, stability and prosperity for the \r\nnation and for our citizens.  \r\n Mauritania is resolutely committed to \r\ncontributing to relations of cooperation and solidarity \r\nin our region, in accordance with the ambitions and \r\naspirations of our people. In this framework, our faith \r\nin the Arab Maghreb Union as a strategic choice for the \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 8 \r\n \r\nregion and our faith in the Arab League and the African \r\nUnion are unwavering, given our firm commitment to \r\nthe spirit of fraternity and solidarity and to relations of \r\ncooperation, friendship and good neighbourliness that \r\nlink our country to its Arab and African environment. \r\nAt the same time, our country remains determined to \r\nstrengthen the bases of dialogue, exchange and \r\nunderstanding between peoples and civilizations, \r\nnamely within the framework of the  \r\nEuro-Mediterranean dialogue.  \r\n Mauritania reiterates its commitment to the ideals \r\nand purposes of the United Nations, the only \r\nmultilateral framework at the service of humanity as a \r\nwhole. Faced with the multiple challenges and threats \r\nin today’s world, it is our common duty to make the \r\nUnited Nations a melting pot where we can harmonize \r\nour efforts to implement the priorities stated in the \r\nMillennium Declaration and at various international \r\nconferences. In a globalized world marked by the \r\naccumulation of wealth and an unprecedented \r\nacceleration of technological and scientific progress, it \r\nis up to us to benefit equitably from the possibilities \r\nthat are offered to all peoples and to establish the best \r\nliving conditions coupled with greater freedom. We \r\ntook this commitment when we created the United \r\nNations more than 60 years ago. Today we have the \r\nmeans to assume our responsibilities and to uphold this \r\noften reiterated commitment.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the statement he \r\nhas just made.  \r\n Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdellahi, \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Tarja Halonen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Finland \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Finland.  \r\n Mrs. Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Tarja Halonen, President \r\nof the Republic of Finland, and to invite her to address \r\nthe Assembly.  \r\n President Halonen: I would like to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, and express our support for your \r\nleadership of the General Assembly at this session. \r\nFinland aligns itself with the statement of the European \r\nUnion. \r\n The Millennium Declaration and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals continue to serve as our common \r\npledge to create a better future for everyone. The \r\nUnited Nations is our world organization, and in \r\naddressing global challenges, the United Nations is the \r\nkey forum for our cooperation. \r\n In order to achieve comprehensive security, we \r\nmust strive not only for security, but also for \r\ndevelopment and human rights. In the World Summit \r\ntwo years ago, we decided that the United Nations \r\nsystem should be reformed to better ensure the \r\nimplementation of these three fundamental principles. \r\nWe should spare no efforts to continue the overall \r\nreform of the United Nations. \r\n A more just world is a safer world. Making the \r\nEconomic and Social Council more effective is an \r\nimportant part of the United Nations reform and of the \r\nconcept of broad security. \r\n Establishing a new United Nations institution is \r\ntruly a challenging task. We know that from our own \r\nexperience. Finland was a member of the Human \r\nRights Council during its first year. But we have to go \r\non. We must sustain our efforts to make the Council a \r\ncredible institution, capable of defending and \r\npromoting globally the human rights of women, men \r\nand children. Our good words and intentions must lead \r\nto strong action. \r\n The new Peacebuilding Commission must be \r\ndeveloped into a platform that can successfully assist \r\ncountries struggling in post-conflict situations. To \r\nsupport that work, Governments, parliaments,  \r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector \r\nmust also work together. The Peacebuilding Fund must \r\nbe used as an effective tool to respond to the \r\nimmediate needs of post-conflict countries. \r\n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\ncalls for coherent action. Finland strongly supports the \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General’s High-\r\nlevel Panel on System-wide Coherence. The objective \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n9 07-51705 \r\n \r\nof One United Nations at the country level is worth \r\nstriving for. \r\n We also must reinforce our efforts to address the \r\nchallenges in the fields of health and education, as so \r\nmany speakers have mentioned here. \r\n Finland warmly welcomes the Panel’s \r\nrecommendations concerning gender. We do need to \r\ntake decisive measures to promote gender awareness \r\nacross the entire United Nations system. We support \r\nthe proposal to set up a new, consolidated gender \r\nagency with a new Under-Secretary-General position at \r\nits head. \r\n In this context, I would like to stress the \r\nimportance of engaging women in all phases of crisis \r\nmanagement: conflict prevention, peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding, without forgetting peace talks. Let me \r\ngive one example: the United Nations Development \r\nFund for Women (UNIFEM) Middle East Initiative. I \r\nbelieve that the cooperation between Israeli and \r\nPalestinian women under this initiative can help to \r\nrestart the peace negotiations. I also use this \r\nopportunity to state that Finland is preparing its \r\nnational action plan to advance the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \r\npeace and security. \r\n A stronger United Nations also needs reform of \r\nthe Secretariat. In this regard, we welcome the \r\nadditional emphasis given to the rule of law. Support \r\nfor the rule of law is a necessity in the consolidation of \r\nglobal security. \r\n Sustainable development requires us to \r\nconsistently promote fairer globalization and the well-\r\nbeing of nature. Climate change affects the future of \r\nthe whole of mankind. Finland highlights the necessity \r\nto reach, as soon as possible, a globally inclusive \r\nagreement on the post-2012 climate regime. The \r\nUnited Nations has a central role to play in this \r\nprocess. \r\n Every nation has the right to develop and to aim \r\nfor growth and prosperity. Industrialized countries \r\nmust demonstrate solidarity with developing countries \r\nand take all possible steps to promote access to \r\nenvironmentally sound technologies for everyone. \r\n I believe that the tone of the climate change \r\ndebate is developing in a promising direction. Many \r\nMember States and various regions and social actors \r\nhave become active and have produced initiatives \r\nconcerning the development of climate policy. We have \r\nto take advantage of that as an asset in the run-up to \r\nthe Bali Climate Change Conference, to be held in \r\nDecember. \r\n The high-level event on climate change held on \r\n24 September was a success. I feel that it gave us the \r\npolitical support that we will need when we are \r\nheading towards Bali. Everyone’s input will, of course, \r\nbe required. Finland appreciates the fact that the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly has made this topic \r\none of his priorities. \r\n We need effective international cooperation in the \r\nfield of disarmament and non-proliferation. For \r\nexample, given the number of victims in today’s \r\nconflicts, small arms and light weapons are indeed \r\nweapons of mass destruction. Finland, together with \r\nmore than 150 other States, supports the process aimed \r\nat the adoption of an international arms trade treaty. \r\n The role of the United Nations is vital in \r\nresolving numerous crises around the world. This \r\nmorning, we heard news from Burma/Myanmar, where \r\nthe people’s fight for freedom and human rights has \r\nbeen suppressed. We must react. United Nations \r\nactivities need political support and our resources. \r\n We value the determination of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in searching for a solution to the crisis in the \r\nSudan. The new peacekeeping operation in Darfur will \r\nincrease the total number of United Nations troops to \r\nmore than 100,000. That remarkable figure proves that \r\nthe United Nations enjoys the trust of the international \r\ncommunity. We welcome Security Council resolution \r\n1778 (2007), adopted yesterday, on an international \r\npresence in Chad and the Central African Republic. \r\n In order to achieve success in crisis management, \r\nwe need partnerships and shared responsibilities. For \r\nexample, the African Union and the European Union \r\nhave been valuable partners of the United Nations. The \r\nsupport of local and regional actors is critical for \r\nsuccessful United Nations peacekeeping. \r\n We Europeans believe that resolving Kosovo’s \r\nstatus is vitally important. In that process, the United \r\nNations Special Envoy has played a pivotal role. We \r\nencourage all parties to engage constructively in \r\nfinding a solution to that problem. \r\n Let me assure the Assembly that Finland supports \r\na stronger United Nations for a better world. It is up to \r\nus to deliver on our commitments to achieving better \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 10 \r\n \r\nsecurity, sustainable development and respect for the \r\nhuman rights of all people. I wish to express our \r\nfirmest support to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, in pursuing such efforts. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Finland for the statement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, \r\nPresident of Turkmenistan \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of Turkmenistan. \r\n Mr. Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, President \r\nof Turkmenistan, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Gurbanguly \r\nBerdymukhammedov, President of Turkmenistan, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Berdymukhammedov (spoke in \r\nRussian): On behalf of the people and the Government \r\nof Turkmenistan, I wish to express my good wishes to \r\nall members and to congratulate them on the beginning \r\nof the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his election to the post of \r\nSecretary-General and to wish him every success in \r\ndischarging his challenging responsibilities. \r\n I should also like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim on his election to the presidency of the \r\nAssembly. I am certain that under his guidance, the \r\nwork of the Assembly will be effective and fruitful.  \r\n Since the very first days of its independence, \r\nTurkmenistan has considered the ideals of the United \r\nNations to be fully in accordance with our aspirations \r\nin terms of relations with the international community. \r\nThe basic principles of the Organization — the \r\nmaintenance of peace, equality of rights, respect for the \r\nsovereignty of all States and their right to choose their \r\nown path of development — formed the basis for our \r\ncountry’s foreign policy, in which cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations has become a priority area. \r\n Time has proved that the choice made by our \r\ncountry was right and well founded. In 15 years of \r\nintense cooperation with the United Nations, \r\nTurkmenistan has found its own place in the \r\ninternational arena and has gained invaluable \r\nexperience in interacting with the world community \r\nand developing harmonious, equal and mutually \r\nrespectful relations with other nations. We have every \r\nright to be proud of the fact that it was within these \r\nwalls that resolution 50/80 [A], on the permanent \r\nneutrality of Turkmenistan, was adopted on \r\n12 December 1995 — a historic event for our country. \r\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that the resolution on \r\nneutrality has become the foundation of our foreign \r\npolicy and has played a major role in shaping our \r\nnational policy. \r\n Cooperation with the United Nations will \r\ncontinue to drive our foreign policy. Here, I should like \r\nto emphasize that such cooperation enriches our \r\nbilateral and multilateral ties and makes them more \r\nmeaningful. That is most apparent in regional matters, \r\nwhere the participation of the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies promotes convergence of States’ \r\napproaches to issues, thus creating a favourable \r\npolitical, diplomatic and legal environment for their \r\nresolution through concerted effort. \r\n In that context, I consider the recent decision to \r\nestablish a United Nations Regional Centre for \r\nPreventive Diplomacy in Central Asia to be a major \r\nmilestone. I am confident that the inauguration of the \r\nCentre, set for the end of the year, will mark an entirely \r\nnew phase in the efforts of our country and our \r\nneighbours to ensure peace, security and stability in the \r\nregion. \r\n Turkmenistan is fully prepared to engage in \r\nconstructive and fruitful cooperation with the Centre. \r\nWe are certain that its work will be a strong and \r\npositive force in resolving the problems faced by our \r\nregion. We highly appreciate the decision to establish \r\nthe Centre in Ashgabat, capital of neutral \r\nTurkmenistan. We see that as an expression of the \r\nOrganization’s confidence in our country. Mindful of \r\nour great responsibility, I assure the Assembly that our \r\ncountry will do everything necessary to make the \r\nCentre’s work effective and fruitful. \r\n Notwithstanding current changes in the world, the \r\ngreat humanist ideals of the United Nations and the \r\nprinciples of its Charter should continue to serve as the \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n11 07-51705 \r\n \r\nmoral and legal pillar of the international order. Only \r\non this basis can the issues of United Nations reform \r\nbe considered. United Nations reform as a whole \r\nshould be meaningful and goal-oriented and \r\ncorrespond to the objective realities of the age. In this \r\nrespect, Turkmenistan supports the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations Member States and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to make the work of the Organization more \r\ndynamic, efficient, transparent and democratic. \r\n In that context, Turkmenistan shares the view that \r\nit is necessary to improve further the structure of the \r\nSecurity Council and to develop closer and more \r\neffective interaction between the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly. We are in favour of reforming \r\nthe United Nations, making it stronger, enhancing its \r\nwork and expanding the role and functions of the \r\nSecurity Council as a guarantor of international peace, \r\nsecurity and stability. \r\n Turkmenistan’s neutral status, its foreign policy \r\ndoctrine of non-affiliation with any blocs and its \r\nrejection of the use of force as a means of resolving \r\ninternational disputes predetermine our stance with \r\nregard to the issues of peace and security. In this \r\ncontext, Turkmenistan fully supports international \r\nefforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, their delivery systems and related \r\ntechnologies. Accordingly, Turkmenistan has been \r\ntaking and will continue to take consistent practical \r\nsteps to ensure implementation of the international \r\nlegal framework on the non-proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. In its legislation, Turkmenistan \r\nproclaims its refusal to possess, manufacture, store or \r\ntransport nuclear, chemical, bacteriological and other \r\ntypes of weapons of mass destruction or related \r\ntechnologies. In 2005, the People’s Council of \r\nTurkmenistan decided to adopt a Statement on \r\nSupporting the Initiatives of International \r\nOrganizations to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons \r\nof Mass Destruction. Last year, in Semipalatinsk, \r\nTurkmenistan, together with other States of the region, \r\nsigned the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in \r\nCentral Asia. That document is unique in many ways, \r\nsince, for the first time since the Second World War, it \r\nproclaims the establishment of a vast region free of \r\nnuclear weapons on the map of the northern \r\nhemisphere. It is noteworthy that our joint initiative \r\nechoes the aspirations of the majority of countries and \r\nthat it has been highly acclaimed by the international \r\ncommunity and endorsed by the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly. Let me take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our appreciation to all States, international and \r\nregional organizations that have supported the \r\ndocument. \r\n However, we need to realize that Central Asia is \r\nnot isolated. Our region has thousands of historical, \r\nethnic and humanitarian ties with neighbouring States. \r\nIn this context, Turkmenistan’s concern with the events \r\nin Afghanistan is justified. We rejoice at the success of \r\nthe Afghan people in building a peaceful life; we feel \r\nthe difficulties they face as our own. Turkmenistan is \r\nassisting Afghanistan in rebuilding its economy, by \r\nproviding professional training, in the construction of \r\nsocial facilities and by providing oil and power to some \r\nprovinces of the country. Together with the \r\ninternational community, and with the United Nations, \r\nwe are striving to help achieve stability for Afghanistan \r\nand to help the brotherly people of that country to \r\nachieve peace and well-being. \r\n Geographically, Turkmenistan is conveniently \r\nlocated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Over its \r\nyears of independence, our country has built a modern \r\ntransportation and communication infrastructure. As an \r\nimportant element of international trade and economic \r\nrelations, it may also become a factor leading to \r\nsignificant revitalization and further development of \r\ncultural interaction between the regions, thus \r\npromoting rapprochement and mutual understanding \r\nbetween nations. It is in that spirit that Turkmenistan \r\ndefines its international energy strategy, aimed at \r\ndeveloping a multiple pipeline system to bring \r\nTurkmen energy resources to international markets on \r\na stable and long-term basis. This strategy is not \r\ndependent on either political circumstances or any kind \r\nof ideological bias. Our stand on this matter is a stand \r\nof principle and full transparency. We support the \r\nimplementation of economically justified pipeline \r\nprojects that would guarantee security, including \r\nenvironmental safety. That will determine their multi-\r\ntrack character. In this context, Turkmenistan is in \r\nfavour of the mutually advantageous use of energy \r\nresources by both exporters and consumers. \r\n From this point of view, we are convinced that \r\nthe implementation of projects aimed at bringing \r\nTurkmen energy to international markets will provide \r\nanother impulse to stimulate inter-State and \r\ninterregional trade and economic relations. That will \r\nalso serve to promote further economic growth in the \r\ncountries where pipelines run and assist in the \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 12 \r\n \r\nresolution of issues relating to the provision of light \r\nand heat, the development of production and social \r\ninfrastructure and job creation, which will, ultimately, \r\nhave a positive effect on the overall political climate \r\nwithin and beyond the region. \r\n Turkmenistan is taking very seriously the issue of \r\nenvironmental protection and a whole range of other \r\nissues that will have to be addressed by engaging the \r\ncapacity of the international community at large. In this \r\ncontext, we support the efforts of the Secretary-General \r\nto promote and develop broad international \r\ncooperation, with a view to finding a comprehensive \r\nsolution to this global problem. To that end, \r\nTurkmenistan is taking specific steps at the national \r\nlevel. Up to 200 million dollars are annually earmarked \r\nin the national budget for environmental protection. \r\nOur country has passed legislation setting standards to \r\nprevent environmental pollution, and it is introducing \r\ntechnologies to ensure environmental safety of our key \r\nsector, the oil and gas industry. Already for over 10 \r\nyears, Turkmenistan has been implementing a large-\r\nscale nation-wide programme entitled “The Green \r\nBelt”, which has resulted in millions of trees being \r\nplanted on thousands of hectares all over the country. \r\n We are fully committed to the goals of the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, and we are ready to cooperate with all \r\ninternational partners in implementing its provisions. \r\n As a full-fledged member of the international \r\ncommunity, Turkmenistan is developing a genuinely \r\ndemocratic and legal foundation for its national \r\nstatehood. The greatest value of our society is the \r\nindividual, and his or her rights and freedoms. Today, \r\nthis is at the centre of our State policy. \r\n Processes aimed at the further democratization of \r\npublic and political life, the establishment of civil \r\nsociety, the introduction of modern electoral \r\nmechanisms and the formation of local government \r\nbodies are gaining momentum. A constructive \r\ninnovative search for a reasonable balance between the \r\nauthority of the State and society at large is under way. \r\nWe are not trying to speed up the process, and we are \r\nnot pushing it into some artificial time frame. The most \r\nimportant thing is that it has become irreversible and is \r\nreceiving recognition and support both within and \r\noutside the country. And, in this respect, we highly \r\nappreciate the assistance provided to us by \r\ninternational organizations in general and by the \r\nUnited Nations in particular. \r\n Today, Turkmenistan is open to the world; it is \r\nopen to broad-scale partnership in all areas of activity. \r\nTogether with the rest of the community of nations, our \r\ncountry is ready to work further to promote the \r\nprinciples of international law and the ideals of \r\nhumanism, justice, tolerance and mutual respect as \r\ndeterminant factors in modern relations among States. \r\n The status of permanent neutrality not only \r\nimposes on our country important foreign policy \r\nobligations but also obliges us to shape our foreign and \r\nsocial policies accordingly. In that context, I would like \r\nto emphasize that Turkmenistan’s neutrality is \r\nirreversible and that our commitment to the resultant \r\ninternational obligations is firm. We intend to follow \r\nthis path with resolve, and we will always be open to \r\ninternational cooperation promoting implementation of \r\nthe strategic priorities of the community of nations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nTurkmenistan for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, President \r\nof Turkmenistan, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n Mr. Rosselli (Uruguay), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania.  \r\n  Mr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the Republic of \r\nLithuania, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Valdas Adamkus, President of the Republic of \r\nLithuania, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Adamkus: It is always inspiring to \r\ncome to this forum and, time and again, observe that \r\nthere are many more things that unite rather than divide \r\nnations around the globe. Indeed, we are united in our \r\nvision of a world free of violence, where every \r\nindividual has freedom of choice and where human \r\ndignity is respected. We are united in our aspirations to \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n13 07-51705 \r\n \r\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century, because \r\nwe know that in a globalized world a threat to one \r\nnation is a threat to all nations. \r\n Nowhere is this new reality more evident than in \r\nthe much-needed work of the United Nations. Poverty, \r\nimbalances in development, armaments, the spread of \r\nideologies of hatred, cybercrime: those are some of the \r\nthreats that we face today. The new, daunting \r\nchallenges are different in kind. Therefore, both \r\nindividual States and the international community have \r\nto find ways to deal with this new reality and how to \r\nrespond better to new challenges. \r\n Seven years ago, at this United Nations conclave, \r\nall nations made a historic step, pledging to eradicate \r\npoverty, illiteracy and environmental degradation, and \r\nto improve health and promote gender equality. That \r\nwas our response to the challenges of the time. This \r\nyear, we are halfway to the 2015 deadline for achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Over the \r\npast few years, an estimated 135 million people \r\nmanaged to get out of extreme poverty. Significant \r\npositive changes are taking place in the fields of \r\nprimary education for poor children, child vaccination \r\nand better access to retroviral treatment for persons \r\nwith HIV/AIDS, to name but a few. \r\n Yet overall progress in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals remains uneven and too slow. If \r\nwe want to live up to our commitments, we must \r\nincrease our efforts considerably and urgently. \r\n The twenty-first century has also confronted us \r\nwith such challenges as a deteriorating environment. \r\nGlobal warming affects all aspects of our lives from \r\nsocial and economic growth to changing habitats and \r\nmigration patterns. Time is clearly not on our side. We \r\nare taking measures to adapt our policies to counter \r\nclimate change, but our actions are obviously too slow \r\nand sometimes too reluctant. Therefore, Lithuania \r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s focus on climate \r\nchange as a global challenge that requires global \r\nconcerted efforts. We believe that the United Nations \r\nclimate change process is the appropriate forum for \r\nnegotiating future global action in this effort. \r\n But that already may not be enough. I am \r\nconvinced that the world needs a more coherent and \r\ninclusive system of international environmental \r\ngovernance. This system needs to be strengthened by \r\nestablishing a United Nations Environment \r\nOrganization, based on the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) with a revised \r\nmandate. With December’s Bali climate change \r\nconference in mind, I call on all countries to come to \r\nthe negotiating table later this year with the ambition \r\nof concluding by 2009 a global and comprehensive \r\npost-2012 agreement. Before such an agreement is \r\nreached, Lithuania is doing its best to fulfil the \r\ncommitment of the European Union to achieve at least \r\na 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by \r\n2020 compared to 1990 levels. \r\n We have started to focus on a wider use of \r\nindigenous and renewable energy resources. The share \r\nof these resources in the primary energy balance in \r\nLithuania will increase up to 12 per cent by the year \r\n2010. Last year alone, we planted 21,000 hectares of \r\ntrees, an area that corresponds to 32,000 soccer fields. \r\nFor a country the size of Lithuania, that is no small \r\nmeasure. These are but a few of the concrete steps by \r\nwhich my country shows political will sufficient to \r\nfight new global challenges. \r\n The necessity to fit in and effectively integrate \r\ninto the international system has been the cornerstone \r\nof our policies since we regained our independence in \r\n1990. Membership in the European Union and NATO \r\nis the best example of success in that effort. Now we \r\nare taking on increasing responsibility in the fields of \r\nsecurity, stability and sustainability in our region and \r\nbeyond. We are active at the front of the war against \r\nterrorism, including our contribution to restoring \r\nstability and security in Iraq. We are leading a \r\nProvincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan’s Ghor \r\nprovince. Over the past two years, Lithuania has \r\ndoubled its development aid budget and has committed \r\nto increasing it to 0.33 per cent of its gross national \r\nincome by 2015. Our contribution to global security \r\nand the vision of inclusiveness and of building a \r\n“Europe whole and free” motivated Lithuania to offer \r\nits candidacy for the chairmanship of the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2010. \r\n If Lithuania and the Baltic region in general are a \r\nsuccess story in terms of establishing themselves in a \r\nnew global environment, some countries in our region \r\nare not. We may only guess why those countries \r\nperceive the integration of democracies on their \r\nborders as a national threat. We feel sorry for a society \r\nat large when its Government chooses to spend the \r\ncountry’s natural riches on guns and not on democratic \r\nreforms. Clearly, we should not tolerate attempts to \r\nfalsify historical facts about the Soviet occupation of \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 14 \r\n \r\nthe Baltic States or the denial of the deliberately \r\ncaused Holodomor in Ukraine, which killed millions. \r\n Fitting in is never easy. Therefore, we consider \r\nthat the United Nations could help Member States to \r\nefficiently integrate into the international system, as \r\nthe European Union is already doing by engaging its \r\nneighbours in this process through various \r\nneighbourhood instruments and cooperation formats. \r\n However, our readiness to stand up and speak \r\nopenly to States if they cross the line is also an \r\nindispensable element of that effort. We should ask \r\nourselves: where did we fail, that the killings of \r\nhundreds of thousands of innocent people were \r\npermitted to take place in Darfur?  \r\n Today conflicts occur on every continent, with \r\nparticularly grave consequences in Africa and the \r\nMiddle East. Some conflicts in the world, however, are \r\nless visible. But that does not make them less \r\ndangerous. Frozen conflicts in Eastern Europe and the \r\nSouth Caucasus may become very hot one day unless \r\nwe act immediately. We consider it morally \r\nunacceptable for the international community to remain \r\nindifferent to the frozen conflicts in the GUAM area. \r\nLet us not forget that it is not only the conflicts that are \r\nfrozen; the lives and dreams of the people living in \r\nthose areas of artificial conflict are also frozen. That is \r\nwhere the United Nations should be more visible and \r\nmore outspoken. That also applies to Kosovo, where \r\nattempts to create another frozen conflict must be \r\nexcluded. \r\n It is not only States, but also the United Nations \r\nitself that must adapt to new, changing realities. We \r\nencourage the Secretary-General to continue the reform \r\nof the United Nations, in particular making the \r\nOrganization’s operational system more consolidated, \r\ncoherent and effective, with the highest standards of \r\nconduct and ethics. We must proceed with real actions \r\nin carrying through the reform of the United Nations. \r\nThe Secretary-General has my full support in this \r\ncontext. He should be applauded for his bold and \r\nforward-thinking vision of the reform in United \r\nNations peacekeeping. We welcome all efforts by the \r\nUnited Nations to streamline and reform the \r\npeacekeeping procurement system. \r\n I encourage the United Nations to further \r\nstrengthen, develop and use its capabilities in the area \r\nof good offices and conflict prevention, as envisioned \r\nin the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). \r\nThat would enable us to address many issues in a more \r\nefficient manner and, hopefully, to avoid costly \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n The prevention of nuclear proliferation and the \r\npursuit of nuclear disarmament in accordance with the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nare crucial for global peace and security. We need to \r\nstrengthen the authority of the Treaty. Lithuania will \r\nsupport the process leading to the elaboration of a \r\nbinding international arms trade treaty. Lithuania will \r\nalso continue to increase practical assistance and \r\nfunding to international mine action projects and the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action on Small \r\nArms and Light Weapons. \r\n Two years have passed since the adoption of the \r\nWorld Summit Outcome, which elaborated on the \r\nconcept of the responsibility to protect, and yet we \r\nhave been too slow in responding to massive violations \r\nof human rights and mass atrocities. The principle of \r\nthe responsibility to protect can no longer be confined \r\nto paper. We therefore encourage the Secretary-General \r\nto follow up on the World Summit document and take \r\nmeasures to operationalize that principle. \r\n Only a reformed and proactive United Nations \r\nwill be truly instrumental and effective. Only such a \r\nUnited Nations will have the required support and \r\nfinancing. Only such a United Nations will be trusted \r\nby the people. \r\n The ability to adapt is the quality of the strong. \r\nFitting in is the least we can do for future generations. \r\nIt is the responsibility of every nation and the \r\ninternational community as such.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Valdus Adamkus, President of the Republic of \r\nLithuania, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President \r\nof the Republic of Zambia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia. \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n15 07-51705 \r\n \r\n Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome His Excellency Mr. Levy Patrick \r\nMwanawasa, President of the Republic of Zambia, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mwanawasa: Allow me at the outset \r\nto convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session. My delegation is \r\nconfident that with his immense wealth of experience, \r\nhe will steer the session very successfully. Zambia \r\nassures him of its total support during his tenure of \r\noffice. \r\n Let me, at this point, pay tribute to Mr. Kurt \r\nWaldheim, the fourth Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, and later President of Austria, who died on  \r\n14 June 2007. To us, he was a great diplomat who \r\nmade Africa one of his priorities, especially at the \r\nheight of the liberation struggle in Southern Africa. \r\n May I take this opportunity to thank Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Rashed Al Khalifa of Bahrain for \r\nhaving presided over the affairs of the sixty-first \r\nsession in an exemplary manner. Among her \r\naccomplishments was the carrying forward of the \r\nUnited Nations reforms called for at the 2005 World \r\nSummit. It was gratifying to have a lady preside over \r\nthe highest office of the General Assembly after almost \r\nthree decades of male dominance. I hope that this \r\norgan will not again take that long to have an excellent \r\nwoman as President. \r\n Let me now congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon of the \r\nRepublic of Korea on his election as the eighth \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. I am \r\nconfident that he will build upon the strong foundation \r\nthat was laid by his predecessor, Kofi Annan of Ghana, \r\nto whom I wish to pay tribute for the manner in which \r\nhe steered the Organization during his tenure in office. \r\nHe made Africa proud, and I wish him success in his \r\ncurrent and future endeavours. \r\n Our world today presents many challenges. These \r\ninclude abject poverty for the majority of the world’s \r\ninhabitants, underdevelopment, conflict, human \r\ntrafficking, climate change, terrorism, violations of \r\nhuman rights, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and gender \r\ninequality. While some of these challenges have only \r\nrecently emerged, others have been with us from time \r\nimmemorial. These challenges cannot be entirely \r\nresolved within national boundaries or at the regional \r\nlevel. They can be resolved only at the multilateral \r\nlevel, with all the players carrying out their roles \r\ndiligently. For that reason, Zambia supports a strong \r\nand coherent United Nations. We agree with the \r\nrecommendation of the High-level Panel on United \r\nNations System-wide Coherence that the United \r\nNations urgently needs more coherence and synergy. \r\nThat will enable it to perform as one and to use its \r\nunique universality, neutrality and capacity to operate \r\nefficiently. \r\n Furthermore, Zambia supports the ongoing \r\nreforms of the United Nations. In particular, we \r\nwelcome the mandate given to the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to make it more effective in executing \r\nits duties, which include formulating policy \r\nrecommendations on international and social issues, as \r\nwell as coordinating activities of specialized agencies \r\nin the economic, social and related fields. In that \r\nregard, collaboration of the United Nations with the \r\ninternational financial institutions and the World Trade \r\nOrganization should be further enhanced; we welcome \r\nthe work going on in this area. \r\n This brings me to another issue: reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. This matter has remained unresolved \r\nfor more than a decade. United Nations reform cannot \r\nbe complete without meaningful reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. Any new proposals to reform that vital organ \r\nshould seriously consider Africa’s call to have two \r\npermanent seats with full veto power. Africa is aware \r\nthat the veto is an undemocratic instrument and would \r\nprefer to do away with it altogether. However, as long \r\nas others insist on keeping the veto, Africa should have \r\nit as well. The status quo is unacceptable. It is my hope \r\nthat during Mr. Kerim’s tenure of office, this aspect of \r\nthe reform process will be concluded successfully. \r\n The issue of climate change is very important to \r\nthe current and future inhabitants of our planet. It is \r\ntherefore fitting that one theme of this session is \r\nresponding to climate change. I commend the \r\nSecretary-General for organizing the 24 September \r\n2007 high-level event on this matter. Indeed, the \r\neffects of climate change are being felt mostly by the \r\ndeveloping countries. For instance, Southern Africa is \r\nexperiencing critical food shortages due to torrential \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 16 \r\n \r\nrains in some areas and severe drought in other parts of \r\nthe region. \r\n The problem of climate change is a global issue \r\nrequiring global action within the multilateral context \r\nof the United Nations. As a signatory to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the Kyoto Protocol, Zambia has already taken \r\nseveral measures to implement those international \r\ninstruments. In that regard, we submitted our first \r\nnational communication report in 2004. We have also \r\ntaken deliberate steps to create public awareness about \r\nthe problem of climate change so that our people can \r\ndevise appropriate local interventions. \r\n Regarding measures aimed at adapting to climate \r\nchange, Zambia has just finished formulating its \r\nNational Adaptation Programme of Action. The \r\nprogramme will help us identify the most vulnerable \r\nsectors of our economy, as well as adaptation activities \r\nrequired to alleviate the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange. For this reason, we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that the Adaptation Fund under \r\nthe Climate Change Convention, which has taken \r\nrather long to establish, is made operational. \r\n While placing emphasis on adaptation, we also \r\npledge to reduce emissions from industrial and other \r\nsources. We call upon industrialized countries, which \r\nhave a history of producing these emissions, to take \r\nserious steps to reduce them. We believe that the \r\nsituation is now serious and that narrow national \r\ninterests in this matter must be discarded forthwith. \r\n As a developing country, Zambia needs assistance \r\nto enhance its capacity in key adaptive areas, such as \r\nscientific research, early warning and rapid response, \r\nto address the adverse effects of climate change. \r\nAccordingly, Zambia calls for the speedy development \r\nand transfer of appropriate technologies to help us cope \r\nwith the negative impacts of climate change, as well as \r\nto put us on a low-carbon path to economic growth. We \r\nalso call for a more comprehensive institutional \r\nframework for international environmental governance. \r\n In 2000, the developing world embraced the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a \r\ncomprehensive strategy to move our countries out of \r\neconomic and social decline and better integrate us into \r\nthe global economy. Halfway through the \r\nimplementation period, many countries are far from \r\nattaining most of the Goals. That is so in spite of the \r\nimproved economic performance recorded by some \r\ndeveloping countries following recent debt relief \r\ninitiatives, coupled with sustained prudent economic \r\nmanagement. \r\n To illustrate the point, in Zambia the economy \r\ngrew by 6.2 per cent last year, and inflation declined to \r\na single digit level for the first time in 30 years. Those \r\neconomic gains, however, have not translated into a \r\nsignificant decline in the incidence of poverty, which \r\nstands at 68 per cent. Zambia’s development efforts are \r\nfurther compromised by the HIV/AIDS pandemic and, \r\nnow, the adverse effects of climate change. \r\n With regard to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, my \r\nGovernment has declared it to be a national crisis, \r\nrequiring sustained mitigation and preventive \r\nmeasures. I would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nall our cooperating partners for their support to Zambia \r\nin the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria. \r\n Despite these challenges, Zambia, for its part, has \r\nmade steady progress and is likely to meet most of the \r\nMDGs by 2015. The Goals most likely not to be \r\nattained by 2015 are: reducing by three quarters the \r\nmaternal mortality ratio, integrating the principles of \r\nsustainable development into the country’s policies and \r\nprogrammes and reversing the loss of environmental \r\nresources. Our goal now is to translate the economic \r\nachievements into tangible improvements in the quality \r\nof life of the Zambian people. That goal is enshrined in \r\nZambia’s Vision 2030, which is aimed at raising the \r\ncountry to middle-income status, significantly reducing \r\nhunger and poverty and fostering a competitive and \r\noutward-oriented economy. \r\n But that goal will remain elusive if our \r\ncooperating partners do not fulfil their commitments. \r\nIndeed, it is saddening to note that total official \r\ndevelopment assistance declined in real terms by 5.1 \r\nper cent between 2005 and 2006, and only five donor \r\ncountries have met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent target. \r\nI urge the cooperating partners to fulfil their \r\ncommitments. Furthermore, while Zambia welcomes \r\nthe discussions and progress made on aid effectiveness \r\nfollowing the Paris Declaration, we call for official \r\ndevelopment assistance to be delivered in a more \r\nefficient manner, in accordance with the Declaration. \r\n Aid cannot be effective unless corruption is \r\nuprooted. My Government has, therefore, declared war \r\nagainst that social vice. Accordingly, I take this \r\nopportunity to urge the international community to \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n17 07-51705 \r\n \r\ndesist from providing safe havens for leaders who \r\nplunder national resources. Such ill-gotten wealth \r\nshould be returned to the countries from where it was \r\nmisappropriated so that it can be used to fight poverty. \r\n Zambia condemns international terrorism in all \r\nits forms and manifestations. For this reason, we call \r\nupon members of the international community to \r\nrefrain from harbouring terrorists. Zambia, for its part, \r\nsupports the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \r\nTerrorism. \r\n Through regional bodies, such as the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), developing \r\ncountries enhance their ability to cooperate and also \r\njointly negotiate for better access to developed \r\ncountries’ markets. Consequently, during Zambia’s \r\ncurrent chairmanship of SADC, we shall continue to \r\nconsolidate the formation of the SADC free trade area \r\nby 2008 as a prerequisite to the Regional Customs \r\nUnion. In addition, Zambia will, on behalf of SADC, \r\nseek funding to develop an adequate regional \r\ntransboundary infrastructure in support of  \r\nmuch-needed connectivity in areas such as water, \r\ntransport, energy, communications and information \r\ntechnology. \r\n Many regions, including Africa, have been \r\ndogged by conflict. This has adversely affected the \r\ncountries’ potential to participate in the global \r\neconomic arena. In the quest for peace in our \r\nsubregion, SADC has launched a stand-by brigade, \r\nwhich will have the capacity for peace support \r\noperations. It is our hope that the international \r\ncommunity will render necessary support to the \r\nbrigade to enable it to fulfil its mandate. \r\n Better still, SADC and Zambia value the tenets of \r\ndemocracy, political stability and integrated economic \r\ndevelopment as the ultimate sound basis for peace and \r\nstability. SADC will, therefore, continue to promote \r\nthe conducting of free and fair elections in the region. \r\n Mr. Berdymukhammedov (Turkmenistan), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm, with regard to \r\nthe theme of this session, Zambia’s commitment to \r\ncooperate with the international community in \r\naddressing the problem of climate change. It is my \r\nsincere hope that all of us will play our full part, \r\naccording to our abilities to deal with this serious \r\nglobal challenge. To that end, we should not remain \r\nindecisive and indifferent to this serious issue. Neither \r\nshould we miss the opportunity to do what we can to \r\nmake the world a better place to live in. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident and Minister of Defence for the Republic of \r\nZambia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Elias Antonio Saca Gonzalez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): The \r\nAssembly will hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador. \r\nMr. Antonio Saca Gonzalez, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Elias Antonio Saca Gonzalez, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, and invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Saca Gonzalez (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the people and Government of El Salvador, I \r\nwould like to extend the most sincere congratulations \r\nto Mr. Kerim on his being unanimously elected to \r\npreside over this session and to wish him every success \r\nin fulfilling his mandate. At the same time, I would like \r\nto express our appreciation of the dynamic work done \r\nby the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral and call on them to continue to make every \r\neffort to strengthen the United Nations. \r\n Allow me to express once more our gratitude for \r\nthe important role played by the Organization, in \r\nparticular its contribution to conflict resolution and to \r\neconomic and social development, as so successfully \r\nexemplified in the peace process in Central America, \r\nbased on the 1987 Esquipulas II Agreement. Recently, \r\nCentral American countries celebrated the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the signing of that Agreement which set \r\nin motion the process of establishing a firm and lasting \r\npeace in Central America with a view to achieving, \r\nthrough dialogue, a peaceful solution to the Central \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 18 \r\n \r\nAmerican crisis and promoting peacebuilding and \r\ndemocratization in the region.  \r\n Following a long process of transition from war \r\nto peace, from peace to democracy and to freedom, we \r\nare now focusing our efforts on the implementation of \r\nan economic and social development model that is just \r\nand equitable. In particular, we are promoting an \r\nintegration process that will allow us to strengthen our \r\ncapabilities and combine resources to more efficiently \r\ntackle and thus benefit from the process of opening up \r\nto world trade. \r\n In this context, I would like to mention, in \r\nparticular, a regional issue that has attracted the \r\nattention of the international community and that was \r\nreferred to yesterday in the media, namely, the Gulf of \r\nFonseca. As President of El Salvador, I wish to inform \r\nyou that I have submitted a formal initiative to the \r\nbrother States of Honduras and Nicaragua in order to \r\ndevelop a frank and sincere dialogue with a view to \r\nushering in a new era of cooperation in this area in \r\norder to truly establish a joint ownership regime and \r\nthereby facilitate the overall and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the Gulf Zone for all its inhabitants. \r\nThat proposal, made yesterday, was well received by \r\nthe leaders of Honduras and Nicaragua. The three \r\nStates should begin a new era of collaboration and \r\ncooperation in order to tackle and fully resolve issues \r\nrelated to the Gulf. We should not leave any problem in \r\nthe Gulf of Fonseca unresolved, whether it be by a \r\nthree-nation or a two-nation approach. \r\n A topic of special interest for my country is \r\ninternational migration, in view of its positive impact \r\non countries of origin and destination alike, and, in \r\nparticular, because of the significant contributions \r\nimmigrants make to the economy. Our Government is \r\nmaking efforts for Salvadorians who have emigrated, \r\nsupporting them through our Embassies and \r\nConsulates. In this respect, we greatly appreciate the \r\nagreements and recommendations emanating from the \r\nUnited Nations High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development, which reiterated the \r\nnecessity of fully respecting the human rights of \r\nmigrants and their families, who must be a central \r\nconcern of internal and external immigration policy of \r\nStates, including transit States.  \r\n I am pleased to confirm that the efforts I have \r\nmade in favour of Salvadorian immigrants, especially \r\nin the United States, have yielded positive results such \r\nas the extension of the Temporary Protected States \r\n(TPS) programme, which guarantees work permits and \r\nthe opportunity to reside in that country with no risk of \r\nbeing deported. Those efforts demonstrate my firm will \r\nto continue spearheading initiatives and efforts in order \r\nto stabilize migration for all of our fellow citizens. \r\n In the Central American region, we have made \r\nsignificant progress in different areas, but \r\nunfortunately, long-standing and emerging threats \r\ncould still affect the security of our citizens and the \r\nstability of our countries. It is therefore essential to \r\nunite our efforts to frame suitable national, regional \r\nand international policies.  \r\n Currently, in most of our countries, as well as in \r\nthe United States and Mexico, citizens are noting that \r\none of the greatest threats to democracy and economic \r\nand social development springs from the activities of \r\ngangs, generating a wave of violence and crime in an \r\nopen challenge to the established order. Those anti-\r\nsocial groups do not conform to the patterns of \r\ntraditional or ordinary crime, but gradually evolve into \r\nmore sophisticated forms of organized crime whose \r\nmanifestations can also be seen in countries outside the \r\ncontinent. Many countries represented here are not as \r\nyet faced with this threat. However, the criminal \r\nactivities of such groups are expanding, both \r\nsubstantively and quantitatively, as is actually apparent \r\nand thus the treatment of this issue requires action and \r\ncooperation of all States, especially in Latin America. \r\nAs for El Salvador, we are making efforts that have led \r\nto the reduction of crime and homicide perpetuated by \r\nsuch groups through joint actions involving our public \r\nsecurity authorities, the judicial system and the \r\nlegislative authority. At the same time, we are \r\ncoordinating efforts and adopting measures within the \r\nframework of security policies for Central America. \r\n We have to strengthen global cooperation in the \r\nfight against terrorism, which is one of the greatest \r\nthreats to peace and international security. The recent \r\nthwarted terrorist attacks in European countries and the \r\nrepeated threats by extremist groups to continue with \r\ntheir terrorist actions in different parts of the world are \r\na grave threat and danger looming over our society. \r\nConsequently, we welcome the efforts of Member \r\nStates of the United Nations to adopt a global counter-\r\nterrorism strategy, giving particular importance to \r\npreventing and combating terrorism on a unified, \r\ncoherent and coordinated basis. \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n19 07-51705 \r\n \r\n The Middle East is a region in which nations \r\nhave developed different missions and supported \r\ninitiatives for a just and lasting solution to the problem, \r\nwhile the United Nations itself has made undoubted \r\nefforts to that end, which, unfortunately, have not been \r\nsuccessful. \r\n We support any initiative or effort to redirect the \r\npeace process. In particular, we welcome the initiative \r\nto convene an international peace conference for the \r\nMiddle East in November. That initiative is a source of \r\nrenewed hope for achieving the long-awaited peace \r\nthat will allow all peoples of the region to live free \r\nfrom fear, violence and destruction. It would also \r\nestablish an environment conducive to political \r\ncooperation and to shared economic and social \r\ndevelopment. We recognize the Palestinian people’s \r\nright to self-determination, as well as Israel’s right to \r\nlive within secure and internationally recognized \r\nborders, so that both peoples can live in peace. \r\n Taiwan is a unique political reality in the \r\ninternational community. It has systematically \r\ndeveloped, in particular in recent years, under the \r\nleadership of President Chen Shui-bian. He has made \r\nhis country a modern, peaceful entity that is resolutely \r\ndetermined to promote peace and international \r\ncooperation. Given that reality, we acknowledge the \r\nlegitimate right of more than 23 million Taiwanese to \r\ndetermine their own future, just as other peoples have \r\ndone. That is why we support the initiative to have the \r\nGeneral Assembly review the case of Taiwan in the \r\nlight of current global realities, acknowledging the \r\nright of the Taiwanese to hold a referendum on joining \r\nthis international Organization. \r\n El Salvador will continue to play an active role in \r\nthe reform process of the United Nations, which, we \r\nreiterate, should be comprehensive. In that regard, \r\nsince States are responsible for complying with the \r\nobjectives of the Charter, we must strive not only to \r\nachieve consensus and move towards Security Council \r\nreform, but also to revitalize the General Assembly and \r\nthoroughly revise the mandate of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. \r\n The current economic situation has improved for \r\nsome developing countries that have achieved \r\nacceptable rates of growth. However, international \r\ninstability in prices, commodities and raw materials — \r\nin particular the high prices for petroleum — is having \r\na negative impact on our development efforts. Indeed, \r\nglobal economic short- and mid-term imbalances must \r\nbe anticipated and prevented, and require the \r\ncoordination of international macroeconomic policy \r\ninvolving developed and underdeveloped countries. \r\n In an effort to review the criteria and conditions \r\nfor the extension of international cooperation, the first \r\nIntergovernmental Conference on Middle-Income \r\nCountries took place in Madrid on 1 and 2 March. At \r\nthe Conference, we identified several areas for \r\nstrategic action that could guide the efforts of \r\ninternational donors to contribute to the development \r\nof that group of countries. We thank the Government of \r\nSpain for its readiness to host the event and for the \r\nmeeting’s success. We also express our gratitude to \r\nKing Abdullah II of Jordan and his Government for \r\nconvening the summit of the Group of Eleven in May, \r\nand in particular for the recommendation that resulted \r\nfrom that forum. \r\n Next October, my country, El Salvador, will host \r\nthe second International Conference on Development \r\nCooperation with Middle-Income Countries in order to \r\nfurther study international measures allowing us to \r\nmeet the Millennium Development Goals. We believe \r\nthat donor countries and international financial \r\norganizations should reassess their development \r\ncooperation policies with the principal aim of \r\nencouraging those countries which are responsibly \r\nimplementing transparent growth strategies that are \r\nadequately endowed in terms of finance management \r\nand of the quality and impact of projects. To the \r\nmiddle-income countries and the entire cooperating \r\ncommunity, including international financial \r\norganizations, I reiterate here our cordial invitation to \r\njoin us in the important event to take place in San \r\nSalvador in October. \r\n With respect to development, I would stress that, \r\nin the past 10 years, my country has reduced the level \r\nof overall poverty from 65 per cent to 30 per cent. One \r\nof my Government’s priorities is and will continue to \r\nbe fighting extreme poverty, towards which we are \r\nimplementing a series of substantive social \r\nprogrammes. One of the most important of those is the \r\nSolidarity Network, through which we directly support \r\nfamilies living in extreme poverty, mainly in the rural \r\nareas, by granting health and education subsidies and \r\nby providing infrastructure, basic services and \r\nopportunities to enter the labour market through, inter \r\nalia, the provision of microcredit. We have also \r\nestablished a special health fund through which we \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 20 \r\n \r\nhave increased basic health care for the most \r\nvulnerable sectors of the population, seeking to benefit \r\nmore than 4 million people through comprehensive \r\nprogrammes to include prevention and the promotion \r\nof health education campaigns. \r\n While we acknowledge that progress has been \r\nachieved and efforts made to improve the living \r\nstandards of the most vulnerable sectors of the country, \r\nwe must continue to enjoy international bilateral and \r\nmultilateral cooperation if we are to achieve higher \r\nlevels of well-being. Our Government is convinced that \r\nthe social sphere is not complementary to anything \r\nelse, but the basis of everything. \r\n One of the most disturbing challenges to the \r\npresent and future of the international community is \r\nglobal warming. In particular, as we learn in the \r\nimpressive report prepared by the United Nations \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the \r\nharmful effects of climate change on all peoples have \r\ngrown alarming in their human, material, economic and \r\nenvironmental impacts, which are increasingly being \r\nfelt in countries and regions throughout the world. All \r\nStates must speedily and fully adopt corrective \r\nmeasures in order substantially to reduce greenhouse \r\ngas emissions so as to halt the trend towards \r\nirreversible and massive environmental degradation. To \r\nthat end, we urge developed countries to join in the \r\nefforts to curb that trend with responsibility and in a \r\ncommon but differentiated manner. \r\n Alongside international efforts for environmental \r\nprotection, the countries of Latin America, including \r\nthose of Central America, Mexico and Colombia, \r\nmembers of the Puebla-Panama Plan, are undertaking \r\nmeasures and coordinating regional and subregional \r\nactivities in the field of renewable and sustainable \r\nenergy as alternatives to fossil fuels. Concerned by the \r\ninstability of international hydrocarbon fuel prices, at \r\nthe previous session of the General Assembly we \r\nproposed that the topic be included on the agenda \r\nbecause of its impact on economic development, in \r\nparticular in developing countries. In the current \r\nsituation of ever-spiralling high prices, we reiterate \r\nthat proposal. We have been increasingly diverting \r\nprecious economic resources that could, in other \r\ncircumstances, be directed towards other programmes \r\nessential to our countries’ human development.  \r\n That is why, at this global forum, we appeal to \r\nthe oil-producing countries to seek, on the basis of \r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity, to implement \r\nflexible mechanisms to prevent hydrocarbon fuel prices \r\nfrom drastically impacting developing countries. We in \r\nthe United Nations cannot ignore that issue, because \r\ncountries that depend on oil could be bankrupted in the \r\ncoming years. \r\n I must mention that, faced with high oil prices, \r\nwe are promoting several initiatives in El Salvador in \r\nthe area of alternative and renewable energy, such as \r\nbiofuels. One of those initiatives has led to the \r\nformulation of a bill on incentives for investing in \r\nrenewable energy. We also analysed the economic and \r\ntechnical feasibility of introducing a plan to produce \r\nethanol on a national scale. That is in addition to \r\nstepping up thermal energy, which in El Salvador \r\nalready represents 23 per cent of energy consumption \r\nwith the entry into operation of the new plant in the \r\neastern part of El Salvador. Similarly, we are beginning \r\ntechnical and financial feasibility studies to promote \r\nthe production of biodiesel through the establishment \r\nof a pilot plant and the use of different crops, which \r\nwill make it possible to promote reforestation and to \r\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, relying for this on \r\nthe direct support of the United States, Brazil and \r\nColombia.  \r\n We believe that Latin American and other \r\ndeveloping countries could contribute substantively to \r\nglobal environmental conservation efforts. But efforts \r\nwill be limited if industrialized countries do not fully \r\nassume their responsibilities when it comes to the \r\nenvironment. \r\n Lastly, I would like to recall that we are all \r\nrepresentatives of our respective countries and they are \r\nthe ones that we must serve and protect from the \r\nthreats that we face. We are convinced that the future \r\nof humanity will depend on the decisions and actions \r\nthat we will adopt here and that we will implement in \r\nareas of common global interest. We have the \r\nresponsibility and obligation to act, and this we must \r\ndo in order to avert a problem of uncontrollable \r\nproportions.  \r\n We must understand that the future of humanity \r\nwill depend on the decisions and actions that we adopt \r\ntoday, but I would like to strongly emphasize that \r\npeople reach development as a result of perseverance, \r\norder, work, discipline and long-term vision. The \r\ntransformation process and the progress that has been \r\nachieved in economic and social policy in the \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n21 07-51705 \r\n \r\ndemocratic institutions of my country are the result of \r\nthe exercise of freedoms. Progress is built and gains \r\nmomentum when people work hard, persevere and \r\nhave full freedom, which makes it possible to move \r\ntowards the implementation of the greatest dream that \r\npeople have: to enjoy progress and social peace.  \r\n I invite the Assembly to combine their efforts to \r\nconsolidate freedoms in those countries that already \r\nenjoy them and to return freedoms to countries that do \r\nnot have them or have lost them. Let us remember that \r\nthe dearest freedom is the one that we do not have, that \r\nliberty is not missed until we lose it. Without freedom, \r\nthere is no economic and social progress. We must \r\nwork every day for freedoms that are threatened by \r\nextreme radicalism or populist demagoguery, the seeds \r\nthat destroy freedom. God bless the world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Elías Antonio Saca González, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nMs. Bethel (Bahamas), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Festus G. Mogae, President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nBotswana. \r\nMr. Festus G. Mogae, President of the Republic of \r\nBotswana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome Mr. Festus G. \r\nMogae, President of the Republic of Botswana, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mogae: Many speakers before me \r\nhave eloquently debated the theme for this session. I \r\nam delighted that no one disputes the evidence that \r\nscience presents to us concerning climate change. \r\nToday we meet in this Hall as neighbours and residents \r\nof this one planet earth. We are bound together by our \r\ncommon humanity and shared future. We have within \r\nus the capacity to act resolutely to save our planet, and \r\nnow is the time. We cannot afford to squander any \r\nmore opportunities, for tomorrow might be too late. \r\n William Shakespeare instructs us, in his famous \r\nwork, Julius Caesar, that: \r\n“There is a tide in the affairs of men, \r\nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; \r\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life  \r\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.  \r\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat;  \r\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,  \r\nOr lose our ventures.” \r\n We are convinced that we should focus on \r\nworking together to save our planet from the increasing \r\nthreat of global warming and all its attendant \r\nconsequences. When we meet as the peoples of the \r\nworld, we must of necessity remind ourselves of the \r\noriginal and higher purpose of the United Nations. \r\nMany of the global challenges we face persist, not \r\nbecause they are insurmountable, but because we have \r\nfallen short of the commitments and obligations freely \r\nentered into under the Charter. \r\n We, the peoples of the earth, have the human and \r\ncultural resources and technology to end severe global \r\npoverty and disease, reverse climate change, prevent \r\nwars and alleviate human suffering. Unfortunately, \r\nsubstantial resources continue to be wasted on \r\ndestructive endeavours rather than constructive work. \r\nWe squander valuable assets in the production of \r\nweapons of war and mass destruction rather than \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The world would be a much better place if the \r\nnatural resources on this planet were exploited to feed, \r\nclothe, educate, care for the sick, prevent diseases and \r\nbuild communities. Young men and women should \r\ngrow up looking forward to doing extraordinary things \r\nto advance the cause of economic and social progress \r\nand not spending precious time manufacturing bombs \r\nand weapons of war or planning how to kill other \r\nhuman beings. \r\n It is deeply regrettable that nations continue to \r\ngive higher priority to the narrow pursuit of national \r\ninterests than to cooperation for the common good and \r\nmutual benefit. This emphasis on rivalry breeds \r\ninjustice, intolerance, extremism and aggression. We \r\nmust remind ourselves that all of us are the people of \r\nthis earth and no other. We are bound by our common \r\nhumanity. We must rise to the challenge of the \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 22 \r\n \r\nfounders of this unique universal Organization, so that \r\nwe may live for our respective countries rather than die \r\nfor them and together build a more just and equitable \r\nfuture for us all. \r\n The United Nations has touched the lives of the \r\nvast majority of our fellow human beings. We therefore \r\nreaffirm our abiding faith in its efficacy and usefulness \r\nin addressing global issues. The Organization embodies \r\nour hope and aspirations for peace, security, respect for \r\nhuman rights and development; in one word, a better \r\nlife for all. In that respect, the search for consensus in \r\nall aspects of United Nations reform must of necessity \r\ncontinue in a fair, just and balanced manner. \r\n From 51 Member States in 1945 to 192 in 2007, \r\nthe United Nations has grown in diversity and \r\nuniversality. It has also spread and consolidated its \r\nlegitimacy and authority throughout the world. The \r\nUnited Nations is the centre for harmonizing the \r\nactions of nations towards the attainment of the \r\ncommon good. Its strength lies in its unparalleled \r\nlegitimacy. Without the United Nations, States, both \r\nlarge and small, would encounter many formidable \r\nchallenges. \r\n It is hardly surprising, therefore, that for this \r\nOrganization to live up to its mandate and to people’s \r\nexpectations, it has to constantly reform itself to \r\nrespond to contemporary global challenges and \r\nrealities. In his inspiring and visionary statement at the \r\nclosing of the San Francisco Conference 62 years ago, \r\nPresident Harry Truman of the United States proffered \r\ntimeless wise counsel when he said, \r\n“This Charter, like our own Constitution, will be \r\nexpanded and improved as time goes on. No one \r\nclaims that it is now a final or a perfect \r\ninstrument. It has not been poured into a fixed \r\nmold. Changing world conditions will require \r\nreadjustments — but they will be the \r\nreadjustments of peace and not of war.” (United \r\nNations Conference on International \r\nOrganization, Documents, Vol. I, 680 (26 June \r\n1945)) \r\nThose visionary words of one of the founding fathers \r\nof the United Nations should guide us in dealing with \r\nUnited Nations reform. We call upon the original \r\nsignatories of the United Nations Charter and, in \r\nparticular the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, to assume greater leadership in the search for \r\nconsensus and compromise on the reform of the United \r\nNations Security Council. They should be more \r\nflexible in responding to proposals put forward on the \r\nreforms of the Security Council. \r\n As nation States we are encouraged to build \r\nsound democratic institutions. It is imperative, \r\ntherefore, that the principle of fairer, more inclusive, \r\nparticipatory and accountable institutions should be \r\nextended to global governance. In that respect, it \r\nshould be perfectly understandable why a substantial \r\nnumber of Member States consider it not only \r\nnecessary, but also long overdue, to increase \r\nmembership of the Council in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. Today, important matters of \r\ninternational peace and security cannot be resolved \r\nthrough the monopoly of fire power. It requires greater \r\nparticipation and collaboration of nations — large and \r\nsmall. \r\n Botswana recognizes that we cannot all be \r\nmembers of the Security Council. There are those \r\namong us who have the capacity to carry the daunting \r\nresponsibilities of permanent membership. That is why \r\nit should be possible for us to reach consensus in \r\nmaking “readjustments of peace and not of war”. An \r\nall-or-nothing approach is not in our best interest. \r\nBotswana strongly supports the search for a \r\ncompromise on that long-standing issue, which if left \r\nunresolved can only become an unnecessary distraction \r\nto other equally pressing priorities. \r\n Conflicts in Africa cause the loss of hundreds of \r\nthousands of innocent lives. Many people are driven \r\ninto abject poverty and exposed to disease due to the \r\nmassive displacement of populations and destruction of \r\ntheir productive capacity. Huge amounts of resources \r\nare annually allocated to the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping budget to resolve conflicts. Even more \r\nresources are needed for the care and upkeep of \r\nrefugees and displaced peoples. \r\n The situation in Darfur continues to cause \r\nconcern. Concerted efforts are needed to bring that \r\nconflict to an end. In this respect, we welcome the \r\nSecurity Council decision to deploy a peacekeeping \r\nmission in Darfur and call upon our brothers and sisters \r\nin the Sudan to work together to find a lasting political \r\nsettlement. \r\n Botswana is concerned about the situation in \r\nChad and the Central African Republic. The loss of \r\ncivilian lives is intolerable. We call upon Chad, the \r\nCentral African Republic and other parties to those \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n23 07-51705 \r\n \r\nconflicts to commit to a peaceful political process to \r\navert further loss of lives. It is clear that the resolution \r\nof conflict in that region will require closer \r\ncooperation, collaboration and partnership between and \r\namong those countries involved in conflict situations. \r\n Following elections in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo we are hopeful the country is on the road \r\nto recovery. It is important for the international \r\ncommunity to continue to support the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo in its post-conflict \r\nreconstruction and development efforts. The marauding \r\nlawless militias that continue to undermine the peace \r\nprocess should be left in no doubt that anarchy will not \r\nbe tolerated. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the \r\ncountries of the Great Lakes region of Africa will for \r\nthe foreseeable future require the assured support and \r\npartnership of the international community, not only in \r\npeacebuilding but more importantly, in the prevention \r\nof conflicts. \r\n Botswana acknowledges the existence of those \r\nproblems, not because we consider the future of Africa \r\nto be hopeless or bleak. We do so in order to arrive at a \r\ncorrect diagnosis of the illnesses and hence the \r\nprescription of the right remedy. \r\n The African Union is playing a pivotal role in the \r\nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts on \r\nthe continent. While the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil has the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, Africa \r\nshould be a dependable and indispensable partner in \r\nresponding expeditiously to the urgent need to end the \r\nconflicts and save lives. \r\n The countries and peoples of Africa should \r\nrecognize that the primary responsibility for durable \r\npeace and social and economic development lies with \r\nthem. In that respect, we should adopt sound policies \r\nand programmes that promote economic growth and \r\ndevelopment, foreign direct investment as well as \r\ndomestic investment. \r\n Indeed we are witnessing significant economic \r\ngrowth in Africa. The latest International Monetary \r\nFund projections are that, in 2007 the African economy \r\nis expected to grow by six per cent, just below the \r\nseven per cent per annum target of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development, that is necessary to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n We look to our development partners to deliver \r\non the pledges to scale up official development \r\nassistance to Africa, effect meaningful debt relief, \r\nimprove market access for African goods and services \r\nand encourage their private sectors to invest in Africa. \r\n In the year 2000, at the dawn of the new \r\nmillennium, we convened in these hallowed halls to \r\nchart a new path for the United Nations development \r\nagenda. We adopted the Millennium Declaration and \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We undertook to \r\neradicate extreme poverty and hunger, promote gender \r\nequality as well as to combat HIV and AIDS. \r\n The Millennium Summit followed many global \r\nconferences of the 1990s at which we made numerous \r\ncommitments to combat poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. The outcomes of these United \r\nNations conferences and summits provide a veritable \r\ntemplate for addressing the debilitating scourge of \r\npoverty, disease, hunger and underdevelopment in the \r\nworld. \r\n Today, as we meet here seven years after the \r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration and half way \r\nto 2015, we should pause and take serious stock of the \r\nprogress made or the lack of it. It is evident that, while \r\nother regions of the world are making progress towards \r\nthe realization of the MDGs, indications are that unless \r\nsomething is done to support Africa, the continent is \r\nunlikely to achieve any of the Goals by 2015. Statistics \r\ntell tales of a continent that is host to huge numbers of \r\nthe poor and the hungry. Diseases, in particular \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, still kill many \r\npeople in Africa. Those factors require an urgent \r\nresponse, as they create conditions that pose a threat to \r\npeace, stability and security. \r\n In this interdependent world, the United Nations \r\ncannot realistically hope to achieve the MDGs by 2015 \r\nif one part of humanity is lagging so far behind. \r\nSomething must be done to assist and support Africa. \r\nIn March 2002 at Monterrey, Mexico, we recognized \r\nthe imperative of global cooperation and partnership in \r\nthe achievement of internationally agreed development \r\ngoals. We agreed that \r\n“achieving the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including those contained in the United \r\nNations Millennium Declaration, demands a new \r\npartnership between developed and developing \r\ncountries” (resolution 58/130, para. 11). \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 24 \r\n \r\nLet us honour our commitments and move forward. \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating the fact that \r\nBotswana has long recognized that sustainable \r\ndevelopment has to be a nationally owned and led \r\nprocess that requires sound democratic institutions and \r\nprudent economic management. Adherence to those \r\nprinciples, coupled with the exploitation of mineral \r\nresources and donor support, enabled us to achieve \r\nrapid economic growth and some measure of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Continued assistance is necessary to enable us to \r\nconsolidate the gains of the past few years and ensure \r\nsustainable development. In that respect, the scope of \r\ndevelopment cooperation should include private sector \r\ndevelopment, private investment and access to \r\ntechnology. Assistance to middle-income countries \r\nsuch as Botswana is crucial and in the long-term \r\ninterest of the global economy. We are asking not for \r\nhandouts, but for assured support, partnership and \r\ncollaboration. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Botswana for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Festus Mogae, President of the Republic of \r\nBotswana, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. René Garcia Préval, President of \r\nthe Republic of Haiti \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti. \r\n  Mr. René Garcia Préval, President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. René Garcia Préval, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Préval (spoke in French): Allow me at \r\nthe outset to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. There is no doubt that his deep \r\nfamiliarity with the academic world, tied to his \r\nexperience in the political world and in business, is a \r\nmajor asset that will help him to lead us confidently in \r\nthe Assembly’s work. I sincerely hope that our debates \r\nwill be fruitful and lead to the adoption of relevant \r\nresolutions. \r\n Allow me also to welcome our new Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who recently honoured us \r\nwith his first visit to Haiti in August. We are firmly \r\nconvinced that the new Secretary-General will rapidly \r\nbring to bear his experience of the United Nations \r\nsystem, his vast learning and his broad open-\r\nmindedness in carrying out the reforms that most \r\nMembers of our Organization know to be necessary. \r\n Despite its difficulties, our Organization remains \r\nthe principal forum offering all States, large and small, \r\nthe same space for dialogue to address the fundamental \r\nissues surrounding our coexistence and future on this \r\nplanet. May the Secretary-General be assured of the \r\nsupport of the Haitians in his efforts to increase the \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations and to enable it to \r\nachieve its full potential. \r\n I am speaking here on behalf of a people that has \r\nendured great suffering over the past 200 years: \r\nmaterial deprivation of all sorts, vulnerability to \r\nnatural threats and disasters, poor access to health care \r\nand education, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of \r\nchildren from malnutrition, and a very young \r\npopulation — 65 per cent below the age of 25 — \r\ndenied any true opportunity for employment. \r\n I speak on behalf of a people that seems to be \r\ndepopulating itself as its most competent professionals \r\nforsake a life of difficulties to the benefit of other \r\ncountries or businesses, and as its children, women and \r\nsenior citizens, weary of living what seems to be a \r\nhopeless existence, take to the open seas on makeshift \r\nboats, seeking a better life under other skies. \r\n I speak on behalf of a State whose neighbours, \r\nincluding the most powerful among them, sometimes \r\nportray it as a threat to regional security because Haiti \r\nappears too frequently on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly or the Security Council, with a burdensome \r\narray of problems of insecurity or political unrest. \r\n I speak on behalf of a country that analyses \r\nsomewhat prematurely describe as a failed State \r\nbecause it has trouble making its institutions \r\noperational and organizing a way of life appropriate to \r\nthe majority of its citizens, and because the State itself, \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n25 07-51705 \r\n \r\nunfortunately, often finds itself waging an endless war \r\nagainst its own children. \r\n Haiti is on the way to bidding farewell to that \r\nState — slowly, patiently, yet resolutely. The organized \r\narmed gangs responsible for violence against innocent \r\npeople have been dismantled and there is no longer any \r\nforbidden zone for peaceful citizens anywhere on our \r\nterritory. \r\n The management of our economy has improved \r\nconsiderably. We have stopped printing money. That \r\nhas reduced the inflation rate — which had run \r\nrampant for several years and which just a few months \r\nago reached 40 per cent — to less than 10 per cent. Our \r\ngross domestic product has seen moderate but \r\nsustained growth, after having been negative for more \r\nthan 10 years.  \r\n We have worked patiently to establish an \r\natmosphere of calm and collegiality within the political \r\nclass, which is a condition essential for enabling the \r\npolitical forces to put an end to their perpetual \r\nfactional disputes and to mobilize around genuine \r\nnational reconstruction plans.  \r\n The Security Council will soon extend the \r\nmandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \r\nHaiti (MINUSTAH) for another year. Such an \r\nextension would be most appropriate. This reminds us \r\nthat our victory over insecurity, the holding of \r\ndemocratic elections, the improvement of governance \r\nin the country and the strengthening of our judicial \r\nsystem were possible thanks in large part to the efforts \r\nof United Nations forces within the framework of the \r\nOrganization’s peacekeeping programme. Certainly, the \r\nmembers of our national police, although young, \r\ninexperienced and underequipped, have proved to be \r\ncourageous and determined in the fight against \r\ninsecurity, but MINUSTAH’s support at their side has \r\nbeen greatly appreciated. Let me take this opportunity \r\nto express once again our thanks to the Organization, \r\nto the Security Council and to the friendly countries \r\nthat mobilized their own resources and citizens to \r\ncome to the assistance of Haitians at this difficult time \r\nin their history. \r\n Haitians, recalling that they belong to a people \r\nwho fought for their freedom and carried the torch of \r\nliberty to many other shores of the continent, continue \r\nto see the presence of foreign armed forces on their soil \r\nas a wound to their national sovereignty. Practically \r\nspeaking, however, that is the only realistic formula \r\ncurrently available that is enabling Haitians to regain \r\nfreedom and live in peace. \r\n It is now up to Haitians to benefit from this \r\nperiod of calm by pulling themselves together, \r\nreconsidering their fate with a positive vision of the \r\nfuture and returning to daily life as a disciplined, \r\nhardworking and law-abiding people while our State \r\nstrengthens its internal cohesion, modernizes its \r\njudicial system and improves its governance and its \r\ncapacity to intervene, so that it can create and maintain \r\nan environment conducive to economic recovery and \r\ngenuine sustainable development. \r\n The adoption of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) was an act of awareness. Nevertheless, \r\nhalfway towards the deadline set for achievement of \r\nthe Goals, it seems clear that many of us — including \r\nmy country — will not meet the 2015 targets, despite \r\nthe considerable progress made in various areas. \r\nMobilizing resources to support the pursuit of the \r\nMDGs is a difficult but essential task. It is not only \r\nnecessary for ethical reasons or because the \r\ninternational community must honour its commitments. \r\nProblems that cannot be resolved in a poor State will \r\nspill over to richer States, which will thus be forced to \r\nrevisit problems that they had already overcome by \r\nthemselves at the national level. \r\n The General Assembly has included in the agenda \r\nfor the present session an item relating to cooperation \r\nin combating the activities of transnational organized \r\ncrime. In that connection, I should like to highlight my \r\ncountry’s efforts to fight against corruption and illicit \r\ndrug trafficking. In Haiti, we are currently developing \r\nways to deal with corruption. We have begun to work \r\nto strengthen State structures and to plan legal and \r\nregulatory reforms to be established to ensure that that \r\nendemic evil disappears from our institutional \r\npractices, both in politics and in business.  \r\n But the fight against drug trafficking is of another \r\nscale entirely, because it sets us squarely against \r\nsophisticated and well-organized adversaries who have \r\naccess to powerful international networks in both drug-\r\nproducing and drug-consuming countries. We are \r\nsensitive to the human suffering and social upheaval \r\nattributable to drug abuse, and we are aware of the \r\nefforts being made to treat and rehabilitate addicts, \r\nprimarily in the major drug-consuming countries. \r\nHowever, trafficking also has harmful effects on the \r\neconomic, social and political structures of small States \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 26 \r\n \r\nsuch as mine and poses a serious threat to their \r\nsovereignty and security, even if they are only transit \r\nStates. The approach that has emerged from various \r\ninternational conferences focuses on prevention and \r\ndemand-reduction in consumer countries first and then \r\nto reduce supply in producing countries and suppress \r\ntrafficking networks. \r\n Haiti and the Dominican Republic are on the \r\ntrade route of one of the most intense flows between \r\nthe producer countries of South America and the \r\nconsumer countries of North America. We are firmly \r\ncommitted to helping the countries of the North \r\neliminate the drugs that arrive in their countries by way \r\nof our territory as a place of transit. But we cannot deal \r\nwith this scourge alone, and our efforts to improve the \r\nmonitoring of our land, sea and air borders and \r\nstrengthen our institutions come up against the power \r\nof the networks put in place by the traffickers. \r\n The solutions developed to deal with these \r\nproblems will clearly yield no results if we do not \r\nurgently address the issue of economic development, \r\nbecause, as has been eloquently stated in reports of the \r\nSecretary-General, development is another name for \r\npeace. \r\n It follows from that observation that we need a \r\nnew culture of international solidarity based on a \r\ncomprehensive and coordinated approach in which the \r\nfight against poverty goes hand in hand with \r\nsustainable development. It is an approach in which \r\ndevelopment assistance and the fight against insecurity \r\nare supported by the efforts of more developed \r\ncountries to open up their markets, to encourage flows \r\nof foreign direct investment and technology transfers \r\nand to support the private sector and entrepreneurial \r\ninitiatives: a comprehensive approach in which rich \r\nand poor understand that they are co-owners of this \r\nplanet and that its fate is in all our hands. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. René Préval, President of the Republic of Haiti, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire.  \r\n Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the Republic of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President \r\nof the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Gbagbo (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nat the outset to congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, on the quality of the intensive work \r\ndone in such a short period of time at the head of the \r\nUnited Nations. I would like to congratulate him \r\nsincerely and to encourage him on his correct \r\nassessment of the world’s present problems. \r\n This is the first time that I am taking part in the \r\nGeneral Assembly in my seven years at the head of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire. As members know, I am fully committed \r\nto resolving the crisis gripping my country and which \r\nhas so mobilized the international community over the \r\npast five years. My presence, today, here in New York, \r\nat this rostrum, is the best proof of the climate of calm \r\nprevailing in Côte d’Ivoire today, following the signing \r\nof the Ouagadougou political agreement, which was \r\nthe outcome of direct dialogue between the State and \r\nthe former rebels. \r\n That agreement was endorsed by the Security \r\nCouncil which unanimously adopted resolution 1765 \r\n(2007). On behalf of the people of Côte d’Ivoire, I \r\nwish to thank and to greet all who were involved in \r\nthese positive developments: the countries members of \r\nthe Security Council, the countries members of the \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council, all the \r\ncountries of the African Union and the countries \r\nmembers of the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS). In particular, I thank the heads of \r\nState whose personal involvement was key in resolving \r\nthe crisis in Côte d’Ivoire: President Thabo Mbeki, \r\nmediator in the Ivorian crisis appointed by the African \r\nUnion, and President Blaise Compaoré, facilitator for \r\nthe direct inter-Ivorian dialogue, as current Chairman \r\nof ECOWAS. \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n27 07-51705 \r\n \r\n We have noted that despite the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts over the previous four years, the \r\npeace process was blocked and the country was at a \r\nstandstill. That is why, on 19 December 2006, I \r\nsuggested to my compatriots a way out of the crisis, \r\nfocusing on five points: first, the establishment of \r\ndirect dialogue with the rebels, aimed at disarmament \r\nand the reunification of the country; secondly, the \r\nremoval of the Zone of Confidence; thirdly, the \r\nestablishment of a national service programme; \r\nfourthly, a general amnesty; and finally, the \r\nestablishment of an assistance programme for the \r\nreturn of persons displaced by the war. That plan was \r\nbased on the experience of solutions considered up \r\nuntil then, but with a completely different approach, in \r\norder to ensure complete ownership of the peace \r\nprocess by the Ivorians themselves. \r\n I thus took up direct dialogue with the rebels. Our \r\ndiscussions, through the facilitation of President Blaise \r\nCompaoré, took place in neighbouring Burkina Faso, \r\nthe West African country with the closest historical and \r\nsociological ties with Côte d’Ivoire. Those discussions \r\nled to the signing on 4 March 2007 of the \r\nOuagadougou political agreement. \r\n In accordance with that agreement, a new \r\nGovernment was established. It is headed by the \r\nformer rebel leader, Mr. Guillaume Soro. With this \r\nGovernment, we have made considerable progress in a \r\nshort period of time. An integrated command centre, \r\nbringing together soldiers from the national armed \r\nforces and from the former rebel forces, was \r\nestablished on 16 March 2007. Its mission is to set up a \r\njoint force entrusted with ensuring security and the free \r\nmovement of individuals and goods throughout the \r\nnational territory. A general amnesty order was issued \r\non 11 April 2007. Disarmament effectively began with \r\nthe 30 July 2007 “peace bonfire” in Bouaké. The \r\nredeployment of the administration and reinstatement \r\nof magistrates throughout the territory has now taken \r\nplace. A plan for the return of those displaced by the \r\nwar has been put in place. Mobile courts to identify \r\nmembers of the population and update electoral lists \r\nbegan yesterday, Tuesday, 25 September 2007. We \r\nhave made major strides towards peace since the \r\nOuagadougou peace agreement. \r\n The lesson I draw from this experience of direct \r\ndialogue between State authorities and the rebels has \r\nled me to invite the international community to favour \r\nlocal solutions in the settlement of conflicts. The \r\nUnited Nations in New York should make \r\narrangements to monitor the implementation of \r\nsolutions adopted by parties to a conflict. \r\n Côte d’Ivoire will emerge from crisis. Côte \r\nd’Ivoire is emerging from crisis. Today more than ever, \r\nit needs the support of the international community to \r\nbuild peace and stability within its borders and in the \r\nWest African subregion. \r\n In this context, and given the climate of calm \r\nprevailing in the country, I would like the United \r\nNations to revise downward the security rating. Phase \r\nIII no longer reflects reality.  \r\n In the same spirit, with the implementation of the \r\nOuagadougou agreement, today Côte d’Ivoire is \r\nreunified and it is now up to the State to restore law \r\nand order throughout the territory. The agreement \r\nprovides explicitly that in the redeployment of \r\nadministrators, the forces of law and order are to take \r\npart in providing protection for administrative staff, as \r\nwell as for the citizen population. I appeal here for the \r\npartial lifting of the weapons embargo so that the \r\nIvorian State can carry out its task of protecting \r\npersons and goods. \r\n Moreover, and in the present context of national \r\nreconciliation, Ivorians remain concerned that \r\nindividual sanctions are still imposed on some of our \r\ncompatriots. Since the Ouagadougou Agreement, those \r\nyoung people have put heart and soul into the search \r\nfor peace. For that reason I am formally asking the \r\nUnited Nations, within the spirit and letter of the \r\nOuagadougou political Agreement (S/2007/144) \r\nendorsed by resolution 1765 (2007) to lift the sanctions \r\nimposed on Charles Blé Goudé, Eugène Djué and \r\nMartin Kouakou Fofie. \r\n Côte d’Ivoire is a sound country and our \r\nmanagement of public finance has made it possible for \r\nthe Ivorian State to function and to ensure a minimum \r\nstandard of living for its people. But the ongoing crisis \r\nhas ultimately led to a reduction in the financial \r\nresources available to the State and has disrupted its \r\nfinancial stability.  \r\n Today I am asking for assistance to help finance \r\nthe actions related directly to resolving the crisis, \r\nnamely: the civil service, mobile courts, general \r\nelections, the return of those displaced by war and in \r\ngeneral, peacebuilding.  \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 28 \r\n \r\n But beyond the short and medium-term actions, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire requires international aid to strengthen \r\nthe basis for a more robust economic recovery in the \r\nlong-term. We must rebuild and strengthen our \r\ncommunity infrastructures. Our schools and health \r\ncentres were damaged during the war. We must rebuild \r\nand strengthen our economic infrastructures — roads, \r\nrailways, electric and water supply stations were \r\nseverely strained by the crisis.  \r\n All observers and all actors in the crisis in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire agree that elections are the goal of the crisis \r\nresolution process in Côte d’Ivoire. The holding of \r\ntransparent, free elections that are open to all is not \r\nonly a requirement under my political culture, but is, \r\nabove all a democratic requirement. Elections are proof \r\nof good governance. I intend to make my country — \r\nCôte d’Ivoire — a modern State — that is, a State in \r\nwhich people appoint their leaders through just and \r\ntransparent elections. \r\n Democratic elections are a requirement for my \r\ncountry in order to modernize our political life. \r\nElections are also required for our economic recovery. \r\nWe absolutely must reorganize the coming elections in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire and hold them successfully in order to \r\nrestore confidence among economic actors in the \r\ncountry and abroad.  \r\n Elections are a requirement as well for stability in \r\nour country and in the subregion. We must organize \r\nelections quickly to confer political legitimacy on \r\nthose who are exercising State power in order to \r\nstabilize the society in Côte d’Ivoire and ensure \r\neconomic recovery in West Africa. Finally, elections \r\nare a constitutional imperative. According to our \r\nconstitution, when exceptional circumstances make it \r\nimpossible to hold elections — as was the case before \r\nthe country was reunified — all institutions within the \r\nRepublic function solely with a view to holding \r\nelections. For that reason, the elections must be \r\nreorganized quickly so that we can move beyond this \r\nconstitutional, but exceptional situation. \r\n For all those reasons, from this rostrum at the \r\nUnited Nations I invite all friends of Côte d’Ivoire \r\nthroughout the world, but also and above all the \r\npoliticians, both men and women, Ivorians and all \r\npeoples living in Côte d’Ivoire to become involved in \r\nthe peace process. I invite them to become fully \r\ninvested in the electoral process underway and to \r\ncontribute, each person according to his or her ability, \r\nto national reconciliation and to peacebuilding. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the Republic of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe. \r\n Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de \r\nMenezes, President of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President de Menezes: Thank you for inviting \r\nme to be here today. I bring you greetings from the \r\npeople of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe. This is my first opportunity to personally \r\ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to thank him for \r\ntaking on the huge responsibilities he has assumed as \r\nSecretary-General. We offer him our full support for \r\nthe difficult tasks ahead. \r\n I would also like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim for his election as President of the current \r\nsession and to thank Ms. Al Khalifa for her work in \r\nguiding the sixty-first session so well.  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for the choice of the \r\ntopics for this session, such as climate change, finance \r\nfor development, the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand countering terrorism. \r\n We come together this year at a time of enormous \r\nchallenges for the United Nations. The world situation \r\nis very serious. One difficulty is that the problems are \r\nof such enormous complexity that the mass of facts \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n29 07-51705 \r\n \r\npresented to the public by the media make it \r\nexceedingly difficult for average people to understand \r\nthe situation.  \r\n Many of us in this room today live far from the \r\ntroubled areas of the earth. So, it is, perhaps, hard to \r\ncomprehend the plight of long-suffering peoples like \r\nthose in Afghanistan, Darfur, Iraq, Palestine, Sierra \r\nLeone and Somalia, among so many others. But we \r\nmust reject prejudice and discrimination and end those \r\nconflicts. \r\n For those who still ignore our existence, may I \r\nremind them that my country, Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nis an African nation composed of two islands in the \r\nGulf of Guinea and independent from Portugal since \r\n12 July 1975. So, I wanted to say that we also join the \r\ncalls to defeat terrorist extremism everywhere. \r\nHowever, we have already seen that this will not be \r\nachieved by military force, but by ideas and ideals that \r\nwin hearts and minds. \r\n Regarding the Millennium Development Goals, I \r\nwant to express my regret that so little progress has \r\nbeen made towards achieving these worthy ends. How \r\ncan we ignore those who are to be helped by those \r\nGoals, the least, the last and the lost? As the Nobel \r\nLaureate Martin Luther King once said,  \r\n  “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice \r\neverywhere. We are caught in an inescapable \r\nnetwork of mutuality, tied in a single garment of \r\ndestiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all \r\nindirectly”.  \r\n I join previous speakers in saying that despite all \r\nthe technological and scientific advances, half of the \r\nworld’s population lives on less than $2 per day. \r\nTwenty per cent of everyone alive suffer from chronic \r\nhunger. Every single day, 30,000 children die \r\nneedlessly from dehydration, diarrhoea or infections, \r\nwhich could be all too easily prevented or cured. In \r\nmany countries, children are not even given a name \r\nuntil they are one month old because so many of them \r\ndo not live that long. One billion adults today are \r\nilliterate; 100 million children cannot go to school \r\nbecause of their poverty. \r\n Now, with regard to how to finance development, \r\nwe are told that globalization is the way, that a rising \r\ntide will lift all boats. But in many parts of the world \r\nthe rising tide of globalization lifted the yachts and \r\nswamped the rowboats. Can private corporations \r\nrealistically be expected to combine their \r\nentrepreneurial activities with furthering social causes? \r\nObviously, some companies must improve their \r\npractices and be held accountable for cleaning up their \r\nenvironmental disasters, such as those in the Niger \r\nDelta. But to cast companies in the role of economic \r\nreformers is unrealistic. It seems that perhaps \r\nglobalization has made the right to shop more \r\nimportant than the right to vote. \r\n At the same time, we must also be realistic about \r\nthe results of aid. It seems that international \r\norganizations sometimes suffer from poverty of \r\nexpectations. Our own people in the developing world \r\nare also at times crucified on the poverty of their own \r\ndesires. Instead of raging against our destiny, we have \r\nlowered our standards. I think the humiliation of \r\npoverty actually scorches the heart and creates despair. \r\n How can we come here year after year and see \r\nthis despair, disease and hunger and not feel enormous \r\nsorrow? We must accept that global poverty is the \r\ndisgrace of our affluent era. So how do we alleviate \r\npoverty? Many say that Africa is poor because of bad \r\ngovernance and corruption. I strongly reject that view. \r\nIs it shameful to remember how all of our countries in \r\nAfrica, all of us, were when we became independent, \r\nor how we were even more recently in Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe. \r\n Let me say a little bit about how it was and how it \r\nis in Sao Tome and Principe. The majority of people \r\ngrew up in wooden shacks, with no running water, no \r\nelectricity, no toilet and no chance for an education. In \r\n1975, the country emerged from centuries of slavery \r\nand oppressive colonialism to independence with \r\nalmost no teachers, no doctors, totally unprepared to \r\ngovern ourselves or create an economy that did not \r\ndepend on slave or contract labour as the only means \r\nof profit. We have struggled. We have stumbled. But \r\ntoday we have a vibrant and stable democracy that we \r\nare proud of. We have a high percentage of girls in \r\nschool. We have literacy rates far above the average in \r\nthe developing world. We have free health care for all \r\nof our citizens, although it is woefully inadequate for \r\nlack of funds. We have almost eradicated malaria. We \r\nhave low corruption, while also being rated among the \r\nbest countries in the world for freedom of the press. \r\nWe spend almost no money on defence and we have \r\nnever fought a war. \r\n \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 30 \r\n \r\n  The President returned to the Chair. \r\n \r\n We are grateful for aid. My people would suffer \r\neven more than they already do without the World \r\nFood Programme, for example. The World Health \r\nOrganization and the Global Fund to fight tuberculosis \r\nand malaria are working with us very well. The \r\nRepublic of Taiwan, the people of the island of \r\nFormosa, with their well-known generosity and special \r\nattention to our realities, have been crucial in our own \r\nsuccess against malaria. Many organizations and \r\nindividuals have worked with us for many years with \r\nopen hearts and generous spirits, and we thank them all \r\nfor that. \r\n Throughout our 32 years of independence, we \r\nhave followed the advice of international organizations \r\nand built up some $350 million in bilateral and \r\nmultilateral debt, most of which was recently forgiven \r\nunder the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative \r\nand other programmes. Allow me to take this \r\nopportunity to present, on behalf of the people of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, our deepest gratitude. \r\n As long as massive poverty, injustice and obscene \r\ninequality persist in our world, none of us can rest. I \r\nsay to all, please do not look the other way. Do not \r\nhesitate. The future might say that what we failed to do \r\nwas tragic, but let me also say that what we did do was \r\ntruly heroic.  \r\n Finally, before ending, and as I have done in prior \r\nyears, I wish to refer to two situations to which I call \r\nthe attention of members and implore their solidarity, \r\nregardless of whether they are poor or rich. \r\n One of those situations is the issue of Taiwan. \r\nThere are 23 million people living on Formosa island, \r\nalso called Taiwan. They do not ask the international \r\ncommunity to help them because they are poor. On the \r\ncontrary, they are one of the main recognized world \r\neconomic powers, and they are helping other countries, \r\nsuch as Sao Tome and Principe. They only ask to be \r\nrecognized as a sovereign country and to be included \r\nas such on the lists of the United Nations and its \r\nagencies. This is a question of justice.  \r\n Also a question of justice is the issue of the \r\nUnited States Government lifting the embargo against \r\nCuba, repealing the Helms-Burton Act of 1996 and \r\nallowing for free trade and free travel. Let the Cubans \r\nsettle their problems among themselves. This is a \r\ndemocratic act.  \r\n I thank all members for being here today and \r\nlistening. May God bless us all. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by His Excellency Mr. Nuri Kamel \r\nAl-Maliki, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Iraq \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear a \r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nIraq. \r\n  Mr. Nuri Kamel Al-Maliki, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have pleasure in welcoming His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nuri Kamel Al-Maliki, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Iraq, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Al-Maliki (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I am \r\nhonoured to address the General Assembly as the first \r\nPrime Minister of a constitutionally permanent \r\nGovernment representing Iraq, its people, and its \r\naspirations in cementing the foundations of democracy, \r\npeace, freedom and cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity. I come carrying the concerns of the people \r\nof the Valley of Two Rivers who built the most ancient \r\ncivilization and established the first laws, and who \r\ntoday offer humanity a lofty example in sustaining life, \r\nfacing challenges, and persisting in protecting our \r\nyoung democratic experience. \r\n The Iraqi people lived isolated from the world in \r\nthe shadow of dictatorship for 35 years. There was no \r\nfreedom of expression or belief, no multiple party \r\nsystem, no free elections, no democratic institutions, \r\nno communications systems, and no media except \r\nthose that were controlled by the Government \r\nintelligence agencies. \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n31 07-51705 \r\n \r\n Millions of victims in Iraq suffered throughout \r\nthat era in adventurous wars with two neighbouring \r\ncountries, Iran and Kuwait. Genocidal mass murder \r\nwas committed inside Iraq, such as during the \r\nal-Anfaal campaign and in Halabja. In addition, there \r\nwere mass graves, horrific prison cells and detention \r\ncamps, and the immense destruction that plagued the \r\ninfrastructure of the various governmental institutions. \r\n Today in the new Iraq, there are hundreds of \r\nparties active within 20 political alliances. There are \r\nmore than 6,000 civil society organizations, hundreds \r\nof newspapers and magazines, 40 local and satellite TV \r\nstations, as well as the offices of foreign \r\ncorrespondents from all over the world working \r\nwithout restrictions or conditions. \r\n The new Iraq is being targeted today. Terrorism \r\nkills civilians, journalists, artists, intellectuals and \r\nprofessionals; it attacks universities, marketplaces and \r\nlibraries; it blows up mosques and churches and \r\ndestroys the infrastructure of State institutions. We \r\nconsider terrorism to be an extension of the fallen \r\ndictatorship, although it may vary in its external form \r\nor in the gangs that carry it out. Terrorism seeks to \r\nabort the political process and to ignite sectarian strife \r\nas a prelude to hijacking Iraq back into the era of \r\ntyranny, oppression and backwardness. \r\n Car bombs, explosive vests in public places and \r\nthe display of decapitated heads on television are all \r\nmessages of threat and intimidation that terrorists send \r\nto the world community, the bloody chapters of which \r\nwere executed in Algeria, Spain, England, France, \r\nLebanon, Turkey and here in New York. We are \r\nsteadfast and determined to exterminate and defeat \r\nterrorism in Iraq so that it does not spread through the \r\ncountries of the world, repeating the tragedy. \r\n Iraq, which carries the greater burden in \r\nconfronting terrorism, calls upon the nations of the \r\nworld to help and join in its efforts to fight the scourge \r\nof terrorism. Our battle aims at providing security, \r\nstability and prosperity, and at protecting our \r\ndemocratic experience. We are determined to be \r\nvictorious in our battle, which will be a victory for \r\nhumanity. The fierce onslaught of terror against Iraq \r\nsince the fall of the dictatorship has not stopped our \r\npeople, through three epic elections, from laying the \r\ngroundwork for a democratic experience unique in \r\nIraq’s history and the region, in which, as a permanent \r\nConstitution was voted upon, a parliament was elected \r\nand a National Unity Government was established. \r\n The new Iraq living through its nascent \r\ndemocratic experience is governed by constitutional \r\ninstitutions, in which freedom of opinion, belief and \r\nexpression are respected. That Iraq will not retreat \r\nfrom its democratic option, for which our people have \r\npaid a very high price. Our position requires the \r\nsupport and cooperation of the world’s nations so that \r\nIraq can build a modern State that guarantees justice, \r\nequality and respect for religious, intellectual, sectarian \r\nand ethnic pluralism. \r\n Our people, who have enjoyed the taste of \r\nfreedom after eras of tyranny and oppression, will \r\ncontinue on the road towards building a State of \r\ninstitutions, reinforcing the authority of law, respecting \r\nhuman rights, and the active participation of women in \r\nall areas. The national reconciliation and dialogue \r\ninitiative that I launched upon assuming my \r\nresponsibility as the Prime Minister of the National \r\nUnity Government did not come out of thin air. Its \r\nstrength arises from the Iraqi people’s civilization and \r\ncultural heritage, which have made great contributions \r\nto humankind. Iraqis have lived in peace, brotherhood, \r\nforgiveness and tolerance since the dawn of history. \r\nTheir religious, national, sectarian and ethnic diversity \r\nhave been elements of strength, reinforcing national \r\nunity. \r\n We think of national reconciliation as a life boat, \r\na perpetual peace project and a safe harbour for the \r\npolitical process and the democratic experience. We \r\nalso believe that national reconciliation is not the \r\nresponsibility of the Government alone. It is a \r\ncollective responsibility held by the political powers, \r\nintellectual leaders, religious leaders, the educated, \r\ncivil society organizations and all the active powers in \r\nthe Iraqi arena. National reconciliation is the strategic \r\nchoice that has saved our country from slipping into \r\nthe pit of a sectarian war that was planned by the \r\nenemies of freedom and democracy after they blew up \r\nthe tomb of the two Askari imams in Samara. \r\n National reconciliation is not a dinner party \r\nprepared between those in dispute, nor is it a dose of \r\nmedicine, as some might think. It is a realistic vision \r\nthat counteracts the burdensome legacy of the fallen \r\nregime in all areas. It lays the foundation for political, \r\nsocial and economic progress and the security that we \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 32 \r\n \r\nstrive for. Furthermore, it cements the principles of the \r\nnew political system. \r\n National reconciliation is the olive branch that \r\nblossomed into the formation of support councils in \r\nmany of our provinces and Iraqi cities. It was also \r\nsuccessful in leading some 28,000 citizens from Iraqi \r\ntribes to join our military efforts to combat terrorism. It \r\nhas resulted in the restoration of security in our cities, \r\nvillages and provinces, including in Al-Anbar \r\nprovince, which has been liberated from the Al-Qaida \r\nterrorist organization. The terrorists fled from there, \r\nonly to face another defeat, this time in Diyala \r\nprovince. Thus, Al-Qaida is losing its safe havens, one \r\nby one. \r\n Indeed, national reconciliation is stronger than \r\nthe weapons of terrorism. It caused the reintegration of \r\nmore than 14,000 people who had been members of \r\narmed groups that splintered off from Al-Qaida. Those \r\nfighters stood alongside our armed forces and the \r\nmultinational forces battling Al-Qaida, dealing \r\ndevastating blows to that terrorist organization.  \r\n The practical accomplishments that have been \r\nachieved through constant mobilization for national \r\nreconciliation are considered important successes, in \r\ncontrast to the great challenges facing Iraq and the \r\nexperiences of people who have suffered from \r\ndictatorships and civil and sectarian wars. \r\n We emphasize that the acts of sectarian violence \r\nbeing committed in Iraq are not perpetrated by the \r\nmain elements of society, but rather by extremists and \r\nfanatics belonging to various groups. We have been \r\nsuccessful in largely containing this problem. The \r\naverage number of sectarian killings has decreased and \r\nsecurity and stability have been restored in many \r\nformer hot spots. That has helped the return of \r\nthousands of displaced families to their homes. We are \r\nresolved to fight any and all outlaws, regardless of \r\ntheir sectarian or political affiliations. Our armed \r\nforces have been steadfast in establishing law and \r\norder and in instilling a sense of respect for the \r\nGovernment in many provinces whose residents have \r\ndiverse religious, sectarian and ethnic affiliations. \r\n The skills and capabilities of our security and \r\nmilitary agencies have grown swiftly as they have \r\nconfronted terrorist organizations, militias and \r\norganized crime groups. However, they need further \r\ntraining and development so that they can quickly take \r\nover from the multinational forces the responsibility \r\nfor security throughout Iraq. Having proved our ability \r\nto provide security in eight provinces, we are prepared \r\nto assume full and swift responsibility for security so \r\nthat we can protect the democratic achievements of our \r\npeople. We shall work to ensure that our armed forces \r\nact in a professional manner and are loyal first and \r\nforemost to our country, not to an individual party, sect \r\nor ethnicity. \r\n In addition to those achievements, the \r\nGovernment of National Unity has begun the process \r\nof reconstruction. We have voted on the largest budget \r\nin Iraq’s contemporary history. With the cooperation of \r\nparliament, we have adopted the investment law, which \r\nis considered a step forward that will stimulate the \r\nIraqi economy and move it from a centrally based \r\nsystem to one based on free enterprise and a market \r\neconomy. That in turn will help to fulfil our people’s \r\naspirations to development, prosperity and well-being. \r\nIn addition, the Government has finalized a draft law \r\nfor oil and gas, which if approved by parliament will \r\nensure fair distribution of wealth, since oil is \r\nconsidered the property of all Iraqis. \r\n The Government also continues to adopt and \r\nimplement other laws in various areas. We have taken \r\npractical steps to improve our people’s living \r\nconditions, to increase salaries and pensions, to combat \r\nunemployment and to expand the efforts of the social \r\nwelfare network. The Government is determined that \r\nnext year will be dedicated to promoting the service \r\nsector in order to alleviate the hardships and suffering \r\nof our citizens.  \r\n We understand that these promising steps do not \r\nfulfil all our aspirations and that we have a long way to \r\ngo until we achieve our goal of a secure, stable and \r\nprosperous Iraq. We hope that the international \r\ncommunity will support Iraq and help it to achieve that \r\nnoble goal.  \r\n We believe that security is an integrated system. \r\nA secure and stable Iraq will be in the best interests of \r\nthe region and of the world as a whole. We have \r\nwarned all countries in the region that the relentless \r\nflow of weapons, money and suicide bombers and the \r\nspreading of fatwas that incite hatred and murder will \r\nonly spell disaster for the peoples of the region and the \r\nentire world. \r\n After the Government of National Unity was \r\nformed, we took the initiative to improve Iraq’s \r\nrelationship with neighbouring countries. We also took \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n33 07-51705 \r\n \r\npains to make our common borders peaceful and \r\neconomically prosperous areas. The foreign policy of \r\nthe new Iraq is based on our permanent Constitution, \r\nwhich does not allow our land to be used against our \r\nneighbours and prohibits foreign interference in our \r\ninternal affairs. Today, we feel optimistic that countries \r\nin the region are aware of the danger of the terrorist \r\nonslaught against Iraq and that a weak Iraq is not in \r\ntheir interests. A strong and democratic Iraq will be a \r\nguarantee of security and stability in the region. \r\n Because of its new policies, Iraq has become a \r\nplace for negotiations and dialogue between feuding \r\nregional and international entities. We will take steps to \r\nreinforce that positive role, adopting a policy of \r\nimproving conditions, defusing crises and banishing \r\nthe spectre of war and conflict from the region. We \r\nfirmly believe that tension and instability undermine \r\nsecurity not only in Iraq, but throughout the region and \r\nthe world. \r\n Iraq, which in recent decades has been a hotbed \r\nof tension in the region, is now qualified, by virtue of \r\nits material and human resources, to serve as a \r\nplatform for regional and international economic \r\ncooperation. That will contribute to the establishment \r\nof an economic system that will produce development \r\nand prosperity for the peoples and countries of the \r\nregion. \r\n We also wish to express our sincere desire to \r\nestablish the best possible relationship with the \r\ninternational community. We believe that Iraq must be \r\nopen to all countries, developing relationships and \r\nbenefiting from the experiences of other democracies. \r\n As I stand before leaders and representatives of \r\nthe world’s nations, I must recall that the Iraqi people \r\ncontinue to pay the price for the reckless politics of the \r\nprevious, fallen regime and to experience the \r\nconsequences of international resolutions, especially \r\nthose relating to its weapons programme and its \r\ninvasion of the brotherly State of Kuwait. Those \r\nresolutions, which were exploited by the previous \r\nregime for political gain, have caused much damage to \r\nour infrastructure, service sector and education and \r\nhealth systems. Our people are looking to the \r\ninternational community for help in repairing that \r\ndamage and lifting the heavy burdens of debt and \r\nreparation.  \r\n The Iraqi people will remember the countries that \r\nmade sacrifices and stood alongside them in bringing \r\ndown the dictator’s regime. They will remember those \r\nwho helped them during the transition to a democratic \r\nand pluralistic federal system. Moreover, they will \r\nalways respect and appreciate the countries and \r\nGovernments that support their political process and \r\nparticipate in the reconstruction process.  \r\n Our efforts, in partnership with the international \r\ncommunity, to achieve economic progress and social \r\njustice culminated in success with the signing of the \r\nInternational Compact with Iraq and the \r\nimplementation of its provisions. That document \r\nrepresents a new stage in the development of balanced \r\nrelationships between Iraq and other Governments \r\nthroughout the world. It is a point of departure in the \r\nbuilding of a democratic, pluralistic, federal Iraq where \r\nall citizens are equal and will benefit from fair \r\ndistribution of wealth after the burdens of debt, \r\nunemployment, and administrative and financial \r\ncorruption left over from the days of the former regime \r\nhave been lifted. \r\n We hope that the countries concerned will comply \r\nwith the provisions of the International Compact with \r\nIraq. That will help the international community and \r\nencourage it to play its role in reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment and in supporting national reconciliation \r\nand the democratic experience. \r\n Many of the region’s problems and crises can be \r\nresolved through constructive and focused dialogue. In \r\norder to maintain peace and security, our region must \r\nabandon the path of war and adventure, which has led \r\nto increased harm and suffering for the people. \r\n Within this framework, we call for recognition of \r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people, for assistance to \r\nthem in establishing an independent State, and for the \r\nreturn of occupied Arab lands in accordance with \r\ninternational resolutions. The elimination of weapons \r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East will indeed \r\nguarantee a just and comprehensive peace.  \r\n We call for the intensification of national, Arab \r\nand international efforts to help Lebanon and its \r\npolitical authorities to transcend the state of division \r\nand to bar interference in its internal affairs so that \r\nLebanon can regain its national unity and \r\ncohesiveness.  \r\n To forge partnerships and to achieve peace, \r\nstability and prosperity, we must bolster cooperation \r\namong all countries of the world and must work \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 34 \r\n \r\ntogether to attain the noble goals of the United Nations. \r\nThis also necessitates ensuring equal and balanced \r\nrelationships among States and developing a more fair \r\nand just global order by helping economically \r\ndisadvantaged developing countries and reducing the \r\ndevelopment gap between poor and rich nations. \r\n We support an active United Nations role in the \r\ninternational arena, peacefully resolving crises once it \r\nattains all the elements and support that it needs to play \r\nthat important role. We call upon the United Nations to \r\nadopt peaceful initiatives that can help defuse \r\nconflicts, save people from the scourge of war and \r\nestablish international security and stability. That will \r\nguarantee the rights and interests of all nations and will \r\nreinforce partnerships and cooperation among them. It \r\nwill also provide the necessary environment for solving \r\nthe problems and crises that face the world in a fair and \r\njust way.  \r\n Finally, on behalf of the Iraqi people, I wish to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also \r\nwant to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who \r\nplayed an important role in the United Nations \r\nadoption of the International Compact with Iraq to help \r\nIraq carry out its reform programme of political, \r\neconomic and security reform. My deep appreciation \r\ngoes also to all countries that signed the Compact. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n The President: I give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Felipe Pérez Roque, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, who will also speak on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n Mr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nNever before have the real dangers awaiting the human \r\nspecies become so evident; never before have the \r\nviolations of international law become so evident, as \r\nthey increasingly jeopardize international peace and \r\nsecurity; never before have inequality and exclusion \r\nbecome so evident, as they impact over two thirds of \r\nthe population on our planet. \r\n Putting an end to wastefulness and to the \r\nunbridled consumerism fostered by the large \r\ncorporations and the power groups of a handful of \r\ndeveloped countries — which throw money away at the \r\ncost of poverty and the perpetuation of \r\nunderdevelopment in a vast periphery of poor countries \r\nwhere billions of people scramble to make a living — \r\nhas become a key factor for the survival of mankind. \r\nThe high-level meeting of this General Assembly held \r\nonly two days ago emphasized the danger posed by the \r\naccelerated global warming that is already affecting us \r\nand by its effect on climate change. Action must be \r\ntaken — and quickly. The developed countries have the \r\nmoral duty and the historic responsibility to set the \r\nexample and spearhead the effort. \r\n On the other hand, several of our countries, \r\nalways from the South, continue to fall prey to \r\nunacceptable acts of aggression by the ever-powerful, \r\nwhich are essentially driven by the insatiable hunger \r\nfor strategic resources. The wars of conquest and the \r\nproclamation and implementation of doctrines based on \r\npre-emptive wars — which do not exclude the use of \r\nnuclear weapons, even against non-nuclear States — \r\nand the repeated use of pretexts such as the alleged war \r\non terror, the supposed promotion of democracy or \r\nso-called regime change in countries that are \r\nunilaterally labelled as rogue States are today the \r\ngreatest and most serious threat to peace and security \r\nin the world. \r\n Aggression and illegal occupation of countries, \r\nmilitary intervention contrary to international law and \r\nthe purposes and principles enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter, the bombing of civilians and torture \r\ncontinue to be daily practices. Under the false litany of \r\nfreedom and democracy, an attempt is made to justify \r\nthe pillaging of the natural resources in the third world \r\nand to control zones of increasing geo-strategic \r\nimportance. That and no other is the imperial \r\ndomination plan that the mightiest military superpower \r\never to exist intends to impose through blood and fire. \r\n Far from behaving in international relations \r\naccording to the principles of solidarity, social and \r\ninternational justice, equality and development for all, \r\nthere is no hesitation at all in employing the practices \r\nof certifying countries, of imposing unilateral \r\nblockades and of threatening through aggression, \r\nblackmail and coercion. If a small country defends its \r\nright to independence, it is accused of being a rogue \r\nState; if a Power launches an attack against a country, \r\nit is said that it liberates them; a fighter against foreign \r\naggression is a terrorist; an attacking soldier is a \r\nfreedom fighter. That is the media war, the twisting of \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n35 07-51705 \r\n \r\ntruths, the tyranny of monolithic thinking in a \r\nglobalized world. \r\n Instead of moving towards general and complete \r\ndisarmament — including nuclear disarmament, which \r\nhas been an ongoing demand of the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries for decades — what we see is \r\nthe promotion of the arms race and the squandering of \r\nwealth on new weapons and arms systems that deplete \r\nthe resources that the world needs to mitigate the \r\neffects of climate change and address the very serious \r\nproblems stemming from poverty and marginalization. \r\n An attempt is made to prevent, in a politicized \r\nand selective fashion, the implementation of the \r\nprinciple — already proclaimed in the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty — that nations have the right \r\nto the development of nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes. Some countries are threatened with war and \r\ndestruction while the aggressive ally is permitted to \r\nhave hundreds of nuclear devices and is constantly \r\nhelped to modernize them. \r\n How much longer will it take and how many new \r\nvictims will have to die before the hawks of war \r\nunderstand that weapons are useless in resolving the \r\ncritical problems of humankind? On a day like today, it \r\nis worth recalling the words uttered by President Fidel \r\nCastro in this General Assembly in October 1979: \r\n  “Let us say farewell to arms, and let us in a \r\ncivilized manner dedicate ourselves to the most \r\npressing problems of our times. This is the \r\nresponsibility, this is the most sacred duty of the \r\nstatesmen of all the world. Moreover, this is the \r\nbasic premise for human survival.” (A/34/PV.31, \r\npara. 147) \r\n There has been no progress to date towards \r\nfulfilling the Millennium Goals and the decisions of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences held over the \r\npast decade. Poverty has not decreased. Inequality \r\namong and within countries is on the rise. Drinking \r\nwater is not accessible to 1.1 billion people; 2.6 billion \r\nlack health services; over 800 million are illiterate and \r\n115 million children do not attend primary school; 850 \r\nmillion starve every day. One per cent of the world’s \r\nrichest people own 40 per cent of the wealth, while 50 \r\nper cent of the world’s population has barely \r\n1 per cent. All this is happening in a world that spends \r\na trillion dollars on weapons and another trillion on \r\nadvertising. \r\n The nearly 1 billion people living in developed \r\ncountries consume approximately half of all the energy, \r\nwhile 2 billion poor people are still not acquainted with \r\nelectricity. Is that the world that they want us to \r\naccept? Is that, by any chance, the future that we \r\nshould settle for? Are we entitled or not to fight to \r\nchange that state of things? Should we or should we \r\nnot fight to make a better world possible? \r\n Why are such colossal resources squandered on \r\nthe killing industry and not used to save lives? Why are \r\nschools not built instead of nuclear submarines, and \r\nhospitals instead of “smart” bombs? Why are vaccines \r\nnot produced instead of armoured vehicles, and more \r\nfood instead of more fighter jets? Why is there no \r\nmomentum given to research to fight AIDS, malaria \r\nand tuberculosis instead of promoting the manufacture \r\nof anti-missile shields? Why is there no war waged \r\nagainst poverty instead of against the poor? \r\n Despite the fact that only $150 billion is needed \r\nto meet the Millennium Goals, we hear the hypocritical \r\nassertion that there is no source from which to obtain \r\nthe necessary financial resources. That is a lie. There is \r\nmoney in abundance; what is lacking is the political \r\nwill, ethics and the real commitment of those who have \r\nto make a choice. \r\n If they really want money to appear, let the \r\ncommitment of setting aside 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational product as official development assistance be \r\nmet once and for all. That would require $141 billion \r\nover and above the current amounts. At the height of \r\ndeceit, the donor countries are now auditing the \r\ncancellations of a debt that they know they will not be \r\nable to collect in order to artificially inflate their \r\ncontributions. Let the foreign debt, which our countries \r\nhave already paid more than once, be cancelled. That \r\nwould make it possible to set aside for development the \r\nover $400 billion currently used to service a debt that \r\ndoes not cease to grow. \r\n Let the Doha Round for development come to an \r\nend and let the $300 billion in agricultural subsidies for \r\nthe developed countries be removed. That would make \r\nit possible to earmark that money to fight rural poverty \r\nand food insecurity and to ensure fair prices for the \r\nexport products of the underdeveloped countries. \r\n Let our right to development be recognized. Let \r\nour right to have access to markets, patents and \r\ntechnologies be guaranteed, for those are now the \r\nexclusive monopoly of the powerful. Let our countries \r\nA/62/PV.6 \r\n \r\n07-51705 36 \r\n \r\nbe helped in training professionals and scientists and \r\nlet the brain drain stop. \r\n The non-aligned countries need no alms; we need \r\nand demand justice. Let our rights to cultural diversity \r\nbe respected, as well as our right to the preservation of \r\nour heritage, our symbols and our idiosyncrasies. That \r\nwas the unanimous demand made in Tehran by the \r\nnon-aligned countries at our ministerial meeting on \r\nhuman rights and cultural diversity. \r\n The non-aligned countries want a more \r\ndemocratic and transparent United Nations in which \r\nthe General Assembly, its most representative and \r\ndemocratic body, can truly implement the powers \r\nvested in it. We need a United Nations with a reformed \r\nSecurity Council, acting in conformity with the \r\nmandate granted to it by the Organization’s Charter \r\nwithout infringing on the functions and prerogatives of \r\nother organs of the system. There must be a Security \r\nCouncil with an expanded membership in line with the \r\ncurrent composition of the United Nations, where the \r\nunderdeveloped countries are the majority. There must \r\nbe a Security Council with a radical modification to its \r\nworking methods in order to allow transparency and \r\nthe access of all Member States to its deliberations. \r\n We need a Human Rights Council that prevents \r\nthe repetition of the serious mistakes made by the \r\nformer Commission on Human Rights. The Council \r\nshould enshrine in its practices the principle that \r\nhuman rights are universal, indivisible and \r\ninterdependent. It should put an end to selectivity and \r\ndouble standards. The non-aligned countries will \r\nfirmly oppose the devilish schemes of some mighty \r\nquarters that, frustrated as they are at failing to achieve \r\ntheir goals, are now attempting to reopen and call into \r\nquestion the agreement reached in the hard and \r\ndifficult process of institution-building in the Council. \r\n The non-aligned countries will not give up on \r\ndefence of the precepts that underlie our movement. \r\nAmong the nations, we will foster relations of \r\nfriendship based on respect for the principles of \r\nsovereignty, equality of rights and the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples. \r\n We will continue to defend the right of the grief-\r\nstricken and heroic people of Palestine to have their \r\nown State, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We will \r\ncontinue to condemn the genocide committed against \r\nit. We will continue to proclaim the right of the people \r\nof Puerto Rico to sovereignty and to independence. The \r\nnon-aligned countries account for nearly two thirds of \r\nthe membership of the United Nations. Our demands \r\nwill not be forgotten or our interests ignored.  \r\n This was supposed to be the end of my statement \r\nas Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement. However, the \r\nshameless and gross behaviour of the United States \r\nPresident in this Hall yesterday morning now forces me \r\nto utter a few remarks on Cuba’s behalf. \r\n With foul language and an arrogant tone, \r\nPresident Bush insulted and threatened some 10 \r\ncountries. He gave orders in a firm and authoritarian \r\nfashion to the General Assembly, and with an \r\nofficiousness never before seen in this Hall he dished \r\nout terms and judgments on a score of countries. It was \r\nan embarrassing show — the delirium tremens of the \r\nworld’s policeman, the intoxication of imperial power \r\nimbued with the mediocrity and cynicism of those who \r\nthreaten to launch wars in which they know their lives \r\nare not at stake. \r\n The President of the United States has no right to \r\npass judgment on any other sovereign nation on this \r\nplanet. Having powerful nuclear weapons offers no \r\nright whatsoever to tread upon the rights of the peoples \r\nof the other 191 countries that are represented here. \r\nAnd the determination and courage of peoples should \r\nnot be underestimated when it comes to defending their \r\nrights. After all, what prevails is not the power of \r\ncannons but the fairness of the ideas for which you are \r\nfighting. The warmongering and menacing President \r\nshould have already learned this by now: sovereign \r\nequality of States, not regime change; respect for \r\nsovereignty, not unilateral certifications of good \r\nbehaviour; respect for international law, not illegal \r\nblockades and wars. \r\n President Bush talked about democracy, but we \r\nall know that he is lying. He came into office through \r\nfraud and deceit. We would have been spared his \r\npresence yesterday and would have listened to \r\nPresident Albert Gore talking about climate change and \r\nthe risks to our species. We also recall how he brazenly \r\nsupported the coup d’état against the President and the \r\nconstitution of Venezuela. \r\n He talked about peace, but we know that he is \r\nlying. We remember well when he threatened 60 or \r\nmore countries, which he called “dark corners of the \r\nworld”, saying that he would wipe them off the face of \r\nthe Earth with pre-emptive surprise attacks. Bush is a \r\nstrange warrior who, from the rearguard, sends the \r\n A/62/PV.6\r\n \r\n37 07-51705 \r\n \r\nyoung people of his country to kill and to die \r\nthousands of kilometres away. \r\n He talked about human rights, but we know that \r\nhe is lying. He is responsible for the death of 600,000 \r\ncivilians in Iraq; he authorized tortures at the \r\nGuantánamo naval base and at Abu Ghraib; and he is \r\nan accessory to the kidnapping and disappearance of \r\npeople, as well as to the secret flights and the \r\nclandestine prisons. \r\n He talked about the fight against terrorism, but \r\nwe know that he is lying. He has ensured complete \r\nimpunity for the most abominable terrorist groups \r\nwhich, from Miami, have perpetrated horrendous \r\ncrimes against the Cuban people. President Bush \r\nattacked the new Human Rights Council. He is \r\nbleeding from his wound; he is grunting his \r\nhelplessness. He is haunted by the shamefulness that, \r\nduring his term in office, the United States cannot even \r\nlook forward to being a member because elections are \r\nthrough secret ballot. Cuba, on the other hand, was \r\nelected as a founding member of the Council with more \r\nthan two thirds of the votes. \r\n He talked about cooperation, development and \r\nprosperity for the rest of the world, but we all know \r\nthat he is lying. He has been the most selfish and \r\nreckless politician we have ever seen. In a world that \r\nthis year will bear witness to the death of 10 million \r\nchildren under the age of five through preventable \r\ndiseases, his self-seeking and empty proposals of \r\nyesterday are but a sick joke. \r\n President Bush has no moral authority or \r\ncredibility to judge anyone. He should be held \r\naccountable to the world for his crimes. There is a limit \r\nto both arrogance and hypocrisy. There is a limit to lies \r\nand blackmail. Cuba rejects and condemns every one \r\nof the mendacious words uttered yesterday by the \r\nPresident of the United States. \r\n Cuba appreciates the solidarity it has received \r\nfrom the General Assembly in its struggle against the \r\nblockade and the aggression that it has been forced to \r\nendure for nearly five decades. In particular, I thank \r\nthe President of Nicaragua, Comrade Daniel Ortega, \r\nwho is here in the Hall, for his kind words yesterday, \r\nand I thank all those who have spoken out for the rights \r\nand justice for the Cuban people. Cuba thanks all those \r\nwho have supported its tenacious fight against \r\nterrorism and have raised their voice in favour of the \r\nrelease of five Cuban anti-terrorism fighters unjustly \r\nimprisoned in the United States. \r\n Cuba will fight, along with all other members of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, in order to achieve a more \r\njust and democratic international order, in which our \r\npeoples can exercise their right to peace and \r\ndevelopment. We may be accused of being dreamers, \r\nbut we are fighting with the conviction that today’s \r\ndreams will be tomorrow’s realities. We are fighting — \r\nand we will not stop fighting — with the conviction \r\nthat even when there are individuals without decorum, \r\nthere are always others who have in themselves the \r\ndecorum of many and who bear within themselves an \r\nentire nations, as well as human dignity. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
