(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of \r\nState of the Kingdom of Swaziland \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will hear an \r\naddress by the Head of State of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland. \r\n His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n King Mswati: It is a great pleasure for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. \r\n Let me begin by extending warm greetings from \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland to the entire United Nations \r\nfamily.  \r\n It befits this moment that I extend our \r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, upon his appointment. We trust that he will \r\ncontinue in the footsteps of his predecessors in \r\ncarrying out the important mission of the United \r\nNations. The Kingdom of Swaziland pledges its \r\nsupport to him as he continues to promote and protect \r\nthe noble goals of multilateralism. \r\n The role of the United Nations is to promote \r\npeace and security, sustainable development, human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. The United Nations \r\nshould continue to shape situations for the betterment \r\nof the lives of all the peoples of the world. If it is to \r\nsucceed, there is a need for the United Nations to \r\nreform its main bodies. We have met regionally as \r\ncountries; consensus decisions have been reached and \r\nrecommendations made, and we look forward to their \r\nimplementation. As the United Nations achieves \r\nreform, it is likely to undertake meaningful action so \r\nthat when decisions are taken, the Organization will be \r\nrespected by all. \r\n Many of our countries the world over are facing \r\ncountless challenges, and we look to this Organization \r\nto come up with lasting solutions. My country, \r\nSwaziland, is still undertaking development \r\nprogrammes to implement the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals that were set by the United \r\nNations for individual countries to achieve. We have \r\nprogrammes for building a very sound economy so that \r\nour people will have good jobs that will make their \r\nliving standards better. \r\n As part of our human capital development and \r\ncapacity-building programme, we are educating and \r\ntraining our people in every aspect to acquire more \r\nknowledge and information, and we look to the well-\r\ndeveloped countries to share their experiences and \r\nideas. \r\n One area of great concern is that, as we continue \r\nto implement our development programmes, we are \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 2 \r\n \r\nfaced with the challenges of globalization that will \r\naffect our preferential markets. That will be \r\ndetrimental to us, the developing countries, since \r\ncompanies have big loans to repay that were taken out \r\non the basis of better markets. We hope that, as the \r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) rules come into \r\nforce, there shall be considerations to ensure that all \r\ndeveloping countries meet WTO standards. In that way, \r\nwe shall be able to implement the rules equitably and \r\neffectively. \r\n HIV/AIDS and other health problems remain \r\nsome of the major challenges that we face as \r\ndeveloping nations. We have programmes in place that \r\nwe are trying to follow in dealing with the situation, \r\nbut we are unable to meet our targets because of our \r\nlimited resources. We have heard of many foundations \r\nthat have been announced worldwide and we hope to \r\nbe able to access them. We look forward to those \r\nresponsible for such foundations sharing the \r\ninformation on how to reach the funds, as well as \r\ntechnical support. \r\n We acknowledge the contribution made by the \r\nGlobal Fund in the fight against the scourge. My \r\ncountry is one of the beneficiaries of such funding, and \r\nwe have been able to offer a lot of comfort to many of \r\nour people. We encourage the United Nations to \r\ncontinue to appeal on our behalf for continued support \r\nin eradicating the problem of HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis, to name just a few. \r\n We also recognize the role of various United \r\nNations agencies working with our communities in the \r\nprovision of shelter, nutritional support and education \r\nto mitigate the effects of the pandemic. I am pleased to \r\nstate that our fight is showing some signs of success, as \r\nrecent statistics have shown a decline in the prevalence \r\nrate. \r\n We are faced with persistent droughts that have \r\nset us back as we continue to develop our country, and \r\nthat has been worsened by the wildfires that have \r\nrecently occurred, destroying properties, crops, \r\nlivestock and our forest industry. My country is doing \r\neverything it can to help those that have been affected \r\nby this unfortunate situation. We would like to thank \r\nthe countries and organizations that have come forward \r\nto help us during this period of hardship and we do \r\nmake an appeal to others for support; which is still \r\nneeded. \r\n Some of the problems I have mentioned that are \r\naffecting my country are the result of climate changes. \r\nThat is why we believe that the summit we had is very \r\nimportant, and we would like to commend the \r\nSecretary-General for convening the high-level summit \r\non climate change held earlier this week. A political \r\nmomentum has been generated, and it is our hope that \r\nthe necessary negotiations on the matter will \r\ncommence in Bali later this year during the meeting of \r\nthe parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland has developed some \r\nsector policies that are climate-change friendly, such as \r\nour pro-green energy policy and water resources \r\npolicy, to mention a couple. However, there is a need to \r\nenhance education, training and public awareness with \r\nregard to the adaptation and promotion of individual \r\nand institutional capacity-building in order to manage \r\nappropriate technology development and transfer. \r\n We note that there is a general need for \r\nfavourable access to and transfer of environmentally \r\nsound technologies, in particular from developed \r\ncountries to developing countries, through supportive \r\nmeasures that promote technology cooperation. This \r\nwill enable the necessary technological know-how to \r\nbe transferred and economic, technical and managerial \r\ncapabilities to be built for the efficient use and further \r\ndevelopment of transferred skills. \r\n We would like to encourage the private sector, \r\nand in particular the multinational corporations, to be \r\nresponsible enough to practise the same environmental \r\nand waste management principles in the developing \r\nworld. We would also like to discourage the \r\nirresponsible dumping of harmful waste materials in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland is deeply committed \r\nto the United Nations Charter. Moreover, recent events \r\nin the world have been living proof that the United \r\nNations is needed now more than ever before. Sadly, \r\nthe realities of wars and violence still continue in \r\ndifferent parts of the world. Conflicts, tensions and \r\nterrorism continue to destroy the social and economic \r\nfabric of the era that we are living in. \r\n We welcome the report of the Secretary-General \r\non the relationship between disarmament and \r\ndevelopment (A/62/112), in particular its recognition \r\nthat armed violence and conflict impede the realization \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n3 07-51711 \r\n \r\nIn this regard we applaud the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme for its efforts to prevent \r\narmed violence through its contribution to the \r\ndisarmament and development agenda by promoting \r\nand participating in a number of policy-oriented \r\ninitiatives. \r\n We further commend the efforts of the United \r\nNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in \r\nAfrica both for its continuation of the operation of the \r\nsmall arms and light weapons register for Africa for \r\nparticipating States, with a view to promoting \r\ntransparency in the flows of small arms and light \r\nweapons, and for its programme entitled “African \r\nSecurity Sector Reform Programme”, which carries the \r\nobjective of transforming governance within the \r\nAfrican security sector. \r\n However, we are concerned about the situation in \r\nSomalia and Darfur and its far-reaching consequences \r\nfor regional security. The continued human suffering in \r\nthis region is unacceptable, and we hope that current \r\nefforts aimed at improving the situation will not be \r\ndeprived of the opportunity to succeed. On a more \r\npositive note, we welcome the Security Council \r\ndecision to deploy the joint African Union-United \r\nNations hybrid peacekeeping force. \r\n The Middle East continues to face challenges and \r\nthe accumulation of crises and tensions in the region. It \r\nis therefore imperative that all parties concerned make \r\nan effort to achieve comprehensive, fair, just and \r\ndurable settlements. \r\n I would like to take this time to applaud the \r\nUnited Nations for its role in promoting its Charter, \r\nespecially the principle of universality. There is one \r\ncountry, however, that is not benefiting from this \r\nprinciple, as it has been excluded from the family of \r\nnations. \r\n I am talking about Taiwan: the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland wishes to reiterate its appeal to the United \r\nNations with respect to the question of Taiwan. We \r\nnote that Taiwan exercised a well-founded right in \r\ninternational law to apply for membership in the \r\nUnited Nations. Regrettably, the application was \r\nrejected without due process. \r\n The Government and people of Taiwan have \r\nshown their willingness and capacity to contribute \r\nactively to global development and peace, through \r\ndisaster relief and health and development support to \r\nmany regions. We continue to support the cause of the \r\nover 23 million people of Taiwan who are not \r\nrepresented in the one organization that should be truly \r\nglobal. I would like to challenge all nations to take my \r\nappeal seriously. \r\n While our world experiences ever-accelerating \r\npolitical, economic and social changes, it is vital that \r\nwe cooperate with each other in order to tackle and \r\nmanage these issues. Cordial, balanced and respectful \r\nrelations between nations based on the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter will enable us all to meet and \r\novercome future challenges of our time, and make this \r\nworld a safer place for future generations.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Želijko Komšić, Chairman of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. \r\n Mr. Želijko Komšić, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Želijko Komšić, Chairman \r\nof the Presidency of the Bosnia and Herzegovina, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Komšić (spoke in Bosnian; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): It is my honour to \r\nparticipate in this meeting of the General Assembly’s \r\nsixty-second session as Chairman of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n I would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nassumption of the presidency, and to express my \r\nrespect and gratitude to Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa for successfully presiding over the sixty-\r\nfirst session. \r\n The United Nations and all other organizations \r\ndepend on the collective strength of their members. \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 4 \r\n \r\nThat strength should be drawn from the consensus of \r\nthe Member States. On that note, I would like to \r\nexpress my regret for the loss of momentum in \r\nSecurity Council reform. For the past several years, our \r\ncountries’ representatives have met at the global level \r\nand have been prepared to realize the goals of the \r\nMillennium Declaration, in which the United Nations \r\nplays a distinguished role. \r\n It is well-known that, in the recent past, my \r\ncountry paid a high price for the imperfect and \r\ninefficient United Nations system. The United Nations \r\nadmitted its mistake and emphasized in its first report \r\non Srebrenica that the United Nations experience in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina was one of the most difficult \r\nand painful in the Organization’s history. The report \r\nfurther noted that Srebrenica clarified the truth the \r\nUnited Nations and the world learned too late: Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina was as much a moral obligation as it \r\nwas a military conflict, and Srebrenica will haunt us \r\nforever. \r\n On 27 February 2007, the International Court of \r\nJustice ruled on the application of the Convention on \r\nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \r\nGenocide in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina versus \r\nSerbia and Montenegro. The International Court of \r\nJustice ruled that genocide was committed against \r\nBosnian Muslims in and around Srebrenica in eastern \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Members will agree, of \r\ncourse, that this was not an isolated case. That is one \r\nmore reason for our determination and commitment, \r\nshared by a majority of the Member States, to the \r\nnecessary reform of the world Organization. \r\n In that light, Bosnia and Herzegovina is of the \r\nopinion that only a strong United Nations can be an \r\nefficient instrument in regulating international \r\nrelations, in accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter and international law. Apart from the necessary \r\nreforms, it is also essential to revitalize the United \r\nNations, including the General Assembly and its \r\ncommittees, the Economic and Social Council, the \r\nSecretariat and other bodies. \r\n That would include defining a number of issues, \r\nsuch as Security Council membership categories, the \r\nnumber of members, selection procedures for new \r\nmembers, veto powers, regional representation, \r\nworking methods, and so on. Those attest to the \r\ncomplexity of the ongoing reform. A productive step \r\nforward will inevitably lead to essential negotiations in \r\nthat context, rather than to the usual ongoing \r\nconsultations. I should like to emphasize Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina’s interest in reform that would create a \r\nlarger Security Council membership, and thus an \r\nadditional seat for the Eastern European Group. \r\n Multi-ethnic and multireligious Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, with its rich historical heritage and \r\nexperience of the failures of the international \r\ncommunity, primarily the United Nations — failures \r\nthat had troubling consequences for my country, but \r\nalso positive results in post-war peacebuilding \r\nalongside United Nations representatives, bodies and \r\nagencies — could contribute greatly to the United \r\nNations becoming an effective instrument in the \r\ncollective management of international relations.  \r\n My country believes that there can be no peace or \r\nstability without economic and social development. My \r\ncountry maintains its support for the Security Council \r\nas a critical body for international cooperation, peace \r\nand the development of the rights of all nations. \r\nHaving met its historic challenges, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina is now able to share its experiences with a \r\ntroubled world. Bosnia and Herzegovina is thus \r\ndetermined to intensify ongoing activities leading to its \r\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council \r\nfrom 2010 to 2012, and looks forward to the support of \r\nthe majority of Member States for that membership. \r\n I come from a post-conflict country that has \r\nmoved towards becoming a modern democratic society \r\nand taken the path to European and trans-Atlantic \r\nintegration. That is why my country is truly committed \r\nto the strengthening of international cooperation on the \r\nregional, European and global levels. \r\n It is with great pride that I can state today that \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is an active participant in all \r\nregional south-eastern European initiatives and \r\nprocesses. In 2007, Bosnia and Herzegovina was \r\nrecognized for its proactive regional stand. The South-\r\nEast European Cooperation Process (SEECP) summit \r\nin Zagreb adopted the decision to make Sarajevo the \r\nregional cooperation council centre. Creating the \r\nregional cooperation council is the final step in the \r\ntransformation of the Stability Pact for South Eastern \r\nEurope, meaning that SEECP member States will \r\nassume regional responsibilities. With that decision, \r\nthe capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina will become a \r\nfuture regional cooperation centre, and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina will also be home to the regional disaster \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n5 07-51711 \r\n \r\npreparedness and prevention initiative secretariat, \r\ntaking strong regional ownership of the Stability Pact \r\nfor South Eastern Europe initiative. The representative \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina will play a lead role in the \r\nregional arms control verification and implementation \r\nassistance centre in Zagreb. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is pursuing active \r\nregional cooperation in fighting organized crime. We \r\ncooperate actively with the Southeast Europe \r\nCooperative Initiative Centre for Combating \r\nTransborder Crime in Bucharest. It was through more \r\nefficient regional cooperation, electronic identity \r\ndatabases and efficient border control that Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina was able to reduce the number of illegal \r\nimmigrants, as well as all forms of cross-border \r\ncriminal activity. \r\n We are developing cooperation with the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna on the \r\ndetection and prevention of radioactive substance \r\ntransportation and proliferation on Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina territory. Bosnia and Herzegovina is \r\nbuilding relationships with neighbouring countries on \r\nthe basis of equality, complete independence, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and its neighbours are aware that \r\ncomplete development can be achieved only by joining \r\na united Europe. That goal will be achieved by \r\npursuing the development of all aspects of good \r\nrelations with neighbouring countries, the \r\ndemocratization of the entire region, and acceptance of \r\ngeneral European standards.  \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina believes in \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign \r\ncountries, and thus that the solution for Kosovo is to be \r\nreached through dialogue among the interested parties. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina supports dialogue between \r\nBelgrade and Pristina and is eager to help find a \r\nsolution acceptable to both sides within regional \r\ninitiatives. Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the efforts \r\nof the Troika Contact Group for Kosovo and hopes that \r\na satisfying solution for the future status of Kosovo \r\nwill be found. A further lengthy delay in the resolution \r\nof the status of Kosovo will certainly have a long-term \r\nnegative impact on the entire Balkan region. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina has also achieved \r\nsignificant successes in the broader international \r\ncontext. In late 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina became \r\na member of the NATO Partnership for Peace. Further \r\nrecognition came in May 2007, when Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina became a member of a rather significant \r\nnew United Nations body — the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n On 31 May 2007, Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nbecame a presiding member of the Hague Code of \r\nConduct, which has been signed by 126 United Nations \r\nMember States. My country and the other signatories \r\nof the Code, who believe in the principle of collective \r\nsafety, are prepared to fight against the proliferation of \r\nballistic missile technology. We are aware of the great \r\ndanger posed by ballistic missiles in the hands of \r\nnon-government entities, which could abuse them for \r\ndestructive purposes anywhere in the world. Therefore, \r\nI urge all countries that have not yet signed the Hague \r\nCode of Conduct — particularly those with ballistic \r\ncapacity — to accept the Code. I also wish to urge all \r\nMember States to support the relevant draft resolution \r\nproposed by my country and Portugal. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina has participated and will \r\ncontinue to participate, to the extent possible, in the \r\ninternational efforts of the anti-terrorism coalition. We \r\nhave also undertaken to join the anti-terrorism efforts \r\nof the European Union. The Council of Ministers of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has approved an anti-\r\nterrorism strategic plan for the period 2006-2009. The \r\nongoing reform of our criminal code will result in \r\nadditional anti-terrorism measures that will conform to \r\nthe relevant international conventions. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina supports other Member \r\nStates in continuing joint efforts to strengthen respect \r\nfor all human rights, including civil, economic, \r\ncultural, political, social, developmental and other \r\nrights. Bosnia and Herzegovina has agreed to serve as a \r\nsponsor of the Italian initiative aimed at a United \r\nNations moratorium on the death penalty, to be \r\nconsidered by the General Assembly. Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina has made significant progress in \r\nsubmitting the relevant reports to the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nin Geneva. \r\n I also wish to note that Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\ntogether with Jordan, has promoted the United Nations \r\nBetter World Campaign for the past few years. The \r\nCampaign seeks to improve the timeliness and \r\neffectiveness of humanitarian disaster response. \r\n Bosnian authorities continue to be committed to \r\ncooperating fully with the International Criminal \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 6 \r\n \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). All \r\nsuspected war criminals from the territories of the \r\nformer Yugoslavia must be brought to justice. To date, \r\nwe have engaged in positive cooperation with the \r\nTribunal on issues such as the processing of criminal \r\ncharges, extradition, contacting the relevant authorities, \r\naccess to documentation and providing appropriate \r\nworking conditions for Court representatives and \r\nothers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n We are creating a legal framework and have \r\nestablished the War Crimes Chamber within the Court \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina to begin processing war \r\ncrimes cases. That is one of the conditions for \r\nestablishing an atmosphere of mutual trust and \r\nreconciliation in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nHowever, the ICTY should not conclude its work until \r\nthe most notorious war criminals — in particular \r\nBosnian Serb war leaders Radovan Karadzic, Ratko \r\nMladic and others — are brought to justice. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina supports all peace \r\ninitiatives and conflict prevention activities. We \r\nsupport and are following very closely the Middle East \r\nRoad Map, which will lead to permanent and \r\nsustainable peace in Middle East. As part of United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina has military observers in the Congo and \r\nEthiopia and has contributed to the civilian police \r\nforces in the Sudan, Cyprus, Liberia and Haiti. Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina has also sent a small demining unit to \r\nIraq in order to help its people establish a democratic \r\nand self-sustainable country. \r\n We are certain that, by strengthening \r\nmultilateralism, the United Nations can develop \r\neffective measures to prevent armed conflict. At the \r\nsame time, however, it is essential to uphold the \r\nprinciple of the political independence, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of all countries, in accordance with \r\nthe guiding principles of international law and with full \r\nrespect for human rights. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the Middle East \r\nRoad Map and the initiatives of the Quartet, which \r\nestablish a basis for the beginning of a true Israeli-\r\nPalestinian dialogue that is brokered by the United \r\nStates and in accordance with European Union \r\nguidelines. Bosnia and Herzegovina calls for a general, \r\nunconditional and mutual cessation of all hostilities, \r\nthe release of all hostages and the launching of \r\nnegotiations on a definitive two-State solution to the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian problem. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina urges all ethnic and \r\nreligious communities in Iraq to put an end to sectarian \r\nviolence and to take an active role in political life. We \r\njoin the rest of the international community in calling \r\nfor a broad national political dialogue, emphasizing \r\nfull compliance with the Geneva Conventions of 1949. \r\n Mindful of the potentially catastrophic \r\nconsequences of a deepening of the crisis related to the \r\nIranian nuclear development programme, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina calls on Iran to be prepared to cooperate \r\nfully with the International Atomic Energy Agency and \r\nto engage in a dialogue with key partners.  \r\n The United Nations role in conflict resolution is \r\ncrucial. However, during various international crises, \r\nparticularly that in the former Yugoslavia, the \r\nOrganization has failed to play the role entrusted to it \r\nby the Charter. The Iraqi crisis highlights the \r\nweaknesses of the United Nations in preventing \r\nconflict throughout the world. If the United Nations \r\nfails to shoulder its Charter responsibilities, that could \r\nlead to a number of unilateral interventions, which \r\nwould have a very negative impact on international \r\nstability. \r\n The foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is \r\nfocused on long-term peacekeeping and development \r\nwith a view to ensuring the safety and stability of \r\noverall development. All our international activities are \r\nbased on and conform to the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and universally \r\naccepted principles of international law. \r\n Aware of the enormous threat to peace posed by \r\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons, particularly \r\nin the hands of terrorists, Bosnia and Herzegovina has \r\ntaken significant steps towards total control in \r\npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. We have ratified or acceded to most of the \r\nmajor documents in this area. Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nis also eager to cooperate fully with other countries at \r\nthe bilateral level through relevant multilateral \r\norganizations and initiatives in order to effectively \r\nfight the proliferation and use of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted a law \r\nproviding for the implementation of the Chemical \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n7 07-51711 \r\n \r\nWeapons Convention. As one of the countries most \r\naffected by the mine stockpiles left over from the \r\nprevious conflict, Bosnia and Herzegovina is paying \r\nclose attention to the implementation of the Ottawa \r\nConvention.  \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is an active participant \r\nin the response and prevention programmes of the Joint \r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. Our \r\ncontributions to the fight against that disease are \r\ndescribed in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Strategy to \r\nPrevent and Combat HIV/AIDS, 2004-2009. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina pays its dues on time \r\nand on a regular basis to the United Nations and all \r\nother organizations of which it is a member. We urge \r\nother countries, especially major contributors, to do \r\nlikewise. I am referring in particular to the dues to the \r\nICTY and peacekeeping operations that have not been \r\npaid in a timely manner. \r\n Two days ago in this Hall, we had a highly \r\nconstructive exchange of views on one of the most \r\nserous and potentially dangerous phenomena of our \r\ntime: global warming. Once again, I should like to \r\nemphasize the crucial importance of effective and \r\ntimely United Nations action on this issue. In 2000, my \r\ncountry ratified the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, which entered into \r\nforce in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 15 June 2007. I \r\nurge all Member States that have not yet done so to \r\nratify the Convention without delay. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chairman of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Željko Komšić, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President \r\nof the Republic of Mozambique \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of \r\nMozambique. \r\n Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Guebuza (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe people and the Government of the Republic of \r\nMozambique and, indeed, on my own behalf, I would \r\nlike to associate myself with the previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating you most warmly on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. We are confident that with your experience \r\nand wise leadership, as demonstrated throughout your \r\nremarkable academic and diplomatic career at the \r\nservice of your country, and with the support of us all, \r\nthe deliberations of this session will be crowned with \r\nsuccess. \r\n Mr. President, my delegation would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor, Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \r\ndedication and the innovative manner with which she \r\npresided over the deliberations of the sixty-first session \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n We also wish to reiterate our special tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his election to this post, and we salute him for his \r\ncommitment to the continued search for solutions to \r\nthe many challenges faced by humanity, and for his \r\nhard work on behalf of our Organization. \r\nMr. Secretary-General, we would like to reaffirm our \r\nfull readiness to continue cooperating with you for the \r\nsuccessful discharge of your difficult but noble \r\nmission. \r\n We commend the selection of the theme of \r\nclimate change as the main discussion topic for this \r\nsession, as it is an urgent and important issue for our \r\ncountries and for the future of our planet. Thanks to the \r\nrevolution in convergence technology in the areas of \r\ninformatics, broadcasting and telecommunications, \r\nwith implications for time and space compression, we \r\nhave been following with emotion and on a regular \r\nbasis, and in some instances in real time, the effects of \r\nclimate change on our planet. We have witnessed the \r\nreduction in the availability of water resources and the \r\ntragic consequences for human beings, fauna and flora; \r\nthe increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme \r\nmeteorological phenomena, such as extreme \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 8 \r\n \r\ntemperatures, earthquakes and tsunamis, resulting in \r\nthe occurrence of natural disasters whose consequences \r\nare incalculable; the reduction of glaciers and the rise \r\nof sea level; to mention but a few of the potential \r\nimpacts of climate change, the full effects of which are \r\nyet to be clearly determined. \r\n The impact of these phenomena is felt more \r\nharshly in developing countries, such as ours, given \r\nour deficient forecasting capacity in terms of human \r\nand technical resources. When these disasters strike \r\nour countries, our limitations and our lack of capacity \r\nto face them become more obvious. Examples of such \r\nlimitations include: a lack of infrastructure, such as \r\nroads and bridges, preventing rescue personnel from \r\nproviding timely assistance, even to citizens at great \r\nrisk; a lack of means to assist the victims; and a lack of \r\nresources to mitigate the suffering of the survivors.  \r\n Given that we live in a global village, the effects \r\nof climate change are also felt in developed countries. \r\nPhenomena never before recorded with the magnitude \r\nand frequency with which they manifest themselves \r\ntoday are beginning to be a cause of concern for the \r\ncitizens of these countries. \r\n To digress a little from the discussion at hand, we \r\nwould like to express our solidarity with and \r\ncompassion to all victims of the natural disasters that \r\nhave affected different regions of the planet in recent \r\nyears. In honour of the victims of these disasters, let us \r\nall reaffirm our commitment to continue together to \r\nstrive for a better world, a world free of these threats to \r\nhuman life and possessions, and to fauna and flora. \r\n That is a collective commitment and aspiration \r\nthat we have already assumed through several \r\ninstruments, such as the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 \r\nand the Kyoto Protocol. More than ever, and in the face \r\nof recurrent and increasingly devastating tragedies, \r\nthere is a need for the involvement of all the members \r\nof the international community in the implementation \r\nof the global actions provided for in these joint \r\nundertakings. \r\n By the same token, we should ensure that the \r\nthree pillars of sustainable development, namely, \r\neconomic development, social development and the \r\nprotection of the environment should be approached \r\nand tackled by all of us, in an integrated, coordinated \r\nand balanced manner. Let us all keep in mind the \r\nstrong relationship between these commitments and \r\nour collective desire to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n We note with great satisfaction that the \r\ninternational community continues to be committed to \r\naddressing, in a structured and sustainable manner, the \r\nchallenges imposed by climate change. In this context, \r\nwe welcome the decisions on climate change taken by \r\nthe Heads of State and Government of Group of Eight \r\n(G-8) at their last summit held in June of this year in \r\nGermany. \r\n We would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for his initiative in appointing three eminent \r\npersons as Special Envoys on Climate Change. The \r\nconvening of the High-level Event on Climate Change, \r\njust two days ago here in this General Assembly Hall, \r\nopens up new prospects for the renewed momentum \r\nnecessary for substantial progress to be made during \r\nthe Conference of States Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Agreement on Climate Change, scheduled \r\nfor December of this year in Bali, Indonesia. \r\n We are hopeful that this Conference will build \r\nconsensus on future actions, including concrete targets \r\naimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and a \r\npost-Kyoto agreement to be binding on all nations. \r\nMay this Conference not frustrate expectations, \r\nparticularly those of the developing countries. \r\n It is our hope that in Bali consensus will be \r\nreached in some key areas. First, we would like to see \r\nthe provision of funding of the national action plans for \r\nadaptation to climate change, proposed by developing \r\ncountries parties to the Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change. The second element is the Adaptation \r\nFund, established in conformity with the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, to provide assistance for developing \r\ncountries, in particular the least developed countries, in \r\nthe funding of their adaptation activities. The third is \r\nthe implementation of the Buenos Aires Programme of \r\nWork on Adaptation and Response Measures. \r\n Mozambique is a country prone to various types \r\nof natural disasters, which cyclically have resulted in \r\nthe loss of human lives, the destruction of huge \r\nagricultural areas, property and social and economic \r\ninfrastructures and increased soil erosion and a \r\ndecrease in or outright loss of biodiversity. \r\n This state of affairs is aggravated by the shortage \r\nof physical infrastructures for water management, such \r\nas dams and dykes, and for food conservation, such as \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n9 07-51711 \r\n \r\nsilos. In addition, over 70 per cent of our population \r\nlives in rural areas, and natural resources are their \r\nprincipal source of livelihood. Hence the need for \r\nsustainable use that does not jeopardize the country’s \r\nenvironmental balance. \r\n Because of this permanent vulnerability, \r\nenvironmental issues in general, and climate change in \r\nparticular, form an integral part of the Government \r\nagenda. Particular attention is thus given to reducing \r\nthe vulnerability of citizens to famine caused by \r\ndrought, reducing human and property losses, \r\nmitigating the suffering of the population as a result of \r\ndisasters and ensuring quick and harmonious \r\nreconstruction processes. \r\n The activities under way include mapping the \r\nareas at risk, improving the early warning system, \r\nimproving the conditions for the population to store \r\nagricultural produce, the provision of training and civic \r\neducation for our citizens on natural disasters and their \r\nimpact on the life of the country and the establishment \r\nof a national emergency operations centre, which \r\noperates 24 hours a day non-stop. \r\n The introduction and implementation of these \r\nmeasures give priority to and rely on the active \r\nparticipation of our citizens. For us, the involvement of \r\nour citizens, who are the primary and ultimate \r\nbeneficiaries of these governmental actions, is a key \r\nfactor in ensuring the success of activities aimed at the \r\npreservation of the environment and mitigating the \r\nadverse effects of climate change. The positive impact \r\nof these actions was in evidence and widely \r\nacknowledged during the recent floods, cyclones and \r\nhigh tides that we experienced earlier this year. These \r\nmeasures were recently put to the test once again, when \r\na warning was sounded on the possibility of a tsunami. \r\n In recognition of the fact that the mitigation of \r\nand adaptation to climate change and the prevention \r\nand reduction of natural disasters require the \r\nengagement of the international community, the \r\nimportance of strengthening regional, continental and \r\ninternational coordination cannot be overemphasized. \r\nIn the framework of the report of the High-level Panel \r\non System-wide Coherence in the areas of \r\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance and the \r\nenvironment (A/61/583), we advocate the \r\nstrengthening of the Global Environment Facility \r\nwithin the United Nations system. We thus encourage \r\nthe United Nations to enhance its institutional capacity \r\nand resources to better assist Member States to \r\nincorporate adequate environmental policies in their \r\nnational development strategies. In this regard, special \r\nattention should be given to developing countries with \r\nlimited resources to fund their national capacity-\r\nbuilding for dealing with issues related to climate \r\nchange. \r\n From this rostrum we once again call upon all \r\nUnited Nations Member States to accede to and fully \r\nimplement all the instruments that have been adopted \r\nto revert and mitigate the impact of climate change. \r\nThese instruments include the Kyoto Protocol, Agenda \r\n21 and the Rio Declaration, whose contents were \r\nreaffirmed at the World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, held in Johannesburg in 2002. \r\n As members of the United Nations family, we \r\nhave the historic responsibility of securing a bright \r\nfuture for our children and for the generations to come \r\nby preserving a quality environment. That is why \r\ntoday, more than ever, the time has come for us to join \r\nour hands and work to preserve our planet. To act \r\nagainst climate change is, in the last analysis, to \r\npreserve world peace and security and to ensure \r\nnecessary conditions to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which should be viewed and \r\nassumed as the minimum that can now be demanded. \r\nIndeed, let us not postpone until tomorrow what we \r\ncan, and must, all do today, as tomorrow may be too \r\nlate. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Mr. Kariyawasam (Sri Lanka), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCyprus. \r\n Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 10 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Papadopoulos: Before I begin, I wish \r\nto indicate that my statement is complementary to that \r\ndelivered yesterday (see A/62/PV.4) by the Prime \r\nMinister of Portugal on behalf of the European Union, \r\nto which Cyprus fully subscribes. \r\n As this is the first general debate since the \r\nelection of the new Secretary-General, I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon \r\non his appointment to that crucial post and wish him \r\nevery success. His report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/62/1) demonstrates not only the broad \r\nspectrum of issues dealt with by the United Nations but \r\nalso the comprehensive character and vast potential of \r\nmultilateral diplomacy. Among the aspects of the \r\nOrganization’s work that are of particular interest, we \r\nnote the disconcerting developments in the Middle \r\nEast, the modest progress made with respect to the \r\ndevelopment agenda, the effects of the Organization’s \r\ninvolvement in different crises, particularly in Africa, \r\nand the increasing impact of its humanitarian \r\ncontribution. \r\n To date, we have ample scientific data and other \r\noverwhelmingly convincing evidence suggesting that \r\nworld climate is changing to the detriment of human \r\nand ecological systems as a result of human activity. \r\nThus, our response to this alarming phenomenon \r\nshould be the focus of our debate rather than the extent \r\nto which it exists. \r\n We believe that it is important for us to define, \r\nfrom the outset, the scope of the response we are \r\nseeking to formulate. In the face of the quasi-\r\nirreversibility of the damage done thus far, we should \r\nat least put the necessary focus, resources and energy \r\ninto curbing the galloping deterioration of the situation \r\nand urgently decide the first steps to protect our \r\nsocieties from large-scale future climate change. \r\n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \r\nhas suggested a number of technological and policy \r\ninstruments that are available to Governments for \r\nmitigation action. We stand ready to support the \r\nadoption of a number of sectoral policies and measures \r\nthat the Panel has deemed effective, such as the use of \r\nrenewable energy, the use of technology to produce \r\nenergy cleanly, improved waste and waste-water \r\nmanagement and the use of alternative technologies in \r\nexploiting human systems like forestry, fisheries and \r\nagriculture. \r\n In deciding and enforcing our response, we see \r\nno plausible framework other than the United Nations. \r\nAside from its unique position to address the issue \r\nbecause of its global character, its success in \r\nconfronting a threat with such massive potential as \r\nclimate change will be a litmus test for the relevance of \r\nour Organization. One could say that climate change is \r\nthe modern-day equivalent of the security threat that \r\nnecessitated the establishment of the Organization in \r\n1945. It remains to be seen whether our system can be \r\nas effective in dealing with contemporary threats to \r\nhumanity as it has been in dealing with more \r\ntraditional security deficits. \r\n Let me now turn to an issue with which the \r\nUnited Nations has had a long involvement, an issue \r\nwhich we aim to keep as one of the Organization’s \r\npriorities until it has been definitively resolved within \r\nthe framework set out in the numerous relevant \r\nresolutions of this Organization. \r\n For many years, the United Nations has engaged \r\nin strenuous efforts aimed at brokering a solution. It \r\nmay be that the task has proved so very arduous, \r\nbecause the Cyprus issue, when stripped of the niceties \r\nof diplomatic terminology, is a question of foreign \r\naggression and continuing occupation of a significant \r\npart of a sovereign State, entailing enclaved and \r\nmissing persons, refugees and massive and enduring \r\nviolations of human rights. \r\n Cyprus has survived the most difficult \r\ncircumstances created by the many facets of the \r\nproblem and has primarily insisted on one thing vis-à-\r\nvis the involvement of the United Nations in its \r\nresolution: the full application of the values on which \r\nthis Organization was founded and which it has worked \r\nso hard to promote. \r\n So, why does this problem persist after so many \r\nyears during which the national, regional and \r\ninternational political landscape has undergone \r\ndramatic changes? Certainly, it is neither for lack of \r\npolitical will nor for lack of effort on our part. Rather, \r\nthe occupying Power has not displayed any motivation \r\nto solve the problem, and this has only been reinforced \r\nby the Annan plan, which satisfied all Turkish \r\ndesiderata, thus being readily accepted by the Turkish \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n11 07-51711 \r\n \r\nside. Instead, Turkey has used its dominant position to \r\ncommand trade-offs of all sorts. \r\n Secondly, Turkey’s long-standing objective of \r\ngaining political and military control over Cyprus \r\nremains unchanged. Despite declaratory remarks of \r\nwillingness to solve the Cyprus problem, its actions \r\nconfirm its dedication to its ab initio pursuit of \r\ncontrolling Cyprus by partitioning it geographically \r\ninto two ethnically clean parts, with Turkey securing \r\nrights of suzerainty and the “right” of intervention in \r\nCyprus. \r\n Thirdly, efforts to solve the Cyprus problem have \r\nnot been filtered through a system of values and norms \r\nof international law. They have not been tailored to \r\ntackling the roots of the problem or even to the \r\nproblem itself; rather, their centre of gravity seems to \r\nhave been the kind of solution the occupying Power \r\nwould want or could, at least, tolerate. In fact, it is \r\nclear through the conduct and negotiating positions of \r\nTurkey that it has not contemplated a solution outside \r\nthe boundaries of the status quo. \r\n Fourthly, shifting the problem from the context of \r\nits origin — that of invasion and occupation — has led \r\nto a problem-solving methodology that divides the \r\ndistance that separates the parties, caving in to the \r\ndemands of the more powerful party and making \r\nsuccess conditional upon the other’s magnanimity. \r\n Fifthly, the occupying Power has insisted on \r\ndiscussing elements that form neither part of the \r\ngenesis of the problem nor part of its solution. The \r\nCyprus problem is caused by not bad community \r\nrelations but by outside intervention. Persisting, \r\ntherefore, with a constitutional arrangement, set up \r\nprimarily on the basis of ethnic origin — without due \r\nrespect for the overriding democratic principles of \r\nliberty and equality of all citizens — insults the dignity \r\nof those citizens and dooms the viability of any \r\nsettlement. \r\n We currently find ourselves engaged in an effort \r\nto implement a process consisting of an Agreement \r\nconcluded and signed by the two communities in \r\nCyprus on 8 July 2006 and complemented by letters \r\nexchanged between the leaders of the two communities \r\nand the then Under-Secretary-General for Political \r\nAffairs of the United Nations, Mr. Gambari, on \r\n15 November 2006. The surprising laboriousness in the \r\nimplementation of this carefully crafted Agreement — \r\nthe purpose of which is to prepare the ground for \r\nsubsequent negotiation and to lead to a comprehensive \r\nsettlement of the Cyprus issue — is not inherent to this \r\nparticular process. We should therefore concentrate on \r\nimplementing what has been agreed. The pace can only \r\nbe determined by progress, with full-fledged \r\nnegotiations as needed. Sidelining or circumventing \r\nstages of the process will lead, not to expediting the \r\nsolution, but to confirming the deadlock. \r\n So, what does the future hold for the mission of \r\ngood offices entrusted to the Secretary-General by the \r\nSecurity Council? For our part, we remain fully \r\ncommitted, as it is clear to us that we cannot sustain \r\nthe status quo and must insist on a meaningful and \r\nforward-looking process that can elicit concrete results, \r\nleading to the establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal \r\nfederation, within the true meaning of each of these \r\nterms. The only process that can take us forward is the \r\none established by the 8 July agreed process I have just \r\noutlined. This process is expected to test suggestions, \r\nideas and alternatives at the expert level, adequately \r\nprepare the ground and submit to the leaders, any \r\npoints that warrant political compromise or agreement. \r\nAlthough the last meeting with the Turkish Cypriot \r\nleader did not signal the beginning of the \r\nimplementation of the Agreement as we had hoped, we \r\nwill not rescind our efforts to put the 8 July process \r\nback on track. The element of time is very important; \r\nhowever, only progress through preparing the ground \r\ncan bring us sooner to an agreed settlement. With a \r\nview to achieving progress, I submitted to the \r\nSecretary-General certain ideas and proposals that I \r\nhope will contribute to this end.  \r\n Turkey’s intentions are not only manifest in the \r\nnon-resolution of the Cyprus problem after all these \r\nyears. They transpire from all its actions: the \r\nnon-normalization of its relations with Cyprus as a first \r\nstep to becoming a European partner, the non-removal \r\nof any of its troops from Cypriot soil as a confidence-\r\nbuilding measure, the intensification of efforts to \r\nproject a secessionist entity in Cyprus and its \r\nsystematic violations of our sovereign air and maritime \r\nspace and of the military status quo. This was recently \r\nconfirmed by explicit statements of its leadership at the \r\nhighest political level referring to “a settlement based \r\non two peoples, two democracies, two States and two \r\nreligions”. That is an arrangement we shall never \r\naccept. \r\n Over the past year, we have also witnessed \r\nrepeated attempts by the occupying Power to illegally \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 12 \r\n \r\nexplore my country’s natural resources and to sabotage \r\nour sovereign right to explore and manage these \r\nresources. It has carried out unauthorized demolitions \r\nof Greek Cypriot houses in the areas it occupies and it \r\ncontinues to destroy cultural and religious heritage. It \r\nhas intensified the large-scale illegal exploitation of \r\nGreek Cypriot properties in the occupied part of \r\nCyprus, not least because this will skew the terms of a \r\nfuture settlement. \r\n At the same time, Turkey pursues its own \r\nstrategic objectives in Cyprus at the expense of \r\nreunification and is only guided by its own interests \r\nand not those of Turkish Cypriots. It has ascertained \r\nover the years that the occupied part of Cyprus would \r\ncome completely under its political, economic and \r\nmilitary control. We regret to note that Turkey has been \r\ntrying to involve our friends and neighbours in this ill-\r\nconceived effort. Underpinning this strategy is the \r\nintent to legitimize the fait accompli of the invasion \r\nand attribute political status to its results. Such a \r\nstrategy could not have been achieved without \r\npresenting the Turkish Cypriot community as victims, \r\nnot of Turkish aggression as really is the case, but of \r\nGreek Cypriots for resisting this fait accompli. A prime \r\nexample of those tactics has been the ongoing \r\ncampaign to deceivingly suggest that the Turkish \r\nCypriot community is economically disadvantaged \r\nbecause it is isolated. Considering that the per capita \r\nincome of Turkish Cypriots has doubled over the past \r\nthree years and that they now enjoy the 59th highest \r\nper capita income in the world, one can easily detect \r\nthe political agenda behind the attempt to link their \r\neconomic development with the fate of the illegal \r\nregime. \r\n For years now, we have been advocating that the \r\nroad to solving the Cyprus problem is not via the \r\nexclusion of the inconvenient truths that underlie it or \r\nthe bypassing of principles that are, for us, the \r\nguarantee that the settlement of the Cyprus problem \r\nwill continue to be valid and relevant in a constantly \r\nchanging world. \r\n Equally important, we regard the preservation of \r\nour interests and those of Turkey in our region not as \r\nmutually exclusive but as complementary and \r\ninterdependent. Our vision must be to bequeath to \r\nfuture generations the legacy of friendship, cooperation \r\nand good neighbourliness. We are afforded the \r\nopportunity to avoid eternalizing this feud and we \r\nshould seize it. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of \r\nthe Republic of Madagascar \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar. \r\n Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Madagascar, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ravalomanana: Each and every one \r\nof us knows that there is an urgent need for the \r\nglobalization of responsibility. Each of us knows that \r\nthis responsibility demands more than just goodwill. \r\nEach of us knows that the globalization of \r\nresponsibility demands the creation of the right \r\nenvironment to reach these objectives. Every year, \r\nthese objectives and measures are repeated at this \r\nGeneral Assembly. Every year, the actions to fulfil \r\nthem remain weak. \r\n This is the fifth time I have taken part in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and I must honestly tell you that I \r\nam very concerned about two things. First, I am very \r\nconcerned because national interests prevail over \r\nemergencies that affect us all. These emergencies are \r\nclosely linked to common interests. It is in the interest \r\nof all of us to address them together. Second, I am very \r\nconcerned about the lack of seriousness. A lot of \r\npromises are made, but not a lot of promises are kept. \r\n Today, we are confronted with two major \r\nchallenges that could entail major disasters should we \r\nnot take them seriously and act quickly. Those \r\nchallenges must be the priority of priorities. The first \r\nconcerns climate change. The second is the \r\ndevelopment of Africa.  \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n13 07-51711 \r\n \r\n Imagine the impact on all the nations and all the \r\npeople represented here if the situation worsens. All of \r\nour national efforts will be ruined by earthquakes, \r\necological disasters and social disasters. Climate \r\nchange creates and aggravates conflicts. The refugees \r\nand victims of climate change will be the refugees and \r\nvictims of wars and poverty. We must act today to save \r\nthe earth, or this earth will not be ours anymore. \r\n On the other hand, imagine the impact on all \r\nnations and all people if the current situation improves. \r\nIt will strengthen the confidence of nations and \r\ninvestors. If the world were in ecological balance, and \r\nif it were without poverty, there would be a \r\nconsiderable impact on political and social conflicts. \r\n The two challenges are bound together. Africa \r\nwill have either a positive or a negative impact on the \r\nworld climate, with enormous repercussions. Our \r\nactions and our decisions will decide. The world \r\nclimate will have either a positive or a negative impact, \r\nwith enormous repercussions for the development of \r\nAfrica. Again, our decisions and our actions will \r\ndecide. \r\n Africa only produces one per cent of the world’s \r\nsolar energy. In Africa, the possibilities for new and \r\nclean forms of energy and for the reduction of carbon \r\ndioxide are enormous. \r\n Madagascar could provide some of its energy \r\nneeds through the development of hydropower. \r\nAdditionally, half of the island could be reforested. Our \r\nisland, called the Red Island, could once again become \r\nknown as the Green Island. \r\n There is a strong link between the quality of the \r\nenvironment and poverty. Many bushfires are the result \r\nof poverty; the destruction of natural resources \r\nincreases poverty. It is necessary to quickly step out of \r\nthis vicious cycle. Increased international help will \r\nlimit the exploitation of natural resources by poor \r\nfarmers. \r\n In Madagascar, we have been planning our \r\ndevelopment strategies around the concept of \r\nsustainability for some time now. Our vision is called \r\n“Madagascar, Naturally!” It means that our natural \r\nresources and our people are our wealth. We will \r\npreserve our environment and increase its value by \r\nusing it responsibly. \r\n We are actively looking for international \r\ninvestment, but believe that in the long run this will not \r\namount to much unless we have domestic investors as \r\nwell. We can create added value through our successes \r\nin processing our natural products. \r\n We are convinced that economic growth from the \r\nbottom up is the key to success. The most important \r\nmessage I gave to the Malagasy people at the \r\nbeginning of my second term was the necessity of \r\ndecentralization right down to the level of the \r\nfokontany. Originally, the fokontany was the traditional \r\nMalagasy village. We are trying our best to restore the \r\nbalance between humans and nature. \r\n This is a different approach; this is a Malagasy \r\napproach; this is an approach that encourages the \r\nMalagasy people to take their future into their own \r\nhands; this is not the approach of the donors. With this \r\napproach we strive to forge a partnership with the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n We have described all of this in detail in the \r\nMadagascar Action Plan. Read it, and you will see that \r\nwe are already contributing to meeting the challenges \r\nthat I have mentioned. We are committing ourselves to \r\nprotecting and cherishing the environment, to healing \r\nthe injuries of the past and to ending rampant climate \r\nchange.  \r\n In the Action Plan we came up with a set of very \r\nambitious goals. We do what we can, despite our \r\nlimited resources; we could do so much more if the \r\ninternational community helped us more. \r\n We are thankful to the donors who have increased \r\ntheir financial assistance; however, as a whole, these \r\nefforts have fallen far short of our expectations, \r\nespecially if we are to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The amount of financial \r\nassistance is not even close to the promise of doubled \r\naid to Africa. The donors are still far from honouring \r\nthe numerous promises made here at the United \r\nNations. They are far from addressing global \r\nchallenges. The international approach to Africa lacks \r\nseriousness. \r\n Aid to Africa is still not a success story for many \r\nmembers of the international community. On average, \r\nresults are poor, but Africa is advancing as a continent — \r\nnot everywhere, but in an increasing number of \r\ncountries. \r\n Once, Madagascar rated amongst the least \r\neffective countries. Today, we are an effective country. \r\nOur economy has benefited from continuous economic \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 14 \r\n \r\ngrowth: we had 5 per cent economic growth 5 years \r\nago, 6 per cent over the last few years and 7 per cent in \r\n2007. Poverty rates are dropping dramatically; in 2002, \r\n80 per cent of our population lived in poverty and last \r\nyear this rate stood at 67 per cent. \r\n Aid to Africa is as weak as ever. Africa can \r\nabsorb so much more and all countries would benefit \r\nfrom this. The European Union is a good example of a \r\nlot of aid leading to great benefits for many countries. I \r\nam convinced that Africa could advance much quicker \r\nif the international community and the African \r\ncountries could come up with a new plan.  \r\n A “Marshall Plan” for Africa — I have suggested \r\nthis repeatedly over the years and I am saying it again: \r\nWe need a “Marshall Plan” for Africa. A crucial \r\nelement to this plan should be a new partnership. I \r\npropose to you an ecological partnership between the \r\nindustrialized countries and Africa. Such a partnership \r\ncould contribute substantially to finding real solutions \r\nto some of the climate problems through a programme \r\nof investment. Other important features would include \r\nnature conservation and the preservation of our \r\nbiodiversity. \r\n I am convinced that Africa could supply clean \r\nenergy, medicinal and industrial plants and other \r\nnatural products in the future. The world will \r\neventually need more and more of these. \r\n We feel that sustainable policies that emphasize \r\nprotection and added value should be high on our \r\nagenda, and should represent our commitment to the \r\nworld. Remember though that such policies will also \r\nbenefit our country. \r\n In Madagascar, cyclones destroy a large part of \r\nour harvests every year; they destroy houses; they kill \r\npeople. The increase in the number and strength of \r\nthose cyclones is hindering the whole process of \r\ndevelopment. Higher temperatures are reducing \r\nharvests and our unique biodiversity. They also lead to \r\nmore and more harmful inserts and illnesses.  \r\n All over Africa, we are already seeing the \r\nconsequences of climate change. Droughts and floods \r\nare the causes of increased migration and serious \r\nconflicts. An aggravation of climate change will not \r\nonly bring fluxes of devastating waters on all \r\ncontinents, but also fluxes of refugees and waves of \r\nsocial conflicts. \r\n In short, the world needs Africa to solve the \r\nproblem of climate change, and Africa needs a stable \r\nclimate for lasting, sustainable development. To \r\nachieve this globalization of responsibility will require \r\ndedicated leadership. We need leaders who can \r\nmobilize their people and get results — fast results and \r\nbig results. \r\n At this time I want to congratulate the new \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I wish him the best of \r\nsuccess in this very important task. We in Africa look \r\nto the United Nations for dynamic leadership — it is \r\nour hope. May his leadership help us to get results — \r\nthe kind of results that bring peace and prosperity to \r\nAfrica and to the world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Umaru Yar’Adua, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria.  \r\n  Mr. Umaru Yar’Adua, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Umaru Yar’Adua, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Yar’Adua: I stand before the \r\nAssembly for the first time as President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, and I wish to reaffirm Nigeria’s \r\ncomplete dedication and commitment to the ideals of \r\nthe United Nations. We declare our total support for the \r\nOrganization’s efforts to meet the multiple \r\nhumanitarian, social, peace and security and \r\ndevelopment challenges confronting our world today.  \r\n At the outset, may I, on behalf of the Government \r\nand the People of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, \r\ncongratulate Mr. Kerim and his country, the Republic \r\nof Macedonia, on his election as President of the \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n15 07-51711 \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure \r\nhim of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian \r\ndelegation as he leads the deliberations of the session.  \r\n I also wish to extend my profound appreciation to \r\nhis predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al \r\nKhalifa, for the commitment and dedication with which \r\nshe presided over the affairs of the sixty-first session. \r\n I formally extend my sincere congratulations to \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his assumption of office as \r\nSecretary-General. I commend him for his resolute \r\nleadership and his determination to carry through the \r\nrequisite reform of the United Nations system and \r\nassure him of the full support of the Nigerian \r\nGovernment.  \r\n I also pay tribute to the previous Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the commitment, \r\ndiligence and courage with which he piloted the affairs \r\nof the United Nations during the past 10 years. We are \r\nproud of the enormous contributions made to this \r\nOrganization by that illustrious son of Africa.  \r\n Since coming into office, my Administration has \r\nanchored its pursuit of a re-energized, stable and \r\nprosperous Nigeria on the fundamental principles of \r\ndemocracy, good governance, free enterprise and the \r\nrule of law. Those are worthy principles which Nigeria \r\nshares with the United Nations family.  \r\n As a main theme of this session’s general debate, \r\n“Responding to climate change” is most appropriate. \r\nthe African continent is particularly vulnerable to the \r\nimpact of climate change. In our collective \r\ndetermination to meet this challenge, African leaders at \r\nthe Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the \r\nAfrican Union (AU), which met in Addis Ababa last \r\nJanuary, decided to integrate climate change issues into \r\nall sustainable development initiatives at the national \r\nand regional levels.  \r\n Nigeria reiterates its commitment to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nWhile applauding the successful outcome of the high-\r\nlevel event on climate change that was held here two \r\ndays ago, on 24 September, we affirm that much more \r\nneeds to be done.  \r\n It has been seven years since world leaders met in \r\nthis Hall for the Millennium Assembly and committed \r\nthemselves to ridding Africa of its most pressing \r\nsocioeconomic and political challenges in order to \r\nallow the continent move with the rest of the world. \r\nWhile tangible progress has been made in a few areas, \r\nthe continent is still bedevilled by great challenges.  \r\n The continued festering of the Darfur crisis \r\nremains a blight on the collective conscience of the \r\ninternational community, one which the Assembly \r\nneeds to address with the utmost urgency. The \r\nhumanitarian crisis has reached a critical level. The \r\nAbuja Peace Agreement, which Nigeria helped to \r\nfacilitate, remains the reference point for a \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the crisis. However, the \r\nlack of full implementation of the Agreement raises \r\nserious cause for concern, and we call on all parties to \r\nrespect their commitments and help drive the peace \r\nprocess forward. We continue to support the process \r\nand reaffirm our support for the African Union — \r\nUnited Nations hybrid force in the Sudan.  \r\n It is imperative that the concerted fight against \r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria, tuberculosis and \r\nrelated diseases not lose momentum. At the national \r\nlevel, we in Nigeria have consistently taken concrete \r\nmeasures to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and to \r\nincrease funding for the National Action Committee on \r\nAIDS. We appreciate the financial and material \r\nassistance from our development partners in this \r\nregard, but our continent cries out for even more \r\nintensified collective efforts at ridding Africa of this \r\nand other pandemics.  \r\n Two years ago, we appraised our performance \r\nagainst the set targets of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and realized that unless concrete and \r\nmore determined actions were taken, the overarching \r\naim of meeting the 2015 targets of poverty eradication \r\nwould remain a fantasy. We recognize that the primary \r\nresponsibility for social and economic development \r\nrests mostly with individual States. Within the ambit of \r\nthe African Union’s New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, the nations of Africa are practically \r\nfacing up to the continent’s economic and \r\nsociopolitical development challenges through the \r\nadoption and engendering of a new political culture \r\nthat will be conducive to long-term development.  \r\n Through such initiatives as the African Union’s \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism, our programme of \r\nself-monitoring and self-assessment, as well as the \r\ninstitutionalization of the ideals of democracy and \r\ngood governance, Africa has clearly defined an assured \r\ncourse to economic regeneration and political stability. \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 16 \r\n \r\n What Africa seeks from the international \r\ncommunity is genuine partnership for economic \r\ndevelopment. This should be manifested in a global \r\neconomic system predicated on fairness, justice and \r\nequity, one that ensures fair trade terms and recognizes \r\nthe centrality of mutuality in prosperity. More \r\nspecifically, Africa requires massive and focused \r\nforeign investment in the development of critical \r\ninfrastructure across the continent. \r\n Let me say that we in Nigeria are wholly \r\ncommitted to the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) in the fight \r\nagainst international terrorism. As a follow-up to that \r\ncommitment, Nigeria has established four counter-\r\nterrorism centres in the country, in addition to the \r\nNigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, which, together \r\nwith the Central Bank of Nigeria, monitors banking \r\ntransactions as part of the mechanism to locate and \r\nterminate the illegal transfer of funds for terrorist and \r\nother criminal acts, including money laundering. \r\nNigeria reiterates its condemnation of all acts of \r\nterrorism and calls upon the international community \r\nto muster the political will necessary to confront and \r\ncheck this menace. \r\n Nigeria affirms its abiding faith in the ideals and \r\nobjectives of the United Nations. We believe that a \r\nstrengthened and restructured United Nations would be \r\nbest placed to address the complex challenges facing \r\nour world today. In that regard, my delegation will \r\ncontinue to collaborate with other Member States to \r\npress for comprehensive reform of the United Nations \r\nsystem, including the much-desired expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories in order to reflect the realities of \r\ntoday’s world. The situation whereby Africa is totally \r\nexcluded from permanent membership of the Council \r\nis unfair and untenable and must be rectified. \r\n The challenges that confront our world today call \r\nfor renewed purpose, renewed resolve, renewed \r\ncourage and renewed respect for human dignity. \r\nPosterity beckons us to a real test of our sense of duty. \r\nWe cannot afford to fail that test. I assure the Assembly \r\nthat Nigeria will continue to support the United \r\nNations in our collective aspirations for a safer, fairer, \r\nmore just and more prosperous world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Umaru Yar’Adua, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President  \r\nof Georgia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Georgia. \r\n Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, \r\nPresident of Georgia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Saakashvili: I am grateful for the \r\nopportunity today to address this sixty-second annual \r\ngathering of the General Assembly. \r\n On behalf of my nation, I would like to \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his innovative \r\nleadership and on the exceptional progress he has made \r\nin his first nine months. His steadfast vision for peace \r\nin Darfur, his commitment to rallying the world to \r\ncombat climate change and his determination to \r\neradicate global poverty stand true to the founding \r\nprinciples of this institution. \r\n Let me also extend my congratulations to \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim on his assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly and express our appreciation \r\nto his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \r\nfor her very effective leadership. \r\n Today, in this great Hall, we have an opportunity \r\nto reaffirm one of the core principles of the United \r\nNations — the right of every individual to pursue a life \r\nof liberty in dignity — by voicing our support for \r\nhundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters, monks \r\nand ordinary citizens, daring to seek freedom for the \r\npeople of Myanmar. We must stand fast with them. It is \r\nmy deepest hope that we will look back and remember \r\nthis saffron revolution of the Burmese monks as \r\nanother step in the inevitable march of liberty across \r\nthe planet. It echoes the rose and orange revolutions \r\nthat freed the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine from \r\nhopelessness and stagnation just a few years ago. \r\n When we returned Georgia to its rightful path of \r\npeace, democracy and transparency, we did so in the \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n17 07-51711 \r\n \r\nknowledge that our country was not an island. We \r\nknew that, in order for our freedom to endure, we \r\nwould have to help advance the peaceful aspirations of \r\nothers around the world, as a responsible member of \r\nthe international community of democratic nations. \r\nThat is why Georgia has lent its sons and daughters to \r\npeacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. \r\nAnd just this month, we committed a new battalion to \r\nserve under French command in Kabul. \r\n This is why we have reached out to our \r\nneighbours in Europe, Central Asia and beyond to \r\npromote peace through cooperation, trade and deeper \r\nengagement. Together, we are working to help ensure \r\nnew and diverse supplies of energy for European and \r\nglobal markets. We contribute to the integrated effort \r\nby building new roads, railways and pipelines that \r\nweave together the countries of our region, ensuring \r\nthat people and goods flow across our borders in a \r\nmanner that is safe, legal, predictable and fair. In short, \r\nour vision for the region is guided by the belief that \r\nmutual interdependence brings mutual benefit. \r\n I believe that the people of Georgia have served \r\nas a catalyst and a living example of how governing \r\ntransparently, through democratic principles, breeds \r\nlasting stability and shared prosperity. This is not, of \r\ncourse, a new path for Georgia, but rather a return to \r\nour European home and our European vocation, so \r\ndeeply enshrined in our national identity and history. \r\n And, while our most challenging relationship \r\ntoday remains with our neighbours in the Russian \r\nFederation, my Government is committed to addressing \r\nthis subject through diplomatic means, in partnership \r\nwith the international community. I can say this with \r\nconfidence, because Georgia is a nation that is rooted \r\nin justice, the rule of law and democracy. This is an \r\nirreversible choice made by the people of my country. \r\nFor evidence of that, one merely has to look at how \r\nGeorgia has responded to the many provocations it has \r\nfaced in the past year, which range from missile attacks \r\nto full-scale embargoes and even destructive pogroms. \r\nRather than lash out angrily, we have redoubled our \r\ncommitment to democratic development and \r\ncomprehensive reform. My Government and I have \r\ndone everything we can to show how much can be \r\nachieved when good governance opens the door to the \r\ndevelopment of human potential. \r\n Today Georgia’s economy is growing at over 14 \r\nper cent. Our gross domestic product per capita has \r\nmore than doubled in four years.  Corruption is the \r\nlowest among transition economies around the world \r\nand one of the lowest in Europe, according to the \r\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \r\nAnd as of today, our country has taken its place \r\nalongside some of the most developed economies in \r\nthe world like Australia, New Zealand, the United \r\nKingdom, Singapore and Hong Kong, Iceland, when \r\nthe World Bank and the International Financial \r\nCorporation ranked Georgia as the 18th easiest and \r\nbest place to do business because of institutionalized \r\ntransparency and a lack of corruption. \r\n We were 140th in world — one of the worst \r\nrankings — and now we have one of the best rankings \r\nfor business and in terms of economic development \r\nand economic conditions. That is proof of what can be \r\nachieved when institutions function and when rhetoric \r\nis replaced with results. \r\n Four years ago, I spoke at this Assembly about \r\nGeorgia being a test case for the modern challenges of \r\ndemocratic transition. Today, it is clear that Georgia’s \r\ntransition has led to real transformation. I could recite \r\na long list of other successes since the Rose Revolution \r\nand, equally, I could elaborate upon the many profound \r\nchallenges that remain. But let me focus on what is \r\nperhaps our most important duty — the imperative to \r\ncreate a better future for the next generation. \r\n We will not rest until every school in Georgia is \r\nfilled with empowered and confident students, who \r\nhave the benefit of new books, a modern curriculum, \r\nfull Internet access, many computers — until every \r\nstudent gets a computer — and motivated teachers. Just \r\nfour years ago our schools were barren and \r\ndesperate — many lacked desks, windows, heat and, \r\nabove all, hope. \r\n Today, reforms in education are sowing the seeds \r\nof lasting prosperity, and our students are leading the \r\nway. That is the Georgia we promised. And that is the \r\nGeorgia we have created. It is also the Georgia we will \r\nand we must defend.  \r\n For our democratic project is not yet complete — \r\nfar from it. Georgia today is not whole. The vast \r\nmajority of residents from the regions of Abkhazia and \r\nSouth Ossetia have been unable to reap the benefits of \r\nthe Rose Revolution that I have just shared with you.  \r\n Tens of thousands of children in these regions are \r\nraised amidst the sounds of gunfire instead of \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 18 \r\n \r\nfireworks. Their homes are not their own, and their \r\ndreams are distant and frightening. They are prisoners \r\nof the morally repugnant politics of ethnic cleansing, \r\ndivision, violence and indifference. \r\n But we will not rest until justice is restored, until \r\nthe rule of law is accessible to everybody. \r\n Today, I regret to say that signs of hope are few \r\nand far between. The story of Abkhazia, where up to \r\n500,000 men, women, and children were forced to flee \r\nin the 1990s, is of particular relevance — one of the \r\nmore abhorrent, horrible and yet forgotten ethnic \r\ncleansings of the twentieth century. In the time since \r\nRussian peacekeepers were deployed there, more than \r\n2,000 Georgians have perished and a climate of fear \r\nhas persisted. \r\n It is worth pausing to remember that today’s \r\nAbkhazia is populated by less than 20 per cent of its \r\npre-war population. It is an area with very fertile land, \r\nbeautiful beaches, lovely resort areas and wonderful \r\nlandscapes. Yet it is all deserted, houses have been \r\ndestroyed, and signs of hopelessness, desperation and \r\nannihilation abound. \r\n The brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing uprooted \r\nethnic Georgians, Armenians, Estonians, Greeks, Jews, \r\nRussians and others who had lived peacefully in that \r\nland for centuries, creating a depopulated and \r\ncriminalized wasteland.  \r\n President Ilves of Estonia spoke today of the \r\nparallels between Darfur and Abkhazia. Of course, we \r\nshould remember Darfur, but we should not forget \r\nAbkhazia. President Ilves knows of what he speaks \r\nbecause tens of thousands of ethnic Estonians were \r\nalso deported and their houses confiscated. In 1992, the \r\nEstonian Government had to evacuate some of these \r\npeople by air under the fire of the people that were \r\nattacking this peaceful middle-class population in \r\nAbkhazia. \r\n The United Nations has tried to bring peace to \r\nthis region, but it has not succeeded in making Georgia \r\nwhole again, despite its unwavering recognition of \r\nGeorgian sovereignty. Every day that passes without a \r\npeaceful resolution to the conflict, every day in which \r\nforcibly displaced persons are not allowed to return \r\nhome, marks a slow erosion of the credibility of this \r\nHouse and of its ability to fulfil its mission. We cannot \r\nallow this situation to continue. \r\n Fourteen years have passed without a single in-\r\ndepth analysis being carried out as to why peace has \r\nnot triumphed or why the legal framework has not been \r\nrestored and has therefore failed. For this reason and in \r\norder to inject a new and positive dynamic into the \r\nprocess, I am calling on the United Nations today to \r\nlaunch a comprehensive review of all aspects of the \r\nGeorgian peace process. The necessity of this review of \r\nthe peace process is self-evident, and it must result in \r\nfundamental changes. \r\n Changes are necessary in the negotiation format, \r\nwhich has stalled, and is stagnant and \r\ncounterproductive. That in turn must lead to real \r\nchanges in operations on the ground. Years of biased \r\nand unbalanced actions by supposed peacekeeping \r\nforces must be replaced with competent and neutral \r\nones that will be engaged in peacebuilding and \r\npeacemaking, rather than in trying to maintain the so-\r\ncalled status quo, while in fact being biased and \r\npreserving the injustices that have happened there. \r\n That is the only path forward. Out of this process, \r\nwe can expect genuine and relevant changes in the \r\nlegal framework. Although we need effective economic \r\nrehabilitation, the main thing we need is a meaningful \r\nand implementable plan to bring about the return of \r\ndisplaced persons, guaranteeing their property rights, \r\nthe establishment of lasting security and the \r\nresumption of direct dialogue on the ground without \r\nany preconditions and without any adverse movements \r\nfrom sides that are against dialogue. \r\n Because of the lack of political will, countless \r\nlives in that part of Georgia are being wasted. And \r\ninaction has its costs. \r\n One of the greatest voices for peace in the last \r\ncentury, Martin Luther King, captured the essence of \r\nthe problem when he said: \r\n “Man’s inhumanity to man is not only perpetrated \r\nby the vitriolic actions of those who are bad. It is \r\nalso perpetrated by the vitiating inaction of those \r\nwho are good”. \r\n Let us fill the vacuum with new energy, new \r\ncommitments and a new common resolve. I want to \r\ntake this opportunity to elaborate on the foundations of \r\nour proposals for a lasting and peaceful settlement. \r\nFirst, we offer the alternative of security and prosperity \r\nto those who have been poisoned by the separatist \r\nillusion. We offer and recognize the right to full self-\r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n19 07-51711 \r\n \r\ngovernance for all who live in Abkhazia and South \r\nOssetia, within our sovereign territorial borders under \r\ninternational guarantees. We offer constitutional \r\nchanges to enshrine the protection of minorities \r\nincluding language rights, the protection of culture and \r\neducation. And we are even willing to offer special \r\nproperty rights to all interested groups in order to \r\nenhance their identities and to guarantee and secure \r\nthat their long-term survival will be protected by the \r\nState and the international community. Finally, we \r\noffer and welcome a robust role for the European \r\nUnion and a greater role for its engagement on the \r\nground. \r\n In short, we offer a level of autonomy grounded \r\nin the very same principles that have guided the rest of \r\nEurope in promoting peace and prosperity throughout \r\nits multi-ethnic tapestry. \r\n The continued ignorance of the ethnic cleansing \r\nin Abkhazia, Georgia is a stain on the moral account \r\nbook of the international community. These disputes \r\nare no longer about ethnic grievances; they are about \r\nthe manipulation of greed by a tiny minority of \r\nactivists, militants, militias and their foreign backers, \r\nat the expense of the local population, the displaced \r\nand those who are deprived of their property and \r\nfundamental rights — even the right to speak and study \r\nin their own language.  \r\n The choice is between a Georgia that is willing to \r\nwelcome them back with every constitutional \r\nrecognition of their identity and their rights or a bleak \r\nfuture where they are the objects of propaganda, fear \r\nand poverty, and where they are pawns in a big \r\ngeopolitical game. \r\n I have faith that we will succeed.  Their masters \r\nand foreign manipulators will not succeed.  \r\n Where does the international community stand? \r\nMy dear friends, that is the essence of the issue.  \r\n But the violent hold of the armed separatists and \r\ntheir patrons is not unbreakable. In South Ossetia, the \r\ncourage of the people, of common men and women \r\nwho have chosen dialogue over division, and \r\nreconciliation over recriminations, is making a \r\ndifference. Unfortunately, those who do not share a \r\nvision of peace and reconciliation have chosen to \r\noppose peace in South Ossetia, fearful that the power \r\nof the people and the desire to live in freedom may \r\nundermine their cynical plans. \r\n As I speak before you today, elements from \r\nRussia are actively and illegally building a new, large \r\nmilitary base in the small town of Java, in South \r\nOssetia, in the middle of Georgia, on the other side the \r\nCaucasian ridge, very far from Russian territory, \r\nhoping that arms and violence will triumph over the \r\nwill of the people. And this dangerous escalation is \r\ntaking place under the very noses of international \r\nmonitors, whose job it is to demilitarize the territory. \r\n I have brought a very conclusive body of \r\nevidence with me today, to show our friends in the \r\ninternational community the truth that others conceal. I \r\nbring that disturbing fact to the Assembly’s attention \r\nbecause reckless acts such as that must be highlighted \r\nand countered. Our collective job today is not to ask \r\nhow this is possible. Rather, it is to act with \r\ndetermination and unity. We have all the evidence, we \r\nhave video footage, documented facts and all the other \r\nevidence, and we will present it to the international \r\ncommunity, to anybody who has voiced interest in this \r\nissue. \r\n Sooner rather than later, the march of liberty will \r\nprevail. In the past year, the residents of South Ossetia \r\nhave started down a different path. They are seeking to \r\nparticipate in Georgia’s economic growth, to benefit \r\nfrom our new hospitals and our revived schools and to \r\nshare in and contribute to our democracy. It is the \r\nordinary residents of South Ossetia engaged in \r\nextraordinary acts of heroism who are making a \r\ndifference. It is the children who took their summer \r\nholidays on Georgia’s seacoast, only to return home \r\nand be barred from their schools or menaced by official \r\nauthorities, who will tear down the barriers of hate. It \r\nis the residents rebuilding their towns under gunfire. I \r\nhave specially met with the workers who continued to \r\nbuild schools, movie theatres and even discos under the \r\ngunfire of elements that wish to stop them. These are \r\nvery courageous people of different ethnicities who \r\nwant to live in peace and who are willing to take risks, \r\neven with their own lives for the sake of peace and a \r\nbetter future for their children.  \r\n It is the courage of local leaders such as Dmitry \r\nSanakoev, a former separatist leader of South Ossetia \r\nwho once bore arms against Georgia, who will lead the \r\nway. He was chosen by the people of South Ossetia in \r\ndemocratic elections to represent them. This vision will \r\nbe embraced. I believe we should respect the \r\ncourageous expression of the ethnic Ossetians who \r\nhave decided to take that path within Georgia. \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 20 \r\n \r\n The only obstacle to the integration of South \r\nOssetia is a separatist regime that basically consists of \r\nelements from security services from neighbouring \r\nRussia that have no historical ethnic or cultural links to \r\nthe territory whatsoever. I think that is a very \r\ntemporary development Now is the time to seize this \r\nhistoric opportunity to avoid the escalation of violence, \r\nwhich is a possibility and a major risk, especially in the \r\nterritory of South Ossetia. \r\n In closing, I would like to share the insights of a \r\nwoman whose name is on our minds and in our hearts \r\ntoday: Aung San Suu Kyi. Her courage, her resolve and \r\nher reflections on peace and democracy, cannot be \r\nimprisoned. They travel across every border and barrier \r\nto inspire us all. Her words are of profound relevance \r\nto the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. I believe \r\nthey also must be a beacon for all of us in this Hall. \r\n “Even under the most crushing State machinery, \r\ncourage rises up again and again, for fear is not \r\nthe natural state of civilized man. It is man’s \r\nvision of a world fit for rational, civilized \r\nhumanity which leads him to dare and suffer to \r\nbuild societies free from want and fear.” \r\n Those words poignantly reflect what is taking \r\nplace today in the streets of Burma. \r\n In our own corner of the world, for the past four \r\nyears, the people of Georgia have invested their own \r\nsweat and treasure to build such a society — one free \r\nfrom want and fear. We now must ensure that Georgia \r\nwhole and free includes all the people of South Ossetia \r\nand Abkhazia.  \r\n I believe I have been clear in stating Georgia’s \r\nintentions and equally clear as to where we are \r\nunshakeable in our principles — principles, I stress, \r\nthat are shared by all nations that seek legality and \r\nstability in the international system. \r\n We are committed to a peaceful and honest path. \r\nUnfortunately, our interlocutors do not seem to be. This \r\nmorning, a senior Russian official made the very \r\nunconstructive, unsubstantiated and untrue accusation \r\nthat Georgian forces killed two innocent people in \r\nUpper Abkhazia. What the senior Russian official \r\nfailed to say, however, is that one of the people was a \r\nlieutenant colonel of the Russian military and that he \r\nwas killed during a law enforcement operation against \r\narmed separatist insurgents. One has to wonder, what \r\nwas a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army doing on \r\nin the Georgian forests, organizing and leading a group \r\nof armed insurgents on a mission of subversion and \r\nviolence? I want to ask our Russian friends: is there not \r\nenough territory in Russia? Are there not enough \r\nforests in Russia for Russian officers not to die in \r\nGeorgian forests, on Georgian territory, for them not to \r\nfight on foreign territory for God knows what cause for \r\ntheir nation? Whatever the explanation, we regret any \r\nloss of life. That person was recruited from Russian \r\npeacekeepers and State and local militia. We do not \r\nwish anybody such an end to their life. \r\n Indeed, we will do everything possible to avoid \r\nviolence and further hostility and confrontation. This \r\nreckless and dangerous pattern of behaviour must not \r\ncontinue. \r\n In conclusion, I want to express the gratitude of \r\nGeorgia for the efforts of the United Nations and its \r\nstaff. I trust that I have demonstrated that we have the \r\nopportunity and, in Georgia, the desire to resolve our \r\ncommon challenges so that the international \r\ncommunity can commit its resources to resolving the \r\ngreat challenges of our age. Let us not lose any more \r\ntime. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Georgia for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe \r\n \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe. \r\n Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Mugabe: Allow me to congratulate \r\nMr. Kerim on his election to preside over this \r\nAssembly. We are confident that through his \r\nstewardship, issues on the agenda of the sixty-second \r\nsession will be dealt with in a balanced manner and to \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n21 07-51711 \r\n \r\nthe satisfaction of all. Allow me also to pay tribute to \r\nhis predecessor, Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, who \r\nsteered the work of the sixty-first session in a very \r\ncompetent and impartial manner. Her ability to identify \r\nthe crucial issues facing the world today will be \r\nremembered as the hallmark of her presidency. \r\n We extend our hearty welcome to the new \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has taken \r\nup this challenging job requiring dynamism in \r\nconfronting the global challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. Balancing global interests and steering the \r\nUnited Nations in a direction that gives hope to the \r\nmultitudes of the poor, the sick, the hungry and the \r\nmarginalized is indeed a mammoth task. We would like \r\nto assure him that Zimbabwe will continue to support \r\nan open, transparent and all-inclusive multilateral \r\napproach in dealing with those global challenges. \r\n Climate change is one of the most pressing global \r\nissues of our time. Its negative impact is greatest in \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly those on the African \r\ncontinent. We believe that, if the international \r\ncommunity is going to seriously address the challenges \r\nof climate change, then we need to get our priorities \r\nright. In Zimbabwe, the effects of climate change have \r\nbecome more evident in the past decade as we have \r\nwitnessed, alongside our neighbours, increased and \r\nrecurrent droughts, as well as occasional floods, \r\nleading to enormous humanitarian challenges. \r\n We are for a United Nations that recognizes the \r\nequality of sovereign nations and peoples, whether big \r\nor small. We are averse to a body in which the \r\neconomically and militarily powerful behave like \r\nbullies, trampling on the rights of weak and smaller \r\nStates, as sadly happened in Iraq. In the light of those \r\ninauspicious developments, this Organization must \r\nsurely examine the essence of its authority and the \r\nextent of its power when challenged in this manner. \r\n Such challenges to the authority of the United \r\nNations and its Charter underpin our repeated call for \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly, itself the \r\nmost representative organ of the United Nations. The \r\nGeneral Assembly should be more active in all areas, \r\nincluding those of peace and security. The \r\nencroachment of some United Nations organs upon the \r\nwork of the General Assembly is of great concern to \r\nus. Thus, any process of revitalizing or strengthening \r\nthe General Assembly should necessarily avoid eroding \r\nthe principle of the accountability of all principal and \r\nsubsidiary organs to the General Assembly. \r\n Once again, we reiterate our position that the \r\nSecurity Council as presently constituted is not \r\ndemocratic. In its present configuration, the Council \r\nhas shown that it is not in a position to protect the \r\nweaker States, who find themselves at loggerheads \r\nwith a marauding super-Power. Most importantly, \r\njustice demands that any Security Council reform \r\nshould redress the fact that Africa is the only continent \r\nwithout a permanent seat and veto power in the \r\nSecurity Council. Africa’s demands are known and \r\nenunciated in the Ezulwini Consensus. \r\n We further call for the United Nations system to \r\nrefrain from interfering in matters that are clearly the \r\ndomain of Member States and are not a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. Development at \r\ncountry level should continue to be country-led and not \r\nbe subject to the whims and caprices of powerful donor \r\nStates. \r\n Zimbabwe won its independence on 18 April \r\n1980 after a protracted war against British colonial \r\nimperialism that denied its people human rights and \r\ndemocracy. That colonial system which suppressed and \r\noppressed us enjoyed the support of many countries of \r\nthe West who were signatories to the United Nations \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Even after \r\n1945, it would appear that the Berlin Conference of \r\n1884, through which Africa was parcelled out to \r\ncolonial European powers, has remained stronger than \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is, \r\ntherefore, clear that for the West, vested economic \r\ninterests and racial and ethnocentric considerations \r\nhave proved stronger than Western adherence to \r\nprinciples of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. \r\n The West still negates our sovereignties by \r\ncontrolling our resources, in the process making us \r\nmere chattels in our own lands, mere minders of the \r\nWest’s transnational interests. In my own country and \r\nother sister States in southern Africa, the most visible \r\nform of this colonial control has been control over land \r\ndespoiled from us at the onset of British colonialism. \r\nThat control largely persists, although it stands firmly \r\nchallenged in Zimbabwe, thereby triggering the current \r\nstand-off between us and Britain, which is supported \r\nby her cousin States, most notably the United States \r\nand Australia. Mr. Bush, Mr. Blair and now  \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 22 \r\n \r\nMr. Brown’s sense of human rights precludes our \r\npeople’s right to their God-given resources, which \r\nmust, in our view, be controlled by our people. I am \r\ntermed dictator — and yesterday the General Assembly \r\nheard Mr. Bush in this Hall calling my Government a \r\ndemagogic regime — because I have rejected this \r\nsupremacist view and frustrated the neo-colonialists in \r\ntheir endeavours to keep us as slaves in our own \r\ncountry. \r\n Clearly, the history of the struggle for our own \r\nnational and people’s rights is unknown to the \r\nPresident of the United States of America. He thinks \r\nthe Declaration of Human Rights started with his terms \r\nin office. He thinks he can introduce to us, who bore \r\nthe brunt of the struggle for the freedoms of our \r\npeoples, the virtues of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights. What rank hypocrisy! I spent  \r\n11 precious years of my life in the jail of a white \r\nEnglishman whose freedom and well being I assured \r\nand protected from the first day of Zimbabwe’s \r\nindependence, and that was Ian Smith. I lost a further \r\n15 years fighting white injustice in my country. Ian \r\nSmith was responsible for the deaths of well over \r\n50,000 of my people. I bear scars of his tyranny, which \r\nBritain and America condoned. I meet his victims \r\nevery day. Yet, he walks freely today. He farms freely; \r\nhe has a farm of over 500 hectares. He talks freely, \r\nassociates freely under our black Government. We \r\ntaught him democracy. We gave him back his \r\nhumanity. He would have faced a different fate here \r\nand in Europe, if the 50,000 he killed had been \r\nEuropeans. Africa has not called for a Nuremberg trial \r\nagainst the white world, which committed heinous \r\ncrimes against humanity. It has not hunted perpetrators \r\nof this genocide, many of whom live to this day; nor \r\nhas it received reparations from those who have \r\noffended against it. Instead, it is Africa that is in the \r\ndock. It is Mugabe, and not the British Prime Minister, \r\nwho is in the dock, facing trial from the same world \r\nthat persecuted us for centuries. \r\n Let Mr. Bush read history correctly. Let him \r\nrealize that, both personally and in his representative \r\ncapacity as the current President of the United States, \r\nhe stands for this “civilization” that occupied, \r\ncolonized, incarcerated and killed. He has much to \r\natone for and very little to lecture us about on the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. His hands drip \r\nwith the innocent blood of many nationalities, and, \r\ntoday, with the blood of the Iraqis. But he still kills. He \r\nkills in Iraq. He kills in Afghanistan. And he is \r\nsupposed to be our teacher in human rights? \r\n He imprisons. He imprisons and tortures at \r\nGuantanamo. He imprisoned and tortured at Abu \r\nGhraib. He has secret torture chambers in Europe. Yes, \r\nhe imprisons even here in the United States, with his \r\njails today carrying more blacks than his universities \r\ncan ever enrol. He even suspends the provisions of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Take \r\nGuántanamo for example. At that concentration camp, \r\ninternational law does not apply. The national laws of \r\nthe people there do not apply. Laws of the United \r\nStates of America do not apply. Only Bush’s law \r\napplies. Can the international community accept being \r\nlectured by this man on the provisions of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights? Definitely not. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n We are alarmed that under his leadership basic \r\nrights of his own people and those of the rest of the \r\nworld have summarily been rolled back. America is \r\nprimarily responsible for rewriting core tenets of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. We all seem \r\nguilty for 9/11. Mr. Bush thinks he stands above all \r\nstructures of governance, whether national or \r\ninternational. At home, he apparently does not need the \r\nCongress. He defies it. Abroad, he does not need the \r\nUnited Nations; he does not need international law and \r\nopinion. “I will go to Iraq,” he said, “with or without \r\nthe United Nations” — that is, with or without \r\ninternational law, in defiance of it.  \r\n This forum did not sanction Blair’s and Bush’s \r\nmisadventures in Iraq. Did we say yes to it? Did we \r\nsay yes to the attack on Iraq? The two rode roughshod \r\nover the United Nations and international opinion. \r\nAlmighty Bush: perhaps some might regard him as \r\ntheir god. No, he is not my god. I have but one God. \r\nHe is in heaven — pater noster, qui es in caelis. \r\nIndeed, he wants us to pray to him. We say no to him \r\nand encourage him to get out of Iraq. Indeed, he should \r\nmend his ways before he clambers up the pulpit to \r\ndeliver pieties of democracy. Is he qualified to speak of \r\ndemocracy? Is he qualified to speak of human rights \r\nwhen he is shedding blood every day? \r\n The British and the Americans have gone on a \r\nrelentless campaign of destabilizing and vilifying my \r\ncountry. They have sponsored surrogate forces to \r\nchallenge lawful authority in my country. They seek \r\nregime change. It is they who seek regime change, not \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n23 07-51711 \r\n \r\nmy people. But they think they are entitled to change \r\ngovernments, placing themselves in the role of the \r\nZimbabwean people in whose collective will \r\ndemocracy places the right to define and change \r\nregimes. And they want to talk of democracy when \r\nthey are behaving that way.  \r\n Let those sinister Governments be told here and \r\nnow that Zimbabwe will not allow a regime change \r\nauthored by outsiders. We do not interfere with their \r\nsystems in America and Britain, where they steal \r\nelections, as he did during his first election. We do not \r\ninterfere. Mr. Bush and Mr. Brown have no role to play \r\nin our national affairs. They are outsiders — and \r\nmischievous outsiders — and should therefore keep \r\nout. The colonial sun set a long time ago in Africa — \r\nin 1980 in the case of Zimbabwe. And hence, \r\nZimbabwe will never be a colony again — never, ever. \r\n We do not deserve sanctions. We are \r\nZimbabweans and we know how to deal with our own \r\nproblems. We have done so in the past, well before \r\nBush and Brown were known politically. We have our \r\nown regional and continental organizations and \r\ncommunities. In that vein, I wish to express my \r\ncountry’s gratitude to President Thabo Mbeki of South \r\nAfrica who, on behalf of the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), successfully \r\nfacilitated the dialogue between my ruling party and \r\nthe opposition parties, which yielded the agreement \r\nthat has now resulted in the constitutional provisions \r\nbeing finally adopted — the amendments to the \r\nconstitution, which both parties agreed to and which \r\npaved the way to the elections for which various \r\nparties are now campaigning. Consequently, we will be \r\nholding multiple democratic elections in March 2008. \r\nIndeed, we have always had timeous general and \r\npresidential elections since our independence. \r\n We want to be left alone. We will interact with \r\nthose in our region and those in organizations to which \r\nwe belong. \r\n In conclusion, let me stress once more that the \r\nstrength of the United Nations lies in its universality \r\nand its impartiality as it implements its mandate to \r\npromote peace and security, economic and social \r\ndevelopment, human rights and international law, as \r\noutlined in the Charter. Zimbabwe stands ready to play \r\nits part in all efforts and programmes aimed at \r\nachieving those noble goals. The Charter of the United \r\nNations is our Charter also in Africa and we uphold it. \r\nWrath unto him who defies the Charter. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nRepublic of Bolivia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Bolivia. \r\n Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the Republic \r\nof Bolivia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThis is the second time I have addressed the Assembly \r\nin my 20 months as President. I come here to share our \r\nexperiences with the Presidents of the many countries \r\nof our world. I wish to take this opportunity to say how \r\npleased I am at the election of a new Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who will be leading the international \r\nOrganization for the good of humankind, and above all, \r\nfor the good of the abandoned and the dispossessed. \r\nFor that reason, I wish to briefly comment on my own \r\ncountry.  \r\n For the first time in Bolivian history, the groups \r\nmost forgotten, despised, hated and reviled throughout \r\nthe history of Bolivia — we indigenous peoples — \r\nhave assumed the leadership of our country to change \r\nour beloved Bolivia — to make political and economic \r\nchanges, to reshape and re-establish our country, \r\norienting it towards searching for unity, respecting our \r\ndifferences and respecting our identity so that we can \r\nwork together to resolve our economic and social \r\nproblems.  \r\n In this brief period, I have felt and seen that it \r\nwill be difficult and will mean fighting for the equality \r\nand justice of peoples, of all of us who live in the \r\nhomeland. But at the same time, we shall do so with a \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 24 \r\n \r\ngreat deal of strength, because the popular movement, \r\nthe indigenous movement and the intellectuals and \r\neven the business and professional communities, have \r\ntaken a chance on their land and their people, and are \r\nstriving peacefully for democratization, ensuring a \r\ncultural revolution in my country.  \r\n But sometimes it is more important to regain our \r\nnatural resources. I very much regret to say that in my \r\ncountry, during the neoliberal regimes, natural \r\nresources and State-owned enterprises were privatized \r\nunder the pretext of capitalization. In fact, they \r\ndecapitalized the country, claiming that private \r\nenterprise would be the solution for unemployment and \r\ncorruption. We actually saw an increase in \r\nunemployment and in corruption. Just a few years ago, \r\nBolivia was considered to be the world’s runner-up of \r\ncorruption, but now I am delighted to see that \r\ninternational organizations have said that there has \r\nbeen a great decrease in corruption in Bolivia. We want \r\nto eradicate it.  \r\n I want members to know that in 2005, before I \r\nbecame President of the Republic, Bolivia received \r\nonly $300 million in revenue from hydrocarbons. That \r\nwas a time when hydrocarbons, oil and natural gas \r\nwere privatized, when they were given to the \r\ntransnationals. Now that we have changed the oil laws \r\nand nationalized and recovered these very important \r\nnatural resources, Bolivia will receive more than \r\n$2 billion in revenue this year.  \r\n For that reason, Bolivia wants to share its \r\nexperience with all leaders and with all nations where \r\nnatural resources have been privatized. It is important, \r\nwith the strength of the people, to recover these natural \r\nresources so that they can benefit the people and the \r\nnation. Of course, I completely understand that \r\ncompanies have the right to recover the economic \r\nresources that they have invested. They have a right to \r\nprofit, but not like in the past when all they were \r\nconcerned with was plundering our natural resources.  \r\n The most important thing in all of this is that we \r\nhave begun to decolonize Bolivia, both internally and \r\nexternally. I say internally because my country \r\npreviously had masters. If we look back at our history, \r\nthere were masters that were descended from the \r\nviceroys, religious groups and the oligarchy. They \r\nruled and the people were powerless. Now we are \r\nbuilding up the power of the people so that the people \r\nare sovereign, not groups of families, and so that we, \r\nthe peoples, have the right to decide on our future.  \r\n That is the best kind of democracy we can \r\nimplement, because it does not mean merely accepting \r\ncertain policies or being subjugated by masters or \r\nbosses in my country. When I say that we are \r\ndecolonizing externally as well, I mean that right now, \r\nthere are no ambassadors in my country who change or \r\nappoint ministers. Before, unfortunately, United States \r\nambassadors changed and appointed ministers. That is \r\nover. Thus, we have begun to decolonize our country.  \r\n Once, policies were imposed on us by the World \r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund. That is \r\nover too. I would like to share a little story about our \r\ncountry that I remember clearly. In 2003, the World \r\nBank and the International Monetary Fund told our \r\nleadership to choose between a gasoline tax and an \r\nincome tax to avoid a deficit. The Government decided \r\nto put a tax on workers’ wages. In two days more than \r\n15 people died in Bolivia because of clashes among \r\nBolivians. \r\n Now let me say that last year, without income \r\ntaxes, without gasoline taxes, Bolivia had a surplus \r\nthanks to the return of a natural resource, \r\nhydrocarbons, that is so important for my country.  \r\n That is why I say that we have begun external \r\ndecolonization. We are gathering the proposals and \r\ninitiatives of our peoples organized in civic and trade \r\nunion forums, in particular people who have economic \r\nproblems. They have the wisdom to propose initiatives \r\nand solutions from their own neighbourhoods and from \r\ntheir own trade unions. That is my experience, and so I \r\nthink it is important to create people’s power. Let \r\nsocial forces take the decisions, and let the leaders \r\nfollow the wishes of the people. In that way we can \r\nresolve our problems.  \r\n Over the past few days I have listened to some \r\nvery encouraging statements, but also some that were \r\nrather disappointing. They spoke, for example, of \r\nglobal warming and of climate change, and I know that \r\nmany countries are victims of these natural \r\nphenomena. But I cannot understand why so many \r\nlives are lost to floods, interventionism, war and \r\nhunger? It seems that economic models are not going \r\nto solve the problems of humankind. I am all the more \r\nconvinced of that after having heard many of those \r\nstatements and the experiences that have been shared \r\nby world leaders. Concentrating capital in the hands of \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n25 07-51711 \r\n \r\nthe few is not a solution to the problems of humankind. \r\nHaving the wealth of the world in the hands of the few \r\ndoes not solve the problems of human existence. \r\nIndeed, it exacerbates problems of the poor who \r\ninhabit planet Earth.  \r\n We talk of global warming and the melting of the \r\nice, but we do not say where it comes from. I am \r\nconvinced that it comes from that ill-termed \r\nglobalization — or selective globalization: a \r\nglobalization that does not respect plurality and that \r\ndoes not respect differences.  \r\n If we are to talk about globalization, first of all \r\nwe must globalize the human being. I do not know how \r\neveryone here got to New York — or to the United \r\nStates — but my delegation had many visa problems. \r\nOur parliamentarians could not obtain United States \r\nvisas. When I arrived at the airport, I was blocked, and \r\nmy ministers — my indigenous compatriots — were \r\nsubjected to hours and hours of controls at the airport. \r\nSome of us, the representatives of countries, were \r\npractically threatened by our hosts, by President Bush. \r\nIf that continues, perhaps we should seriously consider, \r\nas Presidents and nations, changing the site of the \r\nUnited Nations. I personally am not willing to come \r\nhere to be the subject of investigation. I feel that the \r\ndecolonization of the United Nations too should begin \r\nand that everyone should respect us, whether we are \r\nsmall or large, whether we have or do not have \r\nproblems.  \r\n I listen to statements about glaciers melting, and \r\nthey are made without addressing the underlying \r\ncauses of melting and global warming. It is capitalism \r\nand the exaggerated, unrestricted form of \r\nindustrialization in some countries which are creating \r\nso many problems on our continent and on planet Earth \r\nas a whole. When we organize alongside social \r\nmovements to protest and condemn these unsustainable \r\npolicies, these economic models that do not solve \r\neconomic problems, then what we get is military bases \r\nand interventions, wars, demonization, accusations of \r\nterrorism, as though peoples had no right to speak out \r\nabout their needs, their rights, or to formulate new \r\napproaches to saving lives and humankind.  \r\n I therefore believe that it is important for us, as \r\nPresidents, nations or delegates, to tell the truth in all \r\nsincerity about these economic problems, which are not \r\nexclusive to Bolivia, North America or South America. \r\nWhen the democratic change is under way in South \r\nAmerica — i.e. the kind of democracy that liberates \r\nand does not submit to imperialism — there are further \r\naccusations and misrepresentations. There are \r\naccusations of people being cruel dictators, such as \r\nthose I heard from the lips of President Bush yesterday \r\nwith respect to the President of Cuba. I wish to greet \r\nall revolutionaries, especially President Fidel, for \r\nwhom I have a great deal of respect. Fidel also sends \r\ntroops to many countries, but they are sent to save \r\nlives, whereas the President of the United States sends \r\ntroops to end human lives. Therefore, since we here \r\ntoday are presidents, let us think about life, \r\nhumankind, how to save planet Earth and the question \r\nof climate change, which is a subject of ongoing debate \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n I am convinced that it is not possible for basic \r\nservices to remain private enterprises. Fortunately, \r\nthanks to the foreign ministries of the Americas, water \r\nhas been recognized as a human right. If water is a \r\nhuman right, it is important that it should become a \r\npublic utility, instead of a private business. It is \r\nimportant that energy should now also be a human \r\nright. I hope that we can all ensure that energy is a \r\nhuman right. If energy is a human right, then it will \r\nnever again be a private business. It must be a public \r\nutility so as to meet the needs of our people.  \r\n I cannot understand how we can continue, under \r\nthe guise of hegemony or of concentrating capital in a \r\nfew hands, to do damage to humankind, to affect the \r\npoor and to marginalize other needy sectors. I feel we \r\nare making statements here in order to change these \r\neconomic policies that have done, and continue to do, \r\nso much damage and that are leading humankind down \r\nthe path to genocide.  \r\n I still fail to understand why some countries are \r\ninvolved in an arms race. I cannot accept war. In \r\nBolivia we are discussing, as a social and political \r\nendeavour, how a new political constitution could lead \r\nus to renounce war. I am convinced that war is the \r\nindustry of death and that the arms race is one more \r\nindustry that complements the industry of death. In this \r\nnew millennium, how can countries and presidents \r\nkeep thinking in terms of interventionism, \r\nauthoritarianism and arrogance on the part of some \r\ncountries towards other countries, and not think about \r\nhumankind?  \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 26 \r\n \r\n I believe that we must work together to save \r\nplanet Earth. That is the most important thing, if we \r\nwant to save life and humankind.  \r\n Yesterday, too, I heard, and tried to comprehend, \r\nstatements about biofuels and agrofuels. I do not \r\nunderstand how we can make use of agricultural \r\nproducts or food when it comes to cars. I cannot accept \r\nthat that is what the products of the earth should be for. \r\nI believe that food should be for human beings and that \r\nsoil should be for life. Are we really going to divert our \r\nland and food resources to provide for automobiles \r\nbecause of a gasoline or diesel shortage? Two days \r\nago, I said that if we are really talking about life, then \r\nlet us give up luxury. It is important to give up luxury. \r\nWe cannot continue to accumulate garbage, we cannot \r\ncontinue to think about just a few families instead of \r\nthinking about all of humankind. I think we have \r\nprofound differences, when we talk about these matters \r\nof life and about our national majorities.  \r\n I want to take this opportunity to express thanks \r\nfor the support received from everyone, with the \r\nexception of four Governments, for the adoption of the \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We \r\nfeel very gratified. The peoples of the Americas have \r\nwaited for over 500 years for their rights to be \r\nrecognized. We are part of a culture of patience. I wish \r\nto say that the fact that we now have this Declaration \r\ndoes not mean that we will act vindictively towards \r\nothers. Indigenous people are not vengeful. We are part \r\nof the culture of dialogue and, most fundamentally, \r\npart of the culture of life.  \r\n I want to ask the United Nations to convene very \r\nsoon a United Nations world summit of indigenous \r\npeoples to compile data on different cultural \r\nexperiences. We are compiling data on our experiences \r\nin Bolivia through a programme called “Living Well”. \r\nTo live better, one must sometimes exploit. To live \r\nbetter, one must sometimes rob. To live better, one \r\nmust sometimes discriminate. To live better, one must \r\nsometimes plunder. But to live well means to live in \r\ncommunity, collectively. This does not just apply to \r\nliving among human beings. It also means living well \r\nin harmony with Mother Earth. The earth, for the \r\nindigenous movement, is something sacred. Mother \r\nEarth is our very life, it is Pacha Mama, as we say in \r\nour languages. Mother Earth cannot be turned into \r\nmerchandise. Mother Earth cannot be turned into a \r\nbusiness. If we talk about global warming, if we protest \r\nand fight global warming, let us remember that we are \r\ntalking about Mother Earth. Since Mother Earth gives \r\nus life, we need to review our policies, but we also \r\nneed to pay attention to what has been stated by our \r\nindigenous movement.  \r\n We have lived in communities, collectively. What \r\nis being debated is collectivism and community against \r\ncapitalism. Let us continue to debate, to reclaim these \r\nways of life in order to defend life and to save \r\nhumankind. \r\n I also want to take a moment to say that this new \r\nmillennium must be the millennium of life, equality \r\nand justice, of respecting our identities and upholding \r\nhuman dignity. That is why we are talking about \r\nchanging economic models, those systems that do harm \r\nto mankind. But if we want to make changes, then it is \r\nimportant for us to change ourselves first. Let us not be \r\nselfish, individualistic, greedy, ambitious or sectarian \r\nin our attitudes, concerning ourselves with just a few \r\nfamilies instead of with the entire family on Mother \r\nEarth. So as presidents, as representatives of our \r\ndifferent nations, we are talking about changing \r\nourselves first, with a view to also changing economic \r\nmodels in a quest for equality and justice. During my \r\n20 months as President, I have learned that I must work \r\nwith the people and listen to their needs. There will \r\nalways be groups who do not wish to lose their \r\nprivileges, but those are ill-gotten privileges or \r\nprivileges that enable them to use the State for family \r\nbusiness rather than thinking of the families of others.  \r\n I have learned, during my 20 months as President, \r\nhow wonderful it would have been to work for the \r\nhomeland and not for money, how wonderful it would \r\nhave been to work for those abandoned by the peoples, \r\nhow wonderful it would have been to work together \r\nwith people who do not have many economic problems \r\nbut who cherish their homeland and want to work for it \r\nin solidarity and with a sense of complementarity.  \r\n I would also like to say that, as members know, \r\nwe have a historic problem with our sister republic of \r\nChile on the subject of the sea. We have now \r\nsucceeded in laying the foundations of a certain trust \r\nbetween us: trust between our peoples, our \r\nGovernments and our Presidents, through peoples’ \r\ndiplomacy. It is our hope that these historic claims can \r\nbe worked on and resolved, within the framework of \r\ncomplementarity, because neighbouring countries, \r\nLatin American countries and the countries of the \r\nworld need to work in a complementary way if we \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n27 07-51711 \r\n \r\nwant to resolve the problems of our peoples and \r\nnations. Complementarity is very important, and that is \r\nwhy we want to continue to work for humankind.  \r\n In conclusion — sometimes the red light on the \r\nrostrum makes one nervous, but never mind — I would \r\nlike to say that I hope we can keep learning from \r\nevents of this kind, in which so many participate. \r\nThese are the best universities we have. But let us \r\nspeak clearly and sincerely. Let us not falsify the truth, \r\nwhen we talk only about the effects of humankind’s \r\nproblems and not their causes. In that context, I want to \r\nsay that it is important to change our economic models \r\nand eradicate capitalism.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Bolivia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the Republic \r\nof Bolivia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the \r\nCzech Republic \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Czech Republic. \r\n Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Václav Klaus, President of \r\nthe Czech Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Klaus: Allow me to congratulate you, \r\nSir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session. I also welcome \r\nthe highly respected Secretary-General to the first \r\nsession of the Assembly convened since he assumed \r\nhis post. \r\n I would like to start by saying that my country is \r\nproud to be one of the founding fathers of the United \r\nNations in its current form. The Czech Republic, a \r\nsuccessor State of Czechoslovakia, participated \r\nactively in all kinds of United Nations activities in the \r\npast and it will continue to do so in the future. We take \r\npart in the work not only of the United Nations itself, \r\nbut also of its specialized organizations and agencies \r\nsuch as UNESCO, the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of \r\nthe United Nations, the World Health Organization, the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and many others. \r\nWe have always supported any meaningful initiative \r\nthat leads to the increase of stability and prosperity in \r\nthe world. \r\n I am proud to confirm that the Czech Republic \r\nhas the ambition to be elected to the Security Council \r\nas a non-permanent member for the period 2008-2009. \r\nI believe that we can be trusted by the majority of \r\nMember countries and that we deserve their votes. We \r\nare convinced that we have already demonstrated our \r\ndevotion to freedom, democracy, international \r\ncooperation, economic development and respect for the \r\nsovereignty of countries belonging to the community \r\nof nations. My country served in the Security Council \r\nin 1994-1995. We tried to do our best. We were reliable \r\nand committed to hard work. I can assure the Assembly \r\nthat we will now do an even a better job. \r\n We have always recognized the principal \r\nresponsibility of the Security Council for maintaining \r\npeace and security. Since the 1990s, the Czech \r\nRepublic has contributed to more than 20 United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions and United Nations-\r\nmandated operations in the Balkans, Asia and Africa. \r\nWe deeply believe in the prevention and non-violent \r\nresolution of disputes and conflicts. That can be proved \r\nby our own behaviour; witness the peaceful dissolution \r\nof Czechoslovakia in 1992. Over the past several years, \r\nwe have also multiplied our official development \r\nassistance. \r\n In the past 18 years, the Czech Republic has \r\nundergone radical and dynamic development, which \r\nwas made possible by the fall of communism and by \r\nour rapid departure from that oppressive, inhuman and \r\ninefficient political, social and economic system. Our \r\ntransformation strategy, based on the acceptance of \r\npolitical pluralism, parliamentary democracy and a \r\nmarket economy, was successful. \r\n A further important impetus to our development \r\nwas our approaching the European Union and our entry \r\ninto it three years ago. Today, the Czech Republic is a \r\nfull-fledged member of the Union and will hold the \r\nEuropean Union presidency in the first half of 2009. It \r\nmight be of interest to the Assembly that the slogan of \r\nthe Czech presidency will be “Europe without \r\nbarriers”. We mean by that the removing of both \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 28 \r\n \r\ninternal and external European Union barriers. I fully \r\nsupport that concept, as I strongly believe in the need \r\nto remove barriers that hinder economic progress, \r\nespecially in developing countries. \r\n We consider the United Nations to be an \r\nextremely important and, in fact, irreplaceable \r\nplatform. There is no substitute for it in the current \r\nworld. It is a platform for meetings and consultations, \r\nfor dialogue and, eventually, for reaching agreements \r\non treaties among nations sharing the same or similar \r\nvalues and political stances. This unique platform is \r\nbased on the plurality of views of its 192 Member \r\ncountries and on our mutual respect for our sometimes \r\ndiffering positions. The ambition of the United Nations \r\nis not, and should never be, the search for one \r\nobligatory, unitary view imposed by some of us on \r\nthose who disagree. \r\n I did not use the term “platform” by chance and \r\nwithout purpose. By using it, I implicitly object to the \r\nalternative concept: the concept of global governance \r\nbased on the indefensible idea that the world can be \r\nglobally governed, masterminded, controlled, managed \r\nand/or even planned. To aspire to do that is something \r\nwe can never accept. It is an ambition based on the \r\nabuse of reason and on the pretence of knowledge. \r\nDemocracy is something else. \r\n There are some among us who prefer the \r\noperational efficiency — or the ability to act — of this \r\nOrganization to the recognition of the existence of \r\ndifferent views. They want to make decisions in an \r\neasier and faster way. Our communist past tells us that \r\nwe should not do that. We also want the United Nations \r\nto be reasonably operational, but we categorically \r\noppose that happening at the expense of individual \r\nMember States. We have to respect the views of \r\nindividual member countries regardless of their size. It \r\nis crucial that every Member State has equal status and \r\nthat its voice not be ignored. \r\n We have to go forward. The United Nations needs \r\nchanges. We do support reform of the United Nations, \r\nbecause the Organization should reflect the current \r\nsituation in the world more than the situation of the era \r\nwhen it was founded. Some changes are inevitable, and \r\nwe should discuss them seriously. \r\n To our great regret, in the world at present we are \r\nwitnessing many cases where there is a lack of freedom \r\nand democracy. Our task for the future is to minimize \r\nsuch cases. However, I do not see and hear the terms \r\n“freedom” and “democracy” as much or as often as \r\nthey deserve. We hear other words more frequently — \r\naid, government initiatives and interventions, social \r\njustice, positive rights, environment, resources, \r\nclimate, problem solving, facing threats and global \r\nchallenges among others. \r\n Here we have to be very careful. We should \r\nsupport meaningful activities, not programmes that in \r\neffect put constraints on local development. We should \r\nuse natural resources efficiently and protect the \r\nenvironment, but not in a way that restricts human \r\nactivity and harms economic development. We would \r\nhelp global development more by reducing barriers \r\nthan by providing conditional aid. Reducing \r\nprotectionism and lowering export subsidies is a far \r\nmore efficient way to help developing countries than \r\nanything else. We should not allow developing \r\ncountries to be blocked from their own economic \r\ngrowth by additional burdens imposed upon them that \r\nthey will not be able to bear. \r\n At the conference on climate change held the day \r\nbefore yesterday, I resolutely warned against the \r\nunjustified alarmism of global-warming activists and \r\ntheir fellow-travellers in some Governments and \r\ninternational organizations, but even that potential \r\nproblem, as well as any other, can never be solved \r\nwithout relying on freedom, free markets, free trade \r\nand other attributes of free society. \r\n Preserving the environment is very important, but \r\nwe have to be modest in our attempts to control the \r\ncomplexities of the world. Let us use the potential of \r\nthis Organization as much as possible. Let us \r\ncooperate, let us listen to each other, let us negotiate to \r\nthe last possible moment and let us try to understand \r\nothers. The Czech Republic tries to follow those rules. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Czech \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Václev Klaus, President of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Rafael Correa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador  \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ecuador. \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n29 07-51711 \r\n \r\n Mr. Rafael Correa, President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Rafael Correa, President of \r\nthe Republic of Ecuador, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Correa (spoke in Spanish): Allow me \r\nto begin my statement by recalling the commitment to \r\nfight poverty, in force since September 2000, when 189 \r\ncountries signed the Millennium Declaration, which \r\nincluded the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nOn that agreement we undertook to meet by 2015 some \r\nbasic goals on the path of human development. \r\n Today, from a Government that has declared in \r\nEcuador a citizens’ revolution, one that is democratic, \r\nethical and nationalist, we wish to set out some critical \r\nthoughts with regard to the very concept of the MDGs, \r\ntheir limitations and the dangers that minimum \r\nprogrammes of that nature entail, in particular with \r\nregard to the profound social and economic inequalities \r\nthat exist on the planet. \r\n The first limitation of the MDGs is that they \r\nconstitute a minimum as a poverty-reducing strategy. \r\nOur goal is to go much further than such minimums by \r\ngoing into greater depth on those objectives and \r\nincorporating others. The fact that we subscribe \r\nexclusively to a focus on minimum needs, such as that \r\npresented in the MDGs, carries a high risk that in \r\nseeking to satisfy our consciences we limit the \r\naspirations for social change. \r\n I think it is fair to say that there are two \r\nthresholds by which we can characterize the lives of \r\npeople. The first has to do with the indispensable \r\nabilities of human beings to survive within a society \r\nand without which life could not be called human. The \r\nsecond refers to the capacities that allow each \r\nindividual to be fulfilled within that society. We are \r\nspeaking not only about subsistence, but of the right to \r\nenjoy a life that is worthy of living. \r\n Ecuador believes that to have the goal of living \r\non $1 plus 1 cent per day — in order to supposedly \r\novercome extreme poverty or to avoid dying \r\nprematurely, as one might deduce from the MDGs — \r\ndoes not lead to a dignified life. The development of \r\npublic policies in a country that is attempting to bring \r\nabout radical change — as is the case in Ecuador — \r\ncannot be satisfied with those minimum objectives. \r\nObviously, avoiding the premature death of girls and \r\nboys or of pregnant women is an objective that nobody \r\nwould question. However, if we base ourselves only on \r\nthat, we run the risk of agreeing that human life is \r\nsimply a process of resistance, the aim of which is to \r\nextend someone’s existence by a few more hours. \r\n What we propose therefore are common goals, \r\nnot only with regard to living minimums but with \r\nregard to social maximums as well. For example, we \r\nfeel that it is possible to draw on diverse identities, to \r\nbuild and restore public areas, to guarantee access to \r\njustice and to have work which enables people to enjoy \r\nthe right to support themselves and to have time for \r\ncontemplation, artistic creation and recreation — goals \r\nthat are already contained in the national development \r\nplan that is being implemented by the Government of \r\nEcuador.  \r\n Accordingly, we renounce the idea of a \r\nhistorically inevitable present to which we must \r\nsurrender by simply looking for minimums that are \r\nclearly basic. Furthermore, to be satisfied with the \r\nminimum also means — and that is very serious — \r\nlegitimizing the reality that we experience because the \r\nminimum will not alter the distance and power \r\nrelationships between individuals and between \r\nsocieties. Hence, we also favour the recognition of \r\nequal dignity for all human beings. Granting some \r\npeople certain minimums must be an initial and \r\ntemporary goal and must never be considered a modus \r\noperandi of public policy. For that means that the \r\n“beneficiary” is placed in a position of inferiority \r\ncompared to everyone else. In other words, it means \r\nthat their dignity is not recognized as equal with \r\neveryone else’s. In fact, it is no accident that \r\ninternational bureaucracies such as the World Bank \r\nalways suggest producing poverty reports, but never \r\nconsider publishing inequality reports. \r\n For this reason, perhaps the best way to reduce \r\npoverty with dignity is to reduce social, economic, \r\nterritorial, environmental and cultural gaps. One of my \r\nGovernment’s main goals is thus to reduce inequality \r\nin an endogenous development framework of economic \r\ninclusion and socio-territorial cohesion, domestically \r\nas well as within the global system. And along the \r\nsame lines, we in Ecuador are seeking to apply the rule \r\nof human rights and universal values. On the other \r\nhand, the long and sad neoliberal night proposed — \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 30 \r\n \r\nfrom an existential perspective with its consequent \r\nabsolutism of the market — social programmes that \r\nended up by breaking up society into as many parts as \r\nthere are social groups.  \r\n However, a national plan and a change in the \r\npower relationships within a society do not mean that \r\nall the fragments will come together. There is no claim \r\nthat, by some twist of fate, these will acquire meaning \r\nand coherence and will assemble themselves like the \r\npieces of a puzzle — even if some of the pieces are \r\nmissing. It is indispensable to have a common plan that \r\nmust be constantly redesigned and whose goal must be \r\nthat we all want to be part of it. \r\n That is why, in Ecuador, we are creating our \r\nnational development plan in a democratic fashion. We \r\nknow that without everyone’s participation in society’s \r\nbasic decisions, no country can legitimize its public \r\ndecision-making and make it more efficient. We must \r\nchange a political practice employed by the traditional \r\nsectors, with their technocrats and elites, and return \r\nspeech and action to those who should be the owners, \r\nprotagonists and beneficiaries of public policy.  \r\n I would like furthermore to point out that the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) offer a vision \r\nof development that is linked to consumption and a \r\nstrategy linked to processes of economic liberalization. \r\nOur view on development is very different from that. \r\nWe understand development to be the attainment of a \r\ngood standard of living for everyone, in peace and in \r\nharmony with nature, and with the indefinite extension \r\nof human cultures. In that respect, we are extremely \r\nhappy to see that the Assembly has broadly debated the \r\ndevastating and unjust effects of climate change.  \r\n Ecuador has submitted a specific and innovative \r\nproposal to contribute to the reduction of carbon \r\ndioxide emissions and to the preservation of \r\nbiodiversity: our Yasuni-ITT proposal. It involves a \r\ncommitment not to extract some 920 million barrels of \r\noil, thereby avoiding the emission of approximately \r\n111 million tons of carbon that would come from the \r\nburning of this fossil fuel. However, that will mean that \r\nwe will have to forgo significant investments of around \r\n$720 million each year, a very significant amount for \r\nthe economy of Ecuador.  \r\n We are prepared to make this huge sacrifice, but \r\nwe also ask for shared responsibility on the part of the \r\ninternational community, particularly on the part of \r\ndeveloped countries, the planet’s main predators, and \r\nfor a minimum compensation for the environmental \r\nbenefits that we are generating. That would be an \r\nextraordinary example of global collective action, \r\nsetting aside rhetoric in favour of concrete facts and \r\npractical actions: not only would it reduce global \r\nwarming for the benefit of the whole planet, but it \r\nwould also bring about a new way of thinking about \r\neconomics in the twenty-first century, where the \r\ngeneration of value is compensated, not just the \r\ngeneration of goods. \r\n Speaking of cultures, we were very happy to see \r\nthat the General Assembly recently adopted the \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \r\n(resolution 61/295), which was sponsored very actively \r\nby Ecuador. The Declaration is an instrument that had \r\nto wait more than 20 years to be adopted and that will \r\nbe the fundamental charter for the protection of human \r\nrights of our indigenous peoples. \r\n Finally, the good living that we are talking about \r\npresupposes that genuine individual freedoms, \r\nopportunities and potentials be enhanced. An immoral \r\nparadox arises here: at the world level, we are \r\npromoting the free movement of goods and capital, \r\nlooking for the highest profitability. But, on the other \r\nhand, we are penalizing the free circulation of people \r\nwho are looking for decent jobs. That is quite simply \r\nintolerable and absolutely unsustainable from an \r\nethical point of view.  \r\n For the Government of Ecuador, there are no \r\nillegal human beings. There is no such thing, and the \r\nUnited Nations must insist on this point. There is no \r\nsuch person as an illegal human being. It is not \r\npermissible to think in that way. We are working \r\nactively to bring about changes in the shameful \r\ninternational migration policies, particularly those of \r\nthe countries of the so-called first world, without \r\nforgetting, of course, that our greatest responsibility is \r\nto build a country that will guarantee decent life as a \r\nway of preventing forced exodus because of poverty \r\nand exclusion.  \r\n We must not be misled by those who proclaim the \r\nend of ideologies and the end of history. Conservatives \r\nwant to make us believe that we live in the best of all \r\npossible worlds and that we have to abandon any \r\nattempt at change, any attempt to build our own \r\nindividual and collective identity, any attempt to build \r\nour own history. In the face of such a miserly and self-\r\nsatisfied worldview, we say that it is possible to have \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n31 07-51711 \r\n \r\ncollective action that is both aware and democratic, in \r\norder to direct our lives and organize world society in a \r\ndifferent way with a more human face. Our \r\nunderstanding of development obliges us to recognize \r\none another, understand one another and appreciate one \r\nanother, so that we can move towards self-realization \r\nand the building of a shared future. Ecuador invites the \r\nAssembly to build this world, this dream.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Ecuador for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Rafael Correa, President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Poland. \r\n Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President \r\nof the Republic of Poland, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Kaczyński (spoke in Polish; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I wish to begin by \r\nconveying my respect and gratitude to Ms. Haya \r\nRashed Al-Khalifa, who presided over the sixty-first \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I also sincerely \r\ncongratulate her successor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, the \r\nnewly elected President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session.  \r\n The current session is the best proof that we live \r\nin a world of numerous contradictions and multiple \r\napproaches to the basic issues facing humankind today. \r\nWe can say that what some people took to be obvious \r\nfollowing the fall of communism in 1989, which came \r\nto be called the end of history in the academic world, \r\nwas not borne out by reality. History is rife with such \r\ncontradictions, which are linked above all to \r\ninequalities in economic development between various \r\ncountries and regions. Echoes of those inequalities are \r\nheard every year in this Assembly Hall, and we have \r\nheard them today as well. \r\n The problem is closely tied to an issue that has \r\nbeen discussed in the past few days in the course of the \r\nhigh-level event on climate change. I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his initiative of convening that \r\nevent. The topic of global warming is one of the key \r\nthemes of this session. The problem can be considered \r\nfrom various perspectives. \r\n First, as President Václav Klaus of the Czech \r\nRepublic noted, the causes of global warming are not \r\nobvious. A debate is under way concerning those \r\ncauses. In my country, some support the theory that \r\nclimate change is not caused by human activities, but \r\nthose people are in the minority. Most experts in the \r\nfield claim that human economic activities, especially \r\nthe generation of carbon dioxide, are the factors behind \r\nclimate change, which has been dramatically described \r\nby many speakers over the past two days. \r\n The problems and the efforts to resolve them are \r\nintrinsically linked to the contradictions of our world. \r\nWhen the first climate convention was adopted some \r\n12 years ago, the developed countries were believed to \r\nbe the main perpetrators of excessive carbon dioxide \r\nemissions, but much has changed since then. In many \r\nrespects, we have observed changes for the better. Two \r\nof the largest countries on the planet, China and India, \r\nhave begun to grow dynamically. That growth has \r\nclearly led to increased emissions to carbon dioxide, \r\nwhich contribute to climate warming. \r\n How can we solve the problem? The 1997 Kyoto \r\nProtocol set out three methods, two of which would \r\ncontribute most to limiting the carbon dioxide \r\nemissions of the highly developed countries, while the \r\nthird alone promotes, to a certain degree, the mitigation \r\nof such emissions by the less developed. The results of \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol have been significant, but they do \r\nnot resolve every issue and the Protocol has not been \r\nratified by every country. Many powerful States have \r\nfailed to adopt it, but in any case it will no longer be in \r\neffect after 2012. \r\n Thus, the world is facing a new challenge. On the \r\none hand, as the representative of a developed \r\ncountry — though it is not among the most \r\ndeveloped — I would stress that we cannot limit the \r\nless wealthy countries’ right to development. On the \r\nother, we must make progress towards resolving the \r\nproblems under discussion. We must therefore consider \r\nthe best way to achieve progress. \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 32 \r\n \r\n I agree with those who claim, regardless of the \r\ncountries they represent, that the problem cannot be \r\nresolved exclusively by methods linked to the pursuit \r\nof profit and the treatment of all goods as \r\ncommodities — in other words, by the application of \r\npurely economic instruments. The market economy is \r\nthe most efficient means of achieving economic growth \r\nand generating welfare, as attested by the failure of the \r\ncommunist system. However, market rules cannot be \r\nthe sole principle governing not only the economy, but \r\nalso social life and international relations. In that \r\nregard, as I did last year, I call for a much higher \r\ndegree of solidarity. Without far-reaching assistance \r\nfrom the highly developed countries to countries that \r\nare rapidly developing or hoping to grow faster, there \r\nis no possibility of success. \r\n What should such assistance consist of? Well, \r\nfirst of all, the transmission of technologies that \r\ncontribute to mitigating emissions. Does the world now \r\nhave regional organizations that would provide for the \r\ntransfer of resources from country to country on a \r\nmajor scale? Yes, indeed. We have such countries and \r\norganizations, for instance, the European Union (EU), \r\nwhich serves as evidence of the existence of such \r\nframeworks. Of course, the EU deals with general \r\ndevelopment and the protection against climate change, \r\nbut, in this regard, it can serve as an example. It is an \r\nexample that needs to be globally followed, where \r\napplicable. The question is who can be the agent \r\norganizing such international solidarity? The \r\nexperience of the past sixty years shows that there is \r\nonly one such organization, the one in which we are \r\ndebating today, the United Nations. \r\n But in order to achieve that objective, the United \r\nNations must be significantly reformed. Poland has \r\nconsistently advocated such reform. The main idea of \r\nthe reform consists of the simple adaptation of the \r\nstructure of the United Nations system to the \r\nfundamental changes in the political geography of the \r\nglobe over the past sixty-two years. This is intrinsically \r\nlinked to the reform of the Security Council.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to mention some \r\nexperiences of my country, similar to those of the \r\nCzech Republic, represented here today by Mr. Klaus. \r\nWe recently did away with Communism. Since then, \r\nwe have achieved economic success and, on the way, \r\nwe have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per \r\ncent. Therefore, we see that it is, indeed, feasible to do \r\nso. Despite apparent obstacles, the problem is not \r\ninsurmountable.  \r\n So, what methods can be applied? On the one \r\nhand, certain types of production should be stopped. \r\nOn the other hand, we can develop forestation of the \r\nland. In Poland and in other countries, this approach \r\ncan generate fantastic results. But, to achieve this, \r\nforests must be under general public control. I \r\nrepresent a country that operates on the basis of a \r\nmarket economy, but forests are a public resource. \r\n Some years ago, the problem area we are \r\ndiscussing today was one of the essential but not \r\npredominant issues. Today, it is a key subject in debate \r\nin the European Union. Today it is also a theme raised \r\nby the United Nations. I believe there are reasons \r\nbehind this. Therefore, this subject matter needs to be \r\npursued further. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Poland for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Norway \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nNorway. \r\n Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Stoltenberg (Norway): Two days ago, world \r\nleaders met here in this Hall and made strong \r\nstatements on the urgent need to address climate \r\nchange. We heard the Chairman of the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \r\nMr. Pachauri, present compelling evidence on the state \r\nof the world climate. He outlined a dire picture of the \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n33 07-51711 \r\n \r\nfuture state of the planet if strong and joint action is \r\nnot taken. We have no time to lose. \r\n It is imperative that we reach a comprehensive \r\npost-Kyoto agreement. The new agreement must be \r\nfirmly anchored in the United Nations, and it must \r\ninclude all major emitting countries and all major \r\nsectors. When we meet in Bali in December we should \r\nagree on the roadmap for the coming negotiations. \r\n The industrialized countries bear a special \r\nresponsibility for the current state of our atmosphere. \r\nTherefore, they must also take special responsibility \r\nfor bringing the global emissions of greenhouse gases \r\nback to a sustainable level. Our long-term goal should \r\nbe to avoid temperature increases above two degrees \r\nCelsius compared to the pre-industrial level. \r\n Meeting the challenge of climate change is within \r\nour reach. However, it requires that our response be \r\nstrong and coherent. We need to provide the worldwide \r\nprivate sector with strong incentives for cutting \r\nemissions. That is why it is essential to put a price on \r\ncarbon emissions and to expand the carbon market. \r\n Seven years ago, I was one of the 189 heads of \r\nState or Government who signed the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. We undertook a commitment to deliver on \r\nthe United Nations Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). However, unless we make an extra effort, we \r\nwill not fulfil the promises we made to the people of \r\nthe world. In particular, we are lagging behind in \r\nfulfilling the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\non child and maternal health. Every year almost ten \r\nmillion children die before the age of five. Many lives \r\ncan be saved using inexpensive and effective vaccines. \r\n Norway has contributed to the Global Alliance \r\nfor Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) since its \r\ninception in the year 2000. We have already managed \r\nto save more than two million lives through this \r\nalliance. But we need to move beyond vaccination.  \r\n Each year two million babies die before the sun \r\nsets on their first day of life. The four million \r\nnewborns who die in their first month might survive if \r\nthey were breastfed and had access to antibiotics and \r\nhealth workers. And not only newborns, but their \r\nmothers as well. Each year 500,000 women die in \r\nconnection with childbirth. Simple, affordable \r\nmeasures can save millions. \r\n Today Norway, together with other Governments, \r\nagencies and civil society, launched a global campaign \r\nto do precisely that: save millions of lives. The \r\ncampaign’s main thrusts are organizing and financing \r\nsurvival; ensuring that health personnel treat more \r\npatients and file fewer reports; and changing the \r\nfinancing mechanism so that treating patients becomes \r\na source of income rather than a cost for health \r\nsystems. Today we are launching an advocacy \r\ncampaign for women and children to ensure that our \r\nmessage will reach every corner of the world. I am also \r\npleased to announce that we are building a network of \r\nglobal leaders to oversee and ensure that the women \r\nand children will indeed be given priority. Today, let \r\nme also announce that Norway is pledging $1 billion \r\nover 10 years to support the Millennium Development \r\nGoals on child and maternal health.  \r\n The global campaign that we launched today, \r\nbuilds directly on the recommendations from the High-\r\nlevel Panel on System-wide Coherence, which I had \r\nthe privilege of chairing together with my colleagues \r\nfrom Pakistan and Mozambique. \r\n We need a strong and efficient United Nations; \r\nwe need a United Nations that delivers results; we need \r\na United Nations that delivers on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Addressing these challenges was \r\nthe mandate of the Panel. The Panel held meetings in \r\nmany parts of the world and listened to countries, \r\nregional groups, citizens groups, voluntary \r\norganizations and many individuals. In November last \r\nyear we presented our report (A/61/583) and \r\nrecommendations to the Secretary-General. They are \r\nan honest attempt to boost the Organization’s ability to \r\nlive up to its potential. At the heart of our report, we \r\nrecommend establishing “One United Nations” in each \r\ncountry: one leader, one programme, one budget and \r\none office, wherever feasible. Also — equally \r\nimportant for a better functioning United Nations: we \r\nneed a better focused management system at \r\nHeadquarters level. The Sustainable Development \r\nBoard aims at precisely that. \r\n The Panel set out with ambitions driven by a \r\nsense of responsibility, knowing that our most \r\nimportant constituency is not the United Nations itself, \r\nbut those millions of people who do not enjoy the \r\nprosperity and freedom that many of us take for \r\ngranted. Yet those people, whose life situation gave \r\nrise to the Millennium Development Goals, who right \r\nnow wonder how they will make it through the day — \r\nit is for the sake of those poor and destitute people that \r\nwe must have an efficient United Nations, one that is \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 34 \r\n \r\nwell governed and well funded and that will remain a \r\nglobal repository of hope. \r\n That is why we are under an obligation to take a \r\nfresh look at the way in which we have come to build a \r\nfragmented United Nations, one that risks being \r\nweakened, marginalized and less relevant. We have \r\nworked with the United Nations system to abolish \r\ndiseases, such as smallpox, and repressive regimes, \r\nsuch as apartheid. And we continue our struggle to \r\nabolish poverty, child mortality, torture and inhuman \r\nand degrading treatment — and to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n Today more and more people are breaking out of \r\npoverty. We have never had greater capacities to bridge \r\nthe gaps between us, but we cannot allow the \r\ninternational community to waste resources or to work \r\ntowards the Millennium Development Goals in \r\nanything but the most effective and rewarding ways. \r\nWe must focus our work, measure our results and show \r\nthat development, as organized by the United Nations, \r\npays high rewards. \r\n That is why we need to be open-minded, \r\nrecognizing that the most radical step we can take is to \r\ndo nothing. I am pleased to see the progress being \r\nmade in the eight pilot countries, where the “One \r\nUnited Nations” model is being implemented in \r\npractice. I am also pleased to see that these countries \r\nhave adopted different “One United Nations” processes \r\nand models that are tailored to each country’s specific \r\nsituation. This shows that there is no blueprint. \r\n United Nations funds and programmes operating \r\nin the field are already responding. Increasingly, we \r\nsee better coordination and stronger leadership. I \r\ncommend the United Nations bodies that have adopted \r\nthe new guiding principles, and I appeal to the others \r\nto follow suit.  \r\n The Panel’s report sets out a way forward. The \r\nUnited Nations has not broken down, but it requires \r\nmaintenance; therefore, the Panel did not propose \r\nrevolutionary changes. Rather, we put forward some \r\npractical, achievable and effective measures, building \r\non the thrust of decisions already made by Member \r\nStates. New gender architecture is urgently needed. I \r\nurge Member States to demonstrate the required vision \r\nand leadership. This will be an important task for this \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n Norway prides itself on being a friend of the \r\nUnited Nations. We support multilateral solutions to \r\ncommon problems, but a true friend does not refrain \r\nfrom speaking out when change and improvement are \r\nrequired. We believe in international development \r\ncooperation; we believe in a strong and efficient \r\nUnited Nations; therefore, we would like to reform the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway for the statement he has just \r\nmade.  \r\nMr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Malta \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMalta.  \r\nMr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Malta, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Gonzi (Malta): I would like, first of all, to \r\nextend my congratulations to you, Sir, on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. I am convinced that you will guide the \r\nGeneral Assembly through its important deliberations \r\nand challenges. I assure you of my full support and that \r\nof the Maltese delegation.  \r\n I also take this opportunity to express the \r\nappreciation of the Maltese delegation to the outgoing \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \r\nuntiring work in facilitating a constructive dialogue \r\namong all the United Nations Member States. \r\n Once again, the General Assembly is meeting to \r\nconsider and debate international issues that impact on \r\nthe heart and soul of the world populations. We are \r\nconcerned with the life and survival of those that do \r\nnot have a voice to cry out against the injustices, \r\nunderdevelopment, human rights violations, gender \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n35 07-51711 \r\n \r\ndiscrimination, poverty, child labour and \r\nenvironmental degradation. \r\n Malta applauds the efforts of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon who, since taking up his office, has \r\nvalidly been making a solid contribution towards a \r\nmore secure world, which is “our shared \r\nresponsibility”. \r\n The challenge of global climate change, \r\nparticularly of global warming, induces me to make a \r\nfew remarks about this environmental threat and its \r\nserious economic and social impacts which will impede \r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals. I \r\nam very proud of the fact that almost 20 years ago, in \r\n1988, my country, Malta, raised awareness about the \r\ngrave repercussions of climate change through an \r\ninitiative which led the General Assembly to declare \r\nthat “climate change is the common concern of \r\nmankind.” Eventually, that initiative led to the \r\nadoption of the Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and its Kyoto Protocol. \r\n I note with satisfaction the remarkable \r\nparticipation in last Monday’s high-level event. The \r\nSecretary-General was unequivocal in outlining the \r\nchallenge the world community is facing today. He \r\nsaid:  \r\n “Much has happened since those early days. \r\nBut the fundamental challenge remains \r\nunchanged, and has become even more pressing. \r\nIndeed, I am convinced that climate change, and \r\nwhat we do about it, will define us, our era, and \r\nultimately the global legacy we leave for future \r\ngenerations.” (Press release GA/10619) \r\n The disastrous effects on local populations that \r\nweather extremes are having as a result of global \r\nwarming, such as Hurricane Dean, which, the \r\nAssembly will recall, devastated the economies and \r\ninfrastructure of the island States of Dominica, Saint \r\nLucia, Jamaica, Martinique and Guadeloupe, and other \r\nsmall island States in the Pacific and the Caribbean. All \r\nof that requires the United Nations to strengthen its \r\nleadership in dealing with natural disasters. \r\n Malta believes that the issue of climate change \r\nand its repercussions must be addressed in a more \r\ncohesive and concerted manner among all the \r\ninternational institutions and organizations. It is \r\nimperative that all actors involved in climate risk \r\nreduction take a unified stand on a strategy and action \r\nto strengthen the resilience of affected countries in \r\nbuilding their ability to face and adapt to the adverse \r\nimpact of climate change. \r\n Malta also believes that the United Nations \r\nshould establish a mechanism through the General \r\nAssembly which will report on the activities in the \r\nfield of climate change throughout the past 20 years \r\nand propose elements of a possible future global \r\nstrategy which avoids the current fragmented approach \r\nand takes special account of the needs of small island \r\nStates. \r\n We owe such an effort to present and future \r\ngenerations. Malta looks forward to decisions at the \r\nBali summit next December that we are sure will orient \r\nand accelerate action within the United Nations \r\nframework to obtain agreement on a comprehensive, \r\neffective, fair and urgent global strategy to limit \r\nclimate change and adapt to its impacts. \r\n In a few weeks’ time, Malta together with the \r\ninternational community will be celebrating the fortieth \r\nanniversary of the initiative launched also by Malta on \r\nthe law of the sea, which, 15 years later, saw the \r\nadoption of the United Nations Convention, declaring \r\nthe seabed and its subsoil as the common heritage of \r\nmankind. Forty years after the launch of the Maltese \r\ninitiative and 25 years after the adoption of the 1982 \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we \r\ncan safely state that this concept could also be \r\nappropriately applied to the global environment, with \r\nthe knowledge that this priceless possession is owned \r\nby all human beings on this planet. The environment is \r\nour common area, our common heritage and as such it \r\nis our global concern. As States Members of the United \r\nNations, we must work together to ensure that this \r\nprecious possession is protected and enhanced. \r\n The maintenance of a special focus on furthering \r\ndialogue, peace, stability and prosperity in the \r\nMediterranean and the Middle East is one of the \r\nprimary objectives of Malta’s foreign policy. Together \r\nwith other European Union member States as well as \r\nwith our Mediterranean neighbours, Malta will \r\ncontinue to join in the calls for creating the necessary \r\nconditions for strengthening peace and cooperation in \r\nthe region. Malta’s participation in the Euro-\r\nMediterranean Barcelona Partnership, the Five plus \r\nFive Summit, the Mediterranean Forum, the Euro-Med \r\nParliamentary Assembly and the Parliamentary \r\nAssembly for the Mediterranean complement Malta’s \r\nA/62/PV.7  \r\n \r\n07-51711 36 \r\n \r\nlong-standing vocation and commitment to, and \r\nunderstanding of, the Mediterranean region. Malta is \r\nproud to host the headquarters of the newly established \r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean which \r\nwill meet for the first time in my country this \r\nNovember, launching a new dimension of discussions \r\non Mediterranean affairs. \r\n Close to Mediterranean affairs in the order of \r\npriorities is the Middle East, with the Palestinian \r\nquestion at its core. Malta intends to continue, as it has \r\ndone for many decades now, to support efforts to bring \r\nlasting peace in the Middle East. We find the economic \r\nand social repercussions on the living conditions of the \r\nPalestinian people worrisome. We remain concerned \r\nabout the security of the State of Israel and of the \r\nIsraeli people. We are troubled by the continuing \r\nviolence between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as \r\namong Palestinians, violence that continues to claim \r\ninnocent lives on both sides. Malta will persist in \r\nworking with the United Nations and the concerned \r\nparties for a two-State solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian question. Malta supports the decision of \r\nPrime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas \r\nto meet regularly in their quest for a durable and long-\r\nlasting solution. We also welcome the appointment of \r\nformer British Prime Minister Tony Blair as the special \r\nrepresentative of the Quartet and the initiative of \r\nPresident Bush to convene a major meeting on the \r\nissue in November of this year. \r\n A centrepiece of our Organization is the \r\nprotection of human rights worldwide. The Human \r\nRights Council’s first year of existence has witnessed \r\nthe successful conclusion of its institution-building \r\nprocess. Malta predicts that the universal periodic \r\nreview will become an effective and a proactive \r\nmechanism that not only provides an appraisal of \r\nMember States’ human rights records but also \r\nencourages further achievements. \r\n Malta welcomes the adoption of the United \r\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples by the General Assembly (resolution 61/295). \r\nLinked to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights is the right to life. It is Malta’s belief that the \r\nabolition of the death penalty would enhance respect \r\nfor the protection of the right to life. Malta also \r\ncommends and welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\ndecision to appoint a Special Adviser on the Prevention \r\nof Genocide with the “responsibility to protect” and \r\nwith an expanded mandate to cover cases of mass \r\natrocities. \r\n This year is the tenth anniversary of the Rome \r\nStatute which established the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Malta reiterates its full support and \r\ncommitment. My country intends to work with the \r\nUnited Nations and the States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, to ensure that the International Criminal Court \r\nstrengthens its tools in the administration of justice, \r\nreconciliation and the promotion of the rule of law and \r\ndemocracy. \r\n Two weeks ago, the international community \r\njoined the people of the City of New York to \r\ncommemorate the sixth anniversary of the terrorist \r\nattack on the World Trade Centre. While grieving with \r\nthose who have lost their loved ones and with all the \r\npeople of the United States, we reaffirm our \r\ncommitment with States Members of the United \r\nNations in the fight against terrorism. The completion \r\nof negotiations on a United Nations comprehensive \r\nconvention against international terrorism would \r\ncomplement and strengthen the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and the Secretary-General’s \r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee Implementation Task \r\nForce in addressing the threat of terrorism to global \r\npeace and security. \r\n Allow me to touch on another subject. The plight \r\nof internally displaced persons and those who are \r\nseeking a better life elsewhere has continued to be one \r\nof the priority issues of the international community. \r\nIndeed, Malta has for some time now been witnessing \r\nthat tragic human migration, caused primarily by \r\ninternal conflicts, poverty and underdevelopment, and \r\nresulting in a large influx of asylum seekers arriving \r\nirregularly on our small island State, which, at 1,200 \r\npersons per square kilometre, has one of the highest \r\npopulation densities in the world. The impact on us is \r\ntherefore enormous. \r\n I would like to reiterate the calls made by Malta \r\nin this same Assembly last year for a concerted \r\nresponse from the international community, as well as \r\nfrom the United Nations, its institutions and \r\norganizations, particularly the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, in \r\naddressing the problem appropriately and adequately. \r\nThe response should be undertaken particularly by \r\ncombating the criminal organizations that are \r\nfinancially benefiting from illegal immigration while \r\n A/62/PV.7\r\n \r\n37 07-51711 \r\n \r\nthey put the lives of those same immigrants at risk, and \r\nby providing special assistance to those countries \r\nwhich, like Malta, carry a disproportionate burden in \r\naddressing the phenomenon. \r\n Malta hopes that the High-Level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development held last year \r\nand the follow-up meetings will continue to find \r\nsupport in establishing a comprehensive institutional \r\nand holistic response to international migration and \r\nsolutions that I hope will be based on the values of \r\nsolidarity, on respect for human dignity, and on the \r\nsharing of responsibility. \r\n In a month’s time, the United Nations will be \r\nhosting the High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment with a view to reviewing the six areas of \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus. The detailed report of the \r\nSecretary-General recommends a series of policies for \r\naction by United Nations Member States and other \r\nstakeholders in advancing and consolidating economic \r\ngrowth, sustainable development, and social progress. \r\nAs rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General,  \r\n“The Monterrey Consensus embodies a major \r\ncommitment … to keeping fully engaged at all \r\nlevels … and to continuing to build bridges \r\namong development, finance and trade \r\norganizations and initiatives” (A/62/217, \r\npara. 127). \r\n In that context, the roles of the International \r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank are crucial. In \r\naddition, the conclusion of negotiations on the Doha \r\ndevelopment agenda would significantly contribute to \r\nthe sustainable development of developing countries. \r\n In order to ensure that the United Nations is \r\nbetter equipped to accomplish the mission and \r\n \r\nmandates given to it by its principal organs, the \r\nongoing process of reform has to be accelerated. The \r\nWorld Summit in 2005 agreed on a number of reforms, \r\nand especially on the need to restructure the main \r\nUnited Nations bodies, including the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecurity Council. Progress has been made, but, I \r\nsubmit, more progress has still to be achieved. Malta is \r\nan advocate of a stronger United Nations that is \r\nrepresentative of the whole membership, transparent in \r\nits role and actions, and accountable, efficient and \r\neffective in its management. \r\n It is also in that context that Malta strongly \r\nsupports efforts to strengthen the system-wide \r\ncoherence of the United Nations operational \r\ndevelopment activities. The reform of the United \r\nNations and the proposed establishment of the “One \r\nUnited Nations” country approach are, in Malta’s view, \r\ntwo important pillars on which our Organization can \r\nappropriately address the new and growing challenges \r\nit is facing. Member States must give the United \r\nNations a new face, a stronger meaning and an \r\ninnovative way of thinking, implementing and acting. \r\n The United Nations, our Organization, must be \r\ngiven the ability to respond, the capacity to effectively \r\ncoordinate and deliver, and the means to truly reflect \r\nthe aspirations of its whole membership. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Malta for the statement he has just made. \r\n The Honourable Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n  The meeting rose at 7.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
