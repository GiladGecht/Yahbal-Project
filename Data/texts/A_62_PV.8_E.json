(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda. \r\n Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Rwanda, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Kagame: May I start by expressing to \r\nyou, Mr. President, my Government’s congratulations \r\non your election as the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session. \r\n Let me also use this occasion to thank the \r\noutgoing President, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \r\nfor the excellent manner in which she presided over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. \r\n Every year the General Assembly provides the \r\nworld’s leaders with an excellent opportunity to focus \r\nour attention on the challenges we commonly face. \r\nWhile some of the challenges can be addressed \r\nnationally, the most critical are often not confined to \r\nnational borders and therefore require a concerted \r\nglobal effort. Hence the centrality of the United \r\nNations in providing the leadership and platform to \r\naddress global challenges. \r\n That is why it is vital that the United Nations \r\ncontinues to undergo comprehensive reforms to render \r\nit more versatile, effective and efficient. As the \r\nSecretary-General correctly observed in his report on \r\nthis subject, the United Nations is “not optimally \r\nconfigured”. \r\n Some of the ongoing reforms such as the \r\nimplementation of “one programme, one budgetary \r\nframework and one office” at the country level is a \r\ngood start for rendering this international body more \r\nresponsive. We are pleased that Rwanda was selected \r\nas one of the eight first pilot countries for this reform.  \r\n In the same context of the ongoing reforms, the \r\nproposal to restructure the gender portfolio is most \r\nwelcome. We agree with the findings of the High-level \r\nPanel that the United Nations contributions to gender \r\nissues have been incoherent, under-resourced and \r\nfragmented. The proposed reforms will assist in \r\novercoming those shortcomings. \r\n However, we still eagerly await the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council to render it more representative of the \r\nworld community and more transparent in its \r\noperations and decision-making processes. We believe \r\nthat this would equip the United Nations with greater \r\nlegitimacy and capacity to maintain world peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Let me briefly touch on a number of pressing \r\nchallenges the global community currently faces. \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 2 \r\n \r\nWhile our continent has been consolidating peace and \r\nsecurity, there are persistent problem areas that need \r\nattention. Today in the Great Lakes region, those who \r\ncommitted genocide in Rwanda in 1994 continue their \r\ndestructive activities. Almost 14 years after their deeds \r\nin our country, they are still sowing mayhem in the \r\nregion. They rape, murder, terrorize and plunder with \r\nimpunity. Their leaders are active in Africa, Europe, \r\nAmerica and other places, where they continue to \r\npromote the ideology of genocide. There can be no \r\ndoubt that those terror groups constitute a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. The presence of the \r\ncostly United Nations peacekeeping mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has not diminished \r\ntheir activities. \r\n I once again call upon the international \r\ncommunity, in collaboration with the Government of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, to end the \r\nthreat posed by those negative forces once and for all. \r\nRwandans and the region as a whole need peace and \r\nstability so that we can concentrate on the business of \r\neconomic growth and development. \r\n For our part, we pledge renewed commitment to \r\nmaking our contribution to the restoration of peace and \r\nstability in the Great Lakes region and in other parts of \r\nour continent. In that respect, we express our solidarity \r\nwith the long-suffering people of Darfur and commit \r\nourselves to contributing to peace efforts in that part of \r\nthe world, in close cooperation with the Government of \r\nthe Sudan, the African Union (AU) and the United \r\nNations. Rwanda welcomes Security Council \r\nresolution 1769 (2007) authorizing the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations-AU hybrid peacekeeping force in \r\nDarfur, and calls for its speedy deployment. In the \r\nsame spirit, we urge the international community to \r\nsupport peacebuilding efforts in Somalia. It is critical \r\nthat resources be made available on an urgent basis to \r\nenable the deployment of the pledged peacekeeping \r\nforces by African countries. \r\n Through the United Nations, we express our \r\ncollective determination to promote socioeconomic \r\ntransformation for greater and more rapid wealth \r\ncreation, which in turn will permit improved lives. On \r\nthat note, we also join the many other countries that are \r\nputting forward the suggestion of a moratorium on the \r\ndeath penalty as a way of improving those lives and \r\nvaluing them. That challenge remains daunting in the \r\ndeveloping world, where extreme poverty still affects \r\nmillions of people. \r\n The solutions include increased productive \r\ncapacities on the part of the developing world, side by \r\nside with the opening of global markets to the \r\ndeveloped world to permit greater trade and \r\ninvestment. A fair global trading system is central to \r\nwealth creation. Improving the quality of development \r\naid would supplement that effort, based on a shared \r\nunderstanding that aid is most effective when it is \r\naligned with national development priorities. \r\n Our ultimate goal of improving lives globally \r\ncannot be realized if the challenge of climate change \r\nand the associated widespread environmental \r\ndegradation is not sufficiently tackled. Rwanda \r\nappreciates the convening of the high-level meeting on \r\nclimate change by the Secretary-General earlier this \r\nweek. We also look forward to the United Nations \r\nclimate change conference scheduled to take place in \r\nBali, Indonesia, this December, which should provide a \r\nclear road map of how we are to consolidate our gains \r\nand gather pace in protecting our environment. \r\n The global challenges of poverty, ignorance, \r\nterrorism, conflict and climate change require us to act \r\ncollectively in a manner that the founders of this \r\nOrganization captured eloquently in the words “We the \r\npeoples of the United Nations”. As we begin this sixty-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly, let us \r\nrecommit to our common aspirations and \r\nresponsibilities for realizing peace, prosperity and \r\nfreedom above any narrow interests. Only then can we \r\nhope to realize the ideals contained in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations “to save succeeding generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war” and to “promote social \r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom”. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Rwanda for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic \r\nof Croatia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Croatia. \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n3 07-51956 \r\n \r\n Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President \r\nof the Republic of Croatia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Mesić (spoke in Croatian; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): When I first took the floor \r\nseven years ago to address the representatives of the \r\nStates of the world on behalf of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, I started off with the words “time is running \r\nout”. At the time, I did not even imagine that I would \r\nhave to repeat those very words seven years later, but \r\nwith a greater sense of urgency. However, current \r\ncircumstances, the problems facing us and our inability \r\nor inadequate ability to deal with them compel me to \r\nrepeat, here and now: Time is running out. \r\n When we attended the millennial session marking \r\nthe beginning of the new century and the new \r\nmillennium, we also formulated our millennial goals. \r\nQuite appropriately, we identified our tasks and our \r\naspirations. However, what is not appropriate is the \r\nfact that the implementation of the Millennial Goals is \r\nnot proceeding at the proper rate or in the proper \r\nmanner if we want them to be meaningful. \r\n We are running late; hence my warning: Time is \r\nrunning out. Among all global organizations, the \r\nUnited Nations is that which has been most \r\nsympathetic to the problems of developing countries \r\nand where loud and justified requests have been voiced \r\nto stop the stratification of the world into the haves and \r\nthe have-nots. I have also attended sessions and \r\nconferences dealing with the issue, and I have \r\nrepeatedly drawn attention to underdevelopment as a \r\ngenerator of global terrorism, along with inequality in \r\ninternational relations and unresolved regional crises. \r\nNevertheless, underdevelopment and poverty still \r\nweigh upon a substantial part of humankind, and the \r\npreferred methods for fighting terrorism have so far \r\nbeen shown to be less than efficient, and sometimes \r\neven counterproductive. We are also running late in \r\nthat regard, and time is running out here, too. \r\n We have wanted and still want this Organization, \r\nour own Organization, to be fit for better and more \r\nfunctional action in current conditions. In other words, \r\nwe want to reform the United Nations; we want to \r\ntransform the Organization from a reflection of a world \r\nlong gone into an instrument for safeguarding peace, \r\nestablishing stability and ensuring development in the \r\ncontemporary world and the world of future \r\ngenerations.  \r\n By declaring its candidacy for a non-permanent \r\nseat in the Security Council, Croatia wishes to affirm \r\nits commitment to the global Organization and its \r\nreadiness to take part in its reform. I do not want to \r\nmisuse the time at my disposal to lobby for that \r\ncandidacy. Our deeds say more than our words, and our \r\ndeeds include a successful struggle for national \r\nindependence, despite an imposed war; the peaceful \r\ncompletion of that struggle through cooperation with \r\nthe United Nations; a courageous confrontation of the \r\npast and of the truth about that past; the establishment \r\nof good relations with all our neighbours, including \r\nthose that waged war against us; the promotion of the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts, always and \r\neverywhere; current participation in 15 United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions, which puts Croatia at the very \r\ntop of those countries whose soldiers are today \r\nmaintaining peace under the blue flag. Let me \r\nemphasize that they are participating only in those \r\nmissions that are under a United Nations mandate. In \r\nshort, we are putting forward our candidacy as a \r\nmature European democratic country committed to the \r\ngoals of the United Nations, and there is nothing more \r\nto be said about it. \r\n As I have already said, we demonstrate our \r\ncommitment by supporting the reform of the world \r\nOrganization, but even in the realization of that noble \r\nand certainly unavoidable goal we are running late. \r\nEven among us, there are voices suggesting that we \r\nrenounce the United Nations. There is less and less \r\ntime for action. Even in that context, then, I must \r\nreiterate: Time is running out. \r\n In recent decades, this Hall has heard many \r\ndebates on the need to establish new political and \r\neconomic international relations. Such new relations \r\ncan be based only on equality. It is true that the high \r\nand the mighty have a greater responsibility, but it is \r\nalso true that no one — no one at all — can or may \r\nhave greater rights, much less usurp such rights by \r\nforce, just as nobody’s rights can be denied by force. \r\nThat holds true for global and regional developments \r\nalike. Unfortunately, force is still present in \r\ninternational relations, and on the European continent \r\nwe are witnessing dangerous signs of a possible \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 4 \r\n \r\nrenewal of the arms race. Such a trend should be \r\nstopped and such conditions changed. There is not \r\nmuch time. Once again, time is running out. \r\n By complying with the requirements of often \r\nuncontrolled development — and not only in the most \r\ndeveloped countries — and by giving in to the \r\naggressive needs of capital, guided exclusively by \r\ninterest and never by social factors, we have agreed to \r\ncondemn millions of people to death by starvation and \r\nfor lack of basic medical care, and hundreds of \r\nmillions to bare survival in poverty, with no prospects. \r\nHowever, by destroying nature, we have also \r\njeopardized everyone’s survival. Climate change and \r\nglobal warming are only two indicators, albeit the most \r\nevident, of the situation to which I am referring. The \r\nsummit on climate change proved that we are all aware \r\nof the danger we are facing. Those who underestimate \r\nand even deny that real danger will simply have to face \r\nthe truth. We are already living that truth; fast, \r\ncoordinated and responsible action is called for. That \r\naction must serve the interests of all, even if it may \r\nmomentarily run against the interests of some, because \r\ntime is running out dangerously. \r\n We have not met yet again in the General \r\nAssembly in order to describe our world and our \r\nenvironment from our individual perspectives. Our \r\nmandate is not mere diagnosis. Our mandate involves \r\nhealing, changing and improving. With a foreign policy \r\nbased on the value of the European Union, which it \r\nwill enter soon, and with its desire to develop good \r\nrelations with everyone willing to reciprocate, the \r\nRepublic of Croatia has shown by deeds that it is aware \r\nof the fact that there is no time to be lost. It has also \r\nshown the capacity to act and to get things going in a \r\npositive direction, both in its own interest and in that of \r\nothers. \r\n We have only one world. Its destiny is in our \r\nhands. There is room for everyone in this world, but \r\nthis world can, may and must be only a world of \r\nequals, of people enjoying not only equal rights but \r\nalso equal opportunities, knowing that nobody, \r\nhowever big and strong, can live alone and only for his \r\nown sake, and that together we can change our world. \r\nEven more importantly, however, together we can save \r\nand preserve it for future generations. But let us not \r\nforget: time is running out. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Croatia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Serbia. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Boris Tadić, President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Tadić (spoke in Serbian; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): I welcome the opportunity \r\nto address, on behalf of the Republic of Serbia, the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations, the highest \r\nbody of the world family of sovereign nations. \r\n I congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on \r\nhis election to his very responsible post. I also \r\ncongratulate the newly elected President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. Srdjan Kerim, who hails from our \r\nregion of South-East Europe. \r\n Serbia attaches exceptional importance to the role \r\nthat the world Organization, and the Security Council \r\nin particular, play in maintaining international peace \r\nand security and in safeguarding the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of the Member States. Proceeding \r\nfrom the Charter of the United Nations as the \r\ncornerstone of the current international legal order, \r\nSerbia calls for its consistent implementation. \r\n The sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly is taking place at a very important moment \r\nfor Serbia as the negotiation process on the future \r\nstatus of its province of Kosovo and Metohija is under \r\nway. Proceeding from the firm position that the \r\nindependence of Kosovo is unacceptable to Serbia, we \r\nhave offered special rights and competences to Kosovo \r\nAlbanians for the autonomous development of their \r\ncommunity within the Republic of Serbia. \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n5 07-51956 \r\n \r\n In defence of the State sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Serbia, our negotiating team has offered a \r\ndecentralization model based on European solutions \r\nthat would protect the interests of Kosovo Albanians, \r\nas well as the threatened interests of the Serbian and \r\nother non-Albanian ethnic communities in the \r\nprovince, in an effective way. Serbia offers solutions \r\nthat would definitively solve, through mutual \r\nagreement and with the implementation of European \r\nvalues and rules, an old inter-ethnic conflict and open \r\nthe prospects of reconciliation and coexistence within a \r\nmodern, democratic and European Serbia. My country \r\nis ready to compromise, yet we wish to point out that \r\nthe legitimate interests of democratic Serbia and the \r\nspecific needs of the threatened Serbian community in \r\nthe province, as well as of other communities that have \r\nfallen victim to expulsion, such as the Roma and \r\nGorani communities, must be respected. Let me recall \r\nthat more than 200,000 Serbs have left Kosovo since \r\n1999; to date, according to the official data of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, only \r\n7,100 have returned. \r\n Today, negotiations are under way under the \r\nauspices of the Contact Group, but a legitimate \r\ndecision on the future status of Kosovo can be taken \r\nonly by the Security Council. Only a decision taken by \r\nthat institution can be based on international law. \r\n Persistent in our request that the territorial \r\nintegrity of the Republic of Serbia be respected, we \r\ncall for the attainment of a compromise solution \r\nthrough diplomatic, legal and peaceful means, and not \r\nthrough war and violence. It is precisely for those \r\nreasons that democratic Serbia does not accept that the \r\nthreat of violence made by the party we are negotiating \r\nwith is an argument for redrawing the borders of \r\nlegitimate democracies and for violating the norms of \r\ninternational law. My country is therefore steadfast in \r\nwarning of the unforeseeable consequences of that \r\nunprincipled and dangerous policy, and remains \r\ncommitted to the search for a peaceful and compromise \r\nsolution through dialogue and in full respect for the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n Serbia would also like to recall that threats have \r\nbeen bandied about of late that the Kosovo Provisional \r\nInstitutions will unilaterally declare independence on \r\n11 December. We point that out because of the fact that \r\nthe international legal order would never be the same \r\nfollowing a one-sided recognition of Kosovo’s \r\nindependence, while many separatist movements the \r\nworld over would exploit the newly established \r\nprecedent. Many regions in the world would thereby be \r\ndestabilized. We therefore call on the legitimate \r\nrepresentatives of the Kosovo Albanians to proceed to \r\nthe resumed negotiations without prejudging the \r\noutcome, so that a compromise solution acceptable to \r\nboth parties can be achieved, leading to long-term \r\nSerbian/Albanian reconciliation. \r\n This year, Serbia is presiding over the Committee \r\nof Ministers of the Council of Europe. In that capacity, \r\nwe have made every effort to make a maximum \r\ncontribution to the strengthening of democracy, the \r\nprotection of human rights and the rule of law — the \r\nbasic values of the oldest pan-European organization. \r\nWe have also sought to strengthen synergy between the \r\nCouncil of Europe and the United Nations, especially \r\nin the field of human rights. \r\n It is in the strategic interest of Serbia to become a \r\nmember of the European Union. We are working hard \r\nto become a candidate member by the end of 2008. We \r\nare engaged in the process of Euro-Atlantic integration \r\nthrough the Partnership for Peace programme. We have \r\nthereby clearly evinced our acceptance of European \r\nvalues and our readiness to develop our country in \r\naccordance with the highest European standards. \r\n We are convinced that the European perspective \r\non the entire Western Balkans is the most effective way \r\nto stabilize the situation and accelerate the \r\ndevelopment of all countries in the region. Only thus \r\nshall we overcome the problems inherited from the past \r\nand encourage a spirit of tolerance and commitment to \r\nthe same goals and values, which will provide a basis \r\nfor building stable and lasting peace in our region. \r\n Unfortunately, the question of war crimes \r\ncontinues to burden relations among Balkan countries. \r\nFor its part, Serbia has done everything within its \r\npower to track down, arrest and transfer to The Hague \r\nthose accused of war crimes, thereby demonstrating its \r\ncommitment to cooperating with the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to a \r\nsuccessful end. That is not only Serbia’s international \r\nobligation; above all, it is our debt to ourselves and to \r\nour neighbours. By punishing criminals and building a \r\nstable and prosperous region, a common space \r\nintegrated into the European Union, we can ensure a \r\nbetter future for all citizens. \r\n It is with pleasure and optimism that we note that, \r\nstep by step, South-East Europe is becoming a region \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 6 \r\n \r\nof good-neighbourliness and cooperation. There are \r\nnumerous examples of very successful initiatives and \r\nconcrete forms of cooperation, the contribution of \r\nwhich to the promotion of peace and mutual trust is \r\nexceptionally important. There is hardly any field in \r\nwhich we have not yet established a mechanism of \r\nmutual cooperation. That proves unequivocally that \r\nthis is a lasting, strategic orientation of all countries in \r\nthe Balkans and a reflection of their common \r\naspiration to the full inclusion of our region into \r\nEuropean integration. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Global problems call for global answers, and all \r\nMember States are therefore required to participate \r\nactively in their solution. Today, as we face completely \r\nnew and specific challenges that threaten international \r\npeace and security and pose a threat to overall \r\ndevelopment and prosperity, we are becoming \r\nincreasingly aware of the great need — perhaps greater \r\nthan ever before — for the United Nations. \r\n Terrorism is one of the greatest scourges of the \r\npresent-day world. In order to fight and eradicate it \r\neffectively, we must take a global, coordinated \r\napproach, as well as vigorous action at the regional and \r\ncountry levels. Last year, Serbia hosted the regional \r\nsummit meeting on terrorism, organized crime and \r\ncorruption. \r\n As can be seen, we cooperate very closely with \r\nour neighbours in order to forestall threats. An \r\nexcellent example of that cooperation was the recent \r\njoint exercise of the armies of Serbia, Romania and \r\nBulgaria, which provided abundant evidence of our \r\nthree countries’ collective readiness to combat \r\nterrorism and any other threat to the security of our \r\ncitizens. Serbia also initiated the signing of an \r\nagreement with neighbouring countries on cooperation \r\nin the protection against natural disasters. The recent \r\ncatastrophic fires that engulfed Greece and the manner \r\nin which we reacted provided eloquent proof of the \r\nvital importance of mutual dependence and solidarity \r\nin the Balkan region. \r\n Numerous crises continue to plague the world. \r\nSome are dormant, some are escalating, while others \r\nthreaten to provoke conflicts that could engender \r\ndangerous consequences, destruction and humanitarian \r\ncatastrophes. Our experience to date makes us believe \r\neven more firmly that lasting, just and stable peace and \r\nsecurity can be achieved only peacefully, through \r\ndialogue, mutual respect and cooperation. \r\n Serbia believes that the United Nations continues \r\nto be an irreplaceable international authority and \r\nmechanism for the prevention of crises and the \r\nresolution of conflicts. Successful and timely \r\ndeployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces is \r\nan important aspect of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. We support the efforts of the \r\nOrganization to further strengthen the efficiency of its \r\npeacekeeping capacities. Serbia therefore considers \r\nthat only gathered together around common goals and \r\nobjectives and united in action can we make a vigorous \r\nstand against such global threats to international peace \r\nand security as terrorism, bellicose extremism, mass \r\npoverty, organized crime, pandemic diseases and the \r\nharmful consequences of climate change. \r\n Global warming is surely a major problem of our \r\nage and rightly figures as one of the central topics on \r\nthe agenda of the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly. That phenomenon — which, arguably, may \r\naffect all humankind — knows no national borders and \r\ncircumvents no part of the world. To solve it, therefore, \r\nwe must address it very seriously, as it brooks no delay \r\nand all Member States must get on board. Within the \r\nBelgrade Initiative, Serbia has proposed that activities \r\nto stop global warming be carried out also at the \r\nregional level and that a regional centre for South-East \r\nEurope be set up in Belgrade to that end. We also \r\nemphasize that plans to reduce harmful emissions must \r\ntake into consideration the level of the economic \r\ndevelopment of various countries as well. \r\n The complex of relations among different \r\ncultures, civilizations and religions is also a question \r\nthat deserves to be at the focus of the attention of the \r\nUnited Nations. A truly multi-ethnic, multi-\r\nconfessional and multi-cultural country, Serbia fully \r\nunderstands all the sensitivity of those questions and \r\ntreats them with due attention. We are well aware that \r\nthe world of the twenty-first century must not be based \r\non intolerance on any ground. We, the leaders of the \r\nUnited Nations Member States, are entrusted with a \r\ngreat responsibility to make every effort to ensure that \r\nall the diversity of this world be comprehended and \r\naccepted as the wealth of all, rather than as the cause \r\nof new divisions. Indeed, dialogue and mutual \r\ntolerance must prevail as the basic principles of our \r\nmutual relations, both within States and internationally. \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n7 07-51956 \r\n \r\n As a responsible member of the world community \r\nand international organizations, Serbia fully respects \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the international \r\nlegal order established by the Charter. Building a truly \r\ndemocratic society in our own country, we call for the \r\ndemocratization of international relations on the basis \r\nof the strict implementation of the Charter and other \r\ngenerally accepted norms and standards. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We firmly believe that only equitable cooperation \r\namong countries and peoples, respect for basic human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, and mutual trust can \r\nguarantee stable international peace and security. At \r\nthe same time, short of the political stability and \r\neconomic prosperity of States, there is no successful \r\ncooperation at the bilateral, regional and global levels. \r\nThe precondition for stability and dynamic economic \r\ndevelopment is equal access to new technologies and \r\nmodern scientific achievements. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The Republic Serbia is willing and ready, \r\nalongside other countries, to be actively involved in the \r\nprocess of United Nations reform and revitalization in \r\norder to make the world Organization capable of \r\neffectively facing the challenges of our times. Our \r\nhistoric responsibility is to ensure future generations a \r\nmuch better environment than that in which we live \r\ntoday. The Republic of Serbia remains devoted to \r\nachieving the goals of the United Nations and, along \r\nwith other countries, is ready to work on further \r\nstrengthening the integrity of the world Organization \r\nunder its Charter. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Serbia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Colombia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of \r\nColombia. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Uribe Vélez (spoke in Spanish): Allow \r\nme to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to wish him the \r\ngreatest success in his work. \r\n After five years in office, we come to the General \r\nAssembly once again to inform members on issues \r\ncrucial to Colombian democracy. \r\n We have rejected the dismantling of the State and \r\nrefuse to enter into a statism that would wither private \r\ninitiative. We have reformed 420 State entities and are \r\ndetermined to work to that end until the last day of our \r\nGovernment. We seek a more efficient State at the \r\nservice of the community and not owned by political \r\nmachinations, union excesses or interest groups. \r\n We are committed to the development of an \r\nentrepreneurial society, in opposition to State or private \r\nmonopolies, in a nation with a consensus centred on \r\nproductivity, discipline and equity. We provide every \r\nspace for private initiative with social responsibility, \r\nwhich must be expressed in the transparency of \r\nrelations between investors and the State, in \r\nentrepreneurial solidarity with the community beyond \r\nthe legal minimums, and in labour relations framed by \r\nfraternity, contrary to savage capitalism and class \r\nstruggle. \r\n In sectors such as electricity, metallurgy and \r\nhealth, we have encouraged participatory trade \r\nunionism, with simultaneous responsibility in the \r\nsocial field and entrepreneurial management, distinct \r\nfrom traditional entitlement organization. We have \r\nincreased by 40 per cent the affiliation of workers to \r\nsocial security through the improved performance of \r\nthe economy and our fight against evasion. In the past \r\nfive years, the minimum wage has grown by 8 per cent \r\nabove inflation. Our per capita income has gone from \r\n$1,851 to $3,517. After adjustment in terms of \r\npurchasing power, it has increased from $6,468 to \r\n$9,456. For the first time in decades, the Gini \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 8 \r\n \r\ncoefficient of income distribution has started to \r\nimprove. \r\n From the first day of my Government, with our \r\ndemocratic security policy we made the decision not to \r\ntolerate the murder of any Colombian and to defeat \r\nimpunity. The security situation has improved \r\nsubstantially. In 2002, Colombia suffered 29,000 \r\nhomicides, of which 196 were perpetrated against trade \r\nunionists, and we closed 2006 with a 40 per cent \r\nreduction in general violence and a 70 per cent \r\nreduction in violence against trade unionists. This year, \r\nthere are 6,714 Colombians with individual protection \r\nfrom the State, of which almost 1,200 are workers \r\nbelonging to trade unions, at a budgetary cost of almost \r\n$39 million. \r\n In our struggle against impunity, between the \r\nbudgets for 2002 and 2008 we will have increased the \r\nresources for the judicial branch and for the Attorney \r\nGeneral’s office by 76 per cent and 78 per cent, \r\nrespectively. The budget for the special unit of the \r\nAttorney General’s office devoted to cases of the \r\nmurder of trade unionists has increased by 40 per cent. \r\nThe unit oversees more than 300 cases prioritized by \r\ntrade union movements. \r\n The fight against impunity for the murder of \r\nunionized workers is being carried out under the \r\nguidelines of the International Labour Organization \r\n(ILO), in agreement between Government, workers and \r\nemployers. Reports on the progress made, submitted by \r\nthe ILO office in Colombia, have been positive. \r\n Allow me to affirm before the United Nations \r\nthat murders and kidnappings have been the work of \r\nterrorists. First, it was the Marxist guerrillas who, in \r\nintroducing their perverse scheme of a so-called \r\ncombination of all forms of struggle, murdered, \r\nkidnapped and penetrated sectors of workers, students, \r\npoliticians and journalists. Then came the \r\nparamilitaries, and they did the same, murdering \r\nworkers and accusing them of collaborating with the \r\nguerrillas, which in reciprocity murdered those whom \r\nthey believed to be friends with the paramilitaries. In \r\ncertain parts of the country, the confrontation between \r\nthe two guerrilla factions that still exist leads to the \r\nmurder of workers. \r\n Overcoming that scourge once and for all is an \r\ninalienable objective of our democratic security policy. \r\nIn that regard, our three Government objectives are to \r\nconsolidate democratic security, strengthen investor \r\nconfidence, and achieve our social programme, which \r\nis more ambitious than the millennium social goals that \r\nwe hope to meet before the date set by the United \r\nNations. \r\n With regard to democratic security, we are \r\nwinning, but we have not won yet. With persistence \r\nand transparency, Colombia will overcome terrorism \r\nfinanced by illicit drugs. We have a long-lived, \r\nrespectable and ever-deepening democracy. We are \r\napproaching the fifth electoral contest presided over by \r\nmy Government, and the transparency and \r\neffectiveness of the guarantees offered to all \r\ncontenders are increasingly evident. There are 86,347 \r\nregistered candidates of 235 different political origins \r\nto fill 18,332 posts by direct election. This is \r\nhappening in a country that, five years ago, was facing \r\n60,000 terrorists, and where about 11,000 still remain. \r\nTo fight them, we deepen democracy instead of \r\nrestricting it, protect liberties instead of suppressing \r\nthem, and stimulate dissent instead of silencing it. Our \r\nfight against terrorism is being observed by national \r\nand international critics, who can be in the country and \r\nsay what they please without restriction. \r\n Our democratic practice gives us the political \r\nauthority to say that those who take up arms financed \r\nby illicit drugs are not insurgents against oppression \r\nbut terrorists against liberty. We will not refuse to \r\nnegotiate with them if they cease their violent actions, \r\nbut we will not allow for negotiation to become a trap \r\nthat enables the destruction of our democracy. We have \r\nachieved the demobilization of 46,000 members of \r\ndifferent factions and we are carrying out a costly and \r\ncomplex reintegration process with them that requires \r\ntruth, justice and redress for the victims. \r\n Thus, I now turn to the humanitarian agreement \r\nto free kidnapped people being held by terrorists of the \r\nFuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia — \r\nEjército del Pueblo (FARC). Most of those were \r\nkidnapped before or during the time of the Caguan \r\ndemilitarized zone, which lasted 42 months. We do not \r\nunderstand why FARC should ask for a demilitarized \r\nzone to release the kidnapped when it had that option \r\nfor so long and did not free them. The country was \r\nwithout law and order for many years, and with no \r\nsecurity, which allowed its almost complete takeover \r\nby guerrillas and paramilitaries. Citizens do not want \r\nterrorists; they plead for the exclusive presence of the \r\nState in all regions. We are open to a humanitarian \r\nagreement, but we cannot allow demilitarized zones, \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n9 07-51956 \r\n \r\nwhich are ultimately concentration camps run by \r\nterrorists, nor can we permit those who are released \r\nfrom prison to return to crime, since it would be an \r\naffront to the sacrifice of the country’s soldiers and \r\npolice. \r\n We have unilaterally freed 177 FARC members, \r\nas well as Rodrigo Granda, a high-ranking member of \r\nthat organization, who was freed at the request of the \r\nPresident of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. We have given \r\nour consent for many people and institutions to be \r\nfacilitators. The only answer from the terrorists has \r\nbeen the treacherous murder of 11 assemblymen from \r\nValle del Cauca, who were held hostage for more than \r\nfive years, and the ongoing assassinations of defenders \r\nof democracy, such as those perpetrated last Saturday, \r\nin which the victim was Julio César Marentes and \r\nAlberto Martínez Barbosa, two candidates for mayor in \r\nVillarrica and Río Blanco, Department of Tolima, and \r\nmembers of a political party from the Government’s \r\ncoalition. \r\n The options open for the release of kidnapping \r\nvictims — including a French female citizen who is \r\nalso Colombian, and three American citizens — are not \r\noptions for the political positioning of terrorism. \r\nColombia will not permit the recovery of its legitimate \r\nand democratic sovereignty to be frustrated by \r\nrestoring national or international space to the \r\nmurdering power of terrorism. If terrorists want to be \r\ninvolved in politics, they have to renounce their bloody \r\nactivities and submit to the Constitution. \r\n Recently, the Government gave its permission to \r\nSenator Piedad Córdoba, who is in the opposition to \r\nthe Government, to play a role as facilitator of the \r\nhumanitarian agreement. We also accepted the help of \r\nPresident Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who will meet \r\nshortly with representatives of FARC. President \r\nChávez has invited some congressmen from the United \r\nStates to join him at that meeting, with my \r\nGovernment’s support and suggestion that the \r\nAmerican delegation be bipartisan so as to preserve a \r\nbipartisan approach in its relations with Colombia. We \r\ncelebrate the positive willingness of the Government of \r\nthe United States. \r\n We have established certain reservations in order \r\nto defend our democracy’s higher interests, and we \r\nencourage both President Chávez and Senator Piedad \r\nCórdoba in their tasks because we are committed to the \r\nrelease of those being held hostage. The dismantling of \r\nparamilitarism, the weakening of the guerrillas, the \r\nrestoration of effective guarantees for democracy \r\nbeyond rhetoric, and the protection of a free press in a \r\ncountry where 15 journalists were once murdered in a \r\nyear — this year there has been one case — are results \r\nthat allow us to look the world in the eye and demand \r\nfull support for our democratic security policy. \r\n Today there is no paramilitarism. There are \r\nguerrillas and drug traffickers. The term “paramilitary” \r\nwas coined to refer to private criminal organizations \r\nwhose objective was to combat guerrillas. Today, the \r\nsole entity that combats guerrillas is the State, which \r\nhas recovered the monopoly it should never have lost. \r\n With the backing of the United Nations, we are \r\nstriving to assist displaced persons and to restore their \r\ndignity. We have multiplied by a factor of 10 the \r\nbudget to protect them. The phenomenon remains, but \r\nhas shown a significant reduction. \r\n Today, Colombians feel more confident. The \r\ninvestment rate has risen from 12 per cent of gross \r\ndomestic product to 26 per cent. Deficit and \r\nindebtedness are moving towards a net reduction. \r\nUnemployment, which stood at around 20 per cent, is \r\nnow at 11 per cent, and we are struggling to lower it to \r\n7 per cent. We are seeking to reduce poverty, which \r\nstood at close to 40 per cent, to a level no higher than \r\n35 per cent in 2010.  \r\n We are advancing towards the goal of achieving \r\nuniversal access to basic education. We have built an \r\nexcellent technical training system. We have gone from \r\n300,000 to 1.5 million families living in poverty that \r\nreceive a subsidy for their children’s nutrition and \r\neducation. We aim in the next three years to meet the \r\ngoal of universal access to health services. We are \r\nworking hard to fulfil, during the current four-year \r\nperiod, the target of providing 5 million microcredits to \r\nan equal number of families with scarce resources, as a \r\nbasic strategy to overcome factors of exclusion. We \r\nhave gone from 3.7 million to 9 million children who \r\nhave benefited from our food programmes; we expect \r\nto reach 12 million in 2010. Our programme \r\n“Together”, undertaken to eliminate extreme poverty, \r\ncombines a variety of social tools to cover 1.5 million \r\nfamilies. \r\n We reaffirm our commitment to fighting global \r\nwarming. We have gone from 37,000 natural gas \r\nvehicles to nearly 300,000. We have moved forward in \r\nthe construction of mass transportation systems in nine \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 10 \r\n \r\ncities to reduce individual transportation. With \r\nindigenous communities, we have advanced in the \r\nconstruction of a series of villages that compose a \r\nbarrier for the complete recovery of the Sierra Nevada \r\nde Santa Marta. Our new forest law prohibits the \r\ndestruction of the rainforest and changes in land use. \r\nColombia has 578,000 square kilometres of tropical \r\nforest, which constitutes a lung of the planet. We will \r\nsoon have 80,000 forest-keeper families, who are \r\nremunerated by the State and are committed to \r\nabandoning illicit drug production and to supervising \r\nthe recovery of destroyed forests. One national \r\nobjective is the production of bio-fuels, for which we \r\nhave 44 million hectares of savannah, which will allow \r\ngreater development, initially in sugarcane and African \r\npalm, without jeopardizing food security or destroying \r\na single square millimetre of rainforest. \r\n I thank the United Nations system for all its \r\nsupport for Colombia, and I would like to highlight \r\nfour areas. The United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime has been the guarantor and supervisor of our \r\nforest-keeper families programme to protect the \r\nrainforest from the destructive threat of drug \r\ntrafficking. The International Labour Organization \r\ncarries out excellent work in our workers’ protection \r\nprogramme. We have extended the mandate of the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to \r\nmaintain its presence in Colombia for the remainder of \r\nmy Government’s term of office. Furthermore, various \r\nUnited Nations entities provide valuable support in the \r\ntask of assisting displaced people. \r\n We continue working for a society without \r\nexclusion and without class hatred, in permanent \r\nconstructive debate; one that looks for options, that \r\ndoes not stagnate in insurmountable antagonisms, that \r\nis respectful of the Democratic Constitution and guided \r\nby a long-term vision, and that sustains itself on an \r\ninclusive dialogue every day. \r\n I thank the international community for all its \r\nsupport. I invite everyone to visit Colombia, to talk to \r\nour fellow countrymen and women, and to experience \r\nthe collective spirit to fight for the greater happiness of \r\nfuture generations. Colombia should be known not \r\nthrough bad news, but rather through a great \r\nrelationship with Colombians themselves. I reiterate \r\nthe invitation to visit our country. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo. \r\n Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Kabila Kabange (spoke French): \r\nAllow me to join previous speakers from this rostrum \r\nin sincerely congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly.  \r\n I also pay sincere tribute to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his tireless and laudable efforts to \r\ndefend and promote the purposes and principles of the \r\nOrganization’s Charter. His visit to our country shortly \r\nafter he took office reassured us of his commitment \r\nand that of the United Nations to the Congolese people \r\nin its quest for peace, freedom and development. \r\n The sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly is taking place in an international context \r\nmarked by persistent violence throughout the world. \r\nThe United Nations task is harder than ever; by the \r\nsame token, it is more noble and inspiring than ever.  \r\n For the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this \r\nsession is unlike previous sessions. It marks our rebirth \r\nas a State based on law. It also marks our return to \r\ninternational affairs as a credible actor and partner. \r\nToday more than in the past, my country is aware of \r\nthe evils of war and of poor governance, as well as of a \r\npromising future of stable institutions, legitimate \r\nauthorities and peaceful coexistence among peoples. \r\nMy country is thus aware of the irreplaceable value of \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n11 07-51956 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations. We are an example of the \r\nOrganization’s successful work.  \r\n I should like to pay tribute to our bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partners, and in particular to the United \r\nNations, for their invaluable assistance. Having \r\nreceived so much, we believe that it is now our turn to \r\ncontribute to peacekeeping operations. We look \r\nforward to playing an increasingly important role; in \r\nthe meantime, we have made the modest contribution \r\nof civilian police officers now deployed in two \r\nMember States. \r\n The path to the irreversible end of the multitude \r\nof crises that have beset my country for so many years \r\nremains strewn with obstacles. From the security \r\nperspective, we still need to finalize the process of \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration, \r\ncomplete the creation of a national republican police \r\nforce and army, and operationalize a credible justice \r\nsystem. Attaining that three-fold goal is an absolute \r\npriority for us.  \r\n Moreover, while stressing the political and \r\ndiplomatic approach, we must do all we can, resolutely \r\nand with a heightened sense of urgency, to resolve the \r\nremaining problems of insecurity in North Kivu. \r\nNothing can reasonably justify a situation in which \r\nCongolese continue to be the daily targets of every \r\nmanner of violence and abuse from national and \r\nforeign armed groups, and in which masses of our \r\npeople are displaced by war. Peace and security must \r\nrapidly and at all costs be restored to that part of our \r\nterritory, and they will be. \r\n With regard to foreign armed groups, United \r\nNations support is crucial to their voluntary or, if need \r\nbe, forced disarmament, repatriation and reintegration.  \r\n Despite such difficulties, we have in less than \r\nfive years successfully met the challenge of organizing \r\ndemocratic elections, establishing legitimate \r\ninstitutions, and relaunching economic growth. Our \r\ncurrent priority is reconstruction and development with \r\nthe aim of rolling back poverty, injustice and social \r\ninequalities. It is an immense task; if we are to meet it, \r\nthe resolve of our people and its aspirations to a great \r\nfuture will be critical, though not sufficient. The \r\nunflagging and unreserved involvement of all our \r\ndiverse partners remains indispensable.  \r\n Notwithstanding certain deficiencies, the United \r\nNations remains the conscious of humankind. Its \r\npresent and future role must be seen in the context of \r\nthe world’s evolution and ever-changing challenges. \r\nThe future will be a time of increased competition \r\namong nations, particularly in the areas of trade, \r\nfinance and research, as well as of the universal \r\nenjoyment of clean air, drinking water and natural \r\nresources — vital commodities that the ever-growing \r\npopulation and economies of the world are making \r\nincreasingly precious and scarce.  \r\n In the face of those challenges and of the ongoing \r\nthreats to international peace and security, the United \r\nNations credibility will depend on its ability to ensure \r\nthat all Member States without exception implement its \r\ndecisions and that commitments they have freely \r\nentered into are effectively honoured.  \r\n In that respect, turning to the Middle East, the \r\ncredibility of our Organization will always be in \r\nquestion so long as the Security Council fails to do all \r\nin its power to ensure, pursuant to the provisions of our \r\nCharter and the relevant resolutions, the effective \r\nestablishment of two States, living side by side in \r\npeace and security.  \r\n On another subject, climate change is an \r\nundeniable reality today, an eloquent instance of the \r\nconstantly changing face of collective security. Its \r\neffects, unfortunately, will be more harmful in the \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly and unfairly in \r\nAfrica. Africa contributes the least to greenhouse gas \r\nemissions and does not have the resources to deal with \r\ntheir terrible consequences.  \r\n Making this point is a stark reminder of the need \r\nfor a responsible, equitable and unified approach to the \r\nproblems of sustainable development. I therefore \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s organization on \r\n24 September of the high-level meeting on climate \r\nchange. The meeting was an opportunity for us to \r\ndevote to that crucial subject the attention it deserves \r\nand to sensitize ourselves to the consequences of the \r\npatterns of consumption that expose our world to the \r\nthreat of an irreversible disaster.  \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the \r\nnatural habitat of unparalleled biological diversity. Its \r\nprimeval forests make Central Africa the second lung \r\nof the world. We therefore undertake to participate in \r\nthe design and implementation of an effective strategy \r\nto preserve optimum conditions of life on Earth. In the \r\ninterests of humankind, we are prepared to make the \r\nsacrifices required by collective responsibility. In \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 12 \r\n \r\nreturn, we call for fair compensation to ensure that we \r\ndo not jeopardize our own development. \r\n In the face of changes on the world scene, our \r\nOrganization must adjust and espouse an architecture \r\nthat, while preserving universal values, makes it fit to \r\nmeet increasingly diverse and growing challenges. \r\nDemocracy, which today is universally recognized as \r\nthe best form of Government, should not only permeate \r\nour collective action in international affairs, but should \r\nalso be reflected within our Organization. \r\n Accordingly, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo welcomes the process of reforming the United \r\nNations system to create greater coherence and \r\neffectiveness of action. We wish to stress that increased \r\nrepresentation within the Security Council is a \r\ndemocratic requirement necessary to the harmonious \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations. The continent of \r\nAfrica must be represented on a permanent basis within \r\nthat important organ.  \r\n We also draw the Assembly’s attention to the fact \r\nthat Security Council reform must not eclipse the need \r\nto revisit other bodies of this Organization. Their \r\nworking methods should be as efficient as possible and \r\ntheir future interaction better defined. As to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, its authority must be further \r\nreinforced so as to enable its President to play a \r\npre-eminent role in the search for solutions to \r\ninternational problems. \r\n With regard to the new threats and challenges \r\nlooming on the horizon, I have recalled the respective \r\ncommitments made by Member States under the United \r\nNations Charter, and I have reaffirmed the commitment \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo to that \r\nfounding text of our Organization. I have also drawn \r\nthe Assembly’s attention to the various scourges that \r\ncharacterize the international context and to the threats \r\nrelating to climate change. I have thereby stressed the \r\nneed for us to combine our efforts if we wish to enable \r\nour peoples to live in a world that enjoys the best \r\npossible living conditions, social progress and \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n Our political resolve to eradicate those scourges \r\nand our decisive, concerted action to do so will be the \r\nproof of how genuine our commitment really is to \r\nimproving the state of the world. That is the only way \r\nto bolster the confidence of our peoples in our \r\nOrganization. It is the only way, and nothing less will \r\ndo, to safeguard the legitimacy of the United Nations \r\nand to consolidate the effectiveness of its action. Let us \r\nmeet that challenge together. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. José Ramos-Horta, President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Democratic Republic \r\nof Timor-Leste. \r\n Mr. José Ramos-Horta, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. José Ramos-Horta, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ramos-Horta (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): As I address \r\nthis body, may I seize this opportunity to extend to \r\nMr. Kerim my sincere and warm congratulations on his \r\nwell-deserved election to preside over the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n In view of the constraints of time and in \r\ndeference to all, I shall take no more than 10 minutes \r\nto share some facts and reflections on the situation in \r\nmy country, as well as on select issues of regional and \r\ninternational concern. \r\n Timor-Leste is encouraged by Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s organization of the high-level event on \r\nclimate change, to be followed by negotiations on the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention in Bali. The \r\nindustrialized countries of the North bear enormous \r\nresponsibility for the damage done to our fragile \r\necosystems. They, more than anyone else, must reverse \r\nthe course and lead the effort to save the Earth. \r\nHowever, we in the developing world cannot escape \r\nour own responsibilities. The demographic explosion \r\nand our own efforts to catch up with the rich North all \r\ncontribute to the pressures on our lands, forests, rivers, \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n13 07-51956 \r\n \r\nlakes and oceans. Let us therefore set rhetoric aside \r\nand work as one to redress the enormous damage we \r\nhave done to the common home of humankind. \r\n As to the political situation in Timor Leste, in \r\nApril and May 2006, less than five years after my \r\ncountry’s accession to full independence, we were \r\nplunged into our first major crisis. The then President \r\nof the Republic, the Speaker of the National Parliament \r\nand the Prime Minister jointly agreed to seek the \r\nUnited Nations urgent assistance and the rapid \r\nintervention of friendly countries. I wish to reiterate \r\nhere our sincere gratitude to those who came to our \r\nassistance in that time of need. We are forever grateful \r\nto Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, as well as to \r\nPortugal, which dispatched a fully equipped company \r\nof its elite force, the National Republican Guard. The \r\nSecurity Council approved the deployment of an \r\nintegrated mission, the United Nations Integrated \r\nMission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), with a police \r\ncomponent of 1,740 police. The deployment of the \r\nUnited Nations police contingent was understandably \r\nextremely slow, and the projected force was complete \r\nonly in January 2007. \r\n We have made significant progress since the dark \r\nweeks of April and May 2006. Presidential and \r\nlegislative elections were held between April and June \r\n2007. The election campaign period was mostly free of \r\nviolence and there were few reported irregularities. \r\nThough we are proud that the two elections were \r\nmanaged by our own agencies, we also acknowledge \r\nthat the active support of UNMIT and other United \r\nNations agencies, including the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, were indispensable and \r\ncrucial to enable us to undertake such a complex task. \r\n While the result of the presidential election was \r\nwarmly welcomed by all, including the defeated \r\ncandidate, the same did not happen when a new \r\nGovernment was announced following the 30 June \r\nlegislative election. FRETILIN, the former ruling \r\nparty, won most votes, but not enough to govern on its \r\nown; after several weeks of lobbying, it failed to forge \r\na coalition to govern. A post-election four-party \r\nparliamentary alliance opposed to FRETILIN secured \r\n37 seats in the new Parliament of 65 seats, was invited \r\nto form a Government. There was violence in a number \r\nof locations in which local law enforcement elements \r\nwere implicated, but the swift intervention of the \r\nUnited Nations police and the International \r\nStabilization Force (ISF) succeeded in quickly \r\ncontrolling the situation. Our own defence force played \r\na constructive role in helping to defuse the violence. I \r\nalso acknowledge the role played by the FRETILIN \r\nleadership in restraining its more passionate followers. \r\n Law and order have been restored. However, the \r\nrelative tranquillity prevailing in the country is \r\nprecarious and due in large measure to the effective \r\nrole played by United Nations police, ISF and our own \r\ndefence force. That will remain the case until such time \r\nas our police force has been reconstructed and turned \r\ninto a credible and effective force. That will take two \r\nto five years at a minimum. I wish to assure all that, in \r\nthe meantime, the East Timorese will pursue national \r\ndialogue so that we can reconcile and heal the wounds \r\nof the past. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n As to the social situation in Timor Leste, the 2006 \r\ncrisis caused widespread looting and destruction in the \r\ncapital. More than 30 people died, more than 100 were \r\nwounded, and tens of thousands were displaced. We are \r\nslowly recovering. However, tens of thousands of \r\npeople remain in precarious camps in the capital and \r\nelsewhere. I thank the international community, the \r\nUnited Nations and its agencies, the International \r\nOrganization for Migration, and international \r\nnon-governmental organizations for their generous and \r\nprompt assistance. The new Government has pledged \r\nto cooperate with all to address the situation of \r\ninternally displaced persons. \r\n Last year’s late rains, floods and a locust plague \r\nhave caused significant damage to our subsistence \r\nagriculture sector. As a result, an acute food shortage is \r\nforeseen in the coming months. The Government is \r\nplanning to purchase significant amounts of food items \r\nin the regional markets to make up for the food \r\nshortage. \r\n Endowed with some oil and gas resources, Timor-\r\nLeste cannot complain of not having enough financial \r\nmeans to turn our economy around and lift the living \r\nstandards of our people. According to a recent report of \r\nthe Asian Development Bank, Timor-Leste’s economy \r\nwill see a strong 22-per-cent growth this year due to \r\nour oil revenues. \r\n However, all this is not enough to improve the \r\nliving standards of the people. The vast majority of the \r\npeople who have been poor for centuries should not \r\nwait. I have pledged to be the President of the poor and \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 14 \r\n \r\nI intend to be their best advocate. I am establishing a \r\nfast-track mechanism under my personal leadership to \r\nprovide direct assistance to individuals, groups or rural \r\ncommunities. The idea is that it should take no more \r\nthan 10 working days for a decision to be made on a \r\nproject and for the first instalment of a grant to be \r\ndisbursed. Coupled with public investments in \r\ninfrastructure — roads, bridges, port and airport — and \r\nin the agriculture sector, Timor-Leste should see, in the \r\nmedium term, a significant reduction of unemployment \r\nand a decrease in poverty levels. \r\n Regarding the presence of the United Nations, we \r\nare cognizant of the fact that the international \r\ncommunity faces a number of critical situations around \r\nthe world — in the Middle East, Somalia, the Sudan-\r\nDarfur, Iraq and Afghanistan, to mention but a few — \r\nthat are far more serious than the situation in my \r\ncountry and that may be of greater strategic importance \r\nand have greater implications for regional and world \r\npeace. We hope that as the situation progresses, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission will consider placing \r\nTimor-Leste on its agenda as a follow-up to UNMIT. \r\n I now turn to the issues of human rights, the rule \r\nof law and justice. At the time that sovereignty was \r\ntransferred to the people of Timor-Leste, in May 2002, \r\nwhat existed was no more than the sketch — the \r\nidea — of a modern, democratic State. We had to build \r\nour country from scratch. While we failed in many \r\nareas, we succeeded in others. We have succeeded in \r\nnot abandoning our deep commitment to our human \r\nrights and the rule of law. Timor-Leste stands among \r\nthe very few that have ratified all seven core human \r\nrights treaties.  \r\n Timor-Leste seeks a seat on the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the term 2008-2011, and we are \r\nparticularly pleased and grateful that many countries \r\nhave so far expressed support for our candidacy. I wish \r\nto assure everyone that as a member of the Council, \r\nTimor-Leste will favour dialogue on human rights \r\nsituations and will accord priority to strengthening \r\nthematic procedures, promoting the ratification of \r\nexisting human rights treaties and strengthening \r\nnational and regional human rights mechanisms. \r\n Next, I shall discuss the Truth and Friendship \r\nCommission. In August 2005, the Presidents of Timor-\r\nLeste and Indonesia inaugurated a forward-looking \r\npolicy and mechanism of truth-finding as a means to \r\naddress the violence of 1999, when the two countries \r\nparted ways. While there were some calls for the \r\nestablishment of an ad hoc international tribunal to try \r\nthose responsible for the 1999 violence, the leaders of \r\nthe two countries opted instead for a binational version \r\nof the South African truth and reconciliation process. \r\nThat was a novel and unique approach to redressing the \r\nwrongs of the past, although, being untested, it \r\nprovoked much criticism and opposition in certain \r\nquarters. \r\n With regard to international and regional \r\nrelations, we are expanding and consolidating our \r\nrelations with the region and the rest of the world. We \r\nare an active member of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum and are \r\nworking towards full membership in ASEAN. We are \r\nan active observer in the Pacific Islands Forum and a \r\nmember of the Comunidade dos países de Lingua \r\nPortuguesa (CPLD). \r\n I shall now turn to some international issues of \r\nconcern to Timor-Leste. With regard to the situation in \r\nMyanmar, I wish to say that, as a country of the region, \r\nTimor-Leste is following the developments there with \r\ndeep concern and disappointment. As human beings \r\nand friends, we are distressed at the deteriorating \r\nsocial, humanitarian and political conditions in that \r\nneighbouring country. The leaders of Myanmar must \r\nnot continue to hold Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw \r\nAung San Suu Kyi and the entire nation hostage to a \r\nmindset that belongs to the cold war and to policies \r\nthat have brought international opprobrium and \r\neconomic ruin to a country endowed with vast natural \r\nresources and a very proud people. \r\n With regard to nuclear proliferation, Timor-Leste \r\ncommends the six-party talks on North Korea, which \r\nhave achieved some modest positive results in inducing \r\nthat country to reverse its nuclear-weapons capability. \r\nThat modest success shows that patient diplomacy can \r\nmake progress on even the most intractable conflicts \r\nwhen the parties involved identify common concern \r\nand interest. \r\n On the other hand, Timor-Leste is deeply \r\nconcerned about the climate of mistrust and \r\nconfrontation regarding the situation in Iran. Iran is \r\nentitled to explore all peaceful means to acquire \r\ntechnology that would make it less reliant on \r\nnon-renewable sources of energy. No one denies that \r\nIran or any other nation has that right. However, Iran \r\nmust do more to cooperate fully with the International \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n15 07-51956 \r\n \r\nAtomic Energy Agency and to reassure its neighbours \r\nand the rest of the world that it is not seeking to \r\nacquire nuclear-weapons capability. \r\n Asia is the most nuclearized region of the world. \r\nI do not know that we should be proud of such a status. \r\nMutually assured destruction — MAD — is indeed \r\nmadness, as the acronym itself suggests. Our scientists \r\nhave developed Frankenstein’s monsters that may well \r\ndestroy us all — either by design, if the weapons fall \r\ninto the hands of non-State actors, or by accident. \r\n Concerning the death penalty, Timor-Leste is part \r\nof a cross-regional initiative calling for a moratorium. \r\nWe note that the trend towards the worldwide abolition \r\nof the death penalty continues. \r\n As for the situation in Darfur, Timor-Leste \r\ncommends the African Union, the United Nations, all \r\nthose in Government and those individuals who have \r\ndone their very best to end the suffering of the people \r\nin that region — suffering that is now compounded by \r\nnatural calamity. In the midst of such a tragedy, we can \r\nfind some consolation and inspiration as we see \r\nmillions of people around the world crossing the \r\nboundaries of religions and cultures and joining \r\ntogether in solidarity with the victims of Darfur. \r\n I now turn to the situation in Palestine. As a small \r\nand newly independent nation and a friend of Israel, \r\nTimor-Leste cannot remain indifferent to the suffering \r\nof the Palestinian people, who have many times been \r\nvictims — victims of Israel’s obstinate policies of \r\noccupation and discrimination, victims of manipulation \r\nby regional Powers and victims of their own sectarian \r\ndivision and violence. While Timor-Leste does not \r\nsubscribe to the many one-sided anti-Israel resolutions \r\nadopted over the years in various United Nations \r\nbodies, the facts on the ground show a whole people \r\nliving on the edge of desperation as a result of decades \r\nof humiliation, exclusion and violence. Timor-Leste \r\njoins the rest of the international community in calling \r\nfor the implementation of the Road Map, leading to the \r\nformal establishment of a viable Palestinian State. \r\n With regard to Western Sahara, Timor-Leste is \r\nencouraged and commends both Morocco and the \r\nFrente POLISARIO for the recent talks held on Long \r\nIsland under the good offices of the United Nations.  \r\n Concerning indigenous peoples’ rights, more than \r\n500 years ago — long after Chinese navigators and \r\nexplorers had circumnavigated the globe — European \r\nkings, navigators, missionaries, adventurers and \r\nmercenaries began the great European conquest of the \r\nworld. In the process, tens of millions of people were \r\nsubjugated and colonized, fortunes and empires were \r\nmade at the expense of the peoples with whom they \r\ncame into contact and new diseases were brought into \r\nthe new colonies. Slavery uprooted at least 10 million \r\nfrom the African continent. Millions of indigenous \r\npeoples were decimated by wars and diseases. Their \r\ndemise and their lands gave birth to new nations that \r\nwere alien to their sacred birthplaces. This very island \r\nof Manhattan was once the sovereign home of Native \r\nAmericans.  \r\n That is all part of the history of the world: the \r\nhistory of European conquest, with its glory and \r\ntragedy. Timor-Leste commends the General Assembly \r\nfor finally adopting the United Nations Declaration on \r\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295, \r\nannex). That is the least we can do to redress the grave \r\ninjustices done to some of the earlier civilizations of \r\nthe world. \r\n I now turn to the issue of United Nations reform. \r\nNegotiations on reform of the United Nations system, \r\nin particular of the Security Council, should begin. \r\nRather than seeking dramatic reforms, we may want to \r\nadopt an incremental approach. The Council must be \r\nincrementally expanded to include major Powers such \r\nas India, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, South Africa and \r\nGermany. On the other hand, it is an absurdity that \r\nAsia, which contains almost half of the world’s \r\npopulation, should be so grossly underrepresented. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor Leste for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. José Ramos-Horta, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor Leste, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the United Republic \r\nof Tanzania.  \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.  \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 16 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, \r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Kikwete: Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. Kerim for his well deserved \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. He can count on Tanzania’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation as he discharges his mandate. \r\nI also commend his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa, for having skilfully presided over the sixty-\r\nfirst session. \r\n We also congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nunanimous election as the eighth Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, which reflects his distinguished \r\ndiplomatic track record, integrity and commitment to \r\ninternational diplomacy. I thank him for the honour and \r\ntrust he has bestowed upon my country, by appointing \r\nan accomplished Tanzanian academic and diplomat to \r\nthe post of Deputy-Secretary-General. I take this \r\nopportunity to once again congratulate Ms. Asha-Rose \r\nMigiro, for her appointment to that high office. I trust \r\nthat such a combination of diligence and devoted \r\nleadership will steer this important institution towards \r\ngreater heights of success.  \r\n I highly commend the Secretary-General for his \r\ndecision to convene the High-Level Event on Climate \r\nChange four days ago. The meeting gave us an \r\nopportunity to discuss the state of health of our \r\ncommon planet. It also gave us the opportunity to \r\nrenew our commitment to take the necessary steps to \r\ncorrect the mistakes we have made. It is indisputable \r\nand is attributable, by and large, to human activities. \r\n Unfortunately Africa and many small island \r\nStates contribute the least to the greenhouse gases that \r\ncause this phenomenon and yet suffer the most from \r\nthe impact of climate change. Climate change can also \r\nadversely affect our abilities to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It also threatens to undo \r\nthe results of many decades of development efforts.  \r\n I wish to emphasize that international collective \r\naction is critical in developing an effective response to \r\nglobal warming. Indeed, a review process to consider \r\nfurther commitment on the part of the Parties under the \r\nKyoto Protocol beyond 2012 is urgent and necessary. \r\nTanzania promises to participate actively in the Bali \r\nConference.  \r\n Tanzania welcomes the recent milestones in the \r\nUnited Nations reform process, namely the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund. We attach great importance to these \r\nnew initiatives, and we want to contribute to their \r\nsuccess.  \r\n In its report of November 2006 entitled, \r\n“Delivering as One”, the High-level Panel on United \r\nNations System-wide Coherence made valuable \r\nrecommendations, including the establishment of a \r\n“One United Nations” system at the country level. We \r\nin Tanzania believe that the development coordination \r\nagenda is best served when we have one programme, \r\none budgetary framework, one leader and one office at \r\nthe country level. Tanzania is pleased to be among the \r\neight “One United Nations” pilot countries. The One \r\nUnited Nations Initiative is a logical development from \r\nthe United Nations Development Assistance \r\nFramework (UNDAF), a framework that is fully \r\naligned with our national priorities. The efficiencies in \r\naid delivery expected through “One United Nations” \r\nwill certainly contribute to enhancing our capacity to \r\nattain the MDGs. \r\n I call upon Member States to give our \r\nOrganization, the United Nations, the resources it \r\nneeds to implement this pilot project. The project \r\nshould not fail for lack of resources. I also urge the \r\nBretton Woods institutions to take a keener interest in \r\nthis initiative and join in the efforts to realize its \r\nobjectives. \r\n The need to make the Security Council more \r\nrepresentative is an age-old demand we all share. We \r\nneed to move from rhetoric to action. Now is the time. \r\nTanzania assures the entire United Nations membership \r\nof our wholehearted support and cooperation in this \r\nprocess. \r\n We are now almost halfway through the timeline \r\nof 2015 set for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Yet, we are not halfway in realizing the targets \r\nas spelt out at the Millennium Summit of 2000. We are \r\nin this unfortunate state of affairs because the \r\nadditional resources expected and promised by the \r\ndeveloped countries have not been delivered. I urge \r\nthis Assembly to renew its appeal to the developed \r\nnations to deliver on their promise. \r\n In this regard, we welcome the initiative \r\nmentored by the Norwegian Prime Minister, Mr. Jens \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n17 07-51956 \r\n \r\nStoltenberg, to launch a global campaign to mobilize \r\nresources for achieving Goal No. 4 on reducing infant \r\nmortality rates and Goal No. 5 on reducing maternal \r\nmortality rates. Tanzania supports the effort and we are \r\nhappy to be associated with it. I appeal to all Members \r\nto support the initiative. It is our hope that developed \r\nnations will support the campaign by providing the \r\nrequisite resources.  \r\n In the same vein, we commend Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for establishing the MDG Africa Steering \r\nGroup. Africa is excited about it, and we trust that it \r\nwill give new impetus in assisting Africa attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.  \r\n We also welcome the historic decision taken by \r\nthe President of the General Assembly to convene a \r\nspecial summit of leaders to discuss the MDGs during \r\nthis session. We support this wise decision of our \r\nPresident, for we believe it will provide the needed \r\nmomentum for the timely achievement of the MDGs in \r\nAfrica. Tanzania promises to participate actively in this \r\nimportant meeting.  \r\n We are happy with the tremendous progress made \r\nin Burundi. Peace has been restored, and life has come \r\nback to normal. Tanzania will continue to work with \r\nthe region and South Africa to ensure the full \r\noperationalization of the peace agreement signed \r\nbetween the Burundi Government and the Parti \r\nLibération du Peuple Hutu — Forces nationales de \r\nliberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL) rebel group.  \r\n We are concerned with the fluidity of the \r\nsituation in North Kivu. We hope wisdom will prevail \r\non the parties concerned to give peace a chance. The \r\npeople of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\ndeserve peace; they have missed it for too long. We in \r\nTanzania promise to play whatever part may be \r\nrequired of us. \r\n With peace restored in Burundi and many parts of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is incumbent \r\nupon us in the international community to encourage \r\nand assist refugees to go back to their respective \r\ncountries. That is what the tripartite commissions, \r\ninvolving Tanzania, the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the \r\nrespective countries of Burundi and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, have been doing. Our joint \r\ncommissions have been encouraging the repatriation of \r\nrefugees on a voluntary basis, and we have been \r\nassisting those who have come forward. The results are \r\nencouraging, but things could be better. A word of \r\nencouragement from the Organization could make a \r\ndifference. \r\n Tanzania believes that the return of refugees to \r\ntheir countries of origin, after peace has been restored, \r\nis a sovereign right that should not be denied. It is also \r\nthe ultimate testimony to and guarantor of peace that \r\nhas been attained. It is not fair — it is not right — for \r\npeople to continue to live in refugee camps after peace \r\nhas been restored in their countries of origin. \r\n The progress currently being made with regard to \r\nDarfur gives us hope. The adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1769 (2007), on the deployment of a hybrid \r\nforce from the African Union and the United Nations, \r\nand the renewed political dialogue among the parties to \r\nthe conflict hold promise for the stalled peace process \r\nand for the humanitarian crisis that unfortunately \r\npersists there. Tanzania applauds the unique \r\npartnership which has evolved between the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations. We stand ready to \r\ncontribute troops to the hybrid force. \r\n We are encouraged by the recent developments \r\nwith regard to internal political dialogue in Somalia. \r\nWe are equally happy with the attention given to \r\nSomalia by the Security Council and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We welcome the recent Security Council \r\nresolution 1772 (2007), which supports the political \r\nprocess in Somalia and the role of the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM). We commend \r\nUganda’s contribution of peacekeepers to Somalia and \r\nthe good work they have been doing so far. As a \r\nmember of the International Contact Group on \r\nSomalia, Tanzania promises to continue to be proactive \r\nand offers to contribute in the training of the Somali \r\nmilitary. \r\n The United Nations should remain seized of the \r\nissue of Western Sahara. Tanzania reaffirms its support \r\nfor the inalienable right of the Saharawi people to \r\ndecide and choose the way forward. We urge the \r\nUnited Nations to intensify its efforts to find an \r\nhonourable and just solution to this long-standing \r\ndecolonization issue. \r\n The crisis inside the Palestinian territories is \r\nunfortunate; it is a matter of great concern to many of \r\nus. Tanzania remains supportive of efforts aimed at \r\ncreating two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by \r\nside and at peace with each other. This presents, in our \r\nview, the best hope for sustainable peace in the region. \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 18 \r\n \r\nWe applaud and welcome the renewed international \r\ninterest and efforts being expended in line with the \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. \r\n In conclusion, Tanzania reaffirms its belief in and \r\ncommitment to multilateralism and the United Nations. \r\nThe Assembly can count on Tanzania’s continued \r\nsupport to this Organization and the ideals for which it \r\nstands. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Fernández Reyna (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of the \r\nDominican Republic, it is a pleasure to extend our \r\nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia upon his \r\nrecent election as President of the General Assembly. \r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to greet the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly. \r\n During the four years following the Millennium \r\nSummit of 2000, the Dominican Republic went through \r\na crisis, during which our national currency was \r\ndevalued by 100 per cent. Our working class had to \r\ndouble its efforts simply to meet their basic subsistence \r\nneeds. Drug trafficking and high levels of crime gained \r\na foothold, and our credibility went down worldwide. \r\nAccording to the statistics of the World Bank, the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the \r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, more than 1.5 million out of the 9 million \r\nDominicans sank into the lowest levels of poverty. At \r\nthat time, we were facing one of the most dramatic \r\ncrises in the modern history of the Dominican \r\nRepublic. \r\n Since we took the reins of administration in 2004, \r\nthe Dominican Republic has managed to recover the \r\nconfidence of investors and entrepreneurs. We have \r\nbeen able to reactivate economic growth. We have been \r\nable to reduce inflation. We have increased jobs and \r\nimproved social conditions and quality of life for the \r\nDominican people. \r\n However, exactly when we began, just like the \r\nphoenix rising from its own ashes, a gloomy \r\ninternational picture threatened to darken our prospects \r\nfor future growth. In recent weeks, for example, the \r\nprice of oil on the international market has reached an \r\nunprecedented rate, and projections point towards \r\ncontinued increases. These price increases are \r\nasphyxiating our economies. \r\n Similarly, in recent times, as a result of changes \r\non the international stage, free zone companies in the \r\nDominican Republic, alongside those in Mexico and \r\nCentral America, have been losing their competitive \r\nedge to Asian countries. This drop in competitiveness \r\nhas resulted in the loss of jobs, production stagnation \r\nand a shortage of new investment. \r\n Moreover, while the price of oil is rising, and \r\nwith the prices of goods in the global economy \r\nfluctuating, we also find ourselves unexpectedly \r\naffected by price increases for food. All of a sudden we \r\nare surprised by the news that owing to the elimination \r\nof export subsidies in Europe, the price of milk has \r\nincreased on the international market. The same has \r\noccurred, although for different reasons, with the cost \r\nof corn, soybeans and wheat as well as with other \r\nproducts that comprise the basic nutrition of the family. \r\nBecause of the climbing prices of those products, the \r\ncost of chicken, turkey, bread and eggs have also risen. \r\n As will be appreciated, we are facing a dangerous \r\nsituation which could lead our people towards \r\nwidespread famine and, consequently, a plunge into \r\nextreme poverty. Those factors have led to a vicious \r\ncycle that is spreading throughout the global food \r\nchain, while, in spite of the plea for free trade, \r\nproducers in the world’s most powerful countries \r\nremain protected. As an example, while a United States \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n19 07-51956 \r\n \r\nfarmer has access to state-of-the-art farming \r\nequipment, the most modern facilities and \r\ntechnologically proficient staff, that farmer also \r\nreceives government subsidies of approximately \r\nUS $750,000 per year. Furthermore, the farmer might \r\nproduce a pound of corn for a mere 7 cents. \r\n At the same time, Félix David García Peña, also a \r\ncorn farmer, who belongs to the Association of Farmers \r\nin San Juan de la Maguana in the southern part of the \r\nDominican Republic near our border with Haiti, is \r\nstruggling alone to make ends meet and to lead a \r\ndecent life. His farming equipment is outdated. His \r\ntractor emits clouds of smoke every morning when he \r\nattempts to turn it on. His facilities are dilapidated. He \r\nreceives no government subsidies since the \r\nGovernment is in no financial position to help him, and \r\nhis production cost for one pound of corn is 12 cents, \r\nalmost double the production cost of the subsidized \r\nUnited States farmer. When we asked Félix how we, as \r\nthe Government, could help him, he stated, “I don’t \r\nwant anything. All I want is fair trade to be able to sell \r\nmy corn.” \r\n The fact is that the challenges of globalization are \r\nhaving a marked impact on countries like the \r\nDominican Republic. What we are experiencing is the \r\ninterdependent character of current international \r\ntrends. What seems to be a distant or remote event \r\nnevertheless has a direct impact on the daily lives of \r\nour peoples. \r\n Another example that illustrates the undeniable \r\ninterdependence of all nations on earth is climate \r\nchange. That topic is not new to our discussions in this \r\nOrganization, but with each year that passes we find \r\nourselves closer to the predicted disasters. \r\n In the Dominican Republic, we are already \r\nexperiencing the impact of climate change in various \r\nways: an increase in the volatility and frequency of \r\nfloods, droughts and hurricanes that destroy our \r\necosystem, our biodiversity and our infrastructures. \r\nAlso, we are experiencing increased coastal erosion \r\nand loss of beaches as well as frequent bleaching of \r\nour coral reefs, thus reducing our marine biodiversity \r\nand making tourism less attractive. \r\n Given all those challenges presented by \r\nglobalization, a country like the Dominican Republic \r\nasks itself: where is international solidarity, where is \r\ncooperation between peoples, how are we going to \r\naddress together all of those challenges which affect \r\nmost of the peoples of the world? \r\n The truth is that there cannot be solidarity when \r\nthere are those in the world who seek to accumulate \r\nwealth even while others suffer. There cannot be \r\ncooperation when there are people who think only of \r\nconducting business without taking into account the \r\npain and anguish of others. \r\n The United Nations system was created to \r\npromote solidarity and cooperation, and it is only fair \r\nto recognize that there is no other organization at the \r\nworld level that has the prestige, capability and \r\nvocation of the Members of this world Organization. \r\nHowever, this grand forum of humanity, established \r\nafter the enormous sacrifices of the Second World War, \r\nmust also reform itself, if it intends to fulfil the ideals \r\nthat inspired its creation, as enshrined in the Charter at \r\nthe San Francisco Conference. \r\n The current structure of the United Nations is no \r\nlonger adequate today. The structure still corresponds \r\nto the cold-war period, even though humankind has \r\nadvanced beyond an era when all events of importance \r\nwere determined by the rivalry of two super-Powers. \r\n Now, in the twenty-first century, we in the \r\nDominican Republic do not truly comprehend why the \r\nPresident of the World Bank must be an American and \r\nthe Managing Director of the International Monetary \r\nFund, a European and why major global decisions are \r\nthe responsibility of only five countries. \r\n As one of the founding Members of the United \r\nNations, the Dominican Republic aspires to a position \r\non the United Nations Security Council as a \r\nnon-permanent member. In that position, we would \r\nstrive to be a voice in favour of the weak, those \r\nwithout protection or shelter, the forsaken of the world. \r\nThat is our sole aspiration. The Dominican Republic \r\nwill uphold, responsibly and with conviction and \r\ndetermination, the values and principles the \r\nOrganization has pledged to represent, as a beacon for \r\npeace, human dignity and the civilized coexistence of \r\nall inhabitants of the Earth. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDominican Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 20 \r\n \r\n Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n  Mr. Ramgoolam (Mauritius), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea. \r\n Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema \r\nMbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in \r\nSpanish): On behalf of the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea, I should like to join previous speakers in \r\nexpressing our support and congratulations to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the Republic of \r\nMacedonia on his election to preside over the debates \r\nof the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. \r\nWe congratulate him because his country is an example \r\nof freedom and democracy and because, for the United \r\nNations, the sovereign equality of States — whether \r\nlarge or small — is a principle of respect for dignity, \r\njustice, equality and peace throughout the world. We \r\nare convinced that under his far-sighted leadership the \r\nAssembly will ensure that those principles are \r\nobserved and respected by all. \r\n We also congratulate his predecessor, Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession, on her great political skill in serving the \r\ninterests of the international community at a time \r\ndominated by wars, conflicts of interest and natural \r\ndisasters. \r\n In addition, we commend the laudable work of \r\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-\r\nmoon, who deserves our full support so that United \r\nNations intervention can be effective in conflicts and \r\nsituations threatening peace, stability and the well-\r\nbeing of nations. \r\n Equatorial Guinea is participating in the present \r\nsession of the General Assembly with uncertainty \r\nregarding United Nations efforts, which are drowning \r\nin a vicious circle of good declarations of principle and \r\ntechnical and scientific definitions, which are ethically \r\nmotivated but which ultimately fail to attain the \r\nobjectives of the peace, security, development and \r\nwell-being of humanity, which inspired the \r\nestablishment of this world Organization. \r\n Indeed, the fact that, despite so many preventive \r\nresolutions, we are focusing this year’s deliberations \r\non atmospheric degradation, which currently poses a \r\nthreat to humanity because of nuclear tests; the \r\nproliferation of chemical industries with military \r\npurposes, which are destroying vital elements of the \r\nenvironment; the use of chemical weapons and other \r\nweapons of mass destruction in armed conflicts; and \r\nthe irrational use of non-renewable natural resources, \r\nwhich is destroying ecosystems — activities that do \r\nnot seek the common good of humanity, but that have \r\ncaused the destruction of the ozone layer and the \r\nbreakdown of the components of the planet’s \r\natmospheric equilibrium. This is an obvious sign that \r\nour resolutions are being ignored. The tsunami, if it \r\nwas not the result of a nuclear test, must be the \r\nconsequence of this atmospheric deterioration, which \r\nhas now increased the number of floods, hurricanes, \r\nfires, cyclones, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n Nevertheless, for more than 20 years the United \r\nNations has undertaken praiseworthy initiatives to \r\nreduce spending on these activities and to use the \r\nsurplus on development in the poorest countries. \r\nDespite that, no favourable response has been made by \r\nthe countries owning these industries. Nor has the \r\nKyoto Protocol itself — which obliges States to reduce \r\ntheir emissions of harmful gases — been ratified by all \r\nthe States Members of the Organization. \r\n Equatorial Guinea believes that the phenomenon \r\nof climate change must be addressed by the United \r\nNations with the same intensity with which it is \r\ncurrently addressing issues that include, among others, \r\ndemocracy, human rights and the threat of terrorism.  \r\n It is correct to say that climate change is a \r\nchallenge for all States, because its effects are truly \r\nharmful to everyone. But we cannot ignore the fact that \r\nthe primary responsibility lies with those who \r\ndeveloped, for their own interests, the technologies that \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n21 07-51956 \r\n \r\nare destroying the ozone layer. The countries of the \r\ntropical forests of the Congo Basin in Africa and the \r\nAmazon Basin in South Africa cannot make use of \r\ntheir own forest resources, because they must \r\ncontribute to the maintenance of the ecosystems that \r\nhelp to maintain the ozone layer. However, there are no \r\ncompensatory policies to avert the economic resource \r\ncrisis occurring among the affected peoples.  \r\n My Government is now committed, in the spirit \r\nof the Kyoto Protocol, to processing the gas produced \r\nby the oilfields of my country and its neighbours into \r\nliquefied gas for the benefit of humanity. Nevertheless, \r\nEquatorial Guinea cannot manage to benefit from the \r\ncredits offered by the international financial \r\ninstitutions and bodies, because we qualify as a \r\nmiddle-income country, whereas it is known that we \r\nhave produced oil for only 10 years and have never had \r\nany development infrastructure.  \r\n Our uncertainty is even greater when we consider \r\nthe problem of development financing for the least \r\ndeveloped countries. In our view, no bilateral or \r\nmultilateral cooperation policy has shown itself to be \r\ncapable of meeting the basic development financing \r\nneeds of poor countries. Because of a lack of political \r\nwill, everything is reduced to political conditioning \r\nfactors and requirements that cannot be met by \r\ncountries seeking to develop. In that regard, Equatorial \r\nGuinea has not been informed of the fate of the 0.7 per \r\ncent — an insignificant amount — that developed \r\ncountries were to give from their gross domestic \r\nproduct for the financing of the least developed \r\ncountries.  \r\n Nor has the question of the cancellation of the \r\nexternal debt of least developed countries and their \r\ninterest been welcomed by creditors, despite their \r\nhistoric obligations. Our experience over many years \r\nhas shown us that Equatorial Guinea cannot develop if \r\nit does not have its own means and if it does not take \r\nprincipal responsibility for it.  \r\n Thus, once oil resources were discovered, the \r\nGovernment organized, in 1997, the first national \r\neconomic conference in order to plan better use of \r\nthese resources for the short, medium and long term. \r\nThe programme adopted has been implemented in a \r\nmanner satisfactory to the people and Government. \r\nNow we can organize the second such national \r\neconomic conference, in order to plan the development \r\nof the country for a sustainable economy. From this \r\nrostrum, we would like to invite bodies of the United \r\nNations system and friendly Governments and \r\ninternational economic institutions to participate in this \r\nconference in Equatorial Guinea in the first two weeks \r\nof November this year, in order to help us by sharing \r\ntheir experiences.  \r\n Humanity has never been threatened and \r\nfrightened as much by terrorism as over this last \r\ndecade. Terrorism used to be known as a process for \r\nthe settlement of accounts through violent means by \r\nthose who felt powerless to see their claims met \r\nthrough legal and democratic processes. It has now \r\nreached different dimensions, which do not uphold \r\nlegitimate claims, nor are their effects directed only \r\nagainst persons or institutions from which rights are \r\nbeing demanded. Any third-party country can be a \r\nvictim of terrorism today, as if it were a country \r\nagainst which the demand may be lodged.  \r\n The result is that today terrorism is a threat \r\nagainst humanity. It violates individual and collective \r\nfreedoms, impedes the exercise of democracy, violates \r\nthe peace and security of nations and stands in the way \r\nof the development of peoples. All countries of the \r\nworld that love peace, justice and freedom have the \r\nduty and the obligation to combat this phenomenon, \r\nwhich is a form of regression of the human species. \r\n However, there seems to be a tendency to ignore \r\nanother, similar phenomenon, namely, the use of \r\nmercenaries, that practice of resorting to force to \r\ndestabilize legitimate political regimes for whatever \r\nreason. In the case of Republic of Equatorial Guinea, it \r\nhas been clearly shown that the invasion operation \r\nagainst our country by mercenary groups in 2004 was \r\norganized to gain access to oil. The masterminds \r\nbehind that operation, clearly identified, were leaders \r\nof Governments of States Members of the United \r\nNations. Since these facts came to light and were \r\ndenounced by my Government, we have not had any \r\ncondemning reaction from specific Member States or \r\nfriendly countries in criticism of the barriers to \r\nbringing to justice the perpetrators of that operation, \r\nwhich means that they would probably be happier had \r\nthe invasion of my country been successful, with the \r\ninherent dramatic consequences. \r\n If we want to combat terrorism and the use of \r\nmercenaries, we need to rely on well-developed \r\ninternal security systems and to exchange information \r\namong States. We have to be faithful and show \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 22 \r\n \r\nsolidarity with the principles of the equal sovereignty \r\nof States, non-interference in internal politics of other \r\nStates and the resolution of controversies by peaceful \r\nmeans, giving priority to dialogue, consultation and \r\ntolerance. We should adamantly condemn any terrorist \r\nact of intimidation and destabilization of States and \r\ntake actions of solidarity against such acts, because \r\nthey threaten State sovereignty and the free will of \r\npeople. \r\n Finally, if we are looking at reform of the United \r\nNations today, it is because the objectives that support \r\nthis world Organization, their very principles, have \r\nbeen and are being systematically violated. The United \r\nNations has gone through many changes: from an \r\norganization aspiring to a universal consensus to one \r\ncomprised of interest blocs; from an organization with \r\nuniversal goals for the well-being of humanity to an \r\norganization of the stronger against the weaker. Today, \r\nthe reason for a veto in the Security Council is not so \r\nmuch the necessity of preventing abuses of power by \r\nsome against humanity as it is an eagerness to defend \r\nthe partisan interests of groups or individuals. Thus, \r\nalthough a veto in the Security Council does not mean \r\nanything today because resolutions are not much \r\nobserved, Africa also has its own interests to defend. \r\nThus we want the right of a veto to be conferred on the \r\ncontinent and not a State, because that continent \r\nrepresents a third of humanity. \r\n The future of humanity is in our hands. Each one \r\nof us must feel committed to meeting the challenges of \r\nour time so that new challenges can become new hopes \r\nfor people. May God guide us in our deliberations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Equatorial Guinea for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Óscar Berger Perdomo, President of \r\nthe Republic of Guatemala \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Óscar Berger Perdomo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Berger Perdomo (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIt has been barely two weeks since I initiated in \r\nGuatemala an electoral process that will conclude on \r\n14 January, when I will have the honour to bestow the \r\npresidential sash on the person elected democratically \r\nby my people. That event will have two consequences: \r\nfirst, representative democracy will be strengthened \r\nfurther in Guatemala, based on an electoral process that \r\neven international observers have described as very \r\nsatisfactory. \r\n Secondly, this is my last appearance before the \r\nGeneral Assembly, an occasion which I take advantage \r\nof in order to attest my support to the United Nations \r\nand to greet our new Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-\r\nmoon, and the outgoing President of the General \r\nAssembly, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, and the \r\nincoming President, Mr. Srgjan Kerim. \r\n Now that we have only a few months before \r\nhanding over power in Guatemala, I wanted to give a \r\nbrief account of the main accomplishments of my \r\nadministration, within the framework of what we \r\nconsider a successful history, despite the problems that \r\ncontinue to besiege us. After overcoming an internal \r\nconflict that lasted four long decades, this story reflects \r\nsuccess not only for Guatemala but also for the United \r\nNations, the Organization that is so closely tied to our \r\nPeace Accords. It is precisely those agreements that \r\nencompass our main objectives, namely strengthening \r\nthe State’s democratic institutions, promoting \r\neconomic and social development, fighting against \r\npoverty and social exclusion, fully respecting human \r\nrights and building a multicultural, multiethnic and \r\nmultilingual Nation. \r\n Allow me to reveal some of the accomplishments \r\nof the past years. First, one of the successes of our \r\nadministration was improving the quality of public \r\nmanagement through the creation or strengthening of \r\npublic institutions, the articulation of coherent policy \r\nprogrammes combined with specific actions and in \r\nmany instances, updated legislation. It would be \r\ntedious to enumerate the multiple areas revamped, \r\nincluding diverse subjects such as food security, the \r\nenergy sector, administrative and financial \r\ndecentralization, governmental administration, the \r\nrevenue administration, trafficking of persons and \r\nassistance to immigrants — the last subject is so dear \r\nto our concerns. \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n23 07-51956 \r\n \r\n At the same time, we have progressed in \r\nstrengthening and creating new democratic \r\nmechanisms control institutions, invigorating the \r\ndirection of ministries as well as enhancing result-\r\noriented management, while all along integrating the \r\nmain political aims with planning and budgets. In that \r\ncontext, we have built a State where public expenditure \r\nand biddings are subject to civil society scrutiny. \r\nHaving instituted the “Guatecompras” programme and \r\nmaking it mandatory for the public sector, we have \r\nreinforced the commitment to work with transparency \r\nin all areas of government. \r\n Secondly, in the last four years we have also \r\nachieved an economic recovery within a framework of \r\na solid financial stability. We exceeded growth rates of \r\n3.5 per cent in the biennium 2004-2005 by attaining \r\n5 per cent in 2006 and 5.6 per cent in 2007. The overall \r\npoverty index fell five percentage points between the \r\nyears 2000 and 2006, from 56 per cent of the \r\npopulation to 51 per cent, respectively. We \r\nacknowledge that ratio is still unacceptably high but \r\nthe achievement of that reduction must inspire us to \r\ncontinue fighting to fulfil in Guatemala one of the main \r\nMillennium Development Goals of the United Nations. \r\nFor that reason, public policy was redirected \r\ncompletely towards rural development, where the main \r\nsocial underdevelopment and poverty are concentrated. \r\n One of the sources of the increasing dynamism of \r\nour economy has been the export sector, whether to \r\nCentral America or to the rest of the world. All that \r\neffort has been impelled by our National Agenda for \r\nCompetitiveness 2005-2015, and it has been \r\ncomplemented by a marked increase in investment in \r\ninfrastructure, mainly in the rural areas. The \r\ncommitment to reach better levels of competitiveness \r\nwas also translated into the construction of a new \r\ninternational airport and the remodelling of six more, \r\nalong with qualitative and quantitative improvements \r\nto seaports, as well as the rehabilitation, paving and \r\nextension of over 2,100 kilometres of roads throughout \r\nthe country. \r\n Thirdly, we have given an enormous impulse to \r\nsocial expenditure, particularly those destined for \r\neducation, health and housing. The goals set forth in \r\nthe Peace Accords of assigning 4.8 per cent of gross \r\ndomestic product to social expenditures have been \r\nsurpassed to reach 5.7 per cent in 2006, approximately \r\ntwice the proportion of ten years ago. \r\n Thanks to that redirection of policy and the \r\nstrengthening of institutional reforms, particularly in \r\neducation, the principal social indicators have begun to \r\nshow significant improvements. For example, the net \r\nrate of school attendance at the primary level was \r\nraised from 72.6 per cent in 1997 to 95.5 per cent in \r\n2006. At the same time, we achieved a higher rate of \r\nhealth coverage, thanks to the strategy adopted, under \r\nwhich another 4.1 million Guatemalans can access that \r\nessential service. \r\n Fourthly, in the area of the inclusion of \r\nindigenous peoples, Guatemala enacted the Public \r\nPolicy for Coexistence and the Elimination of Racism, \r\nunder the aegis of the Presidential Commission Against \r\nDiscrimination. Also, we have incorporated \r\nmulticultural criteria into public policies, planning and \r\nprojects; we have strengthened bilingual and \r\nintercultural education and we have instituted an \r\naffirmative action policy in order to increase the \r\nproportion of indigenous civil employees in the public \r\nsector. \r\n Fifthly, during my administration a human rights \r\napproach was promoted in all public sector policies \r\nand during the past four years more public policies \r\nregarding human rights were enacted than during all \r\nthe previous governments. In that context, allow me to \r\nmention just one aspect: the right of reparations \r\nviolations has been acknowledged for victims of \r\nhuman rights and for that purpose we devised a \r\nNational Plan of Compensation with a duration of \r\n13 years in order to respond to all claims. \r\n Finally, we addressed the issue of citizen security \r\nin an integral manner, a social phenomena conditioned \r\nby multiple economic, social, political and cultural \r\nfactors, while at the same time insisting on the full \r\nobservance of human rights. We recognize that there is \r\nstill much to do in that area, but in practice definite and \r\nsignificant advances have been attained. To address \r\nnew national and regional challenges that have arisen \r\nin regard to citizen insecurity and organized crime, my \r\nadministration concentrated its efforts on strengthening \r\npublic institutions and building democratic \r\ngovernance. \r\n I must state that many of these policies should be \r\nconceived as State policies rather than those of a \r\nparticular Government. In this regard, we have put into \r\nplace a transition programme so as to transfer to the \r\nnew democratically elected authorities, after the second \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 24 \r\n \r\nround of elections to be held on 4 November, all the \r\ninformation deemed most relevant to facilitate the \r\nadministration of the new Government. \r\n Logically, our foreign policy was also inspired by \r\nthe same principles and values as our domestic policy, \r\nwhich I have already outlined. Perhaps the area in \r\nwhich we have best managed to promote these \r\nobjectives is here in the United Nations, which has \r\nworked with us in the negotiation, implementation and \r\nfollow-up to our peace accords. We have tried to repay \r\nthat support in a modest way with our contribution to \r\npeacekeeping operations in various parts of the world, \r\nparticularly in our sister nation of Haiti, as well as \r\nthrough our active presence in various United Nations \r\nforums.  \r\n Given the circumstances, it is in our interest to \r\npreserve, to strengthen and to adapt to modern times \r\nour Organization, the United Nations, whose ideals we \r\nvalue so much. The United Nations occupies a special \r\nplace in our foreign policy. We value it not only for its \r\npast role — the United Nations Verification Mission in \r\nGuatemala left the country at the end of 2004 — but \r\nalso for its continued contributions. In 2006, an office \r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which \r\nworks with and advises and counsels the State, was \r\nestablished. This month, September, a new concerted \r\neffort is being made between Guatemala and the United \r\nNations with the collaboration of a group of friendly \r\nnations, through the creation of an International \r\nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), \r\nwhose objective is to improve our investigation \r\ncapacities and the arraignment and prosecution of \r\ncriminal activities in our country. This is an \r\nunprecedented collaboration between a Member State \r\nand the United Nations, with a view to combating \r\nimpunity, and particularly transnational crime, an \r\nendeavour that will surely yield very tangible benefits \r\nfor my country and valuable experience for the United \r\nNations. \r\n We also reiterate our commitment to the Central \r\nAmerican integration process, which has produced \r\nremarkable advances in the last four years. We are very \r\nclose to securing our integration process by means of \r\nputting in place a customs union, and we are also \r\nembarking on a negotiation process with the European \r\nUnion aimed at securing an association agreement. \r\n Reviewing some of the other items on our \r\nagenda, on Monday of this week I had the privilege to \r\ntake part in the high-level event on climate change, \r\nwhere I added our voice of alarm at the irreversible \r\nharm that we are causing ourselves owing to global \r\ngreenhouse emissions. The amount of scientific data \r\nproving this phenomenon is unquestionable, and \r\nGuatemala has not been spared its effects. But we also \r\nhave the scientific means to mitigate, and even reverse, \r\nrecent tendencies, which requires a shared but \r\ndifferentiated effort on the part of all of us. The United \r\nNations offers unparalleled forums in which to tackle \r\nthis common threat. It is as serious a threat to humanity \r\nas are wars with weapons of mass destruction, or \r\ntransnational terrorism. \r\n I would like in the last part of my speech to talk \r\nabout some of the items on the General Assembly’s \r\nagenda. I have the following specific comments. As a \r\nmulticultural, multiethnic and multilingual country, we \r\nare proud to have worked hand in hand with other \r\ncountries in the negotiations that led to the recent \r\nadoption of the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples. \r\n As a member of the Human Rights Council, we \r\nhave actively participated in its process of institution-\r\nbuilding. We believe that the greatest challenge that the \r\nCouncil has to confront is to finalize that building \r\nprocess and to set in motion the universal, periodic \r\nreview mechanism. Guatemala will be one of the first \r\ncountries to be reviewed. \r\n We are pleased at the holding of the first annual \r\nministerial examination of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, aimed at appraising the progress achieved in \r\nfulfilling the targets and the objectives of development, \r\nas well as the launching of the Development \r\nCooperation Forum. We support any reform and \r\nreorientation of the Organization that will enhance its \r\nability to deliver results, coherence and efficiency. We \r\ntake note of what has already been done in the \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, as well as the \r\nSecretary-General’s ideas for reforming the \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs. We are concerned, \r\nhowever, that the issues of reform relating to the \r\ndevelopment agenda agreed at the World Summit of \r\n2005 are not being accorded the same priority. \r\n Also, as a country that was a principal actor in \r\nthe Financing for Development conference of 2002, we \r\nbelieve that the dialogue scheduled for 23 and \r\n24 October will afford an opportunity to review the \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n25 07-51956 \r\n \r\ncurrent achievements of its goals and to implement the \r\nundertakings set forth in the Monterrey Consensus. \r\n In our capacity as a middle-income country, we \r\nwere pleased at the holding of the Intergovernmental \r\nConference of Middle-Income Countries last March in \r\nSpain, and we are committed to the success of the \r\nsecond such meeting to be convened in El Salvador in \r\nOctober. \r\n We continue to await the much-discussed reform \r\nof the Security Council, and we note the advances \r\nattained during the last session of the Assembly, when \r\nwe were closer than ever before to a process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiation. We trust that during this \r\nsession those efforts will be pursued. \r\n As I have said, this is the last occasion on which I \r\nshall come before the Assembly as President of \r\nGuatemala. I therefore reiterate my deep gratitude to \r\nthe United Nations and to all its Member States for \r\ntheir support for our work and our initiatives during the \r\nfour years of my mandate. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guatemala for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Óscar Berger Perdomo, President of \r\nGuatemala, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic \r\nof Cameroon \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon. \r\n Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cameroon, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Biya (spoke in French): Let me first of \r\nall say that I am happy to see the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, represented by Ambassador \r\nKerim, presiding over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. \r\n My country extends to him wishes for the greatest \r\nsuccess in accomplishing his mission. We would like to \r\nassure him of our full cooperation. Please also allow \r\nme to pay tribute to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain for the skill with which she \r\nconducted the work of the sixty-first session.  \r\n I would also like to welcome the presence among \r\nus of Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations. I congratulate him on his accession to \r\nthis post of the highest prestige in our Organization. \r\nThe vast experience and the qualities of a diplomat that \r\nhe is known for are a guarantee of success in this lofty \r\nfunction. I am convinced that he will be able to work \r\nfor the benefit of our Organization in continuing the \r\nefforts of his predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan, to whom I \r\nwould like once again to pay tribute. \r\n The general debate in this Assembly is a special \r\nmoment in international life. Indeed, it is an \r\nopportunity every year for heads of Member States to \r\ntake stock of the world’s affairs, to exchange views in \r\nthis regard and to reflect the aspirations of their \r\nnations.  \r\n The sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly opens this year again in a rather troubled \r\ninternational context. At the dawn of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, the challenges facing humanity are more \r\npressing and more complex with each passing day, \r\ngiving rise alternatively to hope and fears.  \r\n The first of these challenges to which I would \r\nlike to refer here today has to do with peace and \r\nsecurity. International events today highlight even \r\nmore than before the paramount need to breathe new \r\nlife into efforts for disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\nNuclear proliferation is a threat, not only to \r\ninternational peace and security but also to the very \r\nsurvival of humankind. Attempts by terrorist \r\norganizations to acquire weapons of mass destruction \r\nare also indicative of the reality of this threat. \r\nTerrorism, indeed, is a particularly great danger to the \r\ninternational community, a threat that we can only face \r\nthrough concerted and resolute global action.  \r\n It is because of this conviction that Cameroon has \r\nin the past year contributed to the adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy. Once again, I would like to salute this historic \r\naccomplishment. For the first time, Member States \r\nhave decided to take up concrete political, operational \r\nand legal measures to coordinate their fight against \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 26 \r\n \r\nterrorism. They have committed themselves to \r\nstrengthening their capacity to react, as well as the \r\ncapability of the United Nations in this regard. They \r\nhave agreed to address situations that could lead to the \r\nextension of this scourge. Today, the problem is to \r\napply this fundamental text, both in letter and spirit. \r\nMy country would like to reaffirm its availability and \r\nits determination in terms of taking on commitments in \r\nthis work. \r\n In many regions around the world, peace and \r\nsecurity continue to be seriously threatened. For years \r\nnow, the unrest in the Middle East has been a serious \r\nthreat to international peace and security. The \r\nevolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict causes deep \r\nconcern. It is paramount that Israel and the Palestinian \r\nAuthority resume a constructive dialogue. That is the \r\nonly way, in the opinion of my country, to move \r\nforward toward a settlement. Cameroon is convinced \r\nthat only the efforts of all concerned parties, supported \r\nby the Great Powers and based on the principle of two \r\nStates — Israel and Palestine — coexisting in peace \r\nand security, will make it possible to reach a definitive, \r\nfair and just settlement to this conflict. \r\n In Lebanon, as in Iraq, reconciliation among the \r\nvarious communities of these countries is the only \r\nhope for a sustainable stability.  \r\n In Africa, in spite of initiatives undertaken by the \r\ninternational community, there remain a number of \r\nhotbeds of tension. Please allow me to highlight some \r\nof these.  \r\n The crisis in Côte d’Ivoire seems to be reaching a \r\nturning point. We are convinced that, with the firm and \r\nsincere commitment of all parties and the support of \r\nthe international community, this fraternal country will \r\nhave definitively turned a particularly painful page in \r\nits history. The people of Côte d’Ivoire, we are sure, \r\nwill be able to persevere in their choice of peace and \r\nnational reconciliation. It is extremely important that \r\nthey work together in good faith for a full and rapid \r\nimplementation of the Ouagadougou peace agreement. \r\n The situation in Somalia continues to threaten \r\npeace and security in the region. Cameroon is deeply \r\nconcerned by acts of violence in Somalia. We would \r\nlike to congratulate the mission of the African Union \r\nfor the support that it has extended to the Transitional \r\nFederal Institutions. We are sure that the speedy \r\ndeployment of the envisaged United Nations force will \r\ndefinitely have a positive effect on the stability in that \r\ncountry and on the security of the population.  \r\n The human toll of the Darfur crisis causes \r\nprofound concern. It seems to us of paramount \r\nimportance that all efforts be undertaken to break the \r\ntragic cycle of violence in that region. The effects of \r\nthe crisis have already been deeply felt by \r\nneighbouring States and threaten to extend further. It \r\nshould be understood that Cameroon welcomes the \r\nannouncement of the deployment of the hybrid United \r\nNations-African Union peacekeeping operation in \r\nDarfur. I am convinced that this operation will make it \r\npossible to stabilize the situation in the area and save \r\ninnocent lives. My country welcomes the fact that the \r\nGovernment of Sudan has unconditionally accepted the \r\ndeployment of this mission. In our opinion, this is a \r\ndecisive stage in the resolution of the crisis. At the \r\nsame time, Cameroon believes it is very important to \r\ncontinue efforts to address the causes of the conflict, \r\nby relaunching the political process and by \r\nimplementing a real programme of development in the \r\nregion, specifically by ensuring access to water \r\nresources. \r\n Cameroon follows with close attention the \r\ndevelopments in the situation in Chad and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. Those fraternal countries with which \r\nwe have long common borders have, for a number of \r\nyears, been facing instability fomented by various \r\ninsurgent groups. That situation poses a serious threat \r\nto peace and stability in those countries and to the \r\nsecurity and well-being of their populations and \r\ntriggers a true humanitarian tragedy in the region. It \r\nalso causes cross-border insecurity that affects other \r\ncountries in the region, including Cameroon. For that \r\nreason, my country resolutely supports the upcoming \r\ndeployment of a multidimensional presence of the \r\nUnited Nations and the European Union on the borders \r\nof Chad, the Central African Republic and the Sudan. I \r\nwish to reiterate from this rostrum that my country is \r\nready to cooperate fully with the United Nations in the \r\nimplementation of that operation. \r\n With regard to the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo we welcome the progress accomplished towards \r\npeace in terms of establishing democratic institutions \r\nin that country. The situation in the eastern part of the \r\ncountry continues to be a source of concern to the \r\ninternational community. It seems to us that seeking a \r\nsolution to the crisis of the two Kivus should be based \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n27 07-51956 \r\n \r\nfirst and foremost on political and diplomatic methods \r\ncorresponding to the problem at hand. \r\n The challenges we must face in terms of peace \r\nand security are considerable. However, they must not \r\neclipse in our minds the equally significant challenges \r\nconfronting us in other areas. It seems crucial to me \r\nthat every necessary effort be exerted to reach the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. This year we are \r\nreaching the midpoint of the timetable we have \r\nestablished for ourselves in that regard. It is very \r\nimportant that States live up to the commitments made, \r\nto the extent possible. The reduction in official \r\ndevelopment assistance in 2006 underlines the need for \r\ndonors to try to increase the level of their aid so that \r\nthe goals set for 2010 and 2015 may be reached. \r\n Furthermore, I wish again to state the hope that \r\nthe negotiations of the Doha Round are completed on \r\nschedule and ensure that the interests of the countries \r\nof the South are protected and that the globalization of \r\ntrade retains its significance. \r\n I cannot remain silent about the terrible \r\nexperience of thousands of young people from Africa \r\nwho, for a number of years now, have set forth at risk \r\nto their lives in their attempts to reach Europe — in \r\ntheir eyes the new promised land. That migration keeps \r\nincreasing and is of course attributable to the \r\ndifference in the level of development between the \r\nNorth and the South. In that regard, the countries of \r\norigin, the countries of transit and the receiving \r\ncountries must intervene to seek humane solutions that \r\ntake into account the underlying causes of that \r\nphenomenon. It is indeed clear that neither controls nor \r\nrepatriation will offer an adequate or sustainable \r\nresponse to the problem.  \r\n The issue of climate change is becoming one of \r\nthe most important and most urgent issues of our time, \r\nas has been recognized by all, and it is urgent that we \r\nact. The destinies of future generations depend on that. \r\nIn that context I wish to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his initiative in convening the High-level \r\nEvent on Climate Change, which has just been \r\nconcluded here. \r\n The holding of negotiations in December 2007 in \r\nBali, Indonesia, on the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and on the post-Kyoto \r\nregime should also be a focus of our attention. \r\nFurthermore, we welcome the intention of the Tunisian \r\nGovernment to organize from 18 to 20 November \r\n2007, an international conference on the effects of \r\nclimate change and strategies for adaptation on the \r\nAfrican continent and in the Mediterranean region. In \r\nthat domain we should try to reach a global agreement \r\nthat would be part of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention process and which would tackle the matter \r\nof climate change in all its aspects. \r\n The challenges we have just discussed can only \r\nbe taken up on a global scale. The United Nations \r\nshould be at the forefront of that struggle and for that \r\npurpose needs the active cooperation of all its \r\nMembers, particularly the great Powers. But it should \r\nalso constantly adapt itself to the changing realities of \r\nour time so as to be in a position to efficiently fulfil its \r\nmission.  \r\n Accordingly, Cameroon attaches the greatest \r\nimportance to the reform of the United Nations. It \r\nsupports a progressive, gradual reform of the current \r\nUnited Nations system which would take into account \r\nthe changing balances in the world in recent years and \r\nthe emergence of many new States. It is our intention \r\nto continue to cooperate with other Member States for \r\na renewed United Nations, a model of modern and \r\neffective governance, in its participation in world \r\naffairs. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cameroon for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\nGeneral debate \r\n Address by His Excellency Mr. Jan Peter \r\nBalkenende, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor General Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof the Netherlands. \r\n Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 28 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Balkenende (Netherlands): I would like to \r\nbegin by congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. I would also like to \r\nwish our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, every \r\nsuccess at his first full session of the General Assembly \r\nsince taking office. He has been very active in his first \r\nnine months. The Netherlands fully supports his efforts \r\nto promote peace and development in the world and to \r\nmake the United Nations more effective. \r\n I am convinced that the success or failure of the \r\nUnited Nations depends on three fundamental factors. \r\nThe first is how much inspiration we draw from our \r\ncommon values: respect for human rights, for the rule \r\nof law and for our planet. The second is how much we \r\nshoulder our responsibility as members of the \r\ninternational community. And the third is how \r\nsuccessful we are in making the United Nations more \r\nrelevant and in increasing the impact of the \r\ninternational community. I will deal with each of these \r\nthree themes in turn — respect, responsibility and \r\nrelevance. \r\n Next year it will be 60 years since the General \r\nAssembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights (resolution 217 A (III)). The values contained in \r\nthat Declaration and in the conventions based on it are \r\nour source of inspiration. In its preamble, the \r\nDeclaration sets out our mission: “the advent of a \r\nworld in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of \r\nspeech and belief and freedom from fear and want”. \r\nFor the past 60 years, those values have been our moral \r\ncompass, our common standard of achievement. \r\nWhatever our differences of opinion, we must never \r\nlose sight of that common ideal. We all agree that \r\nevery human being deserves a chance to build a good \r\nlife. Respect for human rights and the rule of law is our \r\ndeepest motive and our highest aspiration. Our \r\ndiversity rests on that unity. We should not hesitate to \r\nhold one another to account.  \r\n As we speak, the situation in one country in \r\nparticular calls for urgent action by the international \r\ncommunity. In Burma, the military are shooting at \r\nmonks and civilians, who are demonstrating peacefully. \r\nWe strongly condemn that brutal use of force. Together \r\nwith the European Union and the United States, we call \r\non the Security Council to discuss the situation \r\nurgently and to consider further steps, including \r\nsanctions. Should the Security Council not reach \r\nagreement, we will shoulder our responsibility. In that \r\ncase, I am convinced the European Union and the \r\nUnited States will decide on further measures, together \r\nwith other well-intentioned countries. \r\n When it comes to human rights and the rule of \r\nlaw, I am not talking about abstractions. Every child \r\nthat can go to school, every family that can live in \r\npeace and freedom with its neighbours and every \r\ncountry that enjoys prosperity and tolerance is a step \r\ntowards fulfilling our dream. \r\n Values connect us across our cultures and \r\nreligions. We must not allow cultural or religious \r\ndifferences to create barriers to open dialogue. Asma \r\nJahangir, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on \r\nfreedom of religion or belief, tells us that religious \r\nfreedom is under threat in many parts of the world. So, \r\nwe have a lot to do. \r\n The Netherlands wants to join forces with all \r\nthose who want to promote tolerance and dialogue \r\nbetween civilizations. But we must not allow that \r\ndialogue to put the universal validity of our common \r\nvalues in question. We know from experience how \r\nfundamental our shared values are. The Netherlands is \r\none country in the world. But in a sense, we are also \r\nthe world in one country. Our capital, Amsterdam, is \r\nhome to 177 nationalities. We have learned that only \r\nthrough unity in diversity can we make progress, \r\nlocally, nationally and internationally. That means that \r\nthe rule of law must be strictly enforced so that people \r\ncan feel safe. It also means that we need to be more \r\ntolerant and willing to take a critical look at ourselves. \r\nStressing our differences leads to polarization and \r\nsolves nothing.  \r\n We owe respect not only to one another, but also \r\nto our planet. It gives us everything we need, provided \r\nthat we treat its natural resources wisely and do not \r\nupset its natural balance. That is why sustainability is \r\none of our most important values. A value is not \r\nsomething that we possess. It is not an achievement \r\nthat we can boast about. A value is a task, an incentive \r\nto action. Cherishing values automatically means \r\naccepting responsibility. \r\n Membership of the United Nations goes hand in \r\nhand with moral responsibility. It means more than \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n29 07-51956 \r\n \r\nattending meetings and even paying our dues. It also \r\nmeans keeping our commitments. The treaties we sign \r\nmust not remain a dead letter. Human rights must be \r\nrespected. The Netherlands is proud to contribute, for \r\nexample as a member and a Vice-President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. \r\n In 2005 the United Nations adopted the principle \r\nof the responsibility to protect. In doing so, we sided \r\nwith all those suffering from genocide or crimes \r\nagainst humanity. It is now time to put that principle \r\ninto practice. The United Nations has a key \r\nresponsibility as a protector of peace and security. \r\nEach of us shares that responsibility. In this age of \r\nrapid communications and global linkage, nothing is \r\nfar away anymore. What happens elsewhere affects us \r\nall. \r\n We can only secure lasting peace in areas of \r\nconflict if we combine defence with development and \r\ndiplomacy. We are putting that concept into practice in \r\nthe Afghan province of Uruzgan, together with our \r\nAustralian partners and other allies. It is a difficult and \r\ndemanding mission under United Nations mandate. The \r\ninternational community must not abandon Afghanistan \r\nto its fate. The hopes of millions of Afghans rest with \r\nus. The United Nations needs to broaden and intensify \r\nits role in Afghanistan.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission has a vital role to \r\nplay in bridging the gap between conflict and \r\ndevelopment. In the past year, it has worked hard to \r\nhelp several African countries that are on the difficult \r\nroad of reconstruction after being torn apart by \r\nconflict. The Netherlands is actively supporting that \r\nvery promising approach, which focuses on prevention. \r\n Assembly President Kerim has drawn attention to \r\nanother responsibility we all share: the need for prompt \r\naction to tackle the problem of climate change. The \r\nindustrialized countries — and that means all of \r\nthem — should take the lead. But the countries that are \r\nnow enjoying rapid economic growth are also being \r\nasked to develop more sustainably. The future lies with \r\nthose countries that excel in energy conservation and \r\nthe use of cleaner technologies. We are not yet making \r\nsufficient use of the scope that innovation offers us.  \r\n The Netherlands wants to be a front-runner, not \r\nonly in our ambition to sharply reduce greenhouse gas \r\nemissions, but also in developing new strategies to deal \r\nwith the negative effects of climate change. It is \r\nimportant to take climate and nature into account in all \r\nour investments. The most vulnerable developing \r\ncountries deserve more support in tackling the \r\nproblems they face. \r\n In December, at the Bali Climate Change \r\nConference, the United Nations has a unique \r\nopportunity to take charge of the situation and create a \r\nunited global framework for addressing the climate \r\nproblem. European government leaders would like to \r\nsee negotiations start in Bali on a follow-up to Kyoto. \r\nThe Netherlands and its European partners will do all \r\nthey can to accomplish that. \r\n Responsibility also means ongoing efforts to \r\nmake the United Nations more relevant. The United \r\nNations is the platform for seeking global solutions to \r\nglobal problems. The world needs an effective United \r\nNations. How can we be more effective, efficient and \r\ncredible? We need to strengthen the rule of law and put \r\nan end to impunity. We are not yet making full use of \r\nthe instruments we have. I say this as Prime Minister of \r\na country that is proud to have the legal capital of the \r\nworld — The Hague — within its borders. Without \r\njustice, there can be no lasting peace and no \r\nreconciliation. We would like to see the jurisdiction of \r\nthe International Court of Justice and the International \r\nCriminal Court accepted more widely. We stress the \r\nneed for cooperation by both member and non-member \r\nStates with the International Criminal Court in general \r\nand with regard to the execution of arrest warrants in \r\nparticular. \r\n The Netherlands will continue to make a special \r\neffort to promote the international legal order. That is \r\nwhy we have responded positively to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s request to host the Lebanon tribunal in the \r\nNetherlands. Preparations for that tribunal are in full \r\nswing.  \r\n Enforcing the rule of law is not enough to make \r\nthe United Nations more relevant. We also need to keep \r\na critical eye on how we work. Let us resist the \r\ntemptation to invest too much energy in resolutions we \r\nadopt every year. It is better to invest in strengthening \r\nconfidence between North and South, West and East. \r\nPeople and resources are scarce. We can only spend \r\neach euro once. If we want to achieve our common \r\naims, such as the Millennium Development Goals, we \r\nneed to coordinate our efforts. \r\n Several dozen United Nations agencies are active \r\naround the world. We have planted a forest of United \r\nNations flags in various countries. We need a more \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 30 \r\n \r\nunified approach in order to help the poorest \r\ndeveloping countries more. We can work far more \r\nefficiently if we pool our resources in a single \r\nprogramme in each country. That makes demands on \r\ndonors. Several countries, including the Netherlands, \r\nnow fund various United Nations organizations on the \r\nbasis of multi-year plans. I hope that others will follow \r\nsuit. \r\n The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts to reform the United Nations system and the \r\nSecurity Council. Reforms are never easy, but they are \r\nessential. In a world that is changing at breakneck \r\nspeed, we need multilateral institutions that can \r\nrespond to new developments. A relevant United \r\nNations means a dynamic United Nations with \r\ndynamic institutions. \r\n Reforms are sometimes seen as giving up \r\ncertainties. I am convinced that we need to reform in \r\norder to safeguard what we all hold dear: respect for \r\nhuman rights, enforcement of the rule of law and \r\nsustainable development for all nations. Those values \r\nare the lifeblood of the United Nations. Respect for our \r\nvalues means taking joint responsibility. Responsibility \r\nmeans a constant effort to make the United Nations \r\nmore relevant. We want our values to take concrete \r\nform in the twenty-first century in people’s lives and in \r\ninternational relations. That demands unity of purpose, \r\ncourage and resolution from us all. Above all, it \r\nrequires ambition, the ambition to make a determined \r\neffort — while respecting our differences — to realize \r\nour common ideals. What we need in the twenty-first \r\ncentury is united values, united ideals, a united world \r\nand the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n His Excellency Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Sheikh Mohammad Al-Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the State of Kuwait. \r\n Mr. Sheikh Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Kuwait congratulates Mr. Srgjan Kerim upon \r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-second session, and recalls with \r\nappreciation the efforts of his predecessor, Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, and her \r\nsuccessful conduct of the work of the sixty-first \r\nsession. \r\n Despite the fact that two years have elapsed since \r\nthe 2005 World Summit and seven years since the \r\nMillennium Summit, we continue to confront \r\nchallenges and dangers to international peace and \r\nsecurity, such as terrorism, poverty, hunger, the spread \r\nof dangerous infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and \r\nmalaria, deterioration of the environment and \r\nviolations of human rights. Recent times have seen a \r\nnumber of outstanding achievements, most important \r\namong them the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, the Human Rights Council, the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund and the United Nations \r\nDemocracy Fund, and the introduction of \r\nadministrative and financial reforms of the work of the \r\nSecretariat. These were all necessary achievements, but \r\nthey are not enough to combat terrorism, eliminate \r\nweapons of mass destruction, affect climate change and \r\nachieve sustainable development in the developing \r\ncountries, including the least developed among them. \r\n Moreover, the revival of racial bias, religious \r\nsedition, incitement of hatred and xenophobia represent \r\na serious threat to international peace and security. The \r\nOrganization must be strong in confronting that threat \r\nseriously and firmly. \r\n The time has come for us to change our method \r\nand approach in dealing with these universal \r\nchallenges and dangers and to move from the phase of \r\ndetermining what should be done to the phase of actual \r\nwork and the faithful fulfilment of the commitments \r\nwe have taken upon ourselves at international \r\nconferences and in international agreements and \r\nconventions that we have signed and ratified. \r\n The State of Kuwait has made good progress in \r\ntranslating the commitments and resolutions of the \r\n2005 World Summit into tangible realities. It has also \r\nattained the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nparticularly in the fields of education, health and \r\nadvancing the role of women in society. It has designed \r\npolicies capable of uplifting society and achieving \r\nfurther progress and social and economic development, \r\nas well as raising the standard of living of individuals. \r\nSuch policies contribute to efforts to consolidate the \r\n A/62/PV.8\r\n \r\n31 07-51956 \r\n \r\nprinciples of tolerance, moderation and the rejection of \r\nfanaticism. \r\n Based upon the State of Kuwait’s absolute belief \r\nin the human values of supporting the downtrodden \r\nand helping the needy, my country has, since its \r\nindependence, implemented a generous aid programme \r\nfor developing countries. In 1961, it established the \r\nKuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, which \r\nhas financed hundreds of infrastructure projects in \r\nmore than 100 countries. The value of those projects \r\nexceeds $12 billion.  \r\n The State of Kuwait is also committed to \r\nproviding annual voluntary contributions to numerous \r\ninternational specialized agencies and organizations, as \r\nwell as to regional organizations and funds that assist \r\ndeveloping countries in achieving their development \r\ngoals. Recently, the State of Kuwait allocated $300 \r\nmillion to the Islamic Development Bank for the \r\nelimination of poverty in Africa. That is in addition to \r\nwhat we contribute in humanitarian and relief aid to \r\nmany countries ravaged by natural disasters.  \r\n It is regrettable that poverty, hunger and disease \r\npersist in developing countries. It is even more painful \r\nto see that more than half of the world’s population is \r\nliving on less than $2 per day — a matter that requires \r\nserious examination and a real review of the \r\nimpediments to development in developing countries. \r\nIn that connection, the State of Kuwait calls upon the \r\nWorld Trade Organization and the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions to ease the restrictions imposed on exports \r\nfrom developing countries and to propose a more just \r\nand equitable trading system for least developed and \r\npoorest countries. \r\n Kuwait is following with concern the \r\ndevelopments in the situation in Iraq. We welcome the \r\nimprovements in security conditions in some areas and \r\nprovinces of Iraq, as a result of the implementation of \r\nrelevant arrangements and a security enforcement plan \r\ncarried out by the international forces in Iraq with the \r\nparticipation of Iraqi security forces. But there is still a \r\ndire need to redouble efforts at all levels, particularly \r\non the political track, in order to address the security \r\nchallenges posed by terrorist operations that target \r\ncivilians, houses of worship and State institutions and \r\nthat cost the lives of scores of innocent people daily. It \r\nis our hope that the Iraqi Government’s efforts to \r\nachieve national reconciliation will be successful and \r\nproduce positive results that can lead to a \r\ncomprehensive national consensus in Iraq that takes \r\ninto consideration the concerns and the rights of all \r\nsectors of the Iraqi people. National reconciliation is \r\nthe only way to build a democratic, free, secure and \r\nindependent Iraq that is at peace with itself and its \r\nneighbours and that respects its international \r\nobligations and commitments. \r\n In that context, we welcome the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1770 (2007), which \r\nconsolidated the duties and the mandate of the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission for Iraq. We look forward \r\nto the international community playing its vital role in \r\nhelping Iraq to fulfil its political and economic \r\nobligations within the context of the International \r\nCompact with Iraq. \r\n With regard to the issue of the three occupied \r\nEmirati islands, Kuwait would like to reaffirm its \r\nsupport for the position of the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil on this issue. We hope that efforts and contacts \r\nat all levels will intensify between the sisterly United \r\nArab Emirates and the friendly Islamic Republic of \r\nIran in order to find a solution to this dispute consistent \r\nwith the principles and rules of international law and \r\ngood-neighbourly relations, thereby contributing to \r\nstrengthening the security and stability of the region. \r\n The Middle East crisis has been stagnant since \r\nthe middle of the past century. The plight of the \r\nPalestinian people continues: their rights are violated, \r\ntheir lands are occupied and Security Council \r\nresolutions are frozen — despite intensive international \r\nand regional efforts to revive the Middle East peace \r\nprocess. The Israeli Government, instead of putting \r\nconfidence-building measures in place, continues to \r\ncreate obstacles that serve to increase tensions and \r\nviolence and that hinder the establishment of a climate \r\nconducive to moving the peace process ahead. Do \r\ncontinuing settlement activities help to achieve peace \r\nmore quickly? Do the policies of detention, land \r\nconfiscation, curfews, closures and restrictions of \r\nmovement promote an environment of trust and \r\nstability? The answer is definitely no. Who could think \r\nthat this conflict is subject to the principles of a zero-\r\nsum game? Anyone who thinks that Israel will achieve \r\nsecurity for itself at the expense of the security of the \r\nPalestinian people is making a serious mistake. \r\nSecurity must be for everyone. There will be no \r\nsecurity except through the implementation of \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy.  \r\nA/62/PV.8  \r\n \r\n07-51956 32 \r\n \r\n The State of Kuwait therefore reiterates its \r\nsupport for the convening of an international \r\nconference with the participation of all the parties \r\nconcerned in the peace process. That meeting should \r\nfollow the terms of reference of the Madrid \r\nConference — including the provisions of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) — the \r\nprinciple of land for peace, the Road Map endorsed by \r\nthe Security Council in its resolution 1515 (2003) and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative. The comprehensive, just and \r\nlasting peace that the international community seeks to \r\nachieve must ensure that the Palestinian people attain \r\nall their legitimate political rights. That includes the \r\nestablishment of their own independent State on their \r\nown land, with Jerusalem as its capital. It must also \r\ninclude Israel’s withdrawal from all the Arab land \r\noccupied since 1967, including the Syrian Golan \r\nHeights.  \r\n Turning to Lebanon, we congratulate the \r\nLebanese Government on its success in putting a \r\ndecisive end to the Nahr Al-Bared sedition. We would \r\nalso like to express our gratitude to the Lebanese army, \r\nwhich dealt with that sedition ably and firmly. We hope \r\nthat that accomplishment will contribute to the return \r\nof all Lebanese parties to the negotiating table and the \r\nresumption of a Lebanese national dialogue to address \r\nthe issue of presidential entitlement and the political \r\nprocess, in accordance with the constitution.  \r\n While we commend the regional and international \r\nefforts to achieve national reconciliation among all \r\nLebanese parties, we condemn the political \r\nassassinations and the recurrent terrorist bombings \r\naimed at disrupting peace and stability in that sisterly \r\ncountry. We renew Kuwait’s commitment to stand by \r\nLebanon and to support it in a manner that will \r\n \r\npreserve its security, unity, territorial integrity and \r\npolitical independence. \r\n As for developments on the Iranian nuclear issue, \r\nwe reaffirm our firm belief in the need to respect \r\ninternationally recognized principles, including that of \r\nresolving conflicts through peaceful means. The State \r\nof Kuwait calls upon the international community to \r\ncoordinate its efforts and to continue to work towards \r\nachieving a peaceful resolution of this crisis, so as to \r\nsafeguard the peace and stability of the Gulf region. \r\nWe also welcome the recent agreement reached \r\nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as an \r\nimportant step towards dispelling fears and doubts \r\nsurrounding the Iranian nuclear programme. It is our \r\nhope that dialogue and cooperation will resume with \r\ntotal transparency. That would allow us to address all \r\nthe elements of this issue, so as to foster the conditions \r\nconducive to making the Middle East a zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\n In that connection, we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to exert pressure on Israel to join the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to \r\nplace all of its nuclear facilities under IAEA \r\nsafeguards. We emphasize the right of all the States of \r\nthe region to obtain the technology and know-how \r\nnecessary to peacefully utilize nuclear energy in \r\naccordance with the terms specified by relevant \r\ninternational conventions. \r\n Finally, we renew our commitment to work \r\nthrough the United Nations to fulfil the hopes and \r\naspirations of our peoples to live together in a world \r\nwhere peace, justice and equality prevail. \r\n The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
