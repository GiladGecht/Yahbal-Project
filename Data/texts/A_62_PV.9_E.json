(Botswana) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Merafhe \r\n(Botswana), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, President of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau. \r\n  Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Vieira (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): First of all, I would \r\nlike to congratulate the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly. His great attributes will contribute greatly to \r\nthe success of our work. I would like to assure him of \r\nthe constant support of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau \r\nin the realization of his noble mission. \r\n I would also like to extend my warm \r\ncongratulations to the President’s predecessor, Sheikha \r\nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain, for the talent and \r\ncompetence she displayed during her tenure. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nextend my congratulations to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for the excellent work he has done since his \r\nelection. We fully agree with the contents of his report \r\nand with his analysis of the international situation. We \r\nendorse the measures he has recommended. \r\n The prevention and peaceful resolution of \r\nconflicts and the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security occupy a central position in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. It is therefore the duty of all \r\nMember States to make efforts to achieve those noble \r\nobjectives. We believe that the establishment of an \r\ninternational coalition for peace, international security \r\nand the promotion and defence of human rights is the \r\nideal way to promote efforts towards the resolution of \r\nconflict. \r\n Terrorism and drug trafficking are scourges that \r\nthreaten all of us and can even gravely affect the \r\nstability of a country. Guinea-Bissau, like many other \r\ncountries in West Africa, is confronting the \r\nphenomenon of drug trafficking. The weakened \r\ninfrastructure of the State and the problems we face in \r\ncontrolling our borders — in particular our waters — \r\nhave made it possible for drug traffickers and other \r\norganized crime elements to flourish in our country. \r\nThat has resulted in many sorts of difficulties for our \r\nauthorities, to the point of damaging Guinea-Bissau’s \r\nimage and putting at risk our relations with the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Despite the Government’s political will and \r\ndetermination to combat drug trafficking, we have not \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 2 \r\n \r\nbeen able to put an end to this scourge. Its eradication \r\nwill only be possible through international cooperation. \r\nThe emergency plan to combat drug trafficking \r\ndeveloped by my Government illustrates my country’s \r\ndetermination to make the fight against the trafficking \r\nof drugs and organized crime a national objective. \r\nUnfortunately, however, we do not have the trained \r\nhuman resources or the material and financial means \r\nneeded to carry it out. \r\n I am pleased that an international conference on \r\ndrug trafficking in West Africa will take place soon. \r\nWe would like to thank the Portuguese Government for \r\nits willingness to host it in Lisbon. Likewise, a regional \r\nconference to be held in Dakar will seek to promote \r\nbetter coordination between the countries of the \r\nsubregion.  \r\n I would like to launch an appeal to all countries \r\nable to share their experience and technology relating \r\nto drug trafficking and organized crime to assist us in \r\nthe fight against those criminal activities, which \r\njeopardize the internal security and stability of our \r\ncountries and pose a great danger to our young people. \r\nIn that regard, I welcome the efforts of the United \r\nNations system to establish a genuine international \r\nnetwork to eradicate this scourge. \r\n The Government of Guinea-Bissau has decided to \r\nlaunch programme to address problems in the financial \r\nsector that will serve as an adjustment instrument \r\nvis-à-vis international financial institutions. That step \r\nwill certainly allow us to re-establish and strengthen \r\nthe framework for interaction and external partnerships \r\nof cooperation for development. The approval of a \r\npost-conflict programme by the Executive Board of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund will be an important step \r\ntowards achieving the country’s economic recovery \r\nand stabilization. \r\n We are aware of our responsibilities to manage \r\ntransparently the meagre resources at our disposal and \r\nto combat corruption through good governance based \r\non true democracy. \r\n The disbursement of pledges made during the \r\ndonors’ conference for Guinea-Bissau in Geneva last \r\nNovember is much-needed in the political and \r\ninstitutional stabilization of our country. It goes \r\nwithout saying that without the firm support of the \r\ninternational community, it will be difficult for us to \r\nput in place the conditions necessary for the \r\nconsolidation of stability and for the promotion of true \r\nnational political reconciliation, which is essential if \r\nwe are to preserve peace and achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Guinea-Bissau. \r\n Allow me to pay tribute to subregional \r\norganizations such as the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States and the West African Economic \r\nand Monetary Union for their constant support and \r\nsolidarity, from which we have benefited in our efforts \r\nto confront the enormous political, economic and \r\nfinancial difficulties we face. I would also like to \r\nwelcome the important contribution made by the \r\nInternational Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau to \r\nimprove dialogue between international development \r\npartners and to mobilize external assistance for my \r\ncountry at a particularly difficult moment in our recent \r\nhistory. \r\n It is also important to emphasize the role played \r\nby the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. \r\n I wish to express our thanks for the contribution \r\nof the United Nations system in general, as well as that \r\nof the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in \r\nGuinea-Bissau (UNOGBIS) in particular, in the \r\nprocess of establishing peace and political stability in \r\nour country. \r\n The relationship between the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries and the United Nations \r\nhas been developing in a steady and satisfactory \r\nmanner. We draw attention to the progress already \r\nmade in consolidating democracy and the rule of law \r\nas well as in promoting respect for human rights in the \r\nCommunity. This constitutes a marked change in the \r\nlife of the peoples of its member States. Indeed, our \r\neight countries — Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe \r\nand Timor-Leste — are committed to pooling together \r\ntheir affinities and their cultural identities in order to \r\nestablish a forum for exchange, in a spirit of constant \r\nand active solidarity. My country, Guinea-Bissau, has \r\nbenefited from the support of these sister countries in \r\ntackling the many difficulties I have outlined. On \r\nbehalf of the people of Guinea-Bissau, I warmly \r\ncommend the leaders present here, and thank them, \r\nreiterating our determination to strengthen the \r\nhistorical ties of friendship and cooperation among our \r\npeoples. \r\n Allow me also to reaffirm our determination to \r\ncontribute to strengthening the role of the United \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n3 07-51962 \r\n \r\nNations in attaining peace, international stability and \r\ndevelopment. We support the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes and the promotion of dialogue in all \r\ncircumstances and situations. History teaches us that \r\nchange, because it is inescapable, cannot be hindered \r\nindefinitely.  \r\n China is one nation, one people. The People’s \r\nRepublic of China’s contribution to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and its partnership, \r\nespecially with regard to cooperation for development, \r\nare exemplary. The People’s Republic of China is the \r\nsole, legitimate and true representative of the Chinese \r\npeople. \r\n We are aware of the problems and the difficulties \r\nwhich we confront in the world in general, and in \r\nAfrica in particular, where conflict situations and \r\nhumanitarian crises persist, as in Darfur and in \r\nSomalia. We hope that a new spirit of cooperation will \r\nprevail within the international community so that a \r\nlasting solution and peace can be found in the Middle \r\nEast. \r\n We therefore need an effective Organization that \r\nrepresents the geographical, cultural and religious \r\ndiversity of the world, an Organization that takes into \r\nconsideration and defends with equal commitment and \r\ndetermination the legitimate aspirations of a large \r\nnumber of countries for just representation and \r\nparticipation in the deliberations and decision-making \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia. \r\n  Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the Federation of \r\nthe States of Micronesia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Emanuel Mori, President \r\nof the Federated States of Micronesia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mori: I am honoured to take part in \r\nthe general debate of the General Assembly for the first \r\ntime since taking office as President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia in May this year. On this \r\noccasion, I am honoured to express to Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim my respect and congratulations on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. I have every confidence that he will \r\nlive up to the high standards of his esteemed \r\npredecessors. I wish to also convey my congratulations \r\nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, as he takes the helm of the Organization. I \r\npledge to the Secretary-General my Government’s \r\nstrong support. I wish to reaffirm our commitments and \r\nthe importance that my country attaches to \r\nmultilateralism and the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n A few days ago, on 24 September, we met in this \r\nvery Hall to take stock of a global threat which \r\nprobably is the single most important challenge facing \r\nour planet today: climate change. Long before it \r\nbecame fashionable for climate change to be \r\nmainstreamed into the global agenda, Micronesia was \r\nin the forefront of those speaking out for action against \r\nwhat is now recognized as a global emergency. For \r\nyears, we have argued that, as a small island \r\ndeveloping State, we are among the most vulnerable, \r\nand that climate change threatens our very existence. \r\n We have come a long way in a short time. \r\nConsider where we were just 15 years ago when the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (UNFCCC) was signed: climate change was \r\nthen considered by most as hypothetical and as a threat \r\nthat was more imagined than real. Now, climate change \r\nis accepted as a reality and its adverse impact seen as \r\ninevitable and life-threatening, most especially to small \r\nisland developing States like Micronesia. The current \r\nsense of urgency paid to climate change by the world \r\ncommunity, as evidenced by high-level meetings \r\naround the world, is truly encouraging, but we are still \r\nfar from reaching the objectives of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and its \r\nKyoto Protocol. \r\n We need to take collective action now and act \r\nresponsibly to save our planet, while taking into \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 4 \r\n \r\nconsideration the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibility. If our actions are to be \r\neffective, it is imperative that we pursue the climate \r\nchange agenda both with a sense of urgency and within \r\nthe framework of the United Nations. It is important \r\nthat acknowledgment of the threats of climate change \r\nbe accompanied by provision of adequate and \r\nadditional financing by the developed countries to the \r\nmost vulnerable to assist us in coping with our \r\nadaptation and mitigation requirements. We therefore \r\nsupport an appropriate institutional arrangement for the \r\nAdaptation Fund that is responsive to the needs of \r\nsmall island developing States. \r\n Adaptation and mitigation have many faces, one \r\nof which is the pressing need for small island \r\ndeveloping States to have increased access to \r\nrenewable sources of energy, so that we can move \r\naway from our long dependence on fossil fuels. In that \r\nregard, I must acknowledge with gratitude the kind \r\nassistance extended by the Governments of Italy, India \r\nand others to small island developing States of the \r\nPacific. \r\n In March, Micronesia presented its proposal for \r\nadjusting the Montreal Protocol in order to enhance its \r\neffectiveness. Although our proposed adjustment was \r\naimed at improving the effectiveness of the Protocol’s \r\nozone mandate, Micronesia has a special interest in the \r\nsignificant climate benefits associated with the \r\nMontreal Protocol. We welcome the positive outcome \r\nof the historic nineteenth Meeting of the Parties. We \r\nhope that other relevant multilateral environmental \r\nagreements will also make similar efforts to produce \r\nclimate benefits. \r\n Two years ago, at the eighth Conference of the \r\nStates Parties to the Convention on Biological \r\nDiversity, which was held in Curitiba, Brazil, the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia and Palau showcased \r\nthe Micronesia Challenge. A collaborative effort among \r\nthe island States and territories of the North Pacific, \r\nthe Micronesia Challenge exemplifies the best of the \r\nMicronesian spirit of working together towards a \r\ncommon objective and with shared concerns. In effect, \r\nthe Micronesia Challenge sets aside for conservation at \r\nleast 30 per cent of our marine and 20 per cent of \r\nterrestrial biodiversity across the Micronesian region \r\nby 2020. \r\n We are grateful to the regional and international \r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations that \r\nhave provided support to realize the objectives of our \r\ninitiative. We are seeking international partnership and \r\nassistance to overcome the many obstacles that inhibit \r\nthe implementation of the Micronesia Challenge. My \r\nGovernment urges the Global Environment Facility to \r\njoin with others — such as the Government of \r\nTurkey — in providing assistance to that end. \r\n I cannot overemphasize the critical role that \r\ninformation and communication technologies play in \r\nthe socio-economic development of developing \r\ncountries, particularly that of small island developing \r\nStates. Given that the islands of the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia are widely dispersed in the north-west \r\nPacific Ocean, and owing to our limited resources and \r\nhigh transportation costs, we face many monumental \r\nchallenges. To confront those challenges, Micronesia \r\nbelieves that access to affordable and reliable \r\ninformation and communication technologies offers us \r\na solution that not only addresses our infrastructure \r\ndeficiencies but also enables us to meet the aims of the \r\nMillennium Declaration, the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and the objectives relating to \r\ninformation and communication technologies \r\nemanating from the World Summit on the Information \r\nSociety.  \r\n It is a high priority of my country to bring \r\nbroadband connectivity to the islands. The Economic \r\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and \r\nthe United Nations Office of the High Representative \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing \r\nStates are collaborating on the development of a \r\nPacific Ocean connectivity project that will address the \r\nneed for developing information and communication \r\ntechnologies infrastructure in the Pacific. We hope that \r\nthe project will allow our region to establish an \r\neffective partnership with the international community \r\nand help produce the kind of benefits that will help \r\nsupport our sustainable development goals. We will \r\nnot, however, be able to implement the project without \r\nthe financial support of the international community. \r\n I commend the progress on the United Nations \r\nPacific Presence Initiative, which in the case of my \r\ncountry is being represented by the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA). For the past several years, \r\nwe have voiced our concern over the lack of an \r\nadequate United Nations presence in Micronesia to \r\nassist us in addressing our development challenges. \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n5 07-51962 \r\n \r\nThis much-anticipated initiative will be translated into \r\nreality for Micronesia later this year. It is an initiative \r\nthat we will not fail to utilize to the fullest. It is \r\ntherefore essential that, in keeping with the objective \r\nof the joint office to be situated in my country, the \r\noriginal intent with regard to staffing must be adhered \r\nto if the Initiative is going to make a difference, both in \r\nterms of the effective implementation of United \r\nNations programmes on the ground and in enhancing \r\nmy country’s capacity to access its fair share of other \r\nsources of assistance and services provided by the \r\nUnited Nations system.  \r\n As one of the countries identified by UNDP as \r\nbeing among those more challenged in meeting the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, my country places \r\nhigh value on an appropriate level of United Nations \r\npresence in the joint office located in my country to \r\nassist us in implementation and effectively utilizing \r\nexternal assistance towards achieving the MDGs. My \r\nGovernment commends UNDP and UNFPA for \r\ndeveloping a plan for the next five-year programme \r\ncycle that will provide financial assistance to help my \r\ncountry address issues of poverty and institutional \r\ncapacity. The joint United Nations office will be an \r\nimportant vehicle and will certainly play a pivotal role \r\nin the implementation and achievement of the specific \r\nobjectives of the programme. We look forward to the \r\nimplementation of the programme. \r\n As custodian of a vast ocean area whose bounty \r\nwe share with the international community, I would be \r\nremiss if I did not make a few comments on the issue \r\nof oceans and seas. First, I would like to express our \r\ngratitude to the Government of Norway and others that \r\nhave contributed to the trust fund created to assist \r\nsmall island developing States in claiming their \r\nextended continental shelves in compliance with the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We \r\nare, however, concerned about the obstacles that \r\ncontinue to inhibit access to the fund. There are far too \r\nmany institutional barriers that need to be immediately \r\nrectified to enable use of the fund to allow island \r\ndeveloping States to fulfil their obligations under the \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n As a people, Micronesians are highly dependent \r\non their marine resources for their livelihood. We take \r\ngreat interest in the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nour marine and fisheries resources. We cannot help but \r\nraise concerns with regard to the issue of collateral \r\ncatches or discards in commercial fisheries. While they \r\nmay be considered discards to others, they are a critical \r\nresource that our people depend upon for their \r\nsubsistence living. The international community should \r\nvigorously seek ways to address this issue to minimize \r\nand eliminate the incidence of catching untargeted fish. \r\nAnother significant and troubling issue continues to be \r\nthat of bottom-trawl fishing. It would be tragic to our \r\nmarine ecosystem and biodiversity if that destructive \r\nfishing practice were to continue unabated. We renew \r\nour call, made from this rostrum years ago, for a \r\nmoratorium on bottom trawling. \r\n I wish to refer favourably to the long-standing \r\neffort by Italy and many others to encourage this body \r\nto take a consensus position against the imposition of \r\nthe death penalty. Last year, my country signed the \r\nstatement delivered by Finland on this important \r\nsubject (see A/61/PV.81). We steadfastly maintain our \r\nsupport for this cause. \r\n Turning to the drawn-out discussion over United \r\nNations reform, I should like to reiterate our concern \r\nthat the reform of the United Nations will not be \r\ncomplete without the reform of the Security Council. \r\nWe also reaffirm our support for Japan and India, from \r\nthe Asia-Pacific region, as permanent members of the \r\nCouncil. At the same time, greater representation needs \r\nto be given to developing countries, including island \r\nStates and small States. \r\n While we continue to stand by our position on \r\nSecurity Council reform, we will support any \r\ninnovative ideas that can lead to further progress on the \r\nissue, such as the proposal for an intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process. At the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, we must continue the process \r\nalready begun and make every effort to achieve results. \r\n I should like to close by expressing a sense of \r\noptimism about what the nations gathered here can \r\nachieve in advancing the admittedly ambitious agenda \r\nof the United Nations. Given the challenges that we \r\nface, it is only through optimism and determination \r\nover time that we can overcome them. We in the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia will be here to do our \r\npart. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 6 \r\n \r\n  Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ludwig Scotty, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nNauru. \r\n  Mr. Ludwig Scotty, President of the Republic of \r\nNauru, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ludwig Scotty, President \r\nof the Republic of Nauru, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Scotty: I would like to express my \r\nsincere congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. My delegation also wishes to \r\ncommend his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed \r\nAl-Khalifa, for her leadership of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-first session, particularly in addressing the \r\ndifficult issues that continue to prevent revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly and reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. My delegation offers its full cooperation and \r\nsupport towards the President’s commitment to \r\ncontinuing with the Organization’s overall reform \r\nagenda and addressing the many challenges ahead. \r\n As this is the first General Assembly session to \r\nbe convened since the appointment of His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General, my delegation \r\ntakes this opportunity to assure him of Nauru’s firm \r\nsupport and full cooperation in his leadership of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n I am deeply honoured to be addressing this body \r\nfor the third consecutive year, this time as the recently \r\nreturned leader of our small island State of Nauru. As \r\nmembers are no doubt aware, when I first took up \r\noffice, three years ago, my country was on the brink of \r\ncollapse. While Nauru was once a small donor country \r\nwith a high income, our wealth was squandered in a \r\nsingle generation through gross mismanagement and \r\ncorruption on the part of previous Governments. Our \r\npast record of poor governance and the need to rebuild \r\nNauru were the main reasons that our national \r\nsustainable development strategy was initiated by our \r\nGovernment and given one of its fundamental goals: \r\nthe establishment and operation of a transparent and \r\naccountable Government. \r\n My Government is slowly but diligently working \r\nto improve Nauru. Over our three-year term, we will \r\ncontinue to do so, on a platform of both economic and \r\npolitical reform, together with good governance. We \r\nbelieve that we are improving our situation, and the \r\nAugust election results tell us that we have our \r\npeople’s confidence. But it is a slow and painful \r\nrecovery, and we appreciate all the help that we can \r\nget. \r\n We appreciate the fact that the United Nations is \r\nstrongly aware of the development challenges in the \r\nPacific region and that it is also cognizant that \r\nassistance has not translated into uniform human \r\ndevelopment gains in many places, with the result that \r\nthe Pacific is in danger of missing many targets of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that \r\nrespect, my delegation welcomes and supports the \r\nPresident’s intention to hold a leaders’ meeting on the \r\nMDGs during the present session. \r\n During the general debate at the sixty-first \r\nsession (see A/61/PV.16), we noted in this historic Hall \r\nthat the offices and agencies of the United Nations had \r\nno permanent presence in many of the small island \r\ndeveloping States of the Pacific. In June 2006, it was \r\nannounced that a coalition comprising the United \r\nNations Development Programme, UNICEF and the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund would open a total of \r\neight new offices in Pacific island countries, including \r\nmy own country, Nauru. We welcomed that historic \r\nannouncement, the progress that it marked towards \r\nharmonization with the United Nations and the \r\nassistance and support that the new offices would \r\nprovide in developing national capacity and meeting \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n As Member States that pay our dues, deploy \r\npeacekeepers and discharge our responsibilities in the \r\ninternational community, we deserve offices that \r\nenhance the relevance of the United Nations and the \r\nimplementation of its policies. We have therefore been \r\nseverely disappointed by the lack of progress in \r\nestablishing acceptable offices in our countries since \r\nthe announcement. The delaying of that initiative, and \r\nthe assumptions on the part of the United Nations \r\nconcerning the capabilities of our small island States to \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n7 07-51962 \r\n \r\nrecruit staff for such offices, are also short-sighted. \r\nMoreover, the Organization’s definition of \r\n“partnership” for the initiative places a significant \r\nburden on our national Governments. It fails to respond \r\nto our national priorities and our lack of resources, and \r\ntherefore weakens the cohesion between the \r\nOrganization and our countries. \r\n Despite the lack of visible progress, we are of the \r\nview that the project can be salvaged with its original \r\nintentions and goals intact if there is a will and a \r\nsincere desire to respond to our needs. So we ask the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat to ensure that \r\noffices befitting the ideals and the reputation of the \r\nUnited Nations are opened in our countries. We want to \r\nsee the United Nations on the ground in Nauru and \r\nthroughout the Pacific region, providing a helping hand \r\nin our pursuit of sustainable development. \r\n There can be no doubt that our Pacific region is \r\ndoing its best to implement the commitments made \r\nunder the Mauritius Strategy and other international \r\nagreements regarding small island developing States. \r\nThe relevant report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/62/279) makes that very clear, showing that under \r\nits Pacific Plan, the Pacific region has agreed to and is \r\nvigorously pursuing its own sustainable development \r\npriorities, which reflect and acknowledge our \r\ninternational commitments under the Strategy. The \r\nSecretary-General’s report and the Pacific Plan updates \r\nshow progress in some key areas and identify \r\nimportant initiatives for follow-up action. \r\n However, it is also quite clear that we and the \r\nUnited Nations need to do much more. That fact is \r\nglaringly obvious in the recent report of the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \r\nwhich warns of a narrowing window of opportunity \r\navailable for slowing down global warming and \r\nclimate change. This is an issue that reveals some of \r\nthe inequities in the current world development \r\nparadigm: the small island countries contribute very \r\nlittle to the problem but are likely to be the worst \r\naffected. \r\n The need to do more also stares us in the face \r\nfrom recent reports on the progress, or lack thereof, in \r\nachieving MDGs. Our region is struggling in many \r\nareas of the MDGs, and it is fair to say, as the \r\nSecretary-General’s report notes, that persistent \r\ncapacity constraints are a key obstacle to the \r\nimplementation of sustainable development in the \r\nPacific region — this includes Nauru. \r\n Therefore, I take this opportunity to express my \r\npeople’s warmest appreciation to our development \r\npartners, led by Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, \r\nJapan, the European Union and others, for their support \r\nin this and other areas, without which we would have \r\ncompletely collapsed as a nation and as a people. \r\nHowever, I hope the Assembly can appreciate that our \r\nregion, although vast, suffers both from isolation and \r\nthe relatively small size of its countries and \r\npopulations.  \r\n Even with the best practices in management and \r\ngovernance, our economies’ sustainable development is \r\nimpeded by high transportation costs and diseconomies \r\nof scale. In Nauru, freight adds at least 15 to 20 per \r\ncent to the cost of all imports. Likewise, affordable and \r\nsustainable alternative energy forms are a high priority \r\nfor my country and region because, with the ever \r\nincreasing cost of fossil fuel, we are having to pay a \r\nhigh premium for something that contributes both to \r\nglobal warming and to our potential demise as Pacific \r\nislands.  \r\n Professor Jeffrey Sachs has rightly said that, \r\nwhile we all need to work together to solve world \r\npoverty, the opportunity is there for the developed \r\ncountries with their resources and technology to do \r\nsomething about ending it once and for all. The agreed \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per \r\ncent of a gross national product is far from being \r\nachieved. This highlights the opportunity for the world \r\nto do much more to both alleviate poverty and remove \r\nthe constraints that frustrate the progress of many \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Like other highly indebted countries, mine is \r\ndoubly burdened by a massive debt left to us by \r\nprevious Governments. After careful assessment of \r\nNauru’s development potential for the next thirty years, \r\nwe have come to the sad conclusion that Nauru will \r\nonly be able to service a very small portion of that \r\ndebt. We will need to seek the forgiveness of those \r\ncountries and institutions to which we owe most of the \r\nmoney.  \r\n This Organization prides itself on being inclusive \r\nand on being a champion to everyone; yet my \r\ndelegation is extremely disappointed that, despite the \r\nefforts of Nauru and other allies of this cause, the \r\nUnited Nations continues to ignore the expressed wish \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 8 \r\n \r\nof Taiwan and its 23 million people to become a \r\nmember of this Organization. \r\n On the 19 July this year, an application for \r\nmembership to the United Nations was delivered to the \r\nOffice of the Secretary-General, signed by the \r\ndemocratically elected President of Taiwan, His \r\nExcellency Chen Shui-bian. Unfortunately, the United \r\nNations Charter and the rules of procedure of the \r\nSecurity Council were then contravened. Owing to \r\npoor legal advice, the Office of the Secretary-General \r\nfailed to forward Taiwan’s application for membership \r\nto the Security Council, citing General Assembly \r\nresolution 2758 (XXVI) for its failure. Even though \r\nmany Member States continue to hide behind \r\nresolution 2758 (XXVI), it should be realized that this \r\nresolution does not declare that Taiwan is a part of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, nor does it preclude \r\nTaiwan from future membership of this body. It \r\ncertainly does not support the so-called one China \r\nprinciple. \r\n Ever since the establishment of the People’s \r\nRepublic of China on 1 October 1949, the two sides of \r\nthe Taiwan Strait have been governed separately, with \r\nneither side exercising any control or jurisdiction over \r\nthe other. Let me be absolutely clear: Taiwan has no \r\nintention of representing the People’s Republic of \r\nChina. Taiwan is a free and peace-loving sovereign \r\nState, and its democratically elected Government is the \r\nsole legitimate Government of their island State.  \r\n Apart from the legal and moral rights of Taiwan \r\nto be part of the United Nations, there is another \r\ndimension that needs to be taken into account. Taiwan \r\nis one of the largest economies in the world, including \r\nbeing one of the larger trading partners of other \r\nMembers of the United Nations. It is also one of the \r\ntop twenty sources of world foreign investment and is \r\nwell positioned to assist many of the members of this \r\nbody in their development, which it has already \r\ndemonstrated. Taiwan is a very important investor and \r\ntrading partner for my country and others in my  \r\nregion — even for those that do not recognize it \r\nformally.  \r\n My delegation calls on the Office of the \r\nSecretary-General to uphold the integrity of this pre-\r\neminent Organization and conform to the United \r\nNations Charter and the rules of procedure of the \r\nSecurity Council. It must immediately accept and \r\nsubmit to the Security Council Taiwan’s application for \r\nmembership.  \r\n Peoples of the world look to the United Nations \r\nand to their leaders to identify and act on major global \r\nchallenges that confront the world today. Earlier this \r\nweek, we concluded a High-Level Event on Climate \r\nChange. Our discussions encompassed a variety of \r\nviews and proposals that we all hope will lead to global \r\nresolve to achieve significant changes. Nauru takes the \r\nview that the international community, particularly \r\nthose countries with the capacity that comes with their \r\nstatus as developed nations, has a responsibility to \r\nprovide financial, humanitarian and other assistance to \r\nsmall island developing States that stand to suffer the \r\nmost dire consequences of global climate change.  \r\n Of course, we must acknowledge and express \r\ngratitude for those aid policies that have been proposed \r\nand established, but more is needed to avert a potential \r\ndisaster, especially to the vulnerable small island \r\nnations. Therefore, we ask that ongoing efforts be \r\ncontinued and urge Member States to consider \r\nincreasing their financial support, including easier \r\naccess to the Adaptation Fund. \r\n However, capital investments alone are not \r\nsufficient. Technology, skills and knowledge are \r\nrequired to guide us in our response to the present \r\nchallenge. Furthermore, civil society and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations must cooperate with each \r\nother in acquiring and building the capacity we need to \r\naddress this problem.  \r\n The world situation demands a renewed, \r\nrevitalized and more responsive United Nations now \r\nmore than ever. We need to see the strengthening of \r\nthis multilateral institution through the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly and comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council through intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. All of that must move forward with a \r\ncommon vision for a more coherent United Nations \r\nsystem capable of delivering as one, sparing no efforts \r\nto continue strengthening the three pillars of peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights.  \r\n Nauru is of the view that the comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council will not be complete \r\nwithout Japan, India, Brazil and Germany as permanent \r\nmembers. \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n9 07-51962 \r\n \r\n In closing, I wish to remind this Assembly of the \r\nSecretary-General’s recent observation of the United \r\nNations, whereupon he stated: \r\n“The true measure of success for the United \r\nNations is not how much we promise, but how \r\nmuch we deliver for those who need us most.” \r\n(A/61/PV.31) \r\nAs we move forward our discussions on the many \r\nchallenging and complex issues before us, let us do so \r\nwith the best of intentions, and more importantly, let us \r\nmake good our promise to deliver.  \r\n Finally, while I stand in this great country of the \r\nUnited States of America, the land of the free, I cannot \r\nhelp but remember that its people have put their trust in \r\nGod. On my island country of Nauru, also a land of the \r\nfree, we have placed our belief in God’s will first. \r\nTherefore, to every human being on our planet Earth, I \r\nbeseech each and every one of us to dedicate ourselves \r\nto hold true to our God’s will. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Nauru for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Ludwig Scotty, President of the Republic of \r\nNauru, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, President of \r\nthe Union of the Comoros \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Union of the \r\nComoros. \r\n Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Sambi (spoke in French): Echoing \r\nprevious eminent speakers at this rostrum, on behalf of \r\nmy country, the Union of the Comoros, and on my own \r\nbehalf, it is a genuine pleasure to address our warm \r\ncongratulations to the President on his brilliant \r\nassumption of the presidency of the sixty-second \r\nsession of this Assembly. It is a pleasure likewise to \r\naddress our warmest congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the effective manner in \r\nwhich he has carried out his duties in this world \r\nundergoing vast change, which requires increased \r\ncommitment by our Organization. May I also extend \r\nour sincere thanks to the American Government and to \r\nthe leaders of this magnificent city of New York for the \r\nfine preparations that they have made to receive and \r\nwelcome us here. \r\n The situations of conflict that claim innocent \r\nvictims — in the Middle East, in Darfur, in Somalia \r\nand in so many other regions where hotbeds of tension \r\nerupt — appeal to our collective conscience and call \r\nfor urgent measures for calm and for the resolution of \r\nsuch problems. My Government endorses any action \r\ntaken by the international community, particularly the \r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations, in seeking \r\nsolutions to these problems, which are a source of \r\nconcern for the whole world. \r\n The world has reason to be concerned. Fear and \r\nuncertainty have become widespread, within both \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. Paradoxically, \r\nscience and technology have never been so effective. \r\nThe world has never been so rich, nor has it displayed \r\nsuch great profits.  \r\n Today, the countries of the South are \r\noverwhelmed by the burden of debt, civil war, \r\ninsecurity, destitution, precariousness and endemic \r\ndisease. Therefore, security and harmony in this world \r\ncall for greater solidarity and greater humanism. \r\n The international community should thus \r\nemphasize development assistance to help the small \r\ncountries to meet environmental challenges, \r\nparticularly the effects of climate change, degradation \r\nof the ecosystem and desertification. Such solidarity \r\nshould also be forthcoming in combating other \r\nscourges affecting our countries, most specifically \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and all other diseases that decimate \r\nour peoples and impede our development. \r\n In addition, yet another scourge besets the world, \r\nand that is terrorism, which recognizes no borders. Nor \r\ndoes it recognize race or religion in its unspeakable \r\ncowardice and blindness. We should do everything \r\npossible to ensure that it can no longer flourish on \r\npoverty and prosper on the weakest links of the world \r\nchain.  \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 10 \r\n \r\n Also, we must ensure that fanaticism and \r\nintolerance can no longer impose their law on the \r\nworld and destroy humankind. Indeed, in bolstering \r\ntolerance and respect for the right to difference and for \r\nthe dignity of every people, we will avoid possible \r\nsetbacks, attacks on human rights and the amalgam of \r\nterrorism and particular religions or regions. In this \r\nway, we will be successful in guaranteeing lasting \r\npeace, stability, security and development, because it \r\nwould be an illusion to speak of such ideals in a world \r\nof poverty, where economic development and the  \r\nwell-being of each and every individual have not yet \r\nbeen achieved.  \r\n Moreover, at this midpoint on the way to the \r\ndeadline of 2015 set for the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, while notable progress has been achieved, full \r\nachievement of these objectives depend to a large \r\nextent, on international solidarity and respect for the \r\nvarious commitments entered into by the wealthiest \r\ncountries. \r\n The reform of our Organization is more necessary \r\nthan ever to ensure that it is fully representative and \r\nbetter reflects its universal nature. Thus, Africa and all \r\nother regions of the world should be appropriately \r\nrepresented within the Organization in order to more \r\neffectively embody the principle of equality of States \r\nwithin this great concert of nations. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n Allow me to take this exceptional opportunity to \r\npresent some insight into the situation in my country, \r\nthe Union of the Comoros.  \r\n Since assuming the highest office, I have \r\nendeavoured, with my Government, to give effect to \r\nthe commitments made to the people of the Comoros \r\nand to the international community in connection with \r\nrespect for human rights, the rule of law and good \r\ngovernance, particularly through the restoration of a \r\nsystem of justice that should serve as a model, the \r\nstruggle against corruption, the struggle against \r\ninsalubrious housing and advancing the situation of \r\nwomen. \r\n In this certainly very ambitious endeavour, I rely \r\nlargely on the people of the Comoros themselves to \r\nestablish at the national level the conditions necessary \r\nfor the success of the mission and task I have set \r\nmyself. I am also confident that international solidarity \r\nwill continue to increase, to support to a small country \r\nsuch as ours in confronting the numerous problems that \r\nit encounters daily. Indeed, I would like to express \r\nfrom this rostrum our gratitude to all the countries and \r\norganizations that support us in this undertaking of \r\nbuilding a nation in the Comoros that is peaceful and \r\nprosperous.  \r\n But I have to emphasize that there was a time not \r\nso long ago when the African continent and other \r\nregions of the world were shaken by endless coups \r\nd’état. That illegal, antidemocratic and frequently \r\nviolent form of access to power plunged the countries \r\nin question into instability.  \r\n It would appear that that time is now passed, with \r\nthe advent of democracy and multiparty systems. The \r\nlarge majority of political forces would appear to \r\naccept democratic succession through free and \r\ntransparent consultation of peoples as being the only \r\nacceptable means for acceding to power. \r\n However, another mode of violent political action \r\ncontinues to exist in developing countries and appears \r\nto be assuming particular importance, namely, the \r\narmed rebellions affecting many countries, including \r\nthe Comoros, my country. Armed uprisings are a \r\nsource of destabilization and an obstacle to \r\ndevelopment efforts. Such uprisings are frequently at \r\nthe centre of political and geopolitical interests that \r\nsupport them, to the detriment of the best interests of \r\nthe countries themselves. They benefit from the \r\nexplicit or hidden support of internal or external forces \r\nwhich use them. \r\n My country is not free from this phenomenon. \r\nIndeed, the former Head of the Executive of the island \r\nof Anjouan refuses to hold free and democratic \r\nelections at the end of his term. He is leading an armed \r\nuprising that has attacked the presidency of the Union, \r\nthe representation of the Government of the Union in \r\nthe island and the contingent of the National \r\nDevelopment Army. The uprising jeopardizes the hopes \r\nfor development of the country by causing delays in \r\nrepayment of the debt of the Comoros to the \r\ninternational institutions and hampers the resumption \r\nof investment from abroad. It is for this reason that I \r\nstate here our major concern at the political crisis that \r\nwe are experiencing. \r\n Therefore, I make a solemn and urgent appeal to \r\nthe entire international community to assist us in \r\nestablishing lasting stability in the Union of the \r\nComoros by settling the problem of the uprising that \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n11 07-51962 \r\n \r\ncontinues in the autonomous island of Anjouan. \r\nIndeed, all the steps taken by the Government of the \r\nUnion have encountered to date the intransigence of \r\nthe rebels of Anjouan, who refuse to comply with the \r\nresolutions of the African Union and the \r\nrecommendations of the international community \r\nregarding the organization of free and democratic \r\nelections in Anjouan, as occurred in the other two \r\nislands and in respect of the constitutional legality, \r\nparticularly, the exercise in Anjouan of legitimate \r\npowers. \r\n From the bottom of my heart, I would wish to \r\nthank all our bilateral and multilateral partners for their \r\nunflagging support in the search for a prompt and final \r\nsolution to the crisis that we are experiencing. For all \r\nthese partners, I have always demonstrated our \r\ngoodwill in seeking to settle the Anjouan crisis by \r\npeaceful means because the important thing is to save \r\nnational unity and preserve the people of the Comoros \r\nfrom anything that might damage our development \r\nefforts. \r\n I take this opportunity also to thank the \r\nauthorities of the African Development Bank and all \r\nthose instrumental in providing partial debt relief to the \r\nComoros, with a view to facilitating our economic \r\nrecovery. \r\n The Assembly will understand that the Comorian \r\nGovernment cannot sanction any action that would \r\nestablish the Balkanization of our country. The \r\nComorian people remember only too well the \r\nunfortunate experience regarding the sister island of \r\nMayotte. Although the one case is a problem within the \r\nComoros and the other a dispute with France, which is \r\na friendly country and principal partner of the  \r\nComoros — and I stress that fact, France is a friendly \r\ncountry, a friend and principal partner of the  \r\nComoros — both situations involve the disunion of our \r\ncountry, and we cannot remain indifferent to them. \r\n Over 30 years have passed since the independent \r\nnation of the Comoros was admitted to the United \r\nNations, within its authentic borders, that is, comprised \r\nof four islands: Ngazidja, Mwali, Ndzouani and Maoré. \r\nDuring those 30 years, all organizations that have \r\nrecognized our independence have unflaggingly \r\nsupported the just claim by the Comoros of sovereignty \r\nover the island of Mayotte, a claim upheld by the \r\nsuccessive Governments in Moroni. That is a principle \r\nthat the people of the Comoros will never give up, even \r\nif the approach has varied from one administration to \r\nthe next. Today, my Government would like, in a calm \r\natmosphere, to deal with this matter with France, \r\ngiving priority to dialogue and consultation. For we \r\nmust together find a rapid response to the problem of \r\nthe human tragedies caused by the frequent shipwrecks \r\nof makeshift boats transporting on virtually a weekly \r\nbasis dozens of Comorians from the other islands who \r\nvisit Mayotte to meet with their families. We must \r\npromptly together deal with the inhuman treatment \r\ninflicted on Comorians from the other islands residing \r\nin Mayotte, and we must seek to facilitate the free \r\nmovement of goods and persons among all the islands \r\nof the archipelago. Lastly, we must find together a \r\nmodus vivendi that reflects particularly the social, \r\ncultural, linguistic, economic, religious and historical \r\nrealities that shape the life of all Comorians.  \r\n To that end, I am happy to note the convergence \r\nof views with Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the \r\nFrench Republic, who, during his address to this \r\nAssembly stated, \r\n “I want to say, in the name of France, that there \r\nwill be no peace in the world without respect for \r\ndiversity, without respect for national identities, \r\nwithout respect, I venture to say, for religions and \r\nbeliefs, or without respect for cultures. \r\nAttachment to one’s faith, to one’s identity, to \r\none’s language and culture, and to one’s way of \r\nlife, thought and belief — all that is legitimate, \r\nand profoundly human”. (A/62/PV.4) \r\n I thus appeal to the United Nations to take on this \r\nmatter by working to achieve a closer rapprochement \r\nbetween the two parties, with a view to a prompt \r\nsettlement of the question. I truly believe that together \r\nwith the French authorities we can find the ways and \r\nmeans to move towards a final, just and lawful solution \r\nto this problem.  \r\n In the ongoing quest for peace and freedom, I \r\nhave a particular thought for those who, throughout the \r\nworld, are engaged in struggle and are claiming their \r\nrights to unity and territorial integrity. Thus, from this \r\nrostrum, I would like to renew to our friend the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, our commitment to a \r\npolicy of a single China, single and indivisible. To our \r\nbrother country the Kingdom of Morocco, I would like \r\nto reaffirm our support for its legitimate fight to \r\nrecover its territorial integrity.  \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 12 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, I hope that peace reigns in our \r\nworld, that goodness and good faith win our hearts so \r\nthat the people of the world can live in happiness and \r\nin greater solidarity than ever.  \r\n I would like to finish with a few words in Arabic. \r\n (spoke in Arabic) \r\n The Israeli-Arab conflict is the source of tensions \r\nin the Middle East, and the Palestinians in the occupied \r\nArab territories live in inhuman and tragic economic \r\nconditions because of Israeli practices. The \r\ninternational community must deal decisively with this \r\nsituation by requiring the Israeli authorities to \r\nimplement relevant Security Council and General \r\nAssembly resolutions and decisions. Additionally, the \r\nprovisions of international law, international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights must be observed. \r\nAs we all know, there can be no peace in the Middle \r\nEast without a just and lasting solution to the \r\nPalestinian question effected by the withdrawal of \r\nIsrael from the Arab territories that it occupied in 1967.  \r\n Without the establishment of a viable Palestinian \r\nState, with East Jerusalem with its capital, and the \r\nsettlement of the question of refugees on the basis of \r\nthe General Assembly resolution of 1949, the conflict \r\nwill not be settled. Construction of settlements must be \r\nstopped, the separation wall must be demolished and \r\nPalestinians must be compensated for damage caused \r\nby its construction. I also invite our Palestinian \r\nbrothers to renounce division and disintegration and to \r\nengage in dialogue. The international community and \r\nthe United Nations must provide swift humanitarian \r\nassistance to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, open \r\nthe crossings and dismantle anything that hampers \r\nmovement. \r\n We also state our solidarity with our brothers in \r\nLebanon, and we call for full implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), the cessation \r\nof Israeli incursions into Lebanon and withdrawal from \r\nthe Sheba’a Farms.  \r\n On the subject of Darfur, we give priority to the \r\npeace talks to be held in Libya on 24 October this year. \r\nWe hope that all the parties will attend these talks. The \r\ninternational community must assume its responsibility \r\nand urge the parties to participate in those negotiations, \r\nwhich we hope will be final and decisive. We also hope \r\nthat the African Union mission and character in Darfur \r\nwill be respected and that the sovereignty, unity and \r\nterritorial integrity of the Sudan will be fully respected.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Union of the Comoros for the statement he has just \r\nmade.  \r\n Mr. Sambi, President of the Union of the \r\nComoros, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n Address by Mr. Janez Janša, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Slovenia \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia.  \r\n Mr. Janez Janša, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Janez Janša, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Slovenia, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Janša (Slovenia) (spoke in Slovenian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Mr. President, \r\nlet me first express my gratitude to your predecessor, \r\nHer Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for \r\nher leadership of the General Assembly. To you, Sir, on \r\nbehalf of Slovenia, I assure full support for your \r\nleadership. We also look forward to cooperating with \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \r\n An important part of the sixty-second session of \r\nthe General Assembly will coincide with a period of \r\nincreased international responsibility for Slovenia. We \r\nwill do our best to make good use of this opportunity \r\nand to benefit not only Europe, but the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. The United Nations will be at \r\nthe heart of our efforts. This Organization still \r\nrepresents humankind in its best light. \r\n The discussions this week have proved that the \r\nglobal community has identified the challenges brought \r\nabout by the human impact on the environment. The \r\nwill to find solutions under United Nations auspices \r\nwas clearly expressed. The sheer dimension and \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n13 07-51962 \r\n \r\ncomplexity of the issue require that this Organization \r\nhave primacy. \r\n Today, environmental changes are occurring all \r\nover the world. Slovenia pins great hopes on a regional \r\napproach in the search for solutions. At the global \r\nlevel, we support the principle of common, but \r\ndifferent, responsibilities. A common approach is \r\nnecessary because of the considerable impact of \r\nclimate change, including on global security and \r\nstability. \r\n Country-specific solutions should allow space for \r\nrealizing development potential. Slovenia is very \r\nserious about its commitments within the European \r\nframework. The European Union has showed the will \r\nand ability to take initiative. We hope that such \r\nexamples will set the dominant tone of the overall \r\ndiscussion through the new framework for the period \r\nafter 2012. \r\n Slovenia welcomes the progress made so far in \r\nthe United Nations reform process and will continue to \r\nwork towards the more responsive, effective and \r\nrepresentative United Nations. \r\n The role of the United Nations in maintaining \r\npeace and security is indispensable. This year, more \r\nthan 10 per cent of the members of the Slovenian \r\narmed forces participated in missions abroad under the \r\nmandate of the Security Council. The majority of them \r\nhelped to strengthen peace and stability in South-\r\nEastern Europe, and also in Afghanistan, Lebanon and \r\nIraq. \r\n In the last decade and a half, the international \r\ncommunity has dedicated considerable human and \r\nfinancial resources to the region of the Balkans. The \r\ncontribution is great; therefore the dividends of peace \r\nfor the whole region should not be wasted at the end of \r\nthe stabilization process. We need to pursue solutions \r\nto secure these dividends; then they should be further \r\ninvested in the common European project. \r\n The international community must, within the \r\nframework of the United Nations, complete the \r\nestablishment of mechanisms aimed at meeting the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Finalizing a \r\ncomprehensive United Nations convention on \r\ninternational terrorism must continue to be a key \r\npriority. Another challenge remains concrete \r\napplication of the concept of the responsibility to \r\nprotect. \r\n Even the most determined efforts to achieve \r\nglobal security have little chance for lasting success \r\nunder conditions of inequality. Therefore, achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) is of \r\nparamount importance. Creating equal opportunities \r\nfor the disadvantaged and demonstrating solidarity \r\nwith them are sustainable investments in peace. It is \r\nonly when both developed and developing countries \r\nchoose to make such investments that the benefits of \r\nthe world’s current economic growth will be more \r\nfairly distributed. \r\n Slovenia was very pleased to become a member \r\nof the Human Rights Council. The trust that has been \r\nplaced in us will be honoured through our active and \r\nopen efforts to achieve the implementation of human \r\nrights standards. We will continue to support the policy \r\nof global abolition of the death penalty. \r\n Slovenia attaches great importance to the concept \r\nof human security, which is in accordance with the \r\npillars of the United Nations: development, security \r\nand human rights. We accord special attention to \r\nchildren: the youngest victims of violence, poverty and \r\ndeadly pandemics are also the most powerless. \r\nTherefore, it remains true that a man never stands so \r\ntall as when he kneels to help a child. \r\n In that respect, Slovenia takes particular pride in \r\nits full cooperation with the non-governmental sector. \r\nThe Together Foundation, which is concerned with the \r\npsychosocial well-being of children in societies \r\naffected by armed conflict, and the Slovenian \r\nInternational Trust Fund for Demining and Mine \r\nVictims Assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina were \r\nfounded as a result of Slovenia’s initiatives aimed at \r\nthe wider region. \r\n Slovenia actively participates in initiatives on \r\nintercultural dialogue, devoting special attention to the \r\nMediterranean area. We hope to see the early \r\nestablishment of a Euro-Mediterranean university, \r\nwhich would be a Slovenian contribution to raising \r\nawareness about the need for peaceful coexistence \r\namong those with different cultures and world views. \r\n Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the chief \r\narchitects of the United Nations, predicted at the time \r\nof the establishment of the Organization that change \r\nwould be a regular feature of its development. Indeed, \r\nthe United Nations continues to be built today. The \r\ngreat hopes of humanity depend on our joint efforts, \r\nwhich will never be completed. Therefore, it is my \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 14 \r\n \r\nhope that the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly will be crowned with success.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Janez Janša, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief \r\nAdviser of the Caretaker Government of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Chief Adviser of the Caretaker \r\nGovernment of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. \r\n Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief Adviser of the \r\nCaretaker Government of the People’s Republic \r\nof Bangladesh, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, \r\nChief Adviser of the Caretaker Government of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Ahmed (Bangladesh): I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to express to you, Mr. President, my \r\ndelegation’s sincerest congratulations on your well-\r\ndeserved election. A special tribute goes to Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa and to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for their visionary \r\nand dedicated leadership. \r\n Recent events in Bangladesh have aroused \r\nconsiderable interest worldwide as we struggle to fulfil \r\nthe promise of democracy for our people. I will take \r\nthis opportunity to share with the global community \r\nsome of our recent experiences in consolidating \r\ndemocracy. We have learned that democracy is not an \r\nevent; it is an ongoing process. It is not just about \r\ncasting votes and changing Governments; it is also \r\nabout social justice, accountability and empowerment \r\nof the people. \r\n Those who have followed events in Bangladesh \r\nover the past few months will know that the Caretaker \r\nGovernment came into office in January this year amid \r\na political stalemate. The fabric of our democracy had \r\nbeen torn apart by years of catastrophic corruption. \r\nWidespread frustration with the status quo had led to a \r\nrising tide of political violence. That in turn had \r\ndisrupted ordinary life and shattered all public \r\nconfidence in the possibility of credible elections. \r\nMoreover, there was little hope that a tainted election \r\ncould end the cycle of violence. A state of emergency \r\nwas therefore declared on 11 January of this year in an \r\neffort to end the ongoing chaos and to usher in a new \r\nbeginning. \r\n As stipulated in our constitution, the non-party \r\nCaretaker Government acts as a bridge between two \r\nsuccessive political Governments. Our task is, first and \r\nforemost, to ensure a free and fair election, and we are \r\nfully committed to fulfilling that responsibility. \r\nHowever, our nation has learned through harsh \r\nexperience that an election cannot simply be a one-off \r\ncasting of votes, but must be part of a dynamic and \r\ncontinuing process whereby people freely choose their \r\nleaders.  \r\n While Bangladesh has held three elections in the \r\npast two decades, our democracy has been brutally \r\nundermined by ruinous corruption. The lack of \r\nsystemic institutional safeguards allowed corruption to \r\nrun rampant. That created a winner-takes-all electoral \r\nsystem, whereby the spoils of electoral victory were so \r\ngreat, and the stakes of winning so high, that the \r\npolitical process became hopelessly polarized, leading \r\nto a paralysis even of ordinary governance. As the \r\nbenefits of winning elections increased, so did the \r\ncosts of securing victory, creating a truly vicious circle \r\nin which corruption became the linchpin. Corruption \r\nthus became both the means and the end in terms of \r\nwinning elections. If our democratic spirit is to emerge \r\nunscathed from that downward spiral, and if we are to \r\ndeliver free, fair and meaningful elections, we must \r\nfirst free our politics from the clutches of corruption \r\nand violence. \r\n Democracy and the rule of law are not merely \r\nconcepts; they must be embodied in functioning public \r\ninstitutions. In Bangladesh, the very institutions that \r\nform the foundations of democracy have been eroded \r\nby ongoing corruption. Rebuilding those institutions \r\nand restoring public confidence through meaningful \r\nreforms are Herculean tasks, but they are ones in which \r\nwe cannot and will not fail. \r\n In Bangladesh, the task of conducting free and \r\nfair elections is the responsibility of the Election \r\nCommission. The Caretaker Government has already \r\noverhauled the Commission, guaranteeing its \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n15 07-51962 \r\n \r\nindependence and giving it a broader mandate. The \r\nElection Commission, of its own accord, has \r\nannounced a timeline for the holding of the next \r\nparliamentary election by the end of 2008. Our \r\nAdministration is committed to ensuring that that \r\ntimeframe is adhered to. We will bring to bear the full \r\nresources of the Government in that effort. \r\n Our Government has reorganized the Independent \r\nAnti-Corruption Commission to ensure that it can \r\neffectively lead the fight against corruption. We have \r\ngiven the Commission broad and sweeping powers — \r\nincluding operational independence — not only to \r\napprehend those who have been corrupt, but also to \r\nwork as a deterrent. Within a month after coming into \r\noffice, our Government acceded to the United Nations \r\nConvention against Corruption as a clear signal of our \r\nunwavering commitment against corruption.  \r\n The implementation of the Convention will not \r\nonly contribute to the reduction of corruption in \r\nBangladesh, but will also help us to recover the \r\nill-gotten gains of corruption stored abroad. Those who \r\nengage in corruption must confront the reality that \r\nthere is no safe haven for them. The world is united in \r\nthe struggle against corruption, and today Bangladesh \r\npledges itself an active partner in that endeavour. \r\n One of the most critical elements of a functioning \r\ndemocracy is an independent judiciary. In Bangladesh, \r\nthe lower judiciary and criminal prosecution were \r\ntraditionally under the executive branch of the \r\nGovernment, contrary to the constitutional principle of \r\nseparation of powers. While judicial independence has \r\nbeen part of the political manifesto of successive \r\ngovernments over the past 15 years, each has \r\nrepeatedly reneged on its public promises in this \r\nregard. Recognizing the importance of an independent \r\njudiciary to the rule of law, the Caretaker Government \r\nwithin its first month in office initiated the necessary \r\nsteps to fully separate the executive and judicial \r\nbranches of the Government. We have also revamped \r\nthe Bangladesh Public Service Commission and the \r\nUniversity Grants Commission in order to restore the \r\napolitical nature of those important institutions. \r\n Political parties are among the core constituents \r\nof democracy. Their accountability and true democratic \r\ncharacter remain critically important for democracy to \r\nfunction. In response to demands of the people, the \r\nmain political parties have themselves initiated various \r\nreforms, and the revamped parties will interact with the \r\nrevitalized institutions of the Government to move our \r\nnation forward.  \r\n Bangladesh reaffirms its unflinching commitment \r\nto universal and inalienable human rights. Any society \r\ncommitted to democracy requires the recognition and \r\nenforcement of human rights, and in Bangladesh the \r\nfight against corruption and the strengthening of the \r\nrule of law go hand-in-hand with the protection of \r\nhuman rights. The Caretaker Government has, \r\ntherefore, taken the decision to establish a national \r\nhuman rights commission to ensure that our laws and \r\npublic institutions reflect international standards and \r\nnorms of human rights. It is unfortunate that successive \r\nGovernments have shied away from taking this \r\nimportant step.  \r\n Bangladesh remains resolute in its relentless \r\ncampaign against international extremism and \r\nterrorism. We recently acceded to the International \r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear \r\nTerrorism. Bangladesh is now a party to all terrorism-\r\nrelated United Nations conventions, a testament to our \r\ncommitment to fighting terrorism in all its forms. On \r\nthe domestic front, we have taken stern measures \r\nagainst militant groups and their patrons. In particular, \r\nwe categorically reject the claims of those who cloak \r\nthemselves in the rhetoric of Islam to justify terrorism. \r\nBangladesh is steadfast in its commitment to curb \r\nreligious fundamentalism in all its manifestations.  \r\n Our experience in re-instilling confidence in the \r\nGovernment has a wider relevance to the international \r\ncommunity. The problems that we are facing today are \r\nnot unique to Bangladesh. After all, in the developing \r\nworld democracy does not necessarily ensure good \r\ngovernance. Many countries face similar problems of \r\npolitical violence, mis-governance and corruption. This \r\nis particularly true for post-conflict and transition \r\nsocieties, where the politics of mistrust is pervasive. \r\nWe feel that a greater understanding of our challenges \r\nand, more importantly, of our efforts to re-build \r\npolitical and social institutions, can serve as \r\nbenchmarks for others facing similar situations. For \r\nexample, Bangladesh represents an effective model of \r\ncivil-military cooperation in crisis prevention. Our \r\nexperience in crisis management could be relevant for \r\nmany crisis-torn, nascent democracies.  \r\n One way in which we can share our experiences \r\nin governance is through our robust presence in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. We have consistently \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 16 \r\n \r\nbeen one of the top troop-contributing countries in the \r\nworld, and our peacekeepers have earned accolades for \r\ntheir contributions. We are confident that Bangladesh \r\nwill continue to play a leadership role in multi-\r\ndimensional peacekeeping efforts, and we are ready to \r\nprovide comprehensive deployment packages in future \r\npeace operations. We also remain active in the United \r\nNations peacebuilding endeavours in post-conflict \r\nsocieties.  \r\n We warmly welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\ntimely initiative to restructure the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations. The world is witnessing a \r\nnatural evolution from the monitoring of peace to \r\nmultidimensional tasks of peacebuilding, \r\ndemocratization and development. As one of the largest \r\ntroop-contributing countries (TCCs), we strongly feel \r\nthat the TCCs should have equitable representation and \r\nplay a greater role in deployment and other strategic \r\ndecisions.  \r\n The United Nations is in the midst of a \r\ncontinuing evolution. It is our collective responsibility \r\nto make the United Nations more relevant to the \r\npresent day world, to fulfil the promise Dag \r\nHammarskjöld spoke of when he said, “The day will \r\ncome when men will see the United Nations and what \r\nit means clearly.” The Secretary-General’s report on \r\nsystem-wide coherence presents several useful \r\nrecommendations in this connection. However, we feel \r\nthat the reform exercise should focus on the \r\nrequirements of achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and we recognize that the \r\nspeed of reform must be gradual.  \r\n We must reflect upon what is needed by the \r\nUnited Nations, in terms of financial and human \r\nresources, to foster development. Keeping in mind that \r\ndeveloping countries differ greatly in their political, \r\nadministrative and social structures, the reform \r\nexercise must take this diversity into account and allow \r\nindividual countries to determine the structure of the \r\nUnited Nations presence at the country level, the \r\nrepresentation of different United Nations agencies and \r\ntheir country programmes. We must not undermine the \r\nidentities of individual United Nations agencies, \r\nincluding their mandates, independence and \r\ninstitutional integrity.  \r\n Earlier this week, we discussed the exceedingly \r\nimportant issue of climate change. World leaders \r\nreaffirmed our shared commitment to address the issue \r\nof global warming. Bangladesh is particularly \r\nvulnerable to global warming, given that as much as 30 \r\nper cent of our land will be submerged if the Bay of \r\nBengal rises by just one metre. The adverse effects of \r\nglobal warming, deforestation and increased salinity \r\nare already evident in Bangladesh. Floods have become \r\nan annual calamity, and this year our people have \r\nsuffered particularly severe losses owing to flooding. \r\nWhile the resilience of our people and the quick \r\nmobilization of our limited domestic resources helped \r\nus to overcome the crisis this year, we envisage that \r\nthis may become harder in the future. We therefore \r\nurge enhanced international cooperation to meet the \r\nchallenges of global warming and its consequences.  \r\n There is a growing acknowledgment that trade \r\nliberalization can be an effective tool for economic \r\ndevelopment. For the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs), the trade-to-gross domestic product ratio \r\naverages about 58 per cent, while it is roughly 25 per \r\ncent for many Organization for Economic Cooperation \r\nand Development countries. These statistics show that \r\nthe LDCs are far more dependent on trade than their \r\ndeveloped counterparts. Bangladesh, along with many \r\nother LDCs, is facing significant tariff and non-tariff \r\nbarriers in accessing developed markets. Global trade \r\nregimes must provide unimpeded access to all products \r\nof LDCs, so as to ensure that the fruits of progress are \r\nshared by all.  \r\n While representing a nation of 140 million \r\npeople, squeezed into an area roughly the size of New \r\nYork State, I must underscore the importance of \r\nmigration to our development efforts. For many in \r\nBangladesh and other developing countries, temporary \r\nlabour migration provides a livelihood option and a \r\nroute out of poverty. If we are to reduce poverty by \r\nhalf by 2015, we must strengthen our efforts to ensure \r\nthe free movement of labour. The international \r\ncommunity is recognizing the critical linkages between \r\nmigration and development. It is encouraging that the \r\nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development, held in \r\nBrussels this July, accorded migration its due priority. \r\nWe must also intensify our efforts to defend the rights \r\nof migrant workers. We would also like to see \r\nmomentum in the liberalization of Mode IV services. \r\nWe call for renewed international efforts — at the \r\nWorld Trade Organization and in other forums — to \r\nfacilitate the free movement of labour services.  \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating my Government’s \r\nunswerving commitment to democracy and the \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n17 07-51962 \r\n \r\nprotection of human rights. We have pledged to put \r\nBangladesh on a higher trajectory of good governance, \r\nrule of law and development. We are determined to \r\nhold a free, fair and meaningful election within the \r\ntimeframe stipulated by our independent Election \r\nCommission and to keep our country firmly on the path \r\nof democracy. My Government is fully committed to \r\nensuring that our reform initiatives are comprehensive \r\nand irreversible. Bangladeshis now stand united for a \r\nprosperous future for their country and the world. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chief Advisor of the \r\nCaretaker Government of the People’s Republic of \r\nBangladesh for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief Advisor of the \r\nCaretaker Government of the People’s Republic \r\nof Bangladesh, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Albert Pintat, Prime Minister \r\nof the Principality of Andorra \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra.  \r\n Mr. Albert Pintat, Prime Minister of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Albert \r\nPintat, Prime Minister of the Principality of Andorra, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Pintat (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan: English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): People and planet. \r\nThey are our alpha and our omega. They are the \r\nfoundation and objective of actions by bodies such as \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n The Earth is blue like an orange, said the poet \r\nPaul Eluard. That is a logical statement, as our planet \r\ntakes its blue colour from the sky and the oceans that \r\nprotect us, and the orange colour from the fruit that \r\nnourishes us. The Earth is a sphere that moves and \r\nturns with infinite interdependence. The human \r\nattitude, nature and peoples are bound together to form \r\na single scheme of debate, impossible to resolve \r\nseparately. \r\n Every year in the General Assembly we are \r\npleased to feel that our work is centred on the ideals of \r\na better world in the environment of a democratic \r\nstructure, dialogue, the brotherhood of cultures and \r\nfinancial and social interchange, supportive and \r\nprosperous between peoples. \r\n The latest data available to us on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) show a positive trend. We \r\nhave made great progress in the reduction of child \r\nmortality and we have applied various measures of \r\ntruly surprising simplicity that have demonstrated their \r\neffectiveness in eradicating many illnesses. And yet the \r\ninhabitants of the world — the people, flora and fauna \r\nof the planet — look at our organizations and all of us \r\nsomewhat suspiciously. There is much concern. There \r\nis great uncertainty. \r\n With your permission, my words today will not \r\nbe of self-complacency — either for the results \r\nobtained or for the undeniable improvement in some of \r\nthe ailments that undermine our dignity as people. \r\nCongratulations can give way to relaxation and can \r\nhave a perversely soothing effect on our consciences. \r\nThe development of global societies has become \r\nessential in the light of the positions affecting \r\neconomic, social, cultural, military and political \r\nsystems on a worldwide scale. There is an urgent need \r\nfor conceptualization in the face of the evident poverty \r\nresulting from the sudden and profound \r\ntransformations suffered by peoples, regions and \r\ncountries. Successive waves of contributions of capital \r\nand human resources combine with pre-existing human \r\nsubstrata, creating superimposed layers that further \r\naccentuate differences. When those investments cease \r\nto be profitable, resources are redirected. That results \r\nin situations of change or crisis. \r\n The realities on which we have to concentrate are \r\nthose of a world in which, according to the latest data \r\npublished by UNICEF, 9.7 million children’s lives \r\nwere lost in one year; a world in which human life \r\nexpectancy can differ by more than 30 years; a world \r\nin which more than 39 million people are infected with \r\nthe AIDS virus; and a world in which too many people \r\nare still without access to safe drinking water. That is \r\nnot doomsaying on my part; it is a recognition that the \r\nadvances made cannot conceal the profound \r\nshortcomings that still exist or hold back the \r\nachievement of results. \r\n Indignation and rejection in the face of every \r\nunacceptable reality have made possible the finest \r\nachievements for the progress of humanity in a \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 18 \r\n \r\nremarkable way at the United Nations and must now \r\nenable us to obtain more resources, to go faster, to have \r\nmore ideas and to be even more effective. \r\n Mr. Beck (Palau), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n For more than six decades, the United Nations \r\nhas sought to be the moral and legal force which \r\nensures that dialogue, cooperation and solidarity take \r\nthe place of oppression, weapons, famine, ignorance, \r\nmisery and injustice. However, during the years of \r\nexistence of the United Nations, wars, poverty and \r\nintolerance have not stopped. On the contrary, we have \r\nhad to add new ills, such as the radicalization of \r\nfundamentalism or the degradation of the environment, \r\nand increasingly frequent natural disasters. \r\nEarthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, tornadoes \r\nand floods and the thawing of many of the glaciers at \r\nthe two poles are vivid examples of the climatic \r\ndisorder that we have to combat. To tell the truth, the \r\nplanet is threatened; but I do not think that this is an \r\naccurate assertion. Those really threatened are the most \r\nvulnerable persons and countries. They are the ones \r\nwho suffer from war, illness and underdevelopment. \r\nClimate change will affect all of us, but not all of us \r\nequally. \r\n At the same time, trafficking in, and the abuse of, \r\nchildren and women continue despite the legal \r\ninstruments with which we have equipped countries \r\nsuch as Andorra, where the defence of human rights \r\nand liberties is considered to be a fundamental \r\ninspiring principle. \r\n The world of the twenty-first century views \r\narmed conflicts, terrorism, violations of human rights \r\nand extremely precarious situations in many areas with \r\nsomething between resignation and impotence. I would \r\nrefer, merely as an example, to the extreme situation \r\nthat has affected the population of Darfur for many \r\nyears.  \r\n We should not be surprised that, faced with all \r\nthose hard realities, international institutions like ours \r\nare suffering serious crises of discredit and significant \r\nerosion. Nevertheless, if we are here today it is because \r\nwe believe that we can improve the world — people \r\nand planet — because we are convinced that together \r\nwe are able to react. Hope remains intact. Every \r\ncountry — whatever its size — and every director and \r\nevery organization with the capacity for action has to \r\nfight to make law into the essence of vitality and to \r\nachieve open and sincere dialogue in the international \r\narena. As Charles de Gaulle said, it takes several to \r\ndeliberate, and one to act. As Al Gore told us on \r\nMonday, the world requires a global Marshall Plan, \r\nbecause our planet is in an emergency situation. \r\n We are delighted with the thrust and  \r\ndynamism displayed by the new Secretary-General,  \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, since he took office. We praise the \r\nefforts of the General Assembly in setting up a \r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform, as well as \r\nthe proposals that are being studied. We fully support \r\nthe model of society proposed by the United Nations \r\n— rooted in the principles of peace, solidarity, liberty, \r\ncooperation, social development and economic growth. \r\n With regard to goals, I applaud the initiative of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. At the time of \r\ntheir introduction, the previous Secretary-General \r\nwarned us that we needed to break with routine. He \r\ntold us that we could not achieve results in a day \r\nbecause success would require sustained action over \r\nthe 10 years envisaged for implementation. Today, \r\nbefore the entire Assembly, I add my full support to \r\nthose words. I call upon everyone to maintain the pace \r\nand to press the foot down a little harder on the \r\naccelerator. \r\n We all benefit from the progress that we have \r\nmade. We know the enduring relationship that exists \r\nbetween poverty and nearly all the challenges we face: \r\nmortality rates, differences in life expectancy, ill \r\nhealth, injustice, intolerance, marginalization and \r\narmed conflict. Let us reject before the world and \r\nbefore all peoples some of the pernicious prejudices \r\nthat prevent us from advancing. Permit me to recall \r\nthree truths that have been defined a number of times \r\nby Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Earth Institute at \r\nColumbia University. \r\n The first is that the illnesses ravaging poor \r\ncountries are perfectly avoidable and can be prevented. \r\nThe second is that to avoid all the thoroughly \r\nunnecessary deaths caused by them will not affect the \r\npopulation explosion. The third is that poor countries, \r\nas has already been shown and in refutation of some \r\nvoices deliberately ignorant of their prejudices, are \r\ncapable of installing efficient public health \r\nprogrammes when they receive adequate aid. \r\n As a result of the terror and the material and \r\nmoral misery suffered during the Second World War, \r\ncountries, peoples and their representatives came to an \r\nagreement, saying “enough” and creating organizations \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n19 07-51962 \r\n \r\nsuch as the United Nations to regulate and mediate \r\nconflict. They did this with a sense of generosity, a \r\nbreadth of purpose and a boldness that today must \r\ninspire our action even more. \r\n The ideals of the fathers of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations were founded on a respect for \r\nindividuals, on liberty and on access to knowledge and \r\neducation to achieve welfare and peace around the \r\nworld. Only through an energetic renewal of those \r\nideals can we ensure that the balance on planet Earth \r\nimproves perceptibly and continues to do so year by \r\nyear. Only with the unity, understanding and \r\ncooperation of all nations can we obtain results. \r\n The small size of Andorra has not prevented us \r\nfrom maintaining good neighbourly relationships with \r\nFrance and Spain for more than seven centuries. We are \r\nfully concerned and involved with the objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations. With our long and, at the same time, \r\nhumble experience, we could even become a neutral \r\narea, impartial and isolated from partisan interests, in \r\nthe case of any conflict in need of resolution. \r\n We must be realistic, but this must not stop us. \r\nWe must advance with modest but continuous reforms, \r\ntangible and firm reforms that lead us to a better future. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Albert Pintat, Prime Minister of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by General Surayud Chulanont, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Thailand. \r\n General Surayud Chulanont, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Thailand, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming General Surayud Chulanont, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n General Chulanont (Thailand): On behalf of the \r\nRoyal Thai Government, allow me first to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, and the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia on your election as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. The Thai \r\ndelegation looks forward to rendering its full support \r\nfor the work of this session in the coming months. \r\n I also wish to take this opportunity to express my \r\nsincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his tireless devotion to the United Nations and its \r\nreform. The first year in office is crucial for setting the \r\npriorities and future direction of this Organization, and \r\nthe Secretary-General is certainly faced with a great \r\nchallenge. \r\n Thailand is keen to work with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral towards a renewed United Nations — one that \r\nis more responsive and empowered to address \r\neffectively the needs of the peoples of our world. We \r\nare keen to do so because we are committed to what \r\nthe United Nations stands for: respect for equality, for \r\ndiversity, for human rights and for people. \r\n That commitment drives us to build a stronger \r\ndemocracy that is more transparent and has stronger \r\nsafeguards for our people. That commitment also \r\nguides us in building a sound, open economy and a \r\nmore just and equitable society governed by the rule of \r\nlaw — crucial underpinnings for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n All of that is taking place during a very special \r\nyear for the Thai people, namely, the eightieth birthday \r\nof His Majesty the King of Thailand. \r\n As most representatives probably know, exactly \r\none year has passed since Thailand moved to address \r\nthe unprecedented political paralysis in our democratic \r\nsystem. I wish to take this opportunity to assure our \r\nfriends that we are keeping to the timeline for the \r\nrevitalization of parliamentary democracy, with general \r\nelections scheduled for 23 December 2007. \r\n Exactly 10 years ago, Thailand suffered from a \r\ndeep crisis of a different nature. Through globalization, \r\nthat economic ailment quickly spread to many \r\ncountries and regions. Yet we have emerged from the \r\n1997 Asian financial crisis a stronger and more vibrant \r\nfree-market economy. Now, despite high oil prices and \r\nother challenges, Thailand’s economic fundamentals \r\nare strong. \r\n But, while continued economic growth over the \r\npast decade has lifted millions of Thais out of poverty, \r\nsome 10 per cent have not benefited. Thailand, like \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 20 \r\n \r\nother developing countries, continues to face \r\nchallenges to sustainable development in the form of \r\nincome disparities and an urban/rural divide. \r\n I believe that governments have a moral \r\nresponsibility to address disparities in income \r\ndistribution. This is why Thailand has made it our \r\nnational priority to promote growth with equity and to \r\nachieve development from within. Our approach has \r\nbeen based on His Majesty the King’s philosophy of a \r\n“sufficiency economy”, which calls for moderation and \r\nmindfulness in consumption, prudent economic \r\ndecision-making and careful risk management. The \r\nphilosophy’s recognition by the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme in its 2007 Thailand Human \r\nDevelopment Report has strengthened our conviction \r\nthat we are on the right track. \r\n The Government is leading that effort through \r\nuniversal education and investing in basic \r\ninfrastructure for people-centred development. We \r\nbelieve that emphasis on moderation and knowledge \r\nwill lead to a more equitable society, which is \r\nfundamental to sustainable development and immunity \r\nfrom external shocks. \r\n In addition to promoting growth with equity, \r\ngovernments must also ensure that progress does not \r\ncome at the expense of the environment. For Thailand, \r\nthe sufficiency economy’s concepts of moderation and \r\nmindfulness relate directly to the sustainable utilization \r\nof natural resources. Thailand aims at cutting back on \r\nits reliance on fossil fuels and at lowering greenhouse \r\ngas emissions through energy conservation. \r\n At the same time, we seek to meet our growing \r\nenergy demand through renewable energy and biofuels. \r\nWe are also considering the option of nuclear energy, \r\npaying heed to the crucial issue of safety. \r\n But Thailand realizes that a significant reduction \r\nof fossil fuel use will likely take a few more decades, \r\nowing to the high costs of new technology. There must \r\nbe greater partnership between countries that have \r\ndeveloped clean energy technologies and those who \r\nlack them. We therefore reiterate our call for research \r\nand development cooperation and the affordable \r\ntransfer of clean coal and methane reduction \r\ntechnologies. \r\n An inevitable consequence of climate change is \r\nunpredictability of the water supply. As a major food-\r\nproducing country, and in line with His Majesty the \r\nKing’s “Water is life” initiative, water conservation is a \r\nlong-term priority for the Thai Government. We have \r\nmade a commitment to increasing the country’s \r\nforested and water catchment areas. I would like to call \r\non all nations to make water management a priority on \r\nour climate change agenda as well. \r\n Thailand places great importance on promoting \r\nhuman security and is an active member of the Human \r\nSecurity Network. I have spoken about Thailand’s \r\nefforts to provide our people with freedom from want \r\nthrough democratic reform, respect for human rights \r\nand people-centred and sustainable development. The \r\nother side of human security is freedom from fear. As a \r\nresult of fear and mistrust, individuals and \r\ncommunities fall prey to extremist ideas that further \r\ndivide humanity. I strongly believe that the best \r\nstrategy to conquer such fear is winning hearts and \r\nminds, and Thailand is committed to fostering cross-\r\ncultural understanding. \r\n But terrorism continues to draw its strength from \r\nextremist ideologies. So we must appeal to the majority \r\nin the world who are moderates to join forces against \r\nextremism. In addition, enhancing inter- and intra-faith \r\ndialogue and dialogue among civilizations should take \r\nplace at the regional level. We are doing that in South-\r\nEast Asia. \r\n As a neighbouring country sharing a land border \r\nof more than 2,400 kilometres with Myanmar and \r\ncurrently hosting more than a million of its citizens, \r\nThailand is gravely concerned about what we are \r\nseeing and hearing about in Myanmar. Thailand and \r\nMyanmar, being predominantly Buddhist, share a \r\nbelief in non-violence and tolerance. Thailand \r\ntherefore finds unacceptable the commission of \r\nviolence and bodily harm to Buddhist monks and other \r\ndemonstrators in Yangon. \r\n This morning, the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) discussed the situation in Myanmar. \r\nASEAN is appalled to have received reports of the use \r\nof automatic weapons and demands that the Myanmar \r\nGovernment immediately desist from the use of \r\nviolence against demonstrators. ASEAN expressed \r\nrevulsion over reports that demonstrations in Myanmar \r\nare being suppressed by violent force and that there \r\nhave been a number of fatalities. We strongly urge \r\nMyanmar to exercise the utmost restraint, to seek a \r\npolitical solution and resume its efforts aimed at \r\nnational reconciliation with all parties concerned, and \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n21 07-51962 \r\n \r\nto work towards a peaceful transition to democracy. We \r\ncall for the release of all political detainees, including \r\nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi. \r\n ASEAN fully supports the decision of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to send Special Envoy Ibrahim \r\nGambari to Myanmar. We ask the Myanmar \r\nGovernment to cooperate fully and to work with him. \r\nMr. Gambari’s role as a neutral interlocutor among all \r\nthe parties can help to defuse the dangerous situation. \r\nASEAN urges Myanmar to grant him full access to all \r\nparties in the country, as it has done in the past. \r\n Thailand is undergoing changes that will make it \r\na more capable partner of the international community \r\nand the United Nations. At the regional level, Thailand \r\nis eager to work with our ASEAN partners to create a \r\ncloser community. Strengthened by a new Charter, \r\nASEAN will be able to cooperate more effectively with \r\nits United Nations partners.  \r\n Indeed, promoting closer cooperation between \r\nASEAN and the United Nations — two organizations \r\nthat share the same values and goals — will be one \r\ncontribution to restoring faith in the multilateral \r\nsystem. Another will be supporting ongoing United \r\nNations reform efforts. Together with Chile, South \r\nAfrica and Sweden, Thailand has put forth the Four \r\nNations Initiative proposals, aimed at improving the \r\ngovernance and management of the Secretariat on the \r\nbasis of increased accountability and transparency. \r\n Thailand’s cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations is being further \r\nenhanced by new people-centred initiatives. Our new \r\nconstitution provides for universal education and \r\nhealth care, gender equality, respect for children’s \r\nrights and a social safety net for the poor, the disabled \r\nand the elderly. More than ever before, we are \r\ncommitted to combating HIV/AIDS and other global \r\nhealth threats. \r\n In the area of poverty eradication, Thailand is \r\nalso committed to going beyond our borders to assist \r\nour friends and neighbours. Our Mae Fah Luang \r\nFoundation’s community development model is being \r\nreplicated in Afghanistan and Indonesia. Thai troops \r\nparticipating in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nare recognized for their contributions in rebuilding \r\nbasic infrastructures in post-conflict areas. \r\n We see that the immediate resumption of the \r\nDoha Round of multilateral trade negotiations is \r\nessential to help the developing world achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). And, as the \r\ntwelfth session of the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development, to be held in Accra next year, \r\napproaches, Thailand is looking forward to discussing \r\nideas for South-South and trilateral cooperation to \r\naddress the opportunities and challenges of \r\nglobalization for development. \r\n This has been a year of great reform for Thailand. \r\nThe current political and social reforms that are taking \r\nplace in my country will allow us to make greater \r\ncontributions to a world where people can live in \r\nsecurity and dignity, free from poverty and despair — a \r\nworld where the present generation enhances the \r\nability of future generations to meet their own needs. \r\n As the world grows smaller by the day, humanity, \r\nmore than ever before, is sharing a common destiny. \r\nOur faith in the United Nations and in the multilateral \r\nprocess must be equal to the challenges and \r\nopportunities facing us. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n General Surayud Chulanont, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Thailand, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Sir Michael Somare, Prime Minister of \r\nPapua New Guinea \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Papua New \r\nGuinea. \r\n Sir Michael Somare, Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Sir Michael Somare, Prime \r\nMinister of Papua New Guinea, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.  \r\n Sir Michael Somare (Papua New Guinea): I wish \r\nto express to Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session, Papua \r\nNew Guinea’s congratulations on his election. We \r\nassure him of my country’s full cooperation during his \r\npresidency. We compliment his predecessor, Her \r\nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 22 \r\n \r\nstewardship of our work during her tenure, and we \r\nwish her well in her future endeavours. \r\n I would like to express our support to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his leadership of the United Nations. Let me thank \r\nhim, in particular, for his courage and strong leadership \r\non the issue of climate change. By the same token, I \r\nwould also like to thank the staff of the Secretariat and \r\nall United Nations agencies who continue to give \r\nvaluable service to my country, Papua New Guinea. \r\n On 18 September 2007, two days after \r\ncelebrating 32 years of independence, Papua New \r\nGuinea convened its eighth National Parliament. This \r\nwas a result of another successful general election. \r\nDemocracy is a challenge, but Papua New Guinea \r\ncontinues to thrive under it. My country of more than \r\n800 tribes and languages continues to find in the \r\ndemocratic principles the binding force and unity in \r\ndiversity in the 32 years of unbroken democracy. \r\n Papua New Guinea remains committed to the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations. We \r\nagree with the President that we must continue to work \r\nwith common purpose to renew, modernize and \r\nstrengthen this Organization so it can rise to the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. \r\n The increasing incidence of human atrocities, \r\ngenocide and war, poverty, terrorism, HIV/AIDS, the \r\nresurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, the \r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, drug and \r\nhuman smuggling, environmental degradation and \r\nclimate change are issues that, we believe, the United \r\nNations is best placed to address. \r\n Again we agree with the President that global \r\nchallenges demand multilateral solutions. The United \r\nNations is the appropriate multilateral forum to take \r\nsuch action. That is why the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly deserves our highest attention. To \r\nrevitalize the Assembly is also to renew our faith in \r\neach other and in our common values and destiny. \r\n We strongly endorse the President’s five priority \r\nissues of climate change, financing for development, \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), countering terrorism, and the United Nations \r\nreform agenda. To complement efforts in other forums, \r\nPapua New Guinea with other countries of the Pacific \r\nregion has agreed to pool our limited resources under \r\nthe Pacific Plan, in order to address, as the basis of our \r\ncooperation, many of these same issues, in particular, \r\nsustainable development, climatic change and regional \r\nintegration. \r\n Let me turn now to an issue which my country \r\nfeels strongly about: climate change. To be clear, we \r\nare very concerned to see certain industrialized nations \r\nattempting to avoid responsibility for their own carbon \r\nemissions and shifting the focus to developing nations. \r\nOnly after industrialized nations take responsibility for \r\nthe consequences of their own actions will the pathway \r\nbecome clear for lasting solutions. \r\n However, as developing countries, we are willing \r\nto contribute equitably towards a sustainable future. \r\nDuring my earlier statements at the high-level event on \r\nclimate change, I put forward key principles needed to \r\nguide future international agreements on climate \r\nchange after the year 2012. \r\n The time for leadership is now. If we are to defeat \r\nthis self-inflicted calamity, we must succeed in six key \r\nareas: we must construct a shared vision for lower \r\nglobal greenhouse gas concentrations; we must \r\naggressively deepen reduction commitments by \r\nindustrialized countries; we must create more \r\nmechanisms to provide positive incentives for \r\ndeveloping countries; we must launch a global \r\nframework to reduce emissions from deforestation and \r\ndegradation; we must scale up adaptation financing for \r\nfuture generations; and we must mobilize sufficient \r\nand sustainable resources to support positive incentives \r\nand adaptation. \r\n The science is clear. Our planet is in distress. As \r\nco-inhabitants of this world, we all must address the \r\nroot causes of the problem. To succeed, leadership is \r\nrequired on both sides of the economic divide. \r\nTogether, and only together, we can grasp the \r\nchallenges before us and construct a sustainable future. \r\n Papua New Guinea supports the ongoing reforms \r\nin the United Nations Secretariat. In order to \r\nstrengthen it to better address some of the key \r\nchallenges facing the membership, reform should \r\nreflect the geopolitical, economic and social realities of \r\ntoday, taking into particular account the different levels \r\nof development facing the membership. Above all, the \r\nreform must be fair and equitable. \r\n Global trade today is uneven and characterized \r\nmore by unfair trade practices by those already holding \r\ndecided advantages than by the opportunities it offers \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n23 07-51962 \r\n \r\nto developing countries like Papua New Guinea. Our \r\nefforts to develop a more equitable trading order are \r\nhampered by the reluctance of our developed partners \r\nto open their economies and engage in genuine \r\ndevelopment discussions. \r\n The Doha Round of negotiations are at a critical \r\njuncture. We need to collectively ensure that those \r\nnegotiations are revived so that different trade needs of \r\nits members are addressed. \r\n Papua New Guinea has moved forward from an \r\nexport-driven economic growth strategy to a policy of \r\neconomic consolidation and empowerment. Its core \r\npolicy objective is to provide every Papua New \r\nGuinean equal opportunity to build home, community \r\nand country. To achieve this, strong emphasis will be \r\nplaced on agriculture, which has always been the \r\nmainstay of our rural populace. Along with this aim, \r\nrelevant infrastructure will be built to support that \r\nimportant sector. \r\n The country’s five-year medium-term development \r\nstrategy is being reviewed to strengthen its alignment \r\nwith the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nAchieving the MDGs by 2015 is a challenge that \r\nrequires our collective input in its implementation. \r\n We call on development partners, including the \r\nUnited Nations, to play a supportive role in \r\nimplementing and sustaining these activities. That can \r\nbe done through fair trade opportunities, equitable \r\nmarkets, increased foreign investment, transfer of \r\ntechnology, capacity-building and providing quality \r\noverseas development assistance. \r\n The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a serious threat to \r\nsocial and economic security in many of our countries. \r\nGreater efforts must be made to arrest it. In Papua New \r\nGuinea, my Government has passed HIV/AIDS \r\nlegislation underpinned by a comprehensive HIV/AIDS \r\npolicy framework. We consider HIV/AIDS to be a \r\ndevelopment issue and deal with it separately from \r\nother health issues. But our experience suggests that \r\nnational action alone is not enough. A concerted global \r\nresponse is required. HIV/AIDS is a threat that must be \r\naddressed on all fronts and by all countries. We thank \r\nthe United Nations and its related agencies for their \r\nefforts in addressing HIV/AIDS. We also thank former \r\nPresident of the United States, Mr. Bill Clinton, for his \r\ncontribution to this work in my country.  \r\n Of equal importance are the battles against \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. \r\nWhile, as a global community, we have focused on \r\nHIV/AIDS and avian flu, little attention is given to \r\nmalaria, which remains the biggest killer disease in my \r\ncountry. We therefore thank Mr. Bill Gates for \r\nassistance given to research work on malaria in Papua \r\nNew Guinea. We call upon development partners to \r\nsupport Papua New Guinea and other countries in \r\naddressing these challenges. \r\n  The President returned to the Chair. \r\n \r\n Despite many United Nations resolutions, the \r\nconflict in the Middle East remains unresolved. Papua \r\nNew Guinea appeals to all parties to the conflict, \r\nincluding those Powers that have the capacity to \r\ninfluence a positive outcome, to make the necessary \r\nconcessions for a peaceful resolution to this long-\r\nstanding issue. We appeal to all parties to make full use \r\nof the dispute-settlement procedures of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The work of the Special Committee on \r\nDecolonization remains unfinished. There are still 16 \r\nNon-Self-Governing Territories — some in the \r\nPacific — that have yet to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination. The forthcoming referendum in Tokelau \r\ndemonstrates once again the true spirit of cooperation \r\nbetween Tokelau and New Zealand. We congratulate \r\nboth Governments and assure the people of Tokelau of \r\nour respect for their ultimate decision. In the same \r\nvein, we hope that other Administering Powers will \r\nfollow the example of New Zealand and assist other \r\nterritories reach a decision of their choice. \r\n While our world today provides untold \r\nopportunities, we are at the same time faced with many \r\ncomplex challenges. We must renew our commitment \r\nto and faith in the United Nations and seek to reform it \r\nin ways that are reflective of the realities of today. \r\nThirty-two years ago, when I brought my nation to take \r\nits seat in the General Assembly, I said, and wish to \r\nreaffirm today, that, within the limits of our resources, \r\nPapua New Guinea will play an active and positive role \r\nin the United Nations. That commitment remains. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea for the statement he has just made. \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 24 \r\n \r\n  Sir Michael Somare, Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Sali Berisha, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Albania \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nAlbania. \r\n  Mr. Sali Berisha, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Albania, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Sali Berisha, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Albania, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Berisha (Albania): Please allow me, Sir, to \r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session and to \r\nwish you great success in that very important job. I \r\nwould also like to thank the outgoing President, \r\nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her valuable \r\ncontribution to the General Assembly. I also wish to \r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nleadership, his great efforts in support of peace and \r\ncooperation in the world and his contribution to \r\nstrengthening the United Nations and its institutions. \r\n As a representative of a country that suffered one \r\nof the most totalitarian of post-Second World War \r\ndictatorships, it is my deep conviction that defending \r\nand promoting freedom and its values and supporting \r\noppressed peoples in order that they may free \r\nthemselves from tyrannical regimes that continue to \r\nproduce human suffering, poverty, violence and \r\nterrorism should be the main priority of the \r\nOrganization. In that context, I would like to say that \r\nCentral Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans and the \r\nentire world are now freer and safer without the likes \r\nof Mullah Omar, Saddam Hussein and Slobodan \r\nMilosevic. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome the message of hope that President George W. \r\nBush and other leaders have sent from this rostrum to \r\nall the peoples of the world still living under tyrannical \r\nregimes. \r\n Albania is a small country, but one with a clear \r\nvocation and determination to strengthen freedom and \r\ndemocracy for its citizens. Albania is also deeply \r\ncommitted to making its modest contribution to peace \r\nand security in the world. We have established close \r\ncooperation with friendly countries and international \r\norganizations in the fight against terrorism. In that \r\nregard, our peacekeeping units have served or are \r\nserving in Bosnia, Georgia, Afghanistan and Iraq. I am \r\ndelighted to inform the Assembly that, in that same \r\nspirit, my Government has decided to contribute \r\nanother platoon to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. \r\n Albania has also been a staunch supporter of \r\ninternational efforts to limit the proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction and the unlawful use of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons, which pose a serious \r\nthreat to peace, security and stability. In that context, \r\namong other measures, we committed ourselves to the \r\nfull destruction of our stockpile of chemical weapons. \r\nIn July 2007, Albania became the first country in the \r\nworld free of chemical materials and armaments of any \r\nkind. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the \r\nGovernments of the United States, Germany, Italy, \r\nGreece and Switzerland, which provided valuable \r\nfinancial and technical assistance to achieve that \r\nimportant objective. \r\n We are successfully implementing a number of \r\nvery important programmes in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), \r\nUNICEF and many other United Nations agencies. \r\nAlbania became part of the effort to reform the United \r\nNations by voluntarily joining the One United Nations \r\nprogramme as a pilot country. We are currently \r\nworking with United Nations agencies in order to test \r\nthe One United Nations concept and to develop new \r\napproaches and models for partnership in the areas of \r\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance and the \r\nenvironment. The first results of the project are truly \r\nvery encouraging. We are fully committed to making \r\nevery effort in order to ensure that the initiative can \r\nbecome a success story. \r\n European integration and membership in NATO \r\nare two main objectives for Albania. We are committed \r\nto undertake any reform and take any step to achieve \r\nthose goals. A year ago, we signed a Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union (EU). \r\nWe are working seriously in every way to fulfil its \r\nstandards and obligations. At the same time, we have \r\nundertaken thorough reforms of our armed forces, with \r\nthe assistance of many NATO member countries. We \r\nare also working to strengthen the rule of law and \r\ndemocracy in our country. We are hopeful that by the \r\ntime of the next NATO summit, in Bucharest, we will \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n25 07-51962 \r\n \r\nbe in a position to deserve an invitation to join the \r\nalliance. \r\n It was not long ago that the Balkans was the stage \r\nfor human tragedies, brutal wars and ethnic cleansing \r\nbased on the concept of a “greater country” and fuelled \r\nby the extreme nationalism and racism of a nation that \r\nwas consumed by the idea of its own hegemony over \r\nothers. But in a few years, the Balkan countries have \r\nmanaged to transit from the age of dictatorships, hatred \r\nand conflicts into an age of peace, cooperation, \r\nfriendship and integration. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to thank all \r\nthe Governments and taxpayers of the countries \r\nmembers of NATO, the EU and the United Nations, as \r\nwell as the other organizations whose support and \r\nassistance was so important in bringing about that \r\nhistoric change. However, I believe that a final solution \r\nto the issue of Kosova’s status that fully respects the \r\nexpressed will of its citizens for independence is a \r\nfundamental precondition for durable peace and \r\nstability, not only in Kosova but in the entire region as \r\nwell. Albania fully supported President Ahtisaari’s \r\nproject and the efforts of the Troika for the solution for \r\nthe final status. \r\n Due to the lack of realism and the ghost of a \r\ngreater Serbia, Belgrade turned down President \r\nAhtisaari’s project, which sets forth and guarantees the \r\nhighest, by far, European standards for the Serb \r\nminorities in Kosova, standards that, in truth, are much \r\nmore advanced than those enjoyed by the Albanians \r\nliving in southern Serbia. \r\n Rejection of the Ahtisaari package is unhelpful \r\nand proves that what matters first for Belgrade is not \r\nthe freedom and rights of Serbs in Kosova, but rather \r\nthe idea of a greater Serbia. Such a stance by Belgrade \r\nhas been encouraged by the Russian position in the \r\nSecurity Council with regard to Ahtisaari’s project, a \r\nposition that, despite its motivation, does not \r\ncontribute to peace and stability in the region. \r\n Claims that Kosova’s independence sets an \r\ninternational precedent or lays conditions for the \r\ncreation of a greater Albania, as well as the fear of two \r\nAlbanian states in the Balkans, are unfounded. Those \r\nwho are interested in the truth and in reality can easily \r\nrealize that Kosova is a unique case, from both the \r\nhistorical and current perspectives. \r\n For more than five centuries, from the end of the \r\nthirteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, \r\nKosova was a part of the Ottoman Empire, inhabited \r\nmainly by native Albanians whose roots and shelter \r\nhad been there since the very beginning. Only at the \r\nstart of the last century, in one of the greatest historic \r\ninjustices, Kosova was separated from the Albanian \r\nterritory and given in tribute to Serbia — for the sole \r\nreason that it was part of an empire that lost the war. \r\n Kosova is also a unique case in her sufferings. \r\nDuring the past century, the implementation of the \r\nCubrilovic doctrine of extreme racism and \r\nextermination against Albanians turned them into third-\r\nclass citizens and turned Kosova into an arena of ethnic \r\ncleansing and real apartheid. \r\n It is also a unique case because the last Serbian \r\ngenocide against Albanians, in 1999, which caused \r\nthousands of atrocities among innocent populations, \r\nmultiple massive graves and the destruction and \r\nburning of more than 130 thousand homes, schools and \r\nhospitals, obliged the North Atlantic alliance to \r\nundertake its greatest offensive to protect human rights \r\nand freedom there. \r\n Kosova is also a unique case from a legal \r\nstandpoint, because during Josip Broz Tito’s regime it \r\nwas a constitutional entity of the Yugoslav federation, \r\nenjoying its veto rights in the federal Government. \r\nDuring this time, Kosova chaired the Yugoslav \r\nfederation for several terms, based on the leadership \r\nrotation principle within Yugoslavia. \r\n The claim that the independence of Kosova could \r\nlead to the creation of a greater Albania cannot be \r\nfarther from the truth. In reality, Kosova’s \r\nindependence will only end the fluidity of Albanians in \r\nthe Balkans, along with the idea of the creation of a \r\nsingle Albanian State in the territories where they are a \r\ndominant majority. The simple truth is that Kosova \r\nAlbanians have decided in their great project for the \r\nfuture to join Brussels and not to join Tirana. \r\n On the other hand, I would like to guarantee that \r\nAlbania remains determined to fully respect the \r\ninternational borders of its neighbours, including those \r\nof Kosova. Albania is closely collaborating and will \r\ncontinue to cooperate bilaterally with all countries in \r\nthe region, including Serbia, in the process of regional, \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration. I believe that \r\nthe concern about two independent Albanian States in \r\nthe Balkans is xenophobic. Two democratic States with \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 26 \r\n \r\nan Albanian majority will be two more countries \r\nfriendly to their neighbours. \r\n I would like to urge the political leadership of \r\nKosova to refrain from taking unilateral actions. They \r\nshould continue, as they have done so far, to cooperate \r\nwith the Contact Group and the international \r\ncommunity in seeking a solution for the final status of \r\nKosova, with full respect for its will and the dignity it \r\ndeserves. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the political leadership of Kosova for \r\nsubmitting a treaty of reconciliation, friendship and \r\ncooperation with Serbia — a treaty inspired by the \r\nhighest European values and the best of European \r\nheritage. I hope and wish that Serbia would take up this \r\nimportant opportunity, because I believe that peace and \r\ncoexistence between Albanians and Serbs in the \r\nBalkans will best benefit both of these nations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Albania for the statement he has just made.  \r\n  Mr. Berisha, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by the Honourable Nguyen Tan Dung, Prime \r\nMinister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic \r\nof Viet Nam  \r\n  The Honourable Nguyen Tan Dung, Prime \r\nMinister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Nguyen Tan Dung, Prime \r\nMinister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Dung (spoke in Vietnamese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): Mr. President, at the \r\noutset, permit me to extend to you my warmest \r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I believe \r\nthat with your immense competence, you will lead this \r\nsession to a successful conclusion. I highly commend \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon for his important contributions as the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. I respectfully \r\nconvey to all delegates and, through them, to the \r\npeople of all Member countries, the greetings of \r\nfriendship from the Vietnamese people. \r\n When humankind entered the new millennium, \r\nwe all wished for a more peaceful world, more friendly \r\ninternational relations and a better life. Nearly a decade \r\nhas elapsed, but that wish has not come true. We are \r\nstill living in a world blessed with numerous \r\nopportunities and at the same time beset with \r\nadversities and challenges. It is a blessing that since \r\nthe establishment of the United Nations, humankind \r\nhas not experienced any more world wars. However, \r\nlocal wars and conflicts, international terrorism and the \r\ncontinuing arms race, including the nuclear arms race, \r\nremain daunting threats to our world today. \r\n Thanks to the miraculous scientific and \r\ntechnological achievements, human living conditions \r\nhave improved continuously. However, there remains a \r\nbitter reality that the gap in living standards between \r\nnations and population groups is increasing. Nearly \r\n1 billion people are still living in extreme poverty. At \r\nthe same time, many pressing global issues have \r\nemerged, of which epidemics, environmental pollution \r\nand climate change have proved to be serious threats to \r\nhuman life.  \r\n We note with satisfaction the rapid proliferation \r\nof regional and global cooperation arrangements. In the \r\nmeantime, the world is yet to be free from tense \r\nconfrontation, acts of unilateral imposition, violations \r\nof national independence and sovereignty, inequality \r\nand unfair treatment in international relations. \r\n All these require that together we make greater \r\nefforts to maintain peace and stability in all parts of the \r\nworld, promote equal cooperative relations between \r\nand among States, and ensure an international \r\nenvironment conducive to the development of each and \r\nevery nation. \r\n In the face of enormous challenges in the new \r\nmillennium, peoples of the world had high expectations \r\nof the United Nations and, in that connection, Viet \r\nNam fully associates itself with the orientations \r\ncharted by the United Nations summits in 2000 and \r\n2005 for the work of the Organization in consolidating \r\npeace, security, cooperation and development. \r\n We hope that the United Nations will, together \r\nwith Member States, intensify efforts to establish long-\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East — including efforts \r\naimed at an appropriate solution to the Israel-Palestine \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n27 07-51962 \r\n \r\nconflict — put an end to conflicts and violence in a \r\nnumber of African countries, restore stability in Iraq \r\nand Afghanistan and control and prevent the \r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Viet Nam supports \r\nthe settlement of the Korean Peninsula issues through \r\ndialogue, in conformity with international law, and \r\nshares the Korean people’s desire for peaceful \r\nreunification. \r\n The United Nations Millennium Declaration of \r\n2000 and its policy of promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment and ensuring the harmonious combination \r\nof economic growth with social equity and \r\nenvironmental protection have elicited practical \r\nresponses from Member States. Viet Nam hopes that \r\nthe United Nations will play a more active role in that \r\nprocess in order to create further opportunities for \r\nunderdeveloped countries to escape poverty and \r\nadvance with the mainstream countries of the world. In \r\nthat light, Viet Nam hopes that the Doha Round will be \r\nconcluded soon to facilitate a fair international trading \r\nsystem. \r\n Viet Nam strongly supports development \r\ncooperation between countries and the establishment of \r\nequal international relations in economic, financial and \r\ntrade areas with special attention paid to the needs of \r\ndeveloping and least developed countries, including the \r\nremoval of imposed economic blockades and \r\nembargoes. We hope that the United Nations will have \r\nmore resources for development cooperation, with \r\npriority given to the implementation of programmes of \r\naction on poverty reduction, advancement of women, \r\nchild care, population planning and HIV/AIDS \r\nprevention. Viet Nam strongly supports common \r\nefforts, especially the efforts of the United Nations, to \r\nprotect the environment and to better respond to \r\nclimate change. \r\n For the United Nations to fulfil its noble mandate \r\nin a vastly changed world, the question of United \r\nNations reform has been raised and keenly discussed. \r\nViet Nam holds that the process of reform should be \r\nintensified and goes along with the common \r\nunderstanding that the reforms should ensure the broad \r\nparticipation of all Member States and should be \r\ncarried out in a transparent manner. Reform should also \r\nbuild upon past experience and, at the same, have a \r\ncomprehensive forward-looking vision. \r\n In 1945, the United Nations was founded, right at \r\na time when the Vietnamese people had just gained \r\ntheir independence. Stemming from the belief in the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations and the \r\ndesire to contribute to the work of that new \r\ninternational organization, as early as in January 1946, \r\nPresident Ho Chi Minh, the founder of the new \r\nVietnamese State, wrote to the first session of the \r\nUnited Nations General Assembly, stating clearly, “Our \r\nnation has gained independence and earnestly requests \r\nthat you recognize our independence and admit our \r\nnation into the United Nations”. \r\n Regrettably, it was not until 1977 that Viet Nam \r\nbecame a full Member of the United Nations. Over the \r\npast 30 years in its capacity as a United Nations \r\nMember, Viet Nam has always worked actively for \r\npeace, stability, cooperation and development in the \r\nworld. Viet Nam has made significant contributions to \r\nturning South-East Asia from a war-divided region of \r\nconfrontation into one of peace, friendship and \r\ncooperation, which is now moving towards an \r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nCommunity based on the three pillars: political and \r\nsecurity matters, economic matters, and cultural and \r\nsocial matters. \r\n It is our consistent position to support efforts \r\ntowards the peaceful settlement of conflicts, upholding \r\nnational independence and state sovereignty, promoting \r\ndevelopment programmes, tackling global social issues \r\nand establishing equal international political and \r\neconomic relations for mutual benefit. \r\n Viet Nam will continue with its policy of being a \r\nfriend and reliable partner to all countries, striving for \r\npeace, independence, cooperation and development. \r\nWe have established diplomatic relations with 174 \r\ncountries and economic and trade ties with almost all \r\ncountries and territories in the world. Viet Nam is an \r\nactive member of many other regional and global \r\norganizations and forums. Most recently, Viet Nam \r\njoined the World Trade Organization as its 150th \r\nmember. Viet Nam has been elected to the governing \r\npositions of many United Nations bodies and is now \r\nworking closely with United Nations development \r\norganizations to implement the “One United Nations” \r\ninitiative in Viet Nam as a pilot country. \r\n We highly appreciate the assistance and support \r\nextended by United Nations organizations to Viet Nam. \r\nOur significant achievements in socio-economic \r\ndevelopment have enabled Viet Nam to fulfil a number \r\nof Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule, \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 28 \r\n \r\nespecially in poverty reduction. That is also \r\nattributable to the support of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n We consider it important to promote South-South \r\ncooperation. Despite being a poor country, we \r\nparticipated actively in the tripartite cooperation \r\narrangement between Viet Nam and a United Nations \r\nagency to support African countries in the agricultural \r\nsector. So far, that programme has produced \r\nencouraging results. \r\n With the desire to make further contributions to \r\nthe work of the international community, in 1997 Viet \r\nNam decided to run for a non-permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council for the 2008-2009 term. I take the \r\nopportunity to sincerely thank the Asian Group for \r\nendorsing Viet Nam as the only candidate of the \r\ncontinent. We are also grateful to other Member States \r\nfor their broad support. \r\n Viet Nam is fully aware of the great honour and \r\nheavy responsibility of being a non-permanent member \r\nof the Security Council, a body entrusted with the \r\nprimary mission of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. If elected, Viet Nam will fully adhere to the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter and will do its utmost to cooperate \r\nwith other members to fulfil that important task. \r\n Viet Nam will work closely with other countries \r\nto reduce tension and to prevent and peacefully settle \r\nconflicts in different parts of the world. We will fulfil \r\nour obligations as a party to all major international \r\nconventions and treaties on the non-proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction. We condemn, and are \r\nalso committed to the elimination of, international \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and in \r\naccordance with international law. \r\n Viet Nam welcomes and is willing to participate \r\nin mechanisms both within and outside the Security \r\nCouncil to increase assistance aimed at the national \r\nreconstruction and development of conflict-ridden \r\ncountries. As a nation that has experienced post-war \r\nreconstruction and has accomplished important \r\nachievements on its development path, Viet Nam also \r\nwishes to share its experiences with other countries \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n Mindful of the active role played by United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations, Viet Nam has made \r\nfinancial contributions to and participated in a number \r\nof United Nations activities to restore peace in various \r\ncountries. We are completing the preparatory process \r\nfor our effective participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, in keeping with our \r\ncircumstances and capacity. \r\n We share the view that, if the Security Council is \r\nto work more effectively, it must be further reformed to \r\nachieve greater representativeness and greater \r\ndemocracy in its working methods. We also support \r\nstrengthening the Council’s relationships with regional \r\norganizations. It is therefore encouraging that, at the \r\npresent session, the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations and the United Nations just signed a \r\ncooperation agreement. \r\n I believe that, as a result of its open and \r\nconstructive foreign policy and its active contributions \r\nto international peace and security and development \r\ncooperation, Viet Nam will receive full support from \r\nall Member States for its candidature for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2008-2009. We will do whatever we can to fulfil \r\nthat important aspiration.  \r\n Viet Nam will always be an active, constructive, \r\ncooperative and responsible member of the \r\ninternational community, living up to the expectations \r\nof all Member States. On behalf of the Government and \r\nthe people of Viet Nam, I express the sincere hope that \r\nthe sixty-second session of the General Assembly will \r\nbe successful, meeting the expectations of the peoples \r\nof the world in the service of peace, security, \r\ncooperation and development. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n  Mr. Nguyen Tan Dung, Prime Minister of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Lansana Kouyaté, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minster of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea. \r\n  Mr. Lansana Kouyaté, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n29 07-51962 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Lansana \r\nKouyaté, Prime Minister of the Republic of Guinea, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Kouyaté (Guinea) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like at the outset to convey to all members \r\nfriendly greetings from Guinea, its people and its \r\nPresident, General Lansana Conté. To the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session and to \r\nthe Secretary-General of our Organization, I wish to \r\nconvey the same greetings and to express our heartfelt \r\nwishes for every success. \r\n The agenda of the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly places before us all the essential \r\nissues challenging the world: the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, the development of \r\nAfrica, the promotion of human rights, climate change, \r\nthe promotion of justice and international law, \r\ndisarmament, the fight against illicit drugs and the \r\nfight against terrorism. Those subjects are timely today, \r\nbut they were also timely yesterday and will probably \r\nremain so tomorrow. They are part of man’s long \r\nattempt to meet the principal challenge facing him \r\nsince the dawn of his existence nearly 3 million years \r\nago: his survival. \r\n Today more than ever before, that survival is \r\nthreatened by a serious lack of respect for the \r\nenvironment. Man emerged from a hostile natural \r\nenvironment, which he tamed in many ways before he \r\nbegan to dangerously threaten it through his appetite \r\nfor absolute power and his desire for comfort and well-\r\nbeing. Where will this tyranny end? Science has \r\nsounded the alarm, although the mobilization consists \r\nmore of words than of deeds, more of intention than of \r\nreality. In this very Hall, during the High-level Event \r\non Climate Change, we absorbed all the information \r\nprovided by scientists, who concluded that action was \r\nurgent. It is paradoxical to note that, after having \r\nsearched desperately for life on other planets without \r\nfinding it, man does not realize that, for the time being, \r\nhe is unique in the immensity of the cosmos. \r\n That unique existence in the Milky Way must \r\ncontinue at all costs, and that is within our reach. The \r\ndetermination that inspired the Organization’s founding \r\nnations to put the world’s affairs in order and forever \r\nbanish the spectre of war should be the same \r\ndetermination that leads all nations of the Earth to take \r\nconcrete and immediate measures to put an end to \r\nenvironmental degradation.  \r\n Every time human beings have wanted to do \r\nsomething, they have been able to do it. However, that \r\nresolve should not contain secret vices. For example, it \r\nshould not consist of imposing restrictions on poor \r\ncountries’ use of their forest resources, as if such \r\nrestrictions were an angelic service to humanity. A \r\nbalance is possible between environmental protection \r\nand the essential will to achieve development. A \r\nnumber of great world leaders have advocated just \r\ncompensation to Africa for the exploitation of its \r\nnatural resources. Africa should be grateful for that. \r\n But the continent’s needs go well beyond that. \r\nAfrica no longer wants to be confined to the simple \r\nrole of supplier of raw materials; it wishes to process \r\nthem in order to create more jobs and added value so as \r\nto create more wealth. The technologies that need to be \r\ntransferred today are those that guarantee better \r\nproductivity while respecting the ecosystem. \r\n The issues facing humanity today cannot be \r\naddressed by any one country in isolation. The United \r\nNations, because it embodies our common destiny, \r\nmust be the place where our fears, our anxieties, our \r\nvisions and our proposals, but also our hopes, come \r\ntogether. But if it is to play such a role, the United \r\nNations must be just and equitable both in its structures \r\nand in its decision-making mechanisms.  \r\n The Second World War, which was the tragic \r\nvehicle that fortunately led to the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations, spared no nation, race or continent. \r\nReform of the Security Council in particular and of \r\nother United Nations organs in general must take \r\naccount not only of that historic reality, but also of the \r\ninevitably universal nature of the problems besetting \r\nus.  \r\n How can we put an end to terrorism unless we \r\ntake into account the ferment that would characterize \r\nthe dialogue among civilizations, cultures and religions \r\nand enhance mutual understanding and tolerance? How \r\ncan we overcome HIV/AIDS if profit remains the \r\ncriterion that guides the pharmaceutical laboratories? \r\nHow do we put an end to the inexorable degradation of \r\nthe environment when powerful corporations care little \r\nfor the future of the planet? How do we eradicate the \r\nscourge of drugs when drug traffickers are irresistibly \r\ndrawn to easy money? All of those questions call for \r\nsolidarity, vision and joint action. We cannot improve \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 30 \r\n \r\non the brilliant and poignant analyses that have already \r\nbeen made here in this legendary Hall, but the \r\ndifference that we can make is to take action.  \r\n We should remember that many of the \r\ncommitments entered into on many fronts have not \r\nbeen respected by the United Nations, nor by the \r\ngroups of countries represented in specific \r\norganizations. Allow me to give you several examples. \r\n In 1974, the most highly industrialized countries \r\npromised to eliminate world poverty in the year 2000. \r\nThat was a mythical year, the year 2000. For that \r\npurpose, they undertook to allocate 0.7 per cent of their \r\ngross domestic product to official development \r\nassistance.  \r\n In 1989, 15 years later, amidst the euphoria \r\narising from the fall of the Berlin Wall, the same \r\nPowers foretold an era of universal peace by the end of \r\nthe twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. They foretold that the funds previously \r\ndedicated to the arms race would henceforth be \r\ndevoted to accelerating the eradication of poverty, \r\nwhich they said would become effective in 2000. \r\nUnfortunately, those predictions were disproved by \r\nreality.  \r\n Poverty in the world has certainly not been \r\neliminated, it has increased since the beginning of the \r\n1990s. Over 100 million people joined the ranks of the \r\npoor in 2003 alone. In September 2000, in this same \r\nHall that, at the time, applauded those aborted hopes, \r\nthe heads of State and Government of the world \r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration. The Declaration \r\nimplicitly recognized the inescapable nature of poverty, \r\nrejecting the goals set in 1974 and admitted that it \r\nwould only be possible to halve the number of poor \r\npeople in the world by 2015.  \r\n Today, midway towards the achievement of the \r\ngoals of that Declaration, which did, however, \r\ncrystallize so many dreams and hopes for the younger \r\ngenerations of the world, all the experts’ reports agree \r\nthat the Millennium Development Goals will only be \r\nachieved if we change the strategies and rules that \r\nshape our world today.  \r\n Instead of a new dawn of global peace, localized \r\nwars that rip through the protective membrane of the \r\nentrenched and now-defunct bipolar global system now \r\nappear in successive waves in Europe, Africa and Asia. \r\nThe nuclear threat has not disappeared. Is nuclear \r\nenergy, whether put to civilian or military uses, \r\nactually essential to the life of mankind? Nuclear \r\npower certainly is useful when used for civilian \r\npurposes, but will always be a threat to humankind — \r\nboth for those who possess it and those who aspire to \r\npossess it — when used for military purposes. It is the \r\nlogic of rivalry between nations that has led to the \r\nlogic of the arms race and the theory of deterrence is \r\nonly a subset of that logic. The best deterrence is the \r\ntotal absence of nuclear weapons. \r\n The effort to combat terrorism is another \r\nchallenge, the challenge that is played out in a \r\nManichean manner, evil and good opposing each other. \r\nAlthough no attenuating circumstances can be granted \r\nto those who subscribe to the philosophy of terror, the \r\nrealities on which that philosophy seems to be based \r\nmust nevertheless be eradicated: injustice in the \r\nmanagement of world affairs, intolerance in the \r\nperception of differences between cultures and \r\ncynicism expressed in the theory of natural differences \r\namong races.  \r\n The success of human rights and worldwide \r\ndemocracy is to be won at that price. Indeed, the great \r\nWestern Powers, who have guaranteed so much to their \r\npeoples in terms of freedom, equality and respect for \r\nthe fundamental values of mankind must show greater \r\nrigor in peacefully promoting the same principles at the \r\nglobal level. They currently give us cause to believe \r\nthat they frequently choose their immediate interests \r\nabove the principles in which they believe, although \r\nthey have good reason to believe in those principles. \r\n All of the heads of State and Government of the \r\nAfrican continent and of many other countries that \r\nhave come before this rostrum have eloquently \r\naddressed the issues confronting poor countries. I \r\nwould like to only briefly touch upon them. Trapped in \r\na vicious circle resulting from the conjunction of bad \r\ngovernance, ever-growing poverty and the Gordian \r\nknot of irreducible external debt and unfair capital \r\nmarkets, poor countries are steadily deteriorating. \r\nOften transformed into sanctuaries for rebel armed \r\ngroups, they have become the site of civil wars, with \r\ntheir trails of refugees and massive population \r\ndisplacements. Those devastated societies feed \r\nmigratory flows and provide an ideal refuge for the \r\nmafia networks of organized crime. The traffic in small \r\narms and light weapons knows no borders and the \r\nweapons end up in the trained hands of child soldiers.  \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n31 07-51962 \r\n \r\n I do not believe in the inevitability of poverty nor \r\nin that of war. Failures in those areas can be clearly \r\nexplained. The dominant groups of the rich countries \r\nand the elites who are charged with governance in poor \r\ncountries are both responsible for the failure of the \r\nfight against poverty and for not having met the \r\ncommitments taken in 1974. What is worse, they have \r\ngiven preference to commercial, financial and \r\ntechnological policies and strategies that have \r\nreinforced the causes of the ongoing impoverishment \r\nof poor populations worldwide. With respect to the \r\nfailure of the pledge for universal peace, it is due to the \r\nconcepts and political strategies put in place by the \r\ndominant groups and leaders of the world who have \r\nopted for reaction over prevention. \r\n There are solutions to counter poverty and to \r\nbring the world out of this pattern of permanent war. \r\nInspired by the shared destiny of mankind, our dream \r\nof universal peace still has every chance of coming \r\ntrue. It would involve promoting a global economic \r\nsystem based on a series of common goods and global \r\npublic services that must be provided and overseen by \r\nthe global collective. That is certainly not out of reach.  \r\n To eradicate poverty, we must declare it illegal in \r\nprinciple and unacceptable as a phenomenon. \r\nDeclaring that poverty is illegal means specifically \r\nabolishing the legislative and administrative provisions \r\nthat sustain the mechanisms that create and maintain \r\npoverty around the world. It is that new momentum of \r\ncommitment and collective responsibility towards the \r\neradication of poverty and towards guaranteed peace \r\nthat will open the way to resolving the many other \r\nmajor challenges that face our time. Of course, the \r\nquestion remains; is our contemporary society, replete \r\nwith its unprecedented global capacities in the area of \r\nknow-how, technologies, finance and mobilization of \r\nhuman resources made up, in its essence, not of \r\nconquerors but of builders of peace and security who \r\nare sufficiently courageous and daring to be able to \r\nchange the current patterns that mould and forge our \r\nworld?  \r\n Let us take an example from the nineteenth \r\ncentury, which was a time when the world was \r\nsuccessful in initiating the process of completely \r\neradicating the age-old practice of slavery, which had \r\nuntil then been considered to be natural and immutable. \r\nThat required the courageous leaders of the time to \r\ndeclare the practice illegal, at the cost of their own \r\nlives at times. The heroic victory of the Allies during \r\nthe Second World War was due to a commitment of a \r\nsimilar nature. Similarly, was it not thanks to their firm \r\ncommitment that the major leaders of the world \r\nrecently succeeded in abolishing the shameful system \r\nof apartheid and replacing it with a democracy of \r\nexceptional vitality? \r\n If leaders of that calibre illuminated our past, I \r\nam confident that there still exist today those who are \r\ncapable of changing our world to make a happy legacy \r\nfor future generations. \r\n In January and February 2007, the Republic of \r\nGuinea was beset by an unprecedented socio-political \r\ncrisis that threatened its social stability and the \r\nfoundations of its institutions. The cause was the \r\nconvergence of a cumulative lack of good governance, \r\nrampant poverty and an overall economic situation in \r\nwhich all of the financial and monetary indicators were \r\nin the red. These tragic events, marked by considerable \r\nloss of human life, led to massive destruction of public \r\nbuildings and involved a great erosion of State \r\nauthority, creating, at the same time, profound rifts in \r\nthe social fabric.  \r\n Fortunately, the outcome, although it remains \r\nfragile, was a peaceful one and is under the auspices of \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS) and the United Nations. It is owes its \r\nexistence to the combined efforts of the presidential \r\nauthority, the unions, civil society, eminent persons and \r\nfriends of Guinea worldwide. \r\n From this rostrum, I express the deep gratitude \r\nand great thanks of the people and the Government of \r\nGuinea to all those entities and individuals who were \r\ninvolved to ensure that civic peace would reign in our \r\ncountry.  \r\n The Government that came out of these events, a \r\nGovernment that it is my privilege to lead, is doing its \r\nutmost to try to meet the many expectations of a people \r\nthat has become impatient because it has waited far too \r\nlong. A minimum emergency plan was crafted for the \r\nshort and medium terms.  \r\n Let me conclude by saying that the initiatives \r\nplanned for by my Government, as promising as they \r\nare, continue to be dependent upon the interest that \r\nworld leaders give to all the subjects that I raised due \r\nto my deepest convictions. Beyond the commitment of \r\nour elites and civil society to good governance and \r\ndemocracy, the Republic of Guinea needs an effective \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 32 \r\n \r\npartnership in keeping with its specific and pressing \r\nneeds. This partnership, for which the Guinean people \r\nwholeheartedly calls, will be more appropriate, \r\neffective and lasting if the dominant groups of the \r\nworld agree to commit to global solidarity in the \r\nservice of humankind’s development. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Guinea for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Lansana Kouyaté, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.  \r\n Mr. Outlule (Botswana), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Martin Nduwimana, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Burundi. \r\n Mr. Martin Nduwimana, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Martin Nduwimana, \r\nVice-President of Burundi, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Nduwimana (Burundi) (spoke in French): \r\nFirst of all, we would like to extend to Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim our warmest congratulations on his unanimous \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly for the \r\ncurrent session and to say that the delegation that I \r\nhave the honour of leading is greatly pleased to see \r\nhim presiding over the work of the Assembly. We \r\nwould like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the \r\noutgoing President, who conducted the work of the last \r\nsession with great wisdom and distinction. \r\n We would also like to convey to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the great appreciation and \r\nencouragement of His Excellency Mr. Pierre \r\nNkurunziza, President of the Republic of Burundi, and \r\nof our Government, for the tireless efforts that he has \r\nbeen making since he took office to defend and \r\npromote the noble ideals of our Organization. \r\n Building a viable world for humanity is a task \r\nthat is incumbent upon the international community \r\nand every one of its members. Our position in Burundi \r\nis that, in strengthening peace and justice within our \r\nborders, we are also contributing to the harmonious \r\ndevelopment of this world. It is in this context that the \r\nGovernment of Burundi is sparing no effort both within \r\nthe country and at the regional level to establish an \r\nenvironment conducive to the strengthening of peace \r\nand security, the rule of law and development. \r\n We are pleased to state that the signing of the \r\nComprehensive Ceasefire Agreement, which took place \r\non 7 September 2006 between the Government and the \r\nForces nationales de libération (FNL) rebel movement \r\ngreatly contributed to a return to peace and stability in \r\nour country. That paved the way for talks on specific \r\naspects concerning the implementation of the \r\nAgreement in a calm setting. Some weeks ago, the FNL \r\nmovement unilaterally decided to suspend the talks \r\nwithout offering any truly convincing reasons. \r\nHowever, we are not discouraged because we believe \r\nthat this is simply a hitch that will not have a lasting \r\nimpact on the gains which everyone wants to preserve. \r\n Efforts are currently being made for a prompt \r\nresumption of the talks. A regional summit on the issue \r\nshould take place shortly to encourage the FNL \r\nmovement to return to the negotiating table, which is \r\nthe only acceptable way to achieve a lasting peace. In \r\nany case, the Government of Burundi remains open to \r\nall proposals that would bring together the necessary \r\nconditions for this effort. \r\n The return to peace has also favoured the \r\nimplementation of programmes that are priorities for \r\nthe Government in areas such as national \r\nreconciliation, education and health for all, \r\nreconstruction and economic recovery. Issues related to \r\ngood political and economic governance, once taboo \r\nbecause of their sensitive nature, are now openly and \r\nregularly discussed, and concrete action is being taken \r\nto improve the situation. \r\n To achieve greater success in the delicate task of \r\nnational reconciliation, the people of Burundi have no \r\nchoice but to review together the history of their \r\ncountry which, in several ways, is characterized by \r\nsome dark periods. Indeed, the Government has begun \r\nnegotiations with the Secretary-General in order to set \r\nup a truth and reconciliation commission. We are soon \r\ngoing to begin national consultations on this question; \r\nthe outcome should provide a solid basis for the \r\nestablishment and operation of such a Commission. \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n33 07-51962 \r\n \r\n The civil war which ravaged our country greatly \r\nimpoverished the Burundian population. We are eager \r\nto gradually resolve the problem of poverty and to \r\nreach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), we \r\nhave taken measures to offer free health care to \r\nchildren under the age of five and to pregnant mothers \r\nin public health clinics, and also to provide free \r\nprimary school education. \r\n The Government has also set up the Strategic \r\nFramework for Accelerating Economic Growth and \r\nReducing Poverty, which was adopted at the national \r\nand international levels and which was submitted to \r\nour development partners at the Bujumbura round table \r\nheld in May 2007. Our country’s appeal to the \r\ninternational community had a positive reception: \r\nfunding for our priority programmes for the period \r\n2007-2010 has been pledged.  \r\n We take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude \r\nof the Government and the people of Burundi to all of \r\nour partners for their generous contributions at the \r\nround table. We would be sincerely grateful if their \r\npledges could be redeemed so that we can satisfy the \r\nmost urgent needs of our population as soon as \r\npossible.  \r\n Working with the Peacebuilding Commission, my \r\nGovernment has also set up a Strategic Framework for \r\nPeacebuilding in Burundi. This is a framework that \r\ninvolves all of the national and international socio-\r\npolitical partners in contributing to strengthening the \r\nreturn to peace and ensuring that the resurgence of \r\ndeadly crises will be a thing of the past. \r\n We would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our gratitude to the Commission for the \r\npositive results we have already achieved together, as \r\nwell as for the support of the Peacebuilding Fund, from \r\nwhich my country has generously benefited. \r\n We are convinced that peace and security can be \r\naffirmed only in one’s house and in one’s immediate \r\nenvironment. Burundi is playing an active role within \r\nthe regional framework in the work of the Tripartite \r\nPlus Joint Commission, including the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. \r\nThis Commission is a suitable forum for us to discuss \r\nour security issues in a straightforward fashion — \r\nnamely, the presence of many armed groups that are \r\ncirculating and dangerously jeopardizing the \r\ndemocratic gains made in the development of our \r\nmember countries. Moreover, on 15 December 2006, at \r\nthe International Conference of the Great Lakes region, \r\nheads of State and Government of 11 member \r\ncountries, including our own country, Burundi, signed \r\na Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the \r\nGreat Lakes Region, with the ultimate objective of \r\nmaking this zone an area of peace, economic growth \r\nand sustainable and shared growth. Burundi had the \r\nhonour of being elected by its peers to host the \r\nheadquarters of the Executive Secretariat of this \r\nConference. \r\n Furthermore, in re-launching the Economic \r\nCommunity of the Great Lakes countries (CEPGL), \r\nalong with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, and in joining the East African Community, \r\nwhich includes the United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nUganda, Kenya and Rwanda, we are motivated by a \r\ndesire to build a peaceful, prosperous and united world. \r\n There are still tensions that mark the international \r\nsituation and new sources of instability and uncertainty \r\nhave emerged. It is undeniable that remarkable work \r\nhas been achieved in recent years within the framework \r\nof our Organization, as well as in continental and \r\nregional organizations. Pockets of tension have now \r\nbeen eliminated, and others are on the verge of being \r\nso. However, we are concerned by the continuation of \r\nbloody conflicts in Somalia and Darfur, in Iraq, in the \r\nMiddle East, to mention but a few. Despite the efforts \r\nthat have been made and the means that have been \r\ndeployed, there is still a great deal to be done. Burundi \r\ndecided to lend its modest contribution to resolving \r\nsome of these crises by providing military observers \r\nand police personnel for Darfur and military \r\npeacekeeping contingents in Somalia within the \r\nframework of operations set up by the African Union. \r\n We know full well that conflict prevention is an \r\nongoing concern of the international community. \r\nStabilization efforts and peacekeeping operations are \r\nan eloquent testimony to this. We must accompany this \r\nprocess by strengthening the prerogatives of the \r\nSecretary-General in the area of preventive diplomacy \r\nto prevent minor conflicts from becoming larger, open \r\nconflicts. In this respect, conflict prevention can be \r\neffective only if we take into account the nagging \r\nquestion of the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons, which is a dangerous, destabilizing factor. \r\n We would like to launch a vibrant appeal to the \r\ncountries that produce small arms and light weapons to \r\nadopt responsible export policies that would truly help \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 34 \r\n \r\nto curb illicit flows of these weapons. The same applies \r\nto the question of disarmament, which our country \r\nconsiders crucial if we want a rapid return to security, \r\npeace and development. We say this from experience, \r\nbecause in Burundi, the proliferation of small arms and \r\nlight weapons, as well as in other countries of the \r\nGreat Lakes region, continue to cause destruction in \r\nterms of human lives and social and economic \r\ninfrastructure, and it always un-does any reconstruction \r\nand development effort that we are trying to achieve. \r\n International terrorism is another major challenge \r\nto global peace and security. This phenomenon can be \r\nseen on all continents, thus proving very clearly that \r\nterrorism knows no borders. The absence of a suitable \r\nand effective strategy to eliminate this scourge places \r\nus at its mercy. These situations should be one of the \r\ntop challenges for the United Nations family. Our \r\nOrganization, therefore, must be a tool at everyone’s \r\nservice in all countries, a tool capable of raising hopes, \r\nof dispelling concerns and of restoring respect for the \r\nrule of international law. \r\n In this context, we must all agree and decide to \r\nmake our Organization more operational, more \r\npragmatic, more democratic and capable of fulfilling \r\nits mission, a mission that is to be accomplished in full \r\ncooperation with the regional organizations whose \r\neffectiveness in the area of conflict prevention and \r\nintervention is well known, despite often insufficient \r\nresources. Thus, we express the hope that Security \r\nCouncil reform, which has long been advocated and \r\ndiscussed, will finally become a reality, with a \r\ncomposition that respects the representation of \r\ncontinents that, until now, have been excluded from the \r\ncategory of permanent members, such as Africa, our \r\ncontinent. \r\n Although the cold war is over, we are forced to \r\nacknowledge that social relations have crystallized into \r\ntwo blocs with almost antagonistic and diverging \r\ninterests — that is to say, the rich on one side and the \r\npoor on the other. It is high time to humanize relations \r\nbetween the two blocs and to encourage specific \r\nmeasures through respect for commitments that have \r\nbeen taken. Otherwise, we will see the continuation of \r\nnew societal phenomena, such as the brain drain, \r\nworsening crime, sex industry and international \r\nmigratory pressure, which stir up passions and spark \r\ncontroversy. \r\n To conclude, Sir, the gathering of such a large \r\nnumber of high-level officials makes it possible to take \r\nthe pulse of the political situation as well as of the \r\ninternational social and economic situation. It makes it \r\npossible for us to observe our weaknesses and our \r\npotential. We believe that solutions to the different \r\nproblems that have been mentioned in the course of \r\nthis debate are always possible, as long as there is a \r\nminimum of political will. It is that minimum, which is \r\nrequired of every member of our Organization, that we \r\nshould all try to obtain together. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Martin Nduwimana, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Nyumah Boakai,  \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Liberia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Liberia. \r\n Mr. Joseph Nyumah Boakai, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Joseph Nyumah \r\nBoakai, Vice-President of the Republic of Liberia, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Boakai (Liberia): I congratulate the \r\ndelegation, Government and the people of the Republic \r\nof Macedonia on Mr. Srgjan Kerim’s election as \r\nPresident of the sixty-second session of the United \r\nNations General Assembly. On behalf of my \r\nGovernment, I acknowledge the astute diplomatic \r\nskills and wisdom that he brings to this important \r\nassignment. May he rest assured of my delegation’s \r\nsupport in his endeavours. \r\n Similarly, it gives me great pleasure to \r\ncongratulate our new Secretary-General, Mr. Ban  \r\nKi-moon, of the Republic of Korea, on his election as \r\nSecretary-General of this Organization. It is the belief \r\nof my Government that the United Nations will greatly \r\nbenefit from his wealth of experience as a seasoned \r\ndiplomat and statesman. \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n35 07-51962 \r\n \r\n Nearly two years ago, Liberia held its first post-\r\nconflict elections, following more than 14 years of \r\ncivil war. We were strongly supported by the United \r\nNations, the African Union, the Economic Community \r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and members of the \r\ninternational community, including the United States, \r\nthe European Union, the People’s Republic of China \r\nand Japan. We commend you for your continued \r\nsupport toward our national reconstruction \r\nprogrammes. \r\n My Government welcomes and highly appreciates \r\nthe recent decision of the Security Council to lift the \r\nsanctions which it saw fit to impose on the timber and \r\ndiamond sectors in Liberia. We pledge our fullest \r\ncooperation with the United Nations as it partners our \r\ncountry’s reform, which undoubtedly will strengthen \r\nthe good governance procedures. Although the \r\nimposition of sanctions was considered by many as \r\npunitive, I am gratified to inform you that the Liberian \r\npeople viewed the sanctions as prudent and corrective. \r\nThe sanctions helped to accelerate the adoption of new \r\nlaws and the institutionalization of appropriate \r\nmechanisms to ensure that we would never again allow \r\nconditions such as those that gave rise to their \r\nimposition. \r\n We also thank the international community for its \r\ncontinued support to peacebuilding and the \r\nstrengthening of instruments of security and stability in \r\nLiberia. In spite of the gains of peace, Liberia remains \r\nfragile. The recent decision by the Security Council to \r\nextend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in \r\nLiberia (UNMIL) is timely and relevant. Liberia \r\nremains grateful for that and other decisions aimed at \r\nsustaining peace and stability in the country. \r\n Democracy is on an irreversible course in Africa. \r\nThe values of democratic governance and the rule of \r\nlaw are also on an upward march. My Government \r\nnotes with great delight the successful holding of \r\nrelatively peaceful, free, fair and democratic elections \r\nin Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Mauritania and Mali. From \r\nour experience in Liberia, we know that democratic \r\nelections in themselves do not provide quick answers \r\nto the monumental problems and challenges that face a \r\nnew and emerging post-conflict nation. They do, \r\nhowever, create the environment, and potentially \r\nunleash opportunities, for freedom and individual \r\nenterprise to thrive and prosper. Because such \r\ndemocracies are in their infancy, they need the support \r\nof bilateral and multilateral partners. We therefore call \r\non the United Nations, the African Union and bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners to support all new \r\ndemocracies and to help us meet the multifaceted needs \r\nof our people. \r\n Liberia reaffirms its belief in the United Nations \r\nas the best institution for the promotion and protection \r\nof international peace and security and the resolution \r\nof crises around our world. Our faith in the United \r\nNations is rooted in our conviction that it represents \r\nmankind’s best hope and vehicle for the advancement \r\nof the common purpose of humanity. \r\n Our generation must avoid the temptation to use \r\nthe instruments of our common Organization for \r\nnarrow agendas that undermine its Charter. In this new \r\nmillennium, the United Nations must continue to renew \r\nits resolve to promote, protect and sustain the universal \r\nvirtues of liberty, equality, solidarity, tolerance and \r\nnon-violence, while simultaneously respecting and \r\nprotecting our environment, pursuant to the mandate of \r\nthe Millennium Summit. Liberia commits itself to \r\nbeing a strong partner and advocate for the promotion \r\nof these shared values of our common humanity. But as \r\nthe United Nations pursues those objectives, we must \r\nrecognize that it cannot expect to succeed using \r\nframeworks that are nearly three quarters of a century \r\nold. The United Nations needs to be, and must be, \r\nreformed.  \r\n Liberia and other Member States have advanced \r\npractical suggestions for the reform agenda. Liberia \r\noffers the following proposals: first, a timely review \r\nand reconfiguration of the Security Council, including \r\nthe current decision-making machinery and processes \r\nof the Organization, should be conducted to make it \r\nmore relevant and representative of the world \r\ncommunity; secondly, mechanisms should be put in \r\nplace to ensure that the Charter remains inviolate; and, \r\nthirdly, careful consideration should be given to due \r\nprocess in dealing with Member States. \r\n Pursuant to our call for reform of the United \r\nNations, we today call on Member States to give \r\nmeaning and expression to gender equality. We propose \r\nthat the United Nations recommit itself to ensuring an \r\nequitable partnership of women and men in the \r\nleadership of the Organization. Reforming the United \r\nNations also means reforming our attitude towards \r\nwomen and other minority groups worldwide. There is \r\nno doubt in our mind that women will significantly \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 36 \r\n \r\ncontribute to the process of change in this \r\nOrganization. \r\n Fully cognizant of the evidence that the dividends \r\nof peace and security are always greater than the \r\ndebilitating effects of conflict, Liberia continues to \r\nwork within the regional framework of the Mano River \r\nUnion, the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS), and the African Union to ensure the \r\nrealization and advancement of peace in the subregion \r\nand on the African continent. It is said in my country \r\nthat there is no capitalism without capital. Peace is \r\nsustained only with the economic empowerment of all \r\npeople. \r\n In that regard, since its inauguration our \r\nGovernment has engaged in active subregional \r\ninitiatives to improve and strengthen ties of friendship \r\nand economic cooperation with our immediate \r\nneighbours in the Mano River Basin and the ECOWAS \r\nCommunity. As a result of our efforts, the instruments \r\nof peace and security and the potential of trade \r\nrationalization in our subregion are stronger today than \r\nthey ever were a few years ago. Under the \r\nchairmanship of Her Excellency President Ellen \r\nJohnson-Sirleaf, the Mano River Union has assumed a \r\nnew vibrancy and renewed sense of cohesion and \r\ncommon purpose. Citizens of the Mano River Union \r\ncountries are exchanging more frequent visits, and \r\nundertaking programmes aimed at enhancing \r\nintegration and peace. That is why we were happy to \r\nhost President Ernest Bai Koroma a few days following \r\nhis inauguration as President of Sierra Leone. \r\n As events in the Middle East continue to claim \r\nour attention in the world community, we must not lose \r\nsight of similarly grave situations in Africa. I refer to \r\nthe continuous humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur in \r\nthe Sudan, and crises in Somalia, Guinea-Bissau, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Chad, Burundi, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \r\nRepublic and Uganda, among others. My Government \r\ntherefore welcomes Security Council resolution 1769 \r\n(2007) and the consensus reached for the deployment \r\nof a hybrid African Union-United Nations force in \r\nDarfur following months of painstaking negotiations. \r\nWe further urge countries that have pledged logistical \r\nand other support to fulfil their promises to ensure the \r\ntimely deployment of the peacekeeping force in Darfur. \r\nWe applaud the progress made in the resolution of the \r\ncrisis in our sisterly Republic of Côte d’Ivoire. My \r\ndelegation calls for strong support of the Ouagadougou \r\nagreement, which provides the best possible framework \r\nfor peace, security and stability in that country. Peace \r\nand security in Cote d’Ivoire means peace and security \r\nin Liberia, and indeed, in the Mano River Basin and \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States. \r\n The world has witnessed and continues to witness \r\nphenomenal advances in science and technology \r\nleading to the transformation of industrialization and \r\nthe improvement of the human condition. We must \r\nwork to save our planet, because, when we save our \r\ncommon Earth, we assure the survival of all of its \r\ninhabitants. \r\n Liberia supports the efforts of the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development, the Kyoto Protocol, the \r\ndecision reached on Agenda 21 at the 1992 Rio \r\nConference and the recent high-profile conference \r\nhosted here on climate change, intended to raise \r\ninternational awareness of the degradation of the \r\nenvironment and the need for collaborative efforts to \r\nreverse negative trends. There could be no theme more \r\nappropriate and timely for this year’s general debate \r\nthan the theme “Responding to Climate Change”.  \r\n This debate will, we are confident, accentuate the \r\nissues of environment and stimulate increased \r\ninternational action. Liberia is concerned about the \r\nrapid degradation of the climate. We hope that this \r\nsession will produce a consensus on how to save \r\nsucceeding generations from the impact of \r\ndeteriorating climate.  \r\n In our world today, there is a correlation between \r\nwar, civil conflict and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic targets and destroys our human \r\ncapital, the backbone of our socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. The records of the United Nations and \r\nother organizations show that the prevalence of \r\nHIV/AIDS increases in countries affected by war and \r\ncivil conflicts, owing to the mass movement of \r\npopulations. Post-conflict countries therefore need \r\nspecial attention if the scourge of HIV/AIDS is to be \r\novercome.  The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and other diseases has contributed significantly \r\nin retarding the progress of the developing nations.  \r\n African nations must develop the political will to \r\ncombat the health crisis on our continent. To this end, \r\nwe call upon our partners in the developed world to \r\ntreat the issue of antiretroviral drugs as a purely social \r\nand humanitarian matter of an emergency nature, \r\noutside of politics. Liberia recently set up its National \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n37 07-51962 \r\n \r\nAIDS Commission to advance practical strategies that \r\nwill help to halt the spread of this deadly disease. We \r\nare hopeful that prudent action, including a change of \r\nlife styles coupled with antiviral drugs, will help \r\naddress this emerging catastrophe.  \r\n Liberia continues to be burdened by huge debts \r\nowed to bilateral and multilateral creditors. Servicing \r\nthese debts remains a major priority of the Government \r\nof Liberia. However, our capacity to make payment is \r\nconstrained owing to the severe resource challenges \r\narising out of a 14-year civil war. There is a traditional \r\nparable in my country which says that you cannot dig a \r\nhole to fill a hole. We renew our Government’s plea for \r\ninternational empathy and favourable consideration of \r\nour debt cancellation request. \r\n We reassure all of our bilateral and multilateral \r\ncreditors of our commitment to continue to work with \r\nthem to develop the necessary framework toward the \r\nactualization of Liberia’s debt relief initiatives. \r\n We also thank all our partners, especially the \r\nUnited States, Great Britain, China and Germany \r\namong others, for active steps taken toward debt relief \r\nfor Liberia.  \r\n I assure you that after learning a costly lesson in \r\nviolence, the people of Liberia are determined to settle \r\ntheir differences through peaceful means. With your \r\nsupport, we have found a better way to resolve our \r\ndifferences. We have resolved to forgive one another, \r\npick up our dignity and pride and move forward in \r\nunity and oneness of purpose with strong determination \r\nto work for a better and brighter future. Our unity in \r\nfostering the faith of our founding fathers to build a \r\nnation dedicated to freedom, liberty and justice for all \r\nremains undaunted. \r\n We are confident that our international partners \r\nwant to see a success story in Liberia. Let me assure \r\nthis Assembly that nobody wants that more than \r\nLiberians themselves! May the Almighty God bless us, \r\nprotect our sovereignties, unify us, preserve our \r\ndignities and keep us safe. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Joseph Nyumah Boakai, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Isatou Njie-Saidy, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of the Gambia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof the Gambia. \r\n Mrs. Isatou Njie-Saidy, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.  \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Mrs. Isatou Njie-Saidy, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of the Gambia, and \r\ninviting her to address the General Assembly.  \r\n Mrs. Njie-Saidy (Gambia): Let me at the outset \r\ncongratulate the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly and to reassure \r\nhim of the Gambia’s full support and cooperation \r\nduring his tenure in office. Let me also use this \r\nopportunity to express our appreciation of the excellent \r\nmanner in which the outgoing President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa managed the \r\naffairs of the Assembly at its sixty-first session. \r\n My delegation would also like to use this \r\nopportunity to once more congratulate our new \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his \r\nassumption of the leadership of the United Nations. \r\nThe Gambia is particularly delighted that Mr. Ban had \r\nthe opportunity to address the Summit of Heads of \r\nState and Government of the African Union during his \r\nmeeting in Banjul in July 2006. His subsequent \r\nelection, surely can only be a source of pride and \r\ndelight for us. \r\n We also wish to commend him for the initiative \r\nhe took to convene a high-level event several days ago \r\non a subject that is of great concern to all nations and \r\npeoples of the world, namely, climate change. All the \r\nsalient issues surrounding this phenomenon have been \r\nbrought to the fore. It is now our fervent hope that \r\naction will be taken to address them in a most timely \r\nmanner.  \r\n The mid-term review of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration two years ago indicated that the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) are far from \r\nbeing attained in most of the developing world. This \r\nnotwithstanding, our commitment to the MDGs is \r\nunwavering. The overarching policy objective of the \r\nGovernment, under the leadership of the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Gambia Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 38 \r\n \r\nJammeh, is to reduce poverty and achieve all the \r\nMDGs. We have just concluded a second Poverty \r\nReduction Strategy Paper, which clearly sets out our \r\npolicy framework for achieving growth and poverty \r\nreduction, despite our meagre resources and \r\nendowments and despite the failure of several partners \r\nto fulfil their pledges of aid, debt relief and market \r\naccess for African countries. The same mid-term \r\nreviews also showed that the commitments that were \r\nmade in many forums by the international community \r\nin support of the MDGs in poor countries have not \r\ntranslated into real resource flows into these countries.  \r\n We therefore call on the international community \r\nto rededicate itself to the provisions of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Paris Declaration on Aid \r\nEffectiveness. In this regard, my delegation welcomes \r\nthe panel of eminent personalities established by the \r\nformer British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, to \r\nmonitor pledges made at summits of the Group of \r\nEight, including those made at Gleneagles. My \r\ndelegation considers it particularly critical to take \r\naction to reverse the downward trend in overseas \r\ndevelopment assistance. \r\n We also need to re-examine the framework of key \r\nrules that govern, inter alia, international trade and \r\nfinance, global competition, foreign direct investment \r\nand international migration. It is important that bodies \r\nmaking rules in those areas accommodate the views of \r\ndeveloping countries in general, and least developed \r\ncountries in particular. For Africa, where we must of \r\nnecessity move away from aid dependency, the \r\ndevelopment of the continent must be addressed from \r\nthe crucial vantage point of trade and market access, so \r\nas to enable our economies to be advantageously \r\npositioned in order for us to begin enjoying the fruits \r\nof globalization. \r\n My delegation would like to seize this \r\nopportunity to request the Assembly to pause for a \r\nmoment and reflect on the plight of the poor the world \r\nover. Poverty anywhere, we will all agree, is indeed a \r\nproblem everywhere. And it is worth remembering that \r\nthe plight of the poor can affect the comfort and \r\nsecurity of the more privileged and affluent members \r\nof human society. There is no doubt that poverty \r\nengenders many economic, social and political \r\nproblems. It negatively affects global health and is a \r\nthreat to international peace and security as well. \r\n Therefore, the need for greater international \r\nsolidarity to fight poverty in all its forms and \r\nramifications cannot be overemphasized. The \r\ndevelopment efforts of most Governments, particularly \r\nthose in Africa, continue to be undermined by the \r\nscourges of malaria, HIV/AIDS and other health \r\nrelated issues, such as hunger and malnutrition. I must \r\nthank our true friends and development partners for the \r\nexcellent support they are providing to the Gambian \r\npeople, particularly in the areas of health, education, \r\nand agriculture. It is my fervent hope that the \r\ninternational community will live up to its commitment \r\nto support the efforts of our Government as we strive \r\nto improve the well-being of our people. In order to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, \r\nwhich we should all consider to be a necessary \r\ncondition to affect people’s living standards, Africa \r\nsorely needs significant investments in health, \r\neducation, agriculture and infrastructure. \r\n Allow me to turn to peace and security in the \r\nworld, especially on our continent of Africa. In recent \r\nyears, we have witnessed significant improvements in \r\nmost of the continent. In West Africa, for example, we \r\nhave been consolidating peace and deepening the \r\ndemocratization process as well.  \r\n The people of Sierra Leone have just gone \r\nthrough a peaceful, free and fair presidential election. \r\nMy delegation would like to congratulate them and to \r\nwish the new Government all the success in its efforts \r\nto follow the path of rapid socio-economic \r\ndevelopment for the Sierra Leonean people. The return \r\nof peace to Côte d’Ivoire is a welcome and a vital \r\ndevelopment not only for the country and its people, \r\nbut also for the entire West Africa subregion. The \r\nGovernment of the Gambia fully welcomes the Ivorian \r\nGovernment’s commitment to organize presidential \r\nelections shortly, and we wish the friendly people of \r\nthat great country every success. \r\n The situation in Somalia requires the urgent \r\nresponse of the international community. Lasting \r\npeace, stability, and reconciliation can return to that \r\ncountry only when the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment is empowered to establish law and order. \r\nThe United Nations, as the overall guardian of \r\ninternational peace and security, should support the \r\nefforts of the African Union (AU) in that regard, and \r\nSomalia’s neighbours as well, to rally the various \r\nfactions together and bring lasting peace to that \r\ncountry. \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n39 07-51962 \r\n \r\n As we gather here, thousands of innocent \r\ncivilians, including women and children, continue to be \r\nvictimized by the fratricidal conflict in the Sudanese \r\nregion of Darfur. My Government therefore welcomes \r\nthe commitment of the international community to \r\nreplace the existing African Union Mission in Sudan \r\n(AMIS) with a hybrid United Nations-African Union \r\nmission, invested, of course, this time around, with a \r\nmore active mandate to keep and enforce peace in \r\nDarfur. We in the Gambia have been in the forefront in \r\nthe African Union’s peace efforts in Darfur, and we \r\nwill certainly continue to support the international \r\neffort with a substantial contribution of Gambian \r\ntroops to serve in the new arrangement. At this \r\njuncture, let me salute the Sudanese Government for \r\ntheir cooperation and their manifest willingness to find \r\na lasting solution through a political process. \r\n The peace and security situation of the Great \r\nLakes region remains a major concern. While we \r\nwelcome the successful elections in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo last year, we recognize the \r\nfragility and precarious nature of peace in that country \r\nand the region as a whole. My delegation therefore \r\ncalls on the international community to continue to \r\nwork to search for ways of achieving durable peace. \r\nWe also urge the international community to assist in \r\nbringing all the parties to the negotiation table and to \r\nmove vigorously to address the humanitarian situation. \r\n Just as the security and peace situation in Africa \r\npreoccupies my delegation, so also do the conflicts and \r\nturmoil in the rest of the world, especially in Iraq, \r\nAfghanistan and Palestine. The conflict in Iraq remains \r\na major source of concern, not least because it now \r\nthreatens the peace and security of the entire Middle \r\nEastern region, if not the whole world. Within Iraq \r\nitself, the conflict has brought untold suffering to the \r\ncivilian population especially women and children. \r\nFurthermore, the alarming rate of civilian deaths \r\ncannot be justified.  \r\n Also, the resultant large volume of refugee \r\noutflows has now placed unbearable pressure on the \r\neconomies of, in particular, the neighbouring countries. \r\nWhile we recognize, of course, the potential of \r\nrefugees to make positive contributions to the \r\neconomies and societies of their host countries, refugee \r\noutflows of the magnitude that we are seeing in Iraq \r\ncan only pose a threat to social and political security. \r\nWe therefore strongly urge that as a matter of urgency, \r\nalternatives be found in order to resolve the conflict in \r\nthat country. \r\n A new approach to the situation in Afghanistan is \r\nalso long overdue. The country needs more political \r\ndialogue than military engagement. We also wish to see \r\nleaders in the region engage each other in meaningful \r\ndialogue and, of course, renew their commitment to \r\ngood-neighbourliness as well. \r\n The unresolved question of the self-determination \r\nof the Palestinian people remains the most important \r\npolitical and moral question of our time. A few years \r\nago, we all placed our faith in the so-called Road Map \r\nfor peace and hoped that the Quartet would bring about \r\nthe eagerly awaited two-state solution.  \r\n My delegation now very much welcomes the new \r\ninitiative being led by the United States of America and \r\nvery much looks forward to the convening of a \r\nconference that would once and for all settle this \r\nfestering imbroglio. We urge all concerned to come to \r\nthe table in good faith and with a strong will to make a \r\npositive contribution to the search for a lasting solution \r\nto the problems of peace and security in the Middle \r\nEast and, indeed, in the peace process throughout the \r\nworld. \r\n Allow me to highlight some issues relating to \r\ninternational justice. The illegal, outrageous and \r\nprotracted embargo imposed on the friendly Republic \r\nof Cuba has no basis. It is devoid of political and \r\ncommercial sense, and those who impose the embargo \r\nshould join our ranks in the international community in \r\nrejecting the embargo as a colossal error of judgement \r\nthat should never have happened in the first place. We \r\nhope to see a repeal of all laws, measures and policies \r\nin that direction. \r\n The Gambian delegation sincerely hopes as well \r\nthat the international community will reflect deeply on \r\nthe dangers posed by the increasing and unprovoked \r\nmilitarization of the Taiwan Strait. Regional and, \r\nultimately, international stability are under threat from \r\nthe build-up of thousands of military warheads for use \r\nin attacks on Taiwan. The problem of the Taiwan Strait \r\nis one that is very serious indeed, and which calls for \r\nurgent action by the international community. The \r\nUnited Nations should not wait until it is too late to \r\naddress the situation of the Strait and its growing \r\nmilitarization.  \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 40 \r\n \r\n We, the Members of the United Nations, have at \r\nthis juncture abdicated our responsibilities towards \r\nTaiwan by refusing it full membership in the \r\nOrganization. The legitimate aspirations of the people \r\nof that dynamic, technologically developed, advanced \r\neconomic powerhouse ought to be fulfilled by States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. Let me seize this \r\nopportunity to assure the Assembly that my delegation \r\nis not acting against the interest of any Member State. \r\nRather, we speak out in the interest of peace across the \r\nTaiwan Strait, peace throughout the Asia-Pacific region \r\nand, indeed, peace in the whole world. It is in that \r\nspirit that my delegation will continue to call on the \r\nGeneral Assembly to address this threat to international \r\npeace and security. \r\n  Mr. Beck (Palau), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n Let me conclude by putting on record the \r\nGambia’s frustration with the stalled reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. As former Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan said when the proposals were first made, two \r\nyears ago, no reform of the United Nations can be \r\ncomplete without reform of the Security Council. For \r\nus in Africa, it is just unacceptable that a body that \r\ndecides on life and death issues for millions of \r\nAfricans includes no African country at all as a \r\npermanent member. That is why the Gambia continues \r\nto strongly endorse the Ezulwini Consensus, which \r\nrepresents Africa’s common position on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n At a time when we are all committed to good \r\ngovernance at the national level, we surely cannot \r\nignore good governance at the international level. The \r\nproposed reform of the United Nations, especially as \r\nregards the Security Council, must be seen within that \r\ncontext. \r\n I wish us all a very successful session. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Ms. Isatou Njie-Saidy, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Elias Camsek Chin, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Palau \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Palau. \r\n  Mr. Elias Camsek Chin, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have the very great \r\npleasure of welcoming His Excellency Mr. Elias \r\nCamsek Chin, Vice-President of the Republic of Palau, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Chin (Palau): On behalf of the President of \r\nPalau, Tommy E. Remengesau, Jr., and the people of \r\nPalau, let me begin by offering my congratulations to \r\nthe General Assembly President on his election and \r\nassuring him of our cooperation in the coming year. We \r\nexpress our appreciation to the Group of Asian States \r\nand the General Assembly for the confidence they have \r\ndemonstrated by electing a representative of Palau as a \r\nVice-President. Palau is the smallest country in the \r\nhistory of the United Nations to have this honour, and \r\nwe take it very seriously. \r\n Palau congratulates the Secretary-General on his \r\nleadership on stopping the genocide in Darfur. We were \r\nmoved by the calls for immediate action that we heard \r\nfrom President Bush and others here at the United \r\nNations. In this respect, I wish to announce that Palau \r\nwill send peacekeepers to Darfur and will play our part \r\nin this critical demonstration of international concern. \r\n Despite our capacity issues, this will not be \r\nPalau’s first peacekeeping deployment. But while we \r\nare a responsible and proud Member of the United \r\nNations, we note the continuing lack of a permanent \r\nUnited Nations presence in Palau. Last June, the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United \r\nNations Population Fund and UNICEF announced that \r\neight new joint offices would open in Pacific island \r\ncountries, including Palau. We welcomed that historic \r\naccomplishment, but we are concerned at the fact that \r\nthe offices have yet to open. Existing mechanisms \r\nappear to have blocked progress on the ground. But we \r\nbelieve that the original goals and intentions of the \r\nproject can be salvaged if there is a will to respond to \r\nthe needs of small island nations like Palau. We would \r\nwelcome the intervention and assistance of our \r\npartners, as well as the recommitment of the Secretariat \r\nto our original shared goals. \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n41 07-51962 \r\n \r\n We note the President’s call to ensure that the \r\nUnited Nations as an organization and we as Member \r\nStates are properly prepared to confront terrorism. \r\nPalau has worked to improve its anti-terrorism \r\ncapacity. We have also met with the Counter-Terrorism \r\nCommittee Executive Directorate to advance our \r\nrequests for assistance, particularly in the area of \r\ncombating money-laundering and terrorism financing. \r\nUnfortunately, the efforts of the Directorate have been \r\ninsufficient. Our hope is that during the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly, the United Nations \r\nwill be able to help small countries in addressing this \r\nthreat and in meeting our Security Council obligations. \r\n The Pacific is home to some of the world’s \r\nlargest and most important biodiversity hotspots. Our \r\nocean ecosystems provide the backbone for Palau’s \r\nexistence, and we are committed to their preservation. \r\nLast year, our nations banded together to protect \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems from deep-sea bottom \r\ntrawling, a destructive fishing practice responsible for \r\n95 per cent of worldwide damage to seamounts. As a \r\nresult, the South Pacific Regional Fisheries \r\nManagement Organization adopted interim measures \r\nthat took a substantial step towards eliminating this \r\nunsustainable practice. We encourage all other regional \r\nfisheries management organizations and flag States to \r\nfollow this example, and we remind them of the \r\ndeadlines to take action. \r\n Palau has been vocal in its crusade to end bottom \r\ntrawling because of its effects on ocean ecosystems. \r\nThe North Pacific is home to some of the world’s best \r\nfisheries. Their diversity is the key reason for the \r\nMicronesia Challenge, an initiative launched by \r\nPresident Remengesau, whereby countries and \r\nterritories of Micronesia have joined together to \r\nconserve 30 per cent of near-shore marine resources \r\nand 20 per cent of land resources by the year 2020. \r\nThis project is the first of its kind in the world. It \r\ncovers 6.7 million square miles of ocean, and it will \r\nhelp protect 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs, \r\nincluding more than 60 threatened species. \r\n While eliminating bottom trawling and \r\nestablishing protected areas are certainly important \r\nactions, they will be fruitless if rapid progress on \r\nclimate change cannot be made at the international \r\nlevel. We are no longer in total control of our destiny. \r\nWhen temperatures increase, our corals bleach, the \r\nseas rise and the oceans acidify, threatening to \r\ndemolish our marine biodiversity, jeopardizing our \r\nlivelihoods and eventually destroying our identity. \r\n In the light of the high vulnerability of small \r\nisland developing States to the impact of climate \r\nchange, we stress the absolute need to reach an \r\nagreement on a set of quantified emission reduction \r\ntargets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto \r\nProtocol. These emission reduction targets must be \r\nambitious, must reflect the urgency of our collective \r\ncircumstances and must be consistent with a mitigation \r\nframework that protects the most vulnerable parties to \r\nthe Convention, in both the short and the long-term. It \r\nis imperative that the effectiveness of the post-2012 \r\nregime address the issue of mitigating the impacts of \r\nclimate change on small island developing States, as \r\nthe key benchmark of its adequacy and effectiveness.  \r\n We note too the ongoing debate on General \r\nAssembly reform and join our voices with others who \r\nnote the need for concrete results on Security Council \r\nreform. Without Security Council reform, there can be \r\nno genuine United Nations reform. The early \r\nconclusion of the discussion is essential. Japan has \r\ndemonstrated its concern for and commitment to the \r\nPacific and the international community. It should be a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council. That is \r\ntrue too of India, the largest democracy among \r\ndeveloping nations, whose contributions to global \r\nsecurity have earned it the right to a permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council. We have supported and continue \r\nto support the draft resolution of the Group of Four and \r\nhope that the Assembly will address the resolution this \r\nyear. \r\n We also note our disappointment that Taiwan \r\ncontinues to be excluded from this Hall. The world \r\nwould benefit from Taiwan’s membership in the United \r\nNations and other international institutions. We were \r\ndisappointed that the Secretary-General failed to \r\nfollow the Charter and the rules of the Security Council \r\nby refusing to transmit and circulate Taiwan’s \r\nmembership application to the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly. Ultimately, legitimate \r\ndemocracies must be recognized and supported across \r\nthe breadth of our planet no matter how large or small \r\nthe country. \r\n On behalf of Palau, a small and peaceful island \r\nnation in the wide Pacific Ocean, let me thank all of \r\nyou in my country’s native language: Kom Kmal \r\nMesulang. \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 42 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau for the statement he has just made. \r\n  His Excellency Mr. Elias Camsek Chin, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Zarifou Ayeva, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and African Integration of Togo. \r\n Mr. Ayeva (Togo) (spoke in French): Each \r\nsession of the General Assembly offers us an \r\nopportunity to meet in order to take stock of our \r\nactions and define the necessary perspectives for \r\nbreathing new life into our Organization. In analysing \r\nevents throughout the world during the past year, we \r\nshould note that despite the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity the situation is far from satisfactory. \r\nIndeed, international peace and security are still \r\nseriously threatened due to persistent conflicts — in \r\nparticular in Africa, the Middle East and Iraq — while \r\nthe risks of terrorist aggression are far from being \r\neliminated.  \r\n In economic terms, the situation — \r\novershadowed by extreme poverty and endemic \r\ndiseases continues to be a source of serious concern for \r\nthe majority of the countries of the planet who are \r\nconsidered to be the poorest. Likewise, natural \r\ndisasters caused by climate change are a constant \r\nchallenge to the human conscience, to the point of \r\nwondering whether the international community will \r\nbe able to find appropriate and lasting solutions. \r\n The state of our world today should inspire us to \r\nredouble our efforts in order to give real meaning to \r\ninternational solidarity. It should above all incite the \r\ninternational community and Member States \r\ncollectively and individually to seek with \r\ndetermination ways and means not only to ensure the \r\nprosperity of their national populations but also to \r\nreduce, at least somewhat, extreme poverty in the \r\nworld. \r\n Before continuing my speech, I wish to add my \r\nvoice to those of previous speakers and to express my \r\nwarm congratulations to the President on his election \r\nto the presidency of the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. He may count on the support of \r\nTogo in discharging his high functions throughout the \r\nterm, which I hope will be fruitful. I wish to once again \r\nexpress my congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\noutstanding election to the post of Secretary-General of \r\nour Organization. I am certain his great wealth of \r\ndiplomatic experience will make it possible for the \r\nUnited Nations to strengthen its actions in order to \r\nachieve a fairer and more democratic world in which \r\neach country will be able to exist in freedom. \r\n With regard to Togo, after several years of the \r\ndemocratization process which unfortunately has not \r\nbeen smooth, the country today is now moving beyond \r\nthe lack of understanding and intolerance among its \r\nsons and daughters. To consolidate our achievements \r\nwe have endeavoured to find appropriate solutions for \r\nthe concerns of the people by implementing a policy on \r\nnational reconstruction which will value all Togolese \r\nwithout exclusion. Aware that the peace and economic \r\ndevelopment that we want for our country cannot be \r\nachieved without the effective participation of the \r\npopulation in managing public affairs, we have spared \r\nno effort to involve the Togolese political class in a \r\nnational dialogue in order to overcome their bitterness, \r\nto restore confidence and to devote our energies to \r\nnational construction. That ambition is possible only if \r\nwe strive to strengthen Togolese democracy each \r\nday — a democracy based upon an integral multiparty \r\nsystem and a State based on democratic law. \r\n Very soon, on 14 October 2007, Togolese \r\ndemocracy will become consolidated with the election \r\nof deputies to the National Assembly, an assembly \r\nwithin which we dare to hope that most of the political \r\nforces within the country will be represented. Those \r\nupcoming legislative elections, whose successful \r\noutcomes will be possible — thanks not only to the \r\npolitical maturity of the Togolese people — but also to \r\nthe support throughout the electoral process of friendly \r\ncountries and international institutions; its resulting \r\nselection is an inevitable event and will be a decisive \r\nturning point in the history of Togo. \r\n The Togolese Government in turn will spare no \r\neffort, nor will it skimp on expenses, to ensure that the \r\nelections take place in strict transparency and the will \r\nof the people as expressed by the ballot box is fully \r\nrespected. With that goal in mind, the population will, \r\nfor the first time, vote with secure voter cards with \r\nphotographs and the whole system will be supported by \r\na reliable electoral roll. Our greatest hope is that those \r\nelections will give an opportunity to the people of Togo \r\nto reconcile and an opportunity for the country to \r\nresume its place within the family of nations. \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n43 07-51962 \r\n \r\n For that reason, I wish to take the opportunity \r\nnow to repeat my Government’s gratitude to the \r\ninternational community — in particular the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States, the African Union, \r\nthe countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, \r\nthe European Union, the International Organization of \r\nla Francophonie, France, Germany, the People’s \r\nRepublic of China, the United States and all the other \r\nStates — for the unwavering support which they \r\ncontinue to give to Togo throughout these crucial \r\ntimes.  \r\n Of course, we cannot forget the United Nations, \r\nwhich, through the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP), has played an essential role since \r\nthe start of our democratic process, and more \r\nspecifically, in the preparation for these elections. \r\nThese elections, which are to be held on 14 October, \r\nare due to a great extent on the facilitator chosen \r\nunanimously by the political forces — I appointed \r\nBlaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso and \r\ncurrent Chairman of the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS).  \r\n Establishment of the rule of law requires \r\ndignified and loyal conduct from its citizens based on \r\nthe respect of the noble ideals that underpin the \r\nRepublic and promote progress in society. It also \r\nrequires bold measures from leaders aimed at \r\npromoting national peace and harmony. \r\n In this respect and to take into account \r\ncommitments undertaken through the Global Political \r\nAgreement, our Togolese Government is determined to \r\nestablish in the near future the two Commissions \r\nprovided for under the Agreement, namely, the \r\nCommission to Investigate Acts of Political Violence \r\nCommitted in the Past and to Study Methods for \r\nCompensation for Victims and the Commission to \r\nPropose Measures to Promote Forgiveness and \r\nNational Reconciliation. The Constitutional Court, one \r\nof whose missions is to deal with electoral disputes, \r\nwas set up on 20 September after its reconstitution in \r\naccordance with the wish of the political class as \r\nexpressed during the national dialogue. \r\n These measures, together with all the other \r\nactions that the Government carries out every day, are \r\npart of our will to ban political violence and combat \r\nimpunity, in all sincerity, pragmatism and discernment. \r\n A national programme to combat impunity has \r\nalready been set up and the first awareness activities \r\nhave been carried out with success throughout the \r\ncountry over a period of a month and a half. This \r\nprogramme, which is aimed at helping to develop \r\nconditions conducive to the birth of a democratic spirit, \r\nis supported by the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights created in Togo, and \r\nwe are pleased to express our appreciation of its \r\nefficient role in strengthening governmental action. \r\n The problems of peace, security and the building \r\nof a democratic State based on the rule of law and the \r\nsustainable development of Togo can only be grasped \r\nby taking into account the economic realities of the \r\ncountry. Indeed, the Togolese economy has suffered a \r\ngreat deal from disruption of external assistance from \r\nits traditional partners since 1993. This absence of \r\nexternal assistance has certainly had a negative impact \r\non social programmes and development programmes \r\ndesigned by the Government and has seriously eroded \r\npublic infrastructure and has delayed measures aimed \r\nat good economic governance. This situation has \r\nslowed the efforts of the Government to improve the \r\nliving conditions of the Togolese, more than 60 per \r\ncent of whom still live below the poverty threshold. \r\nHow can our collective conscience remain indifferent \r\nin the face of such a situation? \r\n Giving this alarming observation, we feel that \r\nTogo should be able to benefit from special assistance, \r\nwhich would allow it to raise its economic level and to \r\nbolster, as a result, its young democracy. I should thus \r\nlike to make an urgent appeal to all of our development \r\npartners that they decide to support our efforts in the \r\nface of the major challenges before us. The assistance \r\nthat we are requesting and the Togolese Government’s \r\nown efforts will allow my country to work towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs).  \r\n The maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity remains a prerequisite for any development \r\nprocess. Togo thus reaffirms its devotion to the ideals \r\nof peace, security and stability, both within and outside \r\nof States. My country feels that threats to peace and \r\nsecurity on the African continent require that the \r\nUnited Nations become more involved than it has so \r\nfar. \r\n However, I am pleased to pay tribute to the role \r\nthat has been played and continues to be played by the \r\nOrganization in Africa with regard to the restoration of \r\npeace and security in certain countries, particularly in \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 44 \r\n \r\nLiberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n We also feel that Chad, Burundi and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic should benefit from firm actions for \r\npeace and security in order to put an end to acts of \r\nviolence and to consolidate peace, democracy and \r\npolitical stability in these countries.  \r\n As regards Côte d’Ivoire, my country is pleased \r\nto note that, despite the delay in the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations road map, the peace process has \r\nreached a key phase with the signing of the \r\nOuagadougou peace agreement on 4 March 2007, the \r\nlighting of the flame of peace on 30 July 2007 and the \r\nannouncement of the presidential election in the next \r\nfew months. \r\n As regards Sudan, Togo welcomes the adoption \r\non 31 July 2007 by the Security Council of resolution \r\n1769 (2007) on the deployment in Darfur of a hybrid \r\nUnited Nations-African Union peacekeeping force. We \r\nhope that the international community will do \r\neverything in its power to ensure that the necessary \r\nlogistical and financial means are made available for \r\nthis mission. \r\n My country also urges the other rebel factions \r\nthat did not participate in the Arusha discussions in \r\nAugust 2007 to join the negotiating process in order to \r\nreach a comprehensive peace agreement. \r\n As regards Somalia, Togo makes an appeal to the \r\ninternational community that it become more involved, \r\ntogether with the African Union, so that a \r\npeacekeeping force can be deployed there. \r\n Beyond Africa, our eyes turn constantly to Iraq \r\nand the Middle East, still in the grips of violence. As \r\nregards the Middle East, Togo supports the idea of \r\norganizing an international conference under the aegis \r\nof the Quartet in order to restart the process of direct \r\nand constructive negotiations. From this viewpoint, \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians should be encouraged to \r\npersevere with dialogue in order to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive and lasting settlement, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.  \r\n However, the prerequisite for any negotiation \r\nbetween the two parties lies in the need to see all of the \r\nPalestinian elements overcome their internal \r\ndifferences.  \r\n In the area of disarmament and the control of \r\nweapons of mass destruction, Togo welcomes the \r\nbeginnings of a resolution to the North Korean nuclear \r\nissue with the historic agreement concluded between \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\ninternational community. In the same vein, as regards \r\nthe question of the nuclear programme of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, my country calls on the interested \r\nparties to pursue and give priority to talks, in order to \r\nachieve a negotiated solution that takes into account \r\nthe interests of the parties involved. \r\n With respect to light weapons, Togo expresses the \r\nhope that this session of the General Assembly will \r\nundertake strong commitments in order to strengthen \r\nefforts aimed at negotiating a treaty on trade in light \r\nweapons similar to what was done by the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS).  \r\n With respect to terrorism, which is also an \r\nobstacle to sustainable development, my country \r\nbelieves that, following the momentum that led to the \r\nadoption of the global strategy to combat this scourge, \r\nit is essential that we make universal and improve the \r\ninternational legal framework to combat terrorism.  \r\n In this respect, the rapid conclusion of \r\nnegotiations relating to the draft global convention to \r\ncombat international terrorism would be welcome and \r\nwould serve the interests of all countries and all \r\npeoples.  \r\n It is disturbing to note that today’s new economic \r\norder continues to produce a society where profit for \r\nprofit’s sake and inequalities of all kinds reign. The \r\nsolidarity which we have so keenly advocated in the \r\nUnited Nations has yet to be realized. At the very least, \r\nwe can say is that this situation penalizes the \r\neconomies of developing countries, which, due to \r\nglobalization, are frequently obliged to open their \r\nmarkets against their own interests. \r\n That is why we think that development, generally \r\nspeaking, should take place at the global level. From \r\nthis viewpoint, all countries should honour their \r\ncommitments related to the establishment of a global \r\npartnership aimed at promoting equitable and \r\nsustainable development for all.  \r\n Thus, Togo appeals once again to the \r\ninternational community, in particular to the developed \r\ncountries, that they increase their development \r\nassistance and promote international trade and direct \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n45 07-51962 \r\n \r\nforeign investment, particularly towards poor \r\ncountries. It is also essential to focus seriously on the \r\nurgent question of debt and to resume the Doha \r\nnegotiations so that trade liberalization will promote \r\nthe development of all nations, particularly the poorest \r\namong them. \r\n In this respect, we commend the commitments \r\nundertaken at the Group of Eight Summit, held in June \r\n2007 in Germany, to support the facilitation of \r\neconomic growth and investment, including \r\nmicrofinance; to support the establishment or \r\nstrengthening of development institutions in the private \r\nsector and structural reform which will improve the \r\neconomic environment; and to support efforts in the \r\nareas of health, in particular the prevention and \r\ntreatment of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. \r\n The high-level debates which the General \r\nAssembly held on 24 September once more illustrated \r\nthe fact that one of the major challenges that the \r\ninternational community must immediately tackle \r\nremains climate change, which is the source of \r\nnumerous natural disasters. \r\n Togo, which, like many other countries on the \r\ncontinent, has just experienced serious and deadly \r\nfloods, firmly believes that it is urgent that concrete \r\nactions be undertaken to begin a determined and \r\nconcerted struggle against environmental degradation. \r\nIt seems to us that the survival of planet Earth is at \r\nstake. \r\n The irreplaceable and unparalleled role of the \r\nUnited Nations in international relations should \r\nencourage us to reform this institution in the light of \r\npresent reality. However, we should not lose sight of \r\nthe fact that the reform of the Organization should \r\nreflect the principles of the sovereign equality of States \r\nand equitable geographical distribution and should help \r\nto strengthen cooperation on an equal footing among \r\nStates. It should also be based on the principle of broad \r\ninternational consensus, particularly when it involves \r\nissues involving the responsibility of all of the \r\nOrganization’s constituent parts. \r\n That is why Security Council reform must \r\nguarantee that all regions of the world be represented \r\nwithin that organ and enable developing countries, \r\nwhich play an important role in accomplishing the \r\ntasks of the Organization, to make their contribution, \r\nno matter how modest, to promoting peace worldwide. \r\n We hope that the present session of the General \r\nAssembly will bring hope to the international \r\ncommunity, and particularly to the African peoples, \r\nwho are waiting to see improvement in their living \r\nconditions and lives through decisive and tangible \r\nactions. \r\n In order to attain the objectives that we have set \r\nfor ourselves, in particular during the Millennium \r\nSummit, it is essential that we honour all of our \r\ncommitments within their time frames and that we \r\nassume additional commitments in order to bring about \r\na world free of fear, hunger, extreme poverty and \r\ndisease — a world where we will be able to live in \r\nsecurity. \r\n Togo, in its determination to construct a State \r\nbased on the rule of law and to improve the living \r\nconditions of its population, will spare no effort in \r\ncarrying out its obligations. It hopes it can count on the \r\nassistance of the international community in order to \r\ndo this. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. David Miliband, Secretary of State for \r\nForeign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \r\n Mr. Miliband (United Kingdom): It is a great \r\nhonour to make my first speech to the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The United Nations has a duty to lead the world \r\nin addressing the shared threats and opportunities that \r\ndominate our age, and it must do so in deed as well as \r\nin word. That is why I want to use this platform to \r\nexpress my admiration and support for United Nations \r\nmissions around the world, from Lebanon to Liberia, \r\nfrom Congo and Haiti to East Timor, which, even as we \r\nmeet in New York this week, are saving lives and \r\nspreading hope. \r\n Since 1946, when the first meeting of the General \r\nAssembly took place in London, the United Kingdom \r\nhas been determined to fulfil its international \r\nresponsibilities through the United Nations. The new \r\nGovernment in the United Kingdom, under the \r\nleadership of Gordon Brown, is proud to continue that \r\ntradition, and I reaffirm our commitment today. \r\n The focus at this session has been on immediate \r\nand pressing issues. In the Middle East, we need urgent \r\naction towards a two-State solution that addresses the \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 46 \r\n \r\nsecurity of Israelis and the rights of Palestinians at the \r\nsame time.  \r\n In Iraq, recent security gains can only be \r\nsustained through continued support for the \r\ndevelopment of the Iraqi security forces, through \r\nnational reconciliation and through political support \r\nfrom the whole region. \r\n Our international community depends on \r\nresponsibilities as well as rights. If Iran wants to be a \r\nleading and respected country, it must cease its support \r\nfor terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan and end its \r\ndefiance of three Security Council resolutions in \r\nrespect of its nuclear programme. \r\n In Zimbabwe, we need United Nations action to \r\nsupport African leadership to reverse the vicious cycle \r\nof economic and social devastation that now afflicts \r\nthe country. \r\n We have all seen the extraordinary scenes in \r\nBurma. I call on the regime to allow peaceful protest, \r\nencourage national dialogue and promote genuine \r\nreconciliation. Let us today send a message to the \r\nmonks on the streets of Burma: we support your \r\ndemand for a democratic Burma. And let us take a \r\nmessage from the monks on the streets of Burma: the \r\nhuman desire for freedom knows no bounds of race or \r\nreligion or region. It is good that the Burmese \r\nGovernment has allowed Ambassador Gambari into the \r\ncountry, but it is now vital that they use his presence \r\nthere to start the process of reconciliation. \r\n But as well as addressing the traumas of our \r\nfellow citizens around the world, the United Nations \r\nmust be the place where we address the longer-term \r\nthreats. Today, I devote my speech to one of the great \r\nthreats to stability and prosperity in the world: the \r\nthreat of global inequality. I do so because inequalities \r\nare not just morally offensive; they are also dangerous. \r\nInequality fuels extremism. It undermines support for \r\nan open, global economy. It corrodes trust and respect \r\nand reciprocity between nations. \r\n The United Nations Charter talks of the \r\n“sovereign equality of States”, and it also talks of the \r\n“equal rights and dignity of men and women and of \r\nnations large and small”. The principle of equality is \r\nnowhere more evident than in the General Assembly \r\nwhere all States have an equal voice. But in the world \r\noutside this Hall, economic, social and political \r\ninequalities within and between States persist and \r\nworsen. We cannot stand united against the shared \r\nthreats and opportunities in our world when we are so \r\ndivided by economic and political disparities. So the \r\nneed for Governments and international institutions to \r\nreduce inequalities and promote our common humanity \r\nis stark. \r\n Traditionally, we have focused on the divide \r\nbetween developed and developing nations. However, \r\nthe growth rates in many developing countries are \r\nfaster than in developed economies. That is the good \r\nnews. But there remain around a billion people in the \r\nworld — one sixth of its population — living in 58 \r\ncountries, who have been left out of the story of human \r\nprogress. This “bottom billion” have an average life \r\nexpectancy of 50 years. Fourteen per cent of the \r\nchildren in the bottom billion die before their fifth \r\nbirthday, and more than a third suffer malnutrition. The \r\ncountries that are home to the bottom billion saw their \r\nnational incomes fall each year during the 1980s and \r\n1990s. \r\n Even where inequalities are narrowing between \r\nnations, they are widening within them. According to \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, in 73 \r\ncountries — containing 80 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation — economic inequality has risen in recent \r\nyears. \r\n Every nation represented here has responsibilities \r\nto its own people. The drive to tackle poverty needs \r\nopen markets. It needs the empowerment of citizens \r\nthrough democratic and transparent institutions, free \r\nfrom corruption. It needs strong and effective \r\neducation and health services open to all. \r\n But national action is not enough. Because the \r\ncauses of inequality cross national boundaries, we need \r\ncooperation between nations, bilateral and multilateral, \r\nled by the United Nations. \r\n First, three quarters of the countries where the \r\nbottom billion citizens reside have recent or current \r\nexperience of civil war. Conflict is the trapdoor to \r\nextreme poverty. Look at Darfur: more than 200,000 \r\npeople are dead, 2 million are displaced and 4 million \r\nare on food aid. As the international community, we \r\ndecided on a course of action in Security Council \r\nresolution 1769 (2007). Now we need to get on with it: \r\nan agreement on force composition, swift deployment, \r\neffective protection of civilians on the ground and a \r\npolitical process in which the legitimate grievance of \r\nthe Darfur people is addressed through negotiation. In \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n47 07-51962 \r\n \r\nAfghanistan, one of the five poorest countries in the \r\nworld, we need to back up military efforts to secure \r\nsafe space with economic, social and political \r\nreconstruction. \r\n Beyond those crises, we also need to improve our \r\ncapacity to prevent the emergence of conflict. That is \r\nour vision of the responsibility to protect. A critical \r\ndimension is controlling the spread of weapons whose \r\neasy availability makes it so simple to set up militias \r\nand provoke violence and mayhem. Last year, the \r\nAssembly voted overwhelmingly to take forward \r\nUnited Nations work towards an arms trade treaty (see \r\nresolution 61/89). The Government of the United \r\nKingdom will continue to press for the achievement of \r\nthat goal. \r\n Secondly, freedom from conflict is the platform \r\nfor progress, but the battle against disease and \r\nilliteracy is the second stage. Despite progress in some \r\ncountries, the world is off track to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That is why, in July here \r\nat the United Nations, the Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom launched a call for action: to honour our own \r\ncommitments and go further, to build a truly global \r\npartnership — with the private sector, trade unions, \r\nfaith groups, civil society and cities — that can meet \r\nthe 2015 MDG targets. That requires the developed \r\nworld to meets its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of \r\nits national incomes on development. The United \r\nKingdom will meet that commitment by 2013. But that \r\nrequires shared responsibility. Poor governance and \r\ncorruption are the enemies of development. \r\n Thirdly, progress on aid needs to be combined \r\nwith a new global trade deal that opens up economies \r\non a fair basis. Western producers continue to benefit \r\nfrom subsidies and tariffs, particularly for agriculture. \r\nHigher tariffs for processed goods prevent poor \r\ncountries from diversifying their economies. That is a \r\nbad deal for Western consumers, and it squeezes out \r\nthe livelihoods of producers in poor countries. Neither \r\nis it in rich countries’ financial self-interest, nor is it \r\nfair. The Government of the United Kingdom believes \r\nthat concluding the Doha trade round this year is not \r\njust necessary, but also possible, and we will work to \r\nachieve that goal. \r\n Finally, we must address the greatest long-term \r\nthreat to our aspirations to tackle inequality: climate \r\nchange. Climate change affects all countries, but the \r\npoorest countries — and the poorest people within \r\nthose countries — will suffer the most disruption and \r\ndevastation. I congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly on choosing climate change as a central \r\ntheme of this general debate. And I congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General on his leadership on this issue. But \r\nwe need more than debate. \r\n The United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change is the only body that can conclude a \r\nglobal agreement on climate change. Therefore, in the \r\nnext two months we need an urgent agreement on the \r\nsteps towards progress to be taken at the December \r\nmeeting in Bali. Beyond that, we need a road map to \r\nthe 15th conference of parties to the Convention, to be \r\nheld at Copenhagen in two years’ time, and agreement \r\non a global deal that succeeds the end of the first \r\ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. \r\n At the heart of such an agreement must be the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities: \r\nall countries taking on responsibilities, but making sure \r\nthat they are equitably distributed, with the greatest \r\naction taken by the richest countries. The United \r\nKingdom stands ready to play its part. This year, our \r\nclimate change bill will be enacted into law in the next \r\nsession of Parliament to place on a statutory footing \r\nour commitment to cut carbon emissions by at least 60 \r\nper cent from 1990 levels by the year 2050. But we \r\nneed similar binding commitments from all rich \r\ncountries. \r\n The challenges are therefore immense. Crisis \r\nresolution and conflict prevention, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, a new trade deal, climate \r\nchange — they call for all our resources. Military \r\nintervention is never the whole solution, but sometimes \r\na solution cannot be found without armed force. \r\nDevelopment budgets are necessary, but the developing \r\nworld needs a growth plan, not just an aid plan. \r\nDiplomacy needs to bridge differences between \r\nnations, but also to reach out to civil society and \r\nbusiness. \r\n The United Kingdom is proud not just of its \r\nbilateral relations with the countries represented in the \r\nAssembly, but also of its commitment to multilateral \r\ninstitutions, which can be a force for good in the world. \r\nBut international institutions need to reflect the world \r\nas it is, not the world as it was. The United Kingdom \r\ntherefore welcomes the prospect of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations at this session to achieve agreement on \r\nreform of the Security Council. We support permanent \r\nA/62/PV.9  \r\n \r\n07-51962 48 \r\n \r\nmembership for Germany, Japan, India and Brazil and \r\npermanent representation for Africa. We are not \r\nwedded to a single model of reform. Achieving \r\neffective change is what matters. \r\n In a world where more than a billion people are \r\nonline, where companies have bigger turnovers than \r\ncountries and where global non-governmental \r\norganizations have memberships that are bigger than \r\nnational populations, our international institutions must \r\nlook inwards to internal reform, but also outwards to \r\nbroader popular movements for change. \r\n In the last phase of globalization, in the \r\nnineteenth century, the emergence of new Powers and \r\nthe breakdown of the international order resulted in \r\nconflict that scarred the whole of the twentieth century. \r\nUnless we can build trust and reciprocity between \r\nnations and embody them in durable and robust \r\ninternational institutions that reconcile differences and \r\nnurture common values, the latest phase of \r\nglobalization could be another false dawn. \r\n Globalization is not just something to which we \r\nmust adapt; it is something that we can and must shape \r\nfor the achievement of our own goals. It must be put to \r\nuse spreading power, wealth and opportunity. For my \r\nGovernment, this mission is driven by both moral \r\npurpose and national interest. We must address the \r\ninsecurity and inequality that exist beyond our borders \r\nif we are to enhance security and prosperity within our \r\nborders. \r\n We live in a more prosperous, more peaceful and \r\nmore democratic world than ever before. Let us \r\ncommit ourselves to living in a more equal world. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.  \r\n I shall now call on those representatives who \r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. \r\n May I remind members that statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the \r\nsecond intervention and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats. \r\n Mr. Jeremić (Serbia): In response to today’s \r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of Albania, I would \r\nlike to state the following. By advocating the \r\nindependence of Kosovo, a province of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, the Prime Minister of Albania is openly calling \r\nfor the violation of the territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty of a Member of the United Nations and a \r\nneighbouring country with which a country should \r\nhave good relations, in its own interest and in the \r\ninterest of its population. \r\n Such a position is in violation of each and every \r\nbasic principle of the United Nations, as well as all the \r\ndecisions on Kosovo adopted by the United Nations. \r\nMoreover, it comes on the eve of tomorrow’s first \r\nround of direct negotiations between Serbs and Kosovo \r\nAlbanians on the future status of the province here in \r\nthis city of New York. \r\n The Prime Minister of Albania is doing this \r\nbecause the province of Kosovo is nowadays inhabited \r\nmostly by ethnic Albanians. To understand fully the \r\ngravity of this act, one only needs to imagine every \r\ncountry calling for the independence of a part of a \r\nneighbouring country which happens to be inhabited \r\nmostly by their own ethnicity. There are many such \r\nsituations. Can we imagine the havoc that would ensue \r\nif every such country followed the example set by the \r\nPrime Minister of Albania? \r\n I leave representatives of Member States with \r\nthat question. \r\n Mr. Basha (Albania): The Republic of Albania \r\nbelieves in good-neighbourly relations with all of its \r\nneighbours, including Serbia. It believes that the path \r\nof the region is that of Euro-Atlantic integration, and it \r\nshares that vision with most of its neighbours. It \r\ncertainly hopes the same for the Republic of Serbia. \r\n The Republic of Albania espouses no other \r\nagenda but the one set forth by a process started here at \r\nthe United Nations by the Secretary-General through \r\nhis Special Representative, President Ahtisaari, a \r\nproposal that is fair, balanced and sustainable, that \r\nenjoys the support of the overwhelming majority of the \r\nmembers of the Assembly and the Security Council and \r\nthat is the only true answer — not only for peace and \r\nsecurity in Kosova, but also for peace and security in \r\nthe region — not only for today, but also for \r\ntomorrow — not only for the future of the Kosovar \r\npeople, but also for the future of the Serb people, the \r\nAlbanian people, the Macedonian people, the peoples \r\nof Croatia, Montenegro and the entire region. This is a \r\nfuture that moves away from our bitter recent past \r\nincited by ethnic hatred and racial discrimination \r\ntowards cooperation between nations, free and \r\nindependent, enjoying full rights and liberties for \r\n A/62/PV.9\r\n \r\n49 07-51962 \r\n \r\nthemselves and for the minorities incorporated in their \r\nsocieties. \r\n That is a vision that is shared by European \r\nPowers. It is shared by the emancipated Powers in the \r\nworld. That is the vision Albania too espouses. \r\n Albania hopes that the negotiations, which will \r\ncontinue tomorrow in New York and until the end of \r\nthe 120-day period, are going to produce a solution. It \r\nfurther hopes that the Security Council can undertake \r\nthe next step, to sanction this move for the benefit of \r\npeace and security for Kosova, Serbia and the entire \r\nregion. \r\n But the Republic of Albania is also conscious that \r\nour primary duty is for peace and security in the \r\n \r\nregion, and that the balanced, fair and sustainable \r\napproach that we have now in our hands, in the form of \r\nthe internationally mediated proposal of President \r\nAhtisaari, is and must provide the basis in case of \r\nfailure. \r\n While wishing the best of luck to the negotiators \r\ntomorrow, and supporting fully the efforts of both \r\nparties to find an agreement, we subscribe to the view \r\nthat, at the end of the period, the inalienable right of \r\nthe Kosovar people to self-determination will serve not \r\nonly to build the last sovereign State out of the \r\ndissolution of the former Yugoslavia, but also to build \r\nthe bridges — both European and Euro-Atlantic \r\nbridges — for the peoples of Serbia and beyond. \r\n  The meeting rose at 8.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
