(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Win \r\n(Myanmar), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia. \r\n Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Emanuel Mori, President \r\nof the Federated States of Micronesia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mori: I am honoured by this \r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session. This great institution plays a vital \r\nrole in the development process of its members and \r\nremains the global organization best situated to address \r\nthe world’s pressing needs and to help find solutions \r\nfor them. So, it is with pleasure that I use this occasion \r\nto make the following remarks on a few challenging \r\nissues of vital significance confronting Micronesia \r\ntoday. \r\n I must first congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \r\npresidency of the Assembly. He has my delegation’s \r\nadmiration and full support. In the same vein, I \r\ncommend the dedication and stewardship of Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, President of the Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. \r\n I wish to offer my greetings to our able Secretary-\r\nGeneral and to express the best wishes of my \r\nGovernment as he continues to lead the Organization \r\nthrough the difficult challenges ahead. \r\n The General Assembly is meeting at a time of \r\nunusual uncertainties surrounding the global economy. \r\nThe world financial situation and the double threat \r\nposed by the fuel and food crises impose additional \r\nstrain on all of us and negatively impact our efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nand our pursuit of sustainable development. The \r\nsecurity of our island countries remains under threat by \r\nthe effects of climate change. \r\n The fuel crisis is a major challenge to the \r\nMembers of this Organization. There are few countries \r\nin this world that are left unscathed by the worldwide \r\nfuel crises. Too often, I am afraid, those most affected \r\nby the crisis are those Members of the United Nations \r\nthat can least afford an effective response. More often \r\nthan not, they are the small island developing States \r\nthat are also the most vulnerable Members of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n The developed countries may have room to \r\nrespond to the worsening energy crisis without \r\njeopardizing other development programmes. But for \r\nus in Micronesia, we are painfully aware of the strong \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 2 \r\n \r\nand adverse impacts on everything from government \r\noperations to the effect on individual households and \r\nfamilies. \r\n In a very real sense, the lingering global energy \r\ncrisis has transformed the energy debate and \r\nhighlighted the world’s dependence on fossil fuel. \r\nPower outages in our state centres have become a \r\nregular phenomenon affecting our medical facilities, \r\nschools, businesses and everyday government \r\noperations, including services to our remote outer \r\nislands, which are reachable only by ships. These \r\nsetbacks are the result of our inability to procure fuel at \r\na reasonable cost. While we recognize that fossil fuel \r\nwill, in the medium term, remain a necessity, the \r\ncurrent energy crisis strengthens Micronesia’s resolve \r\nto call for the acceleration of the development of \r\ntechnologies for renewable and affordable sources of \r\nenergy. Micronesia recognizes that special assistance \r\nfrom the international community and financial \r\ninstitutions in the area of renewable energy is \r\nnecessary to achieve this goal. We are grateful to our \r\nfriends that have over time generously extended \r\nassistance to that end. \r\n The General Assembly, by its own resolutions, \r\nrecognizes everyone’s right to food. On a global scale, \r\nthat right is being threatened as the world faces a \r\nsevere food crisis. Already, the cost of imported \r\nfoodstuffs has increased considerably, and my \r\nGovernment and people are thus faced with yet another \r\ndevelopment challenge — one that has already been \r\nexacerbated by the energy crisis. The cost of rice, one \r\nof the main imported foodstuffs, which has become a \r\nmain staple in my people’s diet, is no longer \r\naffordable. My Government, in responding to the food \r\ncrisis, has encouraged the people to increase the local \r\nproduction of our own crops. But that cannot be \r\nachieved without the support and cooperation of our \r\ndevelopment partners and the United Nations system. \r\n The nexus between food security and climate \r\nchange cannot be overlooked. In Micronesia, farmlands \r\nand inhabitants occupy the low-lying fringes and \r\nislands barely a few metres above sea level. Taro \r\npatches, which provided the main staple of our people \r\nfor centuries, are now under threat by sea level rise. \r\nAlready, many islands have experienced inundation of \r\ntheir taro patches and fields of other food crops by salt \r\nwater, resulting in decreased crop production. \r\n Of equal importance to our self-sufficiency and in \r\nmeeting some of our nutritional needs is the bounty of \r\nour ocean. The ocean is of fundamental importance to \r\nMicronesia, as we rely heavily on it. The ocean \r\nsustains us, and its resources enrich us. At a time when \r\nthe world food market is deeply affected by the food \r\ncrisis, Micronesians are increasingly dependent on the \r\nbounty of the sea to provide for their food and for their \r\neconomic development. It is therefore of paramount \r\nimportance that we continue to conserve and manage \r\nsustainably the use of our marine and fisheries \r\nresources. But collateral catches and discards in \r\ncommercial fisheries remain a concern to us. For \r\nMicronesians, these are critical resources that are of \r\ncultural importance, and our people depend upon them \r\nfor their subsistence living. The international \r\ncommunity must help us find ways to minimize and \r\neliminate this wasteful use of resources. \r\n Equally damaging to fish stocks is the incidence \r\nof illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. \r\nThis practice continues to deprive our people of their \r\nfood resources, while the illegal operators continue to \r\nreap and enjoy the rewards from this activity without \r\nany accountability. The major consumer and market \r\noutlets must reduce this illegal activity if we are to \r\neffectively eliminate this abhorrent and unsustainable \r\npractice. \r\n The world’s financial turbulence, as evidenced by \r\nthe current delicate situation in the host country, is \r\nanother matter of concern. While the situation \r\nemanates from the bigger economies, all of us are at \r\nrisk, as we are all part of the globalized economy. We \r\nencourage the developed countries not to use this as a \r\nconvenient excuse to reverse their gains in reaching the \r\nagreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic \r\nproduct for official development assistance. \r\n My delegation is encouraged by the spirit and \r\ndetermination of the Members of the United Nations to \r\nbring Security Council reform a step closer to reality. \r\nOur task remains difficult, but we are encouraged by \r\nthe recent decision of the General Assembly and look \r\nforward to the beginning of the process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Among other things, \r\nwe reiterate our support for the expansion of both \r\nmembership categories and reaffirm our long-standing \r\nview that Japan and India, from the Asian Group, \r\nshould become permanent members of a reformed \r\nSecurity Council. We also renew our support for \r\nGermany, from Western Europe. \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n3 08-51851 \r\n \r\n In the attainment of the international \r\ndevelopment goals, there is no single issue that \r\npresents such an enormous challenge to small island \r\ndeveloping States, such as the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, than that of climate change. Micronesia is \r\nespecially concerned about climate change and the \r\ngrave threat of sea-level rise, which can literally wash \r\naway our islands and culture. Three recent articles have \r\nbeen published in the prestigious science journal \r\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \r\naddressing the tipping points for abrupt climate \r\nchange, including sea-level rise. \r\n A tipping point is a point of no return beyond \r\nwhich an element of the climate system abruptly tips \r\ninto a new state, with a profound impact on the planet. \r\nExamples include tipping points for the melting of \r\nglaciers and snow pack from the Tibetan Plateau — the \r\nheadwaters of most of the rivers in Asia — and the \r\ndisintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice \r\nsheets, which will cause metres of sea-level rise. \r\n The news is startling. Simply put, it means that \r\nthe planet is in peril — and the islands and low-lying \r\nStates are, of course, in peril. But we cannot afford to \r\nbe paralysed. We must undertake an aggressive \r\nprogramme of fast-track mitigation strategies, starting \r\nwith those that are already justified by their strong \r\nco-benefits. This includes the strategy Micronesia \r\npromoted last year and again this year to strengthen the \r\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the \r\nOzone Layer. Our strategy can play a strong role in \r\nprotecting the climate system as well as the \r\nstratospheric ozone layer. \r\n Let me make one final suggestion. Tipping points \r\nfor abrupt climate change have been called the shadow \r\nthat haunts climate negotiations. This issue is a shadow \r\nbecause it has never been squarely addressed by the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \r\n The global debate on climate change is \r\npredominantly framed from a sustainable development \r\nperspective. We could not agree more with that focus. \r\nBut Micronesia is convinced that, while sustainable \r\ndevelopment is of paramount importance, we must also \r\nbe assured of our security and our territorial integrity. \r\nWe must approach climate change from a holistic \r\nperspective rather than limiting it to the dimensions of \r\nsustainable development, to humanitarian or technical \r\nissues, or to economic or environmental issues. \r\nClimate change also has an impact on our human \r\nrights. It has an impact on international peace and on \r\nour own security and territorial integrity, and on our \r\nvery existence as inhabitants of very small and \r\nvulnerable island nations. \r\n Experts have warned that climate change is also a \r\nthreat to international peace and security. Yet, instead \r\nof addressing the issue squarely, the United Nations \r\nseems to be more concerned about turf and \r\nencroachment, as if it were wrong to admit that \r\nterritorial integrity, national stability and security \r\nmight be threatened by the impact of climate change, \r\nand that human conflicts might also arise as a direct or \r\nindirect result of climate change. Just as the IPCC \r\nreports, the Stern Review report and the 2007 Human \r\nDevelopment Report inform the negotiations in the \r\ncontext of the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, a report analysing the potential \r\nimpact of climate change on international peace and \r\nsecurity should provide additional reasons for urgent \r\nand adequate climate change mitigation actions. \r\n Our future — our environment — is at stake. Our \r\nculture and our human rights are at stake. But we must \r\nnot lose hope, because the entire world is represented \r\nhere. The time to act is now, not later. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, President of \r\nThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau. \r\n Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. João Bernardo Vieira, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 4 \r\n \r\n President Vieira (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): It is with great \r\npleasure that I extend my warmest congratulations to \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. In electing him amidst this rather complex \r\nglobal scenario, the international community places \r\nconfidence in his qualities as a statesman, a spiritual \r\nleader and a defender of the most disenfranchised. \r\n For my part, I am convinced that the experience \r\nthat Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann gained at a historic time \r\nand in the particular circumstances in the lives of the \r\nfriendly people of Nicaragua will serve him well in \r\nanalysing and better understanding the challenges we \r\nface in this, the first decade of the twenty-first century. \r\nI count on his wisdom and balance, in the conviction \r\nthat spiritual force will always inspire him and help \r\nhim preside over our deliberations with success. He \r\ncan count on my personal support and on the \r\ncooperation of the delegation of my country, Guinea-\r\nBissau. \r\n Allow me also to thank his predecessor for the \r\nresults achieved at the last session. I would also like to \r\nexpress our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his dedication and for the spirit of \r\ninnovation he has shown in fulfilling his duties. His \r\nreport on the international situation (A/63/1) \r\nemphasizes the gravity of the major challenges the \r\nworld is facing as well as the complexity of the \r\nreforms that are needed to improve the functioning and \r\nefficiency of the Organization and the working \r\nconditions for its staff. \r\n We agree with him that in order to more \r\nefficiently solve the numerous problems of our planet, \r\nwe need an organization which is less bureaucratic, \r\ncapable of adopting new technologies and possessing \r\nsufficient financial means and competent and highly \r\nmotivated staff. We support the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General with a view to increasing the \r\nOrganization’s capacity to maintain peace and to \r\naddress global issues. We also support his proposal to \r\nintroduce, in the Secretariat in particular, new working \r\nmethods based not only on the recognition of \r\nindividual skills, but also on an emphasis on teamwork. \r\n The present international situation demands \r\nserious reflection about the cause of the present crisis \r\nwhich greatly affects our countries. The three main \r\nelements of the crisis — energy, food and international \r\nfinances, to which we would add the disastrous \r\nconsequences of climate change — call for a better \r\ncoordination of our efforts in the pursuit of innovative, \r\ncourageous and adequate solutions leading to the \r\nestablishment of a new world order, one which is more \r\njust and equitable and which is capable of responding \r\nto the realities of an interdependent and globalized \r\nworld. \r\n The increase in oil prices has destabilizing effects \r\non our economies. The cost of producing electrical \r\nenergy in particular has become an unsustainable \r\nburden for the poor countries and a major obstacle to \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n In my country, Guinea-Bissau, for example, the \r\nlack of energy seriously compromises all socio-\r\neconomic activities, particularly hospital care and the \r\ndistribution of drinking water, which is essential for \r\nguaranteeing hygiene and public health. How can a \r\npoor country like ours face the unjustified increase in \r\nthe price of oil? What means do we have at our \r\ndisposal to face the adverse consequences of a system \r\nwhich has been poorly based on speculation and which \r\nhas nothing to do with the law of supply and demand? \r\nIs it not the right time for us to think about creating a \r\nworld fund to mitigate the effects that are jeopardizing \r\nour ability to reach the Millennium Development \r\nGoals? How can we invest in and improve our \r\ninfrastructure in such vital areas as health, education \r\nand agriculture if we are continuously compelled to \r\nspend enormous resources from our already limited \r\nfunding to purchase fuel? \r\n Moreover, the tremendous increase in food prices \r\non the international market and the hunger and \r\nmalnutrition which could affect many countries, in \r\nAfrica in particular, are also matters of great concern \r\nand impel us to take action and implement appropriate \r\nagricultural policies with sufficient financial means so \r\nthat we can invest in the creation of modern and \r\naffordable means of production. \r\n Saying that agriculture is a priority should not be \r\na mere slogan. We need to be reminded that the right to \r\nfood is a fundamental right and is enshrined in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, whose sixtieth \r\nanniversary we are celebrating this year. Every country \r\nshould be able to guarantee food autonomy. We \r\ntherefore need to examine and reformulate conditions \r\nfor obtaining agricultural credits in particular. \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n5 08-51851 \r\n \r\n A food shortage can pose a serious threat to the \r\npeace and security of a country. At the international \r\nlevel, we need to seriously discuss how to improve our \r\ncapacity to respond effectively to the food crisis by \r\nputting into practice new scientific knowledge and by \r\napplying technologies suited to the climate conditions \r\nof the various regions of our planet and to the social \r\nand economic realities of our respective peoples. \r\n In an interdependent and globalized world, we \r\nhave to strive to establish and ensure respect for rules \r\ncapable of regulating the international, financial and \r\ntrading system without impeding the free flow of \r\ncapital. But the international financial system, which is \r\nalready affected by serious distortions, cannot be based \r\nonly on a quest for speculative profit and on unlawful \r\nbehaviour, which can have enormous consequences, as \r\nis the case now in many countries, where thousands of \r\nfamilies have financial difficulties, particularly in the \r\narea of housing credits. Unfortunately, the \r\nconsequences of these poor practices are not limited to \r\na few countries. \r\n The international community must react to all of \r\nthese challenges. But how can we succeed without \r\nclose cooperation among all countries of the world? We \r\nneed cooperation in order to face climate change and to \r\nmitigate the effects of natural disasters such as the \r\nterrible hurricanes which have caused so much \r\ndestruction in countries in the Caribbean, such as Cuba \r\nand Haiti, and also in Houston, Texas.  \r\n Our main goal should be to foster dialogue in all \r\ncircumstances — dialogue among the countries, \r\npeoples, cultures, religions and civilizations of the \r\nworld. It is only through dialogue that we will be able \r\nto identify our differences and find solutions in our \r\ncommon interest.  \r\n We need dialogue and negotiation at the \r\ninternational level to prevent and solve conflicts, such \r\nas the conflict in the Middle East, and to preserve the \r\nlives of human beings in danger, in Darfur and in \r\nSomalia, for example. We need dialogue and \r\nnegotiation to defend and protect the most vulnerable, \r\nin particular women and children, by promoting and \r\nensuring respect for human rights, the principle of \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. \r\n At the national level, we need dialogue aimed at \r\ncreating appropriate conditions for the consolidation of \r\ndemocracy through free, transparent and credible \r\nelections, as we intend to do in Guinea-Bissau on \r\n16 November.  \r\n Finally, we should further dialogue and \r\nnegotiations with the view to promoting a policy of \r\ninclusion that guarantees the active participation of all \r\nstakeholders, above all women and youth, and civil \r\nsociety in general, in building peace and political \r\nstability and in creating the necessary conditions for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Although confronted with complex international \r\nsituations, the international community has ways of \r\nfacing those challenges. However, real political will is \r\nneeded from us all. The United Nations can play an \r\neven more decisive role in preventing and resolving \r\nconflicts, in protecting our planet and in creating better \r\nliving conditions for millions of people. Thus we need \r\na United Nations that is better organized, less \r\nbureaucratic and better suited to confronting those \r\nmany challenges. \r\n We reiterate our full support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in the implementation of \r\nmuch-needed reforms for the greater efficiency, \r\ncapacity to respond and credibility of the United \r\nNations. We equally support the reform process \r\nundertaken by the Member States of our Organization \r\nin order to democratize the United Nations system, in \r\nparticular the Security Council, the enlargement of \r\nwhich remains a priority for us all, considering the new \r\neconomical and political reality of today’s world and \r\nabove all the need to address the historic injustice done \r\nto the continent of Africa for more than 60 years. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has just made. \r\n \r\nMr. João Bernardo Vieira, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of \r\nState of the Kingdom of Swaziland \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Head of State of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland. \r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 6 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n King Mswati III: I am pleased to address this \r\nAssembly on behalf of my delegation from the \r\nKingdom of eSwatini. The Assembly gives us the \r\nopportunity as Heads of State and Government to share \r\nideas and experiences. It enables us to shape the future \r\nof our countries and pave a way for a better world, \r\nwhere we can all live with each other in harmony. Let \r\nme extend our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon and to the entire staff of the United Nations \r\nfor their efforts in carrying out the vision and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations. \r\n The world continues to face many challenges, \r\nwhich include the catastrophic effects of climate \r\nchange, complicated diseases such as tuberculosis, \r\nmalaria and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and food \r\nshortages. That situation is further compounded by \r\nhigh prices for fuel and food and the instability in \r\ninternational finance, which slow down our efforts to \r\nfight poverty and attain sustainable development. \r\n It is encouraging to note that the United Nations, \r\nin particular the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nand the World Food Programme, continues to assist \r\ndeveloping countries to find lasting solutions to the \r\nfood crisis. In the light of that, my country has put in \r\nplace various strategies to ensure food security. The \r\nnation continues to hold consultations on those issues. \r\nFor instance, we had a national agricultural meeting \r\nlast year and the Sibaya — the people’s parliament — \r\nthis year, which looked at ways of increasing our food \r\nproduction and other issues of national interest. The \r\nnation came up with different suggestions, and we are \r\nin the process of implementing them. \r\n We developing countries were looking forward to \r\npositive results from the Doha round of negotiations, \r\nparticularly on agriculture. Developing countries were \r\nhoping for secure and increased market access for their \r\nagricultural products. Unfortunately, that has not been \r\nthe case. We hope those talks will be concluded soon \r\nfor the benefit of the developing countries. \r\n Swaziland fully supports the global dialogue to \r\nensure that the world is rescued from the dangers of \r\nglobal warming and other damage to the environment. \r\nIt is true that global warming is a major contributor to \r\nthe many calamities such as earthquakes, flooding and \r\npersistent droughts that threaten the very existence of \r\nthe human race. \r\n Swaziland, like many other countries of the \r\nworld, continues to be a victim of the devastating \r\neffects of climate change. We continue to suffer from a \r\npersistent drought. We continue to be hit by strong \r\nwinds that cause wildfires. Those fires often destroy \r\nvast acres of our man-made forests, resulting in \r\neconomic disruption, the waste of many years of \r\ninvestment and loss of life and property. We fully agree \r\nwith the United Nations that failure to respond in a \r\ntimely way and decisively to that threat will undermine \r\nnational and international efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), which aim to \r\nimprove the living standards and welfare of all our \r\npeoples. \r\n The high-level meeting on Africa’s development \r\nneeds came at the most opportune time. We are pleased \r\nwith the adoption of the declaration (resolution 63/1) \r\nand we are looking forward to its effective \r\nimplementation. There is indeed urgency in addressing \r\nAfrica’s special needs, in particular economic \r\ndevelopment, poverty reduction and issues of peace \r\nand security. \r\n It should be noted that the cooperation and \r\nsupport of the international finance institutions is \r\npivotal, for instance by ensuring improved accessibility \r\nto finance for Africa. That should also include making \r\ngrants and loans available to African countries under \r\npreferential rates to fund infrastructure development, \r\ntechnology transfer, tourism and other projects that are \r\nmeant to create wealth and economic growth. \r\n As we pass the midpoint to the 2015 deadline for \r\nthe MDGs we still face many challenges. This is more \r\nso because many of our people are still living in \r\npoverty and we continue to face a high unemployment \r\nrate. Notwithstanding, the commitment of the Kingdom \r\nof Swaziland to the achievement of the MDGs is \r\nunwavering. The MDGs are anchored within our \r\nnational development strategy and the poverty \r\nreduction strategy and action plan, which aspire, \r\namong other things, to reduce poverty by more than \r\nhalf by 2015. All Government programmes are geared \r\ntowards that vision and are being implemented with the \r\nguidance of all stakeholders and the nation at large. \r\n Like many other countries, the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland is on track for some of the MDGs. We are \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n7 08-51851 \r\n \r\ndoing everything possible to achieve universal \r\neducation and are providing resources for every child \r\nto go to school. Efforts are being made to achieve \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women, \r\nensure environmental sustainability, reduce child \r\nmortality and to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria, among other targets. \r\n Peace, stability and security, which form the \r\nprimary goals of the United Nations, remain key pillars \r\nof meaningful development. When those conditions \r\nprevail, our peoples can concentrate their energies and \r\nresources on the pursuit of productivity and wealth \r\ncreation. \r\n Members of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity (SADC) are committed to upholding those \r\npillars for a better life for all. We have put in place \r\nstructures such as the SADC Organ on Politics, \r\nDefence and Security to ensure their preservation and \r\npromotion. For that reason, we applaud the recent \r\nsigning of the power-sharing agreement and the \r\nestablishment of a Government of national unity in \r\nZimbabwe. We look forward with optimism to the \r\nrebuilding process and the removal of all bottlenecks. \r\nIn that regard, we urge the international community \r\nand the developed world to fully support the people of \r\nZimbabwe. In the same spirit, we wish to see \r\npeacefully negotiated settlements for all conflicts that \r\nprevail in Africa and in different parts of the world. \r\n The Kingdom of eSwatini joins the rest of the \r\nworld in condemning all forms and acts of terrorism. \r\nWe support efforts for the full implementation of the \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy in order to send a \r\nclear message to all perpetrators of terrorism. In line \r\nwith the United Nations convention on terrorism, our \r\nparliament has recently promulgated the anti-terrorism \r\nact. \r\n If the United Nations is to have a more effective \r\nrole, its structure must be reformed to adapt to a world \r\nthat has been constantly changing since the adoption of \r\nthe Charter. These reforms should of course take place \r\nin a fair, just and balanced manner. It has been \r\nobserved in the past that one of the most important of \r\nthe reforms that require urgent attention is that of the \r\nSecurity Council. The widely held view is that the \r\nSecurity Council as constituted at present falls short of \r\nproper demographic representation of United Nations \r\nMembers. The Kingdom of eSwatini looks forward to a \r\nspeedy conclusion to the discussions on the reform of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n We welcome the recent handshake between the \r\nsenior leadership of the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\nand that of mainland China. This handshake gives us \r\nhope that the two are now talking to each other. \r\nHopefully, this might lead to an amicable resolution of \r\nthe cross-Strait relations, such that perhaps one day we \r\nmight see them sitting next to each other here at the \r\nUnited Nations. It should be noted that the people of \r\nTaiwan have expertise and experience, which they are \r\nready to share with the United Nations family. That is \r\nwhy Swaziland requests the United Nations to allow \r\nTaiwan to participate in its specialized agencies. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland has just held a \r\nsuccessful parliamentary election under a new \r\nconstitution. The voter turnout was most impressive as \r\nthe people exercised their right to vote for a \r\ngovernment of their choice. As the nation continues to \r\nappreciate the power of parliamentary representation in \r\na complex globalized world, we note that the electorate \r\nunderstands the importance of choosing candidates of \r\nhigh calibre with the capacity to handle the issues at \r\nhand. That gives us confidence that the new Parliament \r\nwill assist with strategies that will further improve our \r\nsocio-economic climate for the betterment of the living \r\nstandards of our people. \r\n The Kingdom of eSwatini reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to the purpose and preservation of the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in multilateral \r\naffairs. We treasure peace and development and \r\namicable regional and international relations and, \r\ntogether with all nations, will work towards a peaceful \r\nand prosperous future for all humankind. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. José Ramos-Horta, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste. \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 8 \r\n \r\nMr. José Ramos-Horta, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. José Ramos-Horta, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ramos-Horta (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): First of all, I \r\nwould like to congratulate Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on \r\nhis well-deserved election to preside over the \r\nsixty-third session of the General Assembly. The \r\nsustained increase in the cost of energy, the growing \r\ndemand for oil by industrialized countries and \r\nemerging economies, higher food prices, the lack of \r\narable land and water in many regions and climate \r\nchange are only some of the indicators of \r\nnon-conventional threats to security that we all face \r\ntoday and increasingly in the future.  \r\n But crises also offer opportunities. Throughout \r\nthe decades, hundreds of millions of people all over the \r\nworld abandon their ancestral lands and move to cities \r\nin search of work and a better life, as Governments \r\nfocus their attention and resources on cities and \r\nneglected rural populations. But as urban populations \r\nswell in numbers, the dream of a better life is turning \r\ninto desperation. However, the twenty-first century \r\nmay witness their return to their places of origin, if \r\nGovernments can learn from this crisis and seriously \r\ninvest in job creation programmes for rural areas, \r\nparticularly in agriculture, in order to increase food \r\nproduction. \r\n Increasing food costs, whatever the cause may be, \r\nare neutralizing the progress achieved in many \r\ndeveloping countries towards the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. If the international \r\ncommunity does not redouble and coordinate its efforts \r\nto significantly boost development assistance and \r\nmarket access, it will be nearly impossible for poor, \r\nnon-oil-producing countries to achieve even the modest \r\ngoals that we had set for them in 2001 with a view to \r\nreducing poverty in the world by half by 2015. Donor \r\ncountries must quickly readapt their aid for \r\ndevelopment, emphasizing agriculture, particularly in \r\nsupport of small family and community projects, \r\npreservation of land and rainwater recovery, by \r\nincreasing the percentage of official development \r\nassistance (ODA) from a modest 3 per cent in 2006 to \r\nat least 30 per cent. I note that in 1980, the percentage \r\nof all foreign aid dedicated to agriculture was 17 per \r\ncent, which had dropped to 2.9 per cent by 2006. \r\nTimor-Leste accordingly supports the initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General to establish a High-Level Task Force \r\non the Global Food Security Crisis and an integrated \r\nframework in order to deal with immediate food needs \r\nworldwide and to provide the most vulnerable \r\ncountries with the capacity they need to become self-\r\nsufficient. \r\n As a newly independent country, Timor-Leste has \r\nbenefited much from the generosity of the international \r\ncommunity. Donors will say that they have contributed \r\nhundreds of millions of dollars to my country in the \r\nlast few years, and that is true. However, we must ask \r\nourselves if the aid has helped to improve the lives of \r\nthe majority of our population. The answer is yes and \r\nno. But we all could do better if the bulk of the aid was \r\nnot used to cover the costs of the endless study \r\nmissions and redundant reports, but was invested on \r\nthe ground in small rural development initiatives. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Timor-Leste is a least developed country. \r\nHowever, Almighty God has bestowed on us some \r\nmodest oil, gas and other mineral wealth. Our oil and \r\ngas revenues are modest, averaging only $100 million \r\nto $150 million a month. It could be argued that, for a \r\ncountry of slightly over one million people, this \r\namount is not too bad. By the end of this year, our \r\nPetroleum Fund, which was established in 2005, will \r\nhave accumulated in excess of $3 billion, all invested \r\nin United States treasury bonds. A writer in The \r\nEconomist recently stated that those who invest in \r\nUnited States treasury bonds are people who like to \r\nlose money. We may be among them. We agree with \r\nthat remark, and Timor-Leste is seeking to reinvest our \r\nmodest revenues in diversified portfolios around the \r\nworld. \r\n While our first obligation is to make use of our \r\noil wealth for the sustainable development of our \r\ncountry and to address the immediate needs of our \r\npoorest, we are not indifferent to the suffering of our \r\nfellow human beings in other parts of the world. When \r\nthe Asia region was hit in December 2005 by a tsunami \r\nof major proportions, our Government immediately \r\ncontributed $50,000 for the victims in Indonesia, and \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n9 08-51851 \r\n \r\nour citizens took up their own collection of donations \r\nand raised an additional $70,000. \r\n Now, in response to several natural disasters that \r\nhave affected tens of millions of our fellow human \r\nbeings, Timor-Leste promptly decided to donate \r\n$500,000 for the victims of the earthquake that hit the \r\nChinese province of Sichuan; $500,000 for the victims \r\nof Cyclone Nargis that hit Myanmar on 2 May, to be \r\nchannelled through the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) Secretariat; and $500,000 for Cuba \r\nto assist the victims of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, to \r\nbe channelled directly to the Cuban authorities. \r\nStarting in 2009, Timor-Leste will contribute \r\n$1 million annually to assist child-related programmes \r\nin Myanmar and Somalia through United Nations \r\nagencies like UNICEF and the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\n(UNHCR). \r\n We believe that, even though we are poor, or \r\nbecause we are poor, we should better understand and \r\nfeel the pain of the poorest of the poor and must be \r\namong the first to help others less fortunate than us. \r\n In my address today, I shall touch upon three \r\ninternational issues: Myanmar, the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba and the question of Western \r\nSahara. \r\n Timor-Leste’s stance on Myanmar is aligned with \r\nthe stance taken by our immediate neighbours in the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. We believe in \r\nparticular that while strong denunciations of abuses are \r\njustifiable and that sanctions might be morally \r\njustifiable, there cannot be a long-term solution in \r\nMyanmar without the consent and full partnership of \r\nthat country’s army. Hence, the challenge for those \r\ninvolved is to persuade the military that their own \r\ninterests as a group will not be compromised in any \r\nfuture democratic arrangement. Any other strategy \r\nseeking to sideline the military or that the military sees \r\nas undermining their power and future safety will not \r\nsucceed and will only prolong the agony of all in that \r\nsad country. \r\n Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, which brought \r\ndevastation to the Caribbean, ruined the Cuban \r\neconomy. The country’s material losses are staggering, \r\nwith initial estimates showing the losses to approach a \r\ntotal of at least $5 billion. Timor-Leste has nearly \r\n700 East Timorese medical students in Cuba, and over \r\n140 East Timorese are studying medicine in our \r\nnational university with Cuban medical instructors. In \r\naddition, there are nearly 300 Cuban doctors working \r\nin our country, distributed through all districts and \r\nsub-districts. Cuban adult education specialists assist \r\nus in our adult literacy campaign, benefiting thousands \r\nof adults. The costs of those programmes are borne \r\nalmost entirely by Cuba. \r\n Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n While I commend the United States and any \r\ncountry that stands for universal democratic values and \r\nthat provides moral support for those promoting \r\ndemocracy in their own countries, I submit that \r\npunitive measures imposed on poor developing \r\ncountries for the perceived sins of their leaders cannot \r\nbe morally justified. \r\n As a friend of the United States, I humbly appeal \r\nto its next Administration and to Congress to lift the \r\nembargo against Cuba. Such a gesture would be \r\nhonourable, and my admiration for the United States \r\nwould only increase. As it is, as I witness the impact of \r\nUnited States sanctions on a small developing country, \r\nas well as its refusal to provide unconditional \r\nassistance to Cuba following the devastation caused by \r\nHurricanes Gustav and Ike, my heart bleeds in sorrow \r\nand my admiration for the United States seriously \r\ndiminishes. In that connection, I wish to express once \r\nagain our most heartfelt sympathy and solidarity with \r\nthe people of Haiti and others in the Caribbean region \r\nwho were affected by the recent natural disasters. \r\n With regard to the situation in Western Sahara, \r\nTimor-Leste is guided by the stance taken by the \r\nregional organization that is most competent on this \r\nmatter — the African Union — and guided by the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council and the Advisory Opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, all of which clearly and \r\nunequivocally recognize the inalienable right of the \r\npeople of Western Sahara to self-determination. That is \r\nthe core of the issue and the root cause of the ongoing \r\nconflict. Hence, Timor-Leste joins with the African \r\nUnion in calling for strict respect for the inalienable \r\nright of the Saharawi people to self-determination. \r\n I now turn to the situation in my own country. On \r\n11 February, I was shot and nearly died as a result. I \r\nescaped by an act of God and thanks to the \r\nprofessionalism and dedication of doctors and nurses at \r\nthe Australian army medical centre in Dili and the \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 10 \r\n \r\ndoctors and nurses at the Royal Darwin Hospital. To \r\nthem, and to all who have prayed for my life and my \r\nrecovery, I once again express my eternal gratitude. I \r\nstood at the frontier between life and death; I saw the \r\ndarkness of death and the beauty of life, which I nearly \r\nleft behind. \r\n The attack against Prime Minister Gusmão and \r\nmyself shocked the nation, and my near-death served to \r\nunite the people in opposing violence. Since then, the \r\nsituation in Timor-Leste has been more peaceful than it \r\nhas been in many years, without any politically \r\nmotivated violence so far; even common crime has \r\nbeen significantly reduced. The Government, led by \r\nMr. Gusmão, a resistance hero, has made enormous \r\nefforts in stabilizing the country and delivering \r\nservices to the people. Progress is visible. A growing \r\nnumber of internally displaced persons are returning \r\nhome. Most camps are now empty. More than \r\n700 former soldiers involved in the 2006 mutiny have \r\naccepted a Government financial package and have \r\nreturned home. \r\n On the economic front, our real gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP) will show a 7 per cent increase by the \r\nend of this year. However, if oil and gas revenues are \r\nfactored in, our economic growth will be \r\napproximately 19 per cent. While our real annual GDP \r\nper capita is less than $400, that figure jumps to more \r\nthan $4,000 if oil and gas revenues are factored in. \r\nHowever, we would not have succeeded in pulling back \r\nfrom the brink without the prompt and steadfast \r\nsupport of the international community. I thank the \r\nSecretary-General and, through him, the entire \r\nUnited Nations family, in particular those serving in \r\nmy country in various capacities, for their selfless \r\ncontributions to the preservation of peace in \r\nTimor-Leste. \r\n I also thank Australia and New Zealand for \r\nmaintaining a robust and credible security force in my \r\ncountry in support of, and in close coordination with, \r\nour Government and the United Nations Integrated \r\nMission in Timor-Leste, under the leadership of \r\nMr. Atul Khare, Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General, who is a most compassionate \r\nhuman being and a dedicated and tireless professional. \r\n The professionalism of the International Security \r\nForces is visible to all, and the behaviour of the \r\nsoldiers is irreproachable. The same can be said of the \r\nUnited Nations police force in my country, comprising \r\npolice from 40 countries, with particular reference to \r\nformed police units from Portugal, Pakistan, Malaysia \r\nand Bangladesh. We are blessed by the Almighty with \r\nnon-negligible resources, and we can count on the \r\ngenerosity of our development partners, but challenges \r\nremain complex and multifaceted. However, I am \r\nconfident that, with a shared vision and a commitment \r\nto serve the poorest of the poor, we will meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We cannot fail. We \r\nshall not fail. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. José Ramos-Horta, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Zimbabwe. \r\n Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, and to invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Mugabe: I wish to begin by joining \r\nthose who have congratulated Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session. My delegation is confident that, \r\nunder his able stewardship, the General Assembly will \r\nmake progress on many issues scheduled for discussion \r\nduring the current session. I would also like to pay \r\nspecial tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Kerim, who \r\nsuccessfully presided over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session.  \r\n The focus of our discussions at the present \r\nsession, namely, the impact of the global food crisis on \r\npoverty and hunger in the world, as well as the need to \r\ndemocratize the United Nations, relates well to our \r\nMillennium Development Goals. For us in the \r\ndeveloping world, the eradication of poverty is the first \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n11 08-51851 \r\n \r\nof our priorities and should indeed continue to receive \r\nserious attention. \r\n The current global food crisis, characterized by \r\nescalating food prices, is causing untold suffering for \r\nthe majority of poor people in many developing \r\ncountries. That has been compounded by the energy \r\ncrisis, with devastating social and economic \r\nconsequences, especially for the most vulnerable in \r\nsociety such as women, children, the elderly and \r\npeople living with HIV and AIDS. The crisis now \r\nqualifies as a humanitarian emergency that requires \r\nglobal solidarity to provide post-haste assistance in the \r\nform of food, water and energy. \r\n For most developing countries, the crisis is \r\ncompeting with other pressing demands for scarce \r\nresources for development, including achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially as \r\nwe are faced with declining official development \r\nassistance and foreign direct investment. The trend \r\nwill, regrettably, reverse some of the progress made \r\ntowards the attainment of the MDGs. It is therefore \r\ncrucial that national efforts aimed at addressing the \r\nglobal food and energy crises be complemented by \r\nappropriate international assistance and interventions, \r\nincluding debt cancellation for low-income, \r\nfood-deficient developing countries so as to release \r\nmore resources to fight hunger.  \r\n Adequate support for food production \r\nprogrammes is absolutely necessary. We call for more \r\nresearch into better seed varieties and assistance in \r\nirrigation technology and improved water harvesting \r\nmethods, necessary to mitigate the effects of climate \r\nchange on agriculture. Zimbabwe believes that the \r\nchallenges of climate change should be addressed in \r\nthe context of development programmes that recognize \r\nthe three pillars of economic and social thrusts, as well \r\nas environmental protection. \r\n In the past year, Zimbabwe is proud to have \r\nplayed its modest part in promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment through its chairmanship of the sixteenth \r\nsession of the United Nations Commission on \r\nSustainable Development. The session examined the \r\nobstacles and barriers to development in the areas of \r\nagriculture, land use and rural development, and to \r\ndrought-mitigation measures and desertification \r\nprevention in Africa. My Government, which was an \r\nactive participant at the High-Level Conference on \r\nWorld Food Security, held under the auspices of the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization in Rome in June \r\nthis year, will continue to play its active role in \r\nformulating policy recommendations on the subject of \r\nsustainable development targets. \r\n We share the view that trade is an important tool \r\nfor development, and so we reiterate our call for an \r\nopen, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory \r\ntrading and financial system that seeks the removal of \r\nthe main trade barriers. Tariffs have unfortunately \r\nremained high on goods from developing economies, \r\nsuch as textiles and farm products. It is therefore \r\ndisturbing that the Doha Round negotiations have \r\ncollapsed without any indication of when they will be \r\nreconvened. \r\n The objectives of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations in the economic arena will remain \r\nunfulfilled unless all Member States genuinely and \r\nseriously participate in efforts to redress challenges \r\nthat persist in developing countries. Social justice, \r\npolitical stability and sustainable development in most \r\ndeveloping countries can best be achieved through \r\ngenuine and committed support for empowerment \r\nprogrammes through, inter alia, just land ownership \r\npatterns. We understand only too well in our context \r\nthat sustainable development is not possible without \r\nagrarian reform.  \r\n My Government has therefore gone a long way \r\ntowards laying the foundation for sustainable food \r\nproduction through its land reform programme. The \r\nmajority of our rural people have been empowered to \r\ncontribute to household and national food security and, \r\nindeed, to be masters of their own destiny. However, \r\nthe effects of climate change, which have included \r\nrecurrent droughts and floods in the past seven years, \r\nand the illegal, unilaterally imposed sanctions on my \r\ncountry have hindered Zimbabwe’s efforts to increase \r\nfood production. Once again, I appeal to the world’s \r\ncollective conscience to apply pressure for the \r\nimmediate removal of those sanctions by Britain, the \r\nUnited States and their allies, which have brought \r\nuntold suffering to my people. \r\n Zimbabwe has always been and continues to be a \r\nfirm believer in multilateral approaches to solving \r\ndisputes, as opposed to the unilateralism favoured by \r\nsome countries. Our experience has shown that the \r\ncooperative and pacific approach often leads to lasting \r\nsolutions to conflicts. We therefore deplore the \r\nvindictive approach, which is often characterized by \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 12 \r\n \r\nself-righteous finger-pointing, double standards and the \r\nimposition of unilateral sanctions, to coerce smaller \r\nand weaker countries to bow to the wishes of militarily \r\nstronger States. \r\n In addition, the unilateral and coercive economic \r\nmeasures that we have witnessed in recent years are \r\nagain completely at cross purposes with the principles \r\nthat guide international cooperation, as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n Not long ago, some permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council sought to invoke Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations so that its weight of \r\nsanctions and other measures could be applied against \r\nmy small country, which, by any stretch of the \r\nimagination, is no threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity. What insanity is this that has afflicted some \r\nworld leaders? Should that sacred document, the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, be allowed to suffer \r\nsuch undeserved emasculation and disgraceful abuse? \r\nAnd where is the protection of small and innocent \r\ncountries like mine from threatened and real acts of \r\naggression and punitive acts, often based on \r\ncompletely false allegations of violations of the rule of \r\nlaw, democracy or human rights? By the way, those \r\nwho falsely accuse us of those violations are \r\nthemselves international perpetrators of genocide and \r\nmass destruction. \r\n The innocent masses of men, women and children \r\nwho have perished in their thousands in Iraq surely \r\ndemand retribution and vengeance. Who shall heed \r\ntheir cry? Surely those who invaded Iraq under false \r\npretences and on the strength of contrived lies and in \r\ncomplete violation of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law must be made liable for them. \r\nThey must be made to answer for their acts of \r\naggression. \r\n Zimbabwe derives solace from the fact that there \r\nare some permanent members of the Security Council \r\nthat have taken principled stands in defending the \r\nCharter and protecting our sovereignty by ensuring that \r\nthe Council acts not only within its mandate, but also \r\nimpartially, objectively and justly. Indeed, their sense \r\nof justice ensured that Zimbabwe — a country that \r\nposes no threat to regional or international peace — did \r\nnot fall prey to the cocktail of lies and machinations \r\nthat had been designed by our detractors to encourage \r\nUnited Nations sanctions against us under Chapter VII. \r\nWe thank them for upholding truth and objectivity.  \r\n While we recognize the important role of the \r\ngood offices of the Secretary-General in helping \r\nMember States to resolve political and other problems, \r\nwe are of the view that international civil servants \r\nshould discharge their noble duties with sensitivity and \r\nneutrality. At no time should they seek to pander to the \r\nwhims and caprices of the mighty against the weak. \r\nSimilarly, we call on certain Security Council members \r\nto desist from abusing the Secretariat in an attempt to \r\npromote their political interests. It is our firm belief \r\nthat the Secretary-General and his staff should be \r\nallowed to serve all Member States without fear or \r\nfavour. \r\n We reiterate our long-held view that the Security \r\nCouncil as presently constituted is undemocratic. Its \r\npresent configuration renders it subject to manipulation \r\nby the powerful countries that use the Council as a \r\nreadily available legitimizing forum for their political \r\nmachinations. Thus, it is imperative that the Security \r\nCouncil be democratized by ensuring equitable \r\ngeographical representation through an increase in its \r\nmembership. Zimbabwe remains steadfast in its \r\nsupport for the Ezulwini Consensus, which calls for \r\nAfrica to have two permanent seats with the same \r\npowers and prerogatives as the current permanent \r\nmembers, as well as two non-permanent seats. \r\n We share the view that the General Assembly, a \r\nbody that represents all of us and enjoys a wider \r\nrepresentation of States, must continue to be the \r\nsupreme decision-making body of the United Nations. \r\nWe call for its revitalization to make it more effective \r\nand to enable it to fully carry out its Charter mandate. \r\nIt is our fervent hope that a revitalized General \r\nAssembly will reassert its prestige, its pre-eminent \r\nrole, its authority and its capacity to guide and direct \r\nother organs of the United Nations system. In that \r\ncontext, the tendency of some members of the Security \r\nCouncil to usurp the power and mandates of the \r\nGeneral Assembly must be resisted. \r\n I am pleased to report that the inter-party talks in \r\nZimbabwe — for which our regional grouping, the \r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC), \r\nappointed a facilitator — ended with the signing of an \r\nagreement on the formation of an all-inclusive \r\nGovernment on 15 September. That was achieved \r\nentirely through African mediation, which is clear \r\ntestimony that Africa is capable of overcoming its own \r\nchallenges and problems, which, by the way, are often \r\nthe remnants of colonialism. African leaders, working \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n13 08-51851 \r\n \r\ntogether, were able to find an African solution to an \r\nAfrican problem. In that regard, I wish to pay special \r\ntribute to President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, \r\nwhose patience, fortitude, sensitivity, diplomatic skills \r\nand painstaking work made it possible for the \r\nZimbabwean parties to overcome what had appeared to \r\nbe insurmountable and intractable difficulties in \r\nreaching an agreement. \r\n I would like to extend my thanks to SADC, the \r\nAfrican Union and individual African and other leaders \r\nwho lent their support to that initiative. My party, the \r\nZimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, will \r\nabide by the spirit and letter of the agreement to which \r\nwe have appended our signature. As the Government, \r\nwe are prepared to cooperate with all other countries \r\nthat respect Zimbabwe’s sovereignty. I would therefore \r\nlike to appeal to those members of the international \r\ncommunity that have imposed illegal sanctions against \r\nZimbabwe to lift them so that my country can focus \r\nundisturbed on its economic turnaround programme. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that we will continue to \r\nshape an Organization that upholds universal values \r\nand interests, attends to the urgent needs of those in \r\nneed and remains in the service of humanity. Long live \r\nthe United Nations!  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic \r\nof Cameroon \r\n  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cameroon.  \r\n Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of Cameroon, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Biya (spoke in French): I should like \r\nat the outset to welcome the fact that Nicaragua, \r\nrepresented by Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, is \r\npresiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. Cameroon wishes him every success in \r\ncarrying out his mission and assures him of its full \r\ncooperation. I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute \r\nto Ambassador Kerim for the skill with which he led \r\nthe work of the Assembly at its sixty-second session. \r\nFinally, I congratulate His Excellency Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, and reiterate our appreciation \r\nand support for his remarkable efforts in discharging \r\nhis lofty mission. \r\n By proposing the impact of the global food crisis \r\non poverty and hunger in the world and the need to \r\ndemocratize the United Nations as main themes of the \r\ngeneral debate at the sixty-third session, the President \r\nfocused our deliberations on core problems currently \r\nfaced by the international community. I support this \r\nproposal all the more because Cameroon, like other \r\ncountries throughout the world, has recently \r\nexperienced social upheaval caused by the increasingly \r\nhigh cost of living. \r\n As a result, we decided on and implemented a \r\nseries of corrective measures, ranging from a reduction \r\nof taxes and customs duties on certain basic \r\ncommodities to an increase in the salaries of State \r\nemployees and measures to stabilize fuel prices. Those \r\nmeasures were lauded by the International Monetary \r\nFund and undoubtedly had very positive effects. They \r\ndid not, however, totally eliminate a problem of global \r\nproportions and one which requires global responses. \r\nThe food crisis, which is one manifestation, has taken \r\non alarming proportions throughout the world. All \r\neconomies, irrespective of size, but particularly those \r\nof poor countries, are seriously affected. The most \r\nvulnerable populations are forced to forego health care \r\nand education just to feed themselves. \r\n If appropriate responses are not found rapidly, \r\nthere will be reason to fear dramatic repercussions on \r\ninternational trade, economic growth, social progress, \r\npolitical stability and, hence, global security. There is \r\ntherefore an urgent necessity to act rapidly and \r\ncollectively. We believe an appropriate response to the \r\nsituation lies in ensuring coordination at the highest \r\nlevel. That is why I welcome the fact that the \r\nSecretary-General took the initiative to establish the \r\nHigh-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security \r\nCrisis, whose aim is to promote a coherent and unified \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 14 \r\n \r\nresponse to the crisis. Cameroon shares the vision \r\ncontained in the Comprehensive Framework for Action \r\nprepared by the Task Force. \r\n We are of the view that a lasting solution to the \r\ncrisis requires short- and medium-term actions, \r\nincluding increased food aid and investment in \r\nagriculture, the promotion of social welfare initiatives, \r\nreduction of agricultural subsidies in developed \r\ncountries and restrictions on food exports from \r\ncountries of the South. It is obvious that such solutions \r\ncannot be implemented without the participation of all \r\nand without the establishment of global food and \r\nagriculture partnerships involving all stakeholders, \r\nnamely Governments, the private sector, civil society, \r\ndonors and international institutions. \r\n At a time when the midterm assessment of the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals is \r\nunder way, the global food crisis appears as one of the \r\nmajor challenges the international community will \r\nhave to face. In that regard, Cameroon wishes to join \r\nits voice to that of the Secretary-General in appealing \r\nfor financing of the measures recommended by the \r\nTask Force. But, however acute the food crisis may be, \r\nit is far from being the only snag in the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n Concerning Africa in particular, there are many \r\nother challenges, such as persistent poverty, peace and \r\nsecurity issues and the effects of climate change. \r\nConcerning poverty alleviation, our continent placed \r\nmuch hope in globalization which it supported in good \r\nfaith, despite legitimate fears concerning the \r\nglobalization of trade. It should be acknowledged that, \r\non the whole, these hopes were dashed.  \r\n Beyond the global food crisis, it is obvious that \r\nAfrica has felt the negative effects of the international \r\nfinancial crisis and the exponential oil price hikes: \r\nphenomena well beyond its control. In addition, it \r\nhelplessly watched the erosion of official development \r\nassistance and the failure of the Doha Round \r\nnegotiations, where its interests were relegated to the \r\nbackground. This role of powerless onlooker can only \r\nlead to deep frustration and cast doubts on the chances \r\nof achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\nwithin the set time frames. \r\n Nevertheless, Africa wants to believe that the \r\ninternational community will not give up assisting it to \r\nemerge from poverty and underdevelopment. For that \r\nreason, we fully appreciate the initiative of the \r\nUnited Nations to organize high-level meetings \r\ndevoted to the development of our continent, on the \r\nsidelines of this session. On the economic front, \r\nAfrica’s immense potential remains largely untapped, \r\nand, although many African countries have been \r\nrecording good economic performance, the continent \r\nremains the poorest on the planet. Hence the need for \r\nincreased solidarity of the international community. \r\n The growing impact of climate change, especially \r\nin Africa, is particularly disturbing; more than \r\nelsewhere, it affects areas on which the fate of future \r\ngenerations depends. There is thus an urgent need for \r\njoint action by the international community. \r\n Such solidarity should also prevail when \r\naddressing the issue of migrants. The tragedies they \r\nexperience are, to put it bluntly, inhuman. The \r\natrocities and acts of discrimination they endure on a \r\ndaily basis are intolerable. There is urgent need to \r\njointly seek solutions to manage this exodus which \r\ndrains Africa of the human resources it greatly needs. \r\nThere is no gainsaying that the economic development \r\nof the continent is the one and only solution to that \r\npainful problem. \r\n As regards peace and security, perhaps more than \r\nin any other area, Africa needs the active solidarity of \r\nthe international community. There is reason to be \r\nsatisfied with the progress made in several countries \r\nthat were hitherto plagued by deadly confrontations, \r\nthough it should be acknowledged that many hotbeds \r\nof tension and conflict still exist on the continent.  \r\n Here, the peace agreements signed after lengthy \r\nnegotiations are yet to enter fully into force. There, \r\nforce is used to jeopardize democratic achievements. \r\nContinuing confrontations in Somalia, the chronic \r\ninstability along the borders of Chad, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and the Sudan, the daily tragedy \r\nfaced by the population of Darfur and the recurrent \r\neruption of violence in the east of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and in Burundi are all cause for \r\nserious concern. \r\n Unfortunately, nor is our continent spared the \r\nthreat of terrorism, which now has a global dimension. \r\nI am convinced that only global and resolute action \r\nwill help address that issue. Cameroon will contribute \r\nits support as necessary. \r\n The international community, and in particular \r\nthe United Nations, are making commendable efforts to \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n15 08-51851 \r\n \r\npromote peace in Africa. That is why the Organization \r\nmust receive from all its Members the resources that it \r\nneeds to ensure the effectiveness of its action. To that \r\nend, it should constantly express the common will and \r\ncontinue to be the crucible of the democratization of \r\ninternational relations. \r\n The historic achievement recorded in the \r\nsettlement of the dispute over the Bakassi peninsula is \r\none of the best examples of the remarkable results that \r\ncan be generated by an authentic desire for peace \r\nshared by the parties, with the judicious support of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The ceremony in Calabar on 14 August 2008, \r\nwhich marked the withdrawal of the Nigerian \r\nadministration and police force from Bakassi and the \r\ntransfer of authority to Cameroon, was undoubtedly the \r\nresult of the commitment to peace shown by the \r\nleaders and peoples of both countries. In that regard, I \r\nwish to express my profound gratitude to friendly \r\ncountries for the support they have continued to give to \r\nthe implementation of the ruling of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and to the Greentree Agreement. I \r\nwish to thank in particular the States witness to the \r\nAgreement, namely, the United States of America, \r\nFrance, the Federal Republic of Germany and the \r\nUnited Kingdom. \r\n The United Nations also played a decisive role in \r\nthe settlement of that matter. The tireless efforts of \r\nSecretaries-General Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-moon and \r\ntheir representatives within the Mixed Commission \r\ndeserve our gratitude. \r\n Thus dawned a new era in relations between \r\nCameroon and Nigeria, geared towards the quest for \r\nprogress and development to which our two peoples \r\naspire. It goes without saying that the two countries \r\nmust henceforth do everything possible to consolidate \r\nthe settlement and seize the opportunities offered to \r\nthem to develop their relations in all areas. In that \r\nregard, I wish to reaffirm that Cameroon will respect \r\nall its commitments. \r\n The delay in the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals must spur us to redouble our \r\nefforts to carry out vigorous, joint and mutually \r\nsupportive actions in fighting against poverty and for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Government of Cameroon is resolutely \r\ncommitted to that end. I wish to pay homage to our \r\npopulation for the sacrifices they have made in that \r\nrespect, as well as to our bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners for the multifaceted assistance they are \r\nproviding to us. That assistance is invaluable to us, \r\nparticularly in our efforts to promote better \r\nmanagement of public resources. Within that \r\nframework we have launched a fierce fight against \r\ndishonest managers, which we intend to pursue \r\nruthlessly. \r\n Guided by a concern to improve the well-being of \r\nour people, we reaffirm from this rostrum our \r\ndetermination relentlessly to pursue our efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. To \r\nperform that task successfully, we know that we can \r\ncount on the understanding and support of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cameroon for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan. \r\n  Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Pakistan, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Zardari: I come before the Assembly \r\ntoday in the name of my late wife, Shaheed Mohtarma \r\nBenazir Bhutto, as a victim of terrorism representing a \r\nnation that is a victim of terrorism. I am a husband who \r\nhas seen the mother of his children give her life \r\nfighting the menaces of terrorism and fanaticism, \r\nwhich haunt the entire civilized world. In her place and \r\nin her honour, I come before the Assembly as the \r\nelected President of a democratic Pakistan who \r\nreceived a mandate from two thirds of our Parliament \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 16 \r\n \r\nand assemblies. That extraordinary mandate of support \r\nwas a vote of confidence in her, in her doctrine and in \r\nher message. The vote was an act of love and a demand \r\nfor a democratic, moderate, modern, tolerant and \r\neconomically just Pakistan — the essence of the Bhutto \r\ndoctrine. \r\n It has been 11 months since the first attack on my \r\nwife, on 18 October 2007, was followed by the \r\nadoption of a United Nations resolution calling for an \r\ninquiry into that crime against humanity. That United \r\nNations resolution has so far been ineffective. After her \r\nassassination, on 27 December, the international \r\ncommunity demanded an independent inquiry — a \r\ndemand supported by resolutions adopted in Pakistan’s \r\nParliament and four provincial legislatures. \r\n Today, we still do not know what forces and \r\ninstitutions were involved — who plotted and planned \r\nand coordinated and trained and paid for the murder of \r\nmy wife, my nation’s beloved leader. A United Nations \r\ninvestigation into the murder of the leader of the \r\npeople of Pakistan would reassure them that the \r\ninternational community cares about them and that the \r\nUnited Nations Charter of justice is more than rhetoric. \r\nWe owe it to her. We owe it to history. If a country’s \r\nPresident and his children cannot obtain justice through \r\nthe United Nations, how will the poor and the \r\ndispossessed around the world find reassurance that the \r\nUnited Nations is capable of protecting the weak and \r\nthe suffering? \r\n In the name of humanity and in the name of \r\njustice, the Organization must move forward quickly \r\nwith the investigation into the assassination of Shaheed \r\nBenazir Bhutto so that, once and for all, the people of \r\nPakistan and the rest of the world will know whose \r\nbloody hands took away one of the greatest women in \r\nhistory.  \r\n My wife courageously returned to Pakistan last \r\nyear, openly confronting the forces of terror. Three \r\nmillion people turned out to welcome Benazir and the \r\nreturn of democracy to Pakistan. She was a brave \r\nwoman who understood the dynamics of our region and \r\nthe world — who understood the interrelationship \r\nbetween politics and economics, between social \r\ninjustice and political dictatorship. For years, she told \r\nworld leaders that dictatorship fuels extremism and that \r\npoverty fuels fanaticism. She outlined the Bhutto \r\ndoctrine of reconciliation, so brilliantly presented in \r\nher last book. The Bhutto doctrine sets out a dual \r\nmission of combating dictatorship and terrorism while \r\npromoting social and economic reform and justice for \r\nthe people of Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto understood that \r\ndemocracy was not an end, but a beginning; that a \r\nstarving child has no human rights; that a father who \r\ncannot support his family is someone ripe for \r\nextremism. \r\n  Mr. Win (Myanmar), Vice-President took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n The Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation is a road \r\nmap not only to a new Pakistan, but to a new era of \r\npeace and cooperation between East and West and \r\namong people of all faiths. It is a road map that, if \r\nfollowed, will enable us to avoid the clash of \r\ncivilizations and the clash of religions, which is the \r\nterrorists’ ultimate goal. \r\n The Bhutto doctrine is the new century’s \r\nequivalent of the Marshall Plan, which saved Europe \r\nafter the Second World War. While the Marshall Plan \r\nwas based on the principle that an economically sound \r\nEurope could and would resist communism, the pillar \r\nof the Bhutto doctrine is that an economically viable \r\nPakistan will be the centrepiece of the victory of \r\npluralism over terrorism. The Bhutto doctrine will \r\nultimately prove to be as critical to the victory of \r\nfreedom in this century as the Marshall Plan was \r\ncritical to the triumph of liberty in the last. Ours is the \r\ndoctrine of reconciliation; theirs is the doctrine of \r\ndeath. \r\n Her killers thought that her elimination would \r\nend her dream of a democratic Pakistan and that the \r\nBalkanization of our region would enable the forces of \r\ndarkness to prevail. But our nation rallied in the \r\naftermath of her brutal and tragic assassination. If \r\nAl-Qaida and the Taliban believed that, by silencing \r\nShaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, they were \r\nsilencing her message, they were very wrong. We have \r\npicked up the torch and will fight against terrorists who \r\nattack us and terrorists who use our territory to plan \r\nattacks against our neighbours or anywhere in the \r\nworld. \r\n Ours is a bloody fight, and neither the personal \r\npain that my children and I feel nor the pain of a nation \r\nthat has been robbed of its greatest asset, its greatest \r\nleader, can be fully expressed. But the terrorists’ lust \r\nfor blood and hate has not been satisfied. Only last \r\nweek, the forces of evil struck again in a bloody and \r\ncowardly attack against my people. A suicide truck \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n17 08-51851 \r\n \r\nbomb destroyed a great building in our capital, barely a \r\nstone’s throw away from my office and the House of \r\nParliament. \r\n Once again, Pakistan is the great victim in the \r\nwar on terror. And once again, our people wonder \r\nwhether we stand alone. Thousands of our soldiers and \r\ncivilians have died fighting against the common \r\nenemies of humanity. We have lost more soldiers than \r\nall the 37 countries combined that have forces in \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n The roots of today’s terrorism can be traced to a \r\nwar involving the world’s super-Powers in Afghanistan \r\nduring the 1980s. Afghanistan and Pakistan — and, \r\nincreasingly, the entire world — are reaping the bitter \r\nharvest sown towards the end of the cold war. The \r\nworld turned its back on Afghanistan after the Soviet \r\ndefeat. In Pakistan, we were left with 3 million \r\nrefugees within our borders. Their camps soon became \r\nbreeding grounds for intolerance and violence. The \r\nworld left South and Central Asia. We were left to live \r\nwith the consequences. And one of the greatest of those \r\nconsequences was the birth of Al-Qaida and the \r\nTalibanization of Afghanistan and parts of our tribal \r\nareas. \r\n Yet, we do not look back at history. We are \r\nvictims, but we will never be vanquished. On the \r\ncontrary, the more of our children’s blood they spill, \r\nthe stronger is our determination to defeat them. We in \r\nPakistan stand united and in defiance. We are resolved \r\nthat our future will not be dictated by those who distort \r\nthe spirit and laws of Islam for their sordid politics and \r\npolitical goals. \r\n We may be the targets of international terrorism, \r\nbut we will never succumb to it. Towards that end, we \r\nreach out to this Assembly and to the entire civilized \r\nworld. Terrorism cannot be fought by military means \r\nalone. Fighting it requires political will, popular \r\nmobilization and a socio-economic strategy that wins \r\nthe hearts and minds of nations afflicted by it. \r\n Unilateral actions of great Powers should not \r\ninflame the passions of allies. Violating our nation’s \r\nsovereignty is not helpful in eliminating the terrorist \r\nmenace. Indeed, such actions could have the opposite \r\neffect. \r\n Many participants in this great Hall today read \r\nabout terror, while we live it. We do not learn about \r\nterror from reading newspapers or watching the \r\nevening news. We see our children and our wives being \r\nblown up before us. Our cities, neighbourhoods, \r\nstreets, hotels and offices bear the brunt of the terrorist \r\nfanatic rage every single day.  \r\n A democratic Pakistan is in the process of \r\nreaching the national consensus necessary to confront \r\nand defeat the terrorists. Only a democratic \r\nGovernment can win this war. We are fighting the \r\nmenace and we will continue to do so. But this fight is \r\nfor the peace of the world. This fight is for the future \r\nof generations to come. Yes, we fight for ourselves, for \r\nour children, for our very soul. Yes, this war is our war, \r\nbut we need the moral, political and economic support \r\nof the international community. In our stability lies the \r\nworld’s security. Globalization is not just economic; it \r\nis also political. The terrorist vision strikes out at all \r\nnations. We must draw a line on their rampage. And we \r\nmust draw that line in Pakistan. \r\n The question I ask the world’s leaders in this \r\naugust Hall is whether they will stand with us, just as \r\nwe stand for the entire civilized world on the frontlines \r\nof this epic struggle of the new millennium. \r\n I stand before this Assembly as the President of a \r\ngreat nation that just recently, in a decade of brutal \r\nmilitary dictatorship, suffered human rights abuses and \r\nthe systematic destruction of the foundations of \r\ndemocracy and civil society. Sadly, all too often, the \r\nworld stood silent as dictators ruled our people with a \r\nbloody fist. Nations that were founded on democracy \r\nwere silent for reasons of expediency. My wife would \r\nsay that they danced with dictators. \r\n Today, as we meet here in New York, the \r\ndemocratically elected leader of Myanmar, Aung San \r\nSuu Kyi, continues to be imprisoned in Yangon. She \r\nhas suffered year after year under house arrest. The \r\nworld must demand that that great woman finally be \r\nfreed. We appreciate the efforts of Mrs. Laura Bush in \r\nthat regard. \r\n Today, the horror of terrorism that plagues our \r\nnation and threatens the world is a by-product of the \r\nlack of commitment to the values of democracy. When \r\nthe world betrays democracy, it sets the table for \r\ndisaster. We will all continue to pay the price. \r\n In these early years of the new millennium, there \r\nare two great battles before mankind. First, there is the \r\nbattle for democracy and liberty against dictators, the \r\nfight for universal human rights. That is the hallmark \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 18 \r\n \r\nof this Organization. At the same time, we are fighting \r\nin the trenches of the battle that will determine the \r\ncourse of this century — the battle against extremism \r\nand terrorism, between the forces of ignorance and the \r\nforces of education, between bigotry and tolerance, \r\nbetween justice and discrimination, between \r\nconfrontation and reconciliation. \r\n Democracy is not like a switch that can be turned \r\non and off when it is convenient. It is a universal value \r\nguaranteed to all men and women. The outcome of \r\nthese struggles will determine whether the noble \r\nexperiment embodied in the hallowed halls of the \r\nUnited Nations will succeed or fail. The struggle \r\nbetween the Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation and the \r\nterrorists’ doctrine of death will determine the future of \r\nmankind. Let not the extremists who would manipulate \r\nIslam for their political ends define us to the world. \r\nThey are rabid but they are few. It is time for the world \r\nto take notice. We are not the cause of the problem of \r\nterrorism; we are its victims. \r\n We are an aggrieved nation, not one that has \r\ncaused grief. We have largely fought this battle alone. \r\nWe have shared our airbases, our airspace, our \r\nintelligence and our armed forces in a coordinated \r\neffort to contain terrorism. \r\n It is time for the developed world to step up to \r\nthe plate to help us and in turn help itself. The fight \r\nagainst terrorism and extremism is a fight for the hearts \r\nand minds of people. It cannot be won by guns and \r\nbombs alone. The fight must be multifaceted. The \r\nbattleground must be economic and social as well as \r\nmilitary.  \r\n We will win when people are mobilized against \r\nfanatics. To mobilize them, we have to give them hope \r\nand opportunity for their future. They need jobs. Their \r\nchildren need education. They must be fed. They must \r\nhave energy. We must give people a stake in their own \r\ngovernment and we must demonstrate to them that \r\ndemocracy works, that democratic governance can \r\nimprove their everyday life. \r\n An economically viable Pakistan will be a stable \r\nPakistan. And a stable Pakistan will suck the oxygen \r\nout of the terrorist agenda. Economic justice and \r\npolitical democracy are the worst nightmares of \r\nterrorists. We must all fight this epic battle together as \r\nallies and partners.  \r\n But just as we will not let Pakistan’s territory be \r\nused by terrorists for attacks against our people and our \r\nneighbours, so we cannot allow our territory and our \r\nsovereignty to be violated by our friends. Attacks \r\nwithin Pakistan that violate our sovereignty actually \r\nserve to empower the forces against which we fight \r\ntogether.  \r\n I am a democratic President of a democratic \r\ncountry that intends to be a model to our region and to \r\nour religion. I am the President of a vibrant, modern, \r\ntolerant, peaceful, moderate democracy committed to \r\neconomic and social justice. People, including my \r\nwife, died for this movement. We will not waste their \r\nsacrifices.  \r\n We will work patiently to convince leaders in the \r\nFederally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and our \r\nPakhtunkhwa province to accept the writ of the \r\nGovernment and turn their back on terrorists. The \r\nterrorists may blow up our girls’ schools but we will \r\nrebuild them, brick by brick, inch by inch. We are in \r\nthis battle to win and we know how we have to do it. \r\n We will work together with our neighbours in \r\nAfghanistan and with the NATO forces stationed there \r\nto ensure security for our common border. We will \r\ncontinue the composite dialogue with India so that our \r\noutstanding disputes are resolved. As I discussed with \r\nthe Indian Prime Minister yesterday, whether it is the \r\ncore issue of Jammu and Kashmir or cooperation on \r\nwater resources, India and Pakistan must and will \r\naccommodate each other’s concerns and interests. We \r\nmust respect and work with each other to peacefully \r\nresolve our problems and build South Asia into a \r\ncommon market of trade and technology. \r\n Better relations between Pakistan, Afghanistan \r\nand India would help create a regional environment \r\nmore conducive to reducing militancy in our region. \r\nBut let me be clear to those in this Hall and to the \r\nterrorists lurking in their caves, plotting their next \r\nassault on humanity. If necessary, we will confront evil \r\nwith force — our police, our army and our air force. \r\nWe will turn the power of the State against the stateless \r\nterrorists. We will turn the power of justice against the \r\nchaos of anarchists. We will turn the power of right \r\nagainst the darkness of evil. \r\n I did not come to the office of President, to this \r\nmoment, by design. As my wife once said about \r\nherself, I did not choose this life — it chose me. An \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n19 08-51851 \r\n \r\nextraordinary combination of circumstances brought \r\nme to this moment. It has not been an easy road.  \r\n I spent nine years in prison, in solitary \r\nconfinement, as a hostage to my wife’s struggle for \r\ndemocracy and to our party’s future. I was unjustly \r\nimprisoned under a judicial system manipulated and \r\ncontrolled by the forces of dictatorship. I refused to \r\nbreak under pressure. My years in prison made me a \r\nstronger person and hardened my resolve to fight for \r\ndemocracy and justice. Those years prepared me for \r\nthis moment. \r\n Terror took my wife’s life, but the terrorists \r\ncannot kill my wife’s dream. Her vision, her passion \r\nand her force are now our common task. The Benazir \r\nBhutto doctrine of reconciliation lives on; it guides us \r\nin our endeavours. Her reconciliation is the mantra of \r\nthe new era. I am dedicated to implementing what she \r\nproposed. I wish I could do it at my wife’s side, but \r\nnow I will do it in my wife’s place. \r\n Pakistan will prove wrong all the negative \r\npredictions about its future. We will show the way by \r\novercoming suspicions towards and from our \r\nneighbours and building a future for our people.  \r\n Throughout her life, my wife struggled to make \r\nthe world a better place for our children, the children \r\nof Pakistan and the children of the world. I owe it to \r\nher memory and to all of the martyrs of democracy to \r\ncontinue to do the same until the Bhutto doctrine of \r\nreconciliation is not just her dream but the world’s \r\nreality. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan for the statement just made.  \r\n  Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of the Sudan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof the Sudan. \r\n  Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of the Sudan, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed \r\nTaha, Vice-President of the Republic of the Sudan, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Taha (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is indeed \r\nmy pleasure, on behalf of the leadership, people and \r\nGovernment of the Sudan, to greet the General \r\nAssembly as it meets in its sixty-third session. We wish \r\nits deliberations every success and hope to witness \r\ntangible progress on all the issues and challenges that \r\nmust be given priority by this Organization. We refer, \r\nof course, to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security; realizing the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs); containing the food crisis, poverty, \r\nhunger, climate change and water shortages; and \r\nreactivating the role of the United Nations in a \r\nchanging world.  \r\n We are indeed delighted to see Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann chairing this session. We are \r\nconfident that, with his wisdom, experience and \r\nperspicacity, we may indeed be hopeful and optimistic \r\nthat the international community will realize its \r\nambitions for global development, reconstruction and \r\nprosperity. \r\n I also wish to strongly commend and thank \r\nAmbassador Srgjan Kerim for the competence with \r\nwhich he conducted the work of the sixty-second \r\nsession. We also thank the Secretary-General and his \r\nstaff for the efforts that they continue to deploy in the \r\nservice of the mandate of this Organization. \r\n This session of the General Assembly falls amid \r\nsome very important and particular developments in \r\nthe international and regional spheres. Millions are \r\nlooking forward to a world of peace, stability and \r\nprosperity that respects the common values and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, notably respect for the sovereignty of States, \r\ntheir choices, the peaceful settlement of disputes and \r\njoint cooperation in all fields. \r\n Although we continue to hope for and work \r\ntowards a capable and efficient United Nations and a \r\ncomplete framework for multilateral cooperation that \r\ntakes into consideration the wealth and diversity of the \r\ninternational community, we in the developing \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 20 \r\n \r\ncountries, especially in the African continent, remain \r\nprofoundly convinced of the need to maintain those \r\nobjectives and principles. We recall that our African \r\ncontinent has had a long and difficult journey as a \r\nresult of its backwardness since it broke the yoke of \r\ncolonialism and fought its post-independence wars, \r\nduring which the objectives and aspirations of Africans \r\nto lead a dignified life were forever thwarted by the \r\nso-called lost decades of development and the \r\nunfavourable economic and trade atmosphere. The \r\npolitical and security situation of the African continent \r\nhas made it vulnerable to foreign interventions and \r\nconspiracies that have undermined its stability and \r\nrendered peace a more distant prospect.  \r\n In addition to discussing the various and well-\r\nknown threats and dangers facing the African continent \r\nand all developing nations, I should like to draw \r\nattention to and warn about the danger of the abuse of \r\nwhat is called “universal jurisdiction”. That concept \r\nthat was condemned in July 2008 at the Sharm \r\nel-Sheikh summit, which called on the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly to seriously \r\nexamine the issue and to cancel it. The politicization \r\nand abuse of the aforementioned principle clearly \r\nshows that disregard for and non-compliance with \r\npolitical and professional norms that are guided by the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of \r\ninternational law, together with the application of \r\ndouble standards, pose grave dangers for the region \r\nand beyond, threatening the stability and prestige of \r\nthe institutions of the international order. \r\n Achieving peace and stability in the Sudan has \r\nbeen a firm priority objective of our Government, \r\nwhich has demonstrated its commitment to the option \r\nof peace, as reflected in the historic milestone achieved \r\nwhen we signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \r\non 9 January 2005 in Nairobi. The Agreement, which \r\nended the longest-running conflict on the African \r\ncontinent since the colonial era, was reinforced by the \r\nDarfur Peace Agreement, signed at Abuja, and the \r\nEastern Sudan Peace Agreement, signed at Asmara, \r\nEritrea. \r\n Our efforts to achieve peace have proceeded from \r\nour conviction that peace will create a favourable \r\nenvironment for the development of the Sudan’s vast \r\nagricultural resources and wealth, which in turn will \r\nensure the sustainability of peace. Furthermore, peace \r\nin the Sudan is a strategic goal aimed at reinforcing \r\nstability in neighbouring countries, the region and the \r\ncontinent. Thus, we appeal to all members of the \r\ninternational community, through the Assembly, to \r\nsupport the efforts to achieve peace and stability in the \r\nSudan. By so doing, they will promote, enhance and \r\nguarantee peace and stability in the region and on the \r\nAfrican continent. We must avoid doing anything that \r\ncould negatively affect or jeopardize those efforts. \r\n While our country is firmly committed to \r\nimplementing the provisions of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement, in particular by holding general \r\nelections during the first half of next year and by \r\ncompleting our national programmes for disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration and de-mining, we \r\nhope that the international community will honour its \r\nfinancial commitments, including those pledges \r\nannounced in Oslo in 2005 and in Norway in May \r\n2008. \r\n Here, in view of the difficulties and obstacles that \r\nwe have encountered in implementing the Agreement, I \r\nshould like to recall a principle of Western thought \r\nregarding the difference between words and deeds. We \r\nin the Sudan believe that our desire for the cancellation \r\nof our foreign debt is in accordance with the spirit and \r\nrequirements of peace agreements, since that debt is \r\nhampering our reconstruction efforts. We also call for \r\nthe lifting of the unilateral sanctions imposed against \r\nour country, which defeat the true purpose of a \r\ncomprehensive peace. In that way, the citizens of the \r\nSudan could benefit from the dividends of peace. \r\n The problem of Darfur has been the chief concern \r\nof the people and the Government of the Sudan. No \r\none is more eager than our people to achieve peace and \r\nstability in Darfur, which, after all, is their problem and \r\ntheir responsibility. From this rostrum, we reaffirm our \r\nfull commitment to achieving a peaceful political \r\nsettlement of the crisis in Darfur, one that will enhance \r\nthe ongoing peace process through positive actions. \r\nThese include the implementation of the People of the \r\nSudan initiative, aimed at developing a national \r\nconsensus as to the best way to resolve the issue, as \r\nstated by the President of the Republic during his \r\nrecent important visit to Darfur; the appointment of \r\nMr. Jebreel Basoli, Joint Chief Negotiator, whom we \r\nfully support; the establishment of an Arab-African \r\ncommittee, co-chaired by the Prime Minister of Qatar, \r\nthe Chairperson of the Commission of the African \r\nUnion and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab \r\nStates, to mediate peace negotiations between the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the armed movements in \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n21 08-51851 \r\n \r\nDarfur, in close cooperation and coordination with the \r\nrepresentatives of the African Union and the United \r\nNations; and the implementation of the initiative that \r\nwas supported and welcomed by the African Union, the \r\nLeague of Arab States and the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Sudanese Government of National \r\nUnity sincerely hopes that those efforts will promptly \r\nlead to comprehensive peace and stability in Darfur. \r\n We had hoped that the signing of the Darfur \r\nPeace Agreement on 5 May 2006 as a result of the \r\ngenerous mediation of the African Union would \r\nencourage the movements that had not signed the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement to do so. In \r\nparticular, in order to ensure full implementation of the \r\nAgreement, power-sharing and the establishment of the \r\nTransitional Darfur Regional Authority, male and \r\nfemale citizens of Darfur have been appointed to \r\nexecutive and legislative positions and various \r\narrangements have been put in place to ensure wealth- \r\nand power-sharing and security. \r\n However, as members are all aware, the \r\nmovements that oppose peace have continued to \r\nboycott all the negotiations, undermining the efforts of \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson and Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. The \r\nmovements have continued to reject the peace option \r\nand to choose the military option, not to serve the \r\ninterests of the people of Darfur but to pursue a policy \r\naimed at regime change in the Sudan, as demonstrated \r\nin the military aggression carried out on 10 May 2008 \r\nagainst the Sudanese capital itself. Those movements \r\nwould not have been able to do what they did had they \r\nnot been receiving mixed or wrong messages from \r\nsome circles, since they saw that the non-signatories \r\nwere not being pressured to join the organ of peace, \r\nwhile those who signed the treaty were. That increased \r\nthe intransigence of the non-signatories, threatening \r\nthe chances for peace and the humanitarian conditions. \r\n With regard to peacekeeping — and in \r\naccordance with the principles of positive cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations and the African Union under \r\nthe agreement reached at the high-level understandings \r\nin Addis Ababa on 16 November 2006, which led to the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007) \r\nestablishing the mandate of the joint African Union-\r\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur \r\n(UNAMID) — the Government of the Sudan has \r\nfulfilled its commitments with regard to its role in the \r\npeace process in Darfur and indeed has fulfilled many \r\nother steps. The status of forces agreement has been \r\nconcluded. The mandate was transferred from the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in the Sudan to UNAMID on \r\n31 December of last year. The headquarters have been \r\nbuilt and operational capacities have been established \r\nin the three states of Darfur. Periodic coordination \r\nmeetings between the Government of the Sudan and \r\nthe command of the joint operation have been \r\ndeliberating on all the problems and resolving them.  \r\n On the humanitarian level, the Government of the \r\nSudan remains committed to executing the \r\nhumanitarian communiqué concluded with the United \r\nNations on 28 March 2007, which is being \r\nimplemented in an exemplary manner as a result of the \r\nmatchless follow-up mechanism to track the \r\nimplementation of the humanitarian communiqué and \r\nthe special efforts of the Government to open \r\nhumanitarian corridors in Darfur and to facilitate the \r\ndelivery of humanitarian aid. Once again we renew our \r\ncommitment to that effort. \r\n At a time when the Government of National \r\nUnity has taken giant strides to implement the peace \r\nagreement, with the full support of the President of the \r\nRepublic, the electoral law has been passed and \r\napproved by parliament to usher the Sudan to yet \r\nanother phase of democratic transformation and \r\npeaceful transfer of power through general elections to \r\nbe held in 2009.  \r\n The country is fully mobilized and engaged in \r\nturning over the page of violence and war in Darfur, \r\nand amid those developments came the request of the \r\nProsecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to \r\nthe Pre-Trial Chamber to issue an arrest warrant. An \r\narrest warrant against whom? Against a man who \r\nended the longest war in Africa, a man who brought \r\npeace to eastern Sudan and laid the foundations for \r\npeace in Darfur. That request targeted the leadership of \r\nthe State, the symbol of its sovereignty and dignity, in \r\na failed attempt at political and moral assassination, as \r\nwell as causing delay or erosion of the peace process \r\nfor ulterior motives unrelated to justice or to the \r\nrealization of peace and stability in Darfur, and in a \r\nState that is not a signatory to the Rome Statute.  \r\n Moreover, the actions of the Prosecutor disregard \r\nthe road map agreed upon by the Sudan, the United \r\nNations and the African Union on the basis of the \r\nAddis Ababa understanding in November 2006 and the \r\ninternational conference on Darfur held alongside the \r\nlast session of the General Assembly. The road map \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 22 \r\n \r\nwas further reiterated and endorsed by the Security \r\nCouncil in its resolution 1769 (2007). The road map \r\nwas based on four tracks: rehabilitation and \r\ndevelopment, the peace process as a priority, the \r\npeacekeeping operation and the humanitarian track. \r\nThus the Prosecutor is turning upside down the issue of \r\naccountability, which the Government of the Sudan \r\nsupports and which is already being handled by a \r\ncompetent and effective Sudanese judiciary, and giving \r\nit a completely different character by introducing it \r\ninto the International Criminal Court and destabilizing \r\njustice and peace in the Sudan and the region. It is an \r\nopen invitation to the rebel movements that oppose \r\npeace to stay away from the peace option. The actions \r\nof the Prosecutor seek to influence negatively the \r\nelections to be held in 2009, through which the \r\nGovernment will enter into a new phase of peace and \r\ndemocratic transformation. \r\n From this rostrum, in the name of the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Sudan, who were \r\nunanimous in rejecting that step, I thank and commend \r\nall the active forces of more than two thirds of the \r\ninternational community, which through their regional, \r\ngeographic and political institutions and organizations \r\nhave condemned the measures taken by the ICC \r\nProsecutor and called on the Security Council to rectify \r\nthe situation arising from that action. Here I \r\nspecifically mean the member States of the African \r\nUnion, the League of Arab States, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference, the member States of the African, \r\nCaribbean and Pacific Group of States and other \r\ncountries that have expressed their disapproval and \r\ntheir complete rejection of that step taken by the ICC \r\nProsecutor.  \r\n I would like to assure the Assembly that the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan is making progress in its \r\nresolute and principled goal of achieving lasting peace \r\nand removing the bitterness of war and its legacy in \r\naccordance with the values and principles of the people \r\nof the Sudan and their mores, customs and traditions, \r\nwhich are based on peaceful coexistence, reconciliation \r\nand tolerance. The establishment of peace in Darfur \r\nand in the Sudan and the steps taken by the Prosecutor \r\nof the International Criminal Court are two parallel \r\nlines that can never meet, hence such situations must \r\nbe rectified as soon as possible and there must be a \r\nreturn to the commitment to the political process. \r\n Since the issue of more democratic international \r\nrelations was one of the subjects proposed for the \r\ngeneral debate of this session, our country, like all \r\nother African countries, has been following the efforts \r\nto reform this Organization — especially the Security \r\nCouncil, which is charged with the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and which has \r\nremained as it is since its inception while the entire \r\ninternational arena has been changing. That made \r\nreforming that Council an urgent priority, so that it can \r\nbe more responsive to the aspirations of the developing \r\nnations.  \r\n I am referring specifically to Africa, which has no \r\npermanent representation in the Security Council, \r\nwhose agenda is beset with African issues. Here I \r\nwould like to reiterate that the Sudan is in accord with \r\nthe African position included in the Ezulwini document \r\non the issue of reforming the modus operandi and rules \r\nof procedure of the United Nations so that it can be \r\nmore democratic, transparent, express equitable \r\ngeographic representation of the world’s continents and \r\nreflect the developments that the world has seen since \r\n1945. \r\n Economic and trade developments compete with \r\neach other. The failure of economic structures in many \r\ndeveloping and least developed countries constitutes a \r\nproblem that raises obstacles for the movement to \r\nrealize the MDGs as soon as possible. The current \r\nstructure of the international economy, with its \r\nrestrictive, unfair trade practices and restrictions on the \r\nexports of developing nations, is a negative impact of \r\nglobalization, in addition to the heavy external debt \r\nburden that paralyzes the region’s national economic \r\ndevelopment. Those obstacles are very serious and \r\nretard development, especially in the African continent.  \r\n The United Nations Millennium Summit \r\nemphasized the special position of Africa as a priority \r\nwith regard to international assistance and channels of \r\ncooperation and support through relevant initiatives \r\nlike the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) and other regional, subregional and national \r\ninitiatives.  \r\n Here, let me mention that the Sudan has \r\nimplemented several quick-income projects and several \r\nshort-term projects to benefit vulnerable groups. \r\nRegarding the attainment of MDGs — especially the \r\nalleviation of poverty, the development and support of \r\neducation, health and the fight against diseases like \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n23 08-51851 \r\n \r\nmalaria — the State is still directing its efforts to attain \r\nthose objectives and to realize sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We must take into consideration the \r\npotential of the country and its vast resources, which, \r\naccording to reports of relevant international \r\norganizations, make it capable of helping to solve the \r\nglobal food crisis by providing food for millions \r\naround the world. \r\n National efforts in the Sudan can currently be \r\nseen in the context of efforts to develop and revitalize \r\nthe agricultural sector and to realize a comprehensive \r\ngreen revolution. Here I must emphasize the serious \r\nnegative impact of phenomena like climate change and \r\nenvironmental deterioration, which have constituted \r\nreasons for war and conflict in Africa. The conflict in \r\nDarfur is one practical example of the impact of those \r\nphenomena and how they directly affect the daily lives \r\nand needs of individuals.  \r\n The Sudan, as a party to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \r\nsince 1999, emphasizes the need to put more effort and \r\ncoordination into intensifying multilateral action to \r\nface those phenomena and to achieve a more efficient \r\nsystem for the post-2012 era. Developing nations must \r\nalso participate in dealing with the causes and effects \r\nof climate change. \r\n The Sudan is of the view that developed nations \r\nshould fulfil their commitments to capacity-building \r\nand should provide the financial and technical \r\nresources to support developing nations in facing those \r\nproblems. \r\n The Sudan emphasizes the fact that the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security \r\nrequires, first and foremost, an urgent solution to the \r\nproblem in Palestine and that the situation be dealt \r\nwith in a decisive and serious manner, especially in \r\nview of the tragic situation that the Palestinian people \r\nin the occupied territories are facing. The international \r\ncommunity is called upon today more than any other \r\ntime to put pressure on the occupying authorities to \r\nabide by resolutions of international legitimacy so that \r\nthe Palestinian people may realize their full right to \r\nself-determination and the establishment of an \r\nindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that for \r\nthe United Nations to continue playing its important \r\nrole imposes on us a collective responsibility to find \r\nthe solid will and determination to make the \r\nOrganization a truly collective framework for \r\nmultilateral, international efforts to deal effectively and \r\njustly with international issues and problems. The \r\nUnited Nations must establish clear and transparent \r\npartnerships according to the Charter with regional \r\norganizations in order to realize regional and \r\ninternational peace and security. The Sudan, as a \r\ncommitted and active member of this Organization, \r\nwill remain faithful to the objectives that constitute our \r\ncollective effort.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan for the statement just made.  \r\n Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of the Sudan, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, \r\nPresident of the Government of the Kingdom of \r\nSpain \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Government of \r\nthe Kingdom of Spain. \r\n Mr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, President of \r\nthe Government of the Kingdom of Spain, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency José Luis Rodríguez \r\nZapatero, President of the Government of the Kingdom \r\nof Spain, and inviting him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Zapatero (Spain) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): In a few weeks’ time, it will be 60 years \r\nsince the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights. And here we find ourselves at the \r\nmidpoint in the application of our strategies for the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n The Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nbears witness to the determination to leave us a better \r\nworld than the one known by our fathers’ generation — \r\na generation that suffered, struggled, defeated \r\ntotalitarianism and condensed its aspirations for \r\nfreedom and prosperity in that text. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals reflect the will, no less \r\ndetermined, of our generation to confront extreme \r\npoverty once and for all, so that we may leave to our \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 24 \r\n \r\nchildren a world without millions of human beings \r\nsuffering from hunger and poverty on a daily basis. \r\n Together, the observance of human rights and the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals are \r\nperhaps the most noble aspirations ever envisioned by \r\nhumanity, and the most devoted to the dignity of \r\nindividuals. \r\n Just by that fact alone, we can say that, despite all \r\nof the suffering deliberately caused by human beings \r\nover the last decades, during that time we have learned \r\nand we have made progress. We can feel satisfied that \r\nwe have identified and broadened the horizons of \r\nhuman beings on our planet. We can feel satisfied by \r\nthat, but by no means should we be complacent. \r\n There is no room for complacency because if we \r\nlook at the horizon for the MDGs, as we have for \r\nhuman rights, the conclusion would be the same: the \r\nresults are still far from fulfilling our aspirations, \r\nprecisely because those aspirations retain all of their \r\nvalue, and even grow in value, with the passage of \r\ntime. \r\n Ten years ago, at the commemoration of the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, President Nelson \r\nMandela recalled that poverty is an offence against the \r\nDeclaration and is the result not of any force of nature, \r\nbut rather of the action or non-action by human beings, \r\nin particular those in leadership positions in politics, \r\nthe economy and other areas of human activity. \r\n Aware of that responsibility, eight years ago \r\nMember States undertook the unique effort, in historic \r\nterms, to alleviate poverty for millions of people \r\nworldwide. I wish to make my opinion clear that we \r\nhave not progressed as we should have or as we \r\nplanned. However, the needs are the same or even \r\ngreater than they were when we agreed the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals eight years ago. \r\n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n If we are to attain the Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015, we cannot just sit back. We cannot \r\nblame our failure to meet our obligations on the \r\neconomic situation. We cannot use any circumstance as \r\nan excuse to avoid honouring our commitments. It is a \r\nquestion not only of adhering to irreplaceable ethical \r\nstandards, but of making responsible efforts towards \r\nstability and international equality. \r\n We must also work urgently to establish a new \r\nworld financial order that would prevent the recurrence \r\nof situations like that we are currently experiencing. It \r\nis also urgent that we continue to fight with \r\ndetermination against the hunger and poverty that \r\ncause millions of people to suffer unacceptably and \r\ncontinue to be a source of conflict and migratory \r\npressures that are difficult to control. \r\n I am speaking on behalf of a country — Spain — \r\nthat is making great efforts of solidarity in its \r\ncooperation policies. Over the past four years, Spain \r\nhas been the State with the highest increase in its \r\nofficial development assistance; our goal is to reach \r\n0.7 per cent of our gross national income by 2012. \r\nSpanish society offers that commitment in response to \r\nthe current food crisis. \r\n My country believes that the best way to reaffirm \r\nthe full value of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights and to keep 2015 firmly in view is to strengthen \r\nthe historical connotation of each. That connotation is \r\nnothing less than the exaltation of human dignity as \r\nboth an impregnable wall against arbitrariness and \r\ndespotism and as a curb against extreme poverty. \r\n A few weeks ago, on behalf of the Government of \r\nSpain, I made a proposal that I would like to reiterate \r\ntoday. The year 2015 should be designated as the year \r\nof a universal moratorium on the death penalty. That \r\nwould be a first step towards its abolition. I call upon \r\nrepresentatives of countries that still include capital \r\npunishment in their legal system to support the \r\nmeasure and to participate in a process of reflection on \r\nthe meaning of that punishment inflicted by States. It \r\nmight seen utopian to aspire to achieve the full \r\nenjoyment and universal recognition of human rights \r\nand the eradication of extreme poverty in the course of \r\na single generation, but those goals are not utopian and \r\nnever will be. Utopias are often simply premature \r\ntruths. We must not delay or dismiss them with \r\nresignation or blind selfishness. Moreover, it is only by \r\nsetting off down that road that we can work towards \r\nthe just, secure and cooperative international order that \r\nwe all wish to see. \r\n The effects of the international financial crisis \r\nthat began one year ago are spreading throughout most \r\ndeveloped and less developed economies, and could \r\naffect the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. There is a risk that the poorest countries will \r\nend up suffering even more because of improper \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n25 08-51851 \r\n \r\npractices in the richer countries. The financial crisis \r\nhas conclusively demonstrated the need to reconsider \r\neconomic environments that are immune to regulation \r\nand governmental supervision. We already know what \r\nspeculation in the crucible of deregulation can lead to. \r\nToday, it is more important than ever to stress the role \r\nof institutions and Government in rationalizing the \r\nmarkets and their instrumentality in serving the real \r\nneeds of families, the well-being of individuals and \r\ntheir education, health care and social cohesion.  \r\n At the national level, the State protects markets \r\nfrom their own excesses. The global market lacks \r\nsimilar institutions to develop control and supervision \r\nfunctions. We need to revise the rules and institutions \r\nof the world economy. We need a common vision for \r\nthe establishment of a new international financial legal \r\nsystem. We have to learn from our mistakes, and do so \r\nquickly and in a spirit of cooperation. \r\n My Government would like to contribute actively \r\nto forging that new international financial order. We \r\nwill promote and support an agreement that contains \r\ndefinite commitments to supervision, transparency and \r\nearly warning by national institutions; ensures the \r\nflexible capacity of those institutions to provide \r\nliquidity and countercyclical reserves of capital to the \r\nmarkets in moments of need; and strengthens the role \r\nof international financial bodies. \r\n Prosperity for our peoples is possible only if there \r\nis international peace and security. Peace and security \r\nwill be possible only through effective multilateralism \r\nbased on respect for and the safeguarding of \r\ninternational law. For my country, there is no other way \r\nto imagine international order. Four years ago in this \r\nvery same Hall, I proposed an alliance of civilizations \r\nwith the objective of building bridges between \r\ndifferent cultures and breaking down the walls of \r\nmisunderstanding. Today, I am satisfied to note that the \r\ninitiative promoted by Spain and Turkey has been fully \r\nendorsed by the United Nations, and enjoys the support \r\nof a Group of Friends made up of 90 States and \r\ninternational organizations. \r\n The world can hope for peace only when dialogue \r\nand understanding of basic values that respect diversity \r\nare elevated above intolerance and fundamentalism.  \r\n Spain will continue to assert this conviction in all \r\nforums where our contribution is or can be relevant — \r\nincluding, first and foremost, at the United Nations. We \r\nwill do so not only because it is the best way to stress \r\nthe key desires of Spanish society, but also because we \r\nwant to shoulder our responsibility for bringing about \r\nthe just, secure, caring international order in which we \r\nbelieve.  \r\n The capacity for human progress cannot be \r\nquestioned. The thirst for discovery and innovation, the \r\ndesire to go beyond ourselves, opens the door for \r\nmeeting human needs every day in all areas. It is a \r\nquestion of placing this immense creative force in the \r\nservice of those values on which human dignity is \r\nbased, eliminating arbitrariness, injustice and all forms \r\nof discrimination, starting with those that women have \r\nso unfairly endured throughout history. We cannot \r\nstop; we cannot give up.  \r\n In the United Nations, with a rational attitude, \r\nwith the hope engendered by our common values, we \r\ncan launch an era of world prosperity and unity. For \r\nthat, we need coordination, not unilateral action. \r\nDevelopment must be sustainable and not uncontrolled. \r\nWe need permanent political dialogue. We should not \r\ngive in to old temptations or new cold wars. We have \r\nto eradicate extreme poverty and denounce the \r\nselfishness of the richest. We need the United Nations. \r\nWe need all men and women to know that their dignity \r\nis dependent on the dignity of their peers.  \r\n Above all, hundreds of millions of people in \r\nAfrica, Latin America and Asia need us: that must be \r\nthe basic purpose of our endeavours. Spain is \r\ncommitted to those endeavours and will fulfil its \r\nhistoric duty to eradicate extreme poverty around the \r\nworld. This generation can do it; this generation must \r\ndo it. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, President of \r\nthe Government of the Kingdom of Spain, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Taro Aso, Prime Minister \r\nof Japan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Japan. \r\n Mr. Taro Aso, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 26 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Taro Aso, Prime Minister of \r\nJapan, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Aso (Japan): It is my great honour to stand \r\nhere as the new Japanese Prime Minister — brand new, \r\nreally, as I was designated by the National Diet \r\nyesterday. \r\n(spoke in Japanese) \r\n First, I would like to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his assumption of \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. I extend my \r\nheartfelt appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, former President of the General Assembly, for \r\nhis devoted efforts during his tenure. I wish also to \r\nexpress my profound respect for the tireless leadership \r\ndemonstrated by His Excellency Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon in the management of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Being back in New York, I am reminded of an old \r\nsaying about bankers. It seems that there are only two \r\ntypes of bankers in the world: bankers with short \r\nmemories and bankers with no memories. In finance, \r\nmarket crazes and panics cling together in much the \r\nsame way that shadows follow objects. Crazes \r\ninvariably develop over time, which then give rise to \r\npanic. It was 10 years ago, in September indeed, that \r\nthe world experienced a nightmare in which liquidity \r\nsuddenly dried up. For more than the last quarter \r\ncentury, it seems almost as if crazes and panics have \r\nperformed a never-ending musical rondo every few \r\nyears, with a large number of countries and markets, \r\nnaturally including Tokyo, as their stage. \r\n Tokyo stayed relatively clear-headed during the \r\nmost recent frenzy. However, that said, it could be \r\nargued that that was due to little more than the \r\nunusually long time we had suffered when our \r\nhangover morphed into a debt overhang as a result of \r\nthe previous craze of the 1980s and 1990s. \r\n That rondo continues without end, and so \r\ncertainly humankind will once again hear that very \r\nsame melody in the not-too-distant future. We simply \r\nmust advance inch by inch each time and resolve to \r\nbecome more prudent. Vociferous arguments on the \r\ninternational financial architecture are about to begin \r\nonce again. Japan is eager to contribute its experience \r\nand its knowledge. \r\n In Japan, May is the month for enjoying new \r\ngreen growth, and 7 July is the day on which both \r\nchildren and adults tie strips of paper bearing \r\nhandwritten wishes to bamboo branches hung from the \r\neaves and look to the night sky as they pray for their \r\ndreams to come true. \r\n This year in May, Japan held the Fourth Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development, also \r\nknown as TICAD IV, bringing together some 3,000 \r\nparticipants in the port city of Yokohama. \r\nRepresentatives of 51 nations from Africa gathered, \r\nincluding 41 at the Head of State and Government \r\nlevel. Enthusiastically advocating action “Towards a \r\nVibrant Africa”, that Conference called for support to \r\naccelerate economic growth, to pursue the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in a sustainable manner and to \r\nfoster health, water, sanitation and education in Africa \r\non the basis of human security, a concept that Japan \r\nhas carefully nurtured. Three thousand people renewed \r\ntheir determination to achieve those goals. The \r\nvibrancy of Japan’s fresh green leaves certainly \r\ntouched the heart of each participant. \r\n Then, on 7 July, the day on which we pray for the \r\nrealization of our dreams for the future, the \r\nGovernment of Japan moved the stage to Lake Toyako \r\non our northern island of Hokkaido, opening the G-8 \r\nSummit and a series of outreach meetings. Again, \r\nJapan placed issues regarding development among the \r\nmain themes, and we invited a large number of African \r\nparticipants. That was to ensure that the momentum \r\ngenerated by TICAD IV would be firmly maintained. \r\n By making climate change the theme of another \r\nsummit, we were able to agree to strive to adopt a \r\nglobal long-term target of reducing emissions and to \r\nseek to create, within the United Nations, an effective \r\nframework, in which all major economies would \r\nparticipate in a responsible way. That outcome of the \r\nToyako summit should be regarded as no small matter. \r\nWe aim to realize those goals by no later than the end \r\nof 2009. \r\n I believe that we all associate efforts to address \r\nclimate change with the name of Japan’s ancient \r\ncapital for 1,000 years, Kyoto. Japan has always felt \r\nsome pride on that score. Japan leads the globe in \r\nrequiring the least amount of energy to produce one \r\nunit of gross domestic product. Our technological \r\ncreativity has helped to make that possible. We are \r\neager for the world to make much greater use of it. The \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n27 08-51851 \r\n \r\nsectoral approach also offers a channel through which \r\nJapan aims to contribute to many other countries. \r\n Such was the G-8 achievement just over two \r\nmonths ago with Japan in the Chair. We are now \r\nwitnessing irregularities in the global economy. It is \r\nmy wish, and indeed, my belief, that the pledges of \r\nMay and the dreams of July will be impervious to the \r\nstrong and fast winds that now buffet them. There is an \r\nimportant precondition for both making a vibrant \r\nAfrica even more vibrant and ending global \r\nenvironmental degradation through the efforts of all \r\nnations, namely, the stability of the global economy. \r\n That being the case, the task ahead for Japan, as I \r\nsee it, is already quite clear: it must first invigorate its \r\nown economy. In view of the size of the Japanese \r\neconomy, the second largest in the world, that would \r\ncertainly be the most immediately effective \r\ncontribution that Japan can make. I will work \r\ndeterminedly to that end. Such is my pledge to the \r\nPresident and members of this Assembly. \r\n I should now like to change topic and recount a \r\nsmall event that took place this past summer. It \r\nhappened in a small town on the outskirts of Tokyo. \r\nNine high-school students from abroad arrived there at \r\nthe end of August, setting foot in Japan for their first \r\ntime. There was nothing unusual about those very \r\ntypical-looking high-school student visitors, grimacing \r\nat the unfamiliar food placed before them. However, \r\nthere was one aspect in which those young men and \r\nwomen stood apart from participants in conventional \r\ninvitation programmes. Those high-school students, \r\nfour Palestinians and five Israelis, had all lost at least \r\none relative as a result of terrorism or another aspect of \r\nthe severe situation in the Middle East. \r\n I have just described one of the ongoing efforts \r\nby Japanese civil society to promote reconciliation. \r\nThose high-school students may have no chance to \r\ninteract with each other when they are back home, but \r\nfor the several days that they are in a distant country, \r\ntravelling here and there across the beautiful, verdant \r\nland of Japan in pairs comprising Israelis and \r\nPalestinians, something changes inside them. Those \r\nyoung people come to understand that religion and \r\nethnicity make no difference when it comes to the \r\nsorrow felt at losing a parent, and they often shed tears \r\nupon coming to that realization. Through those tears of \r\nunderstanding they will come to see ties between their \r\nfutures. \r\n For comprehensive peace in the Middle East, \r\nwhat is necessary is the mental groundwork that will \r\nmake such peace possible. By investing in the young \r\nminds of high-school students, Japanese civil society is \r\nworking to foster that groundwork. \r\n As that example suggests, there is no doubt in my \r\nmind that there are certain types of diplomacy that \r\nJapan is uniquely able to undertake. If Israeli drip \r\nirrigation technology were to be introduced in the West \r\nBank of the Jordan River, Palestinian youth would be \r\nable to devote themselves to the production of \r\nvegetables. However, the wall of distrust that separates \r\nthe two sides will not allow that in the immediate \r\nfuture. Here, Japan wishes to act as a catalyst, serving \r\nas a mediator between the two sides.  \r\n Japan is willing to bring its own technologies that \r\nmaximize the potential of drip irrigation. In time, as a \r\nresult of irrigation, the land of the West Bank will \r\nbecome fertile. The agricultural products grown there \r\nwill be processed by Palestinians and transported \r\nthrough Jordan to be laid out fresh in stores in \r\nconsumer regions around the Gulf. The Government of \r\nJapan aims to bring about such a future through its \r\nCorridor for Peace and Prosperity initiative. Here, \r\nJapan continues to provide its technologies and \r\nfunding, but most of all, it aims to be a mediator, \r\nfostering trust. Needless to say, trust is the scarcest \r\nresource of all in the Middle East. \r\n The Government of Japan is currently preparing \r\nto submit a draft resolution on the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons. I believe that there is no one who \r\nquestions the wholehearted commitment of the \r\nJapanese people to that issue. In the same way, I \r\nbelieve it would be superfluous to elaborate on the fact \r\nthat Japan values the activities of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Japan has fielded \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano, Ambassador to the International \r\nOrganizations in Vienna and former Chairman of the \r\nBoard of Governors of IAEA, as a candidate to be the \r\nnext Director-General of IAEA. I strongly urge \r\nmembers to support his candidacy. \r\n Just a moment ago, I touched briefly on the \r\nsignificance of 7 July for Japan. The Heads of State \r\nand Government and their spouses who gathered in \r\nToyako for the G8 Summit wrote their wishes on \r\nbamboo leaves. While the words they chose varied, \r\nthere was not a single person who did not include a \r\nwish for peace. Yet in the short space of time since \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 28 \r\n \r\nthen, there have been incidents at various locations \r\ndisturbing the peace, one after another. \r\n First, regarding the situation in Georgia, I \r\nstrongly expect to see a peaceful resolution of the \r\nissues, based on the principle of territorial integrity; \r\nwith the parties involved, including Russia, acting in a \r\nresponsible manner. And speaking of 7 July, that date \r\nconjures up abhorrent memories in the United \r\nKingdom. We, here in this Assembly, have been newly \r\nincensed at the cruel terrorist attack that took place in \r\nIslamabad five days ago. It has also turned out to be \r\ndifficult to find the path towards improving the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan. There has been no change \r\nwhatsoever in the fact that terrorism constitutes the \r\ngreatest threat to peace and prosperity in the world. \r\n I believe that the international community must \r\ncontinue to be engaged in tenacious efforts to combat \r\nterrorism. Japan has, from the start, been committed to \r\nreconstruction assistance to Afghanistan and we have \r\nmaintained our refuelling activities in the Indian \r\nOcean. I would like to state here that Japan will \r\ncontinue in the future to stand side by side with the \r\ninternational community and participate proactively in \r\nthe fight against terrorism. \r\n Among outstanding issues in the vicinity of \r\nJapan, it goes without saying that the most pressing are \r\nthose concerning North Korea. North Korea has \r\nabducted Japanese citizens, including an innocent \r\nyoung girl named Megumi. Despite pledging to \r\nrelaunch an investigation into the abduction victims, it \r\nhas still not taken action towards fulfilling that pledge. \r\n Regarding its commitment to abandon its nuclear \r\nprogrammes, it is widely known that recently there has \r\nbeen a conspicuous lack of progress. In parallel with \r\nthe action that North Korea would take, I am prepared \r\nto take action towards the resolution of the outstanding \r\nissues of concern between Japan and North Korea and \r\nthe settlement of the unfortunate past tensions between \r\nus, moving Japan-North Korea relations forward. What \r\nwe are waiting for is action by North Korea. I will also \r\ncontinue to pursue the abandonment of North Korea’s \r\nnuclear capabilities and its nuclear weapons within the \r\nframework of the Six-Party Talks. \r\n That leads me to say that China and the Republic \r\nof Korea are each important partners for Japan and \r\ncountries with which Japan must seek to increase \r\nmutual benefits and shared interests. Japan must \r\npromote multilayered cooperation with both of those \r\ncountries as well as with the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations. Together, we must enhance the peace \r\nand prosperity of the East Asian region and beyond — \r\ntowards world peace and prosperity. \r\n As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, I \r\nhave only recently become Japan’s Prime Minister. I \r\nwas designated Prime Minister by the Diet and \r\nappointed by His Majesty the Emperor of Japan barely \r\n24 hours ago, and this is my first engagement since \r\nassuming office. I hope that through my remarks thus \r\nfar you can appreciate why I have taken such pains to \r\njoin you here today. There are numerous points I \r\nwanted to raise. \r\n Looking back, Japan has come a long way, with \r\nthe Japan-United States alliance as a permanent \r\ncornerstone, while steadfastly enhancing relationships \r\nwith neighbouring Asian nations. And I believe that the \r\nPresident of this Assembly and all the other dignitaries \r\ngathered in this Hall will, without exception, \r\nacknowledge that Japan attaches great importance to \r\nthe United Nations and has never once veered from the \r\npath of international cooperation.  \r\n Even though they have suffered setbacks at times, \r\nthe citizens of Japan, who have so vigorously pursued \r\nthe building of the economy, have been guided by a \r\nsingle philosophy until the present day, that peace and \r\nhappiness are most certainly within our grasp through \r\nthe pursuit of economic prosperity and democracy. I \r\nam determined to work in solidarity with countries \r\nholding fundamental values in common and to share \r\nJapan’s experiences with nations strongly needing such \r\nsupport. It is my unwavering view that this is a \r\nresponsibility incumbent on Japan. \r\n It is for these reasons that, speaking on behalf of \r\nthe people of Japan, I must state and reiterate the \r\nabsolute necessity of United Nations Security Council \r\nreform. We must bring about the early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council through an expansion of both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent memberships. Next \r\nmonth, new non-permanent members of the Council \r\nwill be elected, and Japan is standing as a candidate.  \r\n Let me conclude my remarks today by expressing \r\nmy sincere wish for the support of Member States for \r\nJapan’s candidacy. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n29 08-51851 \r\n \r\n Mr. Taro Aso, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.  \r\n \r\n  Address by Sheikh Naser Al-Mohammad \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the State of \r\nKuwait. \r\n Sheikh Naser Al-Mohammad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Sheikh Naser  \r\nAl-Mohammad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Prime Minister of \r\nthe State of Kuwait, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Sheikh Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, it is my pleasure to congratulate the \r\nPresident of the Assembly on his election to preside \r\nover the sixty-third session of the General Assembly \r\nand to wish him every success. We also wish to thank \r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for his successful \r\npresidency of the Assembly during the previous \r\nsession.  \r\n We should also like to express our appreciation \r\nfor the important and outstanding role of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in \r\nsupport of the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthis Organization. \r\n More than a year ago, the world witnessed the \r\nemergence of new international challenges and perils \r\nthat hinder and disrupt efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment in numerous countries, especially \r\ndeveloping countries, and in particular the least \r\ndeveloped among them. Most significant among those \r\nperils are the rise in the cost of food, basic \r\ncommodities and energy, as well as climate change. \r\nThe danger of those challenges lies in their global \r\nimpact; their effects transcend national borders. No \r\nbarrier or artificial restraint can withstand them. They \r\nwill cause the international community to backslide \r\nsignificantly in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Indeed, we have begun to see the negative \r\neffects of those threats in the African continent, which \r\nhas achieved no significant progress in the eradication \r\nof poverty and hunger or in the struggle against such \r\ndangerous infectious diseases as AIDS and malaria. \r\nInstead, these challenges have exacerbated the \r\nsuffering of most African States. \r\n Those challenges, alongside such dangers to \r\nsecurity as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction and human rights violations, pose a \r\nserious threat to international peace and security, and \r\nmeeting them will require prompt, collective, united \r\nand firm action under the umbrella of the United \r\nNations and its various agencies. We must also remain \r\nfirmly committed to the agreements and conventions \r\nthat we have signed and ratified, and implement \r\ntransparently and honestly the resolutions we adopt in \r\ninternational meetings and conferences. \r\n While the State of Kuwait supports the reforms \r\nthat have been adopted in our international \r\nmechanisms, the ongoing changes in and \r\ntransformation of the world order and the emergence of \r\nnew problems and challenges call for continued reform \r\nand the restructuring of many United Nations bodies to \r\naccompany those changes and improve their \r\nperformance. In that regard, we reiterate our demands \r\nfor necessary improvements in the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council, including greater transparency in \r\nits work and an expansion of its membership pursuant \r\nto standards and controls to ensure equity in its \r\nrepresentation and efficiency in the performance of its \r\nduties and responsibilities in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Such reform must also \r\ntake into consideration the legitimate demands of Arab \r\nand Islamic countries and the aspirations and interests \r\nof small States. \r\n The State of Kuwait is pursuing its efforts to \r\nachieve economic and social development and to \r\nimprove the living conditions of Kuwaiti citizens and \r\nalien residents. Kuwait has made good progress in \r\nimplementing the commitments and resolutions of the \r\n2005 World Summit. It has achieved all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, including those on \r\neducation and health, and advanced the role and \r\nempowerment of women in society. Furthermore, in \r\ncarrying out the wishes of His Highness Sheikh Sabah \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of \r\nKuwait, to transform Kuwait into a regional financial \r\nand business centre, the Kuwaiti Government has taken \r\nnumerous important decisions and adopted new \r\npolicies with a view to restructuring the national \r\neconomy and consolidating trade and investment \r\nactivities so as to provide an investment atmosphere \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 30 \r\n \r\nconducive to attracting national and foreign capital \r\ninvestment in such vital economic sectors as energy \r\nand infrastructure. \r\n The State of Kuwait has spared no effort in \r\ncontinuing to provide development assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed, \r\nthrough its official and non-official institutions. That \r\nconsistent approach of Kuwait’s foreign policy \r\nemanates from its conviction that strengthening the \r\neconomies of the developing countries and helping \r\nthem fulfil their development goals will be beneficial \r\nto all. It will broaden the horizons of partnership, \r\ncooperation and solidarity and consolidate the global \r\neconomic and trading systems.  \r\n Since its establishment in 1961, the Kuwait Fund \r\nfor Arab Economic Development has provided grants \r\nand loans to finance infrastructure projects in \r\ndeveloping countries. The gross total amount disbursed \r\nin grants and concessionary loans by the Fund since its \r\nestablishment in 1961 is over $12 billion and has \r\nbenefited more than 100 countries.  \r\n The State of Kuwait continues to meet its \r\nfinancial obligations to international financial \r\ninstitutions and specialized international agencies in a \r\nfull and timely fashion. The Government of the State of \r\nKuwait decided in December last year to allocate \r\n10 per cent of all its contributions and donations to \r\ndisaster-affected countries to specialized international \r\norganizations and agencies working in the field. \r\n In response to the suffering of many developing \r\ncountries in the difficult economic conditions resulting \r\nfrom the increase in food and energy prices, the State \r\nof Kuwait has established the Decent Life Fund, with a \r\ncapital of $100 million, to develop and improve \r\nagricultural production in developing countries. \r\nKuwait has also announced the donation of \r\n$150 million to the Fund, which was established at the \r\nmost recent summit conference of the countries \r\nmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \r\nCountries, held in the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia. That donation was earmarked for research \r\nstudies in the fields of energy, environment and climate \r\nchange.  \r\n The State of Kuwait continues to follow a \r\nbalanced oil policy that takes into consideration the \r\ninterests of consuming and producing countries alike \r\nand seeks to maintain stable oil prices on the world \r\nmarket. However, the unjustified rise in prices, which \r\nis a source of concern, is caused by factors that are out \r\nof the control of the producing countries. They include \r\nspeculation, additional taxes on fuel, and the failure to \r\nbuild new refineries and to upgrade existing ones. The \r\nongoing impact of all of those factors has aggravated \r\nthe economic crises and led to rising rates of inflation \r\nin the developing countries.  \r\n In that context, we express our deep concern over \r\nthe financial crisis in the world markets. We welcome \r\nin that regard the bold steps and actions taken by the \r\nUnited States Government to address the mortgage \r\ncrisis and to mitigate its negative effects not only on \r\nthe United States economy, but also on the economies \r\nof other States around the world. \r\n Achieving sustainable development in the Middle \r\nEast will depend to a large extent on the ability of the \r\ncountries of the region and the international \r\ncommunity to address security issues and challenges \r\nthat are a constant source of tension and instability. In \r\nour desire to achieve peace, we call on the international \r\ncommunity now and in the future to help calm the \r\nhotbeds of tension and instability.  \r\n Any genuine and serious desire to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace must adhere to \r\nthe relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, the \r\nprinciple of land for peace, the road map adopted under \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1515 (2003) and the Arab \r\npeace initiative, leading to the attainment by the \r\nPalestinian people of all their legitimate political rights \r\nand the establishment of their independent State on \r\ntheir own land. We reaffirm our full support for the \r\nsisterly Syrian Arab Republic in recovering its \r\noccupied lands. We also express our support for the \r\nsisterly Republic of Lebanon as it pursues dialogue \r\nbetween all Lebanese parties in implementation of the \r\nagreement signed in Doha, capital of the sisterly State \r\nof Qatar. \r\n The State of Kuwait welcomes the progress \r\nachieved by Iraq in combating terrorism. It commends \r\nthe Iraqi Government’s efforts and diligent endeavours, \r\nwhose fruit include an obvious improvement in the \r\nsecurity conditions in most Iraqi provinces. The State \r\nof Kuwait hopes that those endeavours will continue \r\ntowards comprehensive national reconciliation and \r\nconsensus leading to a democratic, free, secure and \r\nindependent Iraq, living in peace with itself and its \r\nneighbours and respecting its international obligations \r\nand commitments. \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n31 08-51851 \r\n \r\n For its part, Kuwait will spare no effort in \r\nsupporting regional and international efforts to assist \r\nIraq in facing its security, political and economic \r\nchallenges, as well as its efforts to ensure its security, \r\nstability, political independence, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity, and non-interference in its political \r\naffairs. \r\n In that context, the State of Kuwait hopes that \r\ncontacts between the sisterly United Arab Emirates and \r\nthe friendly Islamic Republic of Iran will continue at \r\nall levels in order to find a solution to the conflict over \r\nthe occupied islands of the Emirates in accordance \r\nwith the principles and rules of international law and \r\nthe policy of good-neighbourly relations. \r\n While the State of Kuwait stresses the right of all \r\nStates to produce, develop and use nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes within the framework of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), it \r\ncalls upon the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to \r\npursue its cooperation with the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency in order to dispel the fears and doubts \r\nabout the nature of its nuclear programme. It also urges \r\nIran to address all other outstanding issues. \r\n We call on the international community to \r\ncontinue its efforts and endeavours to seek a peaceful \r\nsolution that would spare our region from crises or \r\nwars that could undermine its security and stability, \r\nand to deal seriously and without favouritism with any \r\ncountry in the region not party to the NPT. That would \r\npave the way for declaring the Middle East a region \r\nfree from weapons of mass destruction of all kinds. \r\n All the peoples of the world yearn to live a free, \r\ndecent life in a safe and stable world in which justice, \r\nequality and a clean environment free of conflict, \r\ndiseases and catastrophes prevail. It is our collective \r\nresponsibility to lay the foundations for a new \r\npartnership, based on fair and balanced rules of justice \r\nand equality, in which each party would assume its \r\nresponsibilities and obligations to realize the \r\naspirations and hopes of our peoples. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Sheikh Naser Al-Mohammad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Han Seung-soo, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Korea \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Korea. \r\n  Mr. Han Seung-soo, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Korea, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Han Seung-soo, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Korea and former President \r\nof the General Assembly, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Han Seung-soo (Korea): I would like to \r\nextend my congratulations to His Excellency \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. I also wish to express my deep appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ndedication to having the United Nations meet global \r\nchallenges in a more effective and timely manner. I \r\nassure them of the Republic of Korea’s full support for \r\ntheir noble endeavours. \r\n As I stand here, I recall those turbulent days \r\nseven years ago when we stood shaken by the terrorist \r\nacts in the morning of 11 September 2001. Throughout \r\nmy presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsixth session, all Member States were united in dealing \r\nwith the grave challenges in the shadow of 9/11. \r\n On 12 September 2001, this Assembly began its \r\nfifty-sixth session by adopting resolution 56/1, strongly \r\ncondemning the terrorist acts and calling for a \r\nconcerted effort by the international community to \r\ncombat terrorism. With the close cooperation that \r\nfollowed, counter-terrorist capacity has been \r\nstrengthened at all levels. \r\n Nevertheless, as we are witnessing in many parts \r\nof the world today, terrorism continues to threaten and \r\ntake the lives of innocent people. As the international \r\ncommunity shares the concern over such an intractable \r\ntrend, it is time for us to renew our commitment to \r\ncompletely root out terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. \r\n This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nfounding of the Republic of Korea. The Republic of \r\nKorea was the first country to have the establishment \r\nof its Government recognized by the United Nations \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 32 \r\n \r\nthrough a General Assembly resolution, back in \r\nDecember 1948. Thanks to the Assembly’s continuous \r\nsupport, the Republic of Korea was able to step into the \r\ntwenty-first century as a full-fledged democracy and \r\nvibrant economy. It is my sincere hope that this special \r\nrelationship will further develop and strengthen in the \r\nyears to come. \r\n Over the past six decades, the United Nations has \r\nstrived for the common good of the international \r\ncommunity and has become ever more relevant to the \r\nwell-being of the present and future generations of \r\nhumankind. It is currently leading the global efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nand is demonstrating strong stewardship in addressing \r\nthe global food and energy crises, as well as climate \r\nchange. \r\n Standing at the midpoint to the MDG target year \r\nof 2015, we realize that, in order to achieve what we \r\npledged, all Member States will have to redouble their \r\ncommitments to the MDGs. But political commitment \r\nalone is not enough. We need solid economic growth \r\nand a coherent strategy to translate our commitment \r\ninto reality. \r\n While the rapid growth experiences of Korea and \r\nother countries have served as a useful reference for \r\nmany developing countries, we should move beyond \r\nthe conventional economic growth approach of “grow \r\nfirst, clean up later”. Rather, what we need is green and \r\npro-poor growth. \r\n Climate change, on which the future of humanity \r\nso critically depends, is now looming larger than ever \r\nas a global challenge. Adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange are threatening the very foundation of the \r\nMDGs, inter alia, by affecting agriculture, upon which \r\nthe livelihood of many in the developing world \r\ndepends, and by increasing climate-related natural \r\ndisasters, which are hitting hard the most vulnerable \r\nbottom billion, as in the case of Typhoon Nargis. \r\n The conventional growth approach based on \r\ncheap fossil fuel is among the factors driving up the \r\nprices of oil and food. As such, we need a new climate-\r\nfriendly strategy for energy and development if we are \r\nto attain the goals of the MDGs while addressing \r\nclimate change. I encourage all agencies of the United \r\nNations to closely cooperate to develop a new road \r\nmap. In that regard, I would like to express my full \r\nsupport for the energetic leadership of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who has been working hard to \r\nplace climate change as our top priority on the global \r\nagenda. \r\n The Republic of Korea recently embraced a low-\r\ncarbon, green growth paradigm. We strongly believe \r\nthat that is and should be the new paradigm for growth \r\nand development of the world in the future. We support \r\nthe global vision of reducing greenhouse gas emissions \r\nby 50 per cent by 2050 and plan to announce next year \r\nour voluntary midterm mitigation goal set for the year \r\n2020. We will also launch the East Asia Climate \r\nPartnership, which will initiate programmes in the \r\namount of $200 million over the next five years to \r\nsupport other countries in making their economic \r\ngrowth compatible with climate change concerns. \r\n In 2002, I attended the World Summit on \r\nSustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, in my \r\ncapacity as President of the General Assembly. \r\nThrough that and other experiences, I have come to \r\nfirmly believe in the importance of high-level \r\ncommitments to strengthening our efforts and political \r\nmomentum on issues concerning the environment and \r\ndevelopment. In that vein, I would like to emphasize \r\nthat a new world summit focusing on climate change \r\nand sustainable development needs to be held in 2012, \r\nnot least to ensure a strong take-off for a post-2012 \r\nclimate regime. \r\n Given that the past three conferences were held in \r\nEurope, America and Africa respectively, it could well \r\nbe Asia’s turn to host the next. Asia is the most \r\npopulous region in the world and is undergoing vibrant \r\neconomic transformation, which makes the sustainable \r\ndevelopment issue all the more relevant. As a country \r\nwell-placed to play a bridging role between developed \r\nand developing nations, the Republic of Korea hopes to \r\nmake a contribution by hosting that conference. \r\n The global food crisis is another factor \r\ncontributing to instability by increasing the population \r\naffected by poverty and starvation. It is also \r\nthreatening to reverse many of the gains we have \r\nachieved thus far in the development field. As the \r\ncauses behind the current food crisis are complex and \r\nvaried, our responses must be comprehensive as well \r\nas timely. \r\n The Republic of Korea has provided \r\nhumanitarian assistance to countries facing food crises. \r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Republic \r\nof Korea, in addition to its assistance to the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, has decided to offer \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n33 08-51851 \r\n \r\n$100 million over the next three years for emergency \r\nfood aid and for assistance to strengthen the \r\nagricultural capacities of developing countries. With \r\nfirst-hand knowledge in agricultural development, \r\nKorea plans to assist in various areas, including \r\nfarming infrastructure, technology and policymaking. \r\n This year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. Over the decades, the United Nations has \r\nplayed an indispensable role in setting international \r\nnorms and principles to ensure all human rights for all. \r\nThis year saw further progress, with the \r\nimplementation of the Universal Periodic Review by \r\nthe Human Rights Council and with the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of Persons with Disabilities taking effect. At \r\nthe same time, we need to redouble efforts to stem the \r\nserious human rights violations that still continue in \r\ncertain regions. The Republic of Korea urges those \r\nhuman rights violators to urgently respond to the \r\ninternational community’s call for dialogue and \r\ncooperation and to follow up with appropriate \r\nmeasures to enhance human rights. \r\n In the area of United Nations reform, it is more \r\ncrucial now than ever that the United Nations operate \r\nefficiently, effectively and responsively. The Republic \r\nof Korea supports all efforts, in particular the \r\ninitiatives taken by the Secretary-General, to make the \r\nSecretariat more accountable, efficient and responsive. \r\n As for the Security Council, in order for it to \r\nbetter fulfil its mandate of maintaining international \r\npeace and security, it needs to be reformed to ensure \r\nthat it is more representative, accountable and efficient. \r\nMoreover, considering the importance of the Security \r\nCouncil, every effort should be made to acquire a \r\ngeneral agreement among all Member States in steering \r\nthe direction of the reform. It should be not an issue of \r\ndivision, but one that unites Member States. \r\n The new Government of the Republic of Korea \r\nhas posited contributing to the international community \r\nas a trusted partner as one of the pillars of its foreign \r\npolicy. To that end, we are strengthening our role in \r\nofficial development assistance and peacekeeping \r\noperations. \r\n Since 2000, our official development assistance \r\nhas increased three times in volume, with assistance to \r\nAfrica increasing threefold in the past three years. We \r\nplan to triple our current official development \r\nassistance to reach over $3 billion by 2015. To better \r\ncoordinate our development cooperation policy with \r\nthe international community, the Republic of Korea \r\nplans to join the Development Assistance Committee of \r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment in 2010.  \r\n The Republic of Korea is also seeking ways to \r\nstrengthen its participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. Currently, we have a 350-\r\nstrong contingent dispatched to the United Nations \r\nInterim Force in Lebanon and are considering \r\nlegislation to facilitate our participation in \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand their delivery systems poses a grave threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. We must strengthen \r\nthe disarmament and non-proliferation regimes, \r\nincluding the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). In that regard, it is crucial \r\nthat the North Korean nuclear issue be expeditiously \r\nresolved. That issue has remained for many years a \r\nthreat to the security of North-East Asia while \r\nseriously undermining the very foundations of the NPT \r\nregime. \r\n The Republic of Korea is making every effort to \r\nresolve the North Korean nuclear issue within the \r\nframework of the Six-Party Talks, under which some \r\nprogress has been made. However, Pyongyang’s recent \r\nmove to suspend the disablement measures and attempt \r\nto reverse the process is highly regrettable. We urge the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to resume \r\ndisablement measures immediately so that the positive \r\nmomentum generated by the Six-Party Talks process \r\ncan be maintained and the denuclearization process can \r\nmove forward. \r\n With a view to developing more mature \r\ninter-Korean relations in a pragmatic and productive \r\nway, the Republic of Korea pursues a policy of mutual \r\nbenefits and common prosperity. As progress is made \r\nin denuclearization, we stand ready to support \r\neconomic development in the North. We are also \r\nwilling to hold discussions with Pyongyang on how to \r\nimplement properly all past inter-Korean agreements, \r\nincluding the Basic Agreement of 1992. President Lee \r\nMyung-bak, in his speech to the National Assembly in \r\nJuly, proposed to fully restore inter-Korean dialogue \r\nand emphasized that we are ready to render our \r\ncooperation to alleviate the food crisis in the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. We look \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 34 \r\n \r\nforward to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\naccepting the offer for dialogue so that real progress \r\ncan be made in inter-Korean relations. \r\n Eventually, I believe that we will see more peace \r\nand prosperity in North-East Asia. The region is \r\nalready a major powerhouse for economic growth in \r\nthe world. With the peaceful resolution of the North \r\nKorean nuclear issue, countries in the region will be \r\nable to accelerate cooperation to make North-East Asia \r\nmore stable and future-oriented. Undoubtedly, that will \r\nin turn contribute greatly to the peace and prosperity of \r\nthe world. \r\n Currently, the international community is \r\ngrappling with the grave financial turmoil that \r\nthreatens to spread worldwide. It has even been feared \r\nthat the turmoil could lead to a recession of the \r\nmagnitude of the Great Depression of the 1930s. \r\nWithout a doubt, the current instability in the financial \r\nmarket could have a devastating, domino-like impact \r\non the real economy of this globalized world. \r\n We have to be careful, however, not to rush into \r\nprotectionist policies either for fear of uncertainty or \r\nout of self-interest. There are hard-learned lessons \r\nfrom the Depression of the 1930s: the “beggar thy \r\nneighbour” policy and the policy of raising tariffs to \r\nprotect particular industries harmed the world \r\neconomy. Therefore, I strongly believe that any \r\nsolution should be based on an even closer cooperation \r\nwithin the international community and the open \r\nmarket economy. \r\n Today, the expectations placed upon the United \r\nNations by the international community are higher than \r\never. However, what the United Nations can achieve \r\ncannot be greater than the sum of all our individual \r\nachievements unless there are synergistic effects. \r\nTherefore, all of us, each and every Member State, \r\nshould not only do our best in carrying out our \r\nresponsibilities, but should also be willing to help and \r\nreach out to others. Only by doing so can this global \r\nbody live up to and even exceed the expectations of the \r\ninternational community. To that end, the Republic of \r\nKorea will faithfully do its part. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Korea for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Han Seung-soo, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Korea, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by His Royal Highness Prince Haji \r\nAl-Muhtadee Billah, Crown Prince of \r\nBrunei Darussalam \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Crown Prince of Brunei \r\nDarussalam. \r\n His Royal Highness Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee \r\nBillah, Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Royal Highness Prince Haji \r\nAl-Muhtadee Billah, Crown Prince of Brunei \r\nDarussalam, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah (Brunei Darussalam): \r\nPlease accept my expression of sincere appreciation to \r\nour outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, and my warmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. Brunei \r\nDarussalam wishes him every success in the coming \r\nyear and we offer him our full support. \r\n My congratulations also go to the Government \r\nand people of Nicaragua. I offer them my very best \r\nwishes for peace, happiness and prosperity. That is a \r\nwish, of course, that we also offer all our fellow \r\nmembers. We very much enjoy working with them, \r\nsharing experiences, voicing concerns and hearing each \r\nother’s thoughts and ideas. I say that because the \r\ncoming year is a very special one for Brunei \r\nDarussalam. In September of next year, we celebrate \r\nthe twenty-fifth anniversary of our membership in the \r\nUnited Nations. We thank the Organization and fellow \r\nmembers for giving us the opportunity to play a part in \r\na world we all share. \r\n The global challenges we now face demand that \r\nevery nation, big and small, work together. That is why \r\nwe will offer whatever we can to support this world \r\nOrganization. We will also support all its efforts to \r\naddress political, economic and social concerns. We \r\nwill help with recovery from natural disasters. We will \r\njoin fellow Members in protecting not only the \r\nenvironment but also the cultures of small societies \r\nlike our own. We will respect the values of the various \r\nfaiths held by the people this Organization represents. \r\n In more specific terms, that is why Brunei \r\nDarussalam strongly supports the role of the United \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n35 08-51851 \r\n \r\nNations in the Quartet working to establish a just and \r\nlasting peace in the Middle East. It is why we ask the \r\nWorld Trade Organization to recognize the impact its \r\nwork has on the stability of small, fragile societies. We \r\nask its strong and influential members not to give up \r\nthe search for a fair formula for an equitable world \r\ntrading system acceptable to all nations. \r\n That is also why we acknowledge the work of the \r\nSecretary-General with the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to help our neighbour \r\nMyanmar recover from the terrible effects of Cyclone \r\nNargis this year. It is the reason behind our work with \r\nour neighbours in Indonesia and Malaysia to conserve \r\nthe priceless heritage of the Borneo rainforests by \r\nplacing over half our territory under environmental \r\nprotection in the heart of Borneo projects. It is why we \r\naffirm the right of all small nations and fragile \r\nsocieties, with all the values they uphold, to continue \r\ntheir way of life with security today and hope for the \r\nfuture. It is why we have supported worldwide \r\ndialogue between faiths to promote tolerance and \r\nrespect for each other’s deepest beliefs. \r\n I offer this appreciation and support for a \r\nparticular reason. A new generation of international \r\nleaders is slowly beginning to shape the future. It is my \r\nprivilege here to speak not only on behalf of all our \r\npeople, but especially on behalf of that new generation \r\nin our country. The twentieth century is, indeed, \r\nhistory. The twenty-first century is plainly here, \r\ncreating its new set of internal and external dynamics. \r\nWe clearly recognize that in my region. That is why \r\nASEAN’s leaders have signed a new charter. We and \r\nour fellow members of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC) have acknowledged that fact by \r\namending the OIC charter and accepting the far-\r\nreaching objectives of the Makkah programme of \r\naction. \r\n Underlying both those moves is the deep desire of \r\nleaders who are passing the baton to their successors to \r\nensure that their people have hope and confidence in \r\nthe future by being given the chance to join the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Our people must be able to participate to \r\nthe fullest. The new generation of leaders must have \r\nthe opportunity to help them do so. We have to provide \r\nthat confidence; by that I mean the confidence that \r\ncomes from education, modern training, health care \r\nand the knowledge that their culture, values and faith \r\nare safe.  \r\n If there is one broad lesson to be learned from the \r\nsecurity crises that have marked the start of the \r\ncentury, it is that security is not an abstract concept, \r\nnor is it simply the traditional tasks of upholding the \r\nlaw and fighting crime. At its heart, it is a deeply felt \r\nfeeling of unfairness. What we are asking for is the \r\nchance to address those causes at a very basic level. \r\n In that task, we therefore turn to the United \r\nNations for help. We deeply acknowledge the work of \r\nthe United Nations agencies in the field and their \r\nexpert staff and selfless volunteers. In particular, we \r\nthank the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO). We see the success of \r\nboth of these organizations as essential to providing \r\nour people with the confidence I have mentioned.  \r\n In Brunei Darussalam, we had the privilege of \r\nhosting our first UNESCO science and technology \r\ncamp in 2006 and we have been deeply impressed by \r\nthe agencies’ relevance to the needs of ordinary people \r\ntrying to meet the challenges of the modern world. We \r\nespecially support the commitment of UNESCO to the \r\nprocess of dialogue and negotiation as the only lasting \r\nmeans of resolving confrontation, no matter how \r\npainstaking the process may be at times. In similar \r\nfashion, we have also long supported the invaluable \r\nwork of WHO. We and our neighbours have greatly \r\nbenefited from the exceptional international research, \r\nadvice and technical assistance that this organization \r\nhas constantly offered, and for which we are all most \r\ngrateful. \r\n I have briefly outlined Brunei Darussalam’s \r\nsupport for the United Nations and its current \r\nobjectives. Above all, we are committed to the work of \r\nits agencies as they attempt to help us all achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. I have spoken of how \r\na new generation of leaders can offer their people the \r\nhope that comes from confidence in the future. The \r\nUnited Nations is the organization that gives us a fair \r\nchance to deliver on this hope. That is all we ask, \r\nbecause for us the twenty-first century presents a \r\ndifficult journey, and the United Nations is the \r\ncompass that directs us towards a hopeful future. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Crown Prince of Brunei \r\nDarussalam for the statement he has just made. \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 36 \r\n \r\n  His Royal Highness Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee \r\nBillah, Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Kevin Rudd, Prime \r\nMinister of Australia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Australia. \r\n  The Honourable Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister of \r\nAustralia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Kevin \r\nRudd, Prime Minister of Australia, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Rudd (Australia): I would like to \r\ncongratulate Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. The Australian delegation looks forward to \r\nworking closely with him throughout the session. \r\n We gather together at a time of great challenge to \r\nthe international system — a challenge that reminds us \r\nafresh that we live in a world where our \r\ninterdependence is now greater than at any time before, \r\nan interdependence that therefore demands our \r\ninternational cooperation now more than at any time \r\nbefore. \r\n There are many who criticize the United Nations. \r\nAnd those of us who know this institution well know \r\nthat it is not immune to criticism. But those who argue \r\nagainst this Organization advance no credible argument \r\nas to what should replace it. Whatever its \r\nimperfections, the United Nations represents a \r\nnecessary democracy of States — States who resolved, \r\nout of the carnage of the last world war, that \r\ncooperation should always be preferred to conflict, that \r\nour national interests are invariably best served by the \r\nsimultaneous prosecution of the international interest, \r\nand that the purposes of our common humanity should \r\nprevail over the narrow interests of the few. \r\n When the nations of the world met in San \r\nFrancisco in 1945, the United Nations was conceived \r\nas a bold experiment — one that ran contrary to the \r\ngrain of the international order that had preceded it, \r\nwhere conflict was the norm and cooperation the \r\nexception; one in which the international community, \r\nfor the first time, began to imagine how through an \r\ninternational institution we could not just protect the \r\nsovereignty of States, but equally advance the \r\nprotection of peoples and the dignity of individuals. \r\n Beyond that, we began to advance the idea that \r\nthrough the other great international institutions — the \r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \r\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \r\nand the International Labour Organization (ILO) — we \r\ncould fashion an international economic order that \r\nrecognized the unfolding reality of economic \r\ninterdependence.  \r\n These were the ideals we set for ourselves more \r\nthan half a century ago. And while the history of our \r\nachievements since then has been mixed, the ideas and \r\nthe ideals on which these institutions were constructed \r\nnonetheless remain as valid now as they were back \r\nthen. \r\n The failures that we have seen in recent times do \r\nnot lie in the institutions alone. The failure lies more in \r\nthe poverty of our political will to animate those \r\ninstitutions to discharge the purposes for which they \r\nwere created. And that is our collective responsibility. \r\n The global financial crisis of today presents us \r\nafresh with a critical opportunity to act \r\ncomprehensively and collectively for the long term, \r\nrather than selectively and separately for the short. In \r\nthe post-war period, the quantum of financial \r\ninstitutional failure seen these last weeks has been \r\ngreat. The quantum of government intervention in \r\nfinancial markets has been significant. The quantum of \r\nthe impact by one market on another has been \r\nunprecedented. What we have seen in financial markets \r\nshould bring home to us all that the central organizing \r\nprinciple of this twenty-first century is interdependence. \r\n For the century just past, interdependence may \r\nhave been one option among many. For the century that \r\nis to come, there is no longer an alternative. \r\nInterdependence is not the expression of sentimental \r\nidealism. Instead, it is a recognition of the new realism \r\nof our current times, which represents the cumulative \r\nimpact of the globalization of our engagement with \r\neach other over many decades. Through unprecedented \r\ntrade flows, unprecedented investment flows and \r\nunprecedented financial flows, we now see the \r\nglobalization of our economy; the globalization of \r\nsecurity, arising from the searing impact of \r\n11 September when the obscenity visited on this great \r\ncity caused us all to conclude that terrorism was the \r\nenemy of all civilized humanity, not just of some \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n37 08-51851 \r\n \r\nnations; and the globalization of the environment, as \r\nwe have come to recognize that carbon emissions from \r\none part of the planet affect all parts of the planet and \r\ntherefore radically affect the future of the planet itself. \r\n What all these things tell us is this: \r\ninterdependence is the new realism of this twenty-first \r\ncentury. And unless as a community of nations we rise \r\nto this new challenge, our future is bleak indeed. \r\n The global financial crisis is a call to the global \r\ncommunity to act. Financial markets are a public good. \r\nThe stability of global financial markets is a public \r\ngood. If Governments fail to protect this public good, \r\nthen those who suffer are the working people of the \r\nworld, whose jobs, whose homes and whose standard \r\nof living depend on it. \r\n It is Governments rather than speculators that \r\nhave the central responsibility for determining the rules \r\nthat govern the way markets work. A decade ago, the \r\nglobal economy and global financial markets were \r\nbuffeted by the Asian financial crisis, and as a global \r\ncommunity we resolved that we would act to reduce \r\nthe risk of such systemic crises in the future. The \r\nproblem is, a decade on, that systemic lessons were not \r\nlearned. \r\n Now we face a financial crisis of truly global \r\nproportions. We must therefore ask ourselves three \r\nquestions: What went wrong? What needs to be done \r\nnow to fix the problem of financial market instability \r\nfor the long term? And most critically, how do we \r\nmarshal the political will to do so? \r\n First, what went wrong? There has been a failure \r\nof internal governance within financial institutions. \r\nThere has also been a failure of external oversight. \r\nRegulators have not always recognized the systemic \r\nrisk posed by significant financial institutions. \r\n So what must now be done? \r\n The immediate task is to rebuild confidence in \r\nthe financial system by ensuring that central banks \r\nprovide adequate liquidity, by enabling the \r\nrecapitalization of critical financial institutions and by \r\nensuring their continued solvency. Over the longer \r\nterm, the challenge is to reform financial markets and \r\nregulatory systems so as to reduce the chances of these \r\nevents repeating themselves in the future. To this end, \r\ntogether with other States, we would argue that the \r\nfollowing reform programme be implemented. \r\n First, systemically important financial institutions \r\nshould be licensed to operate in major economies only \r\nunder the condition that they make full disclosure and \r\nanalysis of balance sheet and off-balance sheet \r\nexposures. Systemically important financial institutions \r\nare not just commercial banks but can include \r\ninvestment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds \r\nand financial clearing houses. \r\n Which institutions are systemically important will \r\nvary in a given country over time. The central bank in \r\neach country should have responsibility for the \r\nstability of the financial system. That should be \r\nembedded in globally agreed best-practice standards \r\nfor financial regulation and should be assessed by the \r\nIMF.  \r\n Secondly, we need to ensure that banks and other \r\nfinancial institutions build up capital in good times as a \r\nbuffer for bad times, using predictable rules. \r\nSupervisory frameworks need to be countercyclical, \r\nnot pro-cyclical. The Basel rules need to address this. \r\n Thirdly, financial institutions need to have a clear \r\nincentive to promote responsible behaviour rather than \r\nunrestrained greed. Regulators should set higher capital \r\nrequirements for financial firms that have executive \r\nremuneration packages rewarding short-term returns or \r\nexcessive risk taking. Again, the Basel rules need to \r\naddress this. \r\n Fourthly, supervisory systems must be compatible \r\nwith accounting principles that reflect reasonable \r\nassessments of the value of assets over time. We need \r\nto make sure that accounting rules foster a more \r\nmedium-term perspective and that they do not \r\nencourage institutions to believe that risk is low merely \r\nbecause current asset prices are high or recent asset-\r\nprice volatility has been low. The Basel rules also need \r\nto address this. \r\n Fifthly, the IMF should be given a strengthened \r\nmandate for prudential analysis. Conservative and \r\nconsistent prudential standards should be applied to all \r\nfinancial institutions of systemic significance. \r\nFurthermore, the IMF and the Financial Stability \r\nForum should develop early warning systems that \r\nsignal impending institutional vulnerabilities and \r\nprovide advice on remedial policies. Collectively, those \r\ninstitutions have led the development of the initiatives \r\nthat represent the core of the financial-market reform \r\nagenda that I have just described. However, those \r\ninstitutions are, by their very nature, bureaucratic, and \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 38 \r\n \r\nthe reform processes they initiate are constrained by a \r\nlack of political authority.  \r\n That brings me to the third question arising from \r\nthe current crisis: how are we to go about \r\nimplementing this reform agenda for the long term? \r\n What is required is political will, exercised \r\nthrough ministerial forums working in cooperation \r\nwith the IMF, the Financial Stability Forum and the \r\nGroup of Twenty (G20). The G20 is well placed to \r\nprovide the political authority to have such actions \r\nimplemented urgently and comprehensively. In that \r\ncontext, Australia will work intensively with the \r\nforthcoming Chairs of the G20 — in particular the \r\nUnited Kingdom in 2009 — to ensure that financial \r\nstability is at the centre of the work programme and to \r\ninitiate arrangements to strengthen G20 input into \r\nshaping the work of the IMF and the Financial Stability \r\nForum and the implementation of agreed outcomes. \r\n At their meeting in November, the G20 finance \r\nministers should review the progress made in adopting \r\nthe current Financial Stability Forum \r\nrecommendations, reinforce the agreed deadlines for \r\nfinalizing their implementation and agree with the \r\nForum on a clear timetable for the action plan. \r\n As countries with systemically important \r\neconomies, G20 members should demonstrate their \r\ncommitment to best-practice financial regulation and \r\ndisclosure by providing better information regarding \r\nthe stability of their domestic financial systems and \r\ncross-border exposures to the IMF and the Financial \r\nStability Forum. The IMF and the Financial Stability \r\nForum should provide regular scenario analysis to the \r\nG20 to facilitate clear engagement on the risks facing \r\nthe global financial system. Such analysis should be \r\nincluded in an enhanced version of the IMF’s Global \r\nFinancial Stability Report. \r\n The purpose of this reform agenda is to provide a \r\nreal political mandate for our international regulatory \r\ninstitutions to do their job in defending the integrity of \r\nthe international financial system. \r\n One of the greatest challenges we face is climate \r\nchange and the threat it poses to the environment. In \r\nDecember last year, after many years of delay, \r\nAustralia ratified the Kyoto Protocol. We are \r\ndetermined to be part of the solution to climate change, \r\nnot just a part of the problem. We have acted to begin \r\nthe process of developing a comprehensive emissions \r\ntrading or carbon pollution reduction scheme to bring \r\ndown carbon dioxide emissions over time. We will also \r\nimplement a national energy efficiency strategy as well \r\nas a renewable energy strategy. Developing and \r\ndeploying new technologies will also be part of our \r\nresponse to climate change. \r\n The Australian Government has decided to \r\nestablish a global centre to drive the demonstration and \r\ncommercialization of carbon capture and storage \r\ntechnologies. Building on existing national and \r\nregional initiatives, that project will bring together the \r\nbest researchers in the world to develop the best \r\ntechnology to apply. As the world at present is \r\nplanning to generate 45 per cent of its electricity from \r\ncoal by 2030, we can no longer afford to delay acting \r\non such technology. Australia invites all Governments \r\nand corporations of goodwill to participate in the \r\nGlobal Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. \r\n The United Nations and we, its Member nations, \r\nhave a responsibility to protect the nations and peoples \r\nof the world. We must protect people from terrorism, \r\nand that must include a commitment to support those \r\nnations on the front lines of the struggle. Australia is \r\nworking closely with the Government of Afghanistan \r\nand with our global partners to bring security and \r\nstability to that country. We can never again allow it to \r\nbecome a haven for terrorists. \r\n Australia is also an active contributor to global \r\nefforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. We continue to urge nations to sign and \r\nratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty so \r\nthat it can enter into force. \r\n We remain concerned that States such as Iran and \r\nNorth Korea continue to defy the international \r\ncommunity and to fail to comply with demands for a \r\nfull declaration and accounting of their nuclear \r\nprogrammes. Their actions are undermining the global \r\nconsensus on containment of the spread of nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\n This year, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) celebrates its fortieth \r\nanniversary. As a middle Power and a long-standing \r\nmember of the NPT, Australia is committed to working \r\nwith other nations towards the goal of the eventual \r\nabolition of nuclear weapons. Australia, together with \r\nour close friend and partner Japan, has established an \r\nInternational Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation \r\nand Disarmament to create the political and policy \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n39 08-51851 \r\n \r\nconsensus necessary to elicit a real result on  \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament in advance of the \r\n2010 NPT Review Conference. \r\n The United Nations own security machinery must \r\nalso be effective. The Security Council needs reform. \r\nAustralia supports expansion of its permanent \r\nmembership to reflect changes in the world since 1945, \r\nand our nation will be a candidate for a non-permanent \r\nseat for the 2013-2014 term. Australia once again \r\nwishes to play its part in advancing the international \r\nsecurity order. \r\n Prosperity comes from economic growth. It \r\ncomes from nations trading with one another. That is \r\nwhy it is so important that we conclude the Doha \r\nRound of world trade talks this year. It is why we must \r\nalso implement the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nconsistent with our solemn commitment in this place at \r\nthe dawn of this millennium. \r\n Progress in achieving the Goals has been mixed. \r\nWe need to redouble our efforts to reduce poverty, to \r\nprovide education for children and to ensure that \r\npeople in the developing world have access to health \r\ncare. Australia is committed to increasing its official \r\ndevelopment assistance to 0.5 per cent of its gross \r\nnational income by 2015. Australia now resolves to do \r\nmuch more — much, much more — to make poverty \r\nhistory. It is unforgivable that poverty and conflict, \r\nsuch as those in Darfur, continue to claim the lives of \r\ninnocents in the face of inaction by Governments.  \r\n Development is also about protecting human \r\nrights. Sixty years ago, this body adopted the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. We must commit afresh \r\nto protecting the rights that that charter identifies.  \r\n As nations, we should also commit afresh to \r\nrighting past wrongs. In Australia, we began that \r\nrecently with the first Australians, who have the oldest \r\ncontinuing culture in human history. This year, on \r\nbehalf of the Australian Parliament, I offered an \r\napology to Indigenous Australians for the wrongs that \r\nthey had suffered in the past. That was the right thing \r\nfor Australia to do. \r\n Our membership in the United Nations is a key \r\npillar of our foreign policy. Our priorities are regional, \r\nbut our interests are global. We work with partners \r\naround the world to meet shared challenges. Through \r\nour membership in the United Nations, we are \r\ncommitted to using creative middle-Power diplomacy \r\nto help overcome the great challenges of our age — \r\nchallenges that are beyond the power of individual \r\nnation-States to resolve, that can be overcome only \r\nthrough unprecedented cooperation between States. \r\nThat is because the problems that we seek to solve in \r\nthis Hall and through the organs of the United Nations \r\ntouch every one of our peoples. To advance prosperity \r\nand stability at home, we must advance prosperity and \r\nstability around the globe. \r\n Australia was one of the founding Members of \r\nthe United Nations. Our Foreign Minister at the time, \r\nHerbert Evatt, made a significant contribution at the \r\nSan Francisco Conference, particularly on the part of \r\nsmall and medium-sized countries. He ensured that the \r\nrole of the General Assembly was protected in the \r\nstructure of the Organization as a whole. \r\n Sixty years ago this week, he was elected \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its third session. \r\nEvatt was a patriotic Australian. Evatt was equally a \r\npassionate internationalist. Sixty years later, this \r\ninstitution, together with other international institutions \r\nof our current order, have yet to realize the vision of \r\nthose who founded it. Yet the need today, in this age of \r\nunprecedented global interdependence, is greater than \r\never before. \r\n And so it falls to this generation to now summon \r\nthe political faith and to exercise the political will \r\nnecessary to act for the common purposes of the planet \r\nwe all share. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nAustralia for the statement he has just made. \r\n  The Honourable Mr. Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister \r\nof Australia, was escorted from the rostrum.  \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Albert Pintat, Chief of the \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Chief of the Government of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra. \r\n  Mr. Albert Pintat, Chief of the Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Albert Pintat, Chief of \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 40 \r\n \r\nthe Government of the Principality of Andorra, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Pintat (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): “I am committed to \r\ntruth, not to what is established,” said Gandhi. The \r\nMillennium Development Goals, which seek between \r\nnow and 2015 to eradicate extreme poverty, achieve \r\nuniversal primary education, promote gender equality, \r\nreduce infant mortality, fight the spread of such \r\ndiseases as HIV/AIDS and malaria, and guarantee \r\nenvironmental sustainability, are a challenge to us all, \r\nindividually and collectively. Each human being is \r\nunique and respect for others must be both universal \r\nand imperative. \r\n The world is paradoxical. We meet here during \r\nthese weeks to speak of the food crisis and famine in \r\nthe world, and we do so 63 years after having set in \r\nmotion actions and structures within the framework of \r\nthe United Nations to eradicate such phenomena. \r\n In 2008, well into the twenty-first century, of the \r\n2.5 billion poor people living in the countries of the \r\nSouth, 950 million live in conditions of extreme \r\npoverty. The forecasts of the International Fund for \r\nAgricultural Development indicate that, by 2025, the \r\nworld will have 2 billion more people living in \r\nconditions of extreme poverty. \r\n In one year, the world has been confronted, as it \r\nwas in the last century, by mass movements of \r\npopulations driven by hunger. The Governments of the \r\nwealthiest countries, international agencies and \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) stand helpless \r\nbefore the worsening malnutrition and social tensions \r\nthat have resulted. \r\n The Secretary-General declared in his 2007 report \r\non the Millennium Development Goals that the world \r\ndoes not want more promises. However, reality in its \r\ncrudest aspect has put us through disturbances in recent \r\nmonths caused by people who are suffering famine in \r\nvarious countries. On Tuesday, the President reminded \r\nus in his opening speech of the perils of our current \r\nsituation. We face a global financial crisis, a global \r\nenergy crisis, a global food crisis and climate change. \r\nFaced with this situation, it is inevitable that we ask \r\nourselves the questions: What did we do wrong? What \r\nis it that does not work? \r\n The prices of basic food products have risen by \r\n50 per cent in one year, and a group of United Nations \r\nexperts has determined that the price of goods around \r\nthe world has risen by 30 per cent since January 2008. \r\nIf we take into account that there are 1.4 billion people \r\nliving on less than $1.25 a day, there are far too many \r\npeople living in the world today in extremely \r\nprecarious conditions, with no access to schools, \r\npotable water or basic health care and hygiene. \r\n Some experts say that the food crisis is the result \r\nof the failure of development policies that were \r\nadopted to encourage economic and social progress in \r\ncountries classified as poor. Those countries often have \r\nsubstantial natural resources and could produce basic \r\nproducts, such as cereals, but reality is obstinate and \r\nthe fact is that two thirds of developing countries are \r\nnet importers of food products. \r\n Alfred Sauvy, the economist and sociologist, said \r\nthat the milestone of the economy is not labour but \r\nconsumption. That is the source of one of the principal \r\ncurrent problems. Consumer goods are scarce and \r\ndemand exceeds supply. The Director-General of the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations (FAO), Jacques Diouf, forecasts an increase of \r\n56 per cent in the cost of imports of cereals for the \r\nmore disadvantaged countries, but he also forecasts an \r\nincrease of 53 per cent for the European countries. \r\n The current crisis is closely related to the \r\ngeographical distribution of productivity. Perhaps \r\nproduction should be increased in the places where \r\npeople are suffering famine and less surplus sent from \r\ncountries with more resources, since it contributes to \r\nincreasing the dependency of the poor countries. In that \r\nrespect, we agree with the decision of the World Bank \r\nto double its loans for agriculture to Africa, with a \r\nprovision of $800 million for 2009. \r\n At the same time and in order to correct the \r\ndistortions that have been created in the markets, the \r\nliberalization of agricultural markets must be \r\naccompanied by measures of support for small local \r\nfarmers so as to avoid the temptation of giving up \r\nproduction in favour of importing foreign food \r\nproducts. In fact, liberalization would have to be \r\nreinvented. Rather than serving as a common pattern \r\nfor all countries, it would have to be applied according \r\nto the specific circumstances of each country, while the \r\npros and cons are analysed with caution. \r\n On the other hand, the subject of agricultural \r\nsubsidies has not been resolved definitively, nor has \r\ntrue freedom of trade, which would serve to help the \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n41 08-51851 \r\n \r\ncountries that need it most, been established. \r\nLiberalization would also have to involve an increase \r\nin productivity and the development of human \r\nresources, basic infrastructures, access to technology \r\nand knowledge including respect for the environment. \r\nIn other words, it would have to contribute to \r\nsustainable development, as indicated in the Doha \r\nOutcome Document of July 2008. \r\n The current crisis shows the vulnerability of the \r\npresent system. In that regard, without ignoring hard \r\nrealities, Andorra fully shares the approaches agreed in \r\nRome in June during the High-Level Conference on \r\nWorld Food Security: the Challenges of Climate \r\nChange and Bioenergy. Since 2005, the Government of \r\nAndorra has worked on development cooperation with \r\nall of the major international bodies, vulnerable \r\ncountries at their request, NGOs and civil society. \r\n In the current context and in accordance with the \r\ncall from world leaders, major international actors and \r\ninternational specialized and regional organizations, \r\nwe have assisted the most affected countries through \r\nfinancial contributions to FAO and NGO initiatives. \r\nWe also cooperate on support for agricultural trade and \r\nproduction in Burkina Faso, Colombia and Morocco \r\nthrough NGOs active in the field. For that reason, we \r\nendorse the future options being used to maintain \r\nbiological diversity, sustainable forestry practices and \r\nthe adaptation of new technology that can help to \r\npromote ecological balance and slow the effects of \r\nclimate change. \r\n Demographic growth on a planet that already has \r\nmore than 6.7 billion inhabitants; chemical and \r\nindustrial pollution; ill-adapted land use; desertification \r\nand water; the interaction of animal, vegetable and \r\nhorticultural species; international trade and the \r\nmovements of peoples are all destabilizing factors that \r\nare now upon us and very real. We have to address \r\nthem with all the means available to us. Guaranteeing \r\nfood for everyone on our planet is basic, essential and \r\nvital. Sixty-three years ago we thought that today, in \r\nthe twenty-first century, this would be a fact, an \r\noutdated concept, a matter achieved, the success of our \r\ndreams. Sadly, we were wrong. Now, we need to be \r\nstrong. To keep going and face up to the most \r\npessimistic forecasts which warn us of the failure of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n We have made the diagnosis, we are aware that \r\nthe policies we have encouraged in recent decades have \r\nnot fulfilled our expectations. But we still have time to \r\nrectify this and for this reason I would like to \r\ncongratulate both the Secretary-General for his \r\ninitiatives and the rest of the international bodies and \r\ncivil society for the specific actions they are \r\nimplementing around the world. \r\n Speeches, reports and fine words are necessary \r\nbut we suffer from a serious inability to act. Let us not \r\nhide behind excuses. Let us take action based on the \r\nfacts. The dignity of every human being obliges us to \r\ndo so and humanity deserves it! \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chief of the Government \r\nof the Principality of Andorra for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Albert Pintat, Chief of the Government of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by His Excellency Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, \r\nHead of Government and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Political Affairs and Economic \r\nPlanning of the Republic of San Marino \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Political Affairs and \r\nEconomic Planning of the Republic of San Marino. \r\n Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Political Affairs \r\nand Economic Planning of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Head \r\nof Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nPolitical Affairs and Economic Planning of the \r\nRepublic of San Marino, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Stolfi (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe Government and the people of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, I wish to congratulate Mr. d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his appointment as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. Please rest \r\nassured that the Republic of San Marino is eager to \r\noffer all its support for the success of this session. \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 42 \r\n \r\n I would like to express our appreciation for the \r\nexcellent work carried out during the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly by the outgoing \r\nPresident, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, in particular for the \r\ncommitment and determination he demonstrated while \r\npresiding over the Assembly and promoting the United \r\nNations reform agenda. \r\n I would also like to give special thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the great \r\nenergy and dedication he has displayed in leading this \r\nOrganization and, in particular, for his admirable \r\ncommitment to the United Nations reform agenda and \r\nhis continuing vigilance and determination in the face \r\nof emergencies and events of international political \r\nimportance. \r\n Furthermore, I would like to express San \r\nMarino’s appreciation for the consideration the \r\nSecretary-General has shown to all United Nations \r\nMember States, without distinction, including small \r\nStates, and for the attention he has paid to particularly \r\ndelicate and urgent issues, such as climate change and \r\nthe global food crisis. \r\n The United Nations reform process is of \r\nfundamental importance to world equilibrium and must \r\nremain the focus of our efforts. We must not allow our \r\nfailure to reach agreement on United Nations reform to \r\nlead to the decentralization and weakening of the \r\nOrganization’s pivotal role. \r\n The key role played by the United Nations is of \r\nthe essence in present international conditions, marked \r\nby wars and national conflict. In these early stages of \r\nthe twenty-first century, we are witnessing a series of \r\nnew conflicts ever more driven by economic interests \r\nand clashes of civilizations, both ethnic and religious, \r\noften within the same country. \r\n More than 60 years ago, the signatory States of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations assumed the shared \r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. They undertook to work together to prevent \r\nand remove threats to international security, to \r\nsuppress acts of aggression and to resolve, through \r\npeaceful means, disputes within and between States \r\nthat could lead to war. \r\n On the sixtieth anniversary of the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping bodies, it is important to \r\nremember the men and women who believe in those \r\nideals, who have dedicated themselves to the people of \r\nthe world, working tirelessly to promote peace and \r\nstability worldwide in dangerous war-torn zones with \r\nresolve, dedication and professionalism while always \r\nremaining impartial and neutral. \r\n However, in spite of all their work, we are still \r\nfar from attaining those goals and the United Nations \r\nhas not had a full impact on many international crises. \r\nThe reform of the United Nations in this context has \r\nthus become even more essential. Reform would enable \r\nthe United Nations to have the necessary strength to \r\nact, fully respecting the ideals and objectives that it set \r\nitself at its founding. \r\n The Republic of San Marino has always \r\nsupported the United Nations reform process and, in \r\nparticular, believes the process of the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly to be fundamental. Those \r\nreforms are necessary to reaffirm the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as the most representative body of \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n The Republic of San Marino believes that the \r\nstrengthening of the General Assembly is of even \r\ngreater significance for, as a profoundly democratic \r\nbody of the United Nations, it currently represents the \r\nmost important forum in which a small State can be \r\nheard and bring its own contribution at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n Greater efficiency would make the General \r\nAssembly more complementary in its relations with the \r\nother main bodies of the United Nations, thus avoiding \r\nany duplication of activities and establishing \r\nmechanisms that would effectively implement the \r\nprovisions of resolutions adopted by the Assembly. \r\n The process of democratization within the bodies \r\nof the United Nations assumes fundamental importance \r\nfor a small State such as the Republic of San Marino. \r\nGreater representation and democratization of the \r\nOrganization’s main bodies can guarantee States with \r\nsmall territories and populations the possibility of \r\nparticipating and having a larger role in the decision-\r\nmaking process within multilateral bodies. \r\n I am convinced that smaller States like San \r\nMarino can contribute in a fundamental way to the \r\nOrganization precisely because they do not have \r\nmacroeconomic, military or geopolitical interests. \r\n It is of parallel importance that small States \r\nestablish efficient forms of collaboration and \r\nconsultation in order to coordinate their actions so that \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n43 08-51851 \r\n \r\ntheir voices can be adequately heard within \r\ninternational organizations.  \r\n In the framework of contacts with other small \r\nEuropean States, which are frequently renewed, \r\nincluding on the occasion of our participation in the \r\nwork of the General Assembly, San Marino has \r\npromoted a meeting with other small European States \r\nwith which it is already collaborating on specific \r\nhumanitarian projects, to consider other forms of \r\nmultilateral collaboration. \r\n Having participated with a group of small States \r\nin the financing of a UNICEF project for children \r\naffected by HIV in Gabon, this year the Republic of \r\nSan Marino, in concert with the private sector, is taking \r\npart in other UNICEF projects aimed, in particular, at \r\nprotecting the rights of disabled children. \r\n Strong involvement in the protection of children’s \r\nrights has characterized relations between San Marino \r\nand UNICEF for many years. That commitment was \r\nfurther expressed last December through the \r\nparticipation of Their Excellencies the Captains Regent \r\nat the commemorative plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the follow-up to the outcome of the \r\nspecial session on children, an event that lent further \r\nimpetus to the States’ activities and underscored the \r\nneed for their cooperation. \r\n Population growth, climate change and the spread \r\nof new diseases, as well as economic and financial \r\ninstability and armed conflicts, are seriously \r\nthreatening the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In particular, the subject \r\nof climate change has become a priority in the United \r\nNations agenda over the last two years because of its \r\nimpact on our habits and the future needs of all \r\ncountries without distinction. Those regions that are \r\nmost vulnerable due to their geographic position, as \r\nwell as developing countries, and small islands in \r\nparticular, are facing an even graver emergency \r\nsituation. \r\n In addition, the global food crisis and rising \r\nprices present a trend that is increasingly distressing. \r\nThe United Nations and the specialized agencies play a \r\ncentral role in confronting those emergencies. In \r\nparticular, the Republic of San Marino would like to \r\nexpress its full support to the High-Level Task Force \r\non the Global Food Security Crisis, established by the \r\nSecretary-General last April with the precise objective \r\nof coordinating all ongoing activities aimed at \r\nstemming the crisis. \r\n On the occasion of the opening of the fifty-\r\nsecond session of the Commission on the Status of \r\nWomen, the Secretary-General announced the launch \r\nof the campaign “Unite to End Violence Against \r\nWomen”. San Marino intends to work in support of that \r\ncampaign to protect the rights of women, which \r\nparallels a commitment undertaken during its \r\nchairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the \r\nCouncil of Europe. \r\n I would like to add that the campaign to combat \r\nviolence against women was also carried out at the \r\nnational level, where we tried to raise public awareness \r\nof an issue too often ignored or underestimated. \r\nFollowing that initiative, the Parliament of San Marino \r\nrecently adopted a new law: the Prevention and \r\nRepression of Violence against Women and of Gender-\r\nBased Violence. It is a decisive and innovative legal \r\ninstrument for our country that provides for, inter alia, \r\nthe introduction of preventive measures addressing \r\nviolence against women and gender-based violence, as \r\nwell as the protection of victims during criminal \r\nproceedings. \r\n The Republic of San Marino also pays particular \r\nattention to the problems faced by persons with \r\ndisabilities and the protection of their rights. San \r\nMarino has in fact already ratified the International \r\nConvention on the Protection and Promotion of the \r\nRights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities and its \r\nOptional Protocol.  \r\n The Republic of San Marino is pleased to \r\ncelebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.  \r\n The Republic of San Marino has always been \r\ncommitted to the promotion of the principles of \r\npeaceful coexistence and the mutual respect between \r\nindividuals and peoples, in the knowledge that the \r\nunderstanding of others and mutual respect are the \r\nfundamental prerequisites of justice and peace. The \r\npromotion of intercultural dialogue is a concrete tool \r\nfor attaining those values and for affirming one of the \r\nguiding principles of the United Nations: peace \r\nfounded on justice and international cooperation. \r\n San Marino is committed to and continues to \r\nwork towards the promotion of intercultural dialogue, \r\nin particular in its religious dimension. At the regional \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 44 \r\n \r\nlevel, in the context of its activities in the Council of \r\nEurope, San Marino this year coordinated the Council’s \r\nfirst meeting on the religious dimension of intercultural \r\ndialogue, which was held on an experimental basis. \r\nRepresentatives of member States of the Council of \r\nEurope, religious leaders, experts and representatives \r\nof civil society participated in the meeting. The \r\ndevelopment of dialogue among and with religions at \r\nall levels of society makes a fundamental contribution \r\nto preventing tensions which may endanger the \r\npeaceful coexistence of peoples, as stressed at the \r\nhigh-level meeting on that subject promoted by the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to wish the President \r\ngreat success in his important task and to assure him of \r\nour full support during the sixty-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Political Affairs and \r\nEconomic Planning of the Republic of San Marino for \r\nthe statement just made.  \r\n Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Political Affairs and \r\nEconomic Planning of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Norway. \r\n Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Jens Stoltenberg, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Stoltenberg (Norway): Sixty years ago, in \r\nthe fall of 1948, the United Nations adopted the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. That \r\ninternational bill of rights contains a forceful reminder \r\nthat force can and will be checked, and that the prime \r\npurpose of our work here is to keep the strong just and \r\nthe weak secure.  \r\n We will celebrate the anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights later this fall, \r\nand we shall be guided by its wording in everything we \r\ndo. The rights and opportunities of individuals, groups \r\nand countries are fundamental, and the United Nations \r\nis at the top of the system that oversees those superior \r\nrules.  \r\n When I come here every year, I am struck by the \r\nbroad span of items that are discussed in the United \r\nNations. We need to ask, are we focusing on the truly \r\nessential, most serious issues of our times? This year, \r\nwe left on the table the unfinished business of the Doha \r\nRound of trade negotiations. The break-up of those \r\ntalks has stalled our efforts to provide billions of \r\npeople with increased economic opportunity. It is \r\ncrucial that we restart this process. \r\n We face a global food crisis. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has described the effect of that crisis on \r\nhundreds of millions of people who do not know if \r\nthey will have enough to eat tomorrow.  \r\n Climate and energy are among the biggest issues \r\nof our time. They must be on the top of our agenda.  \r\n These big issues are also all about poverty, \r\ninequity and gender. Leadership is called for — \r\nleadership here at the United Nations. \r\n I believe we face not only a food crisis, an energy \r\ncrisis, a climate crisis, a trade-talk crisis, but a larger, \r\ndecision-making crisis.  \r\n We have great institutional capacity. We discuss, \r\nwe deliberate and we study, but we are too often unable \r\nto decide. Often, those countries that want the least are \r\nthe countries that decide the most. Those that want the \r\nleast amount of change and progress are able to slow \r\nus down and block decisions. Now also the Security \r\nCouncil seems to face difficulties after many good \r\nyears. \r\n All countries, all Member States share the \r\nresponsibility for the functioning of the United Nations \r\nas a decision-making body that serves us, that is for \r\npeople, that solves global problems and that allows all \r\npeople to benefit from the rights with which they were \r\nborn and which are written in the Declaration on \r\nHuman Rights. \r\n To become more effective, the United Nations \r\nmust reform. The Secretary-General addressed this \r\nissue with strong conviction on Tuesday (5th meeting). \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n45 08-51851 \r\n \r\nWe should support him in that process. I am vesting \r\nhope in the ongoing deliberation on system-wide \r\ncoherence. I co-chaired the High-level Panel on \r\nSystem-wide Coherence, and I am heartened that more \r\nand more countries seem to be opting in on the “One \r\nUN” approach. \r\n Some organizations, funds and programmes are \r\nmaking efficiency gains. They are truly exceptions. \r\nStill, Norway is committed to using the United Nations \r\nas the arena for our most important international \r\npolicymaking activities. We allocate 0.98 per cent of \r\nour national income to official development aid. We \r\nare the seventh largest contributor to the United \r\nNations in absolute terms. That is why we will be \r\nkeeping a watchful eye on how the funds and \r\nprogrammes manage their resources and our \r\ncontributions. We and other donor countries will have \r\nto require improved accountability, transparency and a \r\nresults-based management system. \r\n Reaching the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) is our foremost priority. We have assumed a \r\nspecial responsibility regarding MDG 4 on child \r\nmortality and MDG 5 on maternal health. We must all \r\ndedicate the next seven years to the bottom billion. \r\nSeveral leaders joined me today in presenting a report \r\nfrom the Global Campaign for the Health Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We also presented a plan for the \r\nnext seven years — an exceptional plan that can allow \r\nus to save 10 million lives. If we succeed, we will \r\nbuild more sustainable societies, reduce conflict \r\npotential and provide a better basis for growth. \r\n We are making progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Poverty is being reduced. Child \r\nmortality is falling. But we have not made any progress \r\nat all with regard to maternal health. That is appalling. \r\nThere can be only one reason for this awful situation, \r\nand that is a persistent neglect of women in a world \r\ndominated by men. Just think of all the millions of \r\nyoung girls and young women who know, and who fear \r\nand dread, that giving life may cause their own death. \r\nAll this human tragedy is avoidable by simple means, \r\nbut we have not taken the problem seriously. \r\n Money does not seem to be a problem when the \r\nproblem is money. Let us look for a moment at what is \r\nhappening on Wall Street and in financial markets \r\naround the world. There, unsound investment threatens \r\nthe homes and the jobs of the middle class. Something \r\nis fundamentally wrong when money seems to be \r\nabundant but funds for investment in people seem so \r\nshort in supply. Market mechanisms will not fund \r\nschools in Afghanistan, hospitals in Rwanda, vaccines \r\ngiven in the slums and the ghettos. That kind of \r\ninvestment requires political will and decisions. And \r\nwe must provide the framework that will direct \r\nresources towards those ends. \r\n When Robert Kennedy was running for president \r\n40 years ago, he said in a speech that a country’s health \r\ncannot be measured simply by its economic output. \r\nThat output, he said, “counts special locks for our \r\ndoors and the jails for those who break them … yet ... \r\ndoes not allow for the health of our children, the \r\nquality of their education or the joy of their play”. And \r\nstill I would add that health, education and the joy of \r\nplay form the capital that must grow and spread. Then, \r\nand only then, will we reach more equal levels of \r\ndevelopment and opportunity. \r\n I have come here directly from a visit to the great \r\nrainforests of the Amazon, in Brazil, a country whose \r\npresident is committed to lifting his people out of \r\ndestitution. That has been President Lula’s leitmotif \r\nthroughout his political life. \r\n Norway is a fortunate and developed country. \r\nFrom that follows a moral responsibility. We pursue \r\nwider development goals and seek to generate positive \r\nincentives for change and improve climate change \r\npolicies.  \r\n Efforts against deforestation may give us the \r\nlargest, quickest and cheapest reductions in greenhouse \r\ngas emissions. In the years leading up to 2015 Norway \r\nwill contribute up to $1 billion to reduce deforestation \r\nin the Amazon. This contribution makes Norway the \r\nfirst contributor to the Amazon Fund. The size of \r\nNorway’s contribution will depend on how successful \r\nBrazil will be in reducing deforestation. \r\n In Bali last December, Norway announced a \r\nmajor initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \r\nfrom deforestation and forest degradation. \r\nDeforestation must be included in a new global \r\nagreement on climate change. Addressing climate \r\nchange in a fashion that will stand the test of time and \r\nthe scrutiny of future generations ultimately boils down \r\nto us versus the sand in the hourglass. It is a test of \r\nmaturity for international cooperation. \r\n Finally, I would like to say a few words about a \r\nfellow Nordic country. For the first time since \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 46 \r\n \r\nbecoming a Member State of the United Nations in \r\n1946 — after 62 years — Iceland is a candidate for the \r\nSecurity Council. Iceland’s candidature reflects the \r\nlong-standing commitment of all the Nordic countries \r\nto international peace and the vital work of the United \r\nNations. Iceland enjoys the active support of its \r\npartners in the Nordic group: Denmark, Finland, \r\nSweden and Norway. I urge members to take that into \r\naccount. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway for the statement he has just \r\nmade.  \r\nMr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Denzil Douglas, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Minister of National Security and \r\nImmigration, Minister of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and Minister of Tourism, Sports \r\nand Culture of Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Minister of National Security and \r\nImmigration, Minister of Sustainable Development and \r\nMinister of Tourism, Sports and Culture of Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis. \r\nMr. Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Minister of National Security \r\nand Immigration, Minister of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and Minister of Tourism, Sports and \r\nCulture of Saint Kitts and Nevis, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Denzil \r\nDouglas, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Minister of National Security and Immigration, \r\nMinister of Sustainable Development and Minister of \r\nTourism, Sports and Culture of Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Douglas (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I wish to \r\nbegin by thanking His Excellency Srgjan Kerim for his \r\nleadership over the past year as President of this august \r\nand venerable body at its sixty-second session. I also \r\nwish to congratulate and extend best wishes to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of \r\nNicaragua on his assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. \r\n Twenty-five years ago almost to the day, two \r\nCaribbean peoples who had always been separated by \r\nwater but had long been united by history, culture and \r\ncircumstance joined forces to embark upon a bold \r\nexperiment. Having between them a land mass of just \r\nover 100 square miles and a population of \r\napproximately 50,000, the people of Saint Kitts and the \r\npeople of Nevis decided to step forward as one nation \r\nto join the world community of sovereign States. \r\n It is an honour and a pleasure for me to be here to \r\nrepresent that nation at the United Nations, a potent \r\nsymbol of freedom and sovereignty. That symbolism \r\nmeans all the more to my people at this particular time, \r\nas this sixty-third session of the General Assembly \r\ncoincides with the celebration of my nation’s twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of political independence. \r\n Building and reinforcing the pillars of nationhood \r\nhas not been easy, but we have always considered it an \r\nessential task and a challenge worth facing. Therefore, \r\nas chief servant of my people and my cherished land, I \r\nstand before the Assembly today, emboldened by the \r\npride of a nation that has taken its full and rightful \r\nplace among the community of independent nations, a \r\nvibrant democracy with a thriving economy, a deep \r\ncommitment to justice and human rights, and an \r\nabiding faith in social equity. \r\n Mine is a pride that comes not only from \r\nrealizing the benefits of the practical policies and \r\nprogrammes created over the years to improve the \r\nstandard of living and uplift our people, but also from \r\nthe sense of community, partnership and civic and \r\npersonal responsibility that have shaped the destiny of \r\nmy proud nation. \r\n It is also the pride that comes from witnessing \r\nfirst-hand the true value of freedom — a freedom that \r\nhas enabled us to share in the triumphs of democracy \r\nand to mould the creative genius and the industrious, \r\nenterprising spirit of our people into a single \r\ncommunity of goodwill and commitment that moves \r\nour people and great country forward. \r\n It is a pride borne of weathering storms of \r\nexternal economic shocks, including fluctuating \r\ncommodity prices and the withdrawal of preferential \r\nmarket access, while being able to successfully \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n47 08-51851 \r\n \r\ntransform three centuries of a monocultural, sugar-\r\nbased economy into a vibrant and competitive services-\r\ndriven economy. Many other small States have not \r\nbeen as fortunate, however. \r\n That is evident in our sister Caribbean nation of \r\nHaiti, where the devastating effects of four consecutive \r\nhurricanes in the space of one month continue to \r\nundermine the Government’s effort to build strong \r\ninstitutions and to invest in the productive enterprises \r\nand infrastructure that generate employment and \r\nimproved living conditions. \r\n The progress witnessed in Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\nwas not achieved by chance. Since the birth of our \r\nnation 25 years ago, we have faced a multitude of \r\nproblems, some of which are fortunately behind us, but \r\nseveral others of which have emerged and grown in \r\nintensity and scope. \r\n However, our experience in Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\ndemonstrates that good governance and prudent \r\nmanagement of one’s resources; appropriate investment \r\nin people and systems; the protection people’s freedom \r\nof association, religion and speech; the support and \r\nfacilitation of a free and vibrant press; success at \r\nadvancing the socio-economic well-being of one’s \r\npeople; and the upholding of democratic ideals are \r\ndetermined not by land mass, but by national character \r\nand political commitment. They are the result not of \r\ndemographics or geographic size, but of long-standing \r\nsociocultural traditions. They are a function not of \r\ngross domestic product, but of an entrenched ethos of \r\nstriving and determination. Our faith has steadied our \r\nresolve and belief in ourselves and our future. Of \r\ncourse, along the way, we have relied, understandably \r\non such institutions as our beloved United Nations. \r\n Through membership, Saint Kitts and Nevis has \r\nbuilt important and strategic partnerships, stood \r\nshoulder to shoulder with other Member States to \r\nprotect our individual rights and collective freedoms, \r\nand have fought battles far bigger than would be \r\nexpected for a country of its size. We have also been \r\nwitnesses to the positives and negatives, the strengths \r\nand failings of our world, but have soldiered on \r\ntogether in common cause. \r\n That is why, 25 years later, I remain optimistic \r\nabout the progress of the United Nations and its ability \r\nto defend the poor and needy despite the pull of \r\ncompeting powerful national agendas that have \r\noccasionally threatened to undermine the ethos of the \r\ninstitution and, indeed, the common good. From where \r\nI stand today, I have come to appreciate those \r\nachievements and to appreciate that, even at this \r\njuncture, providence affords us still new opportunities \r\nto renew our cherished institution. \r\n It is very easy to side with the cynics when the \r\nSecurity Council becomes frozen in stalemate or when \r\nthe need for action falls victim to political posturing. \r\nBut history, particularly that of the past two decades, \r\ninstructs me that the United Nations is far more than \r\nthe sum of its weaknesses, because for millions of \r\npeople around the world this Organization is their only \r\nhope, a bridge between life and death, a bastion of \r\nfreedom and a beacon of hope. \r\n It is my hope, therefore, that in this “Assembly of \r\nfrankness” there will be a sober and unrelenting \r\nanalysis of the human consequences of sweeping and \r\nglobally enforced trade and economic regimes on small \r\nStates all around the globe. And it is also my hope that \r\nthe economic uncertainties now being experienced in \r\nsome of the world’s larger economies will sensitize us \r\nall to the breadth of the uncertainty, the depth of the \r\nanxiety and the real psychological trauma that often \r\ngrip small States when policies that are formulated far \r\nbeyond their shores and are utterly unresponsive to \r\ntheir entreaties are nonetheless thrust unflinchingly \r\nupon them. \r\n Recent events have brought into focus the issue \r\nof the stability of the world’s financial systems and \r\nfinancial institutions. The circumstances that have led \r\nto collapsing financial institutions and rising prices for \r\nfood and energy were not created by small States such \r\nas Saint Kitts and Nevis. But yet again, as in the case \r\nof climate change, we are victims of the act of others, \r\nbut with no resources whatsoever to combat the \r\nconsequences. \r\n Earlier this year, I participated in the High-level \r\nConference on World Food Security, held in June in \r\nRome. The upbeat response from several heads of State \r\nor Government and from the numerous ministers of \r\nagriculture, forestry, fisheries, water, energy and \r\nenvironment who participated in that meeting was, for \r\nme, a strong indication of the relevance and timeliness \r\nof the Conference for nations seeking to take positive \r\naction on the issue of food security. \r\n The current trend continues to have a lopsided \r\nimpact on the poor and on the increasing numbers of \r\nextremely poor and vulnerable people, who are those \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 48 \r\n \r\nleast able to counter the impact of economic \r\ndislocations facing our countries. Mindful of our \r\npersonal responsibility as leaders and of the heightened \r\nexpectations of our citizens, the Government of Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis has been taking practical measures to \r\nalleviate the suffering of our resilient people. We have \r\naddressed the important dimensions of availability and \r\naccess to certain food staples such as rice, flour and \r\nsugar. We have looked at how best to stabilize prices to \r\ninject predictability into the system without prejudice \r\nto free market economics. We have also begun to \r\nrationalize and promote proper utilization of \r\nagricultural lands through land use diversion and \r\ndiversification, providing financial and seedling \r\nsupport to farmers and recommending water \r\nrationalization and enhanced irrigation techniques. \r\n The problems to which I have alluded are not \r\nunique to Saint Kitts and Nevis. Members will recall \r\npopular riots in some countries, including in Haiti, \r\nwhere they led to the resignation of that country’s \r\nGovernment. That is evidence of just how the impact \r\nof the rising cost of food and the despair visited upon \r\nwhole communities could easily undermine peoples’ \r\nfaith in their Governments to deliver on the promises \r\nof democracy, free market economics and \r\nglobalization. \r\n It was in January 2008 that the food price index \r\nestablished by the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nof the United Nations (FAO) jumped by 47 per cent \r\nover the previous year. This included increases for cereals \r\nby some 62 per cent, dairy products by 69 per cent and \r\nvegetable oils by 85 per cent. In some instances, prices of \r\nstaple foods such as maize, wheat, rice and beans have \r\nrisen by more than 100 per cent. This global economic \r\ndownturn, coupled with the dramatic upsurge in \r\ncommodity prices, has created the worst food crisis in \r\nrecent years. \r\n This new phenomenon will make it much more \r\ndifficult for us to address the growing incidence of \r\npoverty in and among our nations and our ability to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving \r\nextreme poverty and hunger throughout the world by \r\n2015. \r\n Against this backdrop, and given the need for \r\nurgent action, we also urge that the issue of reform, a \r\nrecurrent United Nations theme for some 15 years, be \r\nrevisited with renewed vigour and commitment. Far \r\ntoo much time has passed. Far too little has been done. \r\nAnd far too much now hangs in the balance. Let us \r\nequip the United Nations with the tools necessary to \r\nfulfil its mandates, especially in the areas of protecting \r\nindividual freedoms and human rights and of \r\npromoting economic development as an integral \r\nelement of human security around the world. For as \r\nClarence Darrow said, “You can only protect your \r\nliberties in the world by protecting the other man’s \r\nfreedom. You can only be free if I am free”. \r\n The continuous suppression of freedom — overt \r\nor disguised — under the cloak of civil order or \r\nterritorial integrity, must be tackled openly. Freedom \r\nand personal responsibility go hand in hand. How can \r\nwe encourage people to take personal responsibility but \r\ndeprive them of their personal freedom? That is the \r\nfundamental question. \r\n Our presence here today is both a demonstration \r\nand an acknowledgement of the increasingly \r\ninterconnected nature of our world. I wish to say that \r\nmuch of what Saint Kitts and Nevis has achieved over \r\nthe past 25 years has been the result of our people’s \r\nhard work and discipline, combined with the benefits \r\nthat have accrued from both our multilateral and our \r\nbilateral relations. In that regard, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme has been a vibrant partner in \r\nadvancing the programmatic goals of our twin-island \r\nfederation, as have UNESCO and other United Nations \r\nagencies. Our relationship with this Organization is \r\none that we cherish dearly.  \r\n We have worked with and through subregional \r\nentities such as the Organization of Eastern Caribbean \r\nStates, regional mechanisms such as the Caribbean \r\nCommunity and hemispheric institutions such as the \r\nOrganization of American States. Through regional \r\nmechanisms we have been able to map a course for \r\nfunctional cooperation on issues such as trade, security \r\nand health. Within the Pan-Caribbean Partnership \r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, we have developed a regional \r\nresponse to tackle the epidemic of HIV/AIDS. In the \r\narea of environmental protection, we continue to \r\ncollaborate on and to work towards disaster reduction \r\nand mitigation. And we are assiduously exploring \r\nrenewable energy sources, including geothermal \r\nenergy, on which we have made encouraging progress. \r\n On the issue of bilateral relations, I am pleased to \r\nsay that we have built many deeply valued \r\nrelationships over the years, and we continue to further \r\nstrengthen those relations. In the light of that, we urge \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n49 08-51851 \r\n \r\nthat a way be found to facilitate the participation of the \r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the specialized \r\nagencies of the United Nations. As world challenges \r\nhave expanded, the Republic of China on Taiwan has \r\nstepped forward to provide technical assistance in the \r\nareas of social and agricultural development, as well as \r\ndisaster relief in many countries, thus bringing \r\nenormous benefits to both public and private sectors. \r\n Whatever the tone and tenor of the ongoing \r\ndebate, climate change is an aspect of our modern \r\nexperience. Because of our activities and our assault on \r\nEarth’s atmosphere, many processes have negatively \r\nimpacted rivers, lakes and oceans, resulting in fast-\r\nmelting polar ice caps and rising sea levels and \r\nexposing us to greater risks of harmful solar radiation \r\nand greenhouse gas emissions. Wherever culpability \r\nmay reside, those processes all have serious \r\nimplications and consequences for small island States. \r\nIn varying degrees and at various levels, those changes \r\nimpact hundreds of thousands of small-scale farmers, \r\nfishermen and other people who depend heavily on the \r\nnatural environment for their livelihood but are already \r\nwitnessing lower crop yields and smaller catches. \r\n It is no longer sufficient simply to lay blame at \r\nthe feet of countries, businesses and people who \r\npollute. We need effective strategies based on scientific \r\nconsensus and, of course, solution-focused approaches \r\nthat address such issues as the suitability of land for \r\nvarious types of crops, dedicated areas for livestock, \r\npasture development, the marine environment, impact \r\non health and health care, the productivity of forests \r\nand the increased incidence of pests and diseases, as \r\nwell as implications for biodiversity and ecosystems. \r\nWe must collaborate in addressing those effects, and \r\nwe must take necessary corrective action in order to \r\nbuild a safer environment for ourselves and our future \r\ngenerations. \r\n Our destinies and our freedoms are all \r\ninterwoven. It was Franklin D. Roosevelt who said that \r\n“true individual freedom cannot exist without \r\neconomic security and independence”. As Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis commemorates its silver-jubilee year of \r\nindependence, we therefore feel compelled to call on \r\nthe United Nations and the members of the Security \r\nCouncil to work together to put an end to the genocide \r\nin parts of Africa. I also call on the United Nations to \r\ntake firm action in the lead-up to the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment so that that event will bring real relief \r\nand development, even to the far corners of Africa. \r\n For much too long we have, perhaps unwittingly, \r\nseparated human security from representative \r\ndemocracy and economic development from human \r\nrights. Those are inextricably linked. When we fight \r\nfor the freedom of our brothers to vote but ignore their \r\ninalienable right to food security, that is a skewed \r\nprinciple; it is a half-measure based on a selective \r\nmorality in which our fight will always be only \r\npartially won. \r\n We cannot simply tell our citizens that they are \r\nfree to vote, while failing to help them transform \r\nfreedoms into practical systems that support and \r\nadvance personal dreams. Democracy, I emphasize, is \r\nthe best vehicle through which humankind can realize \r\nits dreams and aspirations. I firmly believe that true \r\nindependence, like freedom, can come only from doing \r\nwhat is right. \r\n And so I continue to believe in the United \r\nNations, but beyond that, I have faith — an abiding \r\nfaith — in the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, whose \r\nconfidence in themselves as a nation and whose \r\ncommitment to the future have made possible the \r\nsuccesses, positive growth and development that they \r\nhave achieved, as well as the international partnerships \r\nthat they have established, over the past 25 years. \r\n Therefore, I say to the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations: Let us commit to doing the right \r\nthings. Let us continue the important work to reform \r\nand revitalize the United Nations. Let us tackle food \r\nsecurity by recognizing that globalization was meant to \r\nimprove our lives, not to worsen them. Globalization \r\nwas meant to facilitate the free movement of goods and \r\nservices, not to provide an opportunity for erecting \r\nartificial and unilateral barriers that punish poor and \r\nless competitive countries. Let us do the right thing \r\nabout climate change. And together, one step at a time, \r\nlet us do the right thing by using the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to address the fundamental development \r\nchallenges facing developing countries in Africa and \r\nthroughout the world. All that and far more is within \r\nthe power and the capacity of a reordered United \r\nNations and of Member States that are willing to take \r\npersonal responsibility in that regard. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 50 \r\n \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of National \r\nSecurity and Immigration, Minister of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and Minister of Tourism, Sports and \r\nCulture of Saint Kitts and Nevis for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\nThe Honourable Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of \r\nNational Security and Immigration, Minister of \r\nSustainable Development and Minister of \r\nTourism, Sports and Culture of Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for General \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \r\nMr. Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Balkenende (Netherlands): When the present \r\nsession of the General Assembly began on Tuesday, the \r\nSecretary-General made important remarks about the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \r\nfinancial crisis. The world is witnessing extraordinary \r\nfinancial turbulence, and all parties must shoulder their \r\nresponsibility. \r\n At the same time, the current crisis should not \r\ndistract us from the need to achieve the MDGs. What \r\nkind of world do we want to leave to our children and \r\ngrandchildren? Any parent who considers that question \r\nfor a moment will answer: a world in which my \r\nchildren are safe and can build decent lives, free from \r\nwant; a world in which my children can reach their full \r\npotential without fear of repression or terror; a world in \r\nwhich my children are free and their rights are \r\nprotected. \r\n Everything that we do as the United Nations is \r\nabout deep desires. There is a direct link between this \r\nUnited Nations building and the homes of hundreds of \r\nmillions of families all over the world. \r\n One man who forcefully reminded us that we are \r\nresponsible for the opportunities open to future \r\ngenerations was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In early \r\n1941, in the darkest hour of the Second World War, he \r\ngave us his vision of the future: the dawning of a world \r\nin which people would enjoy freedom of expression \r\nand belief and would be free from fear and want. After \r\nthe war, those freedoms became our moral compass. \r\nThey were set out in the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, proclaimed by this very Assembly \r\nalmost 60 years ago. Human rights remain the \r\ncornerstone of Dutch policy. \r\n If we look around us today, we can see that \r\nreality falls far short of our ideal. We still live in a \r\nworld where, each year, more than 9 million children \r\ndie before they reach the age of five, and every day \r\nmillions of people live in fear of violence and the \r\nabuse of power. \r\n We cannot accept that. Together, the United \r\nNations comprises a working community and our work \r\nis not done — not by a long way. Global challenges \r\nrequire global solutions. Global solutions require \r\nglobal action. Every one of us needs to ask ourselves: \r\nWhat am I doing to make freedom a reality for people \r\nat home and elsewhere? \r\n What are we doing to bring about freedom from \r\nwant? In the past 10 years, millions of people have \r\nmanaged to escape from poverty. In Asia and parts of \r\nAfrica, a great deal of progress has been made, thanks \r\nto the efforts of many people. That progress should \r\ninspire hope as we continue to work towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. There is still so much \r\nto do. In some countries, the situation is actually \r\ngetting worse, especially where health is concerned. \r\nOne child still dies every three seconds, one mother \r\nevery minute. \r\n All Governments need to realize that good and \r\nethical governance is an essential foundation for \r\ndevelopment, and realizing that, they must act \r\naccordingly. That also applies to the current financial \r\ncrisis, where urgent action is needed. The financial \r\nsector and regulators should quickly implement the \r\nrecommendations of the Financial Stability Forum: \r\nstricter supervision, better risk management, greater \r\ntransparency and enhanced accountability. That is how \r\nto restore confidence in the financial markets and \r\nprevent future crises. The International Monetary Fund \r\nshould play a central role in that process by further \r\n A/63/PV.10\r\n \r\n51 08-51851 \r\n \r\nstepping up its financial sector oversight. Together, we \r\nshould re-establish the stability and integrity of the \r\nfinancial system. \r\n Governments have a duty to provide food for \r\ntheir people. The international community will support \r\nall those who fight against hunger, want and disease, \r\nbut we must do so as efficiently as possible. We must \r\nnot waste resources; the need is too great. Above all, \r\nwe must work together. We must work together with \r\nother Governments, certainly, but also with the \r\nbusiness community and civil society. Public-private \r\npartnership works. I meet more and more entrepreneurs \r\nwho are committed to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and actively want to help. Let us grasp the hands \r\nthey extend. \r\n The Netherlands welcomes the initiative of \r\nMr. d’Escoto Brockmann to place food security at the \r\ncentre of this session of the General Assembly. Rising \r\nfood prices hit the poor hardest. The position of small \r\nfarmers is particularly important. If they are able to \r\nincrease production, not only will their own families \r\nbenefit, but the local community will too. That is why \r\nthe Netherlands has earmarked extra funding for the \r\ndevelopment of agriculture in developing countries.  \r\n However, there can be no food without water. \r\nWater is the source of all life — 1.8 billion people \r\ncurrently have no proper access to clean drinking \r\nwater, and their health, their very lives, are in the \r\nbalance. So the Netherlands has joined with countries \r\nthat believe that water is a human right, because access \r\nto water is an essential part of freedom from want. \r\n What are we doing to ensure that second essential \r\nfreedom — freedom from fear? Millions of people still \r\nlive in the middle of conflict and violence. We must \r\nnot accept that. Over the past 60 years, United Nations \r\npeace operations have played an important role in \r\nending conflict. In many areas, the United Nations has \r\nensured that dormant conflicts do not flare up again. So \r\nour efforts must continue, undiminished. Yet peace \r\noperations alone are not enough. The root cause of a \r\nconflict is often a political dispute, and it often requires \r\na political solution. \r\n There is no place in a free society for torture. \r\nThere is no place for the death penalty. We all strive \r\nfor a life without fear, yet there are people who face \r\nfear every day in order to defend human rights. To \r\nrecognize those brave people, the Netherlands has \r\nintroduced the Human Rights Defenders Tulip, a \r\nspecial honour that will be awarded annually on \r\nInternational Human Rights Day.  \r\n In our free world, no one is above the law and no \r\none is beneath it. The Netherlands is proud to host the \r\nlegal capital of the world in the city of The Hague. We \r\nwill continue to strive for an International Criminal \r\nCourt that is supported by all Member States. In a safe \r\nworld, right is stronger than might. Crimes that outrage \r\nworld opinion must always be punished. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court is there to support us in \r\nthat task, and we must support the Court — all of us, \r\nopenly and unconditionally. A wider acceptance of the \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice will \r\nalso strengthen the international legal order. \r\n We also need to speak about freedom of \r\nexpression and belief. The debate on that issue often \r\nleads to misunderstandings, incomprehension and fears \r\nthat national traditions may be swept aside. We can all \r\nbe proud of our cultures and traditions, of the things \r\nthat distinguish us from others. The challenge for every \r\nGovernment is to affirm its people’s cultural and \r\nreligious values and customs, and at the same time to \r\nbuild bridges with the rest of the world — bridges that \r\nenable people, organizations and religions to meet and \r\ndraw closer. Finding the right balance is not easy, but it \r\nis essential. \r\n Governments are there for everyone — for men \r\nand women; for people of all backgrounds and all \r\nreligious convictions; for monks, priests, rabbis and \r\nimams; and equally for those who do not believe in a \r\nsupreme being. Religion offers people comfort and \r\ninspiration in their personal lives. A religion is not a \r\nsystem of dogmas that may be imposed on others by \r\nforce, and it is certainly not a justification for using \r\nviolence when one feels aggrieved.  \r\n Everyone is free to profess his or her faith, to \r\nchange religion or not to believe. We must all cherish \r\nand defend the freedom of religion or belief. The same \r\ngoes for the freedom of people to express their views, \r\nand those freedoms go hand in hand. \r\n We all know that there are countries in the world \r\nwhere those freedoms are violated, and to those \r\ncountries I say: Respect the right of every person to \r\nfreedom of religion and freedom of expression. They \r\nare universal rights. They are universal freedoms. At \r\nthe same time, we must remind everyone who enjoys \r\nthose freedoms of their responsibility — the \r\nA/63/PV.10  \r\n \r\n08-51851 52 \r\n \r\nresponsibility to show the same respect to others that \r\nwe claim for ourselves. \r\n We need the United Nations to ensure those four \r\nessential freedoms for which we stand, and the United \r\nNations needs us. A strong United Nations is one in \r\nwhich universal values are central — a United Nations \r\nwith a fair and balanced Human Rights Council, a \r\nUnited Nations that unites and delivers. When we \r\nbegan building the United Nations together, the number \r\nof countries worldwide in which people enjoyed a \r\nreasonable level of freedom was around 15 per cent of \r\nthe total. Today, more than 60 per cent of countries can \r\nbe called free. \r\n In the same period, the number of people \r\nsuffering from malnutrition has fallen by several \r\nhundred million. The number of armed conflicts is also \r\ndeclining, however serious the situation remains in \r\ncertain troubled regions. Progress is possible, but it \r\ndoes not happen by itself. For the Netherlands, that is \r\nan incentive to continue working, heart and soul, for “a \r\nworld in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of \r\nspeech and belief and freedom from fear and want”. \r\n In conclusion, let me echo President Roosevelt’s \r\nwords: “The world order which we seek is the \r\ncooperation of free countries, working together in a \r\nfriendly, civilized society.” \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe meeting rose at 9 p.m. \r\n"
