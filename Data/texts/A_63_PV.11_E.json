I wish him great \r\nsuccess in carrying out that complex, responsible and \r\nchallenging task. I would also like to express my \r\nsincere gratitude and great respect to Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, President at the sixty-second session, for \r\nsuccessfully leading the Assembly during his tenure. In \r\naddition, I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and to emphasize our full \r\nsupport for his efforts to strengthen the position of the \r\nUnited Nations as a valuable factor in resolving the \r\nissues on the ever-expanding international agenda. \r\n Now, if the Assembly will permit me, I should \r\nlike to continue in my native language.  \r\n(spoke in Montenegrin; interpretation provided by the \r\ndelegation) \r\n As the youngest United Nations Member, \r\nMontenegro has left its mark on the international \r\nscene. It gained its statehood centuries ago and \r\ndemocratically restored it in 2006. For us, statehood \r\nrepresents political freedom, but also political \r\nresponsibility. Both are qualities that we look for and \r\nfind in the United Nations: in the spirit of its Charter, \r\nand in the promotion of mutual respect and equality \r\namong nations and peoples. \r\n Multilateralism lies at the core of the \r\ninternational system and inspires strong motivation and \r\ncommitment. That is why the United Nations provides \r\na reliable framework for maintaining international \r\npeace and security, strengthening democracy, \r\nprotecting human rights and freedoms, respecting \r\ninternational law and fostering the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of all States. \r\n Today, the world Organization is going through a \r\nprocess of necessary reform prompted by great \r\nachievements, but also by some setbacks, and even \r\nfailures. Montenegro supports a process of pragmatic \r\nreform at the United Nations. As a small State, we are \r\nparticularly interested in strengthening the authority of \r\nthe General Assembly and other main United Nations \r\nbodies. \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 2 \r\n \r\n The Security Council lies at the heart of the \r\noverall reform process and needs to be transformed \r\ntaking into account equitable regional representation, \r\ntransparency and improvement in its working methods. \r\nMontenegro supports intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nWe are undoubtedly faced with a very challenging and \r\ncomplex process, but one to which Montenegro will \r\nstrive to contribute. \r\n Respect for human rights and freedoms, \r\nimprovement of minority and faith-based rights and the \r\nstrengthening of good-neighbourly relations will \r\ncontinue to be the foundation of our national stability, \r\nas well of regional stability. Our engagement at \r\nnational, regional and international levels is therefore \r\nfocused on the rule of law and the fight against \r\ncorruption and organized crime. \r\n This year we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. The \r\nDeclaration is still vital and applicable. We are fully \r\ndedicated to its implementation and determined to \r\nuphold its values and principles. In support of that, \r\nMontenegro has presented its candidature for \r\nmembership of the Human Rights Council for the \r\nperiod 2012-2015. \r\n As the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals represents one of the key \r\nobjectives of United Nations policy, it is only natural \r\nthat small and developing States, such as Montenegro, \r\nshould be resolved to make a concerted effort towards \r\nthose goals. Aware of all the challenges in \r\nimplementing that agenda, Montenegro shares the \r\nSecretary-General’s opinion that yesterday’s high-level \r\nevent contributed positively to the increased \r\ncommitment to realize the goals that have been set. \r\n Challenges that we are facing today, including \r\npolitical problems, hotspots, blatant violations of \r\nhuman rights and freedoms, proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction, terrorism, environmental \r\ndegradation and climate change, require an adequate \r\nresponse and decisive action. We believe that no \r\neffective or lasting response is possible without joint \r\naction by the entire international community. \r\n Countries in transition, such as our own, have \r\nrelevant experience and are strongly motivated to offer \r\ncontinuous support to the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, in the light of the forthcoming \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, to be held in Doha. Economic challenges \r\nfaced by countries in transition affect the dynamics and \r\nquality of the way we tackle other issues, thus making \r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Declaration \r\nimperative. Therefore, the development needs and \r\npriorities of the African countries, discussed at length \r\nduring the 22 September high-level meeting, require \r\nurgent global solidarity and support. \r\n Montenegro fully supports United Nations efforts \r\nto resolve the problems caused by the energy crisis, \r\nespecially rising food prices worldwide. We also fully \r\nsupport the intention of the Secretary-General and of \r\nthe United Nations to focus the attention of the \r\ninternational community on vital issues such as food \r\nprices and food security, in addition to the issues of \r\nclimate change and the MDGs. The reason behind this \r\nis obvious: everyone is affected and is hence \r\ncommitted to solving those problems. \r\n In the light of that, we agree with the proposed \r\nUnited Nations action in the multilateral framework. \r\nWe commend the recent adoption of the Rome \r\nDeclaration on World Food Security, and strongly \r\nbelieve that integrated international action is the best \r\nresponse. \r\n As an ecologically concerned State, Montenegro \r\ncherishes an interactive relationship between the \r\nenvironmental aspects of the protection of natural \r\nresources, on the one hand, and the production and \r\ndistribution of organic food on the other hand. \r\nFurthermore, Montenegro encourages the creation of \r\nan international trade environment that favours small-\r\nscale producers and developing countries. Public-\r\nprivate partnerships on specific projects, as one form \r\nof cooperation between my Government and United \r\nNations agencies in the field of energy efficiency, are \r\nalso of special importance for us. \r\n Montenegro has many reasons to be satisfied with \r\nthe dynamics and results of its ongoing reform \r\nprocesses. Promotion of democracy, equality and \r\ntolerance among States and peoples has been and will \r\ncontinue to be our political doctrine. We are motivated \r\nby a desire for stability and economic and cultural \r\ndevelopment, and we demonstrate this in practice in \r\nour relationships with neighbours and regional \r\npartners. It is also a basis for Montenegro’s progress in \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration. \r\n Our European Union (EU) and NATO agenda is \r\nbased on the principles of democracy, a functional \r\nmarket economy, efficient institutions and the rule of \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n3 08-52272 \r\n \r\nlaw. In the process of integration, special emphasis is \r\nplaced on the dynamics and time frame in which our \r\nprogress is being achieved — in all areas, including \r\npolitical, legislative, economic and public administration \r\nreform. \r\n This year, Montenegro joined the Union for the \r\nMediterranean. We appreciate the support offered by \r\nour EU partners and other members of that significant \r\ninitiative. Montenegro stands ready to make its \r\ncontribution and to take an active part in the \r\nrevitalization of the projects within that initiative. \r\n Montenegro is taking a step forward in its \r\nsecurity policy, centred on multilateral cooperation, \r\nwith the aim of creating a legislative framework for the \r\ndeployment of our police, military and civilian \r\npersonnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions. \r\nMontenegro contributed to similar missions more than \r\n100 years ago, in the nineteenth century, and we are \r\nnow preparing to implement our commitment again in \r\norder to meet the current needs for fostering peace and \r\ndemocracy. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \r\ncommitment of Montenegro to contribute to the \r\nstrengthening and promotion of the United Nations in \r\nour common effort to identify adequate responses to \r\nmultifaceted challenges the world faces today. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Montenegro \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. René Garcia Préval, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti. \r\n  Mr. René Garcia Préval, President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. René Garcia Préval, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Préval (spoke in French): Just one \r\nyear ago (see A/62/PV.6), I recalled before this \r\nAssembly that I was bringing the words of a people \r\nwho for 200 years have experienced extreme suffering \r\nas a result of all kinds of material privation and \r\ncomplete vulnerability in the face of natural risks and \r\ndisasters. \r\n At that time, I hardly thought that I would find \r\nmyself here again one year later against the backdrop \r\nof the image of hundreds of children, women and the \r\nelderly swept away by floodwaters, hundreds of \r\nthousands of citizens suddenly finding themselves \r\nwithout shelter, tens of thousands of tons of \r\nagricultural harvest destroyed in a few hours, not to \r\nmention the incalculable damage to basic infrastructure \r\nsuch as communication networks, art works, irrigation \r\nsystems, the electricity grid, the water system and other \r\nstructures.  \r\n I am pointing out that those catastrophic events \r\noccurred just four months after the first angry \r\ndemonstrations of the population against the explosion \r\nin food prices, reactions that would be repeated on an \r\nalmost global scale, as though to express a collective \r\ncry of the poor regarding what was happening beyond \r\njust a global food crisis, as the rejection of an order for \r\nwhich the poor had too long been the only ones to pay \r\nthe cost. \r\n The damage caused four consecutive hurricanes \r\nin less than two months has set Haiti back several \r\nyears. Those hurricanes sorely test our capacity to \r\nresist, particularly when it must be borne in mind that \r\nall those victims, and their families, and all those \r\nbusinesses, large or small, have to fend for themselves \r\nwhile they wait for the State, and the State alone, to \r\nhelp them to get back on their feet or return to \r\nbusiness. There are no adequate market insurance \r\nsystems to compensate for the losses arising from that \r\nenormous damage.  \r\n I cannot thank the Secretary-General enough for \r\nthe great outpouring of sympathy that the United \r\nNations system has shown towards the people of Haiti \r\nfollowing those disasters. I can hardly express \r\nsufficient thanks for the mobilization organized by the \r\nUnited Nations agencies on the ground to bring help to \r\nthe most vulnerable and assist the affected families to \r\ntackle the most urgent problems. \r\n How can I thank the many friendly countries that \r\nso quickly mobilized their own resources and logistics \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 4 \r\n \r\nto come to the aid of the Haitians? How can we express \r\nour gratitude in the light of those expressions of \r\ncompassion and the numerous initiatives of solidarity \r\ncoming from civil society and the private sector in \r\nthose same friendly countries? \r\n Just as dark clouds have a silver lining, how \r\ncould I not recall that huge solidarity movement from \r\nwithin even our country, involving civil society and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, not to forget, of \r\ncourse, the millions of Haitians living abroad, in an \r\nunprecedented mobilization, all striving to work \r\ntogether in synergy with the local authorities and \r\nspecialized agencies of the central Government. \r\n Despite the suffering that the Haitian people are \r\nenduring today because of the cumulative effect of the \r\ndisasters that befell them, I cannot help turning my \r\nthoughts to our neighbours, countries such as Cuba, the \r\nDominican Republic, Mexico, our brother nations in \r\nthe Caribbean Community and even some States on the \r\nsouthern coast of the United States that have also \r\nsuffered considerable damage as a result of those first \r\nhurricanes of the season — and I stress, the first \r\nhurricanes of the season. How can we not remember \r\neither the sight of the disasters that have struck India, \r\nBangladesh and other regions of the Asian continent?  \r\n However, beyond those calamities that we could, \r\nquite easily, attribute to nature, how can we ignore \r\nother disasters for which we humans are directly \r\nresponsible through war and the destruction that we \r\nbring about with such determination in various areas of \r\nthe world? To all citizens of those countries affected by \r\nthe violence of men and by natural disasters, to their \r\nfamilies and their representatives here at this \r\nAssembly, on behalf of the Haitian people I address my \r\nbest wishes for courage in their reconstruction efforts \r\nand in their quest for peace and happiness. And I can \r\nassure them of our feeling of solidarity and fraternity \r\nin that effort. \r\n While I salute that huge wave of generosity \r\ntowards my country and am grateful for that solidarity, \r\nrecognizing it was necessary for the immediate needs \r\nof those affected, I cannot fail to draw attention to the \r\nconcerns that it raises for Haitians. I am worried \r\nbecause I know how deep-rooted our problems are. I \r\nam concerned because I am apprehensive about the \r\ntime when that solidarity, exhausted in the first wave of \r\nhumanitarian compassion, will leave us, as always, \r\nalone — really alone — in the face of new disasters, to \r\nsee as if in a ritual, the same mobilization exercises. \r\n I am concerned because the Haitians risk finding \r\nthemselves alone in ensuring the only real task that \r\nneeds undertaking today: that of rebuilding the country. \r\nWe must rebuild its production capacity and social \r\nfabric and give our young people a new dream, the \r\npoor new hope, and our citizens of all political leanings \r\nand all social strata new confidence. We need a \r\nreconstruction project thought out in a systematic \r\napproach and able to count on genuine solidarity to \r\nmobilize the necessary resources for its \r\nimplementation. \r\n That is why we are sceptical with regard to \r\nimported food aid and the traditional way in which it is \r\ncarried out. We have to break this paradigm of charity \r\nin our approach to international cooperation, for \r\ncharity has never helped any country to emerge from \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n The Native Americans that lived in our country \r\nand the Africans that replaced them helped a large part \r\nof humanity to amass its current wealth. We are simple \r\nworkers who have been moulded by hard labour and \r\nblessed with a keen sense for commerce and creating \r\nbusinesses.  \r\n If the international community wants to do \r\nsomething useful with Haitians, that would be to help \r\nus use our potential. The liberalization of trade can be \r\nbeneficial to humanity, particularly to the poor, who \r\nhave the ability to produce for a greater market. But \r\nthis liberalization must be done without hypocrisy or \r\nduping anyone. It must be carried out on the basis of \r\nclear, transparent rules that are the same for everyone, \r\nand the powers that promote them must begin by \r\nrespecting those rules themselves. \r\n Setting up and maintaining genuine productive \r\ncapacities and trading under fair conditions are the \r\ninitial conditions that would enable poor people to \r\nescape from the chains of poverty. The day when \r\ndevelopment aid aligns itself with these criteria, the \r\nfight against poverty and hunger will really turn a \r\ncorner in this world of ours. \r\n We will then see that the poor are not as poor as \r\nall that. We will see that they have available to them \r\nassets that political parties, institutions and cooperation \r\nprogrammes are not sufficiently making use of. We all \r\nrealize that the lands and the unregistered houses the \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n5 08-52272 \r\n \r\npoor possess and the informal businesses they are \r\ninvolved in are also capital that can legitimately \r\ncirculate in the economy and participate in the creation \r\nof new wealth. \r\n This system simply has to be formalized. And we \r\nhave to give property title to those who own those \r\nlands and those houses. We also have to formalize this \r\ntrade. I have begun discussions with some of our \r\npartners to move quickly to a thorough evaluation of \r\nnew needs created by the damage to our infrastructure \r\nwith a view to developing a comprehensive \r\nreconstruction plan, which will serve as the conductor \r\nfor cooperation efforts with our country.  \r\n Last Tuesday, on the occasion of the opening of \r\nthe general debate of the sixty-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly (5th meeting), I listened very \r\ncarefully to the opening statement of the President. The \r\ncreation of the United Nations was an important \r\nconquest in the history of mankind’s struggle to find a \r\nremedy for poverty and to build a world of peace based \r\non equality and respect for everyone’s rights. The \r\nOrganization remains the privileged place for debating \r\nthe problems of our world and for allowing the voices \r\nof the poor and of those left behind to be heard. We \r\ncannot allow its work to be hindered by its inability to \r\ntake into account the voice of the majority. We cannot \r\nallow its agencies to exist only for themselves, \r\nrelegating to second place their primary mission of \r\nservice. \r\n I agree with the President that our Organization \r\nneeds profound reform so that it becomes more \r\neffective, more transparent and genuinely democratic. \r\nIf it fails to accomplish this, the United Nations risks \r\nbeing resented by the small and derided by the big. We \r\ndo not need that in these difficult and uncertain days, \r\nwhen our planet is being put to a severe test by a \r\ncombination of crises of all kinds, multidimensional \r\ncrises whose solution will depend on our collective \r\ncapacity to deal with them effectively, equitably and \r\nwith solidarity. \r\n The announced high-level dialogue on the \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations, if approached \r\nwith courage and determination, will put us on the road \r\nto changing its structures and its way of functioning. \r\nSuch reforms can only be a source of inspiration and a \r\nmodel for small countries, stricken like us by long-\r\nstanding difficulties, for ending institutional fragility \r\nand arriving at political stability and a fully \r\nfunctioning rule of law.  \r\n This Assembly is among those to whom fate has \r\nentrusted the destiny of our planet. The world that is \r\nbeing remoulded around us is a world in which wealth \r\nand poverty can no longer be confined within closed \r\nspaces, separated by impassable borders. Climate \r\nchange has no borders. Viruses and diseases are elusive \r\nundocumented visitors. The hunger of the poor is a \r\nthreat and will continue to threaten the happiness of the \r\nrich. \r\n The question that we have to collectively ask \r\nourselves today is this: will we perish together because \r\nwe were not able to take up our mission together with \r\ncourage, or will we agree to mobilize for a new plan \r\nfor humanity under a new form of governance, one that \r\nis responsible and based on solidarity, in order to save \r\nour beautiful planet, and to give our children the \r\nopportunity to build a better world? \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. René Garcia Préval, President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Kalkot Matas Kelekele, President of \r\nthe Republic of Vanuatu \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nVanuatu. \r\n  Mr. Kalkot Matas Kelekele, President of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Kalkot Matas Kelekele, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Vanuatu, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Kelekele: It gives me extreme pleasure \r\nto extend my congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election. I read with keen interest \r\nthe United Nations news report of His Excellency’s \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session. I note well what he said on 4 June \r\nthis year, following his election (see A/62/PV.99): for \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 6 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations to be more effective, it must be \r\nwhat its name implies — an organization of nations \r\nunited, not nations dispersed or, even worse, \r\nsubjugated. Our nations must be united in the struggle \r\nto democratize the United Nations, united in their \r\ndetermination to preserve the world for the sake of \r\npresent and future generations from the scourge of war \r\namong Member States, and from acts of aggression.  \r\n I congratulate him and the Vice-Presidents on \r\ntheir election to lead the General Assembly. I believe \r\nthat Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann’s election, as a leader in \r\nhis own right, as a Christian priest and as a God-\r\nfearing servant of the Republic of Nicaragua, to the \r\npresidency of the Assembly is timely in these \r\nchallenging days. \r\n May I also extend my appreciation to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his successful leadership \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \r\n I am deeply honoured to be the first President of \r\nthe Republic of Vanuatu to address this Assembly, \r\nsince it is the first time that a Head of State of Vanuatu \r\nhas attended the United Nations since our admission to \r\nthe Organization in 1981. In this respect, please allow \r\nme also to extend my congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his appointment and on his keen \r\ncommitment to revitalizing the United Nations. \r\n I am humbled and privileged to stand before the \r\nsixty-third General Assembly to share some words and \r\nthoughts on behalf of the people of Vanuatu. Twenty-\r\nseven years ago, on 15 September 1981, Vanuatu \r\nbecame the 155th Member of the United Nations \r\nfamily. On that same day, our first and longest-serving \r\nPrime Minister and the founding father of our nation — \r\nthe late doctor, chief and priest, Father Walter Hadye \r\nLini — spoke to the Assembly in the name of the \r\npeople of Vanuatu, with pride, humility and gratitude. \r\nHe acknowledged the support of the United Nations \r\nthrough the active concern and assistance of the \r\nSpecial Committee of 24 on Decolonization.  \r\n Father Lini said that, because of that, the United \r\nNations has a very special place in the affections and \r\nesteem of the people of Vanuatu. He also expressed our \r\nnation’s debt of gratitude to a great number of the \r\ncountries represented in the Assembly, which assisted \r\nour nation’s difficult progress towards independence. \r\n In the same spirit I call on the United Nations to \r\ncontinue to pursue the interests of those countries and \r\npeoples that continue their struggle for freedom and to \r\nwin a permanent place among us. The United Nations \r\nis the Organization of the family of independent \r\nsovereign nations and peoples of the world. It must \r\nstand firm to promote peace, security and equality \r\nthroughout the world.  \r\n The world’s majority has accepted the \r\nphenomenon of climate change as a reality and no \r\nlonger an academic theory. From Kyoto to Bali, that \r\nobservation has been consistently repeated. \r\n The increase in the occurrence of natural \r\ncalamities and their destructive powers are a stark \r\nreminder of the increasing vulnerability of today’s \r\nglobal environment, where nature respects no \r\nboundaries. The severe impact of natural disasters will \r\nconstantly remind us of the harsh experiences and \r\ncritical development challenges confronting many of \r\nthe island countries. \r\n I join my colleagues from the Pacific region in \r\nour call to the international community for more \r\nconcerted action in addressing climate change as a \r\nsecurity issue. Unless the present trend of global \r\nwarming is reversed through sincere and concerted \r\ninternational action through the United Nations \r\nframework, some of our Pacific colleague nations will \r\nbe submerged. If such a tragedy should happen, then \r\nthe United Nations and its members will have failed in \r\ntheir first and most basic duty to a Member and its \r\ninnocent people, as stated in Article 1 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n In 2003, Vanuatu’s economic growth rebounded \r\nto 3.2 per cent from -2.6 per cent and -7.4 per cent in \r\n2001 and 2002 respectively. Continued growth was \r\nrecorded in 2004 and 2005, with a published growth \r\nrate of 5.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent respectively, \r\ndriven mainly by growth in the service sector and, in \r\nparticular, tourism. \r\n As members know, a dimension of the least \r\ndeveloped country (LDC) status is the tri-annual \r\nreview by the Economic and Social Council of the list \r\nof least developed countries with the view to \r\nrecommending countries for graduation out of or \r\ninclusion in the group of least developed countries. It \r\nis in that regard that I wish to bring to the attention of \r\nour Assembly to an area of serious concern to the \r\nGovernments of Vanuatu and of several other small \r\nisland developing States of the Pacific. \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n7 08-52272 \r\n \r\n It is our view that the current graduation rule \r\nposes a systemic issue that could easily be resolved if \r\nMember States were willing to recognize its \r\nimportance to countries such as Vanuatu and other \r\nPacific nations. The decision to graduate a country \r\nfrom LDC status, in our view, must imply the \r\nrecognition of undisputed sustainable socio-economic \r\nprogress in the country. The criteria the United Nations \r\nrelies on to arrive at a decision are by and large sound \r\nand fair, and I will briefly recall them: first, one \r\nexpects the country to enjoy a higher income per \r\ncapita; secondly, the country’s human assets or human \r\ncapital is expected to have made significant progress; \r\nand thirdly, the country ought to have achieved greater \r\nresilience to external shocks — in other words, to have \r\nbecome less vulnerable economically. \r\n A country is recommended for graduation if it \r\nmeets any two of those three criteria. In other words, \r\nthe graduation rule implicitly postulates that all three \r\ncriteria are equally important. If a country, no matter \r\nhow vulnerable, has risen to a level of per capita \r\nincome above $900, which is not difficult in a small \r\nState, and enjoys improved human capital, it is \r\nassumed that that country has become structurally \r\nstronger and is now ready to pursue its development \r\nefforts without LDC treatment. \r\n Vanuatu and other Pacific countries believe it is \r\ncritical to recognize the vulnerability criterion as the \r\nparamount criterion and accordingly give it \r\nprominence. It is indeed the only criterion that \r\nultimately matters to small and vulnerable States such \r\nas ours. \r\n Vanuatu and other Pacific countries are deemed \r\neligible for graduation on the basis of their improved \r\nper capita income and improved human assets. They \r\nremain among the most vulnerable countries in the \r\nworld, both economically and environmentally, and \r\nthat must be recognized by the United Nations. Our \r\ncountries may graduate from LDC status because they \r\nhave achieved a higher per capita income performance, \r\neven though the sustainability of that income is \r\nconstantly challenged by the high vulnerability of \r\nisland economies to shocks such as frequent cyclones, \r\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions and sea-level rise. \r\n The recent hurricanes in this part of the world \r\nremind us of the destructive impact that such natural \r\nphenomena have on the development process of island \r\ncountries and LDCs. Members may be aware that the \r\n“island paradox” — when relative prosperity \r\novershadows high vulnerability — continues to be \r\ndisregarded, despite the repeated call for a reform of \r\nthe graduation rule that would make low vulnerability \r\na sine qua non or compulsory criterion. \r\n This is not the first time that Vanuatu, in \r\naddressing the Assembly, has called on the United \r\nNations to reform the way least developed countries \r\nare identified. Some 11 years ago, in 1997, a former \r\nPrime Minister called for an urgent review of the LDC \r\ngraduation criteria, which brought the United Nations \r\nto introduce a vulnerability criterion, a fair and sound \r\nmove on the part of the Organization. \r\n I reiterate Vanuatu’s plea for a reform of the \r\ngraduation rule and wish to point out that the reform \r\nwe are calling for is a mild and reasonable one, one \r\nthat could easily be adopted by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the General Assembly without \r\naltering the main components of the established \r\nmethodology. We believe the time has come for the \r\nUnited Nations to come full circle by making the same \r\ncriterion a superior one, so that no highly vulnerable \r\ncountry is forcibly reclassified and bound to lose the \r\nlevel of concessionary support of which it remains in \r\nneed. Such a reform would do justice to countries that \r\nhave not achieved the implied structural progress. \r\n We are also urging experts from the Committee \r\nfor Development Policy to seriously consider the merit \r\nof undertaking in-country visits to assess first-hand the \r\ndevelopment experiences of affected countries rather \r\nthan making conclusions on statistical indicators that \r\nare anomalous and theoretical. \r\n In 2004, the Government of Vanuatu established \r\nits Millennium Development Goals (MDG) National \r\nCommittee, which adopted a plan of action to \r\nimplement the MDGs. In its first report, in 2005, the \r\nMDG National Committee concluded that Vanuatu’s \r\noutlook for the achievement of the MDGs or their \r\nrespective targets was poor to fair. That can be \r\nattributed to poor linkages to Government priorities \r\nand inadequate allocation of resources to implement \r\nthe plan of action.  \r\n Nevertheless, we are pleased to report that in \r\ncollaboration with the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, Vanuatu is endeavouring to put in place \r\nmechanisms to operationalize its sector strategies by \r\nidentifying key issues and the  required interventions to \r\naddress them, and defining the coverage of \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 8 \r\n \r\ninterventions and their costing. We believe that, if we \r\nsucceed in doing that, we will be able to accelerate \r\nprogress on the MDGs and that, come 2015, Vanuatu \r\nwill be able to provide a more positive report to the \r\nAssembly. \r\n At the Millennium Summit, the then Prime \r\nMinister of Vanuatu, The Honourable Barak Sope \r\nMaautamate, called on the United Nations to review \r\nthe legality of the United Nations action in 1962 to \r\nendorse the New York Agreement to administer the  \r\nso-called Act of Free Choice over West Papua. \r\n The Charter of the United Nations espouses the \r\nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization’s \r\nefforts in the process of self-determination. That \r\nmanifestation calls for recognition and respect for the \r\nfundamental and inalienable rights of peoples and \r\nterritories still under colonial rule to determine their \r\nfuture. We cannot champion democracy if the United \r\nNations continues to hang this blanket of silence over \r\nthe case of West Papua, in which the United Nations \r\nitself takes part. \r\n An issue of extreme national importance is the \r\nquestion of submissions to the United Nations on the \r\nextension of continental shelves. As with some other \r\nsmaller nations, technical capacity constraints and \r\nfinancial resources have inhibited our progress on \r\nsubmissions, and therefore we are requesting that the \r\nUnited Nations consider extending the deadline for \r\nsubmissions to enable countries like Vanuatu to \r\nparticipate fully in the process. We call for the \r\nunderstanding of our development partners and urge \r\nthem to consider providing funding for that important \r\nexercise. \r\n A side issue to the question of the extension of \r\ncontinental shelves in relation to Vanuatu is that there \r\nis a dispute between Vanuatu and the French Republic, \r\nthe former colonial authority, concerning our \r\ncontinental shelves to the south of the nation.  \r\n On the question of reforms at the United Nations, \r\nwe believe that, in order to make the Organization truly \r\ndemocratic, reforms are essential to make the Security \r\nCouncil more representative of the membership as a \r\nwhole. In that respect, we believe that Japan and India \r\ndeserve permanent membership. \r\n At this critical moment of global crisis, I recall \r\nthe aphorism underpinning the foundations of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is taken from the book of the great \r\nprophet Micah and is engraved on the walls of United \r\nNations Headquarters: \r\n  “They shall beat their swords into \r\nploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. \r\nNation shall not lift up sword against nation, \r\nneither shall they learn war any more” (The Holy \r\nBible, Micah, 4:3). \r\n It is no coincidence that the theme for this \r\nAssembly is a much clearer manifestation of those \r\nprophetic words, which the United Nations has \r\nneglected over the years. As one of the smallest \r\nMembers of the United Nations family of nations, \r\nVanuatu reaffirms its commitment to building global \r\npeace and security. We also remain committed to \r\nsupporting United Nations peacekeeping missions as \r\nour modest contribution to that worthy cause. \r\n Finally, we welcome 2009 as the International \r\nYear of Reconciliation. We all hope and pray that it \r\nwill be a time for real compromises and political \r\ngoodwill. We encourage all members of our family of \r\nnations to approach 2009 with open hearts. If we are to \r\nturn the tide of tension and animosity, we must have \r\nthe courage to reconcile our differences and come \r\ntogether in those dimensions that will enhance this \r\nnoble Organization’s role in peacebuilding and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In closing, I would like to express the \r\nGovernment of Vanuatu’s gratitude to all our \r\ndevelopment partners who have generously contributed \r\nto Vanuatu’s development efforts. In particular, we \r\nwish to thank Australia, China, the European Union, \r\nNew Zealand, Japan, the United States of America and \r\nFrance. We would also like to acknowledge the support \r\nof other partners, including India, Turkey, South Korea, \r\nMalaysia, Indonesia and Canada, as well as such \r\nmultilateral institutions as the World Bank and the \r\nAsian Development Bank, and other United Nations \r\nagencies. \r\n Mr. Baugh (Jamaica), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We are living in perilous times. In our Father’s \r\nhands were we created, and to the hands of the leaders \r\nof the world He has entrusted the responsibility to \r\nensure a world safe and just for all His peoples and \r\nchildren. The world’s destiny is in our hands. That \r\nmust be our inspiration. \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n9 08-52272 \r\n \r\n May God bless the United Nations. May God \r\nbless the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \r\nMay God bless us all. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Vanuatu for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Kalkot Matas Kelekele, President of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Gabriel Ntisezerana, Second \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Burundi \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Second Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi. \r\n Mr. Gabriel Ntisezerana, Second Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Gabriel Ntisezerana, \r\nSecond Vice-President of the Republic of Burundi, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Ntisezerana (Burundi) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to join previous speakers, on \r\nbehalf of His Excellency Pierre Nkurunziza, President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi, and our entire delegation, \r\nin offering our warmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann on his outstanding election to the \r\npresidency. We congratulate the other members of the \r\nBureau as well. \r\n We would also like to pay well-deserved tribute \r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the skill and \r\nwisdom with which he guided the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session. We also take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-Moon once \r\nagain on the skill and dynamism with which he is \r\nguiding our Organization. We would also like to pay \r\nspecial tribute to his tireless devotion to the cause of \r\npeace and development in Burundi as we attempt to \r\nconsolidate peace and stability. \r\n Finally we wish to thank the United Nations \r\nIntegrated Office in Burundi. \r\n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \r\nis taking place at a time when the people of Burundi \r\nare at last enjoying the end of the war between the \r\nGovernment army and the Parti Libération du Peuple \r\nHutu-Forces nationale de libération (PALIPEHUTU-\r\nFNL). The representatives of both parties have been \r\nsitting at the same table since May, seeking to identify \r\nthe ways and means to implement the Comprehensive \r\nCeasefire Agreement signed in Tanzania on \r\n7 September 2006. Allow us to also thank the \r\ninternational community, the United Nations, the \r\nAfrican Union and the Regional Peace Initiative on \r\nBurundi for their participation in the return of the \r\nleaders of the PALIPEHUTU movement to Burundi. \r\nWe also take this opportunity to call on that movement \r\nto commit itself resolutely to the peace process, in \r\nparticular by ending its practice of forcing local \r\npopulations to supply its fighters. For its part, the \r\nGovernment of Burundi reaffirms that it will spare no \r\neffort to ensure progress in the peace process. \r\n This session is taking place three years after the \r\nestablishment of democratically elected institutions in \r\nour country, and it is the first time in our history that \r\nan elected Government has lasted more than three \r\nyears. This is an important stage in democracy. The \r\npeople in general and the Government in particular \r\nwelcome that milestone. \r\n Thanks particularly to the support of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the Government of \r\nBurundi has just launched, throughout the country, \r\ndialogue frameworks between the socio-political \r\npartners of Burundi: the leaders of political parties, \r\nmembers of Parliament, civil society and the media. \r\nThey exchange views on the current challenges to our \r\ncountry in order to reach a consensus on the way \r\ndemocracy should function in Burundi. In the \r\nframework of promoting a sound justice system and \r\nnational reconciliation, the Government will soon \r\norganize nationwide elections on the machinery for \r\ntransitional justice. \r\n Our Government is firmly committed to \r\nrespecting human rights in all their forms. That is no \r\neasy task in a country that recently emerged from a \r\ncivil war that lasted more than 15 years. Nevertheless, \r\na number of measures have been taken and others are \r\nunder way. An independent national human rights \r\ncommission and a national children’s forum will soon \r\nbe launched. Additionally, a new criminal code \r\nproviding for severe punishment for gender-based \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 10 \r\n \r\nviolence is before Parliament, which is now up and \r\nrunning normally. In the same vein, the Government \r\nhas established human rights focal points in all \r\nministerial departments and is providing training in \r\nthat area and in peace education. \r\n I note that in Burundi, security is generally good \r\nthroughout our national territory, but we are \r\nencountering certain forms of insecurity linked to \r\nattacks and killings as a result of armed robbery and \r\nland disputes. In order to control that phenomenon, the \r\nGovernment has begun to disarm the civil population. \r\nThat is a very important and difficult measure, \r\nparticularly because there is a large number of weapons \r\nin private hands. We are convinced that, unless those \r\nweapons are taken out of circulation and destroyed, \r\npeace and security will always be under threat. We \r\ntherefore count on the support of our development \r\npartners to recover all weapons and munitions, \r\nparticularly once the PALIPEHUTU-FNL combatants \r\nhave completed the integration process. \r\n Indeed, although our country is arduously \r\nrecovering from the devastating effects of civil war, its \r\ngross domestic product remains among the lowest in \r\nthe world. The purchasing power of the population has \r\nfallen and inflation has risen apace, particularly given \r\nthe international phenomenon of the generalized \r\nincrease in the price of food and oil products. \r\n In a different vein, we recently organized a \r\nnational housing and population census that will \r\nprovide us with reliable data, without which it would \r\nbe difficult to carry out sustainable development \r\nprojects. The results of the census will allow the \r\nGovernment to improve the drafting of school and \r\nhealth policies, to which we pay particular attention, as \r\nevidenced by the measures already taken to establish \r\nfree health care for children under the age of five and \r\nwomen at childbirth, as well as free basic education. \r\n The Government has negotiated and launched \r\nmacroeconomic and structural reforms that our \r\ndevelopment partners support. Those reforms are \r\naimed at macroeconomic stabilization, the privatization \r\nof State enterprises, and bank and monetary \r\nmanagement that is compatible with sustainable \r\ngrowth. \r\n The Government is determined to fight corruption \r\nand tax fraud, and to promote real transparency in the \r\nmanagement of public wealth. Allow me to recall that \r\nan anti-corruption law has been enacted and that an \r\nanti-corruption brigade is now operating. The public \r\noversight body is playing its role and we welcome the \r\nconsiderable contribution made by civil society \r\norganizations. \r\n Burundi welcomes the ratification of the Pact on \r\nSecurity, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes \r\nRegion by nine members of the International \r\nConference on the Great Lakes Region. We will, of \r\ncourse, pursue measures to ensure that all member \r\nStates ratify the Pact. \r\n We recall that Burundi joined the East African \r\nCommunity (EAC) in July 2007. As I address this \r\nAssembly, nine Burundian members of Parliament \r\nrepresent my country in the Legislative Assembly of \r\nthe Community. That integration represents certain \r\nchallenges for the people and Government of Burundi, \r\nparticularly with respect to the imminent creation of a \r\ncommon market and a customs union, to culminate in \r\nthe establishment of a political federation. We take this \r\nopportunity to express our gratitude to the States \r\nmembers of EAC, which understand the difficulties \r\nfacing a country emerging from conflict, such as \r\nBurundi, and have implemented measures to assist our \r\nintegration. Of course, we also count on the support of \r\nour development partners to help us in all areas of \r\nintegration that we consider to be strategic for the \r\npolitical stability and development of the countries of \r\nthe subregion. \r\n Maintaining peace and security is a multidimensional \r\ntask subject to the many challenges that our Organization \r\nis called upon to address. These include conflict \r\nprevention and resolution, combating terrorism, \r\ncombating the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons and combating poverty, hunger and disease, \r\nincluding the HIV/AIDS pandemic. \r\n The United Nations is mobilizing many efforts \r\nand resources to meet those challenges. While it is true \r\nthat considerable progress has been achieved, our \r\nOrganization still has much to do, because the way \r\nforward is still long. We should also point out that \r\nbloody conflicts and hotbeds of tension remain, \r\nincluding in Somalia, Darfur, Iraq, Afghanistan and the \r\nMiddle East, et cetera. Terrorism is gaining ground all \r\nthe time and is causing more death than conventional \r\nwar. But we should not be discouraged. On the \r\ncontrary, our Organization must demonstrate the \r\ncapacity to prevent this type of conflict and provide \r\neffective remedies for the ills threatening humanity.  \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n11 08-52272 \r\n \r\n In the name of international solidarity, Burundi \r\nhas decided to make its modest contribution towards \r\nresolving some of those crises, by providing military \r\nobservers and police officers in Darfur and Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, and to military peacekeeping contingents in \r\nSomalia in the framework of operations established by \r\nthe African Union. \r\n Burundi enthusiastically welcomed the global \r\nchallenge represented by the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), which were adopted in 2000 and \r\nreaffirmed in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\nDocument (resolution 60/1). We are pleased to report \r\nthat, through its policy of free primary education and \r\nhealth care for children under five years and women in \r\nchildbirth, Burundi is achieving successes that deserve \r\nsupport. While thanking those countries and peoples \r\nwho have been of such great help to us since the launch \r\nof the policy in 2005, we would like to call for \r\ninternational solidarity, because the policy requires \r\nconsiderable Government resources that our country \r\ncannot acquire on its own.  \r\n Indeed, the World Solidarity Fund for the \r\npromotion of social and human development and the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \r\ndo exist, but unfortunately, despite those initiatives the \r\nresults are still modest. We therefore appeal to \r\ndeveloped countries that have not yet done so to keep \r\ntheir promise to allocate 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome to official development assistance.  \r\n Special attention should be given to problems \r\nincluding putting order into the international financial \r\nmarkets, the need to increase investment in Africa, the \r\nrational management of water and energy resources, \r\ntechnology transfer, international trade agreements, \r\nclimate change and the management of toxic waste. \r\n It is more urgent than ever to harmonize the \r\nprocedures and instruments for achieving our common \r\nobjectives, including efforts to counteract hunger, \r\nreduce poverty worldwide and to ensure peacebuilding. \r\nOtherwise, we will witness the persistence of \r\nphenomena including the tragedy of clandestine \r\nemigration, the brain drain, heightened crime and other \r\nills.  \r\n In closing, I wish to say that we hope that a \r\nminimum of political will and strengthened \r\ninternational solidarity will enable the United Nations \r\nto find appropriate solutions to the scourges affecting \r\nour era. Long live international solidarity. Long live \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Second Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Burundi for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Gabriel Ntisezerana, Second Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.  \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief \r\nAdviser of the Caretaker Government of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Chief Adviser of the Caretaker \r\nGovernment of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. \r\n Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief Adviser of the \r\nCaretaker Government of the People’s Republic \r\nof Bangladesh, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, \r\nChief Adviser of the Caretaker Government of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Ahmed (Bangladesh): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his \r\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I would like to \r\nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his very \r\neffective leadership in promoting global peace, security \r\nand development. \r\n I take this opportunity to deliver this statement \r\nalso on behalf of the least developed countries (LDCs). \r\nThis has been a difficult year for many LDCs, amid \r\nrising food prices and a looming economic slowdown. \r\nBut we have remained resolute in confronting the crisis in \r\na spirit of mutual understanding, support and cooperation, \r\nas enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \r\n My statement today will address three \r\ninterrelated issues: food security, democracy and \r\ndevelopment. These issues are inextricably linked to \r\none another and are of fundamental importance to the \r\nwelfare of the citizens of Bangladesh as well as other \r\nLDCs.  \r\n We have witnessed during the course of this year \r\nan extraordinary rise in food and energy prices, which \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 12 \r\n \r\nhas undermined the food security of many least \r\ndeveloped economies. This experience should \r\nstrengthen our resolve to look for long-term solutions \r\nleading to a world free of hunger. In the twenty-first \r\ncentury, food security for all citizens in the world must \r\nbe acknowledged not just as a development imperative, \r\nbut as a moral imperative. Each and every human life \r\nis sacred, and it is our collective duty to provide \r\nadequate food and nutrition to people throughout the \r\nworld. \r\n The recent global rise in food prices has been \r\nacutely felt in Bangladesh, even though imports \r\naccount for a very small percentage of our total cereal \r\nconsumption. Domestic rice prices spiked by nearly \r\n60 per cent during the year through February 2008, \r\nagainst the backdrop of two devastating floods and a \r\ntropical cyclone that destroyed one of our key harvests. \r\nFor a country like Bangladesh, where roughly 40  \r\nper cent of the population lives below the poverty line \r\nand where poor households spend as much as \r\n70 per cent of their income on food items, such a steep \r\nincrease in food prices has had significant adverse \r\neffects on food security, poverty alleviation and human \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Food insecurity can disrupt the core of a \r\ndemocratic polity and derail its development priorities. \r\nThe cost of food insecurity is measured not only by \r\ndeprivation, but also by increased instability, which \r\ncan be very costly for a society. While the free market \r\nremains an incomparably powerful tool for the efficient \r\nallocation of resources, markets are often imperfect, \r\nand no Government can stand idle and hope that the \r\nprivate sector will resolve a food crisis. Making food \r\navailable to all, and at affordable prices, remains a \r\ncardinal responsibility of all Governments. In \r\nBangladesh, we took this responsibility very seriously \r\nand delivered rice to our citizens through a public \r\ndistribution system, in an effort to ensure that no one \r\nwent to bed hungry. \r\n Soon after assuming office in January 2007, our \r\nGovernment announced a road map for holding a truly \r\ndemocratic and meaningful election. That was no easy \r\ntask, as decades of corruption had seriously \r\nundermined both our democracy and our economy. \r\nCorruption’s ill effects corroded our vital public \r\ninstitutions, and the cost was ultimately borne by the \r\nordinary citizens of Bangladesh, who could ill afford it. \r\nMy Government is determined to ensure that \r\ncorruption does not imperil the rights of the \r\nunderprivileged and that, in future, our democracy \r\nensures the good of all Bangladeshis. Our fight against \r\ncorruption has been the first step in a long and difficult \r\nprocess, and we believe that the work will continue \r\nunder the auspices of the Independent Anti-Corruption \r\nCommission, which was created as an institutional \r\nbulwark against corruption. Legal action was initiated \r\nagainst corrupt individuals, but we never compromised \r\ndue process and judicial independence. \r\n The foundation of a democracy rests on a \r\ncompact between the State and its citizens. That begins \r\nby ensuring that each and every eligible citizen can \r\nvote, freely and without fear, and that each and every \r\nvote is counted. To that end, my Government has \r\ncompleted the monumental task of electronically \r\nregistering over 80 million voters with photographs \r\nand fingerprints. That was achieved in just 11 months \r\nand is a feat that I believe is without precedent \r\nanywhere in the world. Our Election Commission \r\ntrained over 500,000 election workers, deployed over \r\n10,000 laptop computers, webcams and fingerprint \r\nscanners and set up over 90,000 registration centres to \r\nensure that every eligible voter could have his or her \r\nphotograph and fingerprints digitally captured. \r\nMultiple layers of safeguards were put in place to \r\nensure that the new voters list was flawless. \r\n In addition to creating a world-class photo voters \r\nlist, we issued national identity cards to all those who \r\nregistered. The Election Commission, with the \r\nnewfound independent authority granted to it by our \r\nGovernment, completed that task in record speed with \r\nthe support of the Bangladesh army. Our armed \r\nservices personnel — many of whom have shown their \r\ndeep and abiding commitment to the ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations through their service in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations — provided critical logistical \r\nsupport. Their experience, we believe, could be \r\ninvaluable to supporting and strengthening democracy \r\nin post-conflict environments. Our success with the \r\nvoters list was the result not just of civil-military \r\ncooperation, but also international cooperation. We are \r\ndeeply appreciative of the technical assistance of the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme for that \r\nproject and the financial support of our development \r\npartners. \r\n An election is only the first pillar of democratic \r\ngovernance. During the past 20 months, my \r\nGovernment has relentlessly worked to shore up \r\ndemocracy’s other pillars. We have made the judiciary \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n13 08-52272 \r\n \r\nfully independent. My Government has established the \r\nNational Human Rights Commission to protect and \r\npromote the fundamental rights of all our citizens. We \r\nhave enacted a right to information law, which will \r\nhelp provide the transparency that is necessary to a \r\nwell-functioning democracy. We have, in consultation \r\nwith the political parties, amended and strengthened \r\nthe Representation of People’s Order, under which \r\nforthcoming elections will be held. That law and \r\nregulations under it will require the registration of \r\npolitical parties for elections, ensure intra-party \r\ndemocracy and implement campaign finance reforms \r\nthat will limit the influence of corrupt money in our \r\npolitical system. \r\n Just last month, the Bangladesh Election \r\nCommission organized the successful holding of some \r\nlocal and mayoral elections. That marked a new \r\nbeginning in our electoral process, and our citizens \r\nwere able to exercise their franchise without undue \r\ninfluence of money or muscle power. The elections \r\nwere held without disruption and drew an \r\nunprecedented number of voters. Let me reiterate here \r\nthat my Government is fully committed to holding free \r\nand fair parliamentary elections on 18 December 2008, \r\nas announced last week. We are confident that all \r\npolitical parties will participate in the elections. \r\n Few nations face the challenges that we face in \r\nBangladesh for mere survival. Our development gains, \r\nachieved through the work of years and decades, can \r\nbe wiped out in a matter of hours. One cyclone can \r\npush hundreds of thousands of people back below the \r\npoverty line. Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to \r\nclimate change, given that we are a low-lying delta in \r\none of the highest rainfall regions of the world. There \r\nis growing concern that an irreversible climatic shift \r\nwill displace tens of millions of our people. By some \r\nestimates, a one-metre sea-level rise would submerge \r\nabout one third of the total area of Bangladesh. Given \r\nour population and its vulnerabilities, that would result \r\nin the greatest humanitarian crisis in history. Inaction is \r\nsimply no longer an option. It is nothing less than a \r\nbasic moral imperative that countries that have \r\ncontributed little to this crisis, such as Bangladesh, not \r\nbe left alone and unsupported to suffer the most from \r\nits consequences. \r\n Adaptation is necessary, but it may not be \r\nsufficient to cope with the unavoidable impacts of \r\nclimate change. Countries like Bangladesh will face \r\nthe worst consequences in the absence of a legally \r\nbinding commitment on mitigation. International \r\nefforts to minimize emission levels should not, \r\nhowever, disproportionately tax poorer nations. We \r\nmust have guaranteed access to appropriate mitigation \r\ntechnologies and know-how on affordable terms. We \r\nstrongly feel that the post-Kyoto agreement should set \r\nup a technology transfer board, in order to ensure that \r\nthe least developed nations have access to affordable, \r\neco-friendly technologies. Bangladesh will not be able \r\nto attain sustainable development without appropriate \r\ntechnological support in that regard. \r\n We would not have discussed the food crisis issue \r\nhere in the Assembly, if we had believed that it was a \r\none-off event. The crisis will revisit us, perhaps with \r\ngreater intensity and frequency, unless we put in place \r\nboth short- and long-term measures to prevent its \r\nrecurrence. Many of us in the developing world were \r\ndeeply encouraged when the Secretary-General \r\nresponded to our urgent request for a high-level task \r\nforce to address the current food crisis. It was also \r\ntimely and appropriate that the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations convened the High-\r\nLevel Conference on World Food Security in Rome in \r\nJune 2008. The Conference afforded us the opportunity \r\nto deliberate on systemic and non-systemic issues that \r\nexacerbated the current food crisis. \r\n Bangladesh, as representative of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, also urged the Secretary-General \r\nto look into the possibility of creating a global food \r\nbank. We suggested that the food bank could allow \r\ncountries facing a short-term shortfall in production to \r\nborrow food grains on preferential terms. Once they \r\novercame the shortfall, those countries could return the \r\nquantum to the food bank. We could also explore the \r\npossibility of determining special drawing rights for \r\neach country, using criteria such as population, level of \r\npoverty and annual variation in their level of food \r\nproduction. Such an arrangement would allow us to \r\nprevent hoarding and price gouging by speculators in \r\nanticipation of, and during, a food crisis, and we \r\nbelieve that a mechanism can be put in place to guard \r\nagainst any moral hazard issues that might arise. \r\n Since the adoption of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction in 2001, LDCs as a group, have made some \r\nprogress in their macroeconomic performance and on a \r\nfew social indicators. The progress is, however, \r\ninsufficient and uneven. More important, their \r\neconomic growth has made only a little dent in poverty. \r\nLDCs continue to face serious structural hurdles in \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 14 \r\n \r\ntheir development efforts. They remain acutely \r\nsusceptible to external economic shocks and natural \r\nand man-made disasters.  \r\n The full and effective implementation of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action has now become an \r\neven greater necessity. However, it is unlikely that we \r\nwill achieve the overarching goals of the Programme of \r\nAction and the MDGs, unless international \r\ncommitment to the LDCs in the areas of aid and trade \r\nis fully delivered.  \r\n The Brussels Programme of Action will conclude \r\nin 2010. The General Assembly is in the process of \r\npreparing for the fourth United Nations Conference on \r\nthe Least Developed Countries, to be held towards the \r\nend of the current decade. The upcoming conference \r\nwill provide an important opportunity for LDCs and \r\ntheir partners to review critically past performance, \r\nespecially in the areas of failures and weak \r\nimplementation. That will help us develop a new, \r\naction-oriented strategic framework for the next decade \r\nto assist the LDCs in their development efforts. I call \r\nupon Member States to extend full and effective \r\nsupport for the successful holding of the next United \r\nNations conference on the LDCs. \r\n Bangladesh is in the midst of a profound change \r\nthat we believe is also relevant to people all around the \r\nworld, especially to those fighting poverty, corruption \r\nand underdevelopment. As with any process of change, \r\nit is not without setbacks and will take time to \r\ncomplete, but in the end we remain confident of our \r\nsuccess. Our goal is to strengthen democracy in \r\nBangladesh, and my Government has done everything \r\nin its power over the course of the past 20 months to \r\nwork towards that end. \r\n I have spoken about the remarkable achievement \r\nwith our voters list, which will ensure that the elections \r\nthis December and every election thereafter can be free \r\nand fair; and I have also discussed some of the \r\nfundamental institutional reforms that we have \r\nundertaken to bolster the foundations of democracy. \r\nMany countries around the world are in their own ways \r\ngoing through similar processes, and we hope to share \r\nour experiences in order to help them, as we ourselves \r\nhave benefited from the support of the international \r\ncommunity and organizations like the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chief Adviser of The \r\nCaretaker Government of the People’s Republic of \r\nBangladesh for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief Adviser of The \r\nCaretaker Government of the People’s Republic \r\nof Bangladesh, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Right Honourable Pushpa \r\nKamal Dahal “Prachanda”, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal. \r\n The Right Honourable Pushpa Kamal Dahal \r\n“Prachanda”, Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Right Honourable \r\nPushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Dahal “Prachanda” (Nepal): At the outset, \r\nallow me to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly and to assure him of my delegation’s full \r\ncooperation in discharging his responsibilities. I also \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive \r\nreport on the work of the United Nations (A/63/1) and \r\nhis positive reference to the situation prevailing in \r\nNepal. \r\n It is, indeed, a historic opportunity for me to \r\naddress this Assembly as the first Prime Minister of \r\nNepal, the newest republic of the world. As I stand \r\nhere in front of the global leadership, I think of the \r\nlong struggle that I and my party waged with single-\r\nmindedness for the liberation of the common man from \r\nthe clutches of the age-old suppression, deprivation, \r\nmarginalization and outright negligence of the \r\npreviously existing polity. My fellow countrymen and \r\nwomen, toiling in the mountains and valleys, working \r\nday and night in the lowlands and the urban areas and \r\nyet unable to ensure even the simple necessities of life \r\nfor their families, had a hope and expectation that one \r\nday they would lead a decent life with equal rights and \r\nopportunities and be recognized as respected citizens \r\nof the country.  \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n15 08-52272 \r\n \r\n We are at that significant turning point in the \r\npolitical history of Nepal, and I and my party are proud \r\nto be the leading force of that positive historical \r\nchange. Today, I see a great hope in the glinting eyes of \r\nthe Dalit boy from the far west, the downtrodden \r\nwoman from the indigenous nationality in the east, the \r\nhomeless Tharu girl, the landless Madhesi and other \r\npeasants from the hills living under thatched roofs. I \r\nintend to lead them with conviction and sincerity in a \r\nnew journey of sustainable peace and equitable \r\nprogress in a modern Nepal. I have, therefore, the \r\nhonour and great privilege of bringing with me to the \r\nAssembly the greetings and best wishes of the people \r\nand the Government of that new Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Nepal. \r\n Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \r\nin November 2006, after a decade-long armed struggle, \r\nwe began our peace process and eventually held \r\nelections to the Constituent Assembly in April this \r\nyear. People overwhelmingly voted for my party and \r\nmade us the single largest political party in the \r\nAssembly with great hope and expectations. At its first \r\nmeeting, the Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a \r\nfederal democratic republic, formally ending the 240-\r\nyear-old monarchy and creating a new opportunity to \r\ntransform the old feudalistic State into an inclusive and \r\nfederal new Nepal. That was in keeping with the long-\r\nstanding aspirations of the Nepalese people. They \r\nvoted in favour of the change and transformation that \r\nmy own party had fought for over so many years. After \r\nthe historic political transformation, our agenda now is \r\nto bring about an equally historic socio-economic \r\ntransformation of the country.  \r\n Today, I must report with all humility that our \r\nConstituent Assembly is the most inclusive representative \r\nbody, of which all marginalized, oppressed ethnic \r\ncommunities, indigenous nationalities, Dalits, the \r\ndisadvantaged and people from the backward regions and \r\ncommunities are members, which will herald a new \r\nbeginning in the country. That may very well be an \r\nexample of representativeness to the world in the first \r\ndecade of the twenty-first century. \r\n The Government is committed to restoring law \r\nand order, providing immediate relief to the people \r\naffected by the conflict, fighting against the cancerous \r\ngrowth of corruption and starting an economic \r\nrecovery package, focusing on pro-poor growth, \r\ninfrastructure development and public-private \r\npartnership. The Government will build an effective \r\npartnership with the international community in \r\ncreating an atmosphere for unleashing a new socio-\r\neconomic transformation, for which the Nepalese \r\npeople have so long been waiting. \r\n Nepal’s peace process is unique in its \r\ncharacteristics and is based on multiparty democracy, \r\ninclusiveness, accommodation, dialogue and the \r\nrecognition of the people as the ultimate arbiter. It is \r\nthe outcome of our own creative disposition towards \r\npeace, and we feel that it can also serve as a reference \r\nmodel for peace elsewhere. \r\n We appreciate the continued support of the \r\nUnited Nations for the peace process, especially in \r\nmonitoring the management of arms and personnel \r\nthrough the United Nations Mission in Nepal. The \r\nUnited Nations Mission has undertaken its mandated \r\ntasks well. I also take this opportunity to thank our \r\nneighbours, friends and donors for their continued \r\nsupport in favour of the peace process and the \r\ninstitutionalization of democracy in Nepal. I am \r\nconfident they are doing so to unleash Nepal’s \r\ndevelopment potential, in accordance with the wish of \r\nthe Nepalese people. \r\n As we proceed in the peace process within the \r\ncountry, new problems in the form of the global food \r\ncrisis, rising oil prices and imminent danger from \r\nclimate change stare us in the face. Those challenges \r\nalso undermine our achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). There will be no success \r\nin achieving the MDGs without ensuring that they are \r\nachieved in the least developed countries. Solemn \r\npledges were made in the 2000 Millennium Declaration \r\nand at the 2002 International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development held in Monterrey. Many of those \r\ncommitments are yet to be fulfilled and the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nremains elusive to most of the world’s poor people. \r\n The United Nations agenda today has to tackle \r\nthose development challenges and many other issues, \r\nsuch as religious extremism, terrorism, the \r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass \r\ndestruction; transnational crimes, such as drugs, human \r\ntrafficking and money-laundering; continuing conflicts \r\nwithin and among States; and gross violations of \r\nhuman rights, genocide, war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity. It is more than obvious that many of those \r\nglobal problems require global solutions. Together, we \r\ncan rise to the occasion and adopt the vision and \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 16 \r\n \r\nstrategy that the founders of the United Nations charted \r\nin the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nOrganization. Multilateralism, not unilateralism, is the \r\nanswer to those problems. \r\n Least developed countries like Nepal are faced \r\nwith a special predicament in their development \r\nefforts. We are trapped in a vicious circle of poverty. \r\nFor many historical reasons, we have low economic \r\ngrowth, low productivity, underdeveloped industries \r\nand traditional agriculture. Because of the low level of \r\nsocial indicators and fewer opportunities, conflict and \r\ncrisis continue to be prevalent in those countries.  \r\n Today, the growing gap between rich and poor \r\nwithin countries as well as between nations is a sure \r\nsign of a looming disaster. It is also inhuman and \r\nunjust that such a high level of inequality is still so \r\ncommon in this age of human achievements, \r\nabundance and progress. Equally important is the fact \r\nthat islands of prosperity in a sea of poverty are not \r\nsustainable and certainly not in the enlightened self-\r\ninterest of even the developed countries themselves, as \r\nthey breed resentment, fuel conflict and undermine \r\ntheir own progress in the long run. They also go \r\nagainst the fundamental spirit of the United Nations.  \r\n Because of the peculiar nature of the least \r\ndeveloped countries and their high level of \r\nvulnerability, I strongly urge that the issues of least \r\ndeveloped countries be looked at by the United Nations \r\nseparately and addressed with special and focused \r\nprogrammes. They should be ensured dedicated \r\nsupport and cooperation if we want to make our world \r\nthe just and inclusive place that the United Nations so \r\nproudly espouses. \r\n We are not only least developed, but also \r\nlandlocked. That is a double disadvantage in our efforts \r\nto fulfil our development aspirations. In fact, we feel \r\nfurther marginalized by the overwhelming impact of \r\nthe downside of globalization and the high cost of \r\ntrade. We want full implementation of the respective \r\nglobal compacts, the Brussels Programme of Action for \r\nthe Least Developed Countries and the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action for the landlocked developing \r\ncountries. In particular, I would like to highlight the \r\nneed on the part of our developed country partners to \r\nfulfil their commitments and pledges in allocating a \r\ncertain percentage of their gross national product to \r\nthose countries and in making trade concessions, debt \r\nrelief and other capacity-building measures available in \r\naccordance with those compacts. On our part, I would \r\nlike to undertake that Nepal will fulfil its pledge to \r\nown its development programmes in accordance with \r\nits national priorities, including those on poverty \r\nreduction and pro-poor governance policies. \r\n We need to protect our people from the growing \r\nvulnerabilities of climate change. For example, in my \r\nown country, Nepal, melting glaciers and shifting \r\nweather patterns are threatening life-support systems, \r\nundermining the sustainability of agriculture and \r\nunleashing extreme climate-induced disasters, such as \r\nfrequent floods and landslides. The Himalayan range \r\nprovides life-supporting water downstream for more \r\nthan 1 billion people. Mount Everest, as the roof of the \r\nworld, and the Himalayan range need to be protected \r\nand utilized properly to contribute to humankind as a \r\nwhole.  \r\n I therefore strongly appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to extend all necessary support and \r\ncooperation to protect and promote that pristine \r\nenvironment. We need to create a regime of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities in which the \r\ndeveloped countries will mitigate the burden of \r\nadaptation for the vulnerable countries, such as the \r\nleast developed and small islands. The world stands to \r\nbenefit from addressing climate change if we are able \r\nto harness the tremendous potentials of Nepal’s \r\nhydropower, which is a renewable and clean source of \r\nenergy. To that end, Nepal is ready to invite and \r\nencourage investment in its hydropower projects. \r\n I am pleased that the United Nations Regional \r\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the \r\nPacific is now operational in Kathmandu 20 years after \r\nit was established by this Assembly. I thank all \r\nMembers, countries of the region, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the officials of the Secretariat for the \r\nsmooth relocation of the Centre from New York to \r\nKathmandu. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nreiterate Nepal’s commitment to making the Centre \r\nsuccessful through the cooperation of all countries \r\nconcerned. \r\n Over the years, peacekeeping has evolved as the \r\nsoul of the United Nations. With that in mind, since \r\n1958 Nepal has regularly placed its peacekeepers at the \r\ncall of the United Nations. We are celebrating the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of Nepal’s continuous participation \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. I take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate Nepal’s commitment to \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n17 08-52272 \r\n \r\ncontinuing to provide our troops for the cause of peace \r\nworldwide. Today, Nepal is the fifth largest contributor \r\nof troops and police personnel to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. We are glad that they have \r\nearned accolades for their professional competence and \r\nperformance both at home and abroad. We consider \r\nthat to be our modest contribution to international \r\npeace and security. \r\n The enjoyment of universal human rights is \r\nabsolutely essential to creating an environment of \r\npeace, justice, democracy and development. As a \r\ndemocracy, Nepal is fully committed to protecting and \r\npromoting the human rights of its people under all \r\ncircumstances, with constitutional and legal guarantees \r\nand implementation of the international human rights \r\ninstruments to which Nepal is a party. The Government \r\nis committed to ending the environment of impunity. \r\nThe proposed truth and reconciliation commission will \r\nseek to arrive at a necessary balance between peace \r\nand justice in order to ensure that justice is served and \r\nthat the centrality of the peace process is preserved. We \r\nwill continue to strengthen our National Human Rights \r\nCommission so that it can take up its statutory \r\nresponsibility for the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights in the country even more effectively. It \r\ngoes without saying that the environment for the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights in Nepal has \r\nsignificantly improved, especially after the signing of \r\nthe comprehensive peace agreement in November \r\n2006. \r\n As a least developed country that entered the \r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) not too long ago, \r\nNepal is concerned at the lack of tangible progress in \r\nnegotiations on the Doha Development Agenda. We \r\nthink that the opportunities in world trade through the \r\nmultilateral trading framework of WTO should not be \r\ndelayed any further. The least developed countries \r\ndeserve genuine duty-free and quota-free market access \r\nfor all their tradable products from all the major \r\ncountries, together with more favourable rules of origin \r\nand support for enhancing their supply-side capacity. \r\nOnly then will the Doha Round be a development \r\nround in the real sense of the word. Without the \r\nmeaningful integration of the least developed countries \r\ninto the global regime, I do not know how we can \r\nmake the global trading regime sustainable, equitable \r\nand inclusive. Similarly, the least developed countries \r\nneed more aid for trade and trade facilitation measures \r\nto enhance their trading capacity. \r\n Today, the United Nations needs to reform and \r\ndemocratize itself in order to take on the numerous \r\nchallenges in international peace and security \r\neffectively, and it should reflect the current realities of \r\nthe world. We should also give the necessary \r\ncredibility, legitimacy, competence and effectiveness to \r\nthe world body in solving global problems.  \r\n I take this opportunity to reiterate Nepal’s solemn \r\nfaith and commitment to the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. On behalf of the \r\npeople and the Government of Nepal, I pledge to work \r\nwith all States Members in a spirit of goodwill, \r\ncooperation and mutual solidarity in order to take on \r\nthe challenges that face the world. Indeed, we have \r\nadopted that spirit as one of the main tenets of Nepal’s \r\nforeign policy.  \r\n Nepal is an example of how swords can be turned \r\ninto ploughshares. That is what the United Nations is \r\ndedicated to. Therefore, as I address this Assembly \r\ntoday, I have a special feeling about the objectives and \r\nideals that the United Nations stands for and the \r\ncorrelation between those ideals and the political, \r\neconomic and social transformation that we would like \r\nto achieve in our country. May we all succeed in \r\nattaining our common objectives through our collective \r\nand sincere efforts as united and inseparable members \r\nof a single global family. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minster of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Nepal for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  The Right Honourable Pushpa Kamal Dahal \r\n“Prachanda”, Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Gordon Brown, Prime Minister \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \r\n  Mr. Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Gordon Brown, Prime \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 18 \r\n \r\nMinister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Brown (United Kingdom): It is humbling to \r\nstand before this great Assembly today. Events of \r\nrecent weeks have proved beyond doubt that we are \r\nnow in a new global age. Living through the first \r\nfinancial crisis and the first resources crisis of \r\nglobalization, we are a world not simply in transition, \r\nbut facing transformation, with change more far-\r\nreaching than anything we have seen in our lifetimes. \r\nThe challenges, the opportunities for us and the risks \r\nthat we now face come together at the global \r\ncrossroads of the United Nations, providing the focus \r\nfor debate and decision here in this General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n A predecessor of mine said that if one built the \r\npresent only in the image of the past, one would miss \r\nout entirely on the challenges of the future. It is to \r\nthose challenges of the future that I want to address my \r\nremarks today. \r\n In the next two decades, our world economy will \r\ndouble in size. That means double the opportunities \r\nand potential for more businesses, more jobs and more \r\nprosperity. Extraordinary promise and opportunity \r\nawait, but there are also wholly new insecurities and \r\npressures — global problems that will require global \r\nsolutions. \r\n The twin shocks of a global credit crunch and \r\nsoaring commodity prices lead straight to the front \r\ndoors of every family in every country, with higher oil, \r\ngas and food prices, and higher costs for credit. But \r\nbecause it is a global financial crisis and a global \r\nshortage of food and resources, it will not be resolved \r\nsimply by individual nations acting in isolation, \r\nalthough there is much that they can do themselves. It \r\nwill be solved in the end by us acting together. \r\n I want to talk about how we can work together to \r\ntackle financial instability and the intense pressure now \r\non our finite world resources. The immediate priority is \r\nto help people everywhere cope with these difficult \r\ntimes and to do so fairly. That is why, in Britain, we \r\nhave acted to help those hit hardest, assisting people \r\nwith the costs of gas and electricity, supporting \r\nhomeowners and the housing market and helping \r\npeople acquire the skills to do the new jobs of the \r\ntwenty-first century. \r\n But if we have learned anything in the past few \r\nyears about the world in which we are now living, it is \r\nthat the world we share is more interconnected than \r\never before and that the solutions have to be similarly \r\ncoordinated. \r\n First, we must do all that it takes to stabilize the \r\nstill turbulent financial markets and, in the months \r\nahead, we must work together to rebuild the world \r\nfinancial system around clear principles. In the short \r\nterm, each country is taking action to deal with the \r\nfallout of the credit crunch, and the United States of \r\nAmerica deserves support from the rest of the world as \r\nit seeks to agree on in detail what all parties agree on \r\nin principle. \r\n In Britain, we have taken decisive action to \r\npromote stability in our banking system, protecting \r\ndepositors and introducing a temporary ban on short-\r\nselling. We have already injected billions into the \r\nmarket, making in excess of £100 billion available, and \r\nannounced only last week that our special liquidity \r\nscheme will be extended until the end of January next \r\nyear. \r\n Confidence in the future is also needed to build \r\nconfidence today, and that confidence will be built by \r\nshowing that what are global problems can be \r\naddressed by globally coordinated solutions. I believe \r\nthere are five key principles behind that all nations \r\nshould unite around as we examine the future of our \r\nfinancial system. \r\n The first principle is that of transparency. People \r\nmust know what they are buying and selling, and they \r\nmust know what they are dealing with and not fear \r\nwhat might be hidden on each other’s books. We must \r\nlook at the rapid introduction of improved \r\ninternationally acceptable accounting standards and \r\ndisclosure. \r\n Secondly, there must be sound banking practice \r\nand more effective regulation that looks not just at \r\nsolvency but at liquidity, at managing and pricing risks \r\nfor bad times and for good times, together. \r\n Thirdly, there must be responsibility. No member \r\nof senior management should be able to say he or she \r\ndid not understand the risks they were running and \r\nwalk away from his or her obligations. \r\n Fourthly, there must be integrity. Most people \r\nagree that companies should align reward with stability \r\nand long-term gain because what matters is hard work, \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n19 08-52272 \r\n \r\neffort and enterprise. We should align the advice of \r\ncredit-rating agencies with the interests of the \r\ninvestors. \r\n Fifthly, just as banks are global and the flows of \r\ncapital are global, so oversight can no longer just be \r\nnational but must also include global supervision. That \r\nis why we want to work to support immediately the \r\nestablishment of international colleges for each of the \r\nlargest global financial institutions — 30 of them by \r\nthe end of the year.  \r\n The international institutions built in the wake of \r\nthe Second World War have not kept pace with the \r\nchanging global economy. We need national regulators \r\nto be cooperative, rules and principles to be consistent, \r\nand international movements of capital to be \r\ntransparent. \r\n The current era has been one of global prosperity. \r\nIt has also been an era of global turbulence, and while \r\nthere has been irresponsibility, we must now say \r\nclearly that the age of irresponsibility must be ended. \r\nWe must now build that new global financial order, \r\nfounding it on transparency, not opacity; rewarding \r\nsuccess, not excess; and responsibility, not impunity. \r\nThat order must be global, not national. \r\n Global action cannot be limited to financial \r\nstability. We must also address another problem of \r\nglobalization — the global scramble for resources. We \r\nneed global action to deal with high commodity prices \r\nand a rising global population demanding more energy. \r\nOnly by taking tough decisions on energy security and \r\nclimate change and by bringing together a new global \r\npartnership of oil producers and oil consumers can we \r\nbring stability to global energy markets and secure \r\nsustainable energy supplies for the long term. \r\n We are committed to tackling the global \r\nchallenge of climate change. Oil will of course \r\ncontinue to meet a large part of our global energy \r\nneeds for some decades to come, but over the past year \r\nwe have seen the price of oil rise to as high as $146 per \r\nbarrel before falling again to $90 in the past month — \r\na fall of nearly 40 per cent. Such high and volatile \r\nprices have a harmful impact on the global economy, \r\nand all countries surely have a shared interest in \r\navoiding such dramatic swings in the price of scarce \r\nresources. \r\n We must now therefore consider whether the \r\ncurrent international architecture can bring the more \r\ntransparent and stable energy markets this global \r\neconomy clearly needs. We must bring producers and \r\nconsumers together, build common understanding and \r\naddress the issues through meaningful and sustained \r\ndialogue. At the end of this year, I will be hosting a \r\nglobal energy summit in London, building on the \r\nmomentum generated in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to agree \r\non key areas for further action. It is only by acting \r\ntogether that we can make the most of the world’s \r\nscarce resources and harness the power of our greater \r\ninterdependence for our common good. \r\n Some say that in a time of difficulty we should \r\nlook inwards and cut aid; that we have an excuse for \r\nwalking by on the other side; and that, by our inaction, \r\nwe tolerate famine — but in today’s world, there is no \r\nother side. \r\n Africa is not part of the problem, but an \r\nindisputable part of the solution. It is only by helping \r\nAfrica to become a net exporter of food rather than a \r\nnet importer that we can hope to achieve a long-term \r\nend to soaring food prices. Only by restarting and \r\nseeing the trade talks through can we help our \r\neconomies benefit from the annual boost of \r\n$150 billion that would be achieved by removing the \r\nprotectionist trade barriers and trade-distorting \r\nsubsidies that currently cost developing countries the \r\nmost — $15 billion a year in their agricultural incomes \r\nalone. \r\n As Governments and as nations, we must respond \r\nwith courage and vision to the new insecurities that \r\nface people, because while the global changes \r\nhappening all around us are complex, the instincts they \r\nsummon up in people are not. We must resist those \r\ninstincts that are protectionist. Now is not the time to \r\npull up the drawbridge, to seek solace in isolation or to \r\nrevert to an outdated and futile protectionism. It is only \r\nby maintaining our open, flexible and dynamic \r\neconomies that we can best secure people’s jobs, \r\nhomes and standards of living in a global age.  \r\n Our global institutions have always had a \r\nsweeping ambition, set up not against a single enemy \r\nbut against poverty, conflict, injustice and intolerance, \r\nand set up in the belief that, for peace to last, \r\nprosperity must be shared. Now we must build on the \r\nidealism of the era that created those institutions and \r\nchange and evolve those institutions to meet the \r\nchallenges of the global age. This United Nations is \r\nwhere the world turns to confront some of its greatest \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 20 \r\n \r\nchallenges. It is where international law is made, where \r\nthe most acute political problems are addressed, and \r\nwhere the hopes of the world for a better future \r\nultimately rest. \r\n For the past 40 years, it has been this United \r\nNations that has been the key forum where the \r\ninternational community has sought peace in the \r\nMiddle East, and it is the United Nations that must help \r\nthe next Government of Israel build on the foundations \r\nlaid by Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas to \r\nagree to a two-State solution that guarantees the \r\nsecurity of Israel and gives the Palestinians a viable \r\nState. \r\n In Cyprus, where the United Nations has been \r\npresent for 30 years and more, we have a real chance of \r\na settlement, thanks to new leadership, which has our \r\nsupport. \r\n In Afghanistan, the International Security \r\nAssistance Force is training Afghans to take back their \r\ncountry after two generations of almost constant \r\nconflict. When the Afghan Government can deny its \r\nland to Al-Qaida and its associates, the international \r\ncommunity will have done its job, but the task is hard \r\nand long. Progress is encouraging, but must be \r\ncontinued and stepped up. \r\n In the Sudan, United Nations peacekeepers help \r\nkeep the fragile North-South peace agreement in place, \r\nbut Darfur remains for all of us a disaster. It is the \r\nresponsibility of the Government of the Sudan to create \r\nthe conditions in Darfur that will allow the conflict to \r\nend and a new deal for the people of Darfur to be put in \r\nplace. Justice has to be part of any sustainable peace. \r\n Difficulty has never daunted the United Nations. \r\nWhere we are rebuffed, we are resolute, so we must \r\nalso send a powerful signal of our support for \r\ndemocracy and human rights in Zimbabwe. We must \r\nstand firm against oppression in Burma. We must, as \r\nwe did yesterday, reaffirm the practical measures that \r\nunderpin our determination to defeat poverty. Now \r\nwould be the worst time to turn our back on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n We have reached a unique point in the world’s \r\nhistory. For the first time in human history, we have the \r\nopportunity to come together around a global covenant, \r\nto reframe the international architecture to make it fit \r\nfor the challenges facing us in the twenty-first century, \r\nand to build the first truly global society and global \r\ncitizenship. Our history is not our destiny, it is what we \r\nchoose to make it. \r\n Let us resolve today to end any irresponsibility, \r\nto protect the global public interest by cleaning up the \r\nworld’s financial system and to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to meeting our global responsibilities on \r\ntrade, poverty, energy and climate change, and let us \r\nact upon that as people, as Governments, as nations \r\nunited. Let history record that ours was a truly global \r\nresponse to the first truly global crisis. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \r\nfor the statement he has just made.  \r\n  Mr. Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Orette Bruce \r\nGolding, Prime Minister of Jamaica \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Jamaica. \r\n  The Honourable Orette Bruce Golding, Prime \r\nMinister of Jamaica, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Orette \r\nBruce Golding, Prime Minister of Jamaica, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Golding (Jamaica): It is perhaps fortuitous \r\nthat my own Deputy Prime Minister happens to be \r\npresiding over the Assembly at the time when I address \r\nthe Assembly for the very first time. But it is not true, \r\nas someone suggested to me just before I came to the \r\nrostrum, that we have come to the sixty-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly believing that we are still at the \r\nOlympics in Beijing. Neither is it true that my name is \r\nUsain Bolt. My name is Bruce Golding.  \r\n I offer Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann my \r\ncongratulations on his presidency and I ask you, \r\nMr. Vice-President, to convey those congratulations to \r\nhim. He has assumed that office at a time when the \r\nworld faces challenges of crisis proportions. Much will \r\nbe demanded of his leadership, and I want you, Sir, to \r\nassure him of Jamaica’s full support and cooperation in \r\nall of his endeavours. \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n21 08-52272 \r\n \r\n We have convened amid worrying global \r\ndevelopments. The hopes of the new millennium are in \r\ndanger of fading as the ideals of international harmony \r\nand shared global prosperity remain elusive. \r\nGlobalization, despite its promise of expanded \r\nproduction and trade, has been uneven in the spread of \r\nits benefits and, for many countries, marginal in its \r\nimpact. Indeed, the gap between rich and poor has \r\nwidened within and among countries. \r\n The global economy now appears to be headed \r\nfor a severe downturn. Developments in the global \r\nfinancial system, the painful increase in oil and \r\ncommodity prices and the escalating food crisis \r\nthreaten to plunge vast sections of the world’s \r\npopulation deeper into poverty. Fiscal challenges and \r\nthe crippling burden of debt render many countries \r\nincapable of responding to the crisis. Countries like \r\nJamaica are called upon to respond within our limited \r\ncapacity to protect the most vulnerable. \r\n In the long term, however, our hopes for survival \r\nwill require huge investments, improved productivity, \r\nbetter access to the world’s markets and human \r\ncapacity-building. Developing countries cannot be left \r\nto find their own solutions. The situation requires a \r\ncollaborative, coordinated and global response. That is \r\nnot mere altruism. It is an indisputable truth that, if \r\ndeveloped countries assist developing countries to \r\nimprove their economies, their productive capacity and \r\nthe purchasing power of their people, they will expand \r\nthe markets for their own goods and services. It is the \r\ninterdependency that we share and that is manifested in \r\nso many other areas, from climate change to global \r\nepidemics, organized crime and human trafficking. \r\n Solving the problem of developing countries \r\nrequires more than mere liberalization of trade, more \r\nthan mere privatization of the economy and more than \r\nthe mere free flow of capital. It requires a sincere and \r\nsustained effort that focuses on the limitations that \r\nbedevil developing countries. Global development, not \r\njust global markets, must be at the centre of our \r\npriorities. \r\n Poverty and wealth should not have to coexist. \r\nPoverty can be eradicated. The tools of development \r\nexist and are capable of transforming the world, \r\nempowering the poor and enabling them to rise from \r\ntheir poverty. We must therefore commit ourselves to \r\ncreating a world in which not everyone may be rich, \r\nbut no one has to be poor. \r\n In 2001, we committed ourselves to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. We are now \r\nat the halfway mark and we are behind schedule. It is \r\ntime to take stock to see where we are, who is falling \r\nbehind, and what must be done to make up lost ground. \r\n A critical success factor must be the partnership \r\nbetween developed and developing countries as \r\ndefined in the 2002 Monterrey Consensus on financing \r\nfor development, integrating aid, debt relief, market \r\naccess, good governance and foreign direct investment. \r\nThose initiatives were carefully calibrated. Proceeding \r\nwith some elements without the others will not achieve \r\nthe goals we have set. Indeed, it might make it worse. \r\n We must all pull up our socks if we are to reverse \r\nthe slippage we have suffered. Developing countries \r\nmust ensure that their priorities are properly structured. \r\nDeveloped countries must live up to their commitment \r\nto devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to \r\nofficial development assistance. That is a modest \r\namount, yet only five countries have so far done so. \r\n The focus of development cooperation cannot, I \r\nsubmit, be too narrowly defined. The varied economic \r\nand social profiles of developing countries require a \r\nmore flexible response that recognizes investment in \r\nhuman capital, infrastructure and the transfer of \r\ntechnology as critical elements in reducing poverty in a \r\nsustained way. \r\n That is particularly important to developing \r\ncountries that are classified, based on per capita \r\nincome, as middle-income countries. That \r\nclassification deprives them of access to concessionary \r\nfinancing and creative measures to reduce the crippling \r\ndebt burden that afflicts so many of them. If we are to \r\nreduce poverty, the peculiar circumstances of those \r\ncountries cannot be ignored since that is where more \r\nthan one third of the world’s poor are to be found. \r\n We call on the international community to devise \r\nstrategic programmes to address the peculiar needs of \r\nmiddle-income countries with deep pockets of poverty. \r\nBecause of those factors and because of our exposure \r\nto frequent natural disasters, which in the matter of a \r\nfew hours can reverse gains that took years to \r\naccomplish, Jamaica and its Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) partners are proposing the international \r\nrecognition of CARICOM States as a special category \r\nof small vulnerable and highly indebted middle-income \r\ncountries. \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 22 \r\n \r\n The international financial system, designed more \r\nthan 60 years ago in the context of those times, has \r\nundergone very little change in its governance, \r\nstructure and practices. However, the world has \r\nchanged and that requires a re-engineering of the \r\nglobal financial system. Jamaica supports the call for \r\nreform of the existing financial infrastructure to reflect \r\nthe new global realities and make it more proactive and \r\nresponsive to the needs of the entire world community. \r\nI want to suggest, however, that it must involve more \r\nthan merely expanding the membership of an exclusive \r\nclub. It must be development-driven, recognizing that \r\npoverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity elsewhere. It \r\nmust include mechanisms to detect signs of global \r\ncrises and must be able to institute preventive \r\nmeasures. \r\n The crisis currently rocking the world’s financial \r\nmarkets reflects the inadequacy of the regulatory \r\nstructures that are essential to the effective functioning \r\nof any market. But it is more than that. It represents the \r\nfailure on the part of the international financial system \r\nto facilitate the flow of resources into areas where they \r\ncan produce real wealth, not paper wealth. The world is \r\nnot short of capital. What it lacks are the mechanisms \r\nto ensure the efficient utilization of that capital. \r\n I want to suggest that another urgent task is the \r\ncreation of a viable and equitable international trading \r\nsystem. Jamaica is deeply disappointed that the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round has failed to deliver on the \r\npromise of an open, fair and predictable multilateral \r\ntrading system. We urge all parties to resolve the \r\noutstanding differences, particularly on the removal of \r\ntrade-distorting agricultural subsidies, and to address \r\nthe need for special safeguard mechanisms for \r\neconomically challenged countries.  \r\n The need for more concerted action on global \r\nwarming is impatient of debate. Developing countries \r\nare the most vulnerable, but they are also the least \r\ncapable of mitigation measures. Countries that are the \r\nmajor pollutants must bear the major share of the \r\nresponsibility for corrective action. They must make \r\nbinding commitments to fulfil that responsibility. The \r\npurchase of carbon credits, especially from developing \r\ncountries, must not exculpate them from that \r\nresponsibility. \r\n Jamaica calls for a fair, equitable and balanced \r\nlong-term scheme to bind emission caps within a new \r\ninternational framework beyond 2012, when the Kyoto \r\nProtocol expires.  \r\n The impact of climate change on agricultural \r\noutput, and the frequency and intensity of natural \r\ndisasters to which countries like Jamaica are \r\nparticularly vulnerable, point to the need for a global \r\nenvironment management structure that establishes \r\nclear standards and enforces compliance. \r\n Jamaica is concerned that political instability in \r\nmany parts of the world, often fuelled by extremism \r\nand intolerance, continues to threaten regional and \r\ninternational peace and security. They are neither \r\nlimited in scope nor confined to national borders. \r\nResolving those conflicts requires effective diplomacy \r\nand global cooperation, and the United Nations must \r\ncontinue to use its good offices to secure just and \r\npeaceful settlements. \r\n Our intense focus on combating terrorism and \r\ntransnational organized crime, and eliminating nuclear \r\narms and other weapons of mass destruction must not, \r\nhowever, marginalize the need for decisive action to \r\ncurb the illicit trade in small arms, which facilitate \r\ninternal violence in many of our countries and result in \r\nhigh levels of homicide. Jamaica supports the \r\nestablishment of an arms trade treaty to impose strict \r\ncontrols on the illegal trade in small arms and \r\nammunition. \r\n The persistent humanitarian crisis in Darfur \r\ncontinues to be a matter of serious concern to all of us. \r\nWe are disappointed that the African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur is not yet fully \r\noperational. We urge all parties to desist from actions \r\nthat could deepen the crisis, jeopardize the safety of \r\nthe civilian population and of United Nations personnel \r\nand prevent access to humanitarian relief. \r\n Jamaica remains irrevocably committed to \r\nfinding a just, lasting and peaceful solution to the \r\nMiddle East conflict — a solution that must ensure the \r\nsecurity of Israel and the establishment of a viable \r\nPalestinian State. \r\n The United Nations must continue to play a \r\npivotal role through its peacekeeping missions in the \r\ncreation of sustainable peace in post-conflict situations. \r\nJamaica will use its membership in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to underscore the importance of sustained, \r\nlong-term economic development in rebuilding and \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n23 08-52272 \r\n \r\ntransforming countries that have been wracked by \r\nconflict. \r\n The devastation wrought in Haiti by recent \r\nhurricanes has aggravated the already harsh conditions \r\nunder which the Haitian people are forced to live. \r\nMuch more needs to be done not only in providing \r\nemergency relief, but also in addressing the long-term \r\nsocial, economic and development needs of that \r\ncountry, as a sustainable solution to the fragile \r\nhumanitarian situation that exists there. Haiti needs and \r\ndeserves the support of the entire international \r\ncommunity. \r\n We are gathered here this week as Members of \r\nthat union we call the United Nations. What is the state \r\nof that union? We must not ignore the cynicism that \r\nexists in some quarters about the continued value of the \r\nUnited Nations. Those cynics have not bothered to \r\ncontemplate what the world would be like if the United \r\nNations did not exist. But we have contributed to that \r\ncynicism, so often bending the facts to suit our own \r\ndesign, breaking the rules to secure a particular \r\nadvantage and making commitments without the will to \r\nhonour them. \r\n Reform of the structure and procedures of the \r\nUnited Nations is an imperative whose time has long \r\ncome. Let us not bury it in procrastination and \r\nincessant squabbling. It is time for constructive, \r\nconsensus-building dialogue. The need for changes in \r\nthe structure and scope of the Security Council has \r\nbeen under discussion for almost 15 years, bogged \r\ndown in polarized, adversarial positions. \r\n We have a compelling duty to put in place \r\nsystems that can secure peace and prosperity for the \r\nfuture. We therefore welcome the unanimous adoption \r\nof decision 62/557, contained in paragraph 23 of \r\ndocument A/62/47, which, we hope, will provide \r\nresolve for the early commencement of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations within a specified time \r\nframe and in the context of an informal plenary \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly. \r\n The sixtieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights serves to remind us of \r\nthe central role of the United Nations in promoting \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Those are \r\nessential components of the environment required for \r\nsustained development. It was consistent with that \r\nprinciple that we launched the initiative to erect a \r\nmonument to honour the victims of slavery. I thank the \r\nSecretary-General and the members of the committee \r\nfor their support and assistance. I also thank Member \r\nStates that have made or pledged contributions. We \r\ninvite other States to do likewise. \r\n Six decades ago, the founding fathers of the \r\nUnited Nations agreed that the Organization should be \r\na mechanism for harmonizing the actions of nations in \r\nthe achievement of our common goals: peace and \r\nprosperity throughout the world, respect and tolerance \r\namong the powerful and support for the weak and \r\nvulnerable. That remains our mandate, our unfinished \r\nbusiness. Fulfilling that mandate and advancing that \r\nmission will require a more proactive United Nations, \r\none that is more responsive to the needs of Member \r\nStates and gives equal attention to issues of peace, \r\nsecurity and development. The hopes of people \r\neverywhere in the world depend on us, the leadership \r\nthat we provide and the will that we exert for the times \r\nin which we live. We must not fail them. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nJamaica for the statement he has just made. \r\n  The Honourable Orette Bruce Golding, Prime \r\nMinister of Jamaica, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Lyonchoen Jigmi Yoezer \r\nThinley, Prime Minister of the Kingdom  \r\nof Bhutan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Bhutan. \r\n  Mr. Lyonchoen Jigmi Yoezer Thinley, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Bhutan, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  The President took the Chair. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Lyonchoen \r\nJigmi Yoezer Thinley, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Bhutan, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Thinley (Bhutan): As the youngest \r\ndemocracy, having become one in April of this year, \r\nmy country is honoured, and I am honoured, to have \r\nthis opportunity to present ourselves before this great \r\nworld body. In a country that has enjoyed continuous \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 24 \r\n \r\njustice, stability and progress, democracy came not by \r\nthe traditional way of struggle and violence, nor by the \r\nwill of the people. Bhutan became a democracy by the \r\npersuasion and personal efforts of a King who worked \r\nconsistently over 30 years to establish the prerequisites \r\nof a democratic culture and institutional arrangements. \r\nHaving accomplished that noble task, and having set \r\nthe polity on the final and irreversible path of \r\ndemocracy, our King abdicated the throne as a final \r\nmark of his confidence in democracy. He now lives in \r\nquiet retirement at the grand old age of 53. \r\n The King has shown that, if leaders themselves \r\nare committed to democracy, the transition can be \r\nsmooth and peaceful. Likewise, if leaders elected to \r\ngovern believe in it, democracy provides the best \r\nmeans to serve the people. That is the conviction with \r\nwhich my Government will fulfil the powerful mandate \r\nthat the people have given to us. \r\n As a representative of a country that is deeply \r\ncommitted to multilateralism and that believes firmly \r\nin the indispensability of the United Nations system, I \r\nseek the indulgence of the Assembly as I offer \r\nBhutan’s perspective from the high Himalayas of our \r\ntroubled world today. \r\n We are confronted with a host of serious \r\nchallenges that are testing the relevance of the United \r\nNations and the resolve of its Member States to work \r\ntogether. Natural disasters, food, fuel and financial \r\ncrises, deepening poverty, failing States, dwindling \r\nwater resources, diseases, human trafficking and even \r\nmaritime lawlessness afflict our society. And then there \r\nis terrorism and extremism of the most barbaric and \r\ncowardly kind, using the weak and the deranged to kill \r\nand maim the innocent. \r\n All those challenges threaten to undermine what \r\nwe have achieved collectively and as individual States. \r\nThey directly thwart our slow progress in the pursuit of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which I \r\nbelieve are among the most laudable consensual \r\nagreements achieved by this Assembly to bring about a \r\nmore just and equitable world, indeed, a more civilized \r\nworld. \r\n Bhutan does not look at those developments as \r\nseparate, disconnected events. Rather, we see them as \r\ndirectly interconnected symptoms of a larger and \r\ndeeper malaise that threatens our collective well-being \r\nand survival. Responding to each of the challenges \r\nseparately will most probably be useful in the short \r\nterm, but piecemeal efforts will not lead to permanent \r\nsolutions. We need to treat the disease beyond the \r\nsymptoms. And the disease, we believe, has to do with \r\nour way of life, which is simply not rational and \r\nsustainable. \r\n One does not need to be an economist to \r\nunderstand that the oil crisis, soaring price of metals \r\nand diminishing water reserves have to do with the fact \r\nthat for too long we have been exploiting and wasting \r\nour scarce natural resources. At the very least, these \r\ndevelopments are market reactions and attempts to \r\nreflect the true value of these resources. \r\n As for the financial crisis, it is becoming quite \r\nclear that its main cause lies in our culture of living \r\nbeyond our means, of private profiteering, of \r\nsocializing risks. Unfortunately, the possible solution \r\nseems to lie in transferring our debt to future \r\ngenerations, who are not here to argue against it. \r\n It is not difficult to see how all these crises are \r\nthe result of a way of life that is dictated by the \r\npowerful ethics of consumerism in a world of finite \r\nresources. Our life is all about fear of not having \r\nenough, about wanting more and doing better than our \r\ndear neighbour and friend. We spend and consume far \r\nbeyond our means and those of generations unborn. \r\n As we go on expanding our economies by \r\nextracting natural resources, raising productivity, \r\nincreasing consumption and discharging immeasurable \r\nvolumes of polluting waste, the climate is changing. \r\nStriking unpredictably, unseasonably and with greater \r\nfury and frequency, natural disasters such as drought, \r\ncyclones, hurricanes, floods and landslides are \r\ndestroying life, property and crops. Weather patterns \r\nhave changed and continue to change, with far more \r\nprofound implications for our civilization than we can \r\nfathom. We even wonder whether earthquakes and \r\ntsunamis may have something to do with climate \r\nchange. \r\n Yesterday, we huddled together to find solutions \r\nto the food crisis and the danger of growing hunger in a \r\nworld where already too many are starving. Diseases \r\nabound and new epidemics threaten humanity, other \r\nlife forms and crops even as medicine and technology \r\ncombine to conspire against mortality. Are these not \r\nsignals from a planet grossly abused? Could these not \r\nbe pleas to mend our ways and to search for a more \r\nsustainable way of life? \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n25 08-52272 \r\n \r\n Deepening poverty, not unlike the food crisis, is \r\nalso a sign of the disintegration of communities. As \r\ncommunities die, so does the spirit of sharing, \r\nborrowing and giving amid good neighbourliness in \r\ntimes of need, as opposed to competing and making \r\ngains at the cost of community, neighbour and even \r\none’s own family. It is about the failure of human \r\nrelationships, including between and among States. \r\nThis, I believe, lies at the root of the poverty, hunger, \r\ninstability and insecurity that plague much of the world \r\ntoday. \r\n These multiple crises bring into sharp focus the \r\nshameful inequities of our society, which fails to share \r\nand to distribute the enormous wealth it has created to \r\nsatisfy man’s insatiable greed. People suffer from \r\nhunger, thirst and exposure to the elements and die \r\nwithout treatment not because we do not have enough \r\nfood, water, clothes or medicine, but because we do not \r\nhave the will to share and the care to distribute. \r\n Only yesterday, I was wondering how many tons \r\nof food and medicine must be taken off the shelves of \r\nManhattan stores and put into the incinerator at the end \r\nof each day as they become stale or reach their date of \r\nexpiry. On the other hand, even to this day, few \r\ndeveloped countries have fulfilled their pledge to share \r\nless than 1 per cent of their gross national product \r\n(GNP) with developing countries. Likewise, the \r\npharmaceutical companies have convincing arguments \r\nto offer against lowering the cost of medicines. \r\n We need to wake up from our narcissistic slumber \r\nand self-indulgence and realize that economic well-\r\nbeing is not human well-being. We must break away \r\nfrom the shackles of the powerful forces of the market. \r\nFor that matter, could the unravelling of the market-\r\nbased economy, as evident in the financial crisis, be a \r\nglimpse of the truth that mindless and irresponsible \r\neconomic growth and expansion cannot go on? It is \r\nneither sustainable nor fair to future generations. \r\nAbove all, we could be condemning our own selves to \r\nan old age of burdensome debt and regret. \r\n That brings us to the question of whether our \r\nfundamentals are sound. Is the GDP-led growth that \r\nhas served as our measure of progress good enough for \r\nthe future? What are the foundations of our \r\ncivilizations and the values that guide us? As we get \r\nricher and live by the terms that we have set for \r\nourselves, are we truly becoming more civilized, or are \r\nwe trapped in a downward spiral of de-civilization? \r\n I ask again: does economic growth translate as \r\nhuman development? Are we mutating to become \r\nsenseless robots programmed to be materially \r\nproductive, to earn more, to want more, to consume \r\nmore and more of what we do not need and will \r\nultimately destroy us? \r\n As human beings, should we not search for and \r\nbe driven by higher values? Do we not have needs \r\nbeyond material ones, beyond that of the body alone? \r\nCan we conceptualize a holistic alternative paradigm \r\nfor meaningful and sustainable development that places \r\nthe well-being of the individual and community at the \r\ncentre and gives cause for true happiness, as opposed \r\nto fleeting pleasures? \r\n I am pleased to submit that many academic \r\ninstitutions and researchers across the world are \r\nengaged in such a search and are making progress. The \r\nlatest to join is the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development, which has hosted a \r\nseries of regional and world conferences to develop \r\nindicators to measure true human progress. \r\n My country, Bhutan, is one such entity. While \r\nbeing actively involved as a partner in the global \r\nefforts in this regard, we have pursued a unique \r\ndevelopment path, guided by our former King’s \r\nphilosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH), since \r\nthe early 1970s. GNH is based on the belief that \r\nhappiness is the single most important goal and \r\npurpose in life for every individual and that the end of \r\ndevelopment must be the promotion and enhancement \r\nof happiness. It must, therefore, we believe, be the \r\nresponsibility of the State to create an enabling \r\nenvironment within which its citizens can pursue \r\nhappiness. \r\n The concept emphasizes a balanced life, \r\nmatching the material needs of the body with the \r\nspiritual, psychological and emotional needs of the \r\nmind. To that end, the Royal Government structured its \r\ndevelopment programmes around four broad themes, or \r\npillars, that constitute a paradigm for holistic and \r\nsustainable development. These are: sustainable and \r\nequitable socio-economic development, not growth; \r\nenvironmental conservation; the promotion of culture; \r\nand good governance. Since the 1970s we have never \r\nwavered from that path, thanks greatly to the \r\ngenerosity and support of our development partners. \r\nThe former King never faltered, sacrificing his own \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 26 \r\n \r\nreign to leave the legacy of a unique democracy and a \r\ncountry that is peaceful, progressive and happy. \r\n I urge the members of the Assembly to reflect on \r\nthose and other considerations so that such crises as have \r\nnow stricken us may never reappear, so that we can return \r\neach year to this Assembly and find reasons to smile and \r\nto be happy. To that end, Mr. President, please be assured \r\nof Bhutan’s fullest support for and cooperation with you \r\nand the Secretary-General. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Bhutan for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n  Mr. Lyonchoen Jigmi Yoezer Thinley, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Bhutan, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Sergei Stanishev, Prime \r\n Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Bulgaria. \r\n  Mr. Sergei Stanishev, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Bulgaria, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Sergei \r\nStanishev, Prime Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Stanishev (Bulgaria): It is a privilege and an \r\nhonour to address this distinguished audience on behalf \r\nof Bulgaria, particularly as my country is celebrating \r\nthe centennial anniversary of the proclamation of its \r\nindependence. Throughout those 100 years, Bulgaria \r\nasserted and safeguarded its independence, often \r\nthrough active participation in international \r\norganizations, including the United Nations. Having \r\nrecently become a member of the European Union \r\n(EU), my country is now even more committed to the \r\nuniversal and regulatory role of the United Nations in \r\ntoday’s globalized world. We align ourselves with the \r\nstatement made by President Sarkozy of the French \r\nRepublic on behalf of the EU (5th meeting). \r\n Permit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session. We wish you every success in \r\nthe months ahead and pledge our full support for your \r\nendeavours. Our deep gratitude goes to His Excellency \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim for his able guidance of the \r\nAssembly at its previous session. \r\n Given the growing urgency of food security, the \r\ntopic that we are discussing today is of crucial \r\nimportance. We fully support the United Nations-led \r\nefforts, reflected in the Rome Declaration, to ensure a \r\ntimely response to a problem that may have grave \r\nconsequences for the livelihoods of millions of people. \r\n Food security is a cross-cutting issue that should \r\nbe considered against the background of other \r\ninterrelated global challenges, such as climate change \r\nand energy security. These also demand an immediate \r\nresponse based on the common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities and capabilities of various countries. \r\nThe United Nations should continue to provide a \r\nunique forum for the elaboration of the effective \r\nmultilateral approach needed. \r\n Next spring, Bulgaria intends to host a summit \r\nentitled “Gas for Europe: New Transregional \r\nPartnerships and Projects”. It is important to bring \r\ntogether heads of State and Government from all \r\ninterested countries in South-Eastern Europe, the Black \r\nSea/Caspian Sea region, Central Asia, the EU and the \r\nUnited States in order to encourage political dialogue \r\nat the highest level and to enhance transregional \r\ncooperation with a view to achieving a balance among \r\nenergy and other strategic interests. \r\n Effective multilateralism requires an intensive \r\npartnership between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations. On the basis of the European Union-United \r\nNations Joint Declaration on Cooperation in Crisis \r\nManagement, the EU and the United Nations have \r\nengaged in partnerships that have already delivered \r\nresults in many areas related to peacemaking and \r\npeacebuilding. A good and pragmatic relationship \r\nbetween the United Nations and NATO in the Western \r\nBalkans, Afghanistan and Africa is also of crucial \r\nimportance. \r\n Various forms of regional, subregional and \r\ntransborder cooperation may serve as building blocks \r\nfor a comprehensive collective security system. Peace \r\nand stability are well rooted when local communities \r\nand immediate neighbours live in harmony. That \r\nphilosophy guided the recent Bulgarian chairmanship \r\nof the South-East European Cooperation Process. \r\nRegional cooperation in South-East Europe has \r\nrecently gained momentum. South-East Europe is in \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n27 08-52272 \r\n \r\nthe process of changing from an area recovering from \r\nwar to a thriving and dynamic region. Over the past 12 \r\nmonths, a whole new architecture of interaction has \r\ncome into being, connecting the countries of the region \r\nto the rest of Europe and the international community. \r\nIn line with the concept of regional ownership, the \r\npivotal role has now been assumed by the new \r\nRegional Cooperation Council. \r\n Democracy, security and cooperation still have a \r\nway to go in the Black Sea region. More coherent \r\nefforts are needed for an ultimate settlement of the \r\nprotracted conflicts there. Frozen conflicts should not \r\nbe neglected, because they tend to reignite tension time \r\nand again. The recent armed hostilities in South \r\nOssetia and in other parts of Georgia have provided \r\nample evidence to that effect. Bulgaria gave its full \r\nsupport to the peacemaking mission of the French EU \r\npresidency and remains actively involved in the \r\npreparation of the EU Monitoring Mission. We are \r\nconvinced that the sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nof Georgia should be upheld and that the military \r\ncontingents should be withdrawn to their positions \r\nprior to the conflict in order to allow effective \r\nmonitoring by the EU and the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of the \r\nimplementation of the six-point plan. \r\n Bulgaria contributes fully to the Eastern \r\nDimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy, \r\nwhich should address the needs and priorities of all \r\npartners in the region. We see opportunities for \r\nlaunching projects in important sectors such as \r\ntransport, trade, energy, the environment and border \r\nsecurity. The EU’s Black Sea Synergy initiative is a \r\npragmatic way to intertwine various regional \r\ninitiatives, thus multiplying their effect. \r\n As prevention and development are inextricably \r\nlinked, the Bulgarian Government and the country \r\noffice of the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) in Bulgaria are currently exploring the \r\npotential for a Bulgaria/UNDP regional hub for the \r\nWestern Balkans and the Black Sea area to share \r\naccumulated know-how, training and research. \r\n We condemn terrorism unequivocally and reject \r\nterrorist ideology in all its forms and manifestations. \r\nThe first review of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy held recently proved that the United \r\nNations should continue to play a central role in \r\nmobilizing the international community to counter \r\nterrorism and all related phenomena, such as \r\nradicalization and extremism. \r\n In countering terrorism, it is essential to conduct \r\nthat struggle within the requirements of international \r\nlaw and to overcome prejudices and stereotype \r\nperceptions in a world of great diversity. Bulgaria’s \r\nlong history of tolerance has been based on the \r\ncommon understanding that cultural diversity is a great \r\nasset in our society. It is in that spirit that Bulgaria \r\nactively participates in the United Nations Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and supports other like-minded \r\ninitiatives. \r\n This year, we mark the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. As we pay \r\ntribute to the six decades of promoting peace and \r\nprotecting the vulnerable, we should also realize that \r\nthere is still much to be done. The United Nations is \r\nfacing a serious challenge due to the complex and \r\nmultidimensional character of a growing number of \r\npeace operations and missions. \r\n Bulgaria continues to make its contribution to the \r\ninternational peacekeeping efforts in the western \r\nBalkans, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Our task today \r\nis not only to keep the peace; we must also make \r\ncertain that peace is irreversible and sustainable. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, an early achievement of \r\nthe reform process, has now become functional and has \r\nachieved some practical results in Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone. \r\n Global celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year \r\nhave reaffirmed the critical importance of universal \r\nadherence to international human rights standards, the \r\nrealization of which should make the world better for \r\nus all, free of poverty, intolerance and discrimination. \r\nDespite the progress achieved, we should never relent \r\nin our efforts. The Human Rights Council, with its \r\ninstitution-building process successfully accomplished, \r\nshould engage in constructive, all-inclusive work \r\naimed at promoting and guaranteeing all human rights \r\nfor all. \r\n Stable peace and security can be achieved only \r\nthrough development. Therefore, there is an urgent \r\nneed to accelerate the implementation of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We are convinced \r\nthat the responsibility for the timely achievement of \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 28 \r\n \r\nthose Goals lies with both developed and developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Solidarity with those in need, and in particular \r\nwith the developing countries, is an important and \r\nirrevocable principle of Bulgarian foreign policy. We \r\nare taking our first steps in building a new donor \r\ncapacity and shall strive to achieve the targeted levels \r\nof official development assistance as part of the \r\nEuropean Union development cooperation policy. \r\n In order to perform its role in the world \r\nefficiently, the United Nations must follow persistently \r\nthe course of reforms initiated at the 2005 World \r\nSummit. We welcome the progress achieved during the \r\nsixty-second session of the General Assembly towards \r\nimproving the working modalities of the main United \r\nNations bodies. Bulgaria expects that the remaining \r\ntasks on the United Nations reform agenda will be \r\npursued vigorously and without delay during the \r\ncurrent session. \r\n In that regard, we welcome the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General and his determination expressed in \r\nhis opening statement. It is in our common interest to \r\nensure that this sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly achieve tangible results. That is what the \r\npeoples of our countries, the people of the world, are \r\nexpecting of us. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Bulgaria for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n  Mr. Sergei Stanishev, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Bulgaria, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Tuilaepa \r\nLupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nof the Independent State of Samoa  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa. \r\n  The Honourable Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele \r\nMalielegaoi, Prime Minister of the Independent \r\nState of Samoa, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Tuilaepa \r\nLupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): The United Nations \r\nembodies multilateralism. It is living testimony of the \r\nintergovernmental process at work. Samoa’s \r\nmembership of the United Nations is grounded on the \r\npromise of the hope, equality and justice the United \r\nNations offers the Member States, irrespective of their \r\neconomic, political or military strengths. Looking \r\nback, our Organization has not lived up to the lofty \r\ngoals enshrined in its Charter. Its credibility has been \r\ntarnished and undermined, and its performance \r\nquestioned at times. \r\n Yet, those perceived failings of our Organization \r\nare of our own making when we allow the vested \r\ninterests of a few to take precedence over the urgent \r\nand deserving needs of the majority; when we accept \r\nflawed perceptions that certain issues, States and \r\nregions are more important than others, distorting the \r\nworld’s focus and the allocation of resources; when we \r\nturn a blind eye and let the numerical superiority of \r\ngroups or the importance of some stakeholders \r\nfrustrate informed discussions of critical issues to score \r\npoints and achieve symbolic wins that help no one in \r\nthe long run; and when the long list of broken promises \r\nand unfulfilled undertakings couched in eloquent yet \r\nmeaningless rhetoric creates frustration and mistrust \r\namong Member States. \r\n The end result is that if no one takes \r\nresponsibility, the future of the United Nations will be \r\nin doubt and the cost to the world incalculable. We \r\nhave no one but ourselves to blame for any deficit in \r\nthe credibility of our Organization. What we urgently \r\nneed is a collective sense of trust and commitment to \r\nits Charter. Only then will the United Nations remain \r\nrelevant and regain the confidence of our Members. \r\n There is too much at stake for the world to just sit \r\nidly by. Strong global leadership is at a premium. \r\nGovernments must yield not to vested interests and \r\nexpediency, but because it is the ethical and the just \r\nthing to do. \r\n That was my message from this rostrum last year, \r\nand I am happy to restate it again today. No Member \r\nState is too powerful or too small not to be part of the \r\nsolution of making the United Nations an agent of \r\nchange and a beacon of hope during these challenging \r\ntimes. And no contribution is too trivial or unimportant \r\nnot to matter. For States in leadership positions, the \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n29 08-52272 \r\n \r\nideal is to lead with humility, fairness and a kind heart. \r\nThe world expects nothing less. Leadership and \r\nresponsibility are, after all, one and the same. \r\n Clearly, Member States can only do so much. We \r\nneed a committed Secretariat that is aware of and \r\nsensitive to the needs of the people it serves. That is a \r\nnon-negotiable prerequisite. Samoa supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s vision of creating a professional \r\ncareer service that is flexible and mobile enough to \r\nallow for quick and positive responses to the diverse \r\ndemands of Member States. The need for the United \r\nNations to deliver as one entity cannot be \r\noveremphasized. It adds value and quality to the \r\nprocess, eliminates waste, minimizes overlaps and \r\nensures that the scarce resources entrusted to its care \r\nare used optimally to supplement Members States’ \r\nhard-earned efforts. \r\n Right now our world is facing a difficult and \r\ntroubled time. As members of the global community, \r\nour futures are inextricably linked. For Samoa, the \r\nsmall size of our country, its isolation from the major \r\nmarkets and permanent vulnerability to climate change \r\nare factors beyond our control. Yet even as a least \r\ndeveloped small island nation that has made little or no \r\ncontribution to the causes of today’s crises, Samoa is \r\nnot shielded from their immediate negative impact and \r\nlong-term consequences. \r\n Global crises, as we know from bitter experience \r\nwith global warming, energy and food prices, and now \r\nwith the mayhem in financial markets that threatens to \r\nengulf the world, affect all our nations irrespective of \r\nwhether we contributed to those crises or not. \r\n This is why, in spite of shortcomings in the \r\nOrganization, the United Nations remains the only \r\nviable institution that draws all the nations of our \r\nworld together. However, the need to revitalize the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to reform the Security Council \r\nhas been obvious for many years. In the case of the \r\nSecurity Council, as long as its current composition \r\nand rules ignore today’s realities, it will continue to \r\nstruggle to effectively carry out its intended tasks, as \r\nwe have seen it do over many years.  \r\n Samoa remains firm in its position that the \r\npermanent and non-permanent membership categories \r\nof the Security Council should be expanded. Member \r\nStates with legitimate credentials should be encouraged to \r\nstake their claims. Importantly, the intergovernmental \r\nprocess should commence in earnest during the current \r\nsession to bring finality to an issue that has taxed \r\nMembers States’ patience and endurance for over a \r\ndecade and a half. \r\n At the very minimum, the unanimous support of \r\nthe current permanent members of the Security Council \r\nis a must. We hope, therefore, that candidate States and \r\npermanent members will reach out to each other in \r\ngood faith and set aside the barriers that continue to \r\nfrustrate the reforms to the Security Council that we all \r\nknow must be made. \r\n One observation that has been made over many \r\nyears is that there seems to be indifference, whether \r\nintended or not, on the part of some of the leader \r\nnations of our Organization towards small and \r\neconomically weak States, which, while they observe \r\ngood governance and practice sound economic \r\nmanagement, are nevertheless faced with the constant \r\nstruggle to sustain and maintain the hard-won gains on \r\nthose fronts. \r\n Paradoxically, the only time those struggling \r\nStates get noticed is when they are tottering on the \r\nbrink or in the process of becoming failed States. By \r\nthen, the cost in salvage action and remedial \r\nprogrammes is enormous. Therefore, the willingness of \r\nleader nations to listen and to try and understand early \r\non the problems of States struggling to sustain good \r\ngovernance and economic management would go a \r\nlong way towards creating effective partnerships, \r\ndeploying scarce resources efficiently, and engendering \r\ngoodwill and trust in the process. \r\n Troubled spots around the world are on the rise, \r\nincluding in our own Pacific region. Some are \r\noccasioned by outside forces and influences, and others \r\nthrough domestically induced factors. Notwithstanding \r\nour differences, we all aspire to the same values in life. \r\nHence, we must heed the lessons of history and provide \r\nappropriate encouragement and interventions to help \r\nStates restore good governance and abide by the \r\nprinciples of democracy. \r\n Yesterday’s high-level meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) was a timely \r\nreminder, not of what we have achieved by the midway \r\npoint, but what decisive actions must be taken urgently \r\nif the time-bound targets set at the dawn of the new \r\nmillennium are to be met. Samoa participated in the \r\nrecent Accra meeting on aid effectiveness, which \r\nfurther refined the pathways to the MDGs review just \r\nconcluded and the International Conference on \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 30 \r\n \r\nFinancing for Development in Doha in November \r\n2008. \r\n Our strategic plan for 2008 to 2012 is a \r\ncomprehensive development framework linked to the \r\nbudget process for the implementation of the MDGs, \r\nwith strategic targeting of those goals on which we \r\nhave seen minimal progress through priority resource \r\nallocation. \r\n We are grateful to the Governments of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China and the United Kingdom \r\nfor their support through debt relief. Similarly, we want \r\nto acknowledge the innovative partnerships in which \r\nwe are engaged with our development partners, both \r\nold and new, giving us full ownership of the process in \r\nour quest to achieve as many of the MDGs as we \r\npossibly can. \r\n In September 2007, during the 2007 South Pacific \r\nGames in Samoa, my Government worked closely with \r\nthe United Nations system and others to promote the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. One innovative way of \r\nusing sports as a vehicle to effect change in behaviour \r\nand to relay development messages was the installation \r\nof a solar-powered “MDG scoreboard” in front of a \r\nGovernment building to monitor national progress \r\ntowards the MDGs. \r\n Climate change continues to play a pivotal role in \r\nthe decisions of the leaders in our region. Our Pacific \r\nIslands Forum meeting in August 2008 adopted the \r\nNiue Declaration on Climate Change. Our Forum \r\ncommuniqué, issued at the same summit, highlighted \r\nthe vulnerability of Pacific small island developing \r\nStates to the impacts of climate change. The European \r\nUnion and the Pacific Islands Forum Troika agreed last \r\nweek to work together to highlight the ongoing \r\nvulnerability of Pacific islands to the impacts of sea-\r\nlevel rise. Our representatives to the United Nations \r\nare working with like-minded countries to bring to the \r\nfore the security implications of climate change. \r\n In total, those efforts and partnerships should \r\nconvince those in denial that climate change is real. Its \r\neffects have already been felt by some of our Pacific \r\nisland States, and for some low-lying islands climate \r\nchange is an existential issue and their long-term \r\nsurvivability is at stake. \r\n Only through selfless and concerted efforts by all \r\ncountries, led by the major greenhouse gas emitters, \r\ncan we have a fighting chance of lessening the \r\ndestructive impact of climate change and enhancing the \r\nchances of a credible post-Kyoto agreement beyond \r\n2012. To reach that goal, the Bali Road Map — with its \r\nfour pillars of adaptation, mitigation, finance and \r\ntechnology — should be supported both in word and in \r\ndeed. \r\n The unpredictable weather patterns of recent \r\ntimes, affecting all regions of the world, are a sober \r\nreminder of our limitations as human beings against \r\nthe force of natural elements no matter how good and \r\ntechnologically sound our preparations are. We need a \r\nglobal response if we are to succeed. Samoa was \r\npleased, therefore, to see Australia take its place as a \r\nState party to the Kyoto Protocol at the Bali meeting. \r\nWe remain optimistic that, either through a change of \r\nheart or through new circumstances, other countries \r\nwill join the Kyoto Protocol to strengthen the \r\nimplementation regimes of the Convention. \r\n I mentioned last year the offer of the United \r\nNations system to establish an inter-agency climate \r\nchange centre in our country for coordinated support to \r\nPacific island countries and regional organizations for \r\nclimate change mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk \r\nreduction. Given the clear importance to the Pacific \r\nregion of the project, Samoa has allocated land — 16 \r\nacres in all — on which to locate the centre and awaits \r\nthe provision of the necessary resources by the United \r\nNations so that the facility, which is already public \r\nknowledge in the region, can be constructed. \r\n Samoa continues to support United Nations \r\npeacekeeping efforts worldwide. Small as we are, \r\nSamoan police continue to serve side by side with \r\nofficers from other countries in Liberia, the Sudan and \r\nTimor-Leste as part of our ongoing commitment. \r\nWithin the Pacific region, our solidarity in confronting \r\nthe challenges facing our neighbours ensures a \r\nguaranteed Samoan police presence in the Regional \r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands under the \r\numbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum. \r\n A durable peace settlement in the Middle East \r\ncontinues to elude us, but that does not constitute \r\ngrounds to be pessimistic. We should support every \r\neffort to create conditions conducive to the creation of \r\nan independent Palestinian State alongside a secure and \r\nsafe State of Israel. \r\n Finally, those bent on creating fear and panic \r\nthroughout the world will stop at nothing to achieve \r\ntheir aims. We must not be held hostage to their \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n31 08-52272 \r\n \r\ndevious designs. Individually and collectively, we must \r\nstep up our efforts to combat the threat of international \r\nterrorism in its many manifestations. No country can \r\nsucceed on its own. Only by working collaboratively \r\ncan we be successful. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Independent State of Samoa for the \r\nstatement he has just made.  \r\n  Mr. Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, \r\nPrime Minister of the Independent State of Samoa, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Right Honourable Hubert \r\nAlexander Ingraham, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Finance of the Commonwealth of \r\nthe Bahamas \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Finance of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas. \r\n  The Right Honourable Hubert Alexander \r\nIngraham, Prime Minister and Minister of \r\nFinance of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency The Right \r\nHonourable Hubert Alexander Ingraham, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Finance of the \r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Ingraham (Bahamas): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas, I congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption \r\nof the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession, and I assure you of the full support and \r\ncooperation of my delegation. I should also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to commend Mr. Kerim on his \r\nstewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession, which has just concluded. \r\n The Bahamas commends the Secretary-General \r\nfor this opportunity to assess our global commitment. \r\nWe first committed ourselves to the creation of a \r\nsociety for all in 1995. Five years later, we \r\nrecommitted ourselves to that objective and signed on \r\nto the development agenda, a noble objective. We are \r\nnow at the halfway point, and we must judge for \r\nourselves whether the progress made has been good \r\nenough. We believe that efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \r\nultimately create a society for all must be carried out in \r\ntandem with steps to achieve full employment and \r\ndecent work for all. \r\n The implementation of the MDGs is simply the \r\nimplementation of my Government’s philosophy and \r\nprogrammes. It is with considerable satisfaction, \r\ntherefore, that I am able to report that the Bahamas has \r\nachieved many of the MDG targets and indicators. \r\nOver a two-year period, assistance to the poor in the \r\nBahamas and to low-income families is being increased \r\nby 45 per cent. \r\n The issue of international migration and \r\ndevelopment is of particular concern to the Bahamas. \r\nWe have been burdened for some 60 years now with \r\nirregular and unauthorized migration, which places \r\nincreased demands upon the education, health and \r\nsocial services of the Bahamas. It also represents \r\npotential national security threats, particularly as \r\norganized crime networks have become increasingly \r\ninvolved in the cross-border smuggling of illicit drugs, \r\nfirearms and human cargoes. Therefore, the Bahamas \r\nlooks forward to the discussion scheduled to take place \r\nduring this session on the follow-up to the 2006 High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment. \r\n New and emerging problems continue to slow \r\nglobal development, and the current food, energy and \r\nfinancial crises threaten to erode the gains made over \r\nthe past 10 years towards ending poverty, hunger and \r\nmalnutrition and reducing deaths. Apart from the \r\nconsequential increase in production costs for all \r\nconsumer goods, the growing cost of energy is \r\naffecting the travel plans of many, with direct negative \r\nconsequences for tourism, the primary industry of the \r\nBahamas. \r\n Of equal concern is the persistent challenge of \r\nclimate change, especially for small island developing \r\nStates such as the Bahamas, where 80 per cent of our \r\nlandmass is within 1.5 metres of sea level. It is no \r\nsurprise to find the Bahamas listed among the 100 \r\ncountries most vulnerable to the consequences of \r\nclimate change and sea-level rise. Potential impacts of \r\nfurther rises in temperature include not only the \r\nenvironmental degradation of marine and terrestrial \r\necosystems — loss of biodiversity and compromised \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 32 \r\n \r\ngroundwater tables, agricultural lands and fishery \r\nresources — but also the social and economic losses \r\nthat might be expected from labour displacement.  \r\n My Government has recorded its commitment to \r\npreserve our marine and terrestrial environments and to \r\nmeet the targets established by the United Nations \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity for 2010 and 2012. \r\nIndeed, we fully expect to exceed our commitment to \r\nconserve at least 20 per cent of the near-shore marine \r\nresources across the Bahamas by 2020. That reality \r\ninforms the Bahamas’ desire for urgent action on \r\nclimate change.  \r\n The increasing number and fury of tropical \r\nstorms and hurricanes passing through the Caribbean \r\nare, I believe, yet another indication of the negative \r\neffects of global climate change. This year alone, those \r\ntropical storms and hurricanes have had a devastating \r\neffect on a number of countries in our subregion, \r\nincluding the island of Inagua in the southern \r\nBahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the \r\nTurks and Caicos Islands and Haiti. They pose a \r\nsingularly peculiar threat to our countries, as they are \r\ncapable, literally in one fell swoop, of wiping out all \r\nthe development gains we have achieved over many \r\nyears of hard work.  \r\n That is especially true for Haiti, where conditions \r\nare especially grim. The Bahamas is pleased that the \r\nUnited Nations has remained actively engaged in Haiti. \r\nThe Bahamas commends the work of the United \r\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. As the current \r\nChair of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response \r\nAgency, I am pleased that the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) has been able to contribute to the relief \r\nefforts in Haiti, but Haiti’s needs remain at proportions \r\nthat can be addressed only by the international \r\ncommunity. We are heartened by the flash appeal for \r\nHaiti under the auspices of the United Nations Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \r\n The current global economic climate presents a \r\nformidable challenge to both developed and developing \r\ncountries. The Bahamas has established a comparative \r\nand competitive advantage in a number of international \r\nservice industries by laying a solid foundation based \r\nupon the rule of law, with its attendant protection of \r\nprivate property rights, combined with sound \r\nmacroeconomic policies and a commitment to \r\ndemocratic ideals that foster an enduring political \r\nstability. \r\n Our participation in the international economic, \r\nfinancial and trading systems has permitted us to \r\nembrace opportunities presented by globalization and \r\nto achieve reasonable levels of growth and \r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, we remain vulnerable to \r\nthe challenges posed by our size and the limits on our \r\nrepresentation in global governance. \r\n The Bahamas supports the strengthening of the \r\nUnited Nations Committee of Experts on International \r\nCooperation in Tax Matters and its upgrade to an \r\nintergovernmental body. It is the view of the Bahamas \r\nthat international tax matters, including issues of \r\nimportance to developing countries that are not \r\nadequately addressed in other organizations, should be \r\ndiscussed in an open, transparent and inclusive forum. \r\nFor that and other important reasons the Bahamas calls \r\nfor the convening of a major international conference \r\nto review the international financial and monetary \r\narchitecture and global economic governance \r\nstructures. The case of small developing countries must \r\nbe addressed in the context of international systems \r\nthat are fair, equitable, objective, open and inclusive. \r\nTherefore, effective permanent representation of \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly small developing \r\ncountries, is needed in the international economic, \r\ntrade and financial institutions, including the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization, \r\nas well as other bodies, such as the Financial Stability \r\nForum. \r\n The Bahamas reaffirms its support for the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform with a view to expanding the membership of \r\nthat body in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories, as well as improving its working methods. \r\nInternational peace and security is important to us all. \r\nThe Bahamas fully supported the General Assembly’s \r\nadoption of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy in September 2006 as a framework \r\nfor collective action to prevent and combat terrorism. \r\n The Bahamas condemns terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations, and we call for, and commit to, the \r\nfull implementation of a culture of peace, justice and \r\nhuman development and respect for all religions and \r\ncultures. I am pleased to report my Government’s \r\nratification, since taking office last year, of the United \r\nNations Convention against Corruption, the \r\nInternational Convention on the Suppression of \r\nTerrorist Bombings and the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime — the Palermo \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n33 08-52272 \r\n \r\nConvention — and its Protocols. The Bahamas \r\ncommends the Secretary-General’s initiative in \r\norganizing the first-ever United Nations Symposium on \r\nSupporting Victims of Terrorism. \r\n Escalating acts of crime and violence, civil \r\nunrest, wars and internal conflicts around the world \r\ncontinue to threaten our efforts to create a just and \r\npeaceful international environment. The 2008 World \r\nDrug Report indicates that the supply of illicit drugs is \r\nincreasing. That has serious consequences for our \r\nsubregion. The Bahamas and members of CARICOM \r\nare neither significant producers nor suppliers of \r\nnarcotics. We are neither manufacturers nor suppliers \r\nof small arms and light weapons. Yet the meteoric rise \r\nin the illicit trafficking in drugs, small arms and light \r\nweapons, illegal migration and human trafficking \r\nthrough our subregion creates a formidable challenge \r\nto the national security and socio-economic growth and \r\ndevelopment of our countries. Therefore, the Bahamas \r\nreiterates the call made by CARICOM last July for the \r\nillicit brokering in small arms and light weapons to be \r\naddressed in a holistic, transparent and legally binding \r\nmanner, with renewed commitments for effective and \r\nenhanced safeguards. \r\n We are poised to mark, on 10 December, one of \r\nthe greatest achievements of this great Organization: \r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. The Bahamas \r\nreaffirms its commitment to the fundamental principles \r\nof human rights, dignity and freedom for all. The \r\nBahamas commends the entering into force of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \r\nand the adoption of the International Convention for \r\nthe Protection of All Persons from Enforced \r\nDisappearances and the United Nations Declaration on \r\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \r\n For more than six decades, human rights, poverty \r\nand development and peace and security have attracted \r\nthe attention of this Assembly. The complexity of those \r\nissues, coupled with a lack of good governance and \r\npolitical sensitivity, has too often impeded meaningful \r\nadvances. As we celebrate the Declaration’s sixtieth \r\nanniversary, I recall the vision of a former First Lady \r\nof the United States of America, Eleanor Roosevelt, as \r\nexpressed in her address on 8 March 1960: \r\n “We are going to have to work for a peaceful \r\nworld continuously, without stopping because \r\ndifferences exist among people. They exist in \r\nfamilies, they exist within nations and they will \r\nexist in the world. And therefore, without any \r\nquestion you are going to have to work to achieve \r\npeace in the world much more continuously than \r\nyou have ever worked.” \r\nThat is as true today as it was 48 years ago. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  The Right Honourable Hubert Alexander \r\nIngraham, Prime Minister and Minister of \r\nFinance of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by His Excellency Mr. Ralph E. \r\nGonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines. \r\n  His Excellency Mr. Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Ralph E. \r\nGonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines): At the outset, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines expresses its solidarity with the people of \r\nCuba, Haiti, Jamaica and the United States of America, \r\nwho have been savagely battered in quick succession \r\nby Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna and Ike. Within the \r\nCaribbean and our America, the heroism, bravery and \r\nresilience of the Cuban, Haitian and Jamaican people \r\nand ordinary Americans are a well-documented source \r\nof pride to us all. We wish you all, the afflicted nations \r\nand peoples, a speedy recovery, and we stand with you \r\nin your rebuilding efforts. \r\n Allow me to express my pleasure in noting that \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly is now held by \r\na man whose native shores are kissed by the \r\nmagnificent Caribbean Sea. I am comforted by the \r\nknowledge that he has a full appreciation of the \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 34 \r\n \r\nmajesty of our landscape and seascape, the \r\nopportunities and challenges facing our region, and the \r\nnobility of our Caribbean civilization. Mr. President, \r\nyour dream that another world is possible, as \r\ncourageously outlined in your inaugural presidential \r\nstatement, is both timely and prescient. I \r\nwholeheartedly endorse your call for frankness, \r\ndemocratization and a focus on the needs of the poor, \r\nall under the redemptive and transformative rubric of \r\nlove and solidarity with our fellow human beings. \r\n It is in that spirit of love and frankness that I \r\ncome before the Assembly today. In all candour, I must \r\naffirm what you, Mr. President, have already \r\nconcluded: that the United Nations, as the supreme \r\nmultilateral institution of a profoundly troubled and \r\niniquitous world, can and must do more, in the form of \r\ndecisive action, to improve the condition of our planet, \r\nthe living conditions of the less fortunate and the safety \r\nof our global family. \r\n The late Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia once \r\nstated: \r\n “Throughout history, it has been the inaction of \r\nthose who could have acted, the indifference of \r\nthose who should have known better, the silence \r\nof the voice of justice when it mattered most that \r\nhas made it possible for evil to triumph.” \r\n There can be no doubt that the right-thinking and \r\ncivilized peoples of the world are aware of the \r\nchallenges facing us and of the path to peace, \r\nprosperity, and progress upon which we must \r\ncollectively embark. However, the work that we have \r\nentrusted to the United Nations is compromised by \r\napathy and inaction by too many of us and by the \r\ncrippling pursuit of narrow self-interest by a handful of \r\npowerful countries. In this session, we have an historic \r\nopportunity to reassert the relevance and credibility of \r\nthis body by keeping the promises that we have made \r\nto ourselves and the world. \r\n The United Nations is charged with tackling the \r\nweighty problems that beset the world, not with the \r\nrefinement of the art of impotent diplomacy. I have no \r\ndoubt that the principles concealed in the language of \r\n“mandate review”, “system-wide coherence” and \r\n“revitalization” are important, and doubly so to the \r\nprofessional diplomats who look inward rather than \r\noutward and who lose sight of the forest for the trees in \r\ntheir endless quest to choreograph the dancing of ever \r\nmore angels on the head of a pin.  \r\n One year ago, I stood at this very podium and \r\ndenounced the failure of the international community \r\nto end the genocide in Darfur. One year ago, there were \r\npromising, though belated, signs that the United \r\nNations was finally beginning to act decisively in this \r\nregard. One year ago, I stated that “the force on the \r\nground is still insufficient, its mandate is ambiguous \r\nand its emerging presence is years too late” \r\n(A/62/PV.10, p. 15). Today, one year later, I am \r\nshocked by our collective failures in Darfur. Last \r\nmonth, Force Commander Martin Luther Agwai \r\ncompared his role to that of a boxer in the ring with his \r\nhands tied behind his back, because his promised force \r\nof 26,000 personnel is still less than 10,000 strong.  \r\n I thus reflect as to whether our promises of \r\n“never again” and our commitments to the memories of \r\none million Rwandans mean anything, as the blood of \r\nhundreds of thousands of Africans again stains the soil \r\nof the continent and our collective conscience. As a \r\npeople whose past and future are inextricably \r\ninterwoven with the continent, we, the citizens of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, ask ourselves, in the \r\nwords of the Caribbean Nobel Laureate from Saint \r\nLucia, Derek Walcott, “How can I face such slaughter \r\nand be cool?! How can I turn from Africa and live?” \r\nThe conflict in Darfur is over five years old, and the \r\ntime has long since past for genuine international \r\naction to halt that unspeakable human tragedy. \r\n While I congratulate the General Assembly on \r\nfinally clearing the way towards intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform, it cannot be \r\nan illusory or insincere process. The credibility of the \r\ndecisions made by the United Nations in the name of \r\npeace and security hinges on the existence of a \r\nSecurity Council that is democratic and representative \r\nof the regional and development diversity of our body. \r\n As we are all well aware, the scarcities and \r\nescalating prices of basic foodstuffs have already led to \r\nriots and political instability worldwide and within our \r\nown Caribbean Community. While Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines has confronted the crisis with a creative \r\nnational food production plan that mixes agricultural \r\nincentives with education and assistance, our local \r\nmeasures are only ameliorative and cannot totally \r\ninsulate us from what is largely an imported problem.  \r\n We are again buffeted by the winds of unequal \r\ntrade liberalization, in which the agricultural subsidies \r\nof developed States force our own nascent \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n35 08-52272 \r\n \r\nagro-industries into an uncompetitive demise. We are \r\nwitness to a world where crops are grown to feed cars \r\nwhile people starve, and where climate change ruins \r\nage-old farming and fishing livelihoods. The so-called \r\nfood crisis that we now face is but a symptom of \r\ndeeper structural flaws in our global economic system \r\nand consumerist culture. It represents the human face \r\nat the confluence of countless systemic flaws and \r\npoorly conceived strategies, including trade barriers, \r\nthe mad rush to biofuels, adverse climate changes and \r\nanaemic development assistance. Any meaningful \r\nattempt to alleviate the suffering of the poor and \r\nhungry people of the world must start with those \r\nsystemic issues and resist the urge to treat the \r\nsymptoms while ignoring the disease and its causes. \r\n The banana farmers of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines continue their heroic struggles to eke out a \r\nliving in the face of international corporate greed, \r\nthinly disguised as principled globalization. Our \r\nfarmers, tradesmen and private sector are still waiting \r\nfor the oft-promised opportunities that supposedly \r\naccompany globalization. However, the evidence to \r\ndate suggests that the international community has \r\ninadvertently institutionalized and entrenched poverty \r\nwithin a system of global winners and losers. The \r\nironically titled Doha Development Round looks less \r\nand less like a negotiating process and more and more \r\nlike a suicide pact within which the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) and the major economic Powers \r\nwant everything and concede little or nothing to the \r\npoor and developing nations of the world.  \r\n The solutions to our economic crises hinge upon \r\ngenuine negotiation and compromise in the interests of \r\nthe world’s least privileged. We are ill-served by \r\nbenign neglect, unequal enforcement and concepts of \r\nwelfare colonialism. The recent troubles in the world’s \r\npremier financial and banking countries exacerbate the \r\nprofound challenges facing developing nations. \r\n Six years ago, world leaders gathered in Mexico \r\nand gave birth to the Monterrey Consensus, in which \r\nthey pledged their objective to eradicate poverty, \r\nachieve sustained economic growth and promote \r\nsustainable development as we advance to a fully \r\ninclusive and equitable global economic system. I \r\nprayed at the time that the Conference would not \r\ndevolve into a dragon’s dance upon a decorous \r\nplatform of the finest diplomatic language which few \r\nare determined to embrace for action.  \r\n Six years later, Monterrey is remembered as the \r\nsite of grand, unfulfilled commitments to the \r\ndeveloping world, much as Africa recalls the empty \r\npromises of Gleneagles. The four decade-old promise \r\nto devote 0.7 per cent of gross national income to \r\nofficial development assistance remains more illusion \r\nthan reality. Countries like ours are therefore forced to \r\nscour the globe for friends willing to partner with us \r\nfor the development of our people, while others would \r\nrather sit in judgement of our development decisions \r\nand priorities than rise to offer a helping hand.  \r\n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines once again \r\npleads with the international community to be \r\ncognizant of the plight of Taiwan’s 23 million people. \r\nEven though the United Nations historical neglect of \r\nthe Taiwan issue has not been a source of pride, the \r\nGovernment of Taiwan has acted responsibly and \r\nwithout confrontation to subordinate many of its \r\nlegitimate political claims into efforts aimed at \r\nreducing cross-Strait tensions, promoting peace and \r\nbuilding relations with the People’s Republic of China.  \r\n The United Nations must now act to ensure the \r\nsurvival of that fledgling rapprochement. Taiwan \r\nshould be encouraged on its path to peace by \r\npermitting its meaningful participation in the \r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. Much as \r\nTaiwan’s vibrant economy is recognized through its \r\nparticipation in WTO, there is no compelling reason \r\nwhy its equally vibrant people should be denied \r\nparticipation in the World Health Organization and \r\nother specialized agencies. \r\n The Caribbean is in the midst of its annual \r\nhurricane season and the awesome winds, sea surges \r\nand torrential rains of Gustav, Hanna and Ike have \r\nbrought the issue of climate change into sharp relief. It \r\nis a matter of life and death to the people of the \r\nCaribbean and other small island developing States. \r\nSimilarly, the cost of adaptation to the changes \r\nwrought by our industrialized brothers and sisters must \r\nbe borne adequately and responsibly by those who \r\nhave so profoundly altered our global environment.  \r\n Hurricanes remind us in the Caribbean of our \r\nexistential oneness. Accordingly, the effort of \r\nCaribbean nations to fashion a more perfect union is to \r\nbe fully supported as a vital strategic necessity. \r\n The geographic happenstance that has placed the \r\ninnocent people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in \r\nthe path of increasingly intense storms has also located \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 36 \r\n \r\nus unfortunately between the supply and demand that \r\nfuel much of the West’s narcotics trade. As a result, our \r\nscarce resources are increasingly being diverted to \r\nstem the tide of drugs and small arms flowing through \r\nour region.  \r\n To the people of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, disarmament means not the eradication of \r\nnuclear weapons, which we lack the will and resources \r\nto build, but the elimination of small arms, which \r\nthreaten to shoot holes in the fabric of our democracy \r\nand compromise the values of our civilization. We are \r\nassailed by guns, which we do not build, and by deadly \r\nnarcotics such as cocaine, which we do not produce. \r\nThe United Nations must act to protect the innocent \r\nvictims of the world from the scourge of small arms \r\nand light weapons. \r\n In recent months, I have been profoundly \r\ntroubled by the creeping return of cold war rhetoric to \r\nthe language of international and hemispheric \r\ndiscourse. In this globalized and interconnected world, \r\nit is no longer possible to divide the planet into \r\ncompeting hemispheres or to completely quarantine or \r\nindeed blockade ideological foe from friend. We must \r\nguard against the return of discarded philosophies and \r\nlearn from the recent past, in which developing \r\ncountries were used as pawns and proxies for the \r\nhegemonic ambitions of others.  \r\n Our multipolar experiment is too young for the \r\ndeveloping and globalizing world to return to the old \r\nrhetoric and recriminations that invariably blossom \r\ninto violence and death, most often visited on the \r\npeoples of developing countries. It is my sincere prayer \r\nthat this body will hew more closely to the principles \r\nof multilateralism and the sovereign equality of all \r\nStates, and resist any pressures for the United Nations \r\nto devolve into a playground for the triumphalist \r\nambitions of presumptive super-Powers. \r\n Mr. President, you sit at the helm of a body \r\nentrusted with the well-being and safekeeping of \r\nhumanity. We have gradually strayed from the noblest \r\nof our goals and increasingly paid only lip service to \r\nproblems that are well within our ability to solve. In \r\ncountless spheres, we have promised action. Let us \r\nnow keep those promises for the good of our global \r\nfamily. \r\n The poetic summation of the American poet \r\nRobert Frost is apt: \r\n“I shall be telling this with a sigh  \r\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:  \r\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I —  \r\nI took the one less travelled by,  \r\nand that has made all the difference.” \r\nLet us choose with courage the road less travelled by. \r\nEach of us can make a difference, accordingly. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\nMr. Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear a statement by His Excellency \r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, Chairman of the Executive \r\nCommittee of the Palestine Liberation Organization \r\nand President of the Palestinian Authority. \r\n Mr. Abbas (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for this session. We \r\nwish you every success and express our confidence that \r\nyou will continue to pursue the great mission \r\nundertaken by the United Nations, which constitutes a \r\nmonumental achievement in the history of humankind \r\ntowards the promotion of dialogue and understanding \r\nand the resolution of issues and conflicts. That mission \r\ncontinues to be carried out in accordance with the rules \r\nand principles of international law, including \r\nhumanitarian law, and on the basis of covenants that \r\nare consistent with the spirit of the times and the needs \r\nof the Organization in resolving problems and conflicts \r\nand confronting the enormous challenges before us, \r\nincluding poverty, hunger, the environment and climate \r\nchange. \r\n On this occasion, I also wish to commend the role \r\nand positive contributions of your predecessor, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, during the sixty-second session of \r\nthe General Assembly. I would also like to express our \r\ndeep appreciation for the efforts, positions and \r\ninitiatives of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. They \r\nreflect his foresight and pragmatism regarding the \r\nvarious issues before us and in all regions that are \r\nsuffering crises and that pose threats to world peace, \r\nincluding in particular in the Middle East region.  \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n37 08-52272 \r\n \r\n I highly value the Secretary-General’s \r\nunderstanding of the need to address the political and \r\nhumanitarian issues concerning the Palestinian people \r\nand our region, along with the important role that \r\ncontinues to be played by various United Nations \r\nagencies, including the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA), which continues to shoulder great burdens, \r\nespecially in the Gaza Strip and in the refugee camps \r\nin the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. In the \r\nabsence of such a continuous, outstanding role, we \r\nwould have suffered even more severe and perilous \r\ncrises than we have experienced to date. \r\n This year, I should have liked to bear news of the \r\nachievement of a comprehensive agreement between us \r\nand our Israeli neighbours, bringing an end to the \r\nIsraeli occupation of our land since 1967 and to the \r\nsuffering of the millions of our people living as \r\nrefugees and displaced persons in exile from their \r\nhomeland. I believe that the entire world, with its \r\ndiffering alliances and trends, shares that desire with \r\nme, especially following the Annapolis conference late \r\nlast year and the relaunching of the political process. \r\nThat set the necessary guidelines for the advancement of \r\nnegotiations towards the conclusion of a comprehensive \r\nand complete agreement on all final status issues. Such \r\nan agreement would lead to the realization of peace \r\nwithin our region and allow it to enter a qualitatively new \r\nera of relations characterized by good-neighbourliness, \r\nmutual recognition, security and open borders, and not \r\nby walls and barriers. \r\n I am certain that never in the history of the \r\nconflict in our region have so many countries gathered \r\nas those that attended the Annapolis conference or \r\nparticipated in the consensus that arose there. Those \r\nwho met not only demanded vigorous action to \r\naccelerate and advance negotiations towards the \r\nachievement of a final peace agreement, but also \r\nexplicitly emphasized the need to remove all of the \r\nobstacles that have continuously impeded the \r\nnegotiating process and cast doubt on its credibility, \r\nusefulness and ability to actually resolve all aspects of \r\nthe conflict. The main obstacle I refer to is that of the \r\nIsraeli settlement campaign and its continuation \r\nthroughout the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nparticularly in East Jerusalem. \r\n All of the participants in Annapolis took a united, \r\nfirm and unprecedented stand calling for the immediate \r\ncessation of illegal settlement activities. It was \r\nrecognized that this was a prerequisite for allowing the \r\nnegotiations to resolve the conflict to lead to an end to \r\nthe occupation and the grave, historical injustices \r\ninflicted on our people over the long decades. \r\n The participation of most brotherly Arab \r\ncountries in the Annapolis conference was not merely a \r\nsymbolic gesture. On the contrary, their participation, \r\nin terms of both the level of attendance and the \r\nsubstance of positions, was a reflection of their \r\ngenuine desire to embrace and support the political \r\nprocess and to address it in real earnest on the basis of \r\nthe Arab peace initiative adopted at the Arab summit in \r\nBeirut in 2002. \r\n Allow me, from this rostrum to recall once again \r\nthe special importance of the Arab peace initiative. I do \r\nthis personally in order to draw attention to the \r\nsignificance of each of its platforms, because it \r\nrepresents a major joint Arab undertaking and offers a \r\nhistoric opportunity for us to achieve peace, security \r\nand mutual recognition for all. \r\n Indeed, it is strange to hear comments, which we \r\ndo not understand or accept, that are used to justify the \r\ncontinuing settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory and refer to the land \r\nas if it were not occupied territory or as if peace were \r\npossible without an end to the occupation of all of the \r\nArab territories occupied since 1967, including the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan and the Lebanese Sheba’a \r\nFarms, and without an end to the occupation of East \r\nJerusalem, the capital of our future Palestinian State \r\nand a city holy to hundreds of millions of the faithful \r\nof the monotheistic religions.  \r\n For the purpose of the noble and peaceful \r\nobjectives of building of a new Middle East free of \r\ndestructive mindsets and irrational tendencies that run \r\ncounter to the highest human values preached by all \r\nreligions and creeds — a new Middle East free of \r\nweapons of mass destruction — we have been and \r\nremain committed to international legitimacy. We \r\nextend our hands for dialogue and negotiation to \r\nresolve the conflict in a way that provides all that is \r\nrequired for coexistence and openness to the future so \r\nwe can build our societies and nations in accordance \r\nwith the aspirations of our peoples to progress and in \r\nthe spirit of the times. \r\n In that context, we express our full support for \r\nthe continuation of the indirect talks currently taking \r\nplace between Syria and Israel with the help of sisterly \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 38 \r\n \r\nTurkey. We hope that the process will culminate in the \r\nachievement of justice, the implementation of \r\ninternational resolutions and the affirmation of \r\ninternational legitimacy. \r\n For our part, we will continue to strive to achieve \r\nthe maximum possible progress in the current \r\nnegotiations between us and Israel through this year, \r\nbenefiting from past experience and relying on the \r\ndesire of all our peoples to realize a genuine and \r\ncomprehensive peace that will end decades of \r\noccupation and hostilities and result in the attainment \r\nof the two-State solution — the State of Palestine \r\nliving alongside the State of Israel on the basis of the \r\n1967 borders — and a just and agreed solution to the \r\nplight of the Palestinian refugees in accordance with \r\nresolution 194 (III). In referring to the benefits of past \r\nexperience, I wish to convey clearly that partial or \r\ninterim solutions or the dropping or deferral of those \r\ncore issues are unacceptable and unviable and will \r\nmaintain the roots of the conflict, thus undermining \r\nany achievement on the road to peace. The solution \r\nmust be comprehensive, complete, detailed and \r\nwholehearted. \r\n The solution we aspire to must include a \r\nmechanism to ensure its full and faithful \r\nimplementation pursuant to the timetable agreed upon. \r\nAll that inevitably requires international supervision of \r\nthe implementation of the solution, as well as a more \r\neffective role for the international Quartet in \r\nsafeguarding the solution we will reach and an \r\neffective guarantor role for the Security Council and \r\nvarious other United Nations bodies. \r\n At this juncture, I would like to express our \r\nappreciation for the role played by the United States \r\nAdministration, President George Bush and Secretary \r\nof State Condoleezza Rice in advancing the \r\nnegotiations and the peace process, as well as their \r\nefforts to remove the obstacles that stand in its way. I \r\nalso wish to commend the positions taken by the Arab, \r\nIslamic and non-aligned countries, which have always \r\ntaken firm stances in support of a just peace. I would \r\nlike to express our appreciation for the role played by \r\nthe European Union, which has supported our efforts in \r\nevery possible way, and the role and positions of the \r\nRussian Federation, the People’s Republic of China \r\nand Japan, as well as of our friends and colleagues in \r\nLatin America and Africa who have always supported \r\nthe advancement and continuity of the political \r\nprocess. \r\n As humankind celebrates the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, the conditions being endured by our people are \r\nincreasingly severe and complex. Our nation, which \r\npossesses only a small area of land, continues to suffer \r\nthe fragmentation and discontiguity of its cities and \r\nvillages as a result of more than 600 checkpoints and \r\nroadblocks on all main and secondary roads. There is \r\nno precedent for that in modern history. The harshest \r\nand most painful of those barriers are those that have \r\nsurrounded occupied East Jerusalem, severing the link \r\nbetween it and its Palestinian surroundings, not to \r\nmention changing the Islamic and Christian character \r\nof our city. \r\n Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian civilians \r\nhave become daily occurrences. At the same time, \r\nongoing tragedies strike every Palestinian family with \r\nthe continuing detention and imprisonment of over \r\n11,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. I know of no \r\nsituation in today’s world comparable to ours, where a \r\npeople is subject to the detention of such large numbers \r\nof its civilians and where prisons continue to be filled \r\nwith more and more accused who are guilty only of \r\nwanting to be free and of envisioning a future that is \r\ndifferent from the reality of occupation, siege and the \r\nloss of hope. \r\n Despite those harsh circumstances, our National \r\nAuthority and governing institutions have exerted \r\nevery possible effort to improve our conditions in all \r\nfields, including the security, economic, education, \r\nhealth and cultural sectors. \r\n I wish to express our gratitude to our brothers in \r\nthe Arab countries, to the General Secretariat of the \r\nLeague of Arab States, and to the whole international \r\ncommunity for all the important assistance extended to \r\nour people and our Authority in all aspects of the \r\nendeavour to restore the Palestinian economy, provide \r\nreal opportunities for its advancement, and rebuild the \r\nPalestinian security apparatus and the various \r\ninstitutions and agencies of the Palestinian Authority. \r\n In that regard, I wish to convey special thanks \r\nand appreciation to all the envoys from other countries \r\nwho have provided assistance in several fields, \r\nparticularly Mr. Tony Blair, the Quartet Special Envoy. \r\nIt is with pride that I can say that, even under those \r\nmost difficult conditions we have been able to achieve \r\nsecurity, the rule of law and public order for most of \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n39 08-52272 \r\n \r\nour towns and districts, despite all the remaining \r\nobstacles we have to confront. \r\n However, we will continue to follow that same \r\npath with firm determination and resolve. In that \r\nconnection, the Paris Donor’s Conference, followed by \r\nthe Bethlehem economic conference, were two special \r\noccasions in support of our national economy, our \r\nfinancial and economic institutions and treasury, and \r\nassistance to the Palestinian private sector, which has \r\nunwaveringly borne heavy burdens over the past years \r\nand has not failed to develop and progress. \r\n There is no doubt that the ongoing siege of the \r\nGaza Strip, where unemployment is endemic, is \r\ncompounding the tragic humanitarian crisis there. It is \r\nunprecedented in scope and scale, and the \r\nopportunities for education and medical care are \r\nscarce, punishing and causing the malnutrition of an \r\nentire generation with all the consequent risks for the \r\nfuture of the entire people. \r\n All of that is in addition to the transformation of \r\nthe Gaza Strip into a huge virtual prison holding nearly \r\n1.5 million Palestinians. We have exerted all efforts to \r\nget the siege on Gaza lifted, this dear part of our \r\nhomeland. In that regard, we express our deep \r\nappreciation for the role played by the brotherly Arab \r\ncountries, especially Egypt, to alleviate the suffering \r\nand to help us save our people from the extremely \r\ndifficult situation they find themselves in, including in \r\nparticular their efforts to end the division resulting \r\nfrom the bloody coup led by Hamas against Palestinian \r\nlegitimacy more than a year ago. \r\n As I have on more than one occasion, I would \r\nlike to reaffirm once again from this rostrum that we \r\nwill spare no effort to achieve Palestinian national \r\nreconciliation. We have already announced a \r\npreliminary plan that opens the door for this \r\nreconciliation to be realized and the formation of an \r\nindependent, impartial Government that is acceptable \r\nto all, but that will not place us back under siege again. \r\nThis Government will prepare for the holding of \r\nlegislative and presidential elections. We will continue \r\nbuilding a security apparatus based on professional \r\ntenets, with the support of Arab security. After the \r\ncompletion of those steps, it will be possible for us to \r\nproceed further towards strengthening our \r\nreconciliation and deepening the participation of all. If \r\nthat is not actualized, whoever rejects those principles \r\nand does not conform with them must bear the \r\nresponsibility before our entire people and before the \r\nArab and international positions that reject this \r\ndisintegration and division. \r\n In concluding my statement, I recall the words of \r\nour great Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, whom \r\nwe recently lost and whose loss was that of a great \r\ncultural and humanitarian symbol and icon. Mahmoud \r\nDarwish glorified life and cherished his homeland, \r\ncalling on our new generations to love life on their land \r\nand to preserve its continuity and to keep the torch \r\nalways lit. Mahmoud Darwish said,  \r\n“On this land there is something that deserves \r\nlife, on this land there was first the beginning and \r\nthe end — a land called Palestine — a name that \r\nwas and is and will endure”. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHer Excellency Ursula Plassnik, Federal Minister for \r\nEuropean and International Affairs of the Republic of \r\nAustria. \r\n Ms. Plassnik (Austria): These days, on our \r\ntelevision screens, images of thousands of parents \r\nconcerned about the health of their babies and children \r\nremind us of what lies at the very heart of our work — \r\nbuilding a better future for the coming generations, at \r\nhome as well as here in the United Nations. \r\n Armed conflict, climate change, poverty, hunger \r\nand the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nare the bleak challenges we face today, together with \r\nnew global challenges such as increasing food and \r\nenergy prices and financial turbulence. A sense of \r\nshared responsibility and true partnership based on \r\nequality are the key qualities that must guide our \r\nefforts to meet these challenges. \r\n All inhabitants of the global village have the right \r\nas well as the duty to contribute to the well-being of \r\nour community. At the global level, that needs to be \r\ndone in the framework of an effective world \r\norganization that enjoys the trust of States and \r\nGovernments but also of societies and individual \r\ncitizens. \r\n A just and effective international order needs to \r\nbe based on rules equally applicable to every member, \r\nbig or small, strong or weak. Respect for the rule of \r\nlaw is indispensable if we want to prevent conflicts and \r\npromote peace and sustainable development. Austria \r\nhas therefore consistently promoted efforts to develop \r\ninternational relations based on the principles of the \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 40 \r\n \r\nCharter of the United Nations and all the other \r\ninstruments that form our international legal system. \r\n Three weeks ago, 130 human rights experts and \r\npractitioners from around the world came together in \r\nVienna 15 years after the World Conference on Human \r\nRights held in Vienna in 1993. They formulated \r\nrecommendations on how to overcome the gap between \r\nhuman rights standards and the reality of their \r\nimplementation on the ground. Those recommendations \r\nhave been submitted to the General Assembly and the \r\nHuman Rights Council, and I hope they will contribute \r\nto the deliberations on the occasion of the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights on 10 December. \r\n One of the basic threats to the rule of law is \r\nimpunity. Today, international criminal justice, as \r\ndispensed by the International Criminal Court as well \r\nas by the special tribunals established by the Security \r\nCouncil, has become a major tool for bringing to \r\njustice those responsible for war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity.  \r\n Nowadays, some speak about the “peace — \r\njustice dilemma”. I personally remain convinced that \r\npeace and justice are complementary objectives, both \r\nare equally essential. There can be no lasting peace \r\nwithout justice, and international justice will serve its \r\npurpose most fully and effectively if it helps societies \r\nadvance reconciliation and overcome the wounds of the \r\npast. As women and children are often the most \r\nvulnerable in our societies, they deserve our special \r\nattention in this context. \r\n No country, no society can succeed without \r\nrecognizing the contribution of women. Worldwide, \r\nwomen are the politically and socially most relevant \r\nemerging power of the twenty-first century. Their \r\ncontribution must be valued publicly, their \r\nparticipation encouraged, their potential fully used. \r\nThere are countless success stories of women leaders \r\nwho make a difference in their communities as \r\nbusinesswomen, mothers, teachers, farmers, workers, \r\npeacemakers and lawmakers. \r\n At the same time, we hear appalling reports from \r\naround the world of discrimination and violence \r\nagainst women. How can we speak of human rights for \r\nwomen as long as one out of every three women \r\nworldwide has been beaten or abused? It is the \r\nresponsibility of each and every Government to act on \r\nthis. The United Nations must take the lead by setting \r\nclear targets and establishing a network to share best \r\npractices in combating violence against women. \r\n Last year, the Women Leaders Network called on \r\nthe Secretary-General to appoint more women to \r\nleadership positions in the United Nations, in particular \r\nin mediation and peacebuilding. I am pleased that the \r\nSecretary-General has since entrusted a number of \r\noutstanding women with key positions both at \r\nHeadquarters and in the field, and I encourage him to \r\ncontinue this policy. \r\n With regard to Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) on women, peace and security, the European \r\nUnion (EU) policy of targeted support for women in \r\nand through peace missions could be extended to other \r\nregional organizations such as the African Union. To \r\nassess the practical results of resolution 1325 (2000), I \r\npropose a thorough review process on the occasion of \r\nits tenth anniversary in 2010. \r\n Recent events in Georgia are a stark reminder that \r\nthe scourge of war still haunts our European \r\nneighbourhood. The European Union is ready to work \r\ntogether with the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the \r\nUnited Nations so that Georgia can return to peace, all \r\ninternally displaced people can return safely and a \r\nlasting solution based on full respect for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia is \r\nfound. I also call upon the Security Council to decide \r\non a timely prolongation of the United Nations \r\nObserver Mission in Georgia. \r\n As for the Western Balkans, I am heartened that \r\nwe are moving from the crisis management phase to \r\nthe integration phase. Today, thanks to the stabilizing \r\nrole of the EU, the peoples of the Western Balkans \r\nenjoy peace. Their future lies in the European Union. \r\n Austria welcomes the progress recently achieved \r\nin Zimbabwe. We hope that this will become another \r\nlasting example of the capacity of Africa for the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts on its continent. \r\nRegional ownership is the best option for success. \r\n Austria continues to actively support efforts to \r\nbring an end to decades of conflict in the Middle East. \r\nThree months ago, we hosted a donor conference in \r\nVienna for the reconstruction of the Nahr el-Bared \r\nrefugee camp in northern Lebanon in order to improve \r\nthe fate of the Palestinian refugees there and to support \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n41 08-52272 \r\n \r\nstability, the rule of law and economic development in \r\nLebanon. \r\n I commend the Israeli and Palestinian leadership \r\nfor their commitment to dialogue and negotiations \r\ndespite repeated efforts by radical forces to undermine \r\nthe process started in Annapolis nearly a year ago. \r\nOngoing settlements and expansion, however, put our \r\ncommon vision in question. The two-State solution \r\nremains the only possible path towards a peaceful and \r\nprosperous Middle East that can provide lasting \r\nsecurity to all its inhabitants. \r\n I remain convinced that in international relations as \r\ninside our own societies, we must always support \r\ndialogue. Austria will continue her long-standing \r\ncommitment to the dialogue of cultures and religions with \r\na clear focus on the contribution of religious leaders, \r\nwomen, young people, the media and educators. \r\n With some 500,000 victims each year, small arms \r\nand light weapons are today’s real weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Africa is the continent most heavily \r\naffected by this problem. Together with her African \r\npartners, Austria works for real progress on the \r\ndestruction of small arms as well as on the fight against \r\nthe illicit arms trade. We also cooperate in developing \r\nsuitable legal instruments. \r\n Austria is also deeply involved in establishing an \r\ninternational legally binding ban on cluster munitions. \r\nThe Convention on Cluster Munitions that we adopted \r\nin Dublin this year is a milestone in the field of \r\ndisarmament and humanitarian law. Austria will sign \r\nthe Convention in Oslo on 3 December 2008. I appeal \r\nto all other countries to sign as soon as possible so that \r\nthis treaty can enter into force swiftly. \r\n The need to prevent nuclear proliferation at a \r\ntime when an increasing number of countries are \r\nlooking towards nuclear power as a means to produce \r\nenergy calls for courageous and creative solutions. \r\nAustria has presented a proposal in the framework of \r\nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that aims \r\nat the comprehensive multilateralization of the nuclear \r\nfuel cycle. The goal is a fair system under which all \r\nStates who wish to receive nuclear fuel for an \r\nexclusively peaceful use can do so under equal \r\nconditions through the IAEA. \r\n With regard to the Iranian nuclear programme, we \r\nare convinced that the double-track approach is the \r\nbest way forward. At the same time, it is indispensable \r\nthat Iran fully complies with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. In this context we commend and \r\nstrongly support the efforts of the IAEA Director \r\nGeneral, Mohamed El Baradei. \r\n Let me draw the Assembly’s attention to the new \r\npartnership we developed and adopted at the Lisbon \r\nSummit in December 2007: the Joint Africa-European \r\nUnion Strategy based on the three aims of peace, \r\nsecurity and development. Without peace and security \r\nthere can be no sustainable development, and there is \r\nno security without human security. Human trafficking, \r\ndrugs, proliferation of weapons, unemployment and \r\ncrime — they all affect the very cohesion of our \r\nsocieties. \r\n In order to better address the challenges faced by \r\nAfrica, Austria, together with the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States and the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community, respectively, \r\nrecently organized a conference on peace and security \r\nin West Africa, in Ouagadougou, and a seminar on \r\npeace and development in Southern Africa, in \r\nJohannesburg. \r\n We need the turbo power of innovation to address \r\nglobal challenges. Climate change is not only \r\nresponsible for natural disasters but poses what is \r\nperhaps the most serious threat to the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For some \r\nsmall island States climate change and the resulting sea \r\nlevel rise are threats to their very existence. Austria \r\ntherefore welcomes the initiative by the Pacific island \r\nStates for a General Assembly resolution on the threat \r\nof climate change to international peace and security. \r\nUrgent action towards a global climate agreement by \r\nthe end of 2009 is the only way forward. We also \r\npropose to develop the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme into a fully fledged World Environment \r\nOrganization. Furthermore, we support the creation of \r\na new International Renewable Energy Agency. Vienna \r\nis a suitable location to host such an agency, as many \r\nof its United Nations offices already deal with energy \r\nquestions. \r\n Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger \r\ncontinues to be one of the main challenges of the \r\ninternational community. At the midpoint towards \r\n2015, success in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals has been uneven. While many \r\ncountries have made significant progress in attaining \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 42 \r\n \r\nsome of the Goals, only a few are likely to reach all of \r\nthem. Urgent and increased efforts by the international \r\ncommunity are, therefore, needed. The active \r\ncontribution towards this global effort is a priority for \r\nthe Austrian Government. \r\n As a matter of urgency we also have to tackle the \r\nmultiple and complex causes of the current global food \r\ncrisis. We welcome the High-Level Task Force set up \r\nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, which aims to \r\ncreate an international strategy for food security, and \r\nwe eagerly await the first concrete results. \r\n Small and medium-sized countries have a specific \r\ninterest in an international system based on effective \r\nmultilateralism and the rule of law. They form the \r\nbackbone of the United Nations. They can make a \r\ndifference and act as a driving force on many issues \r\nbeneficial to the world community. \r\n Since joining the United Nations more than \r\n50 years ago, Austria has consistently worked for \r\nmultilateral solutions to global challenges. Our \r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil is one expression of our determination to serve \r\nthe world Organization. That is the most important \r\nresponsibility that can be entrusted to a Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. We stand ready to assume that \r\nresponsibility and ask Members for their support. We \r\npledge to work for common solutions to our common \r\nglobal challenges in a sense of true partnership. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Santos López, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua. \r\n Mr. Santos López (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): On behalf of the delegation of the Republic \r\nof Nicaragua — cradle of Rubén Darío and Augusto C. \r\nSandino, the home of a people firmly committed to \r\ntheir principle, their efforts for a better world and their \r\ncalling for universal peace — I extend the brotherly \r\ngreeting of our President, Comandante Daniel Ortega \r\nSaavedra, and of all our authorities and citizens. \r\n Listening to the words of the representatives of \r\nthe States taking part in this sixty-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, we find that we have a common \r\nvision of the major serious problems affecting all \r\nhumankind today. In particular, we agree on the urgent \r\nneed to act as one in facing those problems and solving \r\nthem successfully, once and for all, for the benefit of \r\nthose who inhabit planet Earth. \r\n Hunger, poverty, the high cost of oil and food, the \r\ntragic consequences of climate change, terrorism, the \r\nurgent need to observe human rights worldwide, the \r\ntrafficking of and trade in persons, drug trafficking and \r\ncivil insecurity are, among other issues, matters that \r\nmust lead us to focus our attention and our efforts. \r\n At the same time, they are questions that arise \r\nfrom the nature and functioning of our Organization \r\nand that call for in-depth consideration so that we can \r\nmake this Organization more effective and democratic, \r\nwith sufficient guarantees, and so that all countries of \r\nthe world represented here can have our interests taken \r\ninto account, our voices heard and our will expressed \r\nin the most transparent and effective way possible.  \r\n For Nicaragua, an international system based on \r\nthe hegemony of a few over the majority is \r\nunthinkable. Such an anachronistic system, unjust in its \r\nvery essence, is the reason for the deep political, \r\neconomic and social inequality in the world. It is the \r\nreason for the accelerated and advanced arms race led \r\nby countries that have set themselves up as world \r\nreferees in situations affecting us all. It is the reason \r\nfor wars of aggression that behind the smokescreen of \r\nthe globalization of democracy and the promotion of \r\ncertain freedoms, illegally and illegitimately \r\nappropriate scarce energy and natural resources and \r\nlead to the political subjugation and grief of entire \r\npeoples deprived of their freedom, national \r\nindependence and their right to their own development. \r\n The international security situation has become \r\nincreasingly volatile in various parts of the world, \r\nbringing new threats to international peace and security \r\nand to peoples’ desire for peace. We must act \r\nintelligently, cautiously and resolutely to ensure that \r\nnew fratricidal wars do not assail the world. Therefore, \r\nwe agree with the priority given by the President of our \r\nGeneral Assembly to actions aimed at achieving \r\ncomprehensive and complete disarmament and nuclear \r\ncontrol. \r\n As a country that has fought and continues to \r\nfight for its independence, sovereignty and \r\nself-determination, and as the victim of military and \r\nforeign political intervention several times in its \r\nhistory, Nicaragua understood early on that there was \r\nno greater value than freedom. Our national heroes, \r\nthose who fought in our wars for freedom, are taintless \r\nwitnesses to the determination of the Nicaraguan \r\npeople to have a free homeland or death. \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n43 08-52272 \r\n \r\n The persistence of poverty and inequality in the \r\nworld today cannot be justified. Hunger and poverty \r\nare sapping economic and social progress for future \r\ngenerations. Despite the efforts made in recent years, \r\nthe gap between the rich and poor has continued to \r\ngrow, and millions of people now suffer from hunger \r\nand live in poverty or in extreme poverty. It is ethically \r\nand politically crucial to put an end to that long-\r\nstanding injustice to so many human beings. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nawait greater impetus from countries, primarily those \r\nwith larger economic resources, and from international \r\nfinancial organizations, which are also called upon to \r\ncontribute to their accomplishment. Those countries \r\nand bodies must clearly demonstrate their genuine \r\npolitical will to achieve all the MDGs and that they are \r\nnot merely paying lip service to them. \r\n It was established in the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nadopted at the International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, that the Bretton Woods institutions, \r\nthe World Trade Organization and the United Nations \r\nmust recognize the needs and interests of developing \r\ncountries and make them central to the work of the \r\nfinancing for development programme to be reviewed \r\nin Doha this year. \r\n By and large, we can say that most donors are not \r\nhonouring the pledges they made to increase their aid \r\nunconditionally. United Nations calculations on the \r\ntotal official development assistance needed between \r\n2010 and 2015 in order to achieve the MDGs amount \r\nto some $130 billion per year. However, global arms \r\nexpenditures in 2007 alone reached some $1.399 \r\ntrillion, according to the Stockholm International Peace \r\nResearch Institute. Today more than ever, the \r\ncommitment to allocating at least 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income for official development assistance \r\nwithout condition must be honoured so that developing \r\ncountries can have these resources available for our \r\nnational priorities. \r\n Nicaragua reiterates that, in order to consolidate \r\nour efforts in the coming years to eradicate poverty, \r\nextreme poverty, hunger and unemployment, we must \r\nfirst eradicate the unjust relationships among States. \r\nThose injustices can be felt most tangibly in unfair and \r\nimbalanced trade relations between the rich and the \r\npoor countries. \r\n My country calls for a fair international market \r\nand fair, democratic and balanced international trade \r\nthat will contribute to strengthening the economy of \r\nour countries, allow us to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, and end the criminalization of \r\nmigration by some receiving countries. \r\n We must ensure the maximum possible economic \r\ncomplementarity among all countries of the world. The \r\ndeveloping countries are working hard on that issue in \r\nthe context of South-South cooperation. We note the \r\nsuccesses that have been achieved in very little time in \r\nsome regions, such as the agreements between some \r\nLatin American and Caribbean countries.  \r\n The Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas has \r\nbecome a comprehensive platform for cooperation for a \r\nnumber of our countries, complementing their \r\neconomies. The complementarity we have built seeks \r\nto create advantages for our raw materials and \r\nagricultural products, as well as for our fishing, \r\nmineral and energy resources, to mention but a few. We \r\nneed complementarity, solidarity and the accelerated \r\ntransformation of purely economic relationships based \r\non a sense of shared responsibility and unity in the face \r\nof the major challenges of the present and the future. \r\n Nothing could be further from that spirit than \r\nunbridled capitalism, which is speculative and \r\ninefficient and has led the world economy into a \r\nserious crisis the effects of which, according to some \r\nexperts, we are only just beginning to feel, as we have \r\nseen recently in the United States financial system. \r\n Just a few hours ago, the President of the World \r\nBank, Robert Zoellick, told the world press that the \r\nUnited States financial crisis will have a severe effect \r\non development assistance, primarily that earmarked \r\nfor the poorest countries. In other words, the crisis in \r\nthe financial system will have serious repercussions on \r\nour peoples. The same solutions being sought to avoid \r\ncollapse will need to include measures to ensure that \r\nour peoples are not affected by a crisis that we have not \r\nbrought on ourselves but that we may pay for with \r\nworsening poverty and a further delay in our \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We have also seen that multilateralism in \r\ninternational relations is a means to achieve mutually \r\nrespectful relationships and peaceful coexistence and \r\nto implement development policies based on our own \r\nrealities. In that conviction, we have been actively \r\ncommitted to the principles and objectives of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement. The reconciliation and national \r\nunity Government of Nicaragua, presided over by \r\nA/63/PV.11  \r\n \r\n08-52272 44 \r\n \r\nPresident Daniel Ortega Saavedra, is firmly committed \r\nto that vision of the world and is working hand in hand \r\nwith the people to rebuild a country that, after almost \r\ntwo decades of neoliberalism following a decade of \r\nunjust war that was firmly condemned by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, was in a state of \r\npolitical, social and economic collapse. \r\n Our Government seeks to overcome poverty and \r\nto transform Nicaragua through a new alternative \r\nmodel of development that is more just and a new \r\npower structure that is truly democratic. Citizens will \r\nplay a leading role in carrying out that task and will \r\ndirectly redefine the path of the country in line with \r\ntheir own interests. \r\n We propose to improve the quality of life of our \r\npeople by basing our policies on principles to defend \r\nthe environment and nature and to conserve our natural \r\nheritage. We must establish a participatory new world \r\nenvironmental order with clearly set goals that puts an \r\nend to the commercial and utilitarian exploitation of \r\nour planetary resources that, as has now been proven, \r\nare being depleted at an uncontrollable rate. Those \r\nefforts must also include the commitment of the \r\ncountries that are the largest emitters of the greenhouse \r\ngases that have resulted in global warming and have \r\nalready had other negative and irreversible effects on \r\nthe planet.  \r\n We are also focusing on the development of food \r\nsovereignty as a means of feeding our people through \r\nour own domestic efforts and through unconditional \r\nsolidarity with brotherly peoples. At the same time, \r\nfood security will guarantee that every Nicaraguan has \r\nreliable access to nutritious food at a fair cost so as to \r\nlead a healthy and active life. \r\n We are developing programmes to eradicate \r\nhunger and profiteering. We are providing low-cost \r\nseeds, stoves and butane tanks for low-income \r\nfamilies. We are also supporting small businesses and \r\nworking for the establishment of a bank to encourage \r\nproduction. \r\n For Nicaragua, the word “solidarity” is not an \r\nempty concept, but rather the cement of the society we \r\nwish to build. With that in mind, I cannot fail to stress \r\nat this general debate the solidarity of my people with \r\nthe Government and people of Bolivia, who have been \r\nsubject to unacceptable and ongoing attempts to \r\ndestabilize the country. The indigenous people of \r\nBolivia, led by President Evo Morales, have taught us \r\nall a lesson in democracy by defending the democracy \r\nthat they have gained after years of humiliating \r\nmarginalization. \r\n Once again, Nicaragua denounces the cruel \r\nblockade maintained against Cuba in violation of \r\ninternational law. That pathological obsession against \r\nCuba seems to justify all actions and ignores that \r\ncountry’s own problems in combating the terrorism \r\nthat has been brought from this country to that \r\nCaribbean island. The five Cuban patriots who have \r\nbeen jailed in Florida for attempting to prevent terrorist \r\nacts against the Cuban people should be set free. \r\n Although it may seem untrue, the process of \r\ndecolonization is not over. Entire peoples are still \r\noppressed and denied their right to independence and \r\nto self-determination. We salute and stand side by side \r\nwith the people of Puerto Rico and the Western Sahara, \r\nwith the Polisario Front, and with Argentina in \r\nopposition to the occupation of the Malvinas Islands. \r\nWe also firmly reiterate our call for freedom for the \r\nCypriot people and for putting an end to the partition \r\nof that great nation.  \r\n We support a comprehensive and peaceful \r\nsolution in the Middle East that will end once and for \r\nall the horrors of war and allow the Palestinian and \r\nIsraeli people to live as brothers and sisters, and in \r\nwhich the Palestinian people can finally enjoy all of \r\ntheir rights and have a State of their own. \r\n We are convinced that, if we are to achieve the \r\nnoble objectives embraced by our Organization, we \r\nneed the true political will to devote time and energy to \r\nreviewing our own house. That is even more important \r\nin a world of constant change and crisis and requires \r\neach of us — our peoples and our States — to be active \r\nparticipants in our own future. As has been said before, \r\nwe must work together to democratize the United \r\nNations. We are pleased to welcome the proposal of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to hold a high-level \r\ndialogue on the democratization of the Organization, in \r\nwhich we would consider one by one the pressing \r\nproblems of and between its various bodies. We are \r\nprepared to play a constructive role in that necessary \r\nand urgent dialogue. \r\n The times our peoples are facing and the \r\nresponsibilities we have here in this house will be \r\ndecisive for millions of people, now and for future \r\ngenerations. It is urgent that we find points of \r\n A/63/PV.11\r\n \r\n45 08-52272 \r\n \r\nconvergence so that we can work together to meet the \r\nchallenges of the times and our responsibilities.  \r\n The United Nations Charter is a fundamental \r\nreference point to guide our action. In respecting the \r\nCharter and ensuring that it is respected, we are \r\nrespecting ourselves. Its principles must prevail over \r\nselfish and petty interests. Above all, the future of \r\nhumankind is at stake. \r\n Nicaragua reaffirms its call for peace and \r\nhumanism to contribute to a more just, more humane \r\nand more united world in which individual destinies, \r\ninterconnected and inspired by their love of justice and \r\nfreedom, come together in the universal task of \r\ncreating a world that is better for all. \r\n As was said yesterday at the high-level event on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, the unjust \r\ninternational order in which we live must change if it is \r\nto be credible, legitimate and effective. Fundamental \r\ndecisions cannot continue to be taken by one, seven or \r\neight stakeholders and without the participation of the \r\nvast majority of humankind. Solutions to this situation \r\nare well known and well accepted, at least in principle.  \r\n Through the millenniums and centuries, our \r\nspecies has developed institutions — and above all,  \r\n \r\nlaw — in order to govern human relations and to \r\nmediate conflicts through peaceful means. More \r\nrecently, humankind has developed democracy to that \r\nend and, in particular, in order to structure power and \r\nauthority peacefully. Those are the solutions that our \r\nspecies has developed over the millenniums, and it is \r\ndifficult to imagine another alternative.  \r\n The question before us now is whether we have \r\nthe political will to apply democracy at the \r\ninternational level, beginning by democratizing the \r\nUnited Nations and by strengthening international law \r\nwithin the framework of United Nations institutions. \r\nThat is the solution. That is what will overcome the \r\nchronically postponed solutions to problems and help \r\nus to deal efficiently with urgent new problems. It is \r\npossible. Why not? We are speaking of human \r\ninstitutions that we ourselves can change. The question \r\nis whether or not we have the political will to do so. I \r\npropose that we work together at this sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly to build that political \r\nwill through increasingly broader progressive \r\nconsensus. \r\nThe meeting rose at 2.10 p.m.  \r\n \r\n"
