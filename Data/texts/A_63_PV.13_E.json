(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Pham Gia Khiem, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam. \r\n Mr. Pham Gia Khiem (Viet Nam): Allow me \r\nfirst to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. I am confident that you will ably guide our \r\nsession to a great success. I would also like to \r\ncommend His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his \r\nimportant contribution to the work of the Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session. \r\n While the trend of peace, cooperation and \r\ndevelopment continues to prevail, there have been \r\ncomplex developments in the world over the past year. \r\nLocal conflicts endure, acts of terrorism still occur in \r\nmany parts of the world and new tensions have \r\nemerged in Europe, including in the Balkans and the \r\nCaucasus. At the same time, the world is experiencing \r\nthe most severe economic uncertainties since the 1997-\r\n1998 financial crisis, together with new challenges \r\nsuch as climate change and the food and energy \r\nsecurity crises. More than ever, the current situation \r\ncompels nations to promote dialogue and cooperation \r\nto surmount common challenges, both man-made and \r\nnatural.  \r\n Viet Nam supports efforts to end violence in \r\nAfghanistan and Iraq.  \r\n We should also work to facilitate further progress \r\nin the search for lasting peaceful solutions to the \r\nnuclear issues on the Korean peninsula and Iran on the \r\nbasis of due respect both for the legitimate rights of \r\nStates to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes and for the regime of non-proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons.  \r\n In follow-up to the Annapolis outcome, I wish to \r\nreaffirm Viet Nam’s support for the role of the Quartet, \r\nthe League of Arab States, regional countries and the \r\nUnited Nations, especially the Security Council, in the \r\nquest for a lasting solution in the Middle East. Such a \r\nsolution should respect the inalienable rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, including their right to establish an \r\nindependent State of their own, and the principle of \r\nland for peace. \r\n As leaders of the world gathered here to discuss \r\nthe development needs of Africa, we were keenly \r\naware of the organic relationship between peace and \r\ndevelopment. Viet Nam undertakes to work closely \r\nwith the United Nations and the African Union to find \r\npeaceful solutions to the conflicts and disputes that still \r\nrage on the continent. \r\n New uncertainties are unfolding in the global \r\neconomic and financial situation. Climate change and \r\nenergy and food shortages are becoming more and \r\nmore serious global issues. In the face of that situation, \r\nit is essential to enhance international cooperation to \r\novercome these problems. In that regard, developed \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 2 \r\n \r\ncountries should take measures to maintain their \r\nmacroeconomic and financial stability and implement \r\ninternational commitments to improve international \r\neconomic relations and the transfer of technology. Such \r\ncooperation is possible and effective only when due \r\nregard is given to each country’s specific conditions, \r\nlegitimate concerns and interests. \r\n Given the complex developments in the world, \r\nthe United Nations has a greater role to play in saving \r\nhumankind from the scourge of war and in finding \r\nsolutions to problems. The United Nations must be \r\nstrengthened to that end. Democratic and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations — \r\nincluding the General Assembly, the Security Council, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the specialized \r\nagencies — will make the Organization more effective \r\nand efficient in the areas of work mandated by the \r\nCharter. Viet Nam will continue to contribute to efforts \r\naimed at making the United Nations more democratic, \r\nmore effective and more responsive to the needs of the \r\npeoples of the world.  \r\n In Viet Nam, the Government is working with \r\nUnited Nations agencies and other development \r\npartners to implement the One UN initiative. We hope \r\nand believe that the experiences of Viet Nam and the \r\nUnited Nations in implementing that pilot reform \r\nprogramme will be useful to other aid recipient \r\ncountries and to the United Nations reform process \r\noverall. \r\n In line with its foreign policy of independence, \r\nsovereignty, peace, cooperation and development and \r\nits efforts to deeply engage with the world, Viet Nam \r\nhas seriously observed its commitments and actively \r\nparticipated in addressing global issues. We strongly \r\nsupport the Bali Road Map, which aims to establish the \r\nlegal framework for international cooperation in \r\naddressing climate change beyond 2012. Despite \r\nnatural disasters and epidemics, Viet Nam is honouring \r\nits commitments to maintain the volume of its rice \r\nexports at 4 million tons annually. We intend to \r\ncontinue those efforts to ease the pressures caused by \r\nthe rising price of food and to preserve food security. \r\n The year 2008 marks the first time that Viet Nam \r\nhas assumed responsibilities as a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council. In its desire to make \r\ngreater contributions to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, Viet Nam has \r\nparticipated in the work of the Council as a \r\nconstructive and responsible member. We shall \r\ncontinue to uphold the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter while working with other Council members \r\nand Members of the United Nations to find solutions \r\nthat serve the interests of international peace and \r\nsecurity and the legitimate interests of all countries and \r\nparties concerned. \r\n In the 63 years since its establishment, the United \r\nNations has traversed numerous upheavals of history \r\nand acquired an increasingly significant role in \r\ninternational relations. Against that backdrop, and with \r\ntrust in the power of peoples’ will and determination to \r\nstrive for peace, cooperation and development, we are \r\nstrongly confident that the international community \r\nwill overcome new challenges and that the United \r\nNations will continue to live up to the expectations of \r\nall the peoples of the world. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency The Honourable Puka Temu, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. \r\n Mr. Temu (Papua New Guinea): On behalf of my \r\npeople and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I \r\nbring the General Assembly warm greetings and pledge \r\nour support to you, Mr. President, as you guide us in \r\nour work. We also wish to thank Mr. Kerim, your \r\npredecessor, for his strong advocacy during his tenure \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession, especially in the area of climate change. We \r\nalso support Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the \r\nUnited Nations in general, especially its agencies, in \r\nthe work they do to enhance our development \r\naspirations in Papua New Guinea. As we have always \r\ndone, my Government continues to support the United \r\nNations.  \r\n The United Nations currently provides the world \r\nforum for Member States to address the many global \r\nissues we face together. United Nations reforms need \r\nto be carried out in all the relevant areas of the system. \r\nWe need to address the international gender \r\narchitecture to make it more robust, responsive and \r\neffective. It has to be part of the core reform process to \r\ncater for women, youth and children. We must also be \r\nvigilant against terrorism and threats to international \r\npeace and security. The One UN system needs to be \r\ntranslated more meaningfully in order to effectively \r\nenhance each Member State’s development priorities. \r\n We support the call for the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n3 08-53122 \r\n \r\ncategories of membership. A number of emerging \r\ndeveloping countries need to be accorded permanent \r\nstatus on the Council to better reflect today’s \r\ncircumstances. We therefore welcome the recent \r\nconsensus to initiate the intergovernmental negotiating \r\nprocess to properly address the long-standing but \r\ncritical issue of United Nations reform. \r\n We live in a world that provides us many \r\nopportunities, as well as formidable development \r\nchallenges. The challenges include addressing the \r\ndestructive effects of the illicit use of small arms and \r\nlight weapons and the need to address globalization \r\nand food and energy security, which lead into the wider \r\nissue of human security. \r\n Additionally, the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange and global warming continue to threaten the \r\nexistence of many small island States, especially due to \r\nrising sea levels. For many small island States, sea \r\nlevel rise and the adverse impacts of climate change \r\nare security issues threatening their very survival. We \r\ntherefore call upon the international community to act \r\nurgently in order to ensure the security and welfare of \r\nsmall island developing States. \r\n As a thriving democracy in the Pacific, Papua \r\nNew Guinea desires to see our friends and neighbours \r\nin the Pacific and beyond enjoy freedom and \r\nprosperity. In that regard, and consistent with the \r\ndecision of the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, \r\nPapua New Guinea strongly encourages Fiji to restore \r\nparliamentary democracy by preparing for elections \r\nand holding them in 2009. However, Fiji must be \r\nsupported throughout, and not isolated in its efforts to \r\naddress its specific national circumstances.  \r\n On other regional issues, Papua New Guinea \r\ncommends the work done so far on the Pacific Plan for \r\nStrengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration, \r\nwhich we believe may catalyse our region’s \r\ndevelopment. It is Papua New Guinea’s strong view \r\nthat Member States from the Pacific region should be \r\ncategorized separately by the United Nations in terms \r\nof aggregated data and in the area of social and \r\neconomic classification. While Papua New Guinea is \r\nready, we can support Vanuatu’s call for an extension \r\nto the May 2009 deadline for submissions on an \r\nextended continental shelf. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nprovide us with one of the greatest opportunities to \r\nleverage our development process. For that reason, we \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for convening the \r\nhigh-level meeting on the MDGs during the present \r\nsession of the General Assembly. However, for the \r\nMDGs to be effectively implemented, they must be \r\naddressed consistent with national circumstances and \r\nwith host-country leadership. Further, for the MDGs to \r\nbe effective over the long term, developing countries \r\nmust take ownership of the Goals. \r\n At the midway point of MDG implementation, for \r\nPapua New Guinea, we believe there is cause for \r\ncautious optimism. Papua New Guinea celebrated \r\n33 years of unbroken constitutional democracy on \r\n16 September this year. Due to the political stability \r\nachieved by my Government, we can now afford to \r\nplan long-term for our own development. We have had \r\nsteady economic growth in the last five years, due to \r\nprudent economic management that has resulted in five \r\nsuccessive budget surpluses. \r\n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\nremains an integral development priority for my \r\nGovernment. We have set ourselves 15 national targets \r\nand 67 indicators, which have been integrated into our \r\nmedium-term development strategy and sectoral plans. \r\n For example, Papua New Guinea recognizes that \r\neducation is a prerequisite for the betterment of our \r\npeople’s lives. That is entrenched in our constitution \r\nand prioritized under a 10-year national education plan. \r\nThe current one-laptop-per-child pilot project will \r\nmake learning accessible, enjoyable and fruitful for our \r\nchildren, while bridging the digital divide. We are \r\nlooking to expand the project nationwide during the \r\nAfrica Caribbean Pacific-European Union Joint \r\nParliamentary Assembly, to be held in Papua New \r\nGuinea in November. In partnership with UNICEF, we \r\nhave also introduced proactive programmes aimed at \r\naccelerating the girl-child’s access to education. \r\n In the area of health, there remain major \r\nchallenges, such as maternal mortality and HIV/AIDS, \r\nwhich the Government is now addressing through the \r\n10-year national health plan. We have also recorded \r\nsome positive results in other major health indicators, \r\nincluding a decrease in malaria incidence and in \r\nmalaria-related deaths, and the stabilization and \r\ndecline of infant and child mortality. \r\n Ultimately, reducing poverty, expanding access to \r\neducation and health and empowering women through \r\neconomic and social participation are what we in my \r\nGovernment are addressing. \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 4 \r\n \r\n Millennium Development Goal 8 makes reference \r\nto partnerships. We strongly believe that Goal is \r\ncritical to the achievement of the other seven. We \r\nbelieve, however, that all partnerships must be \r\nunderpinned by mutual respect among the partners. For \r\nthat reason, let me highlight some key partnerships. \r\nOur partnerships with Australia, New Zealand, the \r\nEuropean Union, Japan, China, Italy, Austria and many \r\nnon-governmental organizations continue to contribute \r\nstrongly to Papua New Guinea’s development. We also \r\npartner with the Coral Triangle Initiative on coral reefs, \r\nfisheries and food security, and the Forest-11 Group, \r\nlaunched last year by His Excellency the President of \r\nIndonesia. Another important partnership is with the \r\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation, facilitated by the \r\nClinton Foundation, in the area of HIV/AIDS and the \r\nprovision of antiretrovirals. \r\n To succeed, we must significantly scale up our \r\npartnerships. Often, we all tend to wallow in the \r\nnegative — environmental degradation, catastrophic \r\nclimate change, crippling poverty, ineffective \r\ngovernance — rather than leveraging the positive. My \r\nGovernment’s vision is to transform those societal \r\nchallenges into a framework for environmentally and \r\nsocially sustainable economic growth. It is time to cast \r\noff policy chains of the past and create a new paradigm \r\nfor the future. \r\n Let me be specific. First, we cannot account for \r\nthe environment as an externality. Our natural \r\nenvironment and its services are not free to society. \r\nOnce we lose those services, often irreversibly, the \r\ncosts can be significant. \r\n Secondly, we must create a broad framework for \r\necosystem service markets. Carbon sequestration must \r\nonly be the first step, followed by valuations for \r\nbiodiversity, water purification, rainfall generation, \r\ncrop pollination and food security.  \r\n Thirdly, we must now view our natural \r\nenvironment as an engine for wealth creation. Those \r\nvaluable ecosystem services must be transformed into \r\nlasting wealth that supports the rural communities that \r\nhave traditionally cared for those assets. \r\n Let me use the issue of reducing deforestation \r\nand forest degradation — an issue that our Prime \r\nMinister, Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, has \r\nchampioned internationally — as an example. \r\nDeforestation is a complex subject, but, put simply, it \r\nis driven by the fact that the world values forests more \r\ndead than alive. Traditional economic theory, which \r\nconsiders ecosystem services a common good and thus \r\nfree to all, is primarily responsible for the massive loss \r\nof the world’s forests. \r\n With those ecosystem services valued at zero, \r\nrural communities that depend on and care for forests \r\nmust make a living in other ways. Keeping the land \r\nforested means sacrificing the opportunities to be \r\ngained by converting it to other uses, such as \r\nproducing commodities such as timber, palm oil, coffee \r\nand cocoa. The international commodity markets, in \r\nfact, have hardly changed from colonial times. \r\n In many ways, those two economic relics are \r\nincreasingly perverse and nonsensical. The \r\nenvironment is devastated, rural communities stay poor \r\nand the rich shift the blame. They cite lack of \r\ngovernance and corruption, but those are not drivers of \r\ndeforestation, but symptoms of obsolete market \r\nconstructs. \r\n Therefore, global leaders must redraft economic \r\ntheory and reinvent global markets for a sustainable \r\nfuture. For example, the latest estimate is that \r\napproximately $20 billion a year will be needed to \r\nhalve carbon emissions resulting from deforestation. \r\nHowever, that would be a wise investment, even for \r\nthat one ecosystem service alone. Forests sequester \r\nsome 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. So, \r\nwith today’s price of more than $30 per ton of carbon \r\ndioxide, rural communities are effectively subsidizing \r\nthe carbon emissions of the rich to the tune of \r\napproximately $100 billion per year — more than total \r\nannual official development assistance.  \r\n Norway has provided great leadership towards \r\nthat necessary paradigm shift. First, Norway has stood \r\nup against global climate change and has targeted the \r\nachievement of carbon neutrality by 2030. Norway has \r\nalso dedicated $2.8 billion to offset emissions \r\nreductions resulting from deforestation in developing \r\ncountries, through the valuation of forest ecosystem \r\nservices. \r\n Faced by the ravages of climate change on a \r\nsmall island developing State, our Prime Minister, Sir \r\nMichael Somare, has charted out his own bold goals: \r\nreducing Papua New Guinea’s emissions by 50 per cent \r\nbefore 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality before \r\n2050. Sharing a similar vision, the partnership of \r\nleadership between Papua New Guinea and Norway \r\nmay significantly address several of the greatest \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n5 08-53122 \r\n \r\nchallenges of our time: effectively valuing global \r\nenvironmental services, contributing to the mitigation \r\nof climate change, conserving global biodiversity and \r\nfinancing the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in rural areas. \r\n Finally, our global economy values companies in \r\nthe billions simply for advertising trinkets on the \r\nInternet. Some countries make billions by selling fossil \r\nfuels that pollute our atmosphere, others by producing \r\nlow-cost consumer products that humanity does not \r\nrequire. In fact, Google is worth $150 billion, while the \r\nworld’s last great tropical forests left standing are \r\nworth nothing. How can that be right?  \r\n Together, we must reconstruct our value \r\nframeworks. New environmental markets must support \r\ntropical countries striving to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment, by generating billions from rainforest \r\necosystem services that humanity has so far been \r\nexploiting for free. \r\n Several communities in my country have voted to \r\ncancel their logging concessions, telling me that the \r\nforests and rivers have provided all they needed for \r\nthousands of years. In some ways, however, they now \r\nfeel trapped. The old ways allowed them to survive but \r\ndid not prepare their children for an increasingly \r\ncomplex future. They now struggle with schools that \r\ncannot afford the best teachers and with health centres \r\nthat provide only basic medicines. Yet those \r\ncommunities still remember how to live sustainably — \r\na skill that many others have forgotten in the rush to \r\nget ahead. \r\n But there is hope. Bold leadership is required on \r\nboth sides of the economic divide to transform the way \r\nin which we value our environment and create wealth \r\nfor rural populations. As leaders, we must understand \r\nthat, while we may have inherited the Earth from our \r\nforefathers, we have in fact borrowed it from our \r\ngrandchildren and our future generations. Indeed, by \r\nlearning to save our environment, perhaps we can once \r\nagain learn how to save ourselves and guarantee a \r\nbetter world for our future generations.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Antonio García Belaunde, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Peru. \r\n Mr. García Belaunde (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI should like to begin by greeting you, Sir, \r\ncongratulating you on your election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We \r\nare certain that your experience will enable us to have \r\nfruitful and constructive exchanges on the urgent \r\nchallenges currently facing humanity. Thus, we \r\nreaffirm our commitment to contributing to the \r\nachievement of positive results during this session. \r\n Fighting poverty and creating opportunities to \r\npromote social inclusion are priorities of the \r\nGovernment of President Alan García Pérez, and we \r\nare therefore pleased that the General Assembly has \r\nrightly chosen the theme of poverty — a challenge \r\nrequiring a global and comprehensive response — as \r\nthe central focus of discussion for the present session.  \r\n Peru has been affected by the negative \r\nrepercussions of the increase in food and fuel prices, \r\nwhich are felt most intensely by the poorest \r\nindividuals. In my country, we are working responsibly \r\nto find appropriate responses that can sustainably meet \r\nthe challenge of enhancing food security. At the same \r\ntime, we are adopting urgent measures to assist those \r\nmost affected by rising food prices. The direct \r\nrelationship between poverty and rising food prices \r\nshould lead us to develop new and more ambitious \r\nformulas for international cooperation that are \r\ncommensurate with the magnitude of the problem and \r\ntake into account all aspects of poverty in a \r\ncomprehensive manner.  \r\n Against that backdrop, I wish to highlight a new \r\nthreat to the possibilities of development: a grave \r\ninternational financial crisis whose scale is still \r\nunknown. At its roots lies an unfortunate and \r\nirresponsible combination of regulatory loopholes, real \r\nestate inflation, reckless mortgages and financial \r\nleverages without a sound basis in the real economy. \r\nThis could lead the world into a crisis of confidence \r\nand undermine the considerable progress that \r\ndeveloping regions have made in their fight against \r\npoverty. Given those phenomena, we await decisive \r\nresponses and actions by the developed countries to \r\nsupport the financial system and avert the great risks of \r\nthis crisis.  \r\n In the case of Peru, I can say that this turbulence \r\nwill not cause us to abandon our ongoing policies of \r\ninvesting, creating productive jobs, increasing tax \r\nrevenues and promoting growth. Peru has been very \r\nsuccessfully implementing a programme of \r\ncomprehensive, inclusive and decentralized \r\ndevelopment based on two pillars: an economic policy \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 6 \r\n \r\nwith the clear objectives of growth and job creation, \r\ntaking advantage of the country’s multifaceted \r\npotential; and a social policy that honours the \r\ncommitment to reduce poverty, increase social \r\ninclusion and promote equality of opportunity. \r\n That approach has brought into our economy not \r\nonly financial resources, but also advanced \r\ntechnologies and management capacities that improve \r\nand stimulate the competitiveness of our production, \r\nthus increasing and diversifying exportation. As a \r\nresult of that approach, the creation of direct and \r\nindirect employment has increased in an unprecedented \r\nway in many areas of the country and thousands of \r\nsmall and medium entrepreneurs have been \r\nincorporated into the market in an economy that boosts \r\ninitiative and creative capacity.  \r\n Based on those premises, Peru has made steady \r\nprogress in recent years, with the growth rate reaching \r\n9.1 per cent in 2007 and forecast to reach over 9 per \r\ncent this year. There is, further, a major increase in the \r\ndomestic component, which is a driving force in the \r\neconomy. \r\n But to those positive macroeconomic figures we \r\nshould add the important results in the management of \r\nthe major components of the social model, such as the \r\nexpanding social, education and health services as well \r\nas basic assistance to the poorest. Through the social \r\npolicy, the Peruvian Government has achieved, in only \r\ntwo years, a remarkable reduction of more than 5 per \r\ncent in poverty and almost 3 per cent in extreme \r\npoverty. Infant mortality has also fallen by 51.6 per \r\ncent and illiteracy levels have also been reduced by \r\n5.7 per cent. We have also established an objective of \r\nreducing chronic child malnutrition by 5 per cent by \r\n2011. We are seeking to enhance the management and \r\nincrease the impact of the social expenditures of the \r\nState. \r\n Those achievements ensure that in the case of \r\nPeru the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will \r\nbe met prior to the 2015 deadline in areas such as \r\npoverty reduction, nutrition, literacy, health and \r\neducation, among others. We also see that the role of \r\ninternational cooperation was fundamental in our being \r\nable to bring to remote areas social, education and \r\nproduction projects that, in a sustainable manner, raise \r\nthe standard of living of members of rural \r\ncommunities. The combination of the national effort \r\nfor inclusion and international cooperation should be \r\nmaintained in order to achieve, as soon as possible, the \r\nfull involvement of the Peruvian social fabric in \r\nnational development.  \r\n In recognition of all of those advances, of the \r\neconomic stability of the country and of the prevailing \r\nlegal security, three important international risk \r\nindicators have given Peru its investment grade. \r\nConsistent with this positive evolution of the economic \r\nperception of my country, foreign investment increased \r\nby more than 23 per cent in 2007 and is expected to \r\nfurther increase this year. \r\n Our growth is also based on expanding the \r\nmarkets, which we have done through regional and \r\nbilateral free trade agreements entered into with the \r\nUnited States, Chile, Thailand, Canada and Singapore. \r\nWe hope to conclude further agreements soon with \r\nSouth Korea and China. We are conducting trade \r\nnegotiations with the European Union and the Andean \r\ncountries, a process that we hope will be satisfactorily \r\nconcluded in 2009. Furthermore, we are ready to \r\nengage in negotiations with as many countries as \r\npossible, to enable us to boost trade. \r\n There is a broad consensus regarding the shared \r\nresponsibility of countries of origin and receiving \r\ncountries in dealing with the phenomenon of migration. \r\nIts causes have a global dimension, and so should its \r\ntreatment. It is a tool of development, both in \r\noriginating and receiving countries and in the migrant \r\ncommunities themselves. We should look at the central \r\nrole of migration in terms of creating opportunities for \r\ngenerating wealth and progress, for diversity and for \r\nbuilding more tolerant multicultural spaces. \r\n The responsible and constructive handling of \r\ninternational migration should begin with the practical \r\nuse of international instruments for the protection of \r\nmigrants. Therefore, the United Nations, together with \r\nStates, must redouble its efforts to implement measures \r\nthat will make it possible to ensure respect for the \r\nhuman rights of migrants, migrant workers and their \r\nfamilies.  \r\n For this reason, in Peru we have been promoting \r\nand continue to promote the handling of this matter \r\nboth in the United Nations and in other forums with a \r\nview to establishing mechanisms for exchange of \r\ninformation and specialized knowledge, undertaking \r\nstanding consultations and forging closer cooperation \r\nbetween the Global Forum for Migration and \r\nDevelopment and the United Nations. We must make \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n7 08-53122 \r\n \r\ncivil society aware of the benefits and contributions of \r\nmigration and continue with dialogue and coordination \r\nin multilateral forums, without stopping the progress \r\ntowards agreements. \r\n The concern about poverty and economic growth \r\nrequires an examination of the sustainability of \r\ndevelopment ideas and the most relevant \r\nenvironmental priorities. We need to deal with security \r\nand the rational use of water for agriculture and for \r\npersonal use, deforestation control, soil degradation \r\nand environmental pollution, among others. We are \r\nworking on these issues with the most advanced \r\nregulations, a product of our own experience. We have \r\nto approach these matters organically. In the case of \r\nPeru, we established the Ministry for the Environment \r\na few months ago. We insist that national development \r\nprogrammes take account of the quality of life and the \r\nsustainability of land-use models and of natural \r\nresources.  \r\n Global warming requires us to work intensively \r\nwith the entire international community to reduce \r\nemissions, which are the fundamental reason for the \r\nrise in global temperatures and their already visible \r\nconsequences. Peru is witnessing a rapid retreat of its \r\ntropical glaciers, which is threatening the water-supply \r\nregime in the most populated and heavily agricultural \r\nareas. We want to confirm our conviction on the \r\npressing importance of advancing from the platform \r\nadopted in Bali last year with a view to consolidating \r\nin Copenhagen in 2009 a comprehensive agreement for \r\nthe reduction of polluting emissions, in order to avoid \r\nthe worst natural-catastrophe scenarios for a not-so-\r\ndistant future. \r\n The current international scene presents a very \r\ncomplicated structure, characterized by contradictory \r\ntrends of globalization and fragmentation. Indeed, on \r\nthe one hand, we have global integration of production \r\nprocesses, trade, financial flows and technological \r\nrevolution, as well as the dissemination of values such \r\nas democracy and human rights. But, simultaneously, \r\nthere is fragmentation because of increasing social \r\ninequality, poverty, exclusion, proliferation of civil \r\nwars, genocide, terrorism, transnational crime, \r\ndegradation of the environment and the flouting of \r\ninternational law as a means for the peaceful settlement \r\ndisputes.  \r\n Those contradictory trends between globalization \r\nand fragmentation jeopardize the governance of States, \r\nthe governance of the international system and \r\ncollective security itself. Peru, true to its traditional \r\nconstructive approach, considers that the international \r\norder should be based on peace, cooperation, \r\nmultilateralism and, of course, international law. Thus \r\nwe are of the view that at the present time we need to \r\nreaffirm support for the primordial role played by the \r\nUnited Nations in dealing with the major subjects on \r\nthe international agenda, specifically those connected \r\nwith international peace and security, the observance of \r\ndemocratic order, sustainable development, the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights, and \r\nenvironmental protection. \r\n That approach guided Peruvian participation on \r\nthe Security Council and has led it to reaffirm its \r\ncommitment to active participation in peacekeeping \r\noperations in the context of respect for the principles of \r\nthe sovereignty of States and non-intervention in the \r\ndomestic affairs of other countries. Currently, my \r\ncountry’s armed forces are in Haiti, the Sudan, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. Peru has a contingent in the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti and is coordinator of the \r\nGroup of Friends of Haiti, which is responsible for \r\nhelping the Security Council in monitoring this case. \r\n Moreover, Peru is an active participant in \r\nnumerous multilateral mechanisms. This year, we were \r\nhonoured to host the fifth Summit between the \r\nEuropean Union and Latin American and Caribbean \r\nheads of State and Government. Next November, we \r\nwill once again be honoured when we host leaders \r\nfrom the economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic \r\nCooperation Forum at their sixteenth summit.  \r\n As part of our involvement on the international \r\nstage, I should also like to point to our contribution to \r\nthe establishment of the Latin American-Pacific Arc, \r\nwhich aims at harnessing synergies among \r\nparticipating countries in economic and commercial \r\nfields, especially as regards promoting investments in \r\nthe areas of infrastructure and facilitating business, and \r\nin promoting cooperation to improve the \r\ncompetitiveness of our economies. All of that is geared \r\ntowards ensuring a more pronounced and effective \r\npresence for our region in the Asia-Pacific region.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Peru’s \r\ncommitment to continue to support initiatives aimed at \r\npromoting an environment conducive to economic and \r\nsocial development, the full validity of democracy, the \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 8 \r\n \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law and the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights throughout the world. That \r\nshould take place against an international backdrop \r\nwhere conflicts are brought under control, security \r\nprevails and there is unequivocal adherence to the \r\nnorms of international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Those are the central priority goals of \r\nour foreign policy and constitute the guidelines that \r\nwill continue to orient Peru’s participation on the \r\ninternational stage, and especially in this body. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Egypt. \r\n Mr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nsixty-third session of the General Assembly is taking \r\nplace against the backdrop of various international and \r\nregional events and developments that are closely \r\nlinked to the peace and security of all humankind. \r\nAmong those are the global food crisis, the increase in \r\nenergy prices, global warming and climate change and \r\ntheir negative and catastrophic repercussions for the \r\nentire world, the global economic downturn that is \r\nbordering on being a worldwide recession, the sharp \r\nglobal increase in poverty, our diminishing collective \r\nability to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), the rising rate of infection with HIV, malaria \r\nand other deadly diseases, and the fight against \r\nterrorism. Egypt believes that all those challenges, as \r\nwell as others, are high priorities on the international \r\nagenda. Their diagnosis and treatment require a \r\nconcerted international effort. We must all be fully \r\naware that jointly overcoming those problems depends \r\nupon our collective diagnosis and our united stand in \r\naddressing them. \r\n We need a new approach, vision and \r\nmethodology to deal with global problems. \r\nUnfortunately, the existing frameworks have proven \r\nincapable of dealing successfully and effectively with \r\nthe challenges under consideration. As an example, \r\nEgypt believes that the global food and energy crises \r\nrequire serious dialogue between importers and \r\nexporters of energy and food. President Mubarak called \r\nfor such a dialogue at the recent African Union Summit \r\nand at the Rome meeting of the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization (FAO).  \r\n The channels currently available for addressing \r\nand resolving the problems of food and energy are at \r\nodds with each another, to say nothing of the fact that \r\nnone of them can provide for a genuine and meaningful \r\ndialogue between importers and exporters. It was for \r\nthat reason that President Mubarak was keenly \r\ninterested in participating effectively in the emergency \r\nsummit convened by FAO, to which I have referred, on \r\nthe question of the rising price and availability of \r\nfoodstuffs.  \r\n Along the same lines, President Mubarak has \r\nstrongly supported the African endeavour to adopt a \r\nclear strategy to tackle that phenomenon. In turn, that \r\nled to the adoption of the Sharm el-Sheikh declaration \r\nat the last African Union Summit, which contains \r\nAfrica’s comprehensive vision for addressing the \r\nmatter. Egypt has also supported the strategy put \r\nforward by the Secretary-General to deal with the \r\nissue. We have also called for utilizing that strategy as \r\nthe basis for more effective international action. \r\n In an effort to translate the growing international \r\nconcern into an integrated plan of action to address that \r\nphenomenon, Chile, Indonesia and Egypt have \r\nproposed that that question and its repercussions \r\nshould be a main theme at this session of the General \r\nAssembly. In that connection, I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for his positive response to our initiative and \r\nalso for including the issue of strengthening \r\ninternational democratic action at the United Nations. \r\n By the same token, urgently establishing \r\ncollective international political will is necessary to \r\ndeal with climate change. As one of the countries \r\nvulnerable to the repercussions of that phenomenon, \r\nEgypt is acutely aware of its gravity. While reiterating \r\nour full support for the Bali Plan of Action and Road \r\nMap, we call for focused international attention on the \r\nissue of categorizing low-lying coastlines, which \r\napplies to Egypt. A list of the States most vulnerable to \r\nclimate change is needed so the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community can provide them with the \r\nnecessary support as a matter of priority, including \r\ntechnological and financial support. \r\n Based on our belief in globally addressing those \r\nurgent economic challenges, Egypt and Norway are \r\nfacilitating the current negotiations at the United \r\nNations on the final document of the Review \r\nConference on the Implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus on Financing for Development. The goal is \r\nto amend the international development agenda for the \r\nupcoming stage, while taking into consideration the \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n9 08-53122 \r\n \r\nagreements reached in all the international meetings \r\nand conferences held thus far. \r\n Egypt believes that using language that implies \r\ndouble standards is an affront to human rights. Despite \r\nthe fact that everyone is adamant in declaring that \r\nhuman rights constitute an indivisible whole, the \r\nreality, which we need to change, is that economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights are not, unfortunately, \r\naccorded the same attention as civil and political \r\nrights. That adversely affects public perception in \r\nmany of our societies, in particular those that face dire, \r\nand occasionally destructive, economic and living \r\nconditions. For such people, talking incessantly about \r\nhuman rights is a luxury they cannot afford, and results \r\nin the neglect of their basic requirements for \r\nsustenance. The promotion of economic and social \r\nrights must therefore be viewed as crucial to \r\nstrengthening the human rights regime, which is \r\nessential to promoting the awareness and practice of \r\nthe components of that regime. \r\n In that regard, I wish to discuss the important \r\nquestion of using the concept of freedom of expression \r\nto incite hatred based on religion. With the utmost \r\nrespect for the value and importance of freedom of \r\nexpression, I emphasize that we reject repeated affronts \r\nto religions and holy symbols being portrayed as a \r\nlegitimate exercise of freedom of expression: there are \r\nmany glaring slogans in whose name crimes have been \r\ncommitted against thousands and millions of people by \r\noffending them and their religious beliefs. Egypt calls \r\nupon everybody to consider this matter judiciously and \r\nobjectively with a view to striking the proper balance \r\nthat protects freedom of expression while respecting \r\nthe rights and sentiments of all. Egypt will continue to \r\nseek such a balance, with the aim of reaching a \r\nconsensus on the content of draft United Nations \r\nresolutions on this matter. \r\n Here, I wish to convey to the Assembly that we \r\nare concerned by the unconstructive cultural friction \r\nthat the world is witnessing, which causes severe \r\ndivergence in opinion and action; this in turn inflames \r\npublic emotions and increases the nature and severity \r\nof the polarization and confrontation between the \r\nfollowers of different cultures and creeds. This matter \r\nmust not be ignored. \r\n The international community’s approach to \r\ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation is \r\nmarred by defects, double standards and regression. \r\nThis is a matter of concern for us. Egypt has always \r\nshown great interest in these matters, as best embodied \r\nin Egypt’s call to rid the Middle East of all weapons of \r\nmass destruction. Our interest in this matter is based on \r\nour unwavering belief that security and military \r\nbalance, especially in conflict areas, contributes to \r\nlaying solid foundations for peace between countries \r\nand peoples. \r\n However, achieving genuine peace and security \r\nin any region requires, among other things, the \r\nestablishment of just and parallel international and \r\nregional mechanisms in the areas of disarmament, arms \r\ncontrol and non-proliferation. It is notable that, \r\nunfortunately, prominent members of the international \r\ncommunity are unduly lax regarding Israel’s nuclear \r\ncapability and the extent to which this constantly \r\nthreatens the security of the Middle East. This occurs \r\nas attempts are being made to enhance the obligations \r\nincluded in international mechanisms without paying \r\nattention to the issue of achieving the universality of \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons and subjecting all nuclear facilities in the \r\nMiddle East to the comprehensive safeguards system of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. \r\n Egypt will nonetheless persist in its endeavours, \r\nthrough existing mechanisms and forums and in \r\ncoordination with friendly States that understand the \r\nreality and danger of the situation, in order to change it \r\nand to warn of the danger that failing to achieve \r\nuniversality for the NPT in the Middle East would \r\nentail. \r\n In my statement today, I have given precedence \r\nto international over regional issues. This in no way \r\ndiminishes the significance of crises, problems and \r\ndifficulties at the regional level. Rather, it reaffirms the \r\nimportance that Egypt attaches to the international \r\nsituation and international problems in general. \r\n At the regional level, as members know, Egypt is \r\npersistently involved in painstaking efforts to keep \r\nopen a window of hope that would allow the \r\nPalestinians to achieve their legitimate ambition to \r\ngain an independent State on the Palestinian territories \r\noccupied on 5 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital. The current situation, thanks to the efforts of \r\nthe United States, might suggest to some that there is \r\nhope for a real settlement between the Israelis and \r\nPalestinians before the end of the year. However, \r\nthrough diligent monitoring of the situation, we \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 10 \r\n \r\nunderstand that achieving a just and lasting settlement \r\nof the conflict — one that provides an opportunity to \r\nend Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories and to \r\nbring about a Palestinian State — requires serious \r\npolitical will on the part of Israel. This must include \r\nthe dismantlement of settlements in tandem with \r\nwithdrawal from the land, and the restoration of \r\nPalestinian rights. \r\n However, I must admit that we are sceptical about \r\nthe strength of the will and conviction of Israeli \r\ndecision makers. Hence the procrastination and \r\nsetbacks, as well as the hesitation in settling issues. \r\nThis is what leads to the widely condemned and \r\npolitically loaded settlement activities, which clearly \r\nindicate the regression and weakness of the Israeli \r\nside’s will for peace. This is also the reason for the \r\nprolongation of the conflict, with its consequences that \r\nthe whole world knows only too well. But we in Egypt \r\nwill not lose hope; we will continue to work with \r\neveryone in order to achieve the objectives of justice, \r\nstability and security for the whole region. \r\n The situation in the Sudan also remains \r\ndisconcerting in the light of ongoing developments. We \r\nhave observed numerous foreign hands interfering with \r\nSudan’s security and stability, as if their objective were \r\nto drive that country towards partition. In this context, \r\nI would like to affirm that Egypt is working sincerely \r\nwith all loyal Sudanese parties, at the forefront of them \r\nthe Sudanese Government, in order to settle existing \r\nproblems. Allow me to note, in particular, the situation \r\nin Darfur, which remains difficult, and the significant \r\nEgyptian participation in the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping force there, as well as our participation \r\nin all dialogue forums that aim to settle the crisis. I \r\nshould also note our call for an international meeting to \r\naddress the crisis and to agree on a road map to end it. \r\nStability in the Sudan requires outside parties to refrain \r\nfrom interfering in Sudanese affairs, just as it requires \r\nsupport for the development process in that country. \r\nEgypt will continue its diligent efforts to achieve the \r\ninterests of our brothers in the Sudan as well as the \r\ncountry’s and the region’s unity and stability. \r\n In our region, the concept of regional security \r\nshould be construed broadly, and the security of the \r\nArab Gulf — which is currently in the international \r\nspotlight — is one of Egypt’s principal concerns, not \r\nonly because of Egypt’s close relations with the \r\ncountries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), but \r\nalso because of what Egypt represents in terms of \r\nstrategic depth for its Arab brothers and sisters of the \r\nGulf. Therefore, we follow closely all developments in \r\nthe region, in particular the recurrent discourse about \r\n“new arrangements” there. We affirm that Egypt is \r\nworking in coordination with members of the GCC \r\nwith a view to protecting Arab national security and \r\nensuring that any such arrangements — if they come \r\ninto existence — will represent true security guarantees \r\nfor all parties. \r\n A great deal of work lies ahead of us at this \r\nsession. This requires open minds and outstretched \r\nhands in order to meet the demands and aspirations of \r\nour peoples for freedom, justice, dignity, security and \r\npeace. Egypt will work throughout this session to \r\nadvance the components of our vision for the \r\ninternational and regional situation, which I have just \r\nelucidated. \r\n All of us bear the responsibility for this, just as \r\nwe shall all bear the consequences and the results. We \r\npledge to work with dedication and sincerity for a \r\nsuccessful session under your able presidency, Sir. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Moctar Ouane, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Mali.  \r\n Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): It is my \r\ngreat pleasure, Sir, to convey to you the heartfelt \r\ncongratulations of the delegation of Mali upon your \r\nelection to the presidency of the sixty-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly, and to assure you of our full \r\nsupport. I should like also to hail Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his devotion and commitment to our \r\nOrganization. \r\n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \r\nis opening with the timely theme of the impact of the \r\nglobal food crisis on poverty and hunger throughout \r\nthe world. Indeed, it takes place in a difficult \r\ninternational context, one marked by the conjunction of \r\nfood and energy crises. This situation is of concern to \r\nmy delegation, as it is a potential source of generalized \r\nsocial and political instability. \r\n What can we do? In Mali, we have granted the \r\nhighest priority to the fight against poverty and the \r\nhigh cost of living. In this respect, the Government has \r\nundertaken a series of measures to stem the effects of \r\nthe present crisis through, inter alia, a temporary \r\nsuspension of import duties and taxes on basic \r\nfoodstuffs, such as rice, wheat flour, oil and milk, as \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n11 08-53122 \r\n \r\nwell as subsidizing gas, hydrocarbons and agricultural \r\ninputs.  \r\n My country, Mali, is firmly determined to achieve \r\nfood self-sufficiency and to become, in the medium \r\nterm, an agricultural Power. To that end, we have made \r\nagriculture the principal tool to attain accelerated \r\ngrowth. Accordingly, an agricultural framework law \r\nhas been adopted, and its progressive implementation \r\nhas included the following measures. \r\n First and foremost, the new law contains a \r\nmeasure to launch the rice initiative, which was \r\ndesigned as a proactive and structural response to the \r\ndizzying increase in price of grain products on global \r\nmarkets. Next, the law includes the setting up of a \r\nnational agricultural development fund and a fund for \r\nemergencies and disasters. It also involves the setting \r\nup of land commissions and a programme to develop \r\nlow-lying lands within the framework of local \r\nirrigation works. Finally, it involves the setting up of a \r\nhigh council for agriculture. In addition, we will soon \r\nadopt guidelines for the marketing of grain products, \r\nincluding rice, and a mechanism for supplying \r\nagricultural inputs.  \r\n Along these same lines, the Government of Mali \r\nhas prepared and implemented a national strategy to \r\nfight poverty, a strategic framework for fighting \r\npoverty and a strategic framework for growth and \r\npoverty reduction for the period 2007-2011. \r\n In addition, our Social and Economic \r\nDevelopment Project has been conceived by the \r\nPresident of the Republic, Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré. \r\nIt should enable Mali to increase its production and \r\nfairly share the fruits of growth, invest in the future \r\nand build a State of good governance and the rule of \r\nlaw. \r\n The fight against corruption is another aspect of \r\nthis overall project. The national convention that will \r\nbe organized to address this issue in October 2008 \r\nshould enable the Malian nation to seek through broad \r\nconsultation a comprehensive understanding of the \r\nphenomenon in order to define a plan of action against \r\nthe scourge. \r\n Mr. Salgueiro (Portugal), Vice-President, took the \r\n Chair. \r\n Seeking to promote transparent and effective \r\nmanagement of its public finances, Mali, which has \r\njoined the African Union’s African Peer Review \r\nMechanism, has submitted its governance to that \r\nevaluation process. This exercise, which will be \r\nconcluded in January 2009, will take stock of the \r\nsituation, including in the field of political governance, \r\nbusiness governance and governance of socio-\r\neconomic development. It will result in \r\nrecommendations for improvements in those areas. \r\n In the same vein, the human rights situation in \r\nMali has been considered within the framework of the \r\nnew universal periodic review mechanism set up within \r\nthe context of the Human Rights Council. From this \r\nrostrum, laden as it is with symbolism, I would like to \r\nreiterate the commitment of the Government of Mali to \r\ntake concrete action on the relevant recommendations \r\nthat we are committed to following at the outcome of \r\nthis process.  \r\n Mali remains convinced that the prevention and \r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts is the best possible \r\nguarantee of international peace and security. Backed \r\nby that belief, my country firmly made the choice of \r\ndialogue aimed at finding a lasting solution to the \r\nsituation of insecurity that has prevailed in the north-\r\neast of our country. In this respect, the Algiers peace \r\nagreement of 4 July 2006 remains relevant, as it \r\npreserves our territorial integrity and our national \r\nunity, by enabling the various strands of the Malian \r\nnation to fully participate in the national construction \r\nendeavour.  \r\n Aware that security in the Sahelo-Saharan region \r\nis closely linked to that of States and peoples sharing \r\nthe space and that conflicts affecting one country can \r\nrapidly spread throughout the region, the Government \r\nof Mali, in October 2008, will organize in Bamako a \r\nconference on peace, security and development in the \r\nSahelo-Saharan region.  \r\n The conference will provide a useful opportunity \r\nfor the States of the region to jointly reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to turn our shared space into a zone of \r\npeace and security, a centre of stability, growth and \r\ndevelopment. It will also provide us with responses \r\nadapted to the problems and challenges we face: \r\ninsecurity, transborder banditry, terrorism and \r\ntrafficking of all types, including trafficking in drugs, \r\narms and human beings. \r\n Here, Mali considers that it is the duty of the \r\ninternational community to take vigorous action to \r\nmaintain and build international peace and security. In \r\nthis respect, we welcome and encourage progress \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 12 \r\n \r\nachieved in the resolution of conflicts and crises that \r\nrack the African continent, including those in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, the Sudan, Somalia and the Great Lakes \r\nregion.  \r\n Mali calls for the resumption of the negotiating \r\nprocess in the Middle East and reaffirms its \r\nunswerving support for the creation of a sovereign and \r\nindependent Palestinian State. \r\n There are many other serious challenges facing \r\nthe international community to which we will have to \r\nrespond appropriately to build a better world together. \r\nFirst and foremost, there is the problem of climate \r\nchange. Today more than ever before, the very survival \r\nof our planet is threatened by climate change, which \r\nhas a serious impact on living conditions in developing \r\ncountries such as mine through, inter alia, \r\ndesertification, the silting up of rivers, the deterioration \r\nof the environment, a reduction of the length of the \r\nwinter periods, floods and poor rainfall patterns. We \r\nshould, therefore, urgently undertake measures which \r\nare commensurate with the pressing nature of the \r\nproblem. In this respect, the conclusions of the high-\r\nlevel event on climate change in 2007 and those of the \r\nBali Climate Change Conference in the same year are \r\nstill relevant and are worthy of being implemented in a \r\ndiligent way. Mali, which is a party to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, is eager to make a useful contribution to the \r\nfifteenth United Nations Climate Change Conference, \r\nto be held in Copenhagen in December 2009. \r\n The second major challenge to which we must \r\ndevote particular attention is the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \r\nwhich poses one of the most serious threats to \r\nsustainable development. We must redouble our efforts \r\nand our resolve to implement the 2001 Declaration of \r\nCommitment, as well as the outcomes of the high-level \r\nmeetings on AIDS and the seventeenth International \r\nAIDS Conference, held in Mexico last August. All of \r\nthese forums have highlighted the severity of the \r\nsituation and stressed the urgent need to act and to \r\nmobilize resources to fight the pandemic.  \r\n The third significant challenge for the \r\ninternational community is the situation of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, which, as a result of their \r\nisolation and their great distance from the world’s main \r\nmarkets, are confronted with serious handicaps. I \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for having taken the \r\ninitiative to convene, following the general debate, a \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting devoted to the midterm \r\nreview of the Almaty Programme of Action. Mali will \r\nactively participate in that meeting and will work to \r\nensure that leads to operational conclusions that can \r\ncontribute to the comprehensive, rapid, and effective \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n The fourth challenge is institutional reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. This issue remains important as the \r\ncontinuation of the establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Human Rights Council and of the \r\nstrengthening the Economic and Social Council. Thus, \r\nthe expansion of the Security Council is clearly a \r\npressing necessity, particularly to redress the historic \r\ninjustice committed against Africa, namely, that it does \r\nnot have a permanent seat. That is something which is \r\nunderscored in the joint African position on the issue. \r\n All these challenges which we currently face \r\nrequire a collective global response. Only a reformed \r\nand democratized United Nations may serve as a \r\ngenuine crucible for universal collective conscience \r\ncapable of best discharging its primary mission, \r\nnamely, to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war and destruction. Mali will do its full \r\npart in this fight. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Mr. Elmar \r\nMaharram oglu Mammadyarov, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I \r\nhave the honour of congratulating His Excellency \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua on his \r\nelection to the post of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every \r\nsuccess in his endeavours. I would like also to pay \r\ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, for his active collaboration with delegations \r\nthroughout the last session. I wish also to express my \r\nprofound respect for the able leadership demonstrated \r\nby His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in \r\nthe management of the United Nations. \r\n The effectiveness of the international security \r\nsystem has an impact on the authority of the United \r\nNations. When agreement among Security Council \r\nmembers on approaches to overcoming challenges to \r\nworld peace seems elusive, the common security and \r\ncredibility of the United Nations are seriously affected. \r\n We shall respect our shared values and accept the \r\nrestraints inherent in those values in order to find an \r\napproach that is based on a global consensus. The \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n13 08-53122 \r\n \r\nSecurity Council must fully realize its primary \r\nresponsibility for the collective management of threats \r\nthat transcend national boundaries and have \r\nimplications for international security. All of us must \r\nstrictly follow the Charter as a unique instrument of \r\ninternational relations. \r\n The reform of the United Nations and its Security \r\nCouncil will further improve the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations system. The success of the reforms will \r\ndepend on our political willingness to deliver the \r\nexpected results. We need to harmonize diverging \r\nviews in order to arrive at a generally acceptable \r\nsolution that will reflect the universal character of the \r\nUnited Nations and adapt it to present-day realities. \r\n We must enhance the role of the General \r\nAssembly as the supreme policymaking organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is only by strengthening the \r\nAssembly’s mandate that we can successfully tackle \r\nsome of the most pressing issues facing humanity. \r\n This session is taking place at a very critical \r\njuncture for the South Caucasus region and for the \r\ninternational community as a whole. The worrisome \r\nevents that took place last month in Georgia have \r\nclearly shown that restoring stability to the region \r\nrequires a collective effort to strengthen the \r\ninternational security system. \r\n Obviously, the situation in that region is a matter \r\nof concern for us, and Azerbaijan is already making its \r\ncontribution to reduce tensions. We firmly believe that \r\nissues that cause disagreements in the region must be \r\nsettled peacefully, through dialogue, on the basis of the \r\nnorms and principles of international law and mutual \r\nrespect. \r\n The Georgian case has also proved that the \r\nprotracted conflicts existing in the area of Georgia, \r\nUkraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova (GUAM), including \r\nthe Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, \r\nremain a major source of instability, and a fragile \r\nceasefire regime cannot be a substitute for lasting \r\npeace in the region. Persistence of these conflicts \r\nendangers international peace and security and \r\nprevents the full utilization of the potential of this \r\nstrategically important region, situated at the \r\ncrossroads of Europe and Asia. A resolution of the \r\nprotracted conflicts in the GUAM area will not only \r\nbring immediate benefits to affected countries, but will \r\nsubstantially contribute to stability and regional \r\nsecurity. \r\n In that context, the Caucasus Stability and \r\nCooperation Platform initiated by Turkey could serve \r\nas a good departure point for building the regional \r\nsecurity system. It is of utmost importance to ensure \r\nthat our common efforts are built on the principles of \r\nmutual respect for territorial integrity, recognition of \r\nexisting borders, equality and good-neighbourliness. \r\n The prerequisite for the establishment of \r\ncooperation and good-neighbourly relations in the \r\nregion is the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the \r\noccupied lands and the restoration of the full \r\nsovereignty of Azerbaijan over those territories. Only \r\nthrough that can we pave the way for peace and \r\neconomic prosperity for the entire region. \r\n The earliest possible resolution of the armed \r\nconflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region of \r\nAzerbaijan remains a primary task for us. The \r\nGovernment of Azerbaijan is committed to a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the conflict on the basis of the norms and \r\nprinciples of international law, including relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, General Assembly \r\nresolutions and documents of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. \r\n In order to facilitate the negotiation process, \r\nAzerbaijan initiated, during the sixty-second session of \r\nthe General Assembly, consideration of the agenda \r\nitem entitled, “The situation in the occupied territories \r\nof Azerbaijan”. The Assembly comprehensively \r\naddressed the issue and adopted resolution 62/243. We \r\nhighly appreciate the principled support of the States \r\nmembers of the General Assembly for that resolution, \r\nwhich reaffirmed the Assembly’s continued respect and \r\nsupport for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan within its internationally \r\nrecognized borders and demanded the withdrawal of all \r\nArmenian forces from all the occupied territories of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan. The resolution also reaffirmed \r\n“that no State shall recognize as lawful the situation \r\nresulting from the occupation of the territories of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan, nor render aid or assistance in \r\nmaintaining this situation” (resolution 62/243, para. 5). \r\nIt recognized  \r\n“the inalienable right of the population expelled \r\nfrom the occupied territories of the Republic of \r\nAzerbaijan to return to their homes, and \r\nstresse[d] the necessity of creating appropriate \r\nconditions for this return, including the \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 14 \r\n \r\ncomprehensive rehabilitation of the conflict-\r\naffected territories”. (para. 3) \r\n The Assembly  \r\n“[recognized] the necessity of providing normal, \r\nsecure and equal conditions of life for Armenian \r\nand Azerbaijani communities in the Nagorno-\r\nKarabakh region of Azerbaijan, which will allow \r\nan effective democratic system of self-\r\ngovernance to be built up in this region within the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan”. (para. 4) \r\n I would like to stress that the principles laid out \r\nin the resolution will be used as a basis in the \r\nnegotiation process. The General Assembly will \r\ncontinue to follow the situation in the occupied \r\nterritories of Azerbaijan under agenda item 18 of the \r\ncurrent session. \r\n In recent years, Azerbaijan has made crucial \r\ncontributions to strengthening regional stability by \r\npromoting security, energy, communications and \r\neconomic cooperation projects. Production and secure \r\ndelivery of hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea \r\nto international markets has been an important element \r\nof Azerbaijan’s foreign and domestic policy. We will \r\ncontinue to carry out a strategy that will substantially \r\nimprove energy security and economic prospects in the \r\nregion and beyond. \r\n Another strategic project under implementation is \r\nthe construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway \r\nlinking our country with Georgia and Turkey through a \r\nmajor transport connection. This will create an \r\nessentially new and effective communication corridor \r\nbetween East and West, between Europe and Asia. \r\n The economic development and growth of \r\nAzerbaijan have been on the rise. The growth rate of \r\nour gross domestic product remains one of the highest \r\nin the world, and reached 18 per cent in the first nine \r\nmonths of 2008. According to the forecasts of \r\ninternational financial institutions, the growth rate will \r\nretain its dynamics for the next year. \r\n Azerbaijan is of the view that facilitating trade \r\noffers enormous opportunities to pursue development \r\nobjectives. Against this background, the joint report of \r\nthe World Bank and the International Finance \r\nCorporation, “Doing Business 2009”, recognized my \r\ncountry as a top reformer in 2007-2008 in \r\nimplementing business regulatory reforms, and as one \r\nof the leading countries with investment-friendly \r\neconomies. According to the report, out of 181 countries, \r\nAzerbaijan was rated first in improving the commercial \r\nenvironment and encouraging business start-ups. \r\nAzerbaijan strongly believes that these factors are \r\ncentral in attracting and mobilizing financial resources \r\nto support socio-economic development of the country.  \r\n In the meantime, we are champions in the \r\nimplementation of the Extractive Industries \r\nTransparency Initiative (EITI) and consider the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s adoption without a vote of \r\nresolution 62/274, on the EITI, as a sign of the global \r\nrecognition of our efforts. \r\n Protection and promotion of human rights is one \r\nof the central duties of the international community. \r\nToday, this is not merely a question of protecting \r\nindividuals; it is fundamental to promoting peace and \r\nstability around the globe. Azerbaijan remains actively \r\ninvolved in the work of the United Nations human \r\nrights bodies. As a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, we attach great importance to the efficient \r\nfunctioning of the Council. It is our common task and \r\nresponsibility to ensure that that institution lives up to \r\nthe expectations vested in it and truly becomes an \r\nobjective, vigorous and credible universal human rights \r\nbody. \r\n Azerbaijan is fully committed to all its \r\nobligations as a State member of various international \r\norganizations to promote democracy, the rule of law \r\nand human rights. We believe that through consistent \r\nreforms and investments in education, we will achieve \r\nlong-term stability and prosperity in our part of the \r\nworld. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Karel de Gucht, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Belgium. \r\n Mr. de Gucht (Belgium) (spoke in French): \r\nBelgium echoes the congratulations that have been \r\nextended to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session, and wishes him every success. \r\n During the past year, the international community \r\nhas faced unprecedented challenges. As we gather here \r\nin New York, a major crisis of confidence is shaking \r\nthe financial markets. This has an impact, of course, on \r\nthe world economy. The spectre of a global recession \r\nhas been added to the already onerous challenges that \r\nhave arisen in recent times, such as the food crisis, the \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n15 08-53122 \r\n \r\nspike in energy prices, global warming, terrorism and \r\nthe danger of nuclear proliferation. \r\n In addition, our world is changing and becoming \r\nincreasingly multipolar. In that regard, 8 August 2008 \r\nwill remain symbolic: the very day on which China \r\noffered us the unique spectacle of the opening of the \r\nOlympic Games, Russia and Georgia were colliding in \r\na conflict with harmful repercussions for peace on the \r\nEuropean continent. The very foundations of the \r\nbalance that had existed since the 1990s seemed to be \r\ncalled into question. This uncertain situation has far-\r\nreaching consequences for international organizations. \r\n We could imagine that, in the face of these \r\nenormous challenges, all the world’s countries would \r\ncome together to combat them jointly. Unfortunately, \r\nthat is hardly what is happening. Belgium believes that \r\nonly through close cooperation and enhanced \r\nmultilateralism will we be able to respond to these \r\nchallenges. More than ever, whether we like it or not, \r\nwe are in a situation of mutual dependence. Crises \r\naffect all of us, and the actions taken by some have an \r\nimpact on everybody else. That is particularly true for \r\nthe current serious financial crisis. If we can stabilize \r\nthe financial markets in the coming few days through \r\nproactive measures, that will benefit not only the major \r\nbanks and their employees, but also the entrepreneurs, \r\nconsumers and citizens of the whole world, including \r\nthose in the least developed countries. Those countries \r\nhave already been heavily affected by the sharp \r\nincrease in the prices of agricultural and energy \r\nproducts and are the least equipped to deal with a \r\ntightening of credit conditions.  \r\n Stabilizing the markets is certainly necessary, but \r\nit must not make us lose sight of the lessons to be \r\nlearned from the crisis and the corresponding medium- \r\nand long-term measures to be taken to ensure that the \r\nworld does not again become victim to financial \r\nmanagement that at times is risky and immense \r\nspeculation with borrowed money.  \r\n We are well aware that the crisis goes far beyond \r\nthe capacity of a single country, however powerful it \r\nmay be. Better regulation of financial markets and the \r\ndrawing up of control regulations are essential, in \r\nparticular with regard to short selling, hedge funds and \r\nstructured products. That is a task that can be \r\nundertaken only at the international level, in close \r\ncooperation among the world’s economies. \r\n Understand what I am saying: Belgium is \r\nconvinced of the advantages of globalization and free \r\ntrade. We must not forget that thanks to that \r\nglobalization of trade, in recent decades the world has \r\nseen remarkable development and that hundreds of \r\nmillions of men and women have escaped extreme \r\npoverty and today have a better daily life, even if the \r\nsharing of wealth still remains too unequal. \r\n The developed countries have the duty to \r\nspearhead a better organization of the financial world. \r\nThe European Union has already taken steps in that \r\ndirection, and we welcome that. However, there \r\nremains much to do. Here, I make an appeal that we \r\nembark on that task together, with energy and \r\ndedication. \r\n The emergence of new economies is an asset for \r\nthe world. Ever more countries are determined to \r\nbecome players in the international system. They must \r\ntake their due place, as the French President \r\nemphasized last Monday on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (see A/63/PV.5). It is also in everyone’s interest \r\nto demonstrate responsibility. \r\n I would like to stress today that the emerging \r\neconomic Powers, from Brazil to India and from China \r\nto South Africa, have, more than we do and more than \r\never, a need for trade that is both open and fair to \r\ncontinue to develop their economies at the pace they \r\ndeserve, without however causing imbalance in the \r\npillars of international trade. Here too, we must again \r\nfind the constructive political will necessary to restart \r\nthe Doha trade negotiations that unfortunately failed in \r\nGeneva last July. \r\n We all must also show ourselves to be responsible \r\nplayers, in order to try and find solutions to the \r\nchallenges posed by the food crisis and the huge \r\nincrease in energy prices and to combat the causes and \r\neffects of climate change. Those challenges we face, \r\nissues that are extremely complex and closely \r\ninterlinked, are different facets of one and the same \r\nquestion, a question that is at the heart of the concerns \r\nof my country: that of sustainable development. None \r\nof us can resolve these problems alone. They call for \r\nsolutions at the world level. It is thus crucial that we \r\nsuccessfully conclude in December 2009 the \r\nnegotiations for a global agreement on climate, as we \r\npledged in Bali.  \r\n Nor is it by closing in upon ourselves that we \r\nshall reduce the huge inequalities that still characterize \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 16 \r\n \r\nglobal development. Better distribution of the fruits of \r\neconomic growth is a world responsibility that \r\nconcerns us all. The Millennium Development Goals \r\nmust remain our main guiding principle. The Follow-\r\nup International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, which will take place in Doha at \r\nthe end of this year, will be an important moment. The \r\ndeveloped countries must do more, and I reiterate \r\nBelgium’s determination to achieve the objective of \r\ndevoting 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product to \r\nofficial development assistance by 2010.  \r\n However, this is a shared responsibility, which \r\nfirst and foremost falls to the Governments of the \r\ncountries involved. That is why Belgium will continue \r\nto work actively in promoting the concept of good \r\ngovernance. \r\n In that regard, the issue of natural resources is \r\nparticularly important to me. It is not a matter of \r\ncalling into question the sovereignty of any country. \r\nBut sovereignty also carries with it responsibilities — \r\nindeed, responsibilities first and foremost. Natural \r\nresources may be a driving force of development to \r\ndraw populations out of poverty if their exploitation is \r\nundertaken in a transparent way to benefit the economy \r\nof the country. Unfortunately, experience shows that \r\nfrequently that is not the case and that illegal \r\nexploitation often fuels conflict. Therefore, we must \r\nwork towards achieving greater transparency and \r\nfighting illegal exploitation. That is why Belgium \r\norganized last year a debate on that subject in the \r\nSecurity Council (see S/PV.5705), and why it would \r\nlike extensive debate on natural resources during the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. \r\n As a member of the Security Council, Belgium \r\nhas had the opportunity to be at the heart of the \r\ninternational system. That has bolstered our conviction \r\nthat we can meet those great challenges only through \r\nincreased international cooperation and has further \r\nstrengthened our determination to work for effective \r\nmultilateralism. The key to that effectiveness is not to \r\nbe sought only in structures and mechanisms. It lies \r\nalso and above all in our political will to make them \r\nwork and together to find solutions to our common \r\nproblems. \r\n Here, I note with regret a certain turning inwards, \r\neven a return to sovereignty-based concerns. I want to \r\nbe clear: I have great respect for the sovereignty of \r\nStates. That goes without saying. That is one of the \r\nfundamental principles upon which our international \r\nsystem is founded. However, being a sovereign State \r\nalso means that a State must shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities in the international community, even \r\nmore so with regard to its own population. Being a \r\nsovereign State does not mean that it can neglect the \r\nneeds of its citizens in terms of development, security, \r\nthe rule of law and human rights. Sovereignty does not \r\ngive carte blanche for conduct that is incompatible \r\nwith the values and commitments to which we have \r\nsubscribed within the United Nations. Sovereignty \r\nmust be a force for good, and not an excuse for a State \r\nnot to meet its responsibilities and to avoid its \r\ninternational and humanitarian obligations. Otherwise, \r\nit becomes what I would call souverainism: an abuse of \r\nsovereignty behind which to hide and escape its duties. \r\n Too often the argument of respect for sovereignty \r\nprevents the international community from acting when \r\nthe situation in a country is deteriorating before our \r\neyes, resulting in the population suffering and an \r\nincrease in serious human rights violations. The \r\nexamples are well known and strike us all. Myanmar, \r\nDarfur, Zimbabwe and the eastern Congo all confront \r\nus with a responsibility to protect, a responsibility that \r\nthe international community is called upon to exercise \r\nwhen a sovereign State cannot or, worse, refuses to \r\nassume that responsibility. That can be undertaken \r\nthrough humanitarian instruments, the civil \r\nadministration of crises, peacekeeping or peace-\r\nrestoration missions, or, earlier on, crisis prevention. \r\n In that context, I wish to speak of combating \r\nimpunity. Belgium is convinced that there cannot be \r\nlasting peace without justice. That principle guides our \r\nforeign policy. It is achieved in the first place by \r\nbolstering the rule of law and justice at the national \r\nlevel before, during and after a conflict. For the gravest \r\ncrimes, we actively support the development of \r\ninternational criminal law. This is not the time to let \r\nany doubts persist with regard to our active support for \r\nthe International Criminal Court by putting forward, as \r\nsome do, other, more regional solutions. That is \r\nparticularly true now when the Court is preparing its \r\nfirst trial. \r\n Peace and security are the responsibility of the \r\ninternational community as a whole, and it is in that \r\nspirit that Belgium approached its mandate in the \r\nSecurity Council, nearly two years ago: seek \r\nconstantly, in a constructive and non-dogmatic manner, \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n17 08-53122 \r\n \r\nthe best way to move things forward. It is particularly \r\npleased with the progress in crisis management and the \r\nextraordinary expansion of peacekeeping operations. \r\nFrom that perspective Belgium calls for a renewal of \r\nthe United Nations Organization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo with a strengthened \r\nmandate, which is a key factor in maintaining in the \r\neastern Congo the prospects for settling the crisis and \r\navoiding a Somalian scenario.  \r\n Belgium also welcomes efforts of regional \r\norganizations and their collaboration with the United \r\nNations. I am thinking, for instance, of the European \r\nUnion alongside the United Nations in Chad and the \r\nCentral African Republic.  \r\n We need to make further progress with regard to \r\nan integrated and comprehensive approach to conflict \r\nresolution. The establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is a real step forward in that area. That is \r\nwhy Belgium has assumed the chair of the country-\r\nspecific configuration on the Central African Republic. \r\nMajor progress has been made, but much remains to be \r\ndone, in particular in order to better help countries \r\nduring that delicate phase when they are emerging \r\nfrom crisis. \r\n We will soon celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That will \r\nbe the time for us to remember the values that it \r\nrepresents and that we all share, and to which we all \r\nsubscribed and which we should implement for the \r\nbenefit of our citizens and for greater well-being \r\nthroughout the world. It is a responsibility that we must \r\nremember, particularly since it seems to be called into \r\nquestion at a time when we are faced with the major \r\nchallenges that I have just described. Together and on \r\nthe basis of our shared values, we should assume those \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n That is the real challenge. It is not through less, \r\nbut more international cooperation and multilateralism \r\nthat we will achieve solutions. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Walid Al-Moualem, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic. \r\n Mr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): Allow me to congratulate the President and \r\nhis friendly country, Nicaragua, on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. I wish him every success in his mission and \r\nexpress our satisfaction with the message of his \r\nintroductory remarks at the opening of the general \r\ndebate. I would also like to thank his predecessor, \r\nSrgjan Kerim, for successfully steering the work of the \r\nprevious session. I extend to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon our best wishes for success in the realization \r\nof the purposes and principles of the Charter of our \r\ninternational Organization. \r\n The Middle East region is one of the most \r\nvolatile regions of the world, and it continues to face \r\nmounting challenges. Daunting as those challenges \r\nmay be, they must not deter us from moving forward \r\ntowards the light at the end of the tunnel and from \r\nseeking better conditions. Syria is an essential part of \r\nthe solutions sought by the peoples of the region, by \r\nvirtue of its geographic location and the aspirations of \r\nits people.  \r\n For that reason, President Bashar Al-Assad took \r\nthe initiative to convene the Damascus Quartet \r\nSummit, attended by President Sarkozy of France, the \r\nEmir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, and the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip \r\nErdoğan of Turkey. All of those States have a stake in \r\nthe security and stability of the Middle East region. \r\nEach and every one has made constructive \r\ncontributions, despite differing perspectives and \r\npositions. The four leaders probed the issue of peace \r\nand stability in the Middle East and stressed the need \r\nfor consultations and coordination and joint pursuit of \r\nthose objectives. They recognized that inaction, the \r\nsuffering resulting from the Israeli occupation of Arab \r\nterritories that has continued since 1967 and disregard \r\nfor the Palestinian people’s rights have driven the \r\npeople of the region into a state of despair. Under those \r\ncircumstances, attaining a just and comprehensive \r\npeace becomes untenable and the region becomes a \r\nfertile ground for anger and turmoil. In the final \r\nanalysis, that situation does not serve the best interests \r\nof the world or of the countries of the region. \r\n By convening the Quartet Summit, Syria stressed \r\nthat a just and comprehensive peace is its strategic \r\nchoice and that it is striving to attain it in cooperation \r\nwith regional and international partners who share its \r\nvision. The realization of peace requires all of those \r\nwho have a direct stake in the matter, or those who \r\nhave the power or who can influence the outcome, to \r\nevince the necessary political will.  \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 18 \r\n \r\n Years after the will to build peace lost its priority \r\nstatus in the policies that influence the situation in the \r\nregion, we were asked to go to Annapolis. We all went \r\nto Annapolis, despite the ambiguity of the undertaking. \r\nWe wonder what Annapolis achieved. Where exactly \r\ndo we stand? Have the Annapolis promises to establish \r\na Palestinian State before the end of the current year \r\nbeen fulfilled? Has Israel stopped building settlements \r\nin the occupied Arab territories? \r\n Despite all that, given that the withdrawal of \r\nIsrael from our occupied Golan to the line of 4 June \r\n1967 and making peace are Syrian national priorities, \r\nand notwithstanding the circumstances to which I just \r\nreferred, we entered into indirect negotiations with \r\nIsrael, with commendable mediation by Turkey.  \r\n As President Al-Assad said, we wanted the \r\nnegotiations to establish the grounds and pave the way \r\nfor direct negotiations that would ultimately be \r\nsponsored by many international parties. Peacebuilding \r\nrequires, however, genuine Israeli will that is capable \r\nof accommodating the exigencies of peacemaking. It \r\nalso requires the American will to include peace in the \r\nMiddle East on its list of priorities after years of \r\ndeliberately ignoring and dodging the question, which \r\nhas exacerbated the situation in the region. \r\n Syria stresses once again its firm and consistent \r\nsupport for the Palestinian people’s rights to recover \r\ntheir occupied land and establish their independent \r\nState with Jerusalem as its capital. Syria underlines the \r\nneed to restore Palestinian national unity through \r\nnational dialogue and is working towards that end in its \r\ncapacity as the current Chair of the Arab Summit. \r\n The Iraqi situation is a matter of prime concern to \r\nSyria because Iraq is an Arab fraternal country and \r\nbecause, as a neighbouring country, we are affected by \r\nthe negative and positive developments there. We have \r\nalways stressed the need to preserve the unity of the \r\npeople of Iraq, its territorial integrity, non-interference \r\nin its internal affairs and the need to preserve its \r\nsovereignty, independence, its Arab and Islamic \r\nidentity, and to oppose the calls to divide it. We have \r\nrepeatedly declared that the solution in Iraq begins \r\nwith national reconciliation built on the principle of \r\nrespect for the will of all Iraqis. We have reiterated the \r\nneed for foreign troops to withdraw from Iraq in line \r\nwith agreements reached with the Iraqi Government. \r\nWe have always condemned all terrorist acts \r\ncommitted in Iraq, resulting in the deaths of many \r\ninnocent civilians. We believe that the stability that \r\nIraq longs for requires an Iraqi consensus to overcome \r\nthe obstacles barring its realization. \r\n It is regrettable that the abnormal circumstances \r\nthat prevailed in Iraq as a result of the United States \r\ninvasion in 2003 have prompted a great number of \r\nIraqis to leave their country in pursuit of safety and \r\nsecurity. Syria hosts many Iraqi brothers and sisters. \r\nTherefore, we are deeply aware of the humanitarian \r\ncrisis that has forced Iraqis from their country and \r\nexacerbated the situation in their country. We hope that \r\nan improved security situation will permit all Iraqis to \r\nreturn to Iraq. \r\n We in Syria are pleased that the situation in \r\nLebanon is being resolved after the conclusion of the \r\nDoha Agreement, which enabled the Lebanese to elect \r\na consensual President, establish a Government of \r\nnational unity and initiate a national dialogue. Despite \r\nunfounded claims to the contrary, we have consistently \r\nsupported all measures that could assist the Lebanese \r\nin arriving at consensual solutions built on dialogue \r\nand the affirmation of national unity. During the recent \r\nvisit of the Lebanese President Michel Sleiman to \r\nSyria, we declared that we had jointly decided to \r\nestablish diplomatic relations between our two \r\ncountries with a view to maintaining and supporting \r\nmutual, deep and wide-ranging relations and interests \r\nbetween our two fraternal peoples. We also agreed to \r\nresume the work of the joint Lebanese-Syrian border \r\ndemarcation commission in accordance with \r\nmechanisms and priorities to be agreed upon by the \r\ntwo parties. The two countries also agreed to entrust to \r\ntheir respective authorities the task of continuing to \r\nwork together to control their common borders, fight \r\nsmuggling, undertake the necessary measures to \r\npromote trade, create the conditions for economic \r\nintegration and establish a common economic market. \r\n Syria supports efforts aimed at guaranteeing the \r\nSudan’s unity and territorial integrity and promoting \r\npeace and stability in that country. In that context, we \r\nare completely opposed to the decision of the \r\nProsecutor of the International Criminal Court and call \r\non the Security Council to suspend it with a view to \r\ncreating favourable conditions for pursuing the \r\ninitiative endorsed by the Council of Ministers of the \r\nLeague of Arab States on 9 August 2008. The initiative \r\ncalled for establishing an Arab ministerial committee \r\nunder the chairmanship of Qatar and entrusting it with \r\noverseeing comprehensive peace talks between the \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n19 08-53122 \r\n \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the armed groups in \r\nDarfur. The committee would sponsor those \r\nnegotiations in cooperation and coordination with the \r\ninternational mediator of the African Union and a \r\nUnited Nations representative. It would also seek to \r\nimprove the humanitarian situation and to promote \r\ndevelopment in Darfur.  \r\n Syria, a member of the committee, calls on all \r\nStates concerned and on the international community to \r\nsupport the committee in its efforts to fulfil its \r\nmandate. In that regard, Syria welcomes the \r\nnormalization of relations between the Sudan and Chad \r\nas a positive contribution to the solution of the Darfur \r\nquestion. \r\n The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) guarantees the right of all States to \r\npossess nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes. \r\nMuch has been said about the Iranian nuclear issue, \r\nwith some advocating a diplomatic solution while \r\nothers promote the use of force. Meanwhile, Iran has \r\ntime and again stressed that it is solely dedicated to the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear power. Deep mistrust between \r\nIran and its interlocutors complicates matters and \r\nprevents the stakeholders from reaching an \r\nunderstanding. We seek a political understanding of the \r\nIranian nuclear issue. Any other option is not in the \r\ninterests of any of the stakeholders and will only inflict \r\ncatastrophic losses on the region and the world. \r\n In that context, and in line with our principled \r\nposition, we call for declaring the Middle East a zone \r\nfree from all weapons of mass destruction. Similarly, \r\nwe recall the draft resolution that Syria submitted to \r\nthe Security Council on 29 October 2003. At the same \r\ntime, we stress the need to compel Israel to dismantle \r\nthe hundreds of nuclear warheads in its possession, to \r\nsubmit its nuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency and to accede \r\nto the NPT. \r\n The crisis that erupted in the Caucasus region \r\nwas an extremely ominous event. It is impossible to \r\nignore its dimensions and repercussions on \r\ninternational relations. By now, we know who sowed \r\nits seeds and are aware of the provocative acts \r\nassociated with it, prompting Russia to exercise the \r\noption it chose. We appreciate Russia’s positive \r\nresponse to the efforts of France in its capacity as \r\nPresident of the European Union to arrive at a \r\nsettlement of the crisis that will guarantee regional \r\nstability and spare the world a revival of the \r\ninternational relations that prevailed in the past. \r\n Much has been said about the war on terror. Years \r\nafter waging that war, some issues still prompt us to \r\nask: Is terrorism less widespread today than it was \r\nbefore? Can we claim to have prevailed over that \r\nextremely dangerous phenomenon? Accusing countries \r\nof sponsoring terrorism for ulterior political motives is \r\na desperate attempt by those promoting those claims to \r\njustify the failure of their approach.  \r\n The right approach requires us to address the root \r\ncauses of terrorism. How can we overcome terrorism if \r\nwe continue to conflate terrorism with the right of the \r\nindividual to live on his land, free from occupation or \r\nthreat of war and aggression? We call upon all States to \r\ncooperate in the fight against terrorism. We particularly \r\nstress the need to avoid confusing terrorism with \r\nfundamental rights, because doing so gives terrorism \r\nan opportunity to strike. \r\n Experience demonstrates that unilaterally \r\ndictating the world’s political agenda is wrong. The \r\nwars and the financial and food crises raging \r\nthroughout the world today require us to work together \r\nto address that malfunction by seeking to engage all \r\nregional and international stakeholders through active \r\ndiplomacy and dialogue as the means to settle \r\ncontroversial questions. \r\n Closing the door to dialogue and imposing \r\nisolation, unilateral sanctions and diktats have never \r\nbeen successful tools in the exercise of sound \r\ninternational relations. Contrary to claims made from \r\nthis very rostrum a couple of days ago, all attempts at \r\nisolation are doomed to failure. Respect for the \r\nprinciple of democracy in international relations that \r\ntakes into account the vision and interests of all States, \r\nlarge and small, will contribute to the realization of \r\nsecurity and stability in the world and help it solve the \r\nproblems it faces.  \r\n The Charter of our international Organization, in \r\nwhich States of different perspectives and interests \r\nenjoy equal membership, has set forth formulas that \r\nremain valid and could be used to build a world in \r\nwhich justice reigns supreme, based on mutual \r\nunderstanding — a world free from the threat of terror \r\nand in which there is no place for inciting hatred \r\namong cultures and religions. Promoting those values, \r\nprinciples and objectives and using them as guidelines \r\nfor our work will serve the interests of peace and \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 20 \r\n \r\nstability in the world and contribute to the good of \r\nhumanity at large. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sayyid Badr bin Hamad AlBusaidi, \r\nSecretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Sultanate of Oman. \r\n Mr. AlBusaidi (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\nthe honour to convey the regards of His Majesty Sultan \r\nQaboos Bin Said of Oman, and his best wishes and \r\nappreciation for the efforts to make this session a \r\nsuccess. \r\n I am quite hopeful that this session will yield a \r\ngreat deal of understanding on various issues of \r\ncommon interest that shall enhance global security and \r\nstability in accordance with the aspirations of the \r\npeople of the world to achieve prosperity and realize \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n I would also like to seize this opportunity to \r\nexpress my appreciation to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his commendable efforts to improve the \r\nperformance of this Organization in the interests of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n In that connection, we would like to emphasize \r\nthe role of international institutions and the need to \r\nsupport their efforts by intensifying cooperation and \r\ncoordination with them in order to uphold justice and \r\nrighteousness and to entrench security, peace and \r\nstability throughout the world. \r\n Annual sessions of the General Assembly are \r\nimportant events through which Member States have \r\nthe opportunity to express their concerns and views. \r\nThere is no doubt that the efforts to preserve the \r\nenvironment have remained a top international priority, \r\nparticularly in view of developments in recent years, \r\nduring which the effects of climate change have been \r\nfelt across the world. \r\n The international community has made numerous \r\nefforts in that respect, the most salient of which \r\nincludes Agenda 21, adopted at the 1992 United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development \r\nin Brazil, and the Bali Road Map adopted at the 2007 \r\nConference to the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nIndonesia. Those efforts are designed to deepen \r\nunderstanding and awareness of climate change and to \r\nimprove weather forecasting in order to save lives and \r\nproperty, to discourage human practices that are \r\ndetrimental to the environment and to educate people \r\nto live in harmony with it.  \r\n More than ever before, however, we are called \r\nupon to intensify and double our efforts and joint \r\ncooperation in order to deal with such circumstances in \r\na constructive and practical way. We must support \r\npurposeful scientific research aimed at finding creative \r\nmeans, policies and plans to guarantee a stable and \r\nsustainable environment while taking into account \r\nphysical evidence related to climatic cycles and \r\nenvironmental change through the ages. We hope that \r\nthe fourteenth climate change Conference, to be held in \r\nCopenhagen next year, will produce practical and \r\nuseful recommendations that meet our hopes and \r\naspirations. \r\n Economic development and trade among nations \r\nhave helped build bridges of communication based on \r\nmutual benefits and common interests. The current \r\ntrade system, however, is in dire need of a vision and \r\nsystems that keep pace with economic transformations \r\nand with emerging economic entities in order to \r\nmaintain the balance of the global economy and to \r\ncater to the needs of developing countries. \r\n Large industrial countries need to lift trade \r\nrestrictions on the exports of developing countries and \r\nto share with them modern technologies, effective \r\nmarketing mechanisms, and educational and scientific \r\nframeworks that guarantee meaningful human \r\ndevelopment everywhere. The World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) should play a more effective role \r\ntowards the removal of trade restrictions and the \r\napplication of appropriate policies so as to create a \r\nfreer trade environment. \r\n While we welcome the invitation by the Director-\r\nGeneral of the WTO, Mr. Pascal Lamy, to hold another \r\nround of trade negotiations in the context of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda, we would like to emphasize that \r\nsuch negotiations should rely on WTO rules that are \r\nrooted in equity and justice. \r\n Everyone knows that the Palestinians are \r\nsuffering the repercussions of tragic human \r\ncircumstances that have deprived them of their right to \r\na life of dignity. The harsh Israeli policies of closures, \r\nthe erection of checkpoints and the perpetuation of \r\nsettlement activities make the daily lives of \r\nPalestinians very difficult. Those practices also \r\nundermine efforts and initiatives to achieve peace and \r\nstability. Indeed, they call into question the credibility \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n21 08-53122 \r\n \r\nof Israel’s desire to seek a real solution to end the \r\nconflict. \r\n We urge the international community to step up \r\nits efforts to make Israel shoulder its responsibilities, in \r\nview of the importance and inevitability of peace as the \r\nonly option for joint and harmonious coexistence \r\nbetween all peoples of the region. It has become clear \r\nthat there can be no peace without the restoration of the \r\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost of \r\nwhich is their right to live safely on their land and in \r\ntheir independent State, side by side with Israel and \r\nwithin internationally recognized boundaries. \r\n Our commitment to peace is strategic and \r\nfundamental. Ensuring peace is a collective \r\nresponsibility of the international community that \r\nshould be forcefully and selflessly shouldered, \r\nregardless of the difficulties encountered. On that \r\nbasis, the Sultanate of Oman, in the context of its \r\nfriendly relations and cooperation with many countries, \r\nis ever eager to promote long-term relations as a \r\nfundamental pillar of joint efforts in support of peace, \r\nsecurity, dialogue, mutual understanding and harmony. \r\n The progress made towards Lebanese \r\nreconciliation is an achievement that invites optimism. \r\nWhile we praise the efforts made by the State of Qatar \r\nand all other Arab States, as well as by the League of \r\nArab States, we call upon all Lebanese parties to \r\nimplement the Doha Agreement in order to safeguard \r\nthe higher interests of the brotherly Lebanese people. \r\nWe also welcome the visit to Syria by Lebanese \r\nPresident Michel Sleiman and its positive outcome, \r\nincluding the agreement to establish diplomatic ties \r\nbetween the two countries. \r\n With regard to the situation in Iraq, we note with \r\nsatisfaction the relative improvements in the country’s \r\nsecurity conditions. We hope that the situation will \r\ncontinue to improve until stability prevails throughout \r\nIraq. We also hope for continued efforts by the Iraqi \r\nGovernment and all political forces to reach a \r\ncomprehensive national understanding that can unite \r\nall sectors of Iraqi society and restore harmony and \r\nconcord to its national and social fabric. \r\n As for the situation in the Sudanese region of \r\nDarfur, we welcome the steps being taken by the \r\nSudanese Government, in cooperation with the African \r\nUnion and the League of Arab States, to establish \r\npeace and stability in the region. We therefore call \r\nupon the international community to support those \r\nefforts in order to help build a national consensus \r\namong all brotherly Sudanese citizens. \r\n From this rostrum, we reiterate our call to all \r\nSomali parties to cease fighting and to refrain from any \r\nactions that could hamper sound diplomatic efforts. We \r\nalso hope that all parties will abide by the agreement \r\nreached in Djibouti on 9 June 2008. \r\n In addition, we call for continued consultations \r\nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and other States \r\non the Iranian nuclear issue. We hope that those efforts \r\nwill result in an agreement that upholds Iran’s right to \r\nuse nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, while \r\neliminating the concerns of a number of States \r\nregarding the Iranian nuclear programme. \r\n The Games of the XXIX Olympiad, hosted by the \r\nfriendly People’s Republic of China in Beijing, were \r\nunique in terms of their organization, which definitely \r\nmade that international sports event a great success. \r\nThe Games have enriched human civilization in all of \r\nits beautiful cultural diversity. We wish to take this \r\nopportunity to express our best wishes for the next \r\nOlympic Games, which will be hosted by the United \r\nKingdom in London in 2012, as well as our hope that \r\nthey will continue to contribute to human and cultural \r\ncoexistence among all nations. \r\n The progress that has already been made in the \r\nfield of collaborative international endeavours \r\nencourages us to make further collective efforts to \r\naddress the challenges facing us and to protect the \r\npeoples of the world from their political, economic and \r\nsocial repercussions. We also wish to emphasize the \r\nimportance of a joint commitment to the establishment \r\nof justice and the rule of law. Governments must \r\nshoulder their responsibilities in a spirit of positive \r\ncooperation, understanding and mutual respect, which \r\nare basic principles of international peace and security. \r\n In closing, I wish the President of the General \r\nAssembly the best of luck in leading the present \r\nsession to a successful conclusion. I should like to \r\nreaffirm the support of the Sultanate of Oman for \r\nefforts to ensure the welfare of all nations and future \r\ngenerations. We hope that all of this will be achieved in \r\nan atmosphere of cooperation, harmony and love. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Marat Tazhin, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 22 \r\n \r\n Mr. Tazhin (Kazakhstan): First of all, I would \r\nlike to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly on his election to his high office and to \r\nexpress my confidence that, under his able \r\nstewardship, the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly will be fruitful and successful. \r\n When Christopher Columbus reached the shores \r\nof America in 1492, he believed that he had discovered \r\na new route to India. Today we know that, many years \r\nbefore Columbus made that voyage, European \r\nexplorers had reached Saint Lawrence Bay. Obviously, \r\nprior to the so-called discovery of America, developed \r\ncivilizations had already existed there. At the same \r\ntime, Columbus did discover America in a certain \r\nsense, because it radically altered the understanding of \r\nworld geography. \r\n It is globalization that is giving us a new vision \r\nof the world in the twenty-first century. While offering \r\nnew opportunities to the world economy and human \r\ndevelopment, globalization is also triggering a new \r\nsurge of political and economic competition \r\nworldwide. \r\n We can now see clearly that it is imperative to \r\nprevent the interests of peoples and countries from \r\nbeing sacrificed for the sake of that competition. Given \r\nrecent complications and disputes, it is urgent that we \r\npreserve the basic principles of international law, \r\nincluding that of territorial integrity. It is crucial that \r\nwe avoid double standards in the application of that \r\nprinciple. \r\n Despite the efforts being undertaken, the world is \r\nnot becoming a safer place. We must admit that there is \r\nstill no international consensus regarding the issues of \r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. As everyone knows, history could \r\nrepeat itself if we do not learn its lessons properly. \r\nTherefore, nuclear disarmament and an enhanced \r\nnon-proliferation regime should become a priority for \r\nall, without any conditionalities.  \r\n Kazakhstan, a country that voluntarily \r\nrelinquished the fourth-largest nuclear arsenal in the \r\nworld, believes that it is absolutely imperative to \r\ndevelop new mechanisms for adapting the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to new \r\nrealities. We call on Member States to finalize the \r\nnecessary procedures for the entry into force of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the \r\nstrengthening of its verification mechanism. That is \r\nprecisely the purpose of the integrated on-site \r\ninspection field exercise currently being conducted in \r\nour country at the former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing \r\nground. \r\n The crisis of the non-proliferation regime poses \r\nthe real threat that nuclear weapons will fall into the \r\nhands of terrorists. Kazakhstan is actively participating \r\nin the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism \r\nand in that regard hosted this year the Atom anti-terror \r\nexercises and an international conference on the \r\nphysical protection of nuclear material.  \r\n The situation in Afghanistan remains a matter of \r\ngrave concern. In our opinion, the way to normalize the \r\nsituation is to build up the international community’s \r\nefforts for the peaceful reconstruction of Afghanistan. \r\nTo that end, the Government of my county has adopted \r\na special plan on assistance to Afghanistan. \r\n Kazakhstan is committed to timely and effective \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). We have already reached a number of targets \r\nin several areas, including poverty reduction, access to \r\neducation and the empowerment of women. Now we \r\nare embarking on the MDG-Plus targets, adapted to our \r\nnational conditions, in order to set up higher \r\nbenchmarks and indicators. \r\n Like many other countries, Kazakhstan is deeply \r\nconcerned about the situation regarding the global food \r\nmarket. We share the view of the majority that an \r\nintegrated approach is required to overcome the current \r\nfood crisis. \r\n Today the international community faces the \r\nchallenge of a global rise in basic food prices. \r\nKazakhstan, as a major producer and exporter of grain \r\ncrops and flour, is prepared to make a substantial \r\ncontribution to overcoming the food crisis. As of \r\n1 September 2008, we have lifted our ban on grain \r\nexports. That is our contribution to the international \r\ncommunity’s collective efforts to curb global grain \r\nprices. \r\n Because of the critical importance of energy \r\nresources, preserving the global energy balance has \r\nbecome a more urgent imperative. Kazakhstan fully \r\nunderstands its ever-increasing role and responsibility \r\nas a reliable energy supplier.  \r\n Bearing in mind that energy and environmental \r\nproblems are closely interconnected, I would like to \r\nonce again draw attention to the initiatives set forth by \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n23 08-53122 \r\n \r\nthe President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, \r\nfrom this rostrum a year ago (see A/62/PV.4). They call \r\nfor adoption of a Eurasian pact on the stability of \r\nenergy supplies, as well as development of a global \r\nenergy and environment strategy within the United \r\nNations framework. \r\n Kazakhstan attaches critical importance to \r\nproblems associated with climate change and \r\nsustainable development. To ensure the convergence of \r\nthe European and Asian processes of transition to \r\nsustainable development and their merging into a \r\nsingle Eurasian process, Kazakhstan has put forward an \r\ninitiative on convening in 2010 a conference of \r\nministers of environment, economy and social welfare \r\nof the Asian and Pacific countries and a pan-European \r\nconference on the environment for Europe in 2011. \r\n We would like to express our profound \r\nappreciation to the entire international community, the \r\nUnited Nations and its agencies and programmes for \r\nthe support they rendered to our country in mitigating \r\nthe consequences of environmental disasters in the Aral \r\nSea and Semipalatinsk regions. Calling for continued \r\nactive international cooperation, we request support for \r\nthe draft resolutions to be submitted at the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly concerning the \r\nproblems of the Semipalatinsk region and granting the \r\nInternational Fund to Save the Aral Sea observer status \r\nat the General Assembly. \r\n The growing number of natural and man-made \r\ndisasters makes it necessary to intensify international \r\ncooperation as the most effective means of responding \r\nto emergencies. Kazakhstan supports cooperation in \r\nsetting up national and regional platforms, exemplified \r\nby the Central Asian Disaster Response Coordination \r\nCentre. \r\n We strongly believe that the special needs of \r\nlandlocked countries should be fully taken into account \r\nin accordance with decisions and recommendations \r\nbased on the Almaty Programme of Action. We hope \r\nthat the forthcoming midterm review of the Programme \r\nwill result in the adoption of specific decisions on \r\nassistance to this group of countries. \r\n Escalation of ethno-territorial conflicts and \r\nincreased interfaith tensions indicate that we have \r\nreached a critical turning point in our common history. \r\nUnder these circumstances, Kazakhstan has been \r\nconsistently and proactively pursuing a policy aimed at \r\nensuring inter-ethnic and interfaith accord, as well as \r\npreserving political and social stability in our society. \r\nUpon the initiative of our head of State, President \r\nNazarbayev, the Kazakh capital, Astana, hosted two \r\nCongresses of Leaders of World and Traditional \r\nReligions, in 2003 and 2006. With its next summit \r\nmeeting to be convened in 2009, this forum has already \r\nproved to be an effective international mechanism for \r\npromoting peace and tolerance on a global scale. \r\n Kazakhstan is actively involved in the work of \r\nthe Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations. \r\nOur initiative to declare 2010 the International Year of \r\nthe Rapprochement of Cultures has been supported by \r\nall Member States, as reflected in resolution 62/90. We \r\nappeal to all countries and organizations of the United \r\nNations to prepare relevant plans for the attainment of \r\nthe goals of the International Year, in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of that resolution. \r\n Taking further practical steps to promote dialogue \r\namong civilizations, Kazakhstan has proposed the \r\nconvening of a ministerial conference to be entitled \r\n“Common world: Progress through diversity”. Foreign \r\nministers from different regions of the planet have \r\nbeen invited to attend the first meeting of that forum, \r\nwhich is to be held in Astana in October. \r\n As Kazakhstan prepares to assume the duties of \r\nChair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe in 2010 and of the Ministerial Conference of \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference in 2011, we \r\nintend to use this unique opportunity to promote the \r\nissues of ensuring greater tolerance and furthering \r\nmeasures by member States against all forms of \r\ndiscrimination as serious items in those organizations. \r\n I would like to conclude my remarks with some \r\nancient oriental wisdom: “Between a man that digs a \r\nhole and the man that fills it, there should always be a \r\nthird man ready to plant a tree”. In today’s world, the \r\nUnited Nations performs that vital function by \r\nfostering dialogue and cooperation among all peoples \r\nand all States. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mourad Medelci, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Algeria. \r\n Mr. Medelci (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): I wish \r\nat the outset to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also pay \r\nwell-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 24 \r\n \r\nKerim, and thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nthe dignified, far-sighted and able manner in which he \r\nhas carried out his heavy responsibilities since his \r\nelection. \r\n The central theme of this session and the subjects \r\nchosen for two high-level events are a perfect \r\nreflection of the international community’s current \r\nconcerns. In recent months, the world has experienced \r\ncrises that have revealed our collective vulnerability \r\nand our inability to confront those crises. As always, \r\nsince the world order is based on that imbalance, the \r\ndeveloping countries in particular pay the highest price \r\nby being powerless to meet the challenges that threaten \r\ntheir political stability and social cohesion.  \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n In that regard, the consequences of climate \r\nchange and the food crisis caused by the scarcity and \r\nsoaring prices of certain basic commodities have \r\nplunged millions of people into extreme poverty. \r\nInternational financial and economic institutions, \r\nwhose mission it is to anticipate crises and alert the \r\ninternational community to their potential risk, must \r\nplay their proper role by undertaking the needed \r\nreforms without requiring developing countries, in \r\nparticular African countries, to abide by commitments \r\nincompatible with their development goals.  \r\n We must effectively and resolutely combat \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We stress \r\nonce again the importance and urgency of adopting a \r\ncomprehensive counter-terrorism convention, while \r\navoiding any provisions or stipulations that would \r\nprejudice the legitimate struggle of people to reclaim \r\ntheir freedom or of discrediting any particular religious \r\ncommunity.  \r\n It is indispensable to continue the work of \r\nreforming the Organization so that it can become an \r\ninstrument to promote freedom, democracy, justice, \r\npeace, security, development and progress. Such \r\nreform will be fruitful and promising only if it includes \r\nreform of the Security Council through the equitable \r\nexpansion of its membership, the democratization of its \r\ndecision-making processes and the improvement of its \r\nworking methods.  \r\n Algeria’s actions in the geographical and political \r\nspheres to which it belongs are based on the principles \r\nof good-neighbourliness, cooperation and solidarity. In \r\nthe Arab Maghreb, Algeria is working to ease the \r\ndifficulties we are experiencing, which have hindered \r\nthe re-launching of the Arab Maghreb Union, in the \r\nconviction that the destiny of our peoples and the \r\nrequirements of our times demand the advent of a \r\nunited and prosperous Maghreb. We are, however, keen \r\nto ensure that efforts in that regard do not meet with \r\nnew disappointments, and we therefore think that that \r\nre-launching must be undertaken on a sound, solid and \r\nlasting basis that takes into account the enlightened \r\nself-interest of all the peoples of the region. \r\n Inspired by its faith in that ideal of the Maghreb, \r\nAlgeria has sincerely supported and will continue to \r\nsupport efforts to find a just, lasting and internationally \r\nlegitimate solution to the conflict in Western Sahara \r\nthat will allow the Saharawi people to exercise freely \r\nand transparently their inalienable right to self-\r\ndetermination. That is why Algeria believes it vital that \r\nthe momentum created by the Manhasset process be \r\npreserved and encouraged. We cannot overstress the \r\nresponsibility of all the parties. We have made an \r\nurgent appeal to the Secretary-General to participate in \r\nactions to remove obstacles to the negotiating process \r\nand to bring about conditions that will permit the \r\nholding of the fifth round of the process as soon as \r\npossible, as required by the relevant resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council. Algeria, for its part, will continue to \r\nassume fully the role dictated by its status as a \r\nneighbourly country and an observer of the process. \r\n On the Middle East, Algeria is pleased to note the \r\npositive developments in Lebanon and encourages all \r\nparties to persevere on the path of unity and national \r\nreconciliation. It is obvious that the Middle East will \r\nknow no peace without a settlement of the Palestinian \r\nquestion, which is at the core of the Israeli-Arab \r\nconflict. There is no need for me to remind the \r\nAssembly that the advent of a just, comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace in the Middle East will inevitably require \r\nrestoring to the Palestinian people their national and \r\nhistoric rights, including their right to an independent \r\nState, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, the return \r\nof refugees and the restoration of all the other Arab \r\nterritories occupied by Israel. On that basis, we appeal \r\nto the international community to fully shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities towards the Palestinian people, to \r\nsupport their just cause politically and to step up its \r\nhumanitarian assistance in order to ease their suffering.  \r\n The African continent has been experiencing \r\nprofound and promising changes. Undeniably, it is in \r\nthe field of peace that the continent’s achievements \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n25 08-53122 \r\n \r\nhave been the most remarkable. Thus, the African \r\nUnion and other regional organizations have become \r\nrespected and necessary partners, particularly in \r\npreventing and settling African crises. Algeria \r\nwelcomes these positive trends. We regret, however, \r\nthat the support and commitment of Africa’s partners \r\nremain below the agreed objectives, both with respect \r\nto restoring peace and to economic and social \r\ndevelopment programmes.  \r\n We believe it is of the greatest importance to \r\nrefrain from any action likely to thwart current peace \r\nefforts or to undermine the unity, territorial integrity \r\nand sovereignty of the Sudan. We must therefore \r\nmobilize the international community to promote the \r\npolitical process, which remains the only way to ensure \r\nthat the Sudanese people can benefit from the \r\nrestoration of peace and national reconciliation. In that \r\nregard, we reiterate our support for the efforts and \r\nproposals of the League of Arab States, the African \r\nUnion, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, calling on the Security \r\nCouncil to freeze the decision of the Chief Prosecutor \r\nof the International Criminal Court and to promote and \r\nconsolidate the dynamics of peace and national \r\nreconciliation.  \r\n Similarly, with regard to the situation in \r\nZimbabwe, Algeria can only welcome the approach \r\nadopted by the African Union and the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community to enable the people of \r\nZimbabwe to overcome their current difficulties.  \r\n We are solidly behind Africa’s efforts to settle the \r\nSomali crisis by means of unreserved support for the \r\npolitical process and the dispatch of a peace mission to \r\nhelp the transitional authorities to restore peace and \r\nsecurity in the country.  \r\n There is no way to overcome the dangers to peace \r\nand harmony in the world other than concerted efforts \r\nand consultations on the basis of a renewed equitable \r\nand effective multilateral system that places the \r\nnon-discriminatory fulfilment of human needs and the \r\npreservation of human dignity at the heart of its \r\nconcerns. From that standpoint, the fight against all the \r\nills that afflict large swathes of humankind — whether \r\nextreme poverty, endemic disease, environmental \r\nproblems or clandestine immigration — can be won \r\nonly if we all, and in particular the developed \r\ncountries, join our efforts. The two high-level meetings \r\nduring this session, and others to be held over the next \r\nfew months will undeniably test our capacity to \r\nrespond collectively and solidly to the challenges of \r\nour time. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed \r\nAl-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain. \r\n Shaikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMay I, at the outset, convey my heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession and assure you of the commitment of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain and its delegation to working \r\nclosely with you towards achieving our shared \r\nobjectives. I have no doubt that your experience and \r\nabilities will play a crucial role in ensuring the success \r\nof this session. I also want to take this opportunity to \r\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for his \r\nleadership of the General Assembly at its previous \r\nsession and to express our continued and deep \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nongoing, unflinching dedication and initiative in \r\naddressing the many challenges facing the United \r\nNations and the world. \r\n These General Assembly meetings provide a \r\nvaluable opportunity for all of us in the international \r\ncommunity to reflect on the challenges, problems and \r\nissues facing us all in order to form a more \r\ncomprehensive view of the issues, to understand their \r\ncauses, be it through success or failure, and to work \r\ntogether to develop a shared vision of the future and \r\nthe tools necessary to achieve our aims and realize our \r\nvision. \r\n Today, the international community faces many \r\nchallenges in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), notably those related to energy, the \r\nenvironment, natural disasters, food shortages, \r\neducation and the financial crisis that has recently \r\nshaken the world. These challenges make achieving the \r\nMDGs difficult for many States, to a degree that affects \r\ntheir economic development and increases the rate of \r\npoverty in them. We therefore need an urgent and \r\neffective response from the international community to \r\ndeal with those pressing issues in order to achieve the \r\nMDGs. Yet, as we review our progress to date, the \r\nglobal effort to achieve the Goals has been uneven, at \r\nbest, to the point that we are today on the verge of a \r\ndevelopment emergency. \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 26 \r\n \r\n The Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the \r\nopportunities provided by the high-level event on the \r\nMDGs, held on 25 September, and the high-level meeting \r\non Africa’s development needs, held on 22 September, to \r\nrenew the commitments of all States. \r\n In addressing these important issues, we must not \r\nlose sight of the impact of disasters, both natural and \r\nman-made, in holding back progress towards achieving \r\nthe MDGs. It is thus imperative that States integrate \r\ndisaster risk reduction into their development plans. \r\nWe simply cannot afford to ignore or delay these \r\ndevelopment issues. Nor can we dismiss them as soft \r\nissues, for if action is not taken soon, they will become \r\nreal threats to global security and prosperity. The \r\nKingdom of Bahrain therefore fully supports the \r\nGlobal Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \r\nand plans to host the launch of the report in May 2009. \r\n As we all know, the issue of climate change is of \r\nutmost importance. As the world prepares to meet to \r\nnegotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol by the end \r\nof 2009, global demand for energy is rising fast, as \r\npopulations increase and some developing countries \r\nundergo dramatic economic growth. The International \r\nEnergy Agency predicts that the world’s energy needs \r\ncould increase by 50 per cent by 2030. We therefore \r\nlook forward to the meeting to be held in Poland later \r\nthis year in advance of the United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference to be held in Copenhagen in 2009. \r\nWe are hopeful that all sides will realize the \r\nimportance of the climate change issue and will \r\ncommit themselves to addressing the overriding \r\ninterests of the future of our planet and of future \r\ngenerations. Our hope is that a comprehensive and \r\neffective agreement can be concluded and \r\nimplemented. \r\n The peaceful use of nuclear energy has become a \r\npreferred option for many countries, and here the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain therefore shares the concerns of \r\nthe international community. Therefore, future \r\nagreements on the use of nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes must be made within a strengthened  \r\nnon-proliferation regime, with improved safeguards \r\nand an expanded verification mechanism, in order to \r\nensure that our peoples are not put at risk. Indeed, a \r\nhighlight of the twenty-eighth Supreme Council of the \r\nGulf Cooperation Council, held last December in \r\nDoha, was the acknowledgment of the right of \r\ncountries of the region to seek nuclear expertise and to \r\npossess nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in close \r\ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency. \r\n Given its universal impact and implications, \r\nenergy and its various sources are in need of a holistic, \r\nglobal approach, yet they are dealt with in a \r\nfragmented, piecemeal manner. That unsatisfactory \r\nsituation leads us to suggest the establishment of a \r\ntruly comprehensive energy organization. Such an \r\norganization would bring a joint international \r\nperspective to determining the role and usage of \r\nhydrocarbons, nuclear power, new and renewable \r\nenergy sources, and would introduce innovative \r\nsolutions to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. Such a body could provide accurate \r\nassessments of global energy demand and supply and \r\nbring energy data under one roof. It would also provide \r\nany objective advice that might be required on an \r\noptimal energy mix that is both safe and \r\nenvironmentally sound. \r\n Having spoken of energy and climate change \r\nissues, I must now turn to the food security crisis, \r\nwhich is a result of high food prices and which in 2007 \r\nincreased the number of hungry people in the world by \r\nabout 50 million. We believe that the solution to that \r\ncrisis lies in working together to implement solutions, \r\nsuch as reducing biofuel production, changing \r\nconsumption habits and investing in sustainable \r\nagricultural methods. \r\n The shock that has recently affected the \r\ninternational financial system has almost resulted in a \r\nglobal economic catastrophe. That shock has revealed \r\nthe weaknesses and fragility of the current financial \r\nsystem and its propensity for rapid and widespread \r\ndislocation. We bear the historic responsibility to \r\nestablish transparent new regulations based on the \r\ninterests of all States Members of the United Nations \r\nand to prepare a framework that can contain any future \r\nfinancial crisis. \r\n The fact is that multilateral cooperation is \r\nfundamental to addressing these challenges, as no \r\ncountry alone can resolve such issues and crises or \r\nisolate itself from their consequences. As the \r\nSecretary-General said in his opening statement, \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n“Nations can no longer protect their interests or \r\nadvance the well-being of their peoples without \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n27 08-53122 \r\n \r\nthe partnership of other nations.” (A/63/PV.5, \r\np. 1). \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n The Kingdom of Bahrain therefore supports \r\nefforts to reform, renew and reinvigorate the \r\ninternational Organization and its organs to be more \r\nresponsive to the needs of a new world. We agree with \r\nthe view of the Secretary-General, set out in his annual \r\nreport (A/63/1), that we need a stronger, more effective \r\nand more modern Organization. We look forward to the \r\nstructural reform of this international Organization to \r\nenable it respond more effectively to the challenges \r\nfaced by the international community and to increase \r\nits capacity to deal with such issues. \r\n We must make every effort to address such \r\nshortcomings as threats to the international security \r\nsystem emanating from a wide range of external sources, \r\nincluding extremists, terrorists, drug traffickers, money \r\nlaunderers and intellectual property pirates. We need to \r\ndevelop collective security arrangements that bring \r\ntogether our security efforts while ensuring respect for \r\nexisting borders between States and avoiding \r\nencroachment on their sovereignty.  \r\n On the issue of terrorism, we consider terrorism \r\nto have many faces — whether in the form of the \r\nheinous crime perpetrated in Islamabad a few days ago \r\nthat led to the deaths of scores of innocent people, or \r\nagitation and incitement from afar or a variety of other \r\nmanifestations. We should be clear and decisive in \r\nconfronting terrorism in a comprehensive manner so as \r\nto defeat it both in the field and ideologically. We \r\nbelieve that the struggle against terrorism is a battle \r\nthat we should wage, united, if we are to get rid of its \r\nevil. \r\n The Middle East faces many acute issues in \r\ndesperate need of settlement, the most pressing of \r\nwhich is the need for a just, comprehensive, lasting and \r\npeaceful settlement of the Palestinian question based \r\non ensuring security for all the peoples of the Middle \r\nEast region, including Israel. Such a settlement must \r\ntake place within the framework of international \r\nlegitimacy and the relevant terms of reference, where \r\nthe choice will be just peace, as called for in the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative.  \r\n In that regard, there is also an urgent need for a \r\npeaceful settlement on the Syrian track, including \r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Arab Syrian Golan and \r\nthe remaining Lebanese territories. It also requires a \r\nhalt to Israeli incursions into Lebanon, whose stability \r\nmust be supported. It is also important to have a \r\nresolution of the issue of the occupied islands of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, either through direct \r\nnegotiations or by referring the issue to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. That would be a \r\nsignificant step towards strengthening trust between \r\nthe countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran.  \r\n The Gulf region, which is an integral part of the \r\nworld economy, has experienced destructive wars \r\nduring the past three decades. It will not be able to \r\nendure a new war, due to the severe consequences on \r\nthe world economy. The Kingdom of Bahrain therefore \r\nreiterates its call for a peaceful solution to the Iranian \r\nnuclear issue, in order to avoid the scourge of war in \r\nthe region and to enhance world peace and stability.  \r\n Moreover, there is an urgent need to rid the \r\nMiddle East and the Gulf region of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, while \r\nsafeguarding the rights of all countries to the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy in accordance with the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency. \r\n In order for the Middle East to enjoy stable and \r\nlasting peace, it is incumbent upon us to re-evaluate \r\nour outlook on the region and to consider the \r\npossibility of developing new regional frameworks to \r\naddress and overcome long-standing challenges. Now \r\nis the time, for example, to consider the establishment \r\nof an organization that would include all States of the \r\nMiddle East, without exception, to discuss long-\r\nstanding issues openly and frankly, in the hope of \r\nreaching a stable and durable understanding between \r\nall parties. As Arabs, we accept peace as a strategic \r\noption. We are committed to international legitimacy, \r\nending old conflicts and hostilities and beginning a \r\nnew chapter for a historic rapprochement between the \r\npeoples of the region that will lead towards a better \r\nfuture characterized by understanding, stability and \r\nprosperity. \r\n Developments in the Kingdom of Bahrain in \r\nrecent years have been characterized by dialogue and \r\nunderstanding, a process inaugurated by our leader, His \r\nMajesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, as part of his \r\nextensive reform programme that aims at strengthening \r\ndemocracy, political reform and the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. At a time when we will \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 28 \r\n \r\nsoon join the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity in commemorating the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which \r\nlaid down the principles and values of freedom and \r\nhuman justice for modern times, Bahrain’s election to \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the adoption at Geneva \r\nin June of the report on our first universal periodic \r\nreview serve to clearly illustrate the international \r\ncommunity’s recognition of Bahrain’s efforts in the \r\narea of human rights. \r\n The Kingdom of Bahrain will continue to move \r\nforward in that and other fields, for example, by \r\nestablishing Bahrain’s national human rights institution \r\nand continuing to make progress in the political, \r\neconomic and regulatory spheres. The Kingdom of \r\nBahrain will not hesitate to play its role in helping \r\nbrotherly and friendly States and in sharing its success \r\nstories, which have helped provide a better life for our \r\npeople. In that regard, His Highness Shaikh Khalifa bin \r\nSalman Al-Khalifa, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nBahrain, in cooperation with the United Nations \r\nHuman Settlements Programme, has sponsored an \r\naward called the Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa \r\nHabitat Award, which honours distinguished research \r\nthat contributes to alleviating poverty and safeguarding \r\nthe environment and recognizes the efforts of States to \r\nachieve desired economic development. His Highness \r\nis expected to present the award this year during the \r\nfourth session of the World Urban Forum, which is to \r\nbe held in Nanjing, in the People’s Republic of China. \r\n A key pillar of Bahrain’s approach to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) continues to \r\nbe its investment in modern education that is practical, \r\nrelevant and of high quality and that instils critical \r\nthinking and creativity and encourages innovation and \r\nacceptance of the other. In that respect, I want to note \r\nthat Bahrain has been able to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in the area of education \r\nsignificantly before the 2015 deadline. We have done \r\nso by providing children with free high-quality \r\neducation and by making basic education for all a \r\nfundamental human right. \r\n In conclusion, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the “land \r\nof immortality” and proud host of many civilizations, \r\nis a country where the concepts of tolerance and \r\ncoexistence among all segments of society are central. \r\nMosques stand alongside churches and temples of \r\nvarious denominations, and people enjoy freedom and \r\nreligious tolerance irrespective of their religion or \r\nethnicity. Fraternal values, moderation and the \r\nrejection of violence and terrorism are embedded in our \r\nculture, auguring a promising new era in the history of \r\nhumankind.  \r\n That is the Kingdom of Bahrain that is committed \r\nto participating fully, along with the rest of the \r\ninternational community, in achieving global peace, \r\nstability and prosperity and to confronting current and \r\nfuture challenges, for the benefit of our peoples and \r\nfuture generations. That is a task the international \r\ncommunity must undertake in a spirit of cooperation \r\nand good faith, for when future generations evaluate \r\nour actions and hold us to account, they will not \r\nforgive our mistakes and miscalculations. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Omar A. Touray, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of the Gambia. \r\n Mr. Touray (Gambia): I bring to everyone here \r\ngreetings from His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. \r\nJammeh, President and head of State of the Republic of \r\nthe Gambia.  \r\n The legitimacy of multilateralism, which lies at \r\nthe core of the United Nations system, is being \r\nincreasingly questioned. Yes, with the launching of the \r\nformer Secretary-General’s report “In larger freedom: \r\ntowards development, security and human rights for \r\nall” (A/59/2005), a lot of reforms have taken place and \r\nare still taking place. However, the question is, “Is it \r\nenough?” One of the unassailable conclusions reached \r\nin that report is that “no reform of the United Nations \r\nwould be complete without reform of the Security \r\nCouncil” (A/59/2005, para. 169). We have established \r\na new Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and have undertaken far-reaching \r\nmanagement reforms, yet the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is still being unnecessarily stalled for no \r\njustifiable reason. That delay constitutes a source of \r\nfrustration for the citizens of this world, who are \r\nincreasingly questioning the legitimacy of our \r\ndecisions. The world is watching the unsatisfactory \r\nstatus quo with dismay.  \r\n In any event, the aspirations of the African people \r\nand their Governments to adequate representation on \r\nthe Council cannot be ignored because they are \r\nlegitimate and justified. The suggestion that reforming \r\nthe Council’s working methods alone could constitute \r\nsufficient reform is not accurate. \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n29 08-53122 \r\n \r\n My delegation has taken note of the High-level \r\nPanel’s report and the Secretary-General’s comment on \r\nUnited Nations system-wide coherence, as well as the \r\nconcept paper on institutional options to strengthen \r\nUnited Nations work on gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women. My delegation aligns itself \r\nwith the position of the Group of 77 and China on that \r\nwork in progress. \r\n Our world is also going through a period of \r\ncrises, ranging from the food crisis and the energy \r\ncrisis to the collapse of financial markets and the \r\ncollapse of trade talks. There is no country on Earth \r\nthat is not affected by those crises. Too many repetitive \r\nhigh-level meetings, too many false promises and \r\nunfulfilled commitments continue to characterize our \r\nefforts to address the global crises. We in the \r\ndeveloping world have received too many prescriptions \r\nfrom the international community and we have \r\nfastidiously followed them. The irony, however, \r\nremains that our partners are not fulfilling their side of \r\nthe bargain in the way they should. It is our hope that \r\nthe upcoming Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development to Review the \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be \r\nheld in Doha this November, will result in the reversal \r\nof that trend. \r\n We are asked to eliminate subsidies while our \r\npartners in the North continue to give huge subsidies to \r\ntheir farmers. We are opening up our markets while \r\nthey continue to introduce subtle measures including \r\ntariff and non-tariff barriers to deny us effective market \r\naccess. They commit to doubling overseas \r\ndevelopment assistance, but turn around and withhold \r\nthe little that trickles in. When it trickles in, it becomes \r\na media event. That is no way to end poverty. That is \r\nno way to end the food crisis. That is no way to end the \r\nenergy crisis. Certainly, that is no way to address \r\nclimate change, and it is no way to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n Allow me to share some thoughts about the \r\nglobal food crisis. When the crisis struck earlier this \r\nyear, no economy was spared. The food crisis was \r\npredictable because the international community over \r\nthe past decade has neglected agriculture in the \r\ndeveloping countries. In most developing countries, \r\nagricultural research and training institutions \r\ncollapsed, largely because of underfunding. Research \r\nand development were outsourced to multinational \r\ncorporations. Most of us in the developing world saw \r\nthe collapse of our agriculture markets through \r\ncompetition from the heavily subsidized farmers of the \r\ndeveloped world. World trade talks keep on failing, to \r\nthe detriment of poor farmers in rural Africa and \r\nelsewhere in the developing world. \r\n Our response to the food crisis followed the usual \r\npattern of convening conferences and meetings and \r\nadopting blueprints that merely heal the symptoms. We \r\nneed more than that. How many times have we met in \r\nRome and elsewhere just to adopt the same \r\ncommitments that we have already adopted over the \r\nyears? Our farmers need agricultural inputs, such as \r\nmachinery and fertilizers, to enhance their production \r\ncapacity. We all know what is at stake. Let us honour \r\nour commitments in order not to repeat the dramatic \r\nevents that stem from food shortages.  \r\n As we address the food crisis, we cannot \r\nunderestimate the impact of skyrocketing energy costs \r\non the incomes and livelihoods of our populations. Our \r\neconomies are under enormous stress and our gains in \r\neconomic growth and development are at risk of being \r\ncompletely eroded. We appreciate the efforts that a \r\nnumber of energy-producing countries are making to \r\nease the impact of the crisis on net importing countries. \r\nOur delegation believes, however, that sustained efforts \r\nshould continue to be made to stabilize the oil market. \r\nBeyond tackling the economic crisis that is impacting \r\nthe world, we should also pay attention to the question \r\nof conflict resolution in various conflict areas. \r\n One of the cornerstones of the Gambia’s foreign \r\npolicy is the pursuit of peace and security. As a peace-\r\nloving people, it is our constant desire to contribute to \r\nthe search for lasting peace wherever there is conflict. \r\nIt is for those reasons that the Gambia actively \r\nparticipates in peace missions and promotes good-\r\nneighbourliness, friendship and cooperation throughout \r\nAfrica and beyond.  \r\n I must register my satisfaction at the peace \r\ndividend that is being reaped today across Africa \r\nthanks to the commitment of African leaders to finding \r\nsolutions to African conflicts. We are witnessing the \r\nresurgence of hope in Sierra Leone and Liberia after \r\nmany years of consolidation of peace and security. It is \r\nmy delegation’s fervent hope that the international \r\ncommunity will not relent in extending to them all the \r\nfinancial, technical and material support they require to \r\nturn their societies around for the better. \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 30 \r\n \r\n The Gambian delegation fully shares the agony of \r\nthe Somali Government and people over the \r\nbreakdown of law and order and the internal conflict \r\nthat continues to plague that country. In that regard, I \r\nwish to salute the effort that the Government and the \r\npeople of Ethiopia, the neighbouring countries and the \r\nAfrican Union are making in trying to bring peace and \r\nsecurity to Somalia.  \r\n It is the strong desire of my delegation to see a \r\npeaceful settlement of the conflict in Darfur. As a \r\ntroop-contributing country to the African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, we humbly call on \r\nall the parties to iron out their differences at the \r\nnegotiating table. Regarding the threat to indict \r\nPresident Al-Bashir of the Sudan, the Gambia wishes \r\nto register its full support for the position taken on the \r\nmatter by the African Union, the League of Arab States \r\nand the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The people of the Middle East are tired of living \r\nin a theatre of conflict. The Palestinian conflict has \r\nlingered for too long and the condition of ordinary \r\nPalestinians continues to deteriorate even after \r\nnumerous accords and promises. General Assembly \r\nresolutions, Security Council resolutions and even the \r\nrecent International Court of Justice advisory opinion \r\non the situation are not being implemented. The \r\nQuartet and the international community seem \r\nhelpless. We must ask ourselves: “How do we respond \r\nto the despair and lack of action that seem to \r\ncharacterize the peace agenda of the United Nations in \r\nthat region? When will the two-State solution be \r\nachieved?” Unless we do something to break the \r\nlogjam in the ongoing negotiations, lasting peace will \r\nremain elusive. \r\n Iraq and Afghanistan continue to roil in conflict. \r\nThe international community must give the \r\nGovernments of those countries space to make \r\ndecisions that are in the best interests of their peoples.  \r\n Allow me now to address some neglected issues \r\nof international justice. My delegation has always \r\naddressed the question of Taiwan in this Assembly \r\nfrom the point of view of justice, fairness and equality. \r\nTaiwan is a stable and prosperous democracy that is \r\nwilling and able to take part in the work that the \r\nOrganization does. How can one justify the exclusion \r\nof Taiwan from actively participating in the activities \r\nof United Nations agencies? Safeguarding the welfare \r\nof the 23 million Taiwanese through their participation \r\nshould be accepted under the principle of universality. \r\nFor example, although it has the world’s tenth largest \r\nshipping capacity, Taiwan does not have access to the \r\nInternational Maritime Organization. That adversely \r\naffects the progress of its shipping industry.  \r\n Furthermore, as the world’s eighth largest \r\neconomy and twentieth largest foreign investor, Taiwan \r\npossesses significant economic strength and continues \r\nto share its development experiences with many \r\ndeveloping countries through technical and \r\nhumanitarian assistance. Taiwan is supporting the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand other internationally agreed development goals. I \r\ntherefore strongly believe that we should all agree to \r\nlet Taiwan participate in the activities of the \r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. That is a \r\nmodest request that my delegation fervently hopes \r\nmerits the Assembly’s objective consideration. \r\n The perpetuation of the unjust extraterritorial \r\neconomic embargo against Cuba has never made sense, \r\ndoes not make sense today and has no place in our \r\ncommunity of nations. Its sole objective is to inflict \r\nunnecessary harm and suffering on a resolute people. \r\nThe General Assembly’s persistent calls for its \r\nabolition have only met with indifference. At their hour \r\nof need, when hurricanes Ike and Gustav inflicted \r\nmassive damage on the country, Cuba’s humanitarian \r\ncall for the lifting of the embargo to enable it to \r\npurchase necessary humanitarian supplies has met with \r\nnothing but a cold response. There is no room for such \r\naction in the twenty-first century. The embargo must \r\nend. \r\n I would like to address a number of social issues \r\nthat are very high on the global agenda. In Africa, we \r\nare committed to combating the scourges of \r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious \r\ndiseases. Over the years, African Governments have \r\ncommitted substantial resources to fighting those \r\ndiseases. Yet, our health-care delivery systems remain \r\nunder serious stress because of the flight of trained \r\nprofessionals to more advanced countries. That is \r\nconsidered to be positive migration, but we are being \r\ndevastated by it. I think some serious dialogue needs to \r\nbegin between our countries and beneficiary States on \r\nhow to get fair compensation for such huge losses. \r\n The other side of migration is what some call \r\n“illegal” migration, especially from Africa to Europe. \r\nIt is a question that is tied to the problem of youth \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n31 08-53122 \r\n \r\nunemployment in our societies and to the broader \r\nquestion of development. Over the years, we have tried \r\nto address the migration conundrum at various forums, \r\nbut we need to come up with solutions that empower \r\nyoung people through job creation, skills and \r\nvocational training programmes in order to stem the \r\ntide. Governments must manage migration humanely. \r\nThe human rights and welfare of migrants and their \r\nfamilies should be upheld by all societies. My \r\ndelegation would like to appeal to all Governments to \r\ndo more to stamp out the increasing rise of intolerance, \r\nxenophobia and racism directed against migrants and \r\ntheir families. \r\n Ours is a world of considerable opportunities and \r\nchallenges. Let us collectively exploit the opportunities \r\noffered by our globalized world to tackle the \r\nchallenges that face humankind. Together, we can do it. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab \r\nEmirates. \r\n Sheikh Al Nahyan (United Arab Emirates) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): On behalf of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, I have the pleasure to express to you, \r\nMr. President, and to your friendly country our sincere \r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. I would \r\nalso like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, \r\nfor successfully guiding the proceedings of the \r\nprevious session. I should also take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-\r\nmoon for his unceasing efforts to strengthen the \r\nOrganization and re-energize its role in international \r\naffairs. \r\n The United Arab Emirates has made major \r\nprogress in a number of domestic areas. For example, \r\nwe have increased the representation of women in our \r\nexecutive and legislative bodies, including by \r\nexpanding their effective participation in the labour \r\nmarket. We are developing national laws on the \r\nprotection of and respect for human rights and are \r\nmaking significant efforts to improve the welfare of \r\nthose with special needs. Attempts are also under way \r\nto enact legislation to regulate foreign workers in order \r\nto ensure their full rights. In keeping with our \r\ncommitments under relevant bilateral and international \r\nagreements, we are also increasing our efforts to \r\ncombat human trafficking and to provide protection \r\nand all the necessary support for its victims. \r\n With regard to the environment, the United Arab \r\nEmirates attaches great importance to environmental \r\nissues. In cooperation with the Worldwide Fund for \r\nNature, we have launched a number of ambitious \r\nstrategic programmes, such as the development of \r\nMasdar City, which will be the world’s first carbon- \r\nand waste-free city, completely dependent on \r\nrenewable and clean technologies such as solar energy, \r\nwhich will be used to generate power and desalinate of \r\nwater. \r\n Foreign aid has an important place on our \r\nnational agenda. We have continued to provide various \r\ntypes of financial and humanitarian assistance to many \r\ncountries to help them to fund their development \r\nprogrammes and infrastructure projects. Directly and \r\nthrough our membership in the United Nations Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Donor \r\nSupport Group and our contributions to the specialized \r\nagencies and programmes of the United Nations, we \r\nare also providing assistance to those who have \r\nsuffered from wars and natural disasters. \r\n In order to alleviate the suffering of millions of \r\npeople as a result of rising food prices, my country has \r\ndispatched 2 million tons of wheat to Yemen, Syria and \r\nEgypt. Also as part of our foreign aid, we have \r\nprovided additional financial assistance to help several \r\ndeveloping countries adjust to the phenomenal increase \r\nin their energy costs. \r\n In that regard, we would like to express our \r\nconcern about the repercussions of the financial crisis \r\nin international markets. We reiterate that this matter \r\nurgently calls for a joint international mechanism that \r\nwill contribute to the establishment of strong and \r\ntransparent rules to regulate international financial \r\nmarkets.  \r\n The way in which development has taken place in \r\nthe United Arab Emirates provides a vivid example of \r\ntolerance and coexistence. We hope to enrich and \r\nstrengthen those values through our educational and \r\ncultural programmes, for we strongly believe that \r\ninteraction between different nations and peoples is \r\nboth of fundamental importance and an essential \r\nprerequisite for the achievement of stability, welfare \r\nand prosperity in our region.  \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 32 \r\n \r\n The United Arab Emirates therefore attaches \r\ngreat importance to radically restructuring and \r\nmodernizing our educational system to align it with \r\ntechnological and educational innovations so that it \r\nmeets the needs and requirements of our development \r\nprogrammes. We also believe that providing education \r\nfor all is one of the major and significant issues facing \r\nus. It is essential that we devote all our resources to it, \r\nfor in education lies the hope that we can break the evil \r\ncycle of poverty and ignorance, which in turn lead to \r\nthe creation of a fertile environment in which terrorism \r\nand extremism can take root and grow. \r\n Iran’s ongoing occupation since 1971 of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates’` three islands of Abu Musa and \r\nGreater and Lesser Tunb is an issue of central \r\nimportance to us. From this rostrum, I would like to \r\nreiterate our firm position demanding the full \r\nrestoration of our full sovereignty over the three \r\noccupied islands and their territorial waters, airspace, \r\ncontinental shelf and exclusive economic zone. The \r\nislands are part and parcel of our national sovereignty. \r\nWe reiterate that all actions and measures, whether \r\nmilitary or administrative, undertaken by Iran since its \r\noccupation of the three islands are null and void. Iran’s \r\nactions have no legal effect. We therefore renew our \r\ncall to the international community to urge Iran to \r\nrespond positively to the sincere appeals of the United \r\nArab Emirates, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the \r\nLeague of Arab States by agreeing to resolve the issue \r\nthrough committed and serious direct negotiations or \r\nby referring the dispute to the International Court of \r\nJustice. \r\n We strongly believe in making the Middle East, \r\nincluding the Arabian Gulf, a zone free from weapons \r\nof mass destruction. That would require compelling \r\nIsrael to comply with United Nations resolutions by \r\nbringing its nuclear facilities into compliance with the \r\nsafeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) and unconditionally signing the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as other \r\ncountries of the region have done. We also urge the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to continue its cooperation \r\nwith the IAEA and the international community in \r\norder to dispel fears and suspicions related to the \r\nnature and objectives of its nuclear programme. We \r\nalso call on all other stakeholders to commit \r\nthemselves to continuing to address that issue through \r\npolitical and diplomatic means in order to avoid \r\nescalation and achieve a peaceful solution that can \r\nensure stability and security for the region and its \r\npeoples. \r\n Based on our firm belief in the right of countries \r\nto develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in \r\naccordance with the safeguards regime of the IAEA, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates urges developed nations to \r\nsupport the legitimate needs of developing countries \r\nfor access to nuclear energy by providing them with \r\nthe best possible access to the equipment, nuclear \r\nmaterials and technological and scientific know-how \r\nrelated to peaceful purposes. The United Arab Emirates \r\nbelieves that its peaceful nuclear programme provides \r\na practical and responsible example of transparency in \r\nmeeting our energy needs, while at the same time we \r\npledge not to engage in enrichment or reprocessing, \r\nwith the support of the organizations and institutions of \r\nsome friendly countries and under the supervision of \r\nthe IAEA. \r\n On another front, the United Arab Emirates has \r\ncontinuously spared no effort to support and promote \r\nevery regional and international effort to help the \r\nGovernment of Iraq and its people. It is our hope that \r\nthe latest initiatives of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nincluding the write-off of more than $7 billion in debt \r\nand interest due and the re-opening of our embassy in \r\nBaghdad, will contribute to promoting economic \r\ndevelopment and strengthening the political process. \r\nThat will require the renunciation of all communal and \r\nsectarian violence and full commitment to the unity, \r\nsovereignty and stability of Iraq, the preservation of its \r\nArab identity and the rejection of any attempts to \r\ndivide or fragment the country. \r\n With regard to the Middle East, the United Arab \r\nEmirates has strongly supported the Palestinian-Israeli \r\npeace process, including final status negotiations and \r\nthe outcome of the Annapolis Conference. In that \r\ncontext, we would like to express our concerns about \r\nthe lack of earnest in Israel’s attitude towards those \r\nnegotiations. We call on the international community, \r\nand in particular the Security Council and the members \r\nof the Quartet, to press Israel to lift the siege it has \r\nimposed on the Palestinian people and to implement \r\ninternational resolutions related to freezing all of its \r\nillegal settlement activity, dismantling unlawful \r\nsettlements and ending its occupation of all Palestinian \r\nand Arab territories occupied since 1967, including the \r\nholy city of Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and some \r\nLebanese territories. Ending the occupation would \r\nbring Israel into compliance with relevant international \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n33 08-53122 \r\n \r\nresolutions, the road map and the Arab peace initiative. \r\nIt would also ensure the establishment of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, as well as Israel’s security. \r\n My country has cooperated effectively and \r\nconsistently with every effort to combat terrorism in all \r\nits forms and manifestations, including money-\r\nlaundering. We shall continue to do so in order to rid \r\nthe world of that scourge and its causes. At the same \r\ntime, we re-emphasize our support for all activities to \r\npromote dialogue among civilizations and enhance the \r\nspirit of tolerance among all faiths. \r\n In closing, I would like to stress the need for full \r\ncompliance with the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law in meeting the daunting challenges \r\nahead. I hope that this session will produce \r\ninternational consensus on how to address those \r\nchallenges for the benefit of humankind.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Lazǎr Comǎnescu, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Romania.  \r\n Mr. Comǎnescu (Romania) (spoke in French): \r\nRomania fully associates itself with the statement made \r\non behalf of the European Union by President Nicolas \r\nSarkozy. I should simply like to make a few remarks \r\nwith regard to issues of particular interest to my \r\nGovernment. I should like to frame my statement \r\naround two words: responsibility and solidarity. \r\n The basic purpose of the high-level meeting that \r\ntook place on 25 September was to review the progress \r\nmade in the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and evaluate the feasibility of \r\nachieving them. It was a matter not of whether they \r\nwere appropriate or reasonable, which they obviously \r\nare, but rather of determining the viability of \r\nimplementing them in the face of new challenges. The \r\nconclusion was that international cooperation and \r\ndetermination could provide a solution, provided that \r\nresponsibilities were met and solidarity forthcoming. In \r\ndoing so, we would be making the idea of community \r\nconcrete. \r\n With regard to climate change, the world energy \r\ncrisis and food security, I should simply like to say that \r\nthe vulnerability of nature is inevitably linked to our \r\nincreased technological capacity to influence the \r\nclimate — sometimes irreversibly — through the \r\ncumulative effects of human activity; hence the moral \r\nimperative of responsibility to the future. We cannot \r\nseparately or individually find solutions to the \r\nproblems that affect us all, in particular global \r\nwarming and the energy crisis. \r\n In the face of all those interconnected challenges, \r\nit is our responsibility to better equip the United \r\nNations with the necessary means to coordinate \r\neffective joint efforts. The revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, system-wide coherence, Security Council \r\nreform and, not least, the reform of the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs are all areas in which we have a \r\nresponsibility to make significant progress. It is \r\nencouraging that there has been an effort to find \r\ncommon denominators in many projects and initiatives. \r\n Any reform of the Security Council must take \r\ninto account the legitimate aspirations of the regional \r\ngroups, with the ultimate goal of ensuring a more \r\nrepresentative, legitimate, transparent and effective \r\nCouncil. \r\n If we expect results from the United Nations, we \r\nmust provide it with the appropriate resources. \r\nFollowing the reform of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations, it is only logical to \r\nstrengthen the capacity for analysis, political \r\nmediation, foresight and preventive diplomacy of the \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs. My country is ready \r\nonce again support the initiative for institutional \r\nconsolidation, in particular as regards a European \r\nregional office charged with expanding its reach to the \r\nWestern Balkans and the Black Sea region.  \r\n United Nations regional political offices could \r\nalso increase their cooperation with regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, whose resources should be \r\nin synergy with those of the global Organization. The \r\ncooperation between the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion and other subregional organizations during the \r\nrecent crises in the Darfur region of the Sudan, in \r\nKenya and in Zimbabwe are all encouraging examples. \r\nWe also welcome the ongoing cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie. \r\n I should now like to say a few words on \r\ndemocratization. Romania welcomes the substantial \r\nexpansion and improvement of cooperation in the \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, \r\nincluding the unprecedented efforts of Qatar in that \r\nregard.  \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 34 \r\n \r\n The current challenges should give rise to \r\nrenewed international cooperation. The network of \r\ndemocratic solidarity that provides support to countries \r\nemerging from conflict or from autocratic regimes is \r\nfounded on a philosophy of freedom that repudiates \r\nthreats from international terrorism or radicalism, \r\nwhich have developed their own network as a sort of \r\nparallel globalization based on fear. However, the \r\ninternational network of cooperation should not have \r\nanxiety and fragility as its common denominators, but \r\ninstead the natural propensity of States and \r\norganizations that share the same values, principles and \r\nobjectives, namely, freedom and respect for the law \r\nand the dignity of the human being. Allow me to recall \r\nthat, on Romania’s initiative, in 2000 the General \r\nAssembly adopted its comprehensive resolution 55/96, \r\nwhich set out the defining characteristics of \r\ndemocracy. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Peacekeeping missions remain the backbone of \r\nthe international role of the United Nations. Post-\r\nconflict normalization and rebuilding should be an \r\nintegral part of the international strategy to deal with \r\npotential breaches of peace or the reignition of \r\nconflicts. My country acknowledges and praises the \r\nendeavours of United Nations personnel in Kenya, \r\nIraq, Myanmar, northern Uganda, Somalia, Cyprus, the \r\nCentral African Republic and Nepal. \r\n The progress made in Iraq and Afghanistan \r\nshould trigger renewed solidarity with the peoples of \r\nthose countries. The efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to stabilize and ensure the success of the \r\nongoing deep transformations in Iraq and Afghanistan \r\nshould be matched by renewed commitment on the part \r\nof the Iraqi and Afghan political leadership to reach \r\ncompromises and comprehensive agreements allowing \r\nfor political reconciliation and economic development. \r\n Romania remains committed to the democratic \r\nfuture of both countries. Romania was first among the \r\ncountries that are not members of the Paris Club to \r\nagree, in 2005, to the terms of debt relief for Iraq. The \r\nNATO summit held this year in Bucharest reconfirmed \r\nsolidarity and engagement with Afghanistan. Any \r\nsecurity agreements to complement or replace the \r\ncurrent security arrangements in Iraq have to take into \r\naccount the need to ensure the protection of United \r\nNations personnel in order that the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission for Iraq and the Organization’s \r\nspecialized agencies, funds and programmes can \r\nproperly fulfil their extended mandates in Iraq. \r\n I should now like to say a few words about the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Romania has encouraging \r\nexpectations following the start of the activities of the \r\nCouncil’s Universal Periodic Review mechanism. \r\nUnder the Romanian presidency, the Council examined \r\n32 national reports, including my country’s own report. \r\nThe debates generated valuable recommendations and \r\nentailed remarkable commitments with regard to the \r\nuniversal application of recognized international \r\nstandards for human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nWe should not weaken our support for the Human \r\nRights Council or for the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner. \r\n The widespread impact of humanitarian crises \r\nresulting from conflicts and natural disasters requires, \r\nagain and again, our solidarity with the people in need. \r\nThe tragedy of 7 million Sudanese, almost 5 million \r\nPalestinian refugees, 5 million Iraqi internally \r\ndisplaced persons and refugees, 3 million Afghan \r\nrefugees and 1.4 million Congolese and 1 million \r\nSomali internally displaced persons should catalyse \r\nconcrete actions of assistance. The recent Georgian \r\ncrisis also added to the international statistics on \r\ninternally displaced persons and refugees. Yet, numbers \r\nas such should not obscure in our conscience the \r\nterrible individual tragedies implied by these \r\nhumanitarian catastrophes. \r\n Aware of that plight, Romania is preparing to \r\nhost a special evacuation transit centre for persons in \r\nurgent need of international protection and onward \r\nresettlement. The centre would provide temporary \r\nshelter for refugees facing immediate danger in their \r\ncountries of origin, pending final resettlement in third \r\ncountries. \r\n The appalling humanitarian crises of recent \r\ndecades should prompt a renewed effort to define ways \r\nto prevent and adequately react to such situations and, \r\nfurthermore, to rebuild for durable conflict resolution. \r\nFurther efforts should be made to forge a common \r\nunderstanding of the conditions and application of the \r\nprinciple of the responsibility to protect.  \r\n Romania resolutely promotes international \r\ncooperation in the areas of crime prevention and \r\nbelieves that prosecutorial services represent one of the \r\nmain pillars of the criminal justice system. My country \r\nis preparing to host, in March 2009, the third world \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n35 08-53122 \r\n \r\nsummit of attorneys general, prosecutors general and \r\nchief prosecutors. The meeting is to be organized with \r\nthe support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime and will focus on prosecutorial independence \r\nfor effectiveness, integrity and public confidence. We \r\nlook forward to welcoming the international \r\ncommunity’s representatives in Bucharest next spring. \r\n Allow me now to turn to the issue of protracted \r\nconflicts. It has always been striking to hear the \r\nrecurrent references to frozen conflicts. Let us be \r\nhonest: no conflict stays frozen indefinitely without \r\nconsequences. The recent crisis in Georgia proved that \r\nthe international community cannot hide or shy away \r\nfrom dealing with uncertain situations under the \r\nassumption that they will simply disappear eventually. \r\nOn the contrary, uncertain situations and grey zones \r\ngradually produce effects, effect changes in the status \r\nquo and can, from apparent tranquillity, spew forth the \r\nmagma of delayed — and thus amplified — conflicts. \r\nA dormant volcano can still be an active one. Unsolved \r\nissues carrying latent threats are not socially or \r\npolitically neutral, since they generate new realities \r\nand risks to stability and security. \r\n Deferring the solution of a crisis is not a suitable \r\nanswer. Only a negotiated formula, with the support of \r\nbona fide international and regional mediation and \r\nassistance, can provide long-term and enduring \r\nsolutions. The crisis in South Ossetia, with its \r\nreverberations in Abkhazia and the entire State of \r\nGeorgia and beyond, should focus the attention of the \r\ninternational community on all protracted conflicts in \r\nthe area, including Transdniestria and Nagorny \r\nKarabakh. \r\n We have to have a new energetic and \r\ncomprehensive approach to the so-called protracted \r\nconflicts. It is time to jointly understand the danger and \r\ntake action. The United Nations and its Security \r\nCouncil should play their parts and accordingly assume \r\ntheir responsibility. Hesitation is not helping. Full \r\nobservance of all principles and norms of international \r\nlaw, including the territorial integrity of States, is a \r\nmust for all of us if we want peace, security, stability \r\nand prosperity to prevail. \r\n One of the main objectives of the international \r\ncommunity should be to consolidate stabilization and a \r\ndemocratic future across the entire Black Sea region. \r\nRomania promotes a wide range of cooperation ideas \r\nin the Black Sea area. If we take a closer look, we can \r\nsee a region with a large population, an important hub \r\nfor energy and transport flows and great economic \r\npotential. The United Nations should be there to assist \r\nthe region, not only in unfreezing conflicts but also in \r\nhelping coastal countries to cooperate to solve \r\nproblems related to pollution, illegal migration, \r\norganized crime and drug trafficking, so as to project \r\nstability and to support development. \r\n I now turn to disarmament, non-proliferation and \r\nthe fight against terrorism. I should like to underline \r\nthat responsibility and solidarity are also basic pillars \r\nof the international norms in that regard. That leads me \r\nto say, as many before me have done, that statements \r\nsuch as the one made a few days ago in the Assembly \r\nabout Israel are unacceptable. \r\n First, every State has an essential responsibility \r\nto effectively and comprehensively implement its \r\ncommitments by promoting the necessary legal \r\nframework and establishing appropriate mechanisms \r\nfor verification and control. \r\n Secondly, there is a need for solidarity and \r\ncooperation at the regional and multilateral levels so \r\nthat national measures and actions are recognized and \r\nimplemented. Romania has always demonstrated its \r\ninterest and readiness to work together with all States \r\nmembers of the international community in that \r\nrespect. The most recent proof of that is the \r\ncontribution of my country to the seven-nation \r\ninitiative on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nlaunched by Norway in 2005. Concrete examples of \r\nour involvement include the international seminar on \r\nhow the Black Sea region can contribute to improved \r\nglobal security, which was hosted in Bucharest in 2007, \r\nand other activities aimed at promoting the objectives \r\nof that cross-regional initiative. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Allow me to conclude by calling for effective \r\nmultilateralism and the strengthening of the United \r\nNations. After all, some questioned the relevance of the \r\nUnited Nations after the end of the cold war. The \r\nOrganization has never lacked for criticism or \r\nscepticism. We do not believe the issue to be one of \r\ntrying to regain a sense of lost purpose. The United \r\nNations continues to be the broadest and most \r\ninclusive Organization in the world and enjoys a \r\nspecial reputation and legitimacy. The United Nations \r\nprovides a forum for all Member States — large or \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 36 \r\n \r\nsmall, rich or poor, developed or developing — to have \r\ntheir voices heard and heeded.  \r\n Instead, the question for all Member States is \r\nhow to make the world Organization and its specialized \r\nagencies, funds and programmes more effective, \r\nresponsible and coherent in the face of new and \r\nongoing challenges. If the moral imperative that should \r\nlead us to carry out our responsibilities and \r\ndemonstrate solidarity in order to advance the cause of \r\nhumankind is not enough, then what we need is to look \r\ntowards the pragmatic aspect, namely, the utility and \r\nsense implied in the fact that the world’s well-being \r\ncontributes to the well-being of our own countries and \r\ncitizens. \r\n History is a good teacher, provided we learn from \r\nits lessons. History shows us the virtues of joint efforts \r\nand the benefits of cooperation. We are still far from \r\nthe Kantian dream of a stable world order that is \r\ndemocratic and prosperous. But we can move ever \r\ncloser to it through multilateralism and the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Aïchatou Mindaoudou, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and African \r\nIntegration of the Niger. \r\n Ms. Mindaoudou (Niger) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, Sir, I should like to warmly congratulate \r\nyou on your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session, which undeniably \r\nreflects the high esteem that the international \r\ncommunity has for your country of Nicaragua, which is \r\na friend of Niger. Your election is also the well-\r\ndeserved culmination of an exemplary diplomatic and \r\npolitical career. The length and breadth of your \r\nexperience makes you the right person to carry out the \r\ndemanding and noble task entrusted to you. Allow me \r\nto assure you of my delegation’s commitment to \r\nextending to you our constant support during your time \r\nin office. Niger is particularly honoured to be working \r\nside by side with you as a Vice-President of the \r\nAssembly for the sixty-third session. \r\n May I also pay tribute to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for the exemplary manner in which \r\nhe led the sixty-second session and, in particular, for \r\nhaving grappled with the burning issues of the day, \r\nincluding the food and energy crises and climate \r\nchange. With regard to His Excellency Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, I should like to express our full \r\nappreciation for the significant progress on \r\nfundamental issues made by the Organization under his \r\nguidance.  \r\n The subject you have chosen, Mr. President, as \r\nthe central theme of the general debate during this \r\nsession is highly relevant. For several months and to \r\nvarying degrees, all members of the international \r\ncommunity have been affected by the overall rise in \r\nfood prices. That crisis has gripped the attention of \r\nevery international body. Mr. Olivier de Schutter, \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the right to food, was far-\r\nsighted in sounding an alarm during a press conference \r\nheld here at the United Nations in which he identified \r\nthe initial structural causes and called for international \r\naction. Aware of the urgency of the situation, the \r\nSecretary-General set up the High-Level Task Force on \r\nthe Global Food Security Crisis in order to provide a \r\ncomprehensive and unified respond, support \r\nGovernments and peoples affected and adopt a \r\nComprehensive Framework for Action to meet the \r\nchallenges.  \r\n The Government of Niger would like to \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his initiatives. \r\nWe would also like to warmly congratulate his Task \r\nForce for their work and for taking into consideration \r\nthe numerous efforts and views on this issue. The \r\nchallenge now is to implement the recommendations in \r\norder to save entire groups of people in the world’s \r\nmost vulnerable countries from the tragedy of hunger. \r\n For its part, Niger has taken major specific \r\nmeasures to address the sharp rise in the cost of basic \r\nfoodstuffs in order to mitigate the effects on the living \r\nconditions of the most vulnerable people. \r\n However, in a country facing the recurrent \r\nproblem of drought and its consequences for \r\nagricultural production, the truth is that only lasting \r\nsolutions will help us to counter the effects of the \r\nphenomenon and to progressively eliminate the \r\nuncertainty that characterizes Niger’s production \r\nsystem.  \r\n The Government of Niger has therefore decided \r\nto give priority to the three programmes introduced at \r\nthe Doha Conference on Consolidating Food Self-\r\nsufficiency in Niger, which was held in June 2007. \r\nThose programmes are all the more promising given \r\nthe potential boon to agriculture as a result of the \r\nupcoming construction of the Khandaji dam on the \r\nNiger River. The Government will develop its \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n37 08-53122 \r\n \r\napproach on the basis of that project and those \r\nprogrammes so as to provide credible response to meet \r\nthe food needs of the people of Niger. \r\n The international financial crisis, which is \r\naffecting many countries and is today being \r\nexacerbated by the globalization of the world in which \r\nwe live, requires that we harness our efforts and \r\ninitiatives to find solutions requiring commitment on \r\nthe part of us all. While rich countries fear the risk of \r\nwidespread economic recession, the poorest countries \r\nfear food insecurity caused by prices they can no \r\nlonger afford. Paradoxically, when it comes to the \r\nfinancial crisis and the consequences of climate \r\nchange, it is the poorest countries that always pay most \r\ndearly for the turbulence affecting the globalized \r\nworld. My delegation therefore supports the proposals \r\nmade by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, which \r\nwere previously espoused by President Lula da Silva of \r\nBrazil, calling on the international community to deal \r\nurgently with the issue.  \r\n We also hold out hope that the upcoming Doha \r\nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment will produce results that include safety \r\nnet measures to protect the poorest countries from \r\nexternal shocks that could compound their \r\nvulnerabilities.  \r\n Although the food, energy and financial crises are \r\nfront and centre on the international stage, there are \r\nalso other challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity in the areas of peace, security, development \r\nand human rights, among others. We must \r\nacknowledge the fact that international peace and \r\nsecurity has been as sorely tested by conflicts as by \r\nother scourges that are equally devastating to the \r\nharmonious development of peoples and countries \r\nthroughout the world. Those scourges include \r\ninternational terrorism, drug trafficking and the illegal \r\ntrade in small arms.  \r\n Niger is especially concerned about the impact of \r\ntrafficking in drugs and weapons; and especially mines, \r\nthroughout the Sahelo-Saharan strip. The actions of \r\ncertain armed groups are the true cause of the unrest \r\nprevailing in the northern part of our territory. Their \r\nactivities are increasingly being brought under control \r\nthanks to steps taken by the relevant institutions of our \r\ncountry. We therefore believe that there is a need for \r\nincreased willingness and cooperation in this area, \r\nsimilar to that demonstrated in connection with the \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy that we adopted in \r\n2006. While we acknowledge that some progress has \r\nbeen made, we must also say that further efforts and \r\ncommitments are needed from the international \r\ncommunity in supporting countries in conflict or \r\nemerging from it. \r\n It is important that we support the progress made \r\nin countries where, happily, peace is becoming more \r\nentrenched, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Burundi, \r\nGuinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic, which \r\nwas recently inscribed on the agenda of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We welcome in particular \r\nthe resumption of the national peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess in Côte d’Ivoire following the invaluable \r\nimpetus provided by the Ouagadougou Agreement in \r\n2007. In that regard, my country congratulates and \r\nencourages all Ivorian politicians on their commitment \r\nto peace. We hope that, with the support of their \r\npartners, whose invaluable contributions my delegation \r\nalso commends, the national peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess will culminate in the holding of the upcoming \r\npresidential elections.  \r\n We also welcome the resumption of the \r\nManhasset cycle of negotiations as a useful and \r\nnecessary step in the search for a mutually acceptable \r\nand lasting solution to the issue of Western Sahara. \r\n With regard to the Great Lakes region, my \r\ndelegation welcomes the entry into force, on 21 June \r\n2008, on the Pact on Security, Stability and \r\nDevelopment in the Great Lakes Region. We believe \r\nthat this instrument will enable States parties to address \r\nthe underlying causes of conflict and to address the \r\nchallenges they face in the areas of security, \r\ngovernance and development. We also believe that the \r\nPact is part and parcel of the new vision for the \r\nsettlement of conflicts in Africa, perfect examples of \r\nwhich have just been provided by Nigeria and \r\nCameroon with the resolution of the issue of the \r\nBakassi peninsula, and by Gabon and Equatorial \r\nGuinea with the agreement on a mediation process in \r\nconnection with their territorial dispute. \r\n Nevertheless, conflicts persist in Africa and the \r\nMiddle East that require appropriate involvement by \r\nthe international community. With regard to the \r\nsituation in the Sudan, my delegation welcomes the \r\nappointment Mr. Djibril Yipènè Bassolé, former \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso, as the \r\nJoint African Union-United Nations Chief Mediator for \r\nA/63/PV.13  \r\n \r\n08-53122 38 \r\n \r\nDarfur. We are certain that Mr. Bassolé will provide \r\nnew momentum and help to improve the situation in \r\nthat brotherly country by, among other things, \r\nfacilitating the implementation of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement, signed in January 2006 between the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the Sudan People’s \r\nLiberation Movement/Army with regard to the \r\nSouthern Sudan, and by helping to find an acceptable \r\nsolution for Darfur. \r\n With regard to Somalia, we welcome the \r\nagreement signed on 9 June in Djibouti between the \r\nTransitional Federal Government and the Alliance for \r\nthe Re-Liberation of Somalia. We urge the United \r\nNations to do everything possible to support those \r\ncountries, both by more effectively backing the African \r\nUnion Mission in Somalia and by deploying an \r\ninternational peacebuilding or peacekeeping force. \r\n The bilateral negotiations between Israelis and \r\nPalestinians that have begun in the context of the \r\ncommitments undertaken at the Annapolis Conference \r\nare a genuine source of satisfaction for my delegation. \r\nWe believe that the parties should take advantage of \r\nthose negotiations. We therefore encourage them to \r\nmaintain the momentum of Annapolis, which reflected \r\nthe willingness of the parties concerned to make \r\nprogress towards peace. We should also like to \r\nwelcome the recent initiative of President Nicolas \r\nSarkozy of France in the context of the Euro-\r\nMediterranean Conference. We fervently hope that all \r\nthose measures will make it possible to reach a speedy \r\nagreement that enshrines the vision of the two-State \r\nsolution of Palestine and Israel living side by side in \r\npeace and security within internationally recognized \r\nborders and on the basis of the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe Security Council, the Arab peace initiative and the \r\nQuartet’s road map. \r\n We welcome the Doha agreement on Lebanon, \r\nwhich confirmed the virtue of dialogue and cleared the \r\npath for speedy presidential elections and the \r\nestablishment of a Government. The international \r\ncommunity should support the Lebanese people who, \r\nthrough that agreement, have demonstrated their \r\npolitical maturity and ongoing desire for national unity. \r\n The various peace processes now underway will \r\nnot be successful unless confidence-building measures \r\nare first put in place. In that regard, there is a crucial \r\nneed to find solutions to the issues of disarmament, \r\nnon-proliferation and the eradication of the trade in \r\nsmall arms. That is especially true for the poorest \r\ncountries, who pay a heavy price in conflicts sustained \r\nby the trade in small arms and light weapons. My \r\ndelegation therefore deplores the failure at the past \r\nsession of the Disarmament Commission, another in a \r\nseries due to the lack of consensus on the agenda. \r\n As we have seen, the challenges in the area of \r\ninternational peace and security are numerous and \r\ncomplex. Unfortunately, for some of us they are \r\naccentuated by other serious, recurring and even \r\nchronic threats. As the 2005 World Summit \r\nacknowledged in its Outcome Document, those threats, \r\nwhich also have an effect on development, are closely \r\nlinked to other areas in which the United Nations is \r\nactive, namely, peace, security and human rights.  \r\n We therefore believe that the year 2008 is critical, \r\ngiven that it is replete with major events that could \r\ncontribute to development. I am referring to the Doha \r\nRound of trade negotiations, which are at a standstill \r\ntoday; the high-level event on the implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) midpoint \r\nto the target date for their implementation, the Accra \r\nHigh-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness; and the \r\nReview Conference of the Monterrey Consensus on \r\nfinancing for development.  \r\n In the quest for global well-being, Africa and \r\ncountries in special circumstances — especially least \r\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries \r\nand small island States — deserve focused attention \r\ncommensurate with their situation. My delegation \r\nwould like to pay homage to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his personal commitment and unwavering \r\nsupport for initiatives in that regard intended to benefit \r\nAfrica. Following the G8 Summit at Heiligendamm, \r\nthe Secretary-General established the Africa Steering \r\nGroup to monitor the achievement of the MDGs in \r\nAfrica. With the support of a working group, the \r\nSteering Group is responsible for finding ways to \r\ncoordinate and rationalize efforts associated with \r\ntechnical and financial assistance in order to speed up \r\nAfrica’s progress. That initiative is very timely for a \r\ncountry like Niger, whose strategy to reduce poverty \r\nand speed up development for the period 2009-2012 \r\nfocuses precisely on the achievement of the MDGs. \r\nMoreover, the various efforts of the Government in \r\nrecent years in the areas of health, education and \r\naccess to water have already led to a significant \r\nimprovement in the relevant indicators. \r\n A/63/PV.13\r\n \r\n39 08-53122 \r\n \r\n The recommendations of the Steering Group and \r\nthe conclusions of the recent high-level meeting on the \r\nMDGs, jointly organized by the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretary-General, provide a \r\nvery clear course of action for making progress.  \r\n Sustainable development is the main theme of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council’s 2008 substantive \r\nsession. The current debate has clearly shown that such \r\ndevelopment cannot be achieved without appropriate \r\nfunding, aid effectiveness and good governance.  \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of Niger believes \r\nthat the United Nations is the world’s premier forum. It \r\nmust serve as a beacon in those times of both hope and \r\nuncertainty, and ensure collective security in the world \r\nby means of economic, social and cultural cooperation. \r\n \r\nThat is why we need genuine reform of the United \r\nNations system. My delegation believes that the reform \r\neffort will remain incomplete unless there is a \r\nsignificant change in the Security Council, including as \r\nregards both equitable representation and its working \r\nmethods.  \r\n In numerous other areas currently under \r\nconsideration — such as, among others, evaluating the \r\nexperiences of countries involved in pilot programmes \r\non system-wide coherence and revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly, which we must ensure — my country will \r\ncontribute as much as it can to adapting our common \r\nOrganization to the challenges we all face in building a \r\nworld of peace, prosperity and development.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
