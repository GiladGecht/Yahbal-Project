(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sergey V. Lavrov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Russian Federation. \r\n Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): On 11 September 2001, the world changed, \r\nand it rallied together in the fight against the threat of \r\nterror, a threat that was common for all and knew no \r\nboundaries. I am referring to threat of terrorism. The \r\nworld displayed an unprecedented level of solidarity by \r\nrejecting old phobias and stereotypes. It seemed that \r\nthe global counter-terrorism coalition became a new \r\nreality that from then on would define the development \r\nof a system of international relations free from double \r\nstandards and beneficial to all. \r\n The cohesion in the face of the deadly threats \r\nemerging from Al-Qaida and other elements of \r\ninternational terrorism made it possible to achieve \r\ntangible success during the initial stage. But later, \r\nproblems began to appear. A painful blow to the unity \r\nof the anti-terrorism coalition was delivered by the war \r\nin Iraq, when — as it turned out later, under the false \r\npretext of the fight against terror and nuclear arms \r\nproliferation — international law was violated. The \r\ndeepest crisis was thus created in a completely \r\nartificial way and even today it is far from being \r\nresolved. \r\n Ever more questions are being raised about what \r\nis going on in Afghanistan. First and foremost, what is \r\nthe acceptable price to pay in terms of the loss of \r\ncivilians’ lives in the ongoing counter-terrorism \r\noperation? Who decides on criteria for determining \r\nproportionality in the use of force? And why are the \r\ninternational contingents that are present unwilling to \r\nengage in the fight against the proliferating drug threat \r\nthat causes increasing suffering in the countries of \r\nCentral Asia and Europe? These and other factors give \r\nus reason to believe that the counter-terrorism coalition \r\nis faced with a crisis.  \r\n Looking at the core of the problem, it seems that \r\nthis coalition lacks the requisite collective \r\narrangements: equality among all its members in \r\ndeciding on strategy and, especially, operational \r\ntactics. But in order to control the entirely new \r\nsituation that evolved after 9/11, which required \r\ngenuine cooperative effort, including joint analysis and \r\ncoordination of practical steps, mechanisms designed \r\nfor a unipolar world began to be used; decisions were \r\ntaken in a single centre of power, while the rest merely \r\nhad to follow. \r\n We ended up with a privatization of the \r\ninternational community’s efforts in the fight against \r\nterrorism. The inertia of the unipolar world also \r\nrevealed itself in other spheres of international life, \r\nincluding unilateral steps taken in anti-missile defence \r\nand the militarization of outer space as well as in \r\nattempts to bypass parity in arms control regimes, \r\nexpansion of political-military blocs, and politicization \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 2 \r\n \r\nof the issues of access to and transport of energy \r\nresources. \r\n The illusion of the existence of a unipolar world \r\nconfused many. For some people, it generated a desire \r\nto place all of their eggs in one basket. In exchange for \r\nabsolute loyalty, there was an expectation of carte \r\nblanche to resolve all problems, using any means. The \r\nemerging syndrome of complete permissiveness that \r\ndeveloped led to a rampage on the night of 8 August, \r\nwhen aggression was unleashed on South Ossetia. The \r\nbombing of the sleeping city of Tskhinvali and the \r\nkilling of civilians and peacekeepers trampled under \r\nfoot all existing settlement agreements, thus putting an \r\nend to the territorial integrity of Georgia. \r\n Russia helped South Ossetia to repel that \r\naggression, and carried out its duty to protect its \r\ncitizens and fulfil its peacekeeping commitments. \r\nRussia’s recognition of the independence of South \r\nOssetia and Abkhazia was the only possible step to \r\nensure not only their security, but also the very survival \r\nof their peoples, considering the previous record of \r\nchauvinism of the Georgian leaders — starting with the \r\nGeorgian leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia who, in 1991, \r\nunder the slogan of “Georgia for Georgians”, ordered \r\nthe deportation of Ossetians to Russia, abolished the \r\nautonomous status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and \r\nlater unleashed a bloody war against them.  \r\n That war was brought to an end at the cost of \r\ninnumerable human lives, and peacekeeping and \r\nnegotiation mechanisms were established with the \r\napproval of the United Nations and the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). \r\nHowever, the current Georgian leadership has pursued \r\na persistent policy of undermining those mechanisms \r\nthrough relentless provocation, and finally nullified the \r\npeace process by launching a new murderous war on \r\nthe night of 8 August. \r\n This problem is now closed. The future of the \r\npeoples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia has been \r\nreliably secured by the treaties between Moscow and \r\nTskhinvali and Sukhumi. With the implementation of \r\nthe Medvedev-Sarkozy plan, to which we are strongly \r\ncommitted, the situation around the two republics will \r\nfinally be stabilized. It is important that this plan \r\nshould be strictly and unswervingly implemented by all \r\nparties. We are concerned, however, by the attempts to \r\nrewrite it after the fact. \r\n I believe that everyone here has tired of playing \r\nthe role of extras for the Georgian regime, whose \r\nwords contain not a shred of truth and whose foreign \r\npolicy is aimed exclusively at provoking confrontation \r\nthroughout the world in the pursuit of their own \r\nobjectives which invariably run counter to the \r\nobjectives of the Georgian people and to the goal of \r\nensuring security in the Caucasus. \r\n Today, it is necessary to analyse the crisis in the \r\nCaucasus from the viewpoint of its impact on the \r\nregion and the international community as a whole. \r\nThe world has changed yet again. It has become \r\nabsolutely clear that the solidarity demonstrated after \r\n9/11 must be revived through approaches untainted by \r\ngeopolitical expediency and built on the rejection of \r\ndouble standards when fighting against any violations \r\nor breaches of international law — whether on the part \r\nof terrorists, political extremists or any others. \r\n The crisis in the Caucasus has proved again that \r\nit is impossible to resolve the problems we face when \r\nblinded by the mirage of a unipolar world. The price \r\nwe will have to pay in terms of human lives and \r\ndestinies is too high. We cannot tolerate any attempts \r\nto resolve conflict situations by violating international \r\nagreements or by the unlawful use of force. If we allow \r\nthat to occur once, then we run the risk of unleashing it \r\nin the future. \r\n One cannot invoke the duty to defend in the \r\nabstract, and then be outraged when that principle is \r\nused in practice — and in strict conformity with Article \r\n51 of the United Nations Charter and other norms of \r\ninternational law. In South Ossetia, Russia defended \r\nthe highest of our common values, the most essential \r\nhuman right: the right to live.  \r\n The existing security architecture in Europe did \r\nnot pass the test of recent events. Attempts to adjust it \r\nto the rules of a unipolar world led to a situation where \r\nthat architecture proved incapable of containing an \r\naggressor or  preventing the supply of offensive \r\nweapons to it, contrary to all existing relevant codes of \r\nconduct. \r\n We propose that this issue should be addressed in \r\na comprehensive manner. President Dmitry \r\nA. Medvedev, of Russia, speaking in Berlin on 5 June, \r\nproposed an initiative on developing a Euro-Atlantic \r\nsecurity treaty, a type of “Helsinki II”. This work could \r\nhave been started at the Pan-European summit with the \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n3 08-53129 \r\n \r\nparticipation of all States as well as all organizations \r\nworking in the region. \r\n The treaty which we are proposing is meant to \r\ncreate a reliable collective security system that would \r\nensure equal security for all States and set out, in \r\nlegally binding form, the bases of relations among all \r\nparticipants, with a view to strengthening peace, \r\nensuring stability and promoting integrated and \r\nmanageable development efforts across the vast Euro-\r\nAtlantic region. This would be a process in which all \r\nparties would reaffirm their commitment to \r\nfundamental principles of international law, such as the \r\nnon-use of force; peaceful settlement of disputes; \r\nsovereignty; territorial integrity; non-interference in \r\ninternal affairs; and the inadmissibility of \r\nstrengthening one’s own security by infringing upon or \r\nendangering the security of others. We also need to \r\nconsider together new mechanisms to ensure \r\ncompliance with those fundamental principles. \r\nNaturally, such a treaty should organically fit into the \r\nlegal framework of the United Nations Charter and its \r\nprinciples of collective security. \r\n The cold war distorted the nature of international \r\nrelations and turned them into an arena for ideological \r\nconfrontation. Only now, after the cold war has ended, \r\ncan the United Nations, created on the basis of a \r\npolycentric vision of the world, fully realize its \r\npotential. Today as never before, it is important that all \r\nStates reaffirm their commitment to the United Nations \r\nas a global forum, to which there is no alternative and \r\nwhich possesses a universal mandate and generally \r\nrecognized legitimacy, and as a centre for open, candid \r\nand frank debate and coordination of world policies on \r\na just and equitable basis free from double standards. \r\nThis is an essential requirement to ensure that the \r\nworld regains its equilibrium. \r\n The multitude of challenges that humanity is \r\nfacing require comprehensive strengthening of the \r\nUnited Nations. In order to keep up with the times, the \r\nUnited Nations requires further rational reform to be \r\nable to gradually adapt itself to existing political and \r\neconomic realities. On the whole, we are satisfied by \r\nthe progress of the reform, including the initial results \r\nof the activities of the recently established \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil.  \r\n With regard to expansion of the membership of \r\nthe Security Council, we will, of course, welcome \r\nproposals that do not divide United Nations Member \r\nStates but rather facilitate the search for mutually \r\nacceptable compromises and lead to a broad-based \r\nagreement. \r\n Of increasing importance in the reform process is \r\nthe promotion of dialogue and partnership among \r\ncivilizations. Russia supports the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and other initiatives in that regard. We \r\nreiterate our proposal that a consultative council of \r\nreligions be established under United Nations auspices, \r\ntaking into account the increasing role of the religious \r\naspect in international life. That would assist in \r\nstrengthening moral principles and incorporating them \r\ninto international affairs.  \r\n Among the priorities of United Nations activities, \r\na number of urgent issues have recently appeared on \r\nthe Organization’s agenda, including climate change \r\nand food and energy security. Those problems are \r\nglobal and interrelated, and they can be addressed and \r\nresolved only through a global partnership at a \r\nqualitatively new level, with active involvement by \r\nGovernments, the scientific and business communities \r\nand civil society. \r\n In particular, the current financial crisis requires \r\nurgent attention and synergy of efforts. From this \r\nrostrum, the President of France has put forward \r\nimportant initiatives aimed at a cooperative search for \r\nways to revitalize the international financial system \r\nthat involve the world’s leading economies. In that \r\ncontext, we support the further development of \r\npartnerships between the members of the Group of \r\nEight and key States in all developing regions. The \r\nEconomic and Social Council could also play a role \r\nhere. Russia will continue to participate responsibly in \r\nthe work of various bodies of the United Nations \r\nsystem and in other contexts to help find an equitable \r\nsolution to all those problems. \r\n The international development assistance \r\nmechanisms being established in Russia will help us to \r\nincrease the extent and effectiveness of our \r\nparticipation in international efforts to fight hunger and \r\ndisease, to promote broader access to education and to \r\novercome energy shortages, which will be our \r\nadditional contribution to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. It is only natural that, \r\nin so doing, we should pay particular attention to \r\nassisting nearby countries. All countries have partners \r\nwith which they share traditional friendly relations \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 4 \r\n \r\nbased on a common history and geography. It is wrong \r\nto artificially undermine such relationships for the \r\nbenefit of geopolitical schemes and against the will of \r\nthe people.  \r\n We will continue to work together with all our \r\nneighbours. First and foremost, along with the other \r\ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, \r\nwe will continue to develop the integration processes \r\nwithin the Collective Security Treaty Organization and \r\nthe Eurasian Economic Community in order to \r\npreserve and promote our common heritage of culture \r\nand civilization, which, in a globalizing world, is a \r\nmajor resource of the Commonwealth and of each of its \r\nmember States. That is why we have a particular \r\ninterest in cooperating with those countries, and it is \r\nalso why they view Russia as an area of special \r\ninterest. We will therefore base our relations on the \r\nprinciples of equality, mutual benefit, respect for and \r\nconsideration of one another’s interests and compliance \r\nwith existing agreements, in particular those on the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. That is also the way in \r\nwhich we intend to develop our relations in other \r\nregions of the world: openly, on the basis of \r\ninternational law and without any zero-sum games. \r\nThose principles were set out in the foreign policy \r\nconcept approved by President Medvedev in July this \r\nyear.  \r\n Russia is consistently implementing its network \r\ndiplomacy and promoting cooperation in various \r\nformats: the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the \r\nBRIC countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — \r\npartnership mechanisms with the European Union, the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the League of \r\nArab States and regional organizations in Latin \r\nAmerica. \r\n The developments that occurred in August gave \r\nus yet another occasion to think about the \r\nresponsibility to report events accurately. Distortions \r\nof reality hamper international efforts to settle conflicts \r\nand crises and revive the worst practices of the cold-\r\nwar era. If we wish to prevent the truth from becoming \r\nthe first casualty of war, we must draw the appropriate \r\nconclusions, in particular in the light of a provision of \r\nthe 1970 Declaration on Principles of International \r\nLaw concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation \r\namong States in accordance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, which states that States have the duty \r\nto refrain from propaganda for wars of aggression. \r\nThat is in line with the Guidelines on protecting \r\nfreedom of expression and information in times of \r\ncrisis, recently adopted by the Committee of Ministers \r\nof the Council of Europe. I propose that the United \r\nNations also issue a statement on that issue, this time \r\nin a universal context.  \r\n The obvious global effects of the crisis in the \r\nCaucasus show that the world has changed for \r\neveryone. There are now fewer illusions and fewer \r\npretexts for refusing to respond to the most urgent \r\nchallenges of modern times. That is precisely why we \r\nhope that the international community will, on the \r\nbasis of common sense, finally manage to develop a \r\nprogramme of collective action for the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdelwaheb Abdallah, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Tunisia. \r\n Mr. Abdallah (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I wish \r\nat the outset to sincerely congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session. We are convinced that your \r\ndiplomatic ability and skill will help us to ensure the \r\nsuccess of this session and to attain the objectives to \r\nwhich we all aspire. I should also like to thank \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim for his excellent work and his \r\nvaluable contributions to the smooth conduct of the \r\nprevious session. Our sincere thanks go also to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his generous \r\nefforts to promote the work of the Organization and to \r\nenhance its performance in addressing various issues of \r\nimportance to our countries and peoples. \r\n The choice of the main theme of this year’s \r\ngeneral debate — the impact of the global food crisis \r\non poverty and hunger in the world — reflects the \r\nimportance of that issue and the growing awareness \r\namong all countries of its seriousness and of the need \r\nto work together to find effective solutions to reduce \r\nits impact and repercussions on national economies, \r\nparticularly those of developing and poor countries, \r\nand on the increasing rates of poverty and hunger \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n In that context, the central role played by the \r\nUnited Nations is of crucial importance in addressing \r\nthose issues and in striving to achieve a better balance \r\nin international relations and greater solidarity, justice \r\nand equality. That requires that we enhance the \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n5 08-53129 \r\n \r\nOrganization’s reform process and strengthen its \r\ncapacity to keep abreast of international developments. \r\n In recent years, the world situation has been \r\ncharacterized by increasingly swift change, which has \r\ndisrupted international balances and undermined \r\nprevailing development formulas. It has also created \r\nmany problems and difficulties that have clearly \r\naffected the economies and development processes of \r\nmany countries. In addition, it has weakened their \r\ncapacity to make progress and increased their \r\nvulnerability. Furthermore, the world has recently \r\nwitnessed serious economic problems, in particular an \r\nexcessive rise in oil and basic food prices, which has \r\nthreatened world food security and reduced the \r\npurchasing power of individuals, thus hampering the \r\nachievement of the goals and approaches set at the \r\nMillennium Summit. If we are to address this grave \r\nsituation, we must step up international efforts by \r\nadopting development strategies based on the noble \r\nhuman aspects of world solidarity. In that context, \r\nTunisia has called on international financial institutions \r\nand other organizations that specialize in economy and \r\ntrade to establish and implement agricultural and \r\nproduction policies that guarantee the availability of \r\nfood, which is a fundamental right enshrined in \r\ninternational human rights instruments. \r\n I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nour call for intensified efforts to operationalize the \r\nWorld Solidarity Fund, endorsed by the General \r\nAssembly in 2002 (resolution 57/265) on the initiative \r\nof Tunisia as a mechanism to address the issues of \r\npoverty and privation in the world and to reduce \r\ndisparities among peoples. \r\n In order to keep abreast of the profound changes \r\non the international scene and the new realities they \r\nhave produced in international relations, along with the \r\nvarious challenges and complexities those changes \r\nrepresent, we must act to strengthen the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations to act more efficiently. We must also \r\nendeavour to reform the Organization, develop its \r\nstructures and enhance the role it is expected to play to \r\nameliorate the current international situation and turn \r\nglobalization into a process that helps to guarantee \r\npeace and development for all peoples. \r\n In that context, Tunisia supports all efforts and \r\ninitiatives aimed at establishing new frameworks and \r\nmechanisms for action that can help to find collective \r\nsolutions to common challenges in the vital fields of \r\nsecurity, peace, development, the environment and \r\nfood security, as part of an appropriate approach to \r\ninternational relations founded on the complementarity \r\nbetween peace, security and development. However, \r\nthat should be accompanied by strengthened \r\nmultilateral action on the basis of cooperation, \r\nsolidarity and a constructive dialogue among all \r\ncountries. \r\n Despite efforts to contain it, the heightened \r\nproblem of terrorism in the world strengthens our \r\nbelief in the need to unify the international approach to \r\nfighting that scourge and finding adequate solutions to \r\nit. Since the early 1990s, Tunisia has warned the \r\ninternational community against the dangers of \r\nterrorism and has called for the adoption of a \r\ncomprehensive and efficient approach that takes into \r\nconsideration the root causes of the scourge. Today, we \r\nrenew the call of His Excellency President Zine El \r\nAbidine Ben Ali to convene an international \r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations to \r\ndevelop an international code of conduct for the fight \r\nagainst terrorism to which all parties shall commit \r\nthemselves. \r\n Climate change and the resulting intensification \r\nof the problems of desertification, drought and the lack \r\nof drinking water pose a threat to all humankind today \r\nand are a source of great concern to all. While \r\naffirming the close link between the environment and \r\ndevelopment and the crucial importance of promoting \r\ncooperation and solidarity to respond to the challenges \r\nin that regard, we should like to emphasize the need to \r\ninclude concerns about the potential effects of climate \r\nchange, particularly in the African and Mediterranean \r\nregions, among the international community’s \r\npriorities, as called for in the Tunis Declaration \r\nadopted by the International Solidarity Conference on \r\nClimate Change Strategies for the African and \r\nMediterranean Regions, which was held in Tunisia in \r\nNovember 2007. \r\n We would also like to reiterate the need to \r\nmobilize the necessary financial resources to promote \r\nresearch into climate monitoring and meteorology and \r\nthe development of natural disaster early warning \r\nsystems, in addition to the need to invest in reducing \r\nthe greenhouse gas emissions that cause global \r\nwarming. \r\n We are convinced that the success of \r\ndevelopment efforts and the strengthening of \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 6 \r\n \r\ncooperation among our countries depend on providing \r\na secure and stable international environment. \r\nObstacles to success in that effort include the \r\nintensification of tensions and conflicts and the \r\npersistence of unresolved problems. In that regard, we \r\nreaffirm Tunisia’s commitment to the values of peace \r\nand to the principles of international legality as the \r\npath to achieving just and lasting solutions to pending \r\ninternational issues. We also renew our determination \r\nto promote the values of moderation, tolerance and \r\nmutual respect in relations among countries and \r\npeoples and to establish bridges of communication and \r\ndialogue among all civilizations, cultures and religions. \r\n In that context, while reaffirming Tunisia’s \r\nposition in support of our Palestinian brothers and their \r\njust cause as a people, we renew our call to the \r\ninternational community, especially its most influential \r\nmembers and the Quartet, to increase their efforts to \r\nbring Israel to end its aggressive practices and \r\nsettlement activities. We call on them to intensify their \r\nwork to reinvigorate the peace effort and to facilitate \r\nthe resumption of negotiations between Palestinians \r\nand Israelis on the basis of the relevant international \r\nterms of reference, the Arab Peace Initiative and the \r\nresults of the Annapolis Conference, with the aim of \r\nachieving a just, lasting and comprehensive solution to \r\nthe Palestinian question.  \r\n Such a solution would guarantee that the \r\nPalestinians regain their legitimate national rights and \r\nestablish an independent Palestinian State on their \r\nnational territory. It would also guarantee the \r\nwithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories, \r\nincluding Syrian and Lebanese land. That solution \r\nwould also provide security and stability for all the \r\npeoples of the region. \r\n We also call for joint regional and international \r\nefforts to address the deterioration of security and \r\nhumanitarian conditions in Iraq and to help the \r\nbrotherly Iraqi people to restore security and stability \r\nso that they may devote their energies to reconstruction \r\nefforts while preserving their national and territorial \r\nunity. \r\n We wish to take this opportunity to express our \r\nsatisfaction with the recent positive developments in \r\nour sisterly country of Lebanon, namely, the election of \r\nthe country’s President and the establishment of a \r\nGovernment of national unity. We trust that our \r\nLebanese brothers will further strengthen that process \r\nin order to preserve Lebanon’s security and stability. \r\n Since the change of 7 November 1987, and under \r\nthe wise leadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben \r\nAli, President of the Republic of Tunisia, we have \r\nsucceeded in accomplishing remarkable achievements \r\nin every area, due to substantial reforms that have \r\nstrengthened the democratic process, promoted \r\nmechanisms to protect human rights and culture and \r\nconsecrated public freedoms. Those reforms have \r\nenabled us to expand the scope of consultation and \r\nparticipation by the various sectors of civil society in \r\nidentifying major trends and determining crucial \r\nnational options within the framework of the rule of \r\nlaw and respect for institutions. \r\n Those reforms have also made it possible to \r\nachieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhich has led to the improvement of living standards \r\nand the well-being of all segments of Tunisian society. \r\nThose achievements reflect the sound development \r\nchoices and approaches implemented in Tunisia, which \r\nhave allowed us to reach a high position on the list of \r\ncountries with the highest human development \r\nindicators. That has earned Tunisia the respect of \r\ninternational financial institutions and the specialized \r\nagencies of the United Nations. \r\n In its various development plans, Tunisia has \r\ncontinued to work for development and modernization \r\nin order to strengthen its capacity to keep up with \r\ninternational changes and actively contribute to \r\nbuilding a world of peace and security and to make \r\ninternational relations more balanced and based on \r\nsolidarity. \r\n Based on its desire to achieve a higher level of \r\nintegration at the regional and international levels, \r\nTunisia is working to expand its participation in \r\nregional and international organizations and to develop \r\npolitical relations with friendly countries. It also \r\nendeavouring to expand and diversify its scope of \r\ncooperation with them so as to establish an effective \r\npartnership based on mutual respect and common \r\ninterests. In that regard, Tunisia firmly believes that the \r\nArab Maghreb Union is a strategic and crucial choice \r\nfor all peoples of the region. In cooperation and \r\ncoordination with the other friendly Maghreb \r\ncountries, we are sparing no effort to speed up the \r\nestablishment of the Union.  \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n7 08-53129 \r\n \r\n Tunisia is also eager to promote joint Arab action \r\nand to enhance its ability to interact with regional and \r\ninternational bodies in order to address the changes \r\ntaking place in the region and to contribute to the \r\npromotion of the reform and modernization process in \r\nthe Arab world, in conformity with the decisions of the \r\n2004 Arab summit held in Tunis. \r\n With regard to Africa, Tunisia is contributing to \r\nthe achievement of peace and security in the continent \r\nby participating in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations and by developing economic relations with \r\nfriendly African countries. Based on our belief in the \r\nimportance of joint African action and the fact that the \r\nAfrican Union is the ideal framework to address the \r\ncontinent’s problems and achieve the integration to \r\nwhich our peoples aspire, Tunisia reaffirms its strong \r\ndetermination to pursue the process decided within the \r\nframework of the African Union to establish and \r\noperationalize its institutions, enhance its role in the \r\nresolution of conflicts and promote the development \r\nprocess in Africa. \r\n With regard to Europe, Tunisia attaches strategic \r\nimportance to its relations with the European Union \r\n(EU) and is continuing to work to develop those \r\nrelations on the basis of a solidarity-based partnership \r\nwith EU countries on the basis of dialogue, cooperation \r\nand mutual respect. The building of a Euro-\r\nMediterranean cooperation framework is one of \r\nTunisia’s priorities and a tenet of its foreign policy. \r\nTunisia has therefore supported every initiative and \r\nmechanism that contributes to the promotion of peace, \r\nsolidarity and development in the Mediterranean \r\nregion — including the Barcelona process, the 5+5 \r\nDialogue, and the Mediterranean Forum. \r\n Tunisia was among the first countries to welcome \r\nthe French initiative on the establishment of the Union \r\nfor the Mediterranean. We are convinced that the future \r\nof that initiative depends upon an effective partnership \r\nthat guarantees the active participation of the countries \r\nof the southern Mediterranean in establishing the \r\nfoundations of the Union and in the taking of decisions \r\nof concern to the region. \r\n Meeting the challenges posed by the new \r\ninternational situation and the profound changes taking \r\nplace on the world scene requires us all to step up \r\nefforts to further entrench the noble universal \r\nprinciples and humanist values on which the United \r\nNations was founded. It also requires perseverance in \r\nenhancing the process of United Nations reform to \r\nmake its work more efficient and to ensure its active \r\ncontribution to providing optimum international \r\nconditions that can help us find collective solutions to \r\ncommon challenges and current international issues, \r\nrespond to our peoples’ aspirations for stability, and \r\nprovide the appropriate conditions for prosperity and \r\nwell-being in an environment of cooperation and \r\nsolidarity-based development. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Kinga Göncz, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Hungary. \r\n Ms. Göncz (Hungary): At the outset, allow me to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. In \r\nfulfilling your challenging tasks during this session, \r\nyou may rest assured of the support and cooperation of \r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Hungary. I also wish \r\nto salute your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, \r\nrepresentative of the Eastern European Group, who \r\nserved us with distinction and dedication. \r\n The challenges we have to face daily in an \r\nincreasingly globalized world require answers based on \r\nthe principle of universally accepted values and the \r\npractice of flexible adaptation to swift changes in our \r\nenvironment. That need is reflected in the new external \r\nrelations strategy adopted by the Hungarian \r\nGovernment at the beginning of this year. Our strategy, \r\npolicies and actions demonstrate our commitment to \r\nupholding the rule of international law, to giving \r\npriority to effective multilateralism, to spreading the \r\nculture of cooperation and the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes, and to working towards \r\npreserving a liveable and sustainable environment for \r\nfuture generations. Hungary’s geographic position and \r\nits expertise in democracy building, good governance, \r\npromoting the rule of law and human rights, \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation will serve as a good \r\nbasis for our effective contribution to the work of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n Skyrocketing energy prices, food and financial \r\ncrises and commodity speculation are endangering the \r\nresults we have attained so far towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). A coherent \r\nand coordinated response is needed to reverse that \r\nprocess. As an emerging donor country, Hungary \r\nfirmly believes that the international community \r\ncannot use the difficulties we all face as an excuse not \r\nto do the utmost to achieve the MDGs. \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 8 \r\n \r\n We are firmly dedicated to broadening the \r\noutreach of our foreign policy to the developing \r\ncountries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. International development cooperation and \r\nassistance are a growing segment of our foreign policy. \r\nWe are strongly committed to intensifying our efforts \r\nin the years to come. We are therefore gradually \r\nincreasing our official development assistance, \r\nconcentrating primarily on those activities where \r\nHungary has comparative advantages, especially in the \r\nareas of agriculture to combat famine and poverty \r\nthrough the introduction of modern growing facilities, \r\nanimal husbandry technologies, forestry and fisheries \r\nprogrammes, water management, developing health \r\nservices and promoting good governance. \r\n Every day we are ruining our environment \r\nthrough the intensive pace of development and the \r\nemission of greenhouse gases. To address that \r\nchallenge, we need a more effective institutional \r\nframework that includes clear political guidance; \r\nadequate, stable and predictable funding; a strong \r\nscientific base; and improved assessment of activities \r\nand emergency response institutions. Hungary fully \r\nagrees that the matter is urgent and hopes that the \r\nongoing deliberations on the future of the United \r\nNations Framework Climate Change Convention and \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol will lead to concrete results in the \r\ncoming year. \r\n This year we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, as well as 15 years of the existence of the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\nOver the past 60 years, humankind has made \r\nextraordinary progress in the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights. Our job is to work hard for the full \r\nimplementation of human rights treaties. Our \r\nexpectations were fulfilled on 3 May of this year when \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities entered into force. Hungary became the \r\nsecond Member State to ratify the Convention and its \r\nOptional Protocol. We hope that it will be universally \r\naccepted in the near future.  \r\n We strongly supported the establishment of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and we are determined to \r\ncontinue to do so. In our view, the time has come for \r\nthe Council, as well as for all of us, to redouble our \r\ndedicated efforts to make the work of the Human \r\nRights Council more efficient.  \r\n Following the adoption of a consensus resolution \r\nby the Council last September, the Forum on Minority \r\nIssues will hold its first session at the end of 2008. I \r\nam personally very proud that the first Forum session \r\nwill be chaired by a fellow Hungarian, \r\nMs. Viktória Mohácsi, a member of the European \r\nParliament. I hope that, under her guidance, the Forum \r\non Minority Issues will be widely recognized, efficient \r\nand results-oriented. \r\n We firmly believe that a lasting solution to \r\ncurrent challenges cannot be achieved without the \r\neffective involvement of women in all aspects of \r\ninternational cooperation. I would like to state that \r\nHungary fully supports the initiative to undertake a \r\ncomprehensive review of the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) by 2010, and I \r\nam confident that the United Nations should play a \r\nleadership role.  \r\n The United Nations and the European Union — \r\ntogether with Governments, non-governmental \r\norganizations and other international organizations \r\naround the world — have made tremendous efforts to \r\npromote international cooperation in the area of the \r\nprevention of genocide and mass atrocities. However, \r\nthe steps taken thus far still fall short of preventing the \r\nmany dreadful crimes against humanity. As a Member \r\nof the United Nations and the European Union, \r\nHungary is fully committed to the idea of preventing \r\ngenocide and is ready to take specific steps to that end. \r\nWe have decided to prepare a feasibility study on the \r\nestablishment in Budapest of an international centre for \r\nthe prevention of genocide and mass atrocities. In our \r\nview, it should be an independent institution with the \r\naim of contributing to international efforts to prevent \r\nthe occurrence of genocide. \r\n The most important outstanding issue in the area \r\nof counter-terrorism, is the full and speedy \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy (see resolution 60/288), for which \r\nMember States have the main responsibility. \r\nConcluding a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism also remains a high priority for \r\nthe Republic of Hungary, and we fully support the \r\nwork of the Ad Hoc Committee in that regard. We hope \r\nthat we will be able to finalize the drafting of a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\nduring the sixty-third session. \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n9 08-53129 \r\n \r\n In spite of the many security and political \r\nchallenges that still persist in Afghanistan, we \r\nacknowledge and appreciate the achievements of the \r\ninternational community and the enormous work that \r\nhas been done so far to bring about tangible \r\nimprovements in the everyday lives of the Afghan \r\npeople. In that process, the United Nations Mission in \r\nAfghanistan remains instrumental, especially in the \r\npreparation and conduct of the upcoming presidential \r\nand parliamentary elections in 2009 and 2010. Hungary \r\nremains committed to helping Afghanistan to rebuild \r\nfollowing many years of war and to create a State that \r\nis safe, stable and democratic. We are committed to \r\ncontinuing our military assistance as a leading nation \r\nin the Provincial Reconstruction Team in the northern \r\npart of the country, as well as to expand our \r\ndevelopment activities in Afghanistan. \r\n Contributing to peace and stability and achieving \r\nprosperity have constituted a cornerstone of Hungarian \r\nforeign policy in the Western Balkans for many years. \r\nWe continue to believe that that goal is best served by \r\nactively supporting the integration of the region into \r\nEuro-Atlantic structures. As we all know, on \r\n17 February, Kosovo declared its independence. A \r\nnumber of United Nations Member States recognized \r\nthat independence, including Hungary. We deem it of \r\ncrucial importance that a resolution of the Kosovo \r\nAssembly and its new constitution fully committed \r\nKosovo to democracy, the rule of law, the protection of \r\nSerb communities and other minorities, the protection \r\nof cultural and religious heritage and the international \r\npresence. Without a stable Kosovo there can be no \r\nstability in the Balkans. In that context, we welcome \r\nand support the continued presence of the international \r\ncommunity on the basis of Security Council resolution \r\n1244 (1999). We also remain committed to contributing \r\nto the stability of Kosovo through the European Union \r\nRule of Law Mission, the International Security Force \r\nin Kosovo and an international civilian office as part of \r\nthe international presence. \r\n Hungary fully supports the efforts of the \r\ninternational community and various institutions to \r\nimplement the peace agreement in Georgia. Hungary \r\nstrongly believes in the peaceful settlement of \r\nconflicts. The use of military force to settle territorial \r\ndisputes represents a dangerous precedent that can \r\nhave further implications in the whole region and \r\nbeyond. Any further steps and negotiations must be \r\nbased on full respect for Georgia’s sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity, internationally recognized borders \r\nand democratically elected leadership. It is of crucial \r\nimportance that all parties agree on a unified \r\ninterpretation of the agreement. We fully support, and \r\nwe are ready to participate in, the planned missions of \r\nthe different international institutions, such as those of \r\nthe EU and the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe, in resolving the conflict and \r\nmonitoring the implementation of the peace agreement. \r\nHungary has offered humanitarian assistance, and we \r\nare studying further possibilities to assist Georgia. \r\n Hungary attaches great importance to the \r\ncomprehensive process initiated at the Annapolis \r\nConference, convened by the President of the United \r\nStates of America, in order to settle the Middle East \r\nconflict. Since Annapolis, there have been regular \r\nmeetings between Israel and the Palestinian National \r\nAuthority. We hope that the peace process will lead to \r\nthe resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the \r\nnormalization of Israeli-Arab relations. \r\n The Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a \r\nmatter of serious concern for my Government. Iran has \r\nfailed to provide the international community with \r\ncredible assurances as to whether its nuclear projects \r\nare in line with its international obligations. We deeply \r\nregret that the leadership of Iran has refused to abide \r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions. Only \r\nfull and unconditional compliance with the demand to \r\nsuspend its enrichment-related and reprocessing \r\nactivities can pave the way for the re-establishment of \r\nconfidence in the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme and open up prospects for intensified \r\neconomic and political cooperation. We hope that Iran \r\nwill change its present course of confrontation and opt \r\nfor constructive dialogue with its partners. \r\n After five years of conflict, Iraq is showing clear \r\nsigns of recovery for the first time. With the help of the \r\ninternational community, Iraq is achieving major \r\nmilestones in the reconciliation and reconstruction \r\nprocess. Hungary welcomes the fact that the improved \r\nsecurity situation allows for the establishment of a \r\nwithdrawal schedule, assuming that a fundamental \r\nchange in the capability of the Iraqi Government to \r\ntake control provides grounds for a long-term \r\nsettlement of the crisis. \r\n Due to the conflict raging in Darfur, which is one \r\nof the most worrisome on the African continent, the \r\nsituation in the Sudan and neighbouring countries is \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 10 \r\n \r\nstill unpredictable and explosive. Hungary welcomes \r\nthe extension of the mandate of African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur until 31 July 2009. \r\nIt is essential that the mission be fully deployed by the \r\nend of the year. The establishment of criminal courts in \r\nthe region paves the way towards a solution of the \r\ncrisis in Darfur. Nevertheless, we should continue to \r\nfollow the fragile peace process closely. \r\n We are convinced that, in order to address the \r\nvarious challenges of the twenty-first century, the \r\ninternational community needs a strong, reformed and \r\nwell-functioning United Nations. Progress has been \r\nmade in all areas of United Nations reform in the past \r\ntwo years, with some new bodies becoming \r\noperational. In other areas we need further \r\nconsultations and negotiations with Member States in \r\norder to achieve a lasting solution. Hungary is ready to \r\ncontribute to those negotiations. We welcome the \r\nrecent decision of the General Assembly to start the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council during the sixty-third session. \r\n In conclusion, Hungary is strongly committed to \r\nwork with you, Mr. President, during the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly in attaining the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kabinga Jacus Pande, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Zambia. \r\n Mr. Pande (Zambia): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation wishes to convey, on behalf of the people \r\nand the Government of the Republic of Zambia, our \r\ndeepest and sincere appreciation and gratitude to \r\nMember States, as well as the United Nations, for the \r\nnumerous messages of condolences we received \r\nfollowing the loss of our beloved President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, State \r\nCouncil, who passed away in Paris, France on \r\n19 August 2008. Their messages of sympathy \r\ncomforted and strengthened us immensely.  \r\n We are particularly indebted to the Government \r\nof Egypt for the medical attention rendered to our late \r\nPresident when he suffered a stroke while attending the \r\nAfrican Union summit in Sharm el-Sheik on 29 June \r\n2008 and for his subsequent evacuation to France. We \r\nare similarly grateful to the Government of France for \r\nthe medical attention and hospitality availed to the late \r\nPresident up to the time of his death as well as for the \r\nrepatriation of his body to Zambia for burial. The \r\nPresident was put to rest on 3 September 2008, which, \r\nincidentally, would have been his sixtieth birthday.  \r\n I wish to inform this Assembly that, in \r\naccordance with the Zambian Constitution, elections \r\nfor the new President should be held within 90 days of \r\nthe death or incapacitation of a sitting President. Thus, \r\nthe Government has designated 30 October 2008 for \r\nthe presidential by-election. In the spirit of \r\ntransparency, accountability and good governance, the \r\nZambian Government has invited international \r\norganizations, including the United Nations, to send \r\nelection observers to the elections. \r\n At this juncture, let me join others who have \r\nspoken before me in congratulating you, Mr. President, \r\non your assumption of the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. Zambia has no \r\ndoubt that you will steer this session to a successful \r\nconclusion. I wish to assure you of Zambia’s support. \r\n May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to \r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, for ably presiding \r\nover the proceedings of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. \r\n I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ntireless efforts in his dedicated service to humankind in \r\ntrying to maintain international peace and security, \r\nachieve development and eradicate poverty for all. \r\n The theme for this session, “The impact of the \r\nglobal food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world \r\nas well as the need to democratize the United Nations”, \r\nis indeed testimony to the noble efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General. The theme is also most appropriate, \r\nespecially since it is relevant to the development \r\nchallenges currently facing Africa and the developing \r\nworld as a whole. \r\n It is confirmed in the Secretary-General’s reports \r\nthat many developing countries, and in particular \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, will not meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and that Member \r\nStates should therefore redouble and reconfirm their \r\ncommitments if we are to meet that target. \r\n Zambia believes that the attainment of the MDGs \r\nwill be meaningful only if it is all-inclusive. That will \r\nrequire the implementation of programmes and policies \r\nfor empowering women, the girl child and other \r\nvulnerable groups of society be part of the overall \r\nprocess within that framework. \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n11 08-53129 \r\n \r\n In that regard, Zambia supports the assertion that \r\nwomen’s empowerment and gender equality are drivers \r\nfor reducing poverty, building food security and \r\nreducing maternal mortality. It is in that realization that \r\nmost of the States members of the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) signed the SADC \r\nProtocol on Gender and Development in \r\nAugust 2008 — the first of its kind in Africa. \r\n Such regional and national efforts need to be \r\ncomplemented by global action. It is in that regard that \r\nZambia welcomes the ongoing debate on reforms in the \r\ncontext of United Nations system-wide coherence, \r\nparticularly as they relate to strengthening the gender \r\narchitecture, which is currently fragmented and \r\nunderresourced. \r\n In the process of empowering women and striving \r\nfor gender equality, Zambia realizes that HIV/AIDS \r\ncontinues to be a challenge to the country’s \r\ndevelopment, with the prevalence rate for women \r\nbeing higher than that of men. The pandemic is robbing \r\nthe country of a young and productive workforce. The \r\nZambian Government therefore has put in place a \r\nnumber of policies that have helped to reduce the \r\nprevalence of HIV from 16 per cent in 2001 to \r\n14 per cent in 2007. That reduction in the prevalence \r\nrate is an indication that our Government is determined \r\nto stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. That would not, \r\nhowever, be possible without the support of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus places obligations on \r\ndeveloped and developing countries alike to come up \r\nwith concrete strategies and action to address poverty. \r\nMost African countries, including Zambia, have \r\nresolved to develop their economies and embarked on \r\nprudent macroeconomic management, channelling \r\nresources to growth sectors that present the greatest \r\nprospect for wealth and employment creation. They \r\nhave further developed policies, plans and programmes \r\nthat are not only growth-oriented but also pro-poor and \r\naddress social development. \r\n I wish to acknowledge with appreciation the role \r\nthat our cooperating partners and the international \r\ncommunity have played and continue to play in all our \r\ndevelopment and poverty-eradication programmes. We \r\nwelcome the commitments made by Africa and its \r\ncooperating partners in the context of various \r\nimportant initiatives and partnerships in recent years, \r\ninter alia, the Tokyo International Conference on \r\nAfrican Development, which among other things, came \r\nup with a Follow-up Mechanism with regard to \r\nimplementation of commitments made during the \r\nconference. \r\n Similarly, the China-Africa Partnership and the \r\nEuropean Union-Africa Strategic Partnership have also \r\ncontributed substantially to Africa’s development \r\nneeds. With regard to the India-Africa Forum, we also \r\nlook forward to the speedy implementation of \r\ncommitments undertaken during the Summit Forum in \r\nIndia in April 2008. \r\n Furthermore, we appreciate the assistance \r\nrendered by the G-8 Africa Partnership, the Emergency \r\nPlan for AIDS Relief of the President of the United \r\nStates of America, the comprehensive health-care \r\ninitiative sponsored by the Government of Cuba, the \r\nInitiative for Africa’s Development of the Republic of \r\nKorea and Pakistan’s Special Technical Assistance \r\nProgramme for Africa. In similar vein, we look forward \r\nto the implementation of the recently launched Africa-\r\nTurkey partnership forum. \r\n Zambia notes with concern, however, that the \r\nefforts the cooperating partners are making with regard \r\nto improved access to the markets of the developed \r\ncountries and official development assistance flows \r\nand finance for development for African countries have \r\nnot been completely fulfilled. We commend the five \r\ncooperating partners that have met or exceeded the \r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of their gross national income as \r\ntheir contribution to official development assistance. \r\nWe urge the cooperating partners that have not fulfilled \r\ntheir commitments to do so. We also look forward to \r\nthe upcoming Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development to Review the \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus in Doha \r\nand hope donors will honour their commitments. \r\n We are aware that improved market access for \r\ndeveloping countries is one commitment that, once \r\nfulfilled, will offer the greatest prospects for our \r\nintegration into the world trading system. It also has \r\nthe potential to foster food security for all and to raise \r\nthe standard of living of the majority of the population \r\nthat depends on agriculture for its livelihood.  \r\n In that regard, Zambia notes with disappointment \r\nthat the Doha Round of trade negotiations collapsed at \r\na time when many of us were looking forward to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion to those protracted talks. It is my \r\ncountry’s hope that the negotiations will reconvene and \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 12 \r\n \r\nconclude as soon as possible so that the developing \r\ncountries can compete favourably and become \r\nintegrated into the multilateral trading system. \r\n The current global oil and food crises not only \r\npose a threat to the gains made in achieving \r\nmacroeconomic stability and growth in developing \r\ncountries, but are an even greater threat to the \r\nachievements made towards eliminating extreme \r\npoverty and reducing by half the proportion of people \r\nsuffering from hunger. \r\n A solution to the food crisis must be found as a \r\nmatter of urgency. In that connection, Zambia wishes \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for establishing the \r\nHigh-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security \r\nCrisis, whose task is to find a coherent and coordinated \r\napproach to resolving the food crisis. In addressing the \r\ncrisis, we must be mindful of the fact that a large \r\npercentage of the people in developing countries \r\ndepend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Therefore, \r\nin finding a solution to high food prices, we should \r\nensure that we do not inadvertently encourage rural-\r\nurban migration by including measures that are \r\ndisadvantageous to those engaged in food and general \r\nagricultural production. \r\n In addition, the issue of climate change, which \r\nhas worsened the food crisis, requires the concerted \r\nefforts of the international community to address it \r\nthrough the development of adaptation and mitigation \r\nmeasures. Zambia, like most of sub-Saharan Africa, \r\nhas not been spared the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, such as increased exposure to drought, rising \r\ntemperatures, more erratic rainfall and extreme weather \r\nconditions. Those are threatening water and \r\nagricultural systems, thereby condemning millions \r\nmore to face malnutrition and water shortages. \r\n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Let me now turn to the ongoing reforms of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular the protracted discussions \r\non reform of the Security Council. Zambia wishes to \r\nreiterate the fact that United Nations reform will not be \r\ncomplete without meaningful reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. Any new proposals to reform the Council \r\nshould take into account Africa’s call for two \r\npermanent seats with the veto power and two \r\nadditional non-permanent seats, as that will not only \r\naddress the historical injustice against Africa, but also \r\nrespond to the need to democratize the Security \r\nCouncil, given that Africa constitutes the second-\r\nlargest bloc of the United Nations membership. \r\nEqually important in that regard will be the need to \r\nreform the working methods of that important United \r\nNations body. \r\n It is a matter of concern to Zambia that the \r\nquestion of Western Sahara has remained unresolved \r\nfor such a long time. In accordance with the principles \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and General \r\nAssembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, \r\nthe people of Western Sahara should be free to exercise \r\ntheir inalienable right to self-determination. In that \r\nregard, Zambia calls for the implementation of all \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions on that matter, \r\nwhile supporting the ongoing efforts between the \r\nparties concerned to find a lasting solution. \r\n With regard to the situation in Zimbabwe, Zambia \r\nwelcomes the signing of the Inter-Party Agreement on \r\n15 September 2008 and pays tribute to former South \r\nAfrican President Thabo Mbeki, who, on behalf of \r\nSADC, successfully discharged the mandate entrusted \r\nto him. We remain optimistic that the concerned parties \r\nwill adhere to the Agreement, which has created a good \r\nbasis for addressing the socio-economic problems \r\nconfronting the country. In that regard, we appeal to \r\nthe international community to provide all possible \r\nsupport to the people of Zimbabwe in their efforts to \r\nresuscitate their economy. \r\n There is no doubt that the United Nations remains \r\nthe only multilateral institution capable of addressing \r\nthe challenges of our one world. The world’s poor are \r\nlooking to the United Nations system to deliver on its \r\ncommitments to enable them to live in dignity with \r\nevery possible opportunity, free from hunger and \r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS and, above all, in a \r\npeaceful, secure and environmentally sustainable \r\nworld. Let us therefore not fail them, for they deserve \r\nno less. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mohlabi Tsekoa, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and International Relations of the Kingdom of \r\nLesotho. \r\n Mr. Tsekoa (Lesotho): My delegation associates \r\nitself with the compliments extended to Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at the present session, to his \r\npredecessor and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n13 08-53129 \r\n \r\n We greatly welcome the convening and the \r\noutcomes of the two high-level meetings — one on \r\nAfrica’s development needs and the other on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals — that have been held \r\nduring the course of this session of the General \r\nAssembly. Let us not lose the momentum generated by \r\nthose two meetings. \r\n Let me also thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for advancing a very appropriate theme, \r\n“The impact of the global food crisis on poverty and \r\nhunger in the world as well as the need to democratize \r\nthe United Nations”. The decision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to establish the High-Level Task Force on the \r\nGlobal Food Security Crisis demonstrates the \r\ndetermination of the United Nations to champion a \r\nunified response to the current food crisis. That is \r\nindeed emboldening, and we welcome the progress that \r\nhas been achieved so far by the Task Force in \r\nproducing the Comprehensive Framework for Action.  \r\n The food crisis poses a serious threat to the \r\nfragile progress that is being made towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It \r\ncan also be a source of political instability in \r\ndeveloping and often vulnerable countries. Policy \r\ninitiatives that should be implemented by relevant \r\nstakeholders to overcome the crisis were adequately \r\narticulated in the outcome documents of the High-\r\nLevel Conference on World Food Security: the \r\nChallenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy, held in \r\nRome in June 2008. There, the bottom line was clearly \r\ndrawn that, while current energy needs are real and \r\nurgent, they cannot and should not be allowed to \r\ncompete with the call to ensure food security. The \r\nstakes are too high in many developing countries, \r\nLesotho included, where abject poverty, malnutrition \r\nand the spread of HIV and AIDS have reached \r\nunacceptable levels. All humankind has a right to food, \r\nand hunger constitutes a violation of human dignity. \r\n That is why my delegation regrets the lack of \r\nprogress in the implementation of previous \r\ninternational commitments to fight hunger, particularly \r\nthose contained in the outcomes of the 1996 and the \r\n2002 World Food Summits. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal (MDG) of reducing by half the \r\nnumber of undernourished people by 2015 will not be \r\nachieved unless there is visible movement from \r\nrhetoric to action. \r\n Lesotho was encouraged by the G8 Statement on \r\nGlobal Food Security that was recently issued at the \r\nHokkaido Toyako summit. The Statement highlighted \r\nthe importance of stimulating world food production \r\nand of increasing investments in agriculture. Hope-\r\nraising pledges were made at that summit and earlier \r\nones. What remains to be done as a matter of great \r\nurgency is to deliver on those promises. Also, we call \r\nupon other development partners, including the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions, to scale up their efforts to help \r\nfarmers in the least developed countries, particularly in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, to raise agricultural production and \r\nproductivity. \r\n The preparedness of the African continent to \r\nshoulder its responsibilities in this regard was clearly \r\nreflected in a declaration entitled “Responding to the \r\nChallenges of High Food Prices and Agriculture \r\nDevelopment” that was recently adopted at the African \r\nUnion summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in July this \r\nyear. \r\n The establishment by the World Bank of two \r\ninternational Climate Investment Funds in May 2008, \r\nintended to provide innovative financing for \r\ndeveloping countries to pursue cleaner development \r\npaths and also to help protect themselves from the \r\nimpact of climate change, was another encouraging \r\ndevelopment. Our hope is that the Climate Investment \r\nFunds will be additional to existing official \r\ndevelopment assistance, which is so sorely needed by \r\nthe developing countries to achieve the MDGs. \r\n Peace and development are closely interrelated \r\nand mutually reinforcing. The United Nations cannot \r\nafford the luxury of complacency in its mandate for the \r\nmaintenance of world peace and stability. Most \r\nimportantly, let us not forget that the United Nations \r\nwas born from the ashes of devastating world wars. \r\nIndeed, the primary purpose of the United Nations was \r\nand continues to be to prevent future wars and to create \r\nsustainable international security, but every year we \r\nwitness the emergence of new hotspots and designer \r\nwars as some big and powerful States resort more and \r\nmore to the use of force. Every time those States try to \r\npursue the illusory goal of imposing their will by force \r\non others, they create a more unstable and dangerous \r\nworld. \r\n Let me now address an issue of concern to my \r\ndelegation — the abuse of the principle of universal \r\njurisdiction. The Sharm el-Sheikh assembly of the \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 14 \r\n \r\nAfrican Union was seized with the issue of the abuse \r\nof the principle of universal jurisdiction by some \r\ncountries that seem inclined to use the principle to \r\ntarget certain African leaders. \r\n Of course, lest I be misunderstood, we do \r\nrecognize that universal jurisdiction is a principle of \r\ninternational law whose purpose is to ensure that \r\nindividuals who commit such grave offences as \r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are \r\nbrought to justice. That noble principle should be \r\nimpartially and objectively applied so that it will not be \r\nabused for the political ends of some individuals or \r\ncountries, as that could endanger international order \r\nand security. \r\n It is a trite fact that the need for the application of \r\nthe principle by individual States has been rendered \r\nunnecessary by the creation of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). If a State is unable or unwilling \r\nto deal with certain grave situations, such a matter \r\nshould be referred to the Court, which will deal with it \r\nimpartially. As we know, even the Security Council \r\nrefers certain situations to the ICC. We need only \r\nemphasize that the ICC was created by this world body \r\nand must enjoy the support and trust of the entire \r\nmembership of the United Nations. It must also be \r\nimmune from any external influences. \r\n As we respond to the invitation to comment on \r\nthe second part of our theme, “The need to democratize \r\nthe United Nations”, we do so against the background \r\nof the integrity and credibility of the Security Council. \r\nWe raise the issue of the integrity and credibility of the \r\nCouncil, recognizing fully its responsibility to uphold \r\nthe three pillars of the United Nations: human rights, \r\ndevelopment and peace, and security. \r\n The working methods of the Security Council \r\ncontinue to interest us precisely because the Council is \r\nthe most powerful institution within the United Nations \r\nsetting. It is charged with the responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of world peace and order and it is a \r\ncustodian of human rights. In order to fulfil that \r\nmandate, the Security Council needs to always \r\npreserve its integrity and credibility. It is only when all \r\nMember States are convinced of its integrity and \r\ncredibility that they will have confidence in it. \r\n The Security Council can enjoy such confidence, \r\nhowever, if and only if it is seen to be transparent and \r\ndemocratic in its structures and accountable and \r\nresponsible to the entire membership of the United \r\nNations; if and only if it submits itself to the rule of \r\nlaw; if and only if it is objective and impartial in its \r\nwork; if and only if the membership of the United \r\nNations is convinced that it is not used as a policy \r\ninstrument of any one State or group of States; and \r\nfinally, if and only if it subjects all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations to the same and equal treatment. \r\n The Security Council should thus not turn a blind \r\neye to a situation in one country and then act when a \r\nsimilar situation obtains in another. It must be an \r\nhonest arbiter in conflicts. We all owe it to ourselves to \r\nwork towards such reform of the Security Council that \r\nwill help to preserve its integrity and credibility so that \r\nit can perform its lofty mandate more efficiently. \r\nNeedless to say, the question of numbers, particularly \r\nnumbers representing the African continent, is at issue, \r\nbut I need not dwell on it as it has been amply covered \r\nby previous speakers. \r\n Lesotho is also concerned that the Security \r\nCouncil continues to be seen to be encroaching on \r\nmatters that fall within the powers and prerogatives of \r\nother organs of the United Nations, including the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We believe that the Council must \r\ndesist from assuming the legislative role of the General \r\nAssembly and from adopting binding resolutions that \r\ndictate domestic law for Member States. In some \r\ninstances, the Council has sought to interfere in purely \r\ninternal political matters that do not pose a threat to \r\ninternational peace and that, in any case, are being \r\ndealt with at the regional level. In our view, the \r\nusurpation by the Council of the mandates of other \r\norgans, including the Assembly, is not justifiable. \r\n A few days ago, we witnessed a positive \r\ndevelopment in the southern Africa subregion when the \r\nleaders of the people of Zimbabwe put aside their \r\npolitical differences and joined hands to form a \r\nGovernment of national unity. We congratulate the \r\npeople of Zimbabwe on that historic feat. We urge the \r\ninternational community to support the people of \r\nZimbabwe in rebuilding their economy and in \r\ndetermining their destiny in an atmosphere of national \r\nharmony and peace. We also urge the leadership of \r\nZimbabwe to ensure adherence to the principles of \r\ndemocracy, respect for human rights and the rule of \r\nlaw, as such adherence will have a catalytic effect on \r\nsocio-economic initiatives in which Zimbabwe is \r\ninvolved. \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n15 08-53129 \r\n \r\n Finally, we urge the Security Council to support \r\nefforts to bring to an end the unilateral economic and \r\nfinancial embargo that has, for decades now, been \r\nimposed against Cuba. We further urge the Council to \r\nintervene more decisively on behalf of the people of \r\nPalestine and Western Sahara, who have, also for \r\ndecades, been denied the right to self-determination.  \r\n Lesotho is supportive of any efforts that will \r\nbring about lasting and sustainable peace in the Middle \r\nEast and in other conflict areas in Africa, the Balkans \r\nand around our globe. We recall that in his report “In \r\nlarger freedom: towards development, security and \r\nhuman rights for all”, former Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan said: “Our guiding light must be the needs and \r\nhopes of peoples everywhere” (A/59/2005, para. 12). \r\n Such is the call and challenge staring the United \r\nNations in the face: to ensure a peaceful, safe, \r\ndignified and prosperous world in our time and for \r\nposterity. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hassan Wirajuda, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Wirajuda (Indonesia): May I first \r\ncongratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-third session. I am sure that he will lead our \r\ndeliberations with great wisdom and skill. I also wish \r\nto congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for \r\nably guiding our sixty-second session. \r\n It is timely and wise that we focus our \r\ndeliberations on the global food crisis and on the \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations. While those \r\ntwo issues appear to be vastly different, they have \r\nmore to do with each other than meets the eye. For \r\ndemocracy means nothing if a part of humankind is \r\nwell fed while a larger part of it goes to bed hungry \r\nevery night. Human equality is a mirage in any country \r\nwhere a part of the population struggles against obesity \r\nwhile a larger part of it wonders where the next meal is \r\ncoming from. \r\n I do not exaggerate. According to the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, food \r\nprices will remain high for the next three to five years. \r\nRice stocks are falling to their lowest level since the \r\nmid-1970s. Wheat stocks are sinking to their lowest \r\nsince 1948. Compounding the situation is the explosive \r\ngrowth of the world population. \r\n There is a huge unfilled demand for food. Food \r\nriots have already erupted in parts of the Middle East, \r\nAfrica, Asia and the Caribbean. In 33 countries, \r\nespecially those with fragile States, there is a real and \r\npresent danger of social and political unrest because \r\npeople are hungry. We must vigorously address the \r\nproblem of global food insecurity. Otherwise, peace is \r\nat risk in the developing world and in pockets of \r\npoverty in the developed world. What the world needs \r\ntoday is a new Green Revolution — a Green \r\nRevolution that this time embraces the entire \r\ndeveloping world, especially Africa. Developing \r\ncountries must now put agriculture, especially food \r\nproduction, back into the core of their development \r\nagenda. For their part, the developed countries must \r\nput agriculture and food production into the core of \r\ntheir trade and aid programmes. \r\n In that regard, the experience of Indonesia may \r\nbe instructive. It is not easy to feed a population of 230 \r\nmillion, the fourth largest in the world, but there are no \r\nfood riots in Indonesia. Last year, we had a surplus \r\nproduction of rice. We used that surplus to bolster our \r\nnational stockpile. That has contributed to national \r\nstability. This year, we expect another surplus of 5 per \r\ncent, which brings production to 36 million tons. We \r\nare going to export part of that as our contribution to \r\nglobal food security. \r\n We can do that because we have vastly improved \r\nour rice productivity by providing our farmers with \r\nmicrofinancing, improved seed varieties, cheap but \r\nappropriate farm technology and affordable fertilizers. \r\nWe have thus developed some experience and expertise \r\nthat worked for us and can work in other developing \r\ncountries. We will continue to share those in the spirit \r\nof South-South cooperation. \r\n Food security is a cause in which everyone must \r\nbe involved. In that light, I firmly believe that this \r\nGeneral Assembly of ours is called upon to take a \r\nnumber of concrete measures.  \r\n First, we can task the World Bank and the \r\nrelevant United Nations bodies to develop ways and \r\nmeans of helping national Governments to spend more \r\non agriculture and on rural infrastructures to empower \r\nsmall farmers. \r\n Secondly, let us ensure that the appropriate \r\nUnited Nations bodies link up with regional \r\nmechanisms for food security, such as common food \r\nreserves and early warning systems on regional food \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 16 \r\n \r\ncrises. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has \r\nsuch an arrangement and so do other regional \r\narrangements. The United Nations can serve as the \r\nhub, while the regional arrangements serve as the \r\nspokes of a global wheel for food security. \r\n Thirdly, let us establish the framework for a \r\nglobal partnership on food security. We should ensure \r\nthat the World Trade Organization Doha development \r\nnegotiations reach a conclusion that supports increased \r\nfood production. Let us make use of the forthcoming \r\nreview of the Monterrey Consensus on financing for \r\ndevelopment as an opportunity to devise ways to fund \r\nthe Green Revolution. \r\n Let us be mindful, however, that agriculture does \r\nnot always lead to a food harvest. It is even possible \r\nthat an imprudent rush to produce biofuels will lead to \r\na severe reduction of the food supply. It is true that by \r\nswitching from fossil fuels to biofuels, we can cushion \r\nthe impact of the skyrocketing of the world price of oil \r\nand thereby address the energy crisis. It is also true \r\nthat, by making that switch in fuels, we reduce \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions and thereby address the \r\nchallenge of climate change.  \r\n It would be unwise and reckless, however, to \r\naddress two crises by aggravating a third. We cannot \r\nallay the energy crisis and the crisis of global warming \r\nby deepening the global food crisis. That will only \r\nworsen the plight of humankind, but we can carry out a \r\nbroad range of rational and coordinated policies and \r\ninitiatives that address those crises systemically. We \r\ncan address the energy crisis by developing all \r\nalternative sources of available energy, which will help \r\nmitigate global warming. \r\n Moreover, in the next 16 months we can advance \r\nthe climate change agenda through the Bali Road Map, \r\nall the way from Bali to Copenhagen through Poznan. \r\nIndonesia is fully committed to that process. After \r\nhosting the Bali conference that produced the Road \r\nMap, we have joined the troika of host countries to \r\ngive the process a push among world leaders. By 2009, \r\nwe should produce an ambitious post-2012 global \r\nclimate regime that will contain global warming to \r\nwithin two degrees Celsius in the next 20 years. But \r\neven before the process is concluded in Copenhagen, \r\nwe in Indonesia are partnering with other countries to \r\nenhance our topical forests and coral reefs in an effort \r\nto reduce carbon emissions. \r\n Even as we face the challenge of global warming \r\nin the physical world, we must also deal with the \r\nreality of a global chill in the politico-security field. \r\nSymptoms of that chill are the military tensions that \r\nhave arisen in Eastern Europe. \r\n There is also a new arms race. There is more \r\nmilitary spending now than there was at the end of the \r\ncold war. Moreover, the conflicts and tensions of a year \r\nago are still with us. The dream of establishing a \r\nPalestinian State by the end of this year has virtually \r\ncrumbled. The Iraqi and Afghan conflicts keep raging \r\non. North Korea, the subject of so much uncertainty \r\ntoday, is backsliding from its commitment to dismantle \r\nits nuclear weapons programme. The nuclear issue in \r\nIran remains unresolved.  \r\n In the face of those conflicts and tensions, the \r\nSecurity Council should have been more decisive. That \r\nthe Council has failed to resolve them is a cause for \r\nconcern. Of the issues that the Council has failed to \r\nresolve, two are of great concern to Indonesia, namely, \r\nthose recent cases that directly infringe on the principle \r\nof the territorial integrity and political independence of \r\nStates, both involving external intervention that led to \r\nthe secession of a part or parts of a State. Both cases \r\ninvolved major Powers. \r\n It is of the greatest importance to Indonesia and, I \r\nbelieve, to many developing countries that those recent \r\ncases do not set an ill-advised and dangerous \r\nprecedent. Developing countries in the midst of nation-\r\nbuilding and State-building would be extremely \r\nvulnerable to such precedents. The danger is that it \r\ntakes only one misstep to kill principles that have been \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, such as \r\nthe principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nof States. If we kill those principles, we have killed the \r\nideal that holds the United Nations together. \r\n The sovereignty of States must be preserved if \r\nthere is to be a democratic spirit in international \r\nrelations. That idea is essential because, without \r\ndemocracy, a world organization like the United \r\nNations cannot be effective. Indeed, the failure of the \r\nSecurity Council to come to grips with recent \r\nchallenges to global security is due largely to the fact \r\nthat it is not democratic enough. \r\n To make the Council more democratic, the use of \r\nthe veto power of the permanent five must be \r\nregulated. The misuse of the veto by any one \r\npermanent member should no longer be allowed to \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n17 08-53129 \r\n \r\nparalyse the entire Council. Democratization of the \r\nCouncil also means an equitable distribution of its \r\nmembership, not only in terms of geographical \r\nrepresentation, where we already have imbalances, but \r\nalso in terms of constituencies. Hence, the world’s \r\nmajor civilizations should be proportionately \r\nrepresented. The world’s community of 1.1 billion \r\nMuslims must be represented on the Council if it is to \r\nbe truly democratic. \r\n The need for democratization is also deeply felt \r\nat the regional level. In the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), I am pleased to say, we have \r\nresponded to that need. The cause of democracy is \r\ngaining ground in the region as we transform ASEAN \r\nfrom a loose association into a true community that is \r\nfirmly committed to the promotion of democracy and \r\nhuman rights. All members, without exception, \r\nstrongly share that commitment. \r\n It is in that spirit that Indonesia is launching the \r\nBali Democracy Forum this December. It will be not an \r\nexclusive forum among democracies, but an inclusive \r\nand open forum for the countries of Asia to share their \r\nexperiences and best practices in fostering democracy. \r\nA true democracy is always homegrown; it is never \r\nanything that is imposed from outside. \r\n Meanwhile, we in Indonesia continue to tend to \r\nour young democracy. We are seeing to it that \r\ndemocracy takes root, not only by holding free \r\nelections, but also by working hard to provide good \r\ngovernance, to sustain a system of checks and balances \r\namong the three branches of Government, and to \r\nstrengthen the roles of the mass media and civil society \r\nin our national life. Thus we pursue the democratic \r\nideal: democracy at the level of the United Nations, \r\ndemocracy at the regional level and democracy within \r\nthe nation. \r\n At each of those levels, we hope to see nations \r\nand people taking control of their lives and taking part \r\nin the decision-making processes that shape their \r\nfuture. The realization of that ideal will give full \r\nmeaning to the first three words of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Indeed, “We the peoples” is what \r\ndemocracy is all about. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Franck Bianchéri, Government \r\nCouncillor for External Relations and for International \r\nEconomic and Financial Affairs of Monaco. \r\n Mr. Bianchéri (Monaco) (spoke in French): \r\nAllow me at the outset to convey to the President my \r\ncongratulations on his election and to acknowledge, \r\nthrough him, the Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nthat made his presidency of the General Assembly \r\npossible. Let me assure him and the other Assembly \r\nofficers that my delegation will support them \r\nthroughout the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nresolute action in favour of peace and reiterate to him \r\nour sincere and full support. \r\n Finally, allow me to state what a great honour it \r\nis for me to take the floor today for the first time at the \r\nrostrum of this prestigious Hall. \r\n The great and deeply missed poet Aimé Césaire \r\nsaid: “A civilization that is unable to resolve the \r\nproblems that beset it is a decadent civilization.” We \r\nknow what the sufferings of our civilization are. We \r\nhave identified the solutions needed to treat them. The \r\nissue at stake here is implementing those solutions. \r\n Eight years ago, in this very Hall, all the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations adopted the \r\nMillennium Declaration, the decisive tool in the fight \r\nagainst poverty, to promote peace, security and human \r\nrights, and to ensure a sustainable environment. It \r\nprovided the framework for eight precise goals \r\naccompanied by clear time frames — the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n My message today is a simple one. The \r\ninternational community cannot afford to fail in the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs, in spite of the threefold \r\nfood, energy and environmental crisis seriously \r\naffecting the whole planet. To achieve the goals that we \r\nset ourselves at the dawn of the new millennium, we \r\nwill have to step up our efforts and pursue concerted \r\naction in the only universal forum we have — the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Eight years ago, we drew up together a scorecard \r\nwith quantified goals and defined the steps to be taken \r\nto reduce poverty, fight hunger in the world and \r\ncombat pandemics. Eight years ago, the situation was \r\nvery alarming; we could not have imagined that things \r\nwere to get worse.  \r\n Since then, we have been faced with the energy \r\ncrisis and increasingly scarce resources, the food crisis \r\nand soaring prices of basic food products, and the \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 18 \r\n \r\nclimate crisis resulting from the impact of human \r\nactivities on the environment. Adding to that already \r\nvery dark picture, we must now face the financial \r\ncrisis, whose repercussions continue to be felt and \r\nwhose full impact is yet to be seen.  \r\n Each country is suffering the consequences of \r\nthose crises in a different way depending on its \r\ngeography, its economy and its commercial and \r\nfinancial market exposure; and each country is \r\nattempting to face them with its own means. The \r\nPrincipality of Monaco, within its capabilities, has \r\nchosen to fight two of those crises — the food crisis \r\nand the climate crisis — with the resources at its \r\ndisposal. \r\n Much of the progress achieved in recent years in \r\nhelping those populations suffering from hunger and \r\nmalnutrition has been erased by soaring increases in \r\nthe price of basic foodstuffs. Two billion human beings \r\nare seriously at risk even as world cereal production \r\nhas reached a record high in 2008. The African \r\ncontinent, and in particular sub-Saharan Africa, with \r\n60 per cent of its population affected by the crisis, is \r\nonce again the worst-affected continent. \r\n It remains nonetheless undeniable that the right to \r\nfood is among the basic human rights. During the \r\nHigh-Level Conference in Rome last June, the \r\ninternational community adopted the Declaration on \r\nWorld Food Security: the Challenges of Climate \r\nChange and Bioenergy. Monaco fully supports the \r\nmeasures advocated in the Declaration and joins the \r\ncall for the establishment of a world partnership \r\ncentred on the High-Level Task Force on the Global \r\nFood Security Crisis. \r\n A year ago, His Serene Highness Prince Albert II \r\nannounced here his decision to substantially increase \r\nMonaco’s official development assistance (ODA). The \r\nPrincipality’s Government is sparing no effort to reach \r\nthe target of allocating 0.7 per cent of its gross national \r\nincome by 2015 by increasing our ODA by 25 per cent \r\nevery year and focusing its actions on the least \r\ndeveloped countries.  \r\n In 2008, 22 countries, mainly located around the \r\nMediterranean basin and in sub-Saharan Africa, have \r\nbenefited from a development partnership with the \r\nPrincipality. In addition to that bilateral cooperation, \r\nMonaco contributes on a regular basis to large-scale \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system, such as the \r\nWorld Food Programme, the United Nations Children’s \r\nFund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization, the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund, whose expertise and \r\nstructures facilitate the greatest assistance to the \r\npoorest populations. \r\n Moreover, climate change and the imbalances it \r\ncreates have a direct impact on the sustainability of our \r\nactions for development. The climate crisis, \r\ndesertification and the shortage of water resources have \r\nexacerbated the food crisis.  \r\n Antoine de Saint Exupéry said: “We do not \r\ninherit the Earth from our parents; we borrow it from \r\nour children.” Pursuing that analogy, the international \r\ncommunity is not allocating sufficient funds to repay \r\nthat loan. \r\n Under the leadership of our Head of State and in \r\ncollaboration with the Prince Albert II Foundation, the \r\nGovernment has committed itself actively in the \r\nInternational Polar Year to raise awareness among as \r\nmany people as possible of the consequences of global \r\nwarming. In that regard, the Arctic ice cap deserves all \r\nour attention since it serves as both an indicator of the \r\nconsequences of global warming and as a vector of \r\nclimate change through its gradual disappearance. \r\n Last year, when adopting the resolution on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea, member States expressed their \r\ndeep concern over the vulnerability of the environment \r\nand the fragility of ecosystems of the polar regions, \r\nparticularly the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic ice cap. At \r\nMonaco’s initiative, the decision on sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the Arctic region was adopted at the \r\ntenth special session of the Governing Council of the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, which was \r\nheld in the Principality in February 2008. \r\n We will pursue our commitment to that cause in \r\nthe coming months when Monaco will host meetings \r\non the Arctic: the first in November 2008, organized by \r\nthe French presidency of the European Union, and the \r\nsecond organized by UNESCO early next year. I would \r\nalso note that the Principality has solemnly confirmed \r\nits interest in the polar regions by acceding to the \r\nAntarctic Treaty on 31 May, and that His Serene \r\nHighness Prince Albert II will join a scientific mission \r\nto Antarctica in January. \r\n Notwithstanding the obstacles we have \r\nencountered on the road since 2000, we have to stay on \r\ntrack. Indeed, let us roll up our sleeves, consult each \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n19 08-53129 \r\n \r\nother and work together to multiply our forces and \r\ncreate genuine synergy. \r\n I would like to reiterate here the deep \r\ncommitment of the Principality of Monaco to the \r\nUnited Nations, the only genuinely universal \r\norganization, which has human rights and the \r\npromotion of dialogue among nations at its very core. \r\nThe Charter of the United Nations guarantees the \r\nsovereign equality of States and the rule of law. \r\nMonaco has been a Member of the United Nations for \r\n15 years. Since joining, our small Principality has \r\ncovered a lot of ground on the international scene, \r\nbecoming a member of the Council of Europe in 2004 \r\nand, very recently, joining the Union for the \r\nMediterranean. \r\n Without the United Nations, it is doubtful that \r\nhuman rights would have acquired their universal \r\nstatus, which today is indisputable. This year and next, \r\nmany anniversaries remind us yet again of the essential \r\nrole of the United Nations: the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the \r\nDeclaration of the Rights of the Child, and the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child. \r\n The world has changed since the San Francisco \r\nConference. Today, our task is to modernize the United \r\nNations and ensure that its institutions adequately \r\nreflect our democratic principles and new geopolitical \r\nbalances. As His Serene Highness Prince Albert II \r\nstated here last year, Monaco supports the expansion of \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n Only the combined efforts of all partners will \r\nallow us to make real progress in the fight against \r\npoverty, to promote health care and education, improve \r\naccess to water and protect the environment. As \r\nindicated in the June 2008 recommendations of the \r\nMDG Africa Steering Group, the primary responsibility \r\nfor achieving the MDGs remains with African \r\nGovernments, which have shown tremendous \r\nleadership in recent years and launched ambitious \r\nprogrammes to attract the financial support of their \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\n We have seen real progress since 2000, in \r\nparticular in the area of health. Monaco, for its part, \r\ncontributes to various WHO and UNICEF programmes \r\nand participates in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, sickle \r\ncell anaemia, tuberculosis and malaria. However, the \r\ngreatest national efforts, if made on an individual basis \r\nand without coordination, will not be enough to fight \r\nthe scourges that affect our planet, and the African \r\ncontinent in particular. \r\n The evaluation of ODA policies, the sharing of \r\ngood practices, the coordination of development \r\nassistance, partnership with the private sector, \r\nmicrofinance and the pursuit of alternative revenue \r\nsources are all instruments that, together with the \r\npriority to be given to the central role of women in the \r\neconomy, will enable us to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in the next seven years. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Vladimir Norov, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan. \r\n Mr. Norov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and \r\nwish him every success in his work. \r\n In the context of the agenda of the current session \r\nof the General Assembly, I would like to address the \r\nfollowing issues, which we consider to be of the \r\nutmost importance and are directly relevant to the \r\nsecurity and sustainable development of the Central \r\nAsian region. \r\n First are the issues related to the continuing \r\nintensification and escalation of confrontation in \r\nAfghanistan, the increasing radicalization of the \r\nsituation and the provocative terrorist statements by the \r\nfighters. Despite the enormous efforts and measures by \r\nthe international community and coalition forces to \r\nsupport peace in Afghanistan, the situation, \r\nunfortunately, is deteriorating. The civilians are \r\nperishing. \r\n What further exacerbates the situation in \r\nAfghanistan is the growing volume of drug trafficking. \r\nToday the production of opium in Afghanistan accounts \r\nfor more than 8,000 tons, or over 90 percent of global \r\nproduction. It must be taken into consideration that \r\ndrug trafficking is becoming one of the important \r\nsources of financing for fighters, destabilizing the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan itself and in neighbouring \r\nStates. \r\n From this high rostrum, I would like to state \r\nagain that we are deeply convinced that recent \r\ndevelopments in the situation in Afghanistan show ever \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 20 \r\n \r\nmore clearly that the Afghan problem cannot be \r\nresolved by the use of armed force, military means and \r\nincreasing militarization alone. The war, which has \r\nbeen ongoing for close to 30 years, has destroyed both \r\nthe economic and social infrastructure, led to the \r\nimpoverishment of the population and, we must admit, \r\nhas deprived people of any belief in a future and has \r\nprovided fertile ground for recruiting more and more \r\nfighters. \r\n The developing situation dictates the need to \r\nradically reconsider the approaches to resolving the \r\nAfghan problem. It is our firm belief that our main \r\npriorities must be providing targeted economic aid to \r\nAfghanistan, building and moulding economic and \r\nsocial infrastructure, ensuring employment \r\nopportunities and resolving the acute problem of \r\ncombating poverty. \r\n It is necessary to do everything we can to ensure \r\nrespectful attitudes to national and religious values and \r\nthe centuries-old traditions and customs of the \r\nmultinational and multi-faith people of Afghanistan, \r\nand on that basis to bring together the conflicting \r\nforces. An important instrument for achieving such \r\ngoals could be a return to the successful Six plus Two \r\ngroup on Afghanistan that successfully functioned in \r\nthe middle of the 1990s under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations and transforming it into a Six plus \r\nThree group by taking into consideration contemporary \r\nrealities and including in its make-up neighbouring \r\nStates, Russia and the United States, and NATO. \r\n As the President of Uzbekistan, Mr. Islam \r\nKarimov, has repeatedly underscored, the realization of \r\nsuch an initiative — which has already been called for \r\nfrom a number of international rostrums — could be a \r\nworthy alternative in achieving peace, stability and the \r\nrevival of Afghanistan. \r\n The outcomes of the high-level event on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals that took place on \r\n25 September 2008 demonstrated that the international \r\ncommunity needs to resolutely seek concrete results in \r\nachieving the goals in the sphere of development as \r\nformulated in the Millennium Declaration. \r\n In that context, all of us share responsibility for \r\nthe reasonable use of natural resources, including the \r\ntransboundary rivers in Central Asia. Experience itself \r\nhas shown that disregarding well-known United \r\nNations declarations and international standards on the \r\njoint use of water resources of transboundary rivers can \r\nlead to very serious and at times tragic ecological \r\ndisasters, as borne out by the ongoing catastrophe of \r\nthe drying up of the Aral Sea, with all of its unforeseen \r\nconsequences for the tens of millions of people in the \r\nregion. \r\n According to the fundamental provisions of \r\nUnited Nations conventions, all decisions on the use of \r\nthe water of transboundary rivers in Central Asia, \r\nincluding the construction of hydropower facilities, \r\nmust in no way inflict damage on the ecology of the \r\nregion or infringe on the interests of the populations of \r\nneighbouring countries, nor should they upset the \r\nestablished balanced use of the water of transboundary \r\nrivers by all States in those rivers basins. In the case of \r\ndamage, all measures must be taken to remove or \r\nmitigate such damage, and, if necessary, the issue of \r\ncompensation must be raised. \r\n We are convinced that compliance with those \r\nrequirements must be mandatory in the implementation \r\nof various projects such as building hydropower \r\nfacilities in Central Asia, including compliance by \r\ninternational financial institutions that wish to \r\nparticipate in such projects. \r\n We are also convinced of the importance of \r\nexpanding cooperation and strengthening interaction \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International Fund \r\nto Save the Aral Sea. In this respect, we consider it \r\ntimely and necessary to grant the Fund observer status \r\nin the General Assembly, and we call upon Member \r\nStates to support the draft resolution on this matter \r\nduring the Assembly’s sixty-third session. \r\n This year in Uzbekistan we will widely observe \r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, and a programme of action dedicated to \r\nthat most significant event has been approved. As of \r\n1 January 2008, Uzbekistan fully abolished the death \r\npenalty and introduced habeas corpus, a democratic \r\nprinciple of justice. The adoption of the law on \r\nguaranteeing the rights of the child and the ratification \r\nof the International Labour Organization Minimum \r\nAge Convention and Convention on the Worst Forms \r\nof Child Labour have become important steps in \r\nensuring human rights in Uzbekistan. We have adopted \r\na national plan for implementing the commitments \r\nundertaken in those Conventions. Aware of the urgency \r\nof the problem of human trafficking at both domestic \r\nand international levels, in April 2008 Uzbekistan \r\nadopted its law against human trafficking.  \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n21 08-53129 \r\n \r\n Committed to the ideals and principles of human \r\nrights, Uzbekistan advocates gradual reforms and \r\nchanges with the main purpose of ensuring peace in \r\nsociety and greater well-being of the people. \r\n In conclusion, I want to underscore once again \r\nthat Uzbekistan stands ready to engage in further \r\nconstructive multilateral interaction within the United \r\nNations framework to address the urgent issues on the \r\nagenda of the international community. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Dora Bakoyannis, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Greece. \r\n Ms. Bakoyannis (Greece) (spoke in French): \r\nSophocles said that all mankind is subject to error. We \r\nare gathered here in this Assembly in order to limit the \r\nscope of those errors and to ensure respect for the \r\nmandate of the United Nations. My Government fully \r\nagrees with the objectives and ideas expressed by \r\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy as President of the European \r\nUnion (see A/63/PV.5).  \r\n There is much that remains to be done and many \r\nobstacles to be overcome: armed conflict, hunger, \r\npoverty, environmental degradation, terrorism, \r\norganized crime, human trafficking, lack of respect for \r\nhuman rights and the abuse of power. All these things \r\nthreaten what we wish to build in the United Nations: a \r\ncommunity of States that enjoys progress, peace and \r\nprosperity.  \r\n Add the economic crisis the world faces now to \r\nthose scourges, and it becomes difficult not to see the \r\nfuture as dark and menacing. As the poet Yeats \r\ndescribed, we live in a world where \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n“The best lack all conviction, while the worst are \r\nfull of passionate intensity.” \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n During this critical period, every country must \r\nmake a choice: either to focus solely on its own limited \r\ninterests and promote nationalistic ends in order to \r\ndistract people’s attention from danger throughout the \r\nworld, or to look outwards, to open its mind and \r\nborders and to commit to warning people that the only \r\nway to face threats successfully is to do so together. \r\n The history of Greece and the character of the Greek \r\npeople are such that we have chosen the second path. It \r\nwas in ancient Greece that society for the first time \r\ndeveloped those ideals that are cherished today by free \r\npeople throughout the world: democracy, equality and \r\nindividual rights. More recently, we have lived through \r\nseveral wars, poverty and deprivation. Nevertheless, we \r\nendured, and we have been able once again to grab hold \r\nof the ideas that we were the first to profess. \r\n We have not forgotten, however, what it is like to \r\nfeel fear and need. This is why we will continue to \r\nwork closely with all States, organizations and \r\ninstitutions to ensure that all people can live in security \r\nand can prosper and thrive. \r\n The United Nations must be at the helm of this \r\neffort. In order to play its role efficiently, the United \r\nNations needs increased support from us all, \r\nparticularly in its efforts to develop and improve. \r\nDiscussions about Security Council reforms and the \r\nneed to breathe new life into the General Assembly \r\nhave been going on for far too long. We hope that, \r\nstarting at this session, today, concrete measures will \r\nbe adopted to reach our objective. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\nUnfortunately, gross violations of human rights persist \r\nthroughout the world, and we Member States need to \r\nredouble our efforts to reduce them. The Human Rights \r\nCouncil could be a powerful force in that struggle, and \r\nGreece has decided to become a candidate for \r\nmembership for the term beginning in 2012. We ask for \r\nthe Assembly’s support and trust. \r\n Along with protecting human rights, the United \r\nNations must strengthen its efforts to alleviate the bitter \r\npoverty that still grips many parts of the world. We need to \r\nincrease trade for development, and we regret the lack \r\nof progress in the Doha Round. In 2000, we agreed on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), probably \r\nthe most ambitious development project ever \r\nundertaken by man. In terms of time, we are halfway \r\nthere. Yet a lot remains to be done. The progress \r\nachieved so far is jeopardized by higher prices, \r\nparticularly for food and oil, and the global economic \r\nslowdown. Our success will be judged primarily in \r\nAfrica. \r\n We believe that one way to help jumpstart \r\ndevelopment in Africa is to involve women in the \r\neconomy more extensively. Providing entrepreneurial \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 22 \r\n \r\nopportunities to women at local, national and regional \r\nlevels will allow them to strengthen their role in \r\nsociety, increase their involvement in education and \r\nultimately allow them to play a more active part in \r\ndecision-making. As the French social theorist Charles \r\nFourier said more than 200 years ago, “The extension \r\nof women’s rights is the basic principle of all social \r\nprogress.” \r\n The challenge of climate change, if not addressed, \r\nthreatens not only the MDGs but also the economic and \r\nsocial stability of our world. We have to achieve, in \r\n2009, a new, truly global agreement with ambitious, \r\nbinding mitigation targets. We also need a much \r\nstronger effort on adaptation, where there is a huge \r\ndeficit between the needs and the actual financing \r\nprovided. That deficit is exacerbated by the fact that no \r\nmatter what we do, we are locked in for significant \r\nclimate change in the next three to four decades, which is \r\ngoing to especially affect the less developed countries. It is \r\nan unjust reality that those that are least to blame for the \r\ncreation of the problem are to suffer most. \r\n Greece is moving to face this challenge. We have \r\nsigned, this week in New York, agreements with the \r\nAfrican Union and the Caribbean Community for \r\nthe funding of adaptation projects, and we plan to do \r\nthe same with the Alliance of Small Island States, \r\nproviding a total of €20 million for the next four years. \r\nOne might argue that this is just a drop in the adaptation \r\nbucket. It is, however, a drop in an empty bucket. \r\n Migration is a critical element in the development \r\nof neglected regions, and the United Nations High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment has taken the lead in dramatizing the \r\nlink. By hosting the third Global Forum on Migration \r\nand Development in the fall of 2009, Greece aims to \r\nprovide a platform on which to explore solutions and \r\ninitiatives for the benefit of all countries and especially \r\nfor the immigrants themselves. \r\n As heartbreaking as the suffering of immigrants \r\nand refugees often is, nothing can compare to the \r\nmisery involved in human trafficking. Young women \r\nwho leave their homes in search of a better livelihood \r\nare exploited, brutalized and forced into a life of \r\nunspeakable depravity by the traffickers in human \r\nmisery who are involved in the international sex trade. \r\nI say it is time for the international community to say \r\n“Enough!” I urge all the members of the United \r\nNations to begin working together forcefully to put an \r\nend to this blight on human dignity. \r\n Along with protecting the weak and vulnerable, \r\nthe United Nations has the responsibility to act \r\nforcefully and to protect the world from the kind of \r\nfanaticism and extremism that cripples any social \r\nprogramme. Terrorism poses a major threat to the \r\nsecurity of our countries, to the stability of our \r\ndemocratic societies and to the rights and freedoms of \r\nour citizens. Around the world, whether in Afghanistan \r\nor Pakistan, Iraq or Yemen, the international \r\ncommunity must show its strong commitment to \r\ncombating terrorism while protecting human rights and \r\nthe rule of law. \r\n On regional security, Greece is preparing to \r\nassume the chairmanship of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) next \r\nJanuary. The OSCE — the world’s largest regional \r\nsecurity organization — can be a forum for frank and \r\nfruitful talks on security issues and can contribute \r\neffectively to such crucial concerns as early warning, \r\nconflict prevention, crisis management and post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation. Finland, the current Chair, has \r\nmade a major effort to promote positive discussions \r\namong the OSCE States, and Greece intends to \r\ncontinue that policy and try to resolve outstanding \r\nissues. \r\n The crisis in South Ossetia has created a volatile \r\nsituation that affects stability in all the South Caucasus \r\nand has exacerbated international tension. Greece’s \r\nposition on that crisis is rooted in the principles that \r\nhave always guided our foreign policy — peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and respect for the sovereignty, \r\nindependence and territorial integrity of States. In both \r\nthe European Union (EU) and NATO, we supported the \r\nsix-point agreement that helped end conflict in the \r\narea, but we are anxious to see measures that will \r\nalleviate the anger and mistrust that now pervade the \r\nregion. \r\n In the broader Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict is at the root of most of the problems, and the \r\nregion requires a comprehensive and lasting solution. \r\nI think that we all agree that the peace process \r\nrelaunched last year at the Annapolis conference has \r\nthe potential to achieve tangible results and merits the \r\nstrong support of all of us. \r\n In Lebanon, we welcome the presidential \r\nelection, the formation of the National Unity \r\n4\r\n3\r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n23 08-53129 \r\n \r\nGovernment and the resumption of the national \r\ndialogue. Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity should be respected, in conformity with the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. \r\n Turning to our immediate neighbourhood, Greece \r\nis committed to a South-Eastern Europe where all \r\ncountries belong to the European and Euro-Atlantic \r\nfamilies. We were as pleased to welcome Croatia and \r\nAlbania to NATO a few months ago as we were to \r\nwelcome Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union \r\nlast year. We have been encouraged also by the recent \r\ndevelopments in Serbia, a country which grows closer \r\nto Europe every day. \r\n In the same spirit, we agree with our NATO allies \r\nand European Union partners that invitations to the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be \r\nextended when a mutually acceptable solution is \r\nreached on the name issue. Greece will continue to be \r\nguided by the letter and the spirit of Security Council \r\nresolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993) on that issue, \r\nand I want to take this opportunity to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General and his Personal \r\nEnvoy, Mr. Matthew Nimetz, for their commitment and \r\ntheir tireless efforts to settle the dispute. \r\n The new reality of Kosovo requires continued \r\nattention from the international community. The United \r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo has \r\ndone a good job providing security for Kosovo’s \r\npopulation, and its successor, the European Union Rule \r\nof Law Mission Kosovo, should assume its \r\nresponsibilities as soon as possible. \r\n Beyond the Western Balkans, Greece continues \r\ntaking fruitful initiatives in the spirit of international \r\nlaw and the United Nations Charter to broaden and \r\nstrengthen cooperation with Turkey. We are convinced \r\nthat modern Turkey, with a clear European orientation, \r\nwill add to the stability of our region. We therefore \r\nsupport the European aspirations of Turkey as it moves \r\nto meet the prerequisites set out in the negotiating \r\nframework of the European Union. But words must be \r\nmatched with deeds. The principles of good-\r\nneighbourly relations and peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes with other nations are essential preconditions. \r\nYet 34 years after the 1974 invasion of Cyprus, a \r\nsovereign United Nations and European Union member \r\nState, Turkey continues to occupy over one third of the \r\nisland’s territory with nearly 40,000 troops. That \r\nunacceptable situation is a flagrant violation of \r\ninternational law, a threat to the security and welfare of \r\nGreek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike, and a \r\nserious obstacle to the stabilization of the region. \r\n Greece has consistently supported Cyprus in its \r\nnatural and justified desire to see the withdrawal of all \r\noccupation forces as part of a settlement for its \r\nreunification as a bizonal, bicommunal federation with \r\nintercommunal equality, a single sovereignty, a single \r\ncitizenship and a single international persona. Relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and principles exist to \r\nprovide the framework for a mutually acceptable \r\nsolution. \r\n We thus welcomed the recent decision by Cypriot \r\nPresident Dimitris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot \r\nleader Mehmet Ali Talat to resume negotiations under \r\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General. We believe that \r\na viable solution can be achieved by the Cypriots \r\nthemselves through negotiations between the two \r\ncommunities without artificial deadlines and \r\narbitration. We shall continue to do everything possible \r\nto facilitate a settlement, and we hope that Turkey will \r\nalso demonstrate flexibility and goodwill towards that \r\nend. \r\n As is obvious to all of us, the United Nations is \r\nonce again beset by a host of troubles that will require \r\nthe patience of Job to endure and the strength of \r\nHercules to confront. As individual States, we have no \r\nhope of marshalling the strength to contemplate, let \r\nalone battle, the dangers facing us. But together, \r\nthrough the United Nations, we can find the resolve not \r\nonly to confront those awesome challenges but to \r\nsubdue the threat that they pose for humankind. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Esaw, Minister of State, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration \r\nof Togo. \r\n Mr. Esaw (Togo) (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nfirst of all to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. He can count on the \r\nfull cooperation of the Togolese as he carries out his \r\nnoble task. We would also like to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the insight \r\nand determination which he has demonstrated in \r\nleading the Organization since taking up his post. \r\n At the high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs, held here on 22 September, \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 24 \r\n \r\nMember States noted that despite the efforts that have \r\nbeen made, the situation in Africa demands continued \r\nserious consideration by the international community \r\nin order to help Africa face up to the many challenges \r\nit faces. It was also stressed that the fight against \r\npoverty and the fight for sustainable development \r\ncannot succeed without considerable official \r\ndevelopment assistance and fairer trade between \r\nnations.  \r\n In that regard, it is unfortunate that the North-\r\nSouth dialogue has been exhausted, as evidenced by \r\nthe recent failure of the World Trade Organization \r\nnegotiations in Geneva. Indeed, while international \r\ntrade should become a tool for development, the \r\nbalance of global economic power, which was \r\nresponsible to a great degree for the dependence of \r\ncountries of the South on their partners in the North, \r\nwill continue to deteriorate. Most countries perceive \r\nglobalization as the status quo, which makes the \r\nobjectives of development and social justice even more \r\ndifficult to achieve. To think that, when the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) were adopted in 2000, \r\nmany of us were hopeful that they would be achieved. \r\nFor that reason we call upon the international \r\ncommunity, especially the countries of the North, to \r\nrespect the commitments made. \r\n We note with concern that today new and even \r\ngreater challenges are being added to the long list of \r\nthose which our States already face. The sharp rise in \r\nthe price of oil and other raw materials, as well as the \r\nincreasing demand for energy, along with the effects of \r\nthe global food and financial crises are among these \r\nnew challenges. \r\n The current food crisis will not fail to have \r\ncatastrophic consequences if aid to agriculture is not \r\nreviewed and increased; it is unfortunate that such \r\nassistance was cut by half between 1992 to 2000. It \r\nshould also be stressed that few resources have been \r\nallocated to agricultural infrastructure, to irrigation and \r\nto supplying water to the population. \r\n We venture to hope that the new partnership \r\nestablished on 4 June in Rome between the Alliance for \r\na Green Revolution in Africa, the United Nations, the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization, the International \r\nFund for Agricultural Development and the World \r\nFood Programme will contribute to an appropriate \r\nresponse to the situation. \r\n Togo has suffered the negative effects of a long \r\npolitical and economic crisis. However, since President \r\nFaure Essozimna Gnassingbé’s accession to power in \r\nMay 2005, the Togolese Government has sought \r\nsuitable solutions to the major concerns of the Togolese \r\npeople by implementing a pragmatic policy based on \r\nnational reconciliation, poverty reduction and \r\nstrengthening democracy and the rule of law. \r\n In that context, the head of State worked to \r\nconclude a comprehensive political agreement in \r\nAugust 2006, which was signed by the major political \r\nparties and which opened the way for the holding of \r\nlegislative elections in October 2007. There is little \r\nneed to remind members that those elections took place \r\nin a peaceful, transparent and safe environment. They \r\nled to the establishment of a broad-based Government \r\nand a pluralistic National Assembly, which shows the \r\ncommitment of the head of State to strengthen the \r\ndemocratization process in an atmosphere of \r\nunderstanding and national unity. \r\n We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nour thanks to the friendly countries and multilateral \r\npartners that have fully resumed their cooperation with \r\nTogo following the implementation of the agreements \r\nsigned. In order to consolidate that commitment \r\nprocess, the Togolese Government is working tirelessly \r\nto see through the institutional and constitutional \r\nreforms provided for by the comprehensive political \r\nagreement. \r\n In the legal field, it has undertaken to modernize \r\nthe justice system, so as to guarantee its independence. \r\nIn the same vein, national consultations aimed at \r\nestablishing a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation \r\nCommission were launched on 15 April 2008. The \r\nCommission will be charged with shedding light on \r\nacts of political violence committed in the past and \r\nfinding ways to compensate the victims. The results of \r\nthose consultations have just been submitted to the \r\nhead of State. \r\n Similarly, in its search for better strategies to \r\nfight corruption and improve good economic \r\ngovernance, Togo recently signed a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding with the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism, by which it agrees to submit to periodic \r\nreviews by the other members of the African Union \r\n(AU) and to be directed by the jointly adopted \r\nparameters for political, economic and financial \r\ngovernance in Africa. As part of the financial reform, \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n25 08-53129 \r\n \r\nsoon the post of auditor-general and a national audit \r\noffice will be set up. A Government audit programme \r\nis in the process of being finalized. \r\n The torrential rainfall that struck our country last \r\nJuly sorely tested our Government’s efforts. It led to \r\ncountless human injuries and material and financial \r\nlosses, including the collapse of a dozen bridges, the \r\nflooding of railways and the destruction of roads, \r\nvillages and fields. That disaster, the second of its kind \r\nin a year, makes it very difficult to move from region \r\nto region. \r\n The solidarity shown to our country enabled us to \r\nassist the affected and to start rebuilding some of the \r\ninfrastructure. Here, I should like to express our deep \r\ngratitude to Ghana, Benin, France, China, the United \r\nStates of America, Brazil and all the other countries, \r\norganizations and institutions that helped us. \r\n As members can see, in spite of our efforts the \r\noverall situation in our country is far from satisfactory. \r\nTherefore, our country deserves more substantial \r\nsupport. In that regard, the positive results of the Togo \r\nDevelopment Partners Conference, held in Brussels on \r\n18 and 19 September, leads us to hope that the \r\ninternational community is ready to play a decisive \r\nrole in assisting our country to get back on its feet. \r\n We would like once again to express our \r\nprofound thanks to all those who contributed to the \r\nsuccess of that conference, in particular the European \r\nUnion, France, Germany, the United States of America, \r\nPortugal, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, the Niger, the World \r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund, the Islamic \r\nDevelopment Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \r\nCentral Bank of West African States, the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the \r\nWest African Economic and Monetary Union. \r\n For decades, Togolese diplomacy has worked to \r\nstrengthen friendship and cooperation among States \r\nand peoples. Thus, at both the bilateral and the \r\nmultilateral levels, Togo has always done its utmost to \r\nachieve the peaceful settlement of disputes with the \r\npurpose of maintaining peace and stability wherever \r\nthreatened. Those actions, undertaken through dialogue \r\nand consultation, are part of the efforts made by \r\nAfrican countries to ensure better living conditions for \r\ntheir populations. Togo believes that dialogue and \r\nconsultation must be the preferred ways to settle \r\nethnic, religious or territorial disputes, which are true \r\nobstacles to harmonious coexistence among States and \r\npeoples. \r\n Along those lines, it must be recalled that the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, which is at the core of the \r\npolitical and security problems in the Middle East, \r\ncontinues to be the focus of the highest concern for the \r\ninternational community. In order to promote peace \r\nand stability in that region, the international \r\ncommunity must make a greater effort to find a just \r\nand lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. \r\n In that regard, Togo welcomes the ongoing \r\ndialogue between the parties and hopes that the various \r\ninitiatives will lead to a comprehensive solution, based \r\non the principle of two States, Israeli and Palestinian, \r\nliving within secure and internationally recognized \r\nborders. \r\n Afghanistan and Iraq, which are experiencing a \r\nmajor lack of security, deserve special attention. We \r\ntherefore call on the international community to \r\nincrease its assistance to the Governments of those \r\ncountries in their fight against terrorism, so as to \r\npromote peace and reconstruction. \r\n In Africa, while it is true that glimmers of hope \r\nare to be seen in the settlement of crises, one cannot \r\nbut condemn situations such as those persisting in \r\nDarfur and Somalia. We call on the various actors to \r\ndemonstrate more courage and political will to get out \r\nof the vicious circle of violence and, thus, give peace a \r\nchance. \r\n Because of the orientation of its foreign policy, \r\nthe Togolese Government endorses all initiatives aimed \r\nat preventing, fighting and eliminating the causes of \r\nconflict, in particular the trafficking of and illegal trade \r\nin small arms. For that reason, it did not hesitate to \r\nsupport the proposal to draft and adopt a binding \r\ninternational instrument on the trade in small arms. \r\nAlong those same lines, Togo was involved in activities \r\nlinked to promoting and safeguarding international \r\npeace and security, as demonstrated by its participation \r\nin the various peacekeeping operations of the United \r\nNations, the African Union and ECOWAS. \r\n Today more than ever, the world needs security \r\nand peace in order to devote its energies to eliminating \r\nhunger, illiteracy and disease. To that end, it is more \r\nurgent than ever to make concerted efforts to fight \r\ninequality, injustice and exclusion. \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 26 \r\n \r\n In our respective countries, we must build \r\nsocieties where humanism and solidarity will reign in \r\npeace and security. We believe that that is one of the \r\npurposes of the founders of the United Nations and \r\nwhich we must strive to achieve now, at the beginning \r\nof the twenty-first century. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency The Honourable Paula Gopee-Scoon, MP, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago. \r\n Mrs. Gopee-Scoon (Trinidad and Tobago): I am \r\nhonoured to be afforded the opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also wish \r\nto extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. D’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election to the presidency. I am \r\nconvinced that his wealth of experience, garnered over \r\nthe years in the different capacities in which he has \r\nserved and his strong conviction of the importance of \r\nmultilateralism and respect for international law, will \r\nbe brought to bear in a most positive and productive \r\nway on the proceedings of the session. Further, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago is gratified that Nicaragua and, by \r\nextension, Central America, has been graced with the \r\ndistinct honour of guiding the work of the sixty-third \r\nsession. \r\n At the same time, my delegation wishes to \r\nexpress our heartfelt appreciation and admiration for \r\nthe way in which His Excellency Srgjan Kerim of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia conducted the \r\naffairs of the General Assembly during the last session. \r\n The Secretary-General must be commended, \r\nparticularly for his untiring efforts in ensuring that \r\nhumanitarian relief is brought to thousands of victims \r\nof natural disasters, including in the Caribbean. Given \r\nthe increasing frequency and ferocity of hurricanes and \r\nother similar climatic phenomena, there is dire need for \r\nthe provision of early warning systems and capacity-\r\nbuilding programmes in vulnerable regions like the \r\nCaribbean, aimed at enhancing planning and \r\npreparedness and at mitigating the effects of such \r\ndisasters. We applaud all efforts to bring relief to those \r\naffected. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The recent disasters bring into sharp focus the \r\nimperative of purposeful action on the problems of \r\nclimate change at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. Trinidad and Tobago is committed \r\nto adopting concrete measures aimed at reducing its \r\nlevels of greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same \r\ntime promoting balanced industrialization and \r\nenvironmental sustainability. \r\n Notwithstanding its current healthy endowment \r\nof hydrocarbon resources, Trinidad and Tobago \r\nrecognizes the need to promote clean energy \r\nalternatives, the development of new and renewable \r\nenergy options and the proper protection and \r\nmanagement of the nation’s forests. Indeed, the \r\nGovernment is putting into effect appropriate policies \r\nfor substantial results in that area. We hope to achieve \r\nmeaningful progress, in cooperation with development \r\npartners within the public and private sectors, both \r\nlocally and internationally, and with civil society. \r\n Cooperation at the international level is also \r\nindispensable to efforts aimed at addressing the current \r\nenergy crisis. Trinidad and Tobago is seeking to partner \r\nwith its African friends in order to, among other things, \r\nidentify ways of developing long-term strategies for \r\nthe sustainable development and utilization of their \r\nenergy resources. That is in keeping with the pledge \r\nmade by The Honourable Patrick Manning, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, in \r\n2007, when he addressed the eighth Summit of the \r\nAfrican Union, in Ethiopia. Since then, discussions \r\nhave ensued with individual African States and with \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS), to advance the initiative. The Government \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago is eager to work assiduously \r\ntowards the attainment of our common objectives. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago firmly believes that the \r\nUnited Nations must take the lead in the management \r\nof the global food crisis, in which we are confronted \r\nwith a situation of losing thousands to hunger on an \r\nalmost daily basis. We embrace the various multilateral \r\ninitiatives to address that grave challenge, including \r\nthe establishment by the Secretary-General of the \r\nHigh-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security \r\nCrisis in April 2008 and the adoption of its \r\nComprehensive Framework for Action. \r\n The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger is \r\none of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to \r\nbe achieved by 2015. We cannot allow the threat posed \r\nby the global food crisis to reverse the strides made so \r\nfar by many developing countries to achieve that Goal. \r\nWe must utilize all the resources at our disposal, \r\nincluding a recommitment to the Food and Agriculture \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n27 08-53129 \r\n \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), which was \r\nestablished to help developing countries and countries \r\nin transition modernize and improve agriculture and \r\nfisheries practices and to ensure good nutrition for \r\ntheir citizens. We must work in concert to provide that \r\ninstitution with the resources necessary to discharge \r\neffectively its mandates. If we fail to win the war \r\nagainst that common enemy, we will be compromising \r\nthe right to food and by extension the right to life of \r\nmillions of people. \r\n The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has \r\nembraced a number of key policy initiatives that are \r\ndesigned to guarantee our citizens access to food of \r\nsufficient quality and quantity and to reduce the impact \r\nof the food crisis. Thousands of acres have been made \r\navailable for diversified agricultural production. In \r\naddition, capital is accessible to farmers through our \r\nnational Agricultural Development Bank. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago recognizes that food \r\nsecurity must also be pursued in the context of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) Single Market and \r\nEconomy, which provides the opportunity for the \r\nintegration of production and cross-border investment \r\nin agricultural production in those countries which \r\nhave greater agricultural potential and resources. The \r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago therefore hosted, \r\njointly with the CARICOM secretariat and the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization, a regional agriculture \r\ndonor conference in June 2007. \r\n Similarly, like poverty and hunger, terrorism \r\nremains a major scourge on our societies and poses a \r\ndirect threat to democratic institutions. It undermines \r\nthe rule of law, infringes human rights and generally \r\naffects the well-being of its victims. Trinidad and \r\nTobago is convinced that members of the international \r\ncommunity must embrace multilateral solutions in the \r\nfight against terrorism. We remain committed to the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \r\nwhich is complementary to our own efforts to combat \r\nterrorism. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago views the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council as indispensable to the transformation \r\nand further democratization of the United Nations. As a \r\nsmall island developing State, Trinidad and Tobago \r\nwishes to reiterate its position on Security Council \r\nreform, which emphasizes the need for, among other \r\nthings, equity of access for small States to the Security \r\nCouncil and the need for representation of all regions \r\nof the world in its permanent membership. Failure to \r\nreform the Security Council could serve to undermine \r\nthat organ’s authority as the body with the primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, as well as its ability to discharge its \r\nother obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that the United \r\nNations remains the principal vehicle for meaningful \r\nexchanges between members of the international \r\ncommunity on matters of international concern. Such \r\ndeliberations, in our view, constitute the bedrock of the \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations system and are \r\nfor us a priority consideration. We recognize therefore \r\nthe great value of the informal consultations on \r\nsystem-wide coherence aimed at making the \r\nOrganization deliver as one. \r\n Further progress on that issue during the current \r\nsession is imperative for the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system to be able to provide Member \r\nStates, particularly developing countries, with the \r\nassistance required to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the other internationally \r\nagreed development goals. \r\n The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has \r\ncharted a development policy to achieve the MDGs \r\nwithin the stipulated period, as well as to transform the \r\ncountry to developed status by the year 2020. The pace \r\nof economic growth over the past decade has \r\nfortunately enabled us to surpass MDG targets in \r\nachieving universal primary education, promoting \r\ngender equality, empowering women and significantly \r\nreducing the level of poverty. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago’s development strategy \r\nexceeds the MDG targets in some respects. The \r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago has been able to \r\nprovide free secondary and tertiary education to its \r\ncitizens. In addition, 30 per cent of our cabinet \r\nministers and members of parliament are women. \r\n Regrettably, for many developing States, the \r\nachievement of the MDGs within the stipulated period \r\nappears to be elusive. We therefore urge all \r\ndevelopment partners to honour their commitments and \r\npledges already agreed upon. \r\n Another important international process to which \r\nTrinidad and Tobago attaches great importance is the \r\nreview of the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 28 \r\n \r\nConsensus on Financing for Development, which will \r\nbe addressed at a follow-up international conference in \r\nDoha, Qatar, in November. The Monterrey Consensus, \r\nadopted by heads of State or Government in 2002, \r\ncalled for the mobilization of resources to assist \r\ndeveloping countries in meeting the MDGs and \r\nrecognized the importance of coherence and \r\nconsistency within and among the international \r\nmonetary, financial and trading systems in support of \r\noverall development. While there have been some \r\nadvances under the key pillars of financing for \r\ndevelopment, they have not been sufficiently \r\nfar-reaching. In the light of the current financial crisis, \r\nthe timing for the convening of the follow-up \r\nconference is most timely and presents an opportunity \r\nfor the forging of global partnerships in a spirit of \r\nsolidarity. A key component for success will be an \r\nongoing engagement between Governments and all \r\nstakeholders, including the private sector and civil \r\nsociety. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago is committed to the regional \r\nintegration movement of CARICOM and has continued \r\nto provide economic assistance to our CARICOM \r\npartners within the ambit of that multilateral \r\nframework and other bilateral arrangements. One such \r\narrangement is Trinidad and Tobago’s Petroleum \r\nDevelopment Fund, a facility that only recently was \r\ndrawn upon to provide substantial assistance to some \r\nof our Caribbean neighbours in the aftermath of recent \r\nhurricanes. Another is the CARICOM Trade Support \r\nProgramme, a comprehensive loan facility of $16.5 \r\nmillion that is aimed at improving the trade capacity of \r\nCARICOM States by providing assistance in the \r\ndiversification of their economies and in improving \r\ntrade capacity. \r\n The Caribbean also falls prey to the nefarious \r\ntrade in narcotics, to which the illegal proliferation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons is linked. In an effort to \r\nconfront these challenges, we have concluded with our \r\nneighbours the CARICOM Maritime and Air Space \r\nSecurity Cooperation Agreement to protect our borders \r\nfrom illegal activities. We recognize, however, the \r\nimportant role of the United Nations as the premier \r\nmultilateral forum in providing assistance in areas such \r\nas capacity-building to augment our own resources. For \r\nthe States of the Caribbean, a critical aspect of \r\ndisarmament is the eradication of the illegal trade in \r\nsmall arms. Trinidad and Tobago therefore calls for \r\nurgent action to complete the work on the elaboration \r\nof an arms trade treaty. \r\n In the context of our efforts to address the \r\nchallenge, we also wish to call again for consideration \r\nto be given to the inclusion of international drug \r\ntrafficking as one of the crimes within the jurisdiction \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\n It is of great significance to us that the very year \r\nwe celebrate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nthe Rome Statute of the ICC, we also commemorate the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Since its establishment, \r\nthe ICC has been able to attract 100 States parties, \r\nissue arrest warrants and begin trials of persons \r\naccused of committing crimes of major concern to the \r\ninternational community. The perpetrators of genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes show flagrant \r\ndisregard for the human rights of their victims, as well \r\nas for human rights law and humanitarian law, none of \r\nwhich should go unpunished. \r\n The United Nations has played a seminal role in \r\nthe promotion and development of international law, \r\nwhich has contributed to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and friendly relations \r\namong States. As a small State, Trinidad and Tobago \r\nviews adherence to and respect for the rule of law as a \r\nbulwark against intrusions that could affect our \r\nterritorial integrity, independence and economic \r\ndevelopment and the general well-being of our \r\ncitizens. However, we are conscious of the need for \r\ninternational cooperation in the implementation of \r\ninternational legal obligations under various \r\nconventions that provide mutual benefits to Member \r\nStates. \r\n One area of which the United Nations can be \r\njustly proud is the conclusion of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. The Convention has \r\nworked well since its adoption and entry into force, \r\nand it has provided legal certainty to activities carried \r\nout by States in different maritime zones. In keeping \r\nwith our obligations under the Convention, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago is in the process of completing work on its \r\nsubmission to the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf by May 2009 to extend its \r\ncontinental shelf jurisdiction beyond 200 nautical miles \r\nfrom the baselines from which the breadth of the \r\nterritorial sea is measured. We do so with full respect \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n29 08-53129 \r\n \r\nfor the sovereign right of other coastal States to make \r\nsimilar submissions to the Commission. \r\n Our region is home to the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, which is located in Jamaica. The Authority’s \r\nmandate is derived from the Convention, and it is \r\nentrusted with the responsibility to administer the \r\nresources of the International Seabed Area, which is \r\nthe common heritage of mankind. As in previous years, \r\nwe again call on all members of the Authority to make \r\nevery effort to attend its meetings. \r\n In conclusion, Trinidad and Tobago wishes to \r\nreaffirm its faith in and commitment to multilateralism \r\nat the regional, hemispheric and international levels. \r\nDialogue among States must always be the preferred \r\noption for solving the myriad problems that we face in \r\nan increasingly complex international environment. It \r\nis in recognition of this importance that Trinidad and \r\nTobago has taken the bold decision to host in 2009 \r\nboth the Summit of the Americas and the \r\nCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. \r\nDialogue in those two bodies, which are microcosms of \r\nthe United Nations, could also influence discussions at \r\nthe United Nations, an institution that we must \r\ncontinue to transform, guard and protect, in order to be \r\nable to bequeath it to future generations. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Gonzalo Fernández, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Eastern Republic of \r\nUruguay. \r\n Mr. Fernández (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nUruguay, one of the founding States of the United \r\nNations, sees the fundamental principles of its foreign \r\npolicy fully reflected in the Charter of this \r\nOrganization.  \r\n For that reason, we believe it important at the \r\noutset to reassert the validity of those principles in the \r\npresent international context and to emphasize once \r\nagain the traditional Uruguayan position of full respect \r\nfor international law, support for multilateralism, \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, sovereign equality of \r\nStates, rejection of the use or threat of use of force, \r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, \r\nthe self-determination of peoples, the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and international economic \r\nand social cooperation. \r\n It is worth repeating that this list is not simply an \r\ninventory of good intentions, but of legal principles \r\nand fundamental values. Their enshrinement in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations gives them the status of \r\ninternational law, to whose validity and enforcement \r\nall States must conform. \r\n Furthermore, those principles are crucial guiding \r\ntools in a world that presents us today with major \r\nchallenges. We, nations gathered here, have the moral \r\nand legal duty to find suitable solutions that will make \r\npeace and development the rule of coexistence for our \r\npeoples. \r\n As we all know, a severe food crisis is currently \r\nafflicting too many countries throughout the world. If a \r\nsustainable and lasting solution in to be found, we must \r\naddress the structural factors influencing and causing \r\nthe crisis. Correcting the distortions in the multilateral \r\ntrade system, in particular in agricultural trade, is \r\ncertainly a decisive element in ensuring a plentiful \r\nsupply of food that will meet the needs of the entire \r\npopulation of the planet. \r\n Uruguay believes that, in addition to tackling this \r\nserious crisis with urgent measures, we must make \r\nprogress towards a long-term solution. That inevitably \r\nmeans redoubling our efforts to strengthen the \r\nmultilateral trade system and swiftly resuming the \r\nnegotiations in the World Trade Organization. It is \r\nessential that we do so, particularly in the area of \r\nagriculture, in order to guarantee world food security \r\nand to avoid a reversion to protectionist practices that \r\nwould only further aggravate the situation.  \r\n The food crisis is not the only crisis affecting us, \r\nhowever; another major challenge facing the world \r\neconomy is undoubtedly that of energy. Here, as with \r\nagriculture, Latin America requires the technological \r\ncooperation of developed countries. Likewise, when it \r\ncomes to developing the production of alternative \r\nenergy sources, such as bioenergy and biofuels, \r\nresearch and technical assistance are essential if we are \r\nto benefit from the opportunities provided by such \r\nproduction without affecting food security or the \r\nenvironment. The United Nations has a crucially \r\nimportant catalytic role in that regard.  \r\n In addition, we cannot overlook the current \r\nfinancial crisis of the major developed countries, which \r\ndemonstrates the global interconnectedness and \r\ninterdependence among States. Although developing \r\ncountries are certainly not the cause of the crisis, its \r\neffects afflict and punish the economies of emerging \r\ncountries. \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 30 \r\n \r\n With regard to the environment and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, Uruguay is a party to the major \r\ninternational conventions in that area. While we have \r\nemphasized the importance of international \r\ncooperation, we have also always emphasized the \r\nindividual responsibility of every State to actively \r\nprotect the environment in its own territory and waters, \r\nand have always valued the vigilant participation of \r\ncivil society in that regard.  \r\n That is why, while we receive significant \r\ninvestments that contribute to our industrial \r\ndevelopment, my country also exerts rigorous control \r\nover the environmental practices of the entities \r\ninvolved, applying internationally recognized standards \r\nand requiring the use of the most modern technologies \r\navailable, with effective control over the environmental \r\nimpact of those undertakings. The Uruguayan \r\nGovernment thus reaffirms its unwavering commitment \r\nto protecting the environment as a human right and as a \r\nfundamental component in the achievement of true \r\nsustainable development. \r\n Another major issue on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly is the Millennium Development Goals \r\nagreed by Member States in September 2000, which \r\nUruguay has fully endorsed. In that context, Uruguay \r\nhas taken firm steps to achieve the Goals. We need \r\nonly highlight, among other policies with a significant \r\nsocial content, the recent launching of our \r\ncomprehensive national health system — aimed at \r\ntransforming the health-care model by prioritizing \r\nprimary health care and prevention in order to \r\nguarantee a basic right of all citizens — as part of the \r\nsocial inclusion policy that Uruguay is implementing.  \r\n Given its strict adherence to international law, \r\nUruguay is also firmly committed to consolidating \r\ninternational peace and security, as demonstrated by its \r\nstatus as one of the 10 major contributors of troops to \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and as the \r\nworld’s largest contributor per capita in terms of troop \r\nnumbers. Our country is currently participating in \r\n16 United Nations peacekeeping missions deployed in \r\nAfrica, the Americas, Asia and Europe. Since we began \r\nto participate in peacekeeping missions, Uruguay has \r\ngained experience in matters related to reconstruction \r\nand peacebuilding in areas devastated by conflict, \r\nmaking great efforts to put an end to hostilities so that \r\nvarious societies and communities can agree on peace \r\nand achieve national reconciliation. \r\n However, as our international experience has \r\ntaught us, peacekeeping, while essential, is not \r\nsufficient to return affected countries to institutional \r\nnormalcy and an orderly and peaceful life. That is why \r\nthe strong involvement of the international community \r\nis needed in peacekeeping efforts to effectively ensure \r\nthe building of stable, democratic and prosperous \r\nsocieties through robust institutional mechanisms for \r\nresolving their conflicts. For that reason, Uruguay \r\nsubmitted its candidature to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in February 2007. We hope to be able to \r\ncontribute to the attainment of those noble objectives \r\nin that forum.   \r\n The cause of peace requires, in institutional \r\nterms, a strengthened and effective Organization. That \r\nbrings us to the topic of the United Nations reform \r\nprocess. The negotiations in that regard have not \r\nproceeded with the scope and speed originally \r\nenvisaged. Although the two recently established \r\nbodies, the Human Rights Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, have been in existence for \r\na few years, we have not yet been able to move on to \r\nSecurity Council reform — which is essential — and \r\nonly a few timid steps have been taken in the process \r\nof reforming the Secretariat and the General Assembly.  \r\n Uruguay reaffirms its support for the process of \r\nSecurity Council reform in the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership categories. However, we \r\nwill not support the creation of new members with the \r\nright of the veto, since we believe that the issue of \r\nextending the veto must not be included in the package \r\nto be agreed upon in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Moreover, in keeping with its traditional \r\nposition since the founding of the United Nations, our \r\ncountry disapproves of the right of veto, which is a \r\nprivilege that runs counter to the full democratization \r\nof our Organization.  \r\n In the area of reform, we also view the One \r\nUnited Nations pilot project in two ways. We see it \r\nfirst as an instrument through which reform of the \r\noperational activities of the United Nations system \r\ncould be put into practice; and secondly, as a \r\ncooperative exercise in areas of priority identified by \r\nthe Uruguayan Government in the context of a national \r\ndevelopment strategy based on sustained and \r\nsustainable economic growth with equity and social \r\njustice. However, we understand that the programme \r\nshould adapt itself to specific national priorities and \r\nneeds. That is why no single model is applicable to all \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n31 08-53129 \r\n \r\npilot countries, given their inherent differences from \r\none another. \r\n I also wish to refer to a topic of particular \r\nrelevance for Uruguay — the situation of so-called \r\nmiddle-income countries. Those countries find \r\nthemselves in a paradoxical situation. Although there \r\nare certain indicators of economic growth, negative \r\ncircumstances that hinder sustainable and sustained \r\ngrowth in the medium- and long-terms have not been \r\ntaken into account, nor has it been possible to prevent \r\ndramatic erosion of some of the progress made. In \r\nparticular and with dramatic effect, the well-known \r\nclear vulnerability of the economies of developing \r\ncountries in a globalized world economy subjects them \r\nto the effects of external crises with clear, direct \r\nconsequences, such as rising poverty and inequity in \r\nincome distribution, as well as strengthened migratory \r\ntrends, to mention just some effects that Uruguay has \r\nexperienced directly.  \r\n Finally, in affirming its unwavering commitment \r\nto the fight against terrorism, Uruguay reiterates its \r\nrejection of all terrorist acts and vigorously condemns \r\nall attacks against civil populations and public \r\ninfrastructure, the destruction of which adversely \r\naffects the civil population. Terrorism must be \r\nunequivocally condemned and cooperation between \r\nStates must increase in order to ensure that such acts \r\ndo not go unpunished. \r\n We must be careful, however. The fight against \r\nterrorism must always be waged based on the rule of \r\nlaw, and consequently in the strictest respect for the \r\nstandards of international humanitarian and human \r\nrights law. \r\n The same applies to drug trafficking. Our country \r\nhas continued its unrelenting fight against illegal drug \r\ntrafficking. Our effort targets both supply and demand. \r\nThanks to that policy and beyond our success in \r\nstamping out the illicit traffic in those substances, our \r\ncountry has been at the vanguard of our continent in \r\nterms of its policies to prevent consumption and treat \r\nthose affected by drugs. \r\n Both terrorism and drug trafficking severely \r\ncompromise the full enjoyment of human rights, the \r\nsafeguarding of which has been one of the strategic \r\npolicies of the current Government. We want respect \r\nfor human rights to be more than routine rhetoric; it \r\nshould enjoy full expression in the daily life of its \r\ncitizens. On that basis, our country has prioritized \r\nstrengthening legislation and the competent national \r\nbodies, and has sought to extend international human \r\nrights and to consolidate institutions that effectively \r\nprotect and secure the international enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights and prevent their violation. In short, the \r\nprotection of human rights is one of the central axes of \r\nthe Republic’s foreign policy and is without a doubt \r\nUruguay’s basic political institutional asset. \r\n As is evident, the effective protection of human \r\nrights calls for a strong jurisdictional body to guarantee \r\nits application. In that context, the creation of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) was a fundamental \r\ncontribution to the progressive development of \r\ninternational law and an event of tremendous legal and \r\npolitical importance. In 2006, Uruguay enacted a \r\nnational law pledging full cooperation with the ICC. \r\nRespectfully, we urge the international community as a \r\nwhole to do the same in order to prevent genocide, war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity from going \r\nunpunished. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to stress that, with \r\nconflicts threatening peace and international security \r\nand taking into account the growing interdependence \r\nof States as a result of globalization, it is now crucial \r\nto emphatically reaffirm the relevance of the United \r\nNations as the lead body and ultimate multilateral \r\nforum for finding appropriate solutions to today’s \r\nmajor global challenges. \r\n The pursuit of multilateralism therefore implies a \r\nsearch for collective responses to international \r\nconflicts and problems, in accordance with \r\ninternational law and in the framework of the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, which \r\nregulates peaceful coexistence between nations. \r\nIndeed, we must uphold the ideals that inspired the \r\nestablishment of the Organization. That is a civilizing \r\nproject that we cannot abandon as it represents \r\nunfinished business that we owe it to ourselves and to \r\ngenerations to come to complete. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Karel \r\nSchwarzenberg, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nCzech Republic. \r\n Mr. Schwarzenberg (Czech Republic): Let me \r\nbegin by extending my congratulations to you, Sir, on \r\nyour election to the important function of President of \r\nthe General Assembly. You will steer the deliberations \r\nof this key body of the United Nations through a \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 32 \r\n \r\ndifficult period of growing challenges to our common \r\nsecurity and prosperity. Let me assure you of our full \r\nsupport in your endeavours. I also thank your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Kerim. \r\n My country is in full preparation for an enormous \r\ntask that has no precedent in our history. In January \r\n2009, the Czech Republic will assume the \r\nresponsibility of the presidency of the European Union. \r\nWe will do our utmost to uphold our shared \r\ncommitment to world peace and prosperity within that \r\norganization. \r\n The European Union stands at the forefront of the \r\nefforts to strengthen the United Nations capacity to \r\ndeliver effective international responses to global \r\nchallenges. The Czech Republic is committed to \r\nplaying its part and to further enhancing the European \r\nUnion’s contribution by searching for common \r\nresponses. The motto of the upcoming Czech \r\npresidency, “Europe without barriers”, reflects our \r\ndesire to promote the removal of barriers not only \r\nwithin the European Union, but also between the Union \r\nand third countries. In our opinion, it is very much in \r\nline with the efforts to enhance cooperation and to \r\nstrengthen the principle of effective multilateralism. \r\n The agreements reached at the 2005 World \r\nSummit sparked some substantive reforms, but the \r\nprocess has reached a point at which it has become \r\nnecessary to give it a new impulse for further progress. \r\nAn important part of that progress is Security Council \r\nreform. A more representative and transparent Security \r\nCouncil will act with a greater international legitimacy \r\nand authority. The Czech Republic therefore welcomes \r\nthe recent decision to launch the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. However, the authority of the Security \r\nCouncil is being undermined by its inability to address \r\nsome acute international issues. I call on the Council to \r\nreassert its authority in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and to shoulder its \r\nobligations. \r\n The authority of the United Nations is being \r\ntested, and so are our political and moral \r\nresponsibilities. By signing onto the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, all of our countries have committed \r\nthemselves to living in peace and harmony and to \r\nrespecting the principles of peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes and of refraining from the threat and use of \r\nforce, except in self-defence. Today, as security is \r\nbeing challenged in too many parts of the world, those \r\nbasic principles, and the system of international law in \r\ngeneral, need to be upheld as ever. \r\n And yet, we have recently witnessed systematic \r\nprovocations and, finally, a military aggression on the \r\npart of a powerful country, a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council, against its small neighbour with the \r\naim of carving that neighbour up. That action was \r\ndesigned to create two tiny entities, totally dependent \r\nin their administrative, economic and military \r\nstructures. Colonial Powers used to act in that way, and \r\nI would like to stress that alleged interests, privileged \r\nas they may be considered, cannot justify the violation \r\nof our highest common principles, enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nation. Therefore, I fully \r\nsubscribe to the words pronounced by Sergey Lavrov \r\nhere earlier today:  \r\n “We cannot tolerate any attempts to resolve \r\nconflict situations by violating international \r\nagreements or by the unlawful use of force. If we \r\nallow that to occur once, then we run the risk of \r\nunleashing it in the future” (A/63/PV.14). \r\n However, how can one think of redesigning new \r\nEuro-Atlantic security structures without renewing the \r\ntrust that has vanished over the past few months? \r\n After the Czech Republic sent substantial \r\nhumanitarian aid, it initiated an international support \r\nconference for Georgia, to be held next month in \r\nBrussels. We call upon the international community to \r\nhelp alleviate the suffering of the tens of thousands of \r\npeople displaced by the conflict, as well as to help the \r\ncountry with post-conflict reconstruction. We insist \r\nthat all internally displaced persons return home. The \r\nimmediate task is to ensure that all military forces are \r\nwithdrawn to pre-war positions. There is urgent need \r\nfor the deployment of an international and impartial \r\nmission in Georgia to oversee the military withdrawals \r\nand ceasefire implementation. Let me stress once \r\nagain, however, that a peaceful and lasting solution to \r\nthe conflict must be based on full respect for the \r\nprinciple of Georgia’s independence, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. \r\n We need to step up efforts to combat international \r\nterrorism. The stakes remain high. With our deep \r\ncondolences to the peoples of India and Pakistan, we \r\nstrongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks in New \r\nDelhi and Islamabad. We must not be shaken, but must \r\nstand up to that scourge united, stronger and more \r\ndetermined. I was deeply moved by the condolences \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n33 08-53129 \r\n \r\nexpressed by my Pakistani counterpart. It is touching to \r\nhear that from someone whose country has suffered \r\nimmensely from terrorism. \r\n Promoting and maintaining international security \r\nrequires concerted action. While there is a need for \r\nstrengthened United Nations peacekeeping capacity, \r\nother organizations can effectively complement the \r\nwork of the United Nations in areas where they have a \r\ncomparative advantage. \r\n We have all felt the pains of stabilizing a war-torn \r\ncountry like Afghanistan. Despite the persisting lack of \r\nsecurity, the international community continues to \r\nsupport development even in remote areas. By \r\nestablishing and running the provincial reconstruction \r\nteam in Logar province, my country has undertaken a \r\nlong-term commitment to contribute to the security and \r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan. Let me express our full \r\nsupport for the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Afghanistan, Ambassador Kai Eide, and \r\ninvite the United Nations to take a more active \r\napproach and enhance its involvement and assistance \r\nto Afghanistan. The Afghans need our support to turn \r\nPresident Karzai’s words, “we must do what it takes to \r\nwin the battle of Afghanistan’s economic development” \r\n(A/63/PV.7), into reality. A concerted effort between the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan, the United Nations and \r\nother key international players, including Pakistan, is a \r\nprerequisite to achieving that goal. \r\n The cooperation of the United Nations, the \r\nEuropean Union and NATO needs to continue to the \r\nbenefit of the Balkan region as a whole. Looking into \r\nthe future, let me assure Members that both democratic \r\nand prosperous Serbia and Kosovo do have a place in \r\nthe European family and that the Czech Republic is \r\nready to lend them a helping hand. We in the Czech \r\nRepublic have always had long-standing and \r\ntraditionally close and friendly relations with Serbia \r\nand are keen to develop them further. \r\n The recent arrest and transfer of Radovan \r\nKaradzic to the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia was a promising sign of \r\ncooperation of the new Serbian Government with the \r\ninternational community. I call on the Security Council \r\nto provide sufficient time to the Tribunal for the \r\ncompletion of its work. \r\n The Czech Republic considers international \r\ncriminal justice to be one of the pillars that uphold the \r\nbasic values of the United Nations. The ad hoc \r\ntribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as \r\nwell as the Security Council decision of 2005 to refer \r\nthe situation in Darfur to the International Criminal \r\nCourt, must be supported in order to end impunity for \r\nthe most serious crimes. Let me recall the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s commitment at the opening of this general \r\ndebate: “We have the means to combat impunity and \r\nmust therefore do so” (A/63/PV.5, p. 3). \r\n We need to undertake some bold steps in the area \r\nof weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation. \r\nWe should reduce the risk of those weapons being \r\nmisused or falling into the hands of terrorists. The \r\nimmediate task is to ensure a successful outcome of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nreview process and the entry into force of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \r\n In that context, I would like to express our \r\nconcern over the Iranian and North Korean nuclear \r\nprogrammes. We fully recognize the indispensable \r\nright of every country to exploit nuclear power for \r\ncivilian purposes, but we should act when it could be \r\ndiverted towards military purposes, in breach of \r\ninternational commitments. \r\n My country was among those that has vigorously \r\ncalled for a new universal norm to prevent risks \r\nstemming from the use of cluster munitions. The Czech \r\nRepublic will be among the first to sign the new \r\nConvention on Cluster Munitions this December. I am \r\nconvinced that the more countries that join the \r\nConvention, the more profound and positive the effect \r\nit will have on the lives of countless individuals and \r\ncommunities. \r\n Security goes hand in hand with development and \r\nhuman rights. In the sixtieth year of the existence of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is \r\nstill a long way to go from the merely formal \r\ncommitments of Governments to achieving a \r\nuniversally shared respect for the rights and liberties of \r\nevery human being. \r\n In recent years, the United Nations human rights \r\ninstitutions have undergone long-awaited reform. \r\nHowever, our goals have been only partially achieved. \r\nLet me express my deep regret that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has been unable to tackle several serious \r\nhuman rights situations in a timely and proper manner. \r\nAlthough the Council is putting meritorious effort into \r\nthe newly established Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism, the political imbalance of its agenda and \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 34 \r\n \r\nthe attempts to weaken the role of special procedures \r\nand non-governmental organizations further diminish \r\nthe expectations of reform. Moreover, flouting the \r\nappeals of the international community, as was done by \r\nthe Myanmar regime, has to be denounced.  \r\n The Czech Republic supports the principle of \r\nresponsibility to protect formulated at the 2005 World \r\nSummit. The international community has the \r\nresponsibility to protect peoples worldwide in cases \r\nwhere their Governments are unable or unwilling to do \r\nso. Just over the past few years, we have seen some \r\nquite tragic examples desperately requiring our \r\nattention. I therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts to advance that issue. A valuable contribution \r\ncan also be made through the non-governmental \r\ninitiatives of leaders such as Václav Havel, Kjell \r\nMagne Bondevik and Elie Wiesel. Earlier this week, I \r\nhad the honour to host an event in New York aimed at \r\npresenting their thoughts and recommendations on the \r\ntragic human rights and humanitarian situation in \r\nNorth Korea. \r\n This week, I took part in high-level meetings on \r\nAfrica’s development needs and on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We have already witnessed early \r\nsuccesses and setbacks, and we realize that some goals \r\nare more difficult to achieve than others. Now, at the \r\nhalfway point to the target date, we are well aware of \r\nhow much needs to be done in the remaining seven \r\nyears. Our commitment to development, and notably to \r\nAfrica, must not wane. \r\n At the end of this year, the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment will present an opportunity to review the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus of 2002. \r\nThe conclusion of the ongoing talks on the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda within the World Trade \r\nOrganization should also bring the tangible benefits of \r\nfurther trade liberalization for developing countries. To \r\nmake that happen, the European Union has already \r\nshown the necessary flexibility. Other key actors have \r\nto follow suit if the talks are to get back on track and \r\nbe concluded soon. In that context, let me recall once \r\nagain the Czech presidency’s motto, “Europe without \r\nbarriers”. \r\n Let me assure the Assembly that the Czech \r\nRepublic fully supports the European Union (EU) \r\ncommitments to intensify EU development assistance. \r\nThe Czech presidency of the Union will be yet another \r\nincentive for us to step up our development assistance. \r\n Soaring food and commodity prices, as well as \r\nthe negative impact of climate change, hamper \r\ninternational development. All those issues require \r\nstrong political will. The new legal framework to \r\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012 is one \r\nof the most important issues. The Czech Republic is \r\nfully aware of the need to make significant progress \r\ntowards the adoption of a new post-Kyoto agreement. \r\nThe Czech presidency of the European Union will play \r\nan active role in that process, which will culminate in \r\nCopenhagen next year, where a new agreement should \r\nbe adopted. \r\n I have outlined just a few points that are awaiting \r\nour action. In many areas, time is running out. I would \r\nlike to encourage all Members of this universal \r\nOrganization to cooperate in our common efforts to \r\nmake this world secure and prosperous. The Czech \r\nRepublic is committed to doing its part. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rais Yatim, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Malaysia. \r\n Mr. Yatim (Malaysia): The Malaysian delegation \r\ncongratulates you, Mr. President, on your election as \r\nthe president of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. \r\n We are in a situation of unprecedented crisis. The \r\nskyrocketing prices of fuel and food have caused us \r\ndistress and widespread hardship. Beyond that, the \r\ncurrent financial and climate crises continue to tear the \r\nsocial fabric of Member States. To term it merely an \r\neconomic crisis is to understate the case. Indeed, the \r\nsheer complexity and connectivity between food, fuel \r\nand energy, between finance and climate change, make \r\nthe task of addressing those convergent crises so \r\nbedevilling.  \r\n It is here at the United Nations that the crises \r\nmust be faced and resolved. If we fail to address and \r\nremedy those calamities, our role and responsibility in \r\nthis body will be called into question. \r\n Some have called the current situation, \r\nparticularly the food crisis, a silent tsunami. I beg to \r\ndiffer. It has not been and is not silent. Instead, the \r\nrumblings have been heard for some time, most \r\nparticularly in Africa. In 1974, the international \r\ncommunity gathered in Rome to address the global \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n35 08-53129 \r\n \r\nfood crisis, and in 1996, again in Rome, we dedicated \r\nourselves at the World Food Summit to eliminating \r\nhunger and malnutrition and to achieving sustainable \r\nfood security for all.  \r\n We adopted seven commitments towards that end. \r\nIt was estimated in 1974 that, if action was not taken, \r\nthere could be 680 million hungry people in the world \r\nin 2010. The latest figure shows that, at present, \r\n850 million people face hunger on a daily basis. \r\nClearly, we have failed to take heed of the warnings \r\nmade 34 years ago. Can we now ask what happened to \r\nthose resolutions that we made? \r\n Liberalization has fundamentally changed the \r\nmarket structure for food and energy sources. Those \r\nchanges have allowed for greater international \r\nspeculation. A clear evidence of speculation on the \r\nprice of food can be found in the dramatic rise in \r\nprices. An increase of close to 40 per cent has been \r\nrecorded within a six-month period, in some cases. In \r\nview of the volatility of food prices, Malaysia strongly \r\nsupports efforts to promote agriculture and food \r\nproduction. \r\n It is generally assumed that rising food prices \r\nautomatically benefit all farmers equally. That is not \r\nthe case. Due to the concentrated and vertically \r\nintegrated nature of the global food trade, a good \r\nnumber of agribusiness companies control all aspects \r\nof cultivation and distribution. We are therefore now \r\nwitnessing smallholders being squeezed out. They are \r\nunable to benefit from rising prices. At the same time, \r\nironically, many have to purchase food items that are \r\navailable in the market at very high prices. \r\n The energy crisis has some of the same causes as \r\nthe food situation. Underinvestment is one of those \r\ncauses. Expectations of continued ample supply have \r\nbeen dashed due to speculation and increased demand. \r\nThe causes of the fuel, food and climate change crises \r\nclearly lie in the unfulfilled hopes and broken promises \r\nof sustainable development. In Rio almost a decade \r\nand a half ago, the human family agreed that we would \r\nundertake concerted action to address the sustainable \r\ndevelopment challenge based, inter alia, on the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.  \r\n Yet, we are facing a crisis that could have \r\ncatastrophic consequences. It would appear that we \r\nhave not learned the lessons of history or avoided the \r\nhabit of producing resolution after resolution minus the \r\nrequisite pursuit and follow-up. Indeed, that is the root \r\ncause of our stagnation in many areas of the \r\nOrganization’s responsibilities.  \r\n Therefore, the question is: what needs to be \r\ndone? Allow me to make six suggestions.  \r\n First, the international community, in particular \r\nthe developed world, should demonstrate greater \r\npolitical commitment. The focus of the countries of the \r\ndeveloped world should be on fulfilling their 2008-\r\n2012 commitments and, in so doing, setting a standard \r\nfor the entire world, rather than on trying to pass the \r\nburden of action on to the developing world. \r\n Secondly, we must find the right mix in balancing \r\nthe competing interests of the three pillars of \r\nsustainable development, namely, economic growth, \r\nsocial development and environmental protection.  \r\n Thirdly, the optimal mix between governmental \r\nand private-sector action must be found. Clearly, \r\nmarket forces and the private sector have a role to play \r\nin overcoming these convergent crises. However, the \r\nrole of the Government is critical in terms of providing \r\npolicy integration as well as balancing the competing \r\ninterests of the three pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Fourthly, further infrastructure development and \r\nthe transfer of technology are critical elements in \r\novercoming the present crises.  \r\n Fifthly, we must resolve long-standing issues that \r\nlie at the heart of world geopolitics today. In particular, \r\nwe must resolve the problems in the world’s most \r\nvolatile regions — which, coincidentally, are some of \r\nthe world’s largest producers and distribution channels \r\nof oil. The United Nations must make a forward thrust \r\nin meeting the need for peace and security. Energy and \r\nfood are truly needs of humanity. Therefore, the United \r\nNations must introduce a synergy of human rights into \r\nthe matter so that oil and food become basic rights of \r\nhumanity. \r\n And sixthly, long-term solutions must be found in \r\norder to stabilize the price of commodities. More \r\nparticularly, the futures market must be organized and \r\nduly regulated so that it becomes a force of stability, \r\nnot volatility, in prices. That must be coupled with \r\ncontinued research and development related to \r\nalternative energy, be it solar, nuclear or derivative \r\nfuel. \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 36 \r\n \r\n Malaysia recognizes certain realities. In the face \r\nof vehement protests, we have taken measures to \r\nreduce the level of fuel subsidies, which could have \r\nbeen untenable in the long run. We have also \r\nundertaken measures to reduce Government spending \r\nand to promote greater energy efficiency. Last July, \r\nleaders of the Developing 8 Countries, of which \r\nMalaysia is now Chair, agreed in Kuala Lumpur to \r\nmake serious efforts to cooperate in increasing \r\nagricultural production and achieving greater food \r\nsecurity. We urge the countries of the developed world \r\nto play their rightful greater role in addressing those \r\nconvergent crises, given their greater wealth and \r\ncapacities.  \r\n The present financial crisis being suffered by the \r\nUnited States threatens to engulf the entire world, \r\nalthough the vast majority of us did not enjoy the \r\nbenefits when times were good. Somehow, the \r\nfinancial mantra of the United States has lost its magic. \r\nCasting our minds back to the Asian financial crisis in \r\n1997, we cannot help but compare the scenarios. The \r\ntroubles of Asian companies then were the result of \r\noutside forces, while the present troubles of United \r\nStates financial companies are entirely of their own \r\ndoing. It must be asked: why were the actions taken by \r\nthe Governments of Asia — in particular, that of \r\nMalaysia — to save our own companies a decade ago \r\ndeemed so wrong, while the present bailout of United \r\nStates financial companies is deemed to be right? To \r\nensure that such a debacle does not recur, let us today \r\nresolve to check the excesses of the so-called financial \r\nwizards whose alchemy has resulted in so much \r\nsuffering. Malaysia supports the view that corporate \r\ncaptains should not sap their entities by receiving \r\nunbelievably high pay packages. \r\n New threats to peace and security continue to \r\npose additional challenges for the international \r\ncommunity. Terrorism, transnational crime and piracy \r\nare but a few of the challenges that confront us. \r\nAlready, the scourge of terrorism and piracy in \r\ninternational waters has taken its toll on many States. \r\nMalaysia, Japan and even Russia have become victims \r\nto acts of piracy thousands of miles away from their \r\nshores.  \r\n Just days ago, in August 2008, two Malaysian \r\nvessels were hijacked by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. \r\nSixty-five Malaysians and 15 Filipinos on board those \r\nvessels are being held hostage in Somalia. In order to \r\nsecure the release of the hostages and ensure the safe \r\nnavigation of our vessels in that area, Malaysia has \r\ntaken steps in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolution 1816 (2008) and international law. My \r\ndelegation stands ready to work closely with other \r\nStates that share the same predicament. We urge the \r\nSecurity Council to immediately address the problem \r\nin an effective manner. My delegation also calls on \r\nStates, particularly the littoral States in the region, to \r\nprovide the means necessary to ensure the security of \r\nnavigation in their waters. \r\n Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are \r\nthree important pillars of our political life. Those \r\npillars, enshrined in the Malaysian Constitution, have \r\nbequeathed to us freedom and liberty, dignity and \r\nharmony, peace and security. Malaysia will protect and \r\nstrengthen those sacrosanct pillars at all costs in order \r\nto ensure that all members of our multireligious and \r\nmulti-ethnic society can continue to live with one \r\nanother in peace, harmony and unity, while respecting \r\ndiversity. We believe that good and harmonious \r\nrelations among our various religious and ethnic \r\ngroups are our greatest asset. We respect the rule of \r\nlaw, and no one is above the law. \r\n Malaysia is concerned over recent attempts by \r\ncertain powerful Member States to question the \r\nnational laws of countries and the administration of \r\njustice under those laws. It needs to be restated: we \r\nhave no right to meddle — in any form or \r\nmanifestation, or under any pretext or circumstances — \r\nin the conduct of the internal affairs of other countries. \r\nIf we so chose, we could question the legal basis of the \r\nGuantánamo detentions without trial, but we have not \r\ndone so, inasmuch as we do not question societal \r\nbehaviour in other jurisdictions. While same-sex \r\nfornication and marriage are acceptable in California, \r\nthat does not mean that sodomy — which is a crime in \r\nmany countries in Asia — is to be impugned or \r\nderided.  \r\n Let us remind ourselves of the purposes and \r\nprinciples set out in the United Nations Charter, as well \r\nas of the relevant provisions of the 2000 Millennium \r\nDeclaration and the Outcome Document of the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, which should be defended and upheld.  \r\n Democracy in Malaysia remains very vibrant and \r\nprogressive. Basic rights continue to be guaranteed for \r\neach and every Malaysian citizen, and the rule of law \r\nvia parliament remains central to our existence as a \r\nsovereign and independent nation. \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n37 08-53129 \r\n \r\n It is here in the General Assembly that the entire \r\nworld comes together in a true spirit of common \r\nresolve and partnership. That presupposes the creation \r\nof an international order and a reformed United \r\nNations that reflect not only the current and future \r\nrealities, but also our resolve in fulfilling each and \r\nevery resolution that we have adopted here at the \r\nAssembly.  \r\n Indeed, it would be elementary at this juncture to \r\nanswer the question: to what extent have we fulfilled \r\nand satisfied the numerous resolutions that we have \r\nadopted over the decades? Indeed, what happens to the \r\nspeeches after speeches that leaders have made? Lest \r\nwe be blamed as a mere resolution-producing body, let \r\nus begin to act in concert to deliver the goods that we \r\nall should have delivered for the sake of the very \r\nhumanity that we are charged with safeguarding. Let us \r\nplan the work and subsequently work the plan. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Pak Kil Yon, Vice-Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Pak Kil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text provided by \r\nthe delegation): At the outset, on behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session. I also wish to express confidence \r\nthat, under your able stewardship, the current session \r\nwill be a success.  \r\n It is a centuries-long aspiration of mankind to live \r\nin a peaceful and prosperous world, free from war and \r\ndomination. Nearly 10 years have passed since the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), reflecting that common desire. \r\nNevertheless, a vicious circle of aggression and \r\nintervention, conflict and terrorism still persists within \r\ninternational relations, and, consequently, global peace \r\nand security continue to face serious new challenges. \r\n The military alliances in place throughout the \r\ncold war era are being further intensified, and arms \r\nraces in new forms are taking place in the Asia-Pacific, \r\nEuropean and other regions. Attempts to justify \r\nviolations of the sovereignty of developing countries \r\nunder the pretext of human rights, non-proliferation \r\nand the war on terror go ever-more undisguised. \r\nDisparities in wealth and imbalances in the level of \r\ndevelopment between the North and the South have \r\nbecome further deepened, foreshadowing gloomy \r\nprospects for the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in developing countries. The ever-\r\nworsening energy, food and financial crises of recent \r\ndays are seriously affecting the already vulnerable \r\neconomies of developing countries. \r\n Today’s realities require all Member States to \r\npool their efforts for the building of a just, peaceful \r\nand prosperous world as a matter of priority, as they \r\npledged in the Millennium Declaration. \r\n The building of a new world, free and peaceful, \r\nwithout domination, subjugation, aggression or war is a \r\ncommon aspiration of the world’s peoples and is now \r\nthe shared responsibility of humankind. Ongoing \r\nefforts to reform the United Nations and enhance its \r\nrole should be directed towards that end. It is also \r\nimperative to hold in check the attempts of some \r\nindividual countries to address critical international \r\nissues related to world peace and security solely with a \r\nview to their own interests. For that purpose, there is a \r\nneed to decisively enhance the authority of the General \r\nAssembly, in which all Member States exercise their \r\nequal rights. \r\n Aggression and interference in the internal affairs \r\nof sovereign States and acts committed under the cover \r\nof human rights protection should be completely \r\nrejected. Today, the worst peace-breaker and human \r\nrights violator in the world is none other than the \r\nUnited States, as evidenced by its armed invasion of \r\nsovereign countries and its unhesitating massacre of \r\ninnocent civilians. \r\n Human rights are sovereign and independent \r\nrights. We urge Member States to remain vigilant in the \r\nface of the constant clamouring by the United States \r\nand other Western countries on the subject of human \r\nrights protection and not to accept the politicization of, \r\nor selectivity and double standards in human rights. \r\n The main reason that the question of relations \r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand Japan has been unresolved for over half a century \r\nlies in Japan’s failure to liquidate its past, which is \r\nstained with large-scale crimes. Japan is the only war \r\ncriminal State that whitewashes the history of \r\naggression and massacre of millions of innocent people \r\nin Korea and other Asian countries and today attempts \r\nto grab the sacred Tok Islet of Korea. Such a country \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 38 \r\n \r\nshould never be permitted to become a permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council. \r\n No one aspires to peace more than the Korean \r\npeople, who suffered under Japanese military \r\noccupation for almost half a century and since have \r\nbeen in confrontation with the United States for over \r\n60 years. Even now, a series of reckless military \r\nmanoeuvres destabilizing the region, including through \r\nthe strengthening of strategic military alliances, \r\nmassive shipments of state-of-the-art war equipment \r\nand annual large-scale military exercises, are being \r\nconducted in and around the Korean peninsula. \r\n The Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military \r\nexercise, staged by the United States and the Republic \r\nof Korea this past August, under the pretext of what \r\nthey called “Preparation for an emergency on the \r\nKorean peninsula”, was nothing more than a war drill, \r\nfor all intents and purposes mounting a pre-emptive \r\nnuclear strike on the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. \r\n Double-faced approaches, such as talking about \r\ndialogue and resorting to war exercises against a \r\ndialogue partner behind the scenes, are a clear \r\nindication of the persistently hostile policy of the \r\nUnited States against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the confrontational policy of the \r\npresent South Korean regime. \r\n In the face of such military threats and danger of \r\nwar, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\nbeen strengthening in every possible way its self-\r\ndefence capability in order to safeguard its national \r\nsovereignty and peace. That choice and right of ours is \r\njust and legitimate and cannot be subject to criticism \r\nand blame by others. If the powerful deterrent to war \r\nsecured by the Songun policy of the respected General \r\nKim Jong Il had not existed, the Korean peninsula \r\nwould have already suffered catastrophes several times \r\nover, which would certainly have led to the complete \r\ndisruption of regional peace and stability as a whole. \r\n The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is \r\nthe lifetime instruction of President Kim Il Sung, the \r\ngreat leader of our people, and the Government of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea remains \r\nconsistent in its position of resolving the nuclear issue \r\npeacefully through dialogue and negotiations. The \r\nadoption of the North-South Joint Declaration on the \r\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in 1992 and \r\nof the Agreed Framework between the United States of \r\nAmerica and the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea in 1994 are a demonstration of the firm political \r\nwill of our Government to denuclearize the Korean \r\npeninsula. \r\n Thanks to our sincere endeavours, several rounds \r\nof the Six-Party Talks have been held to date, enabling \r\nthe adoption of the Joint Statement of 19 September \r\n2005, followed by the agreements on and \r\nimplementation of phased actions aimed at resolving \r\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.  \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nhonoured its commitments to the agreements of the \r\nSix-Party Talks in good faith. Nuclear facilities were \r\ndisabled at the final stage, a nuclear declaration was \r\nsubmitted and those measures envisaged for the \r\ndestruction phase were even implemented in advance.  \r\n That notwithstanding, the United States has laid \r\nan artificial obstacle to implementing the 3 October \r\nagreement by refusing to implement its obligations and \r\nput forward such an unjust demand as verification of \r\nan international standard never agreed on among the \r\nsix parties or between the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States.  \r\n The international standard asserted by the United \r\nStates is nothing but the special inspection that the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for \r\nin the 1990s to infringe upon the sovereignty of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, causing it \r\nultimately to pull out of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n The United States has now put on hold the \r\nimplementation of the procedure for de-listing the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea as a State \r\nsponsor of terrorism under the pretext of verification, \r\neven after having officially declared that the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is not a State \r\nsponsor of terrorism. That is little short of admitting \r\nthat the list is not actually related to terrorism.  \r\n As far as verification is concerned, it is a \r\ncommitment to be fulfilled by the six parties during the \r\nfinal phase of the denuclearization of the entire Korean \r\npeninsula, in accordance with the 19 September Joint \r\nStatement. The United States insistence on unilateral \r\ninspection of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea is a brigand-like demand to unilaterally disarm \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the other \r\nwarring party, by discarding its commitment to the \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n39 08-53129 \r\n \r\ndenuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula, the \r\ncore of which is the removal of the United States \r\nnuclear threat, in accordance with the 19 September \r\nJoint Statement. \r\n Now that the United States has broken the \r\nagreement, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nis inevitably taking relevant countermeasures based on \r\nthe principle of action for action. If the six parties are \r\nnot true to their word in carrying out their respective \r\nobligations because of their great lack of trust in one \r\nanother, no progress will be made at all. That is a \r\nlesson drawn from the process of previous Six-Party \r\nTalks. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\ncontinue to make every sincere effort to achieve the \r\ndenuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula, but we \r\nwill not be indifferent to an attempt to offend our \r\ndignity and self-respect and to violate our sovereignty. \r\n As members are well aware, inter-Korean \r\nrelations have been worsening ever since the \r\ninstallation of the new regime in South Korea, which \r\nrejects the North-South joint declaration of 15 June \r\n2000 and the declaration of 4 October 2007. \r\nResolutions were adopted by consensus at previous \r\nGeneral Assembly sessions supporting the historic \r\nNorth-South summits held in Pyongyang in 2000 and \r\n2007 and the 15 June 2000 joint declaration and the \r\n4 October 2007 declaration resulting from them. As \r\nstipulated in those resolutions, the 15 June joint \r\ndeclaration and programme of action and the 4 October \r\ndeclaration constitute major milestones that could \r\nshorten the process of improving inter-Korean relations \r\nand achieving independent national reunification in the \r\nnew century, as well as a grand programme for Korean \r\nreunification that clearly reflects the demands of the \r\ntimes and the aspirations of the nation. \r\n Those declarations enjoy the unanimous support \r\nnot only of the entire Korean people, but also of the \r\ninternational community as a whole, as they are most \r\ncomprehensive and realistic in their content and \r\ninclude all previous inter-Korean agreements, \r\nincluding the joint statement of 4 July 1972, which \r\nclarifies the three principles of independence, peaceful \r\nreunification and great national unity. \r\n It is intolerable that the declarations agreed upon \r\nand adopted at the highest level in the North and the \r\nSouth and supported unanimously by the international \r\ncommunity are now being disregarded simply because \r\nof the changed regime in South Korea. The \r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea will continue to seek national reconciliation and \r\nunity by fully implementing the 15 June joint \r\ndeclaration and the 4 October declaration, launching a \r\nnew era of independent reunification, peace and \r\nprosperity and doing its utmost to ensure durable peace \r\nand stability on the Korean peninsula. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now \r\ncall on those representatives who wish to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat, in accordance with General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\n5 minutes for the second and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): This \r\nmorning, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United \r\nArab Emirates raised some unacceptable, futile and \r\nunfounded claims about the three Iranian islands \r\nlocated in the Persian Gulf, namely, Abu Musa and the \r\ntwo Tunbs. The Islamic Republic of Iran categorically \r\nrejects those claims and wishes to emphasize that those \r\nthree islands are eternal parts of the Iranian territory \r\nand consequently are under Iranian sovereignty.  \r\n The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, \r\nwhile stressing its determination to have good and \r\nbrotherly relations with its neighbour the United Arab \r\nEmirates, reiterates that all actions and measures on the \r\nIranian island of Abu Musa have been taken in exercise \r\nof the sovereign rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nand in accordance with the arrangements emanating \r\nfrom the documents exchanged in 1971. The Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran stands ready to continue its bilateral \r\ntalks with the relevant officials of the United Arab \r\nEmirates with a view to removing any \r\nmisunderstanding that may exist in that regard.  \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nexercise its right of reply in response to the statement \r\nmade by the representative of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. That statement is entirely \r\ngroundless, and we cannot accept it.  \r\n Japan has been facing up to its past with sincerity \r\nand consistency. Japan has officially expressed a sense \r\nof remorse and apology many times since the end of \r\nthe Second World War. With that in mind, Japan has, \r\nfor more than 60 years, consistently dedicated itself to \r\npromoting international peace and prosperity and \r\ndemonstrated its respect for democracy and human \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 40 \r\n \r\nrights. Japan has adhered consistently and exclusively \r\nto a defensive security policy based on the principle \r\nthat it should never become a military Power, and we \r\nhave adhered to the position that international \r\nproblems have to be resolved not militarily, but always \r\npeacefully.  \r\n It must be noted that Japan has sincerely \r\naddressed this issue in the past and continues to do so. \r\nIt must also be noted that Japan has served as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council nine \r\ntimes since it joined the United Nations, some 50 years \r\nago. We are of the view that Japan has been making \r\npositive contributions to international peace and \r\nsecurity by discharging our responsibility as a member \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n With regard to Japan’s position on Security \r\nCouncil reform, as we have publicly stated many times \r\nat the United Nations and in other forums, and as is \r\nwell known, Japan stands ready to contribute actively \r\nand constructively to international peace and security \r\nat any time. \r\n The fundamental policy of Japan remains \r\nunchanged. On the basis of the Pyongyang Declaration, \r\nJapan will normalize its relations with the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea through the settlement of \r\nthe unfortunate past and the comprehensive resolution \r\nof outstanding problems, including abductions and \r\nnuclear and missile issues.  \r\n Mr. Al-Barout (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I apologize for taking the floor at this late \r\nhour. I would like to reply to what the representative of \r\nIran just said. Those false claims regarding Iran’s \r\nsovereignty over the three islands, Abu Musa, greater \r\nTunb and lesser Tunb are unjust and illegal. My \r\ndelegation has always held an unswerving principled \r\nposition on those islands and reiterates its great \r\ndisappointment at what the representative of Iran has \r\njust repeated, as his delegation does every year.  \r\n The representative of Iran cannot falsify all the \r\ndemographic, political and historical truths, which \r\nshow that those islands belong to the Emirates. We \r\nhave never relinquished and will never relinquish our \r\nlegal, historical and political right to those islands, \r\nwhich are an integral part of our sovereign territory \r\nand our exclusive economic zone. We repeat that that \r\nterritory along with its continental shelf and airspace, \r\nis ours and cannot be divided. We categorically \r\nrepudiate all the false claims and illegal measures \r\nundertaken by Iran concerning those islands. We base \r\nour position on the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law.  \r\n We repeat our appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to urge Iran to show its peaceful good \r\nintentions in the region by entering into unconditional \r\nbilateral negotiations between our two countries \r\nregarding the occupation of the islands, or by taking \r\nthe matter to the International Court of Justice to bring \r\nabout a solution, as is the practice in other cases.  \r\n We reiterate that stability and economic progress \r\nin the Arabian Gulf require good-neighbourly relations \r\nin line with the principles of respect for the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of States and non-interference \r\nin their internal affairs. \r\n Mr. Pak Tok Hun (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): My delegation would like me to \r\nreply to the remarks made a moment ago by the \r\ndelegation of Japan. The Japanese representative’s \r\nremarks attempt to divorce black from white, as if \r\nJapan were doing something to redress its past crimes. \r\n In adopting the Pyongyang Declaration of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and Japan in \r\nSeptember 2002, both Governments agreed to redress \r\nJapan’s past crimes against the Korean people during \r\nthe Japanese occupation of Korea, the issue of missing \r\nJapanese and other pending matters. As part of its \r\nefforts to implement the Declaration, the Government \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea dealt \r\nwith solving that issue sincerely and with great \r\ngenerosity. In keeping with the Pyongyang Declaration, \r\nupon the request of the Japanese Government we made \r\ninvestigations into the missing persons of Japan, and \r\nwe informed the Japanese Government that, of the \r\n13 Japanese war abductees, we sent the five surviving \r\nabductees and all their children to Japan after \r\ninforming the Japanese Government. \r\n Recently, in the last month, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and Japan agreed to \r\nundertake another investigation into that issue. So far, \r\nwe have done everything we can, and we will do our \r\nbest to solve the issue. \r\n However, Japan has not shown any tangible \r\nwillingness whatsoever to fulfil its responsibility \r\nproperly to redress its past crime. Japan has refused to \r\nhonestly admit to and repent of the heinous crimes it \r\ncommitted against humanity during the illegal military \r\n A/63/PV.14\r\n \r\n41 08-53129 \r\n \r\noccupation of Korea in the past and has persistently \r\nevaded responsibility for those crimes, although the old \r\ncentury has been replaced by a new one. \r\n In his remarks a few minutes ago, the Japanese \r\nrepresentative said that Japan repented sincerely, but in \r\nfact we are very concerned about the irresponsible \r\nremarks distorting the historical facts — the crimes \r\ncommitted by Japan. Very often, high officials of the \r\nJapanese Government distort the real facts. For \r\nexample, on 4 March 2007, the then Japanese Prime \r\nMinister refused to admit Japan’s responsibility for the \r\nissue of comfort women by making reckless remarks, \r\nsuch as that there was no evidence proving the forcible \r\nrecruitment of comfort women for the imperial \r\nJapanese army. It is a historical fact that Japan forced \r\n200,000 young Korean women into sexual slavery for \r\nits imperial army. Is there any such army in the world \r\nin the history of war that took girls and young women \r\nas their sexual slaves? It is only Japan.  \r\n On 25 March 2007, Japan’s Deputy Cabinet \r\nMinister asserted that there were nurses or journalists \r\nfor the Japanese army, but no comfort women, and that \r\nthere were prostitutes who were sold by parents. Such \r\nirresponsible remarks come out very often. I do not \r\nwant to talk any further about the crimes committed by \r\nJapan.  \r\n He mentioned the few Japanese abducted — a \r\nfew more than 10 Japanese. But that is the tip of the \r\niceberg compared to the great crime against humanity \r\ncommitted by Japan in the past, including the massacre \r\nof 1 million Korean people, forced labour of 8.4 \r\nmillion Koreans and sexual slavery of 200,000 Korean \r\nwomen for the Japanese army. But Japan has been \r\nevading its responsibility for the crime for more than \r\n60 years.  \r\n For Japan to honestly settle its criminal past \r\nwould be to win the trust of all the people and become \r\na member of the international community with a clear \r\nconscience. Japan had better discard its wrong way of \r\nthinking and its stance and make a political decision to \r\nredeem its past, though belatedly. \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): My delegation will again \r\nhave to exercise its right of reply in response to the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.  \r\n Japan and the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea held working level consultations in June and \r\nAugust 2008. At those consultations, the two sides \r\nagreed on what the aim and concrete modality of a \r\ncomprehensive investigation on the abduction issue to \r\nbe conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. However, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea later notified Japan that it would not conduct the \r\ninvestigation until it could ascertain the position of the \r\nnew Administration of Japan on the agreement reached \r\nat the working consultations. Japan strongly hopes that \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\nestablish an investigation committee with the necessary \r\nauthority and that it will commence the investigation \r\nsoon. \r\n Regarding the Japanese past, as I said earlier, \r\nJapan has been facing up to its past with sincerity and \r\nconsistency. However, the numbers that the delegation \r\nof Democratic People’s Republic of Korea cites as \r\nthose killed and murdered are totally groundless. It is \r\nsimply not possible to justify ongoing violations of \r\nhuman rights with such a groundless allegation. \r\n About the comfort women, we have to say that, \r\non that issue, the Government of Japan continues to \r\nadhere to the position expressed by Chief Cabinet \r\nSecretary Yohei Kono in his statement of 4 August \r\n1993, in which the Government of Japan extended its \r\n“Sincere apologies and remorse”.  \r\n Again, it must be noted that Japan has been \r\nseriously addressing the issue of its past history. \r\n Mr. Pak Tok Hun (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): I am sorry to take the floor again. \r\nThe Japanese representative has just said that the \r\nfigures I gave were groundless. But Japan refuses to \r\nreveal all the facts and figures it holds in its archives. \r\nWe requested, on numerous occasions, that Japan \r\nreveal all those documents. Since he said that the \r\nfigure I gave is groundless, I will give the exact \r\nnumbers we have got so far: 7,784,839 Koreans were \r\ndrafted for forced labour without knowing their \r\ndestination, and 200,000 Korean teenagers, girls and \r\nwomen were forced to serve the Imperial Japanese \r\nArmy as comfort women.  \r\n Well, it took half a century for Japan to admit its \r\ncrime in Korea. No one knows how long it will take for \r\nJapan to liquidate the crime. My delegation would like \r\nto urge Japan and to remind Japan that without \r\nthorough elimination of the past crime, a clear future \r\nfor Japan cannot be expected. Whatever pretext Japan \r\nputs forward to justify its crime, the fact remains that \r\nJapan illegally drafted millions of Korean people to \r\nA/63/PV.14  \r\n \r\n08-53129 42 \r\n \r\nforced labour as well as sexual slavery. But it still \r\nrefuses to redress those crimes of the past. \r\n The President in the Chair. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to draw \r\nthe attention of the General Assembly to document  \r\n \r\nA/INF/63/4, which contains the programme of work of \r\nthe Assembly and the schedule of plenary meetings for \r\nthe period from October to December 2008. I wish also \r\nto inform members that the lists of speakers for the \r\nitems listed in document A/INF/63/4 are open.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 7.35 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
