(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Ms. Ochir \r\n(Mongolia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic. \r\n Mr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): First, let me express, on behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, a veteran diplomat of Nicaragua, on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session. I trust that, with him at the helm, \r\nthe work of the General Assembly is in good hands.  \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is of the \r\nbelief that the United Nations remains an important \r\nand pre-eminent forum for addressing issues related to \r\ninternational cooperation for economic development, \r\npeace and security, human rights and the rule of law, \r\nbased on dialogue, cooperation and consensus-building \r\namongst States. For over half a century, the United \r\nNations has played a crucial role in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security and in promoting the \r\nsocio-economic advancement of Member States, \r\nespecially developing countries.  \r\n Yet, as the world situation becomes ever more \r\ncomplex and unpredictable, the United Nations \r\nincreasingly needs more robust and effective \r\ninstitutions. In our opinion, United Nations reform \r\nmust be comprehensive, transparent, inclusive and \r\nbalanced. We must strengthen the role and authority of \r\nthe General Assembly and revitalize its work.  \r\n We must also reform the Security Council, \r\nturning it into a more democratic and representative \r\norgan comprising new permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers alike. No less important is the need to \r\nsubstantially reinforce the development pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations, which include the Department of \r\nEconomic and Social Affairs, the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development, the regional \r\ncommissions and the United Nations Development \r\nAccount, enabling them to better support developing \r\ncountries. \r\n In that context, we commend Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon’s reform efforts aimed at transforming \r\nthe United Nations into a more responsive, dynamic, \r\nmultifunctional and effective Organization. The \r\nSecretary-General’s personal dedication to the cause of \r\npeace, and his endeavours in search of solutions to the \r\nthree global crises of finance, fuel and food deserve \r\nspecial recognition. \r\n The current difficult and complex situation in the \r\nfield of disarmament continues to be a cause of \r\nconcern. We recognize the threat posed by the \r\ncontinuing existence of nuclear weapons. It is hence \r\nincumbent upon the nuclear-weapon States to honour \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 2 \r\n \r\ntheir unequivocal commitment to work towards the \r\ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons. Renewed efforts \r\nare needed to resolve the impasse in achieving nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects. \r\n While globalization brings with it numerous \r\nopportunities for economic development, the obstacles \r\nthat the world faces deserve significant attention. \r\nDeveloping countries, in particular the most vulnerable \r\ngroup of countries — the least developed countries \r\nlandlocked developing countries and small island \r\ndeveloping States — have taken important steps to \r\nfurther integrate themselves into the global economy. \r\nNevertheless, those countries remain beleaguered by \r\nbasic infrastructure of poor quality, limited access to \r\nmarkets, capital and new technology, and low supply of \r\nfinance and investment. \r\n The sudden increase in oil and food prices has led \r\nto a period of economic instability in many countries. \r\nTo combat that problem, we stress the need for the full \r\nand effective implementation of the Rome Declaration \r\non World Food Security and the establishment of a \r\nglobal food bank and an international food fund to \r\nensure long-term food security for developing \r\ncountries, particularly the most vulnerable among \r\nthem.  \r\n In addition, the great untapped potential of those \r\ncountries should be explored and exploited to the \r\nmaximum extent through increased investment and \r\ntechnology transfer by developed countries and other \r\ndevelopment partners for mutual benefit.  \r\n The goal of achieving peace and prosperity \r\nremains the highest priority of the international \r\ncommunity, yet inter-State conflict, terrorism and \r\nunlawful unilateral sanctions and interventions \r\ncontinue to impede that goal. We are greatly distressed \r\nby the persistent conflict that has plagued the lives of \r\nthe peoples of the Middle East for decades, particularly \r\nof the Palestinian people, who have been fighting to \r\nexercise their right to self-determination and \r\nStatehood.  \r\n We are deeply saddened by the number of \r\ncasualties and the material damage inflicted upon the \r\nnations of Iraq and Afghanistan. We remain troubled by \r\nthe embargo that has been imposed on the Republic of \r\nCuba by the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica, an act that is clearly illegal and not \r\nresponsive to the legitimate interests of the peoples of \r\neither nation. In that regard, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic sincerely urges the parties \r\nconcerned in the aforementioned conflicts to seek ways \r\nto peacefully resolve their differences. It is our fervent \r\nhope that the peoples living in those conflict-affected \r\nareas may enjoy peace and prosperity as swiftly as \r\npossible. \r\n Unlike most calamities, global warming affects \r\nnot only the livelihood of every being on the planet, \r\nbut also the course of human history. Climate change \r\nwill become all the more worrisome as it leads to many \r\nother social and economic problems in addition to \r\nthose faced by our world today. That is why there is a \r\nneed for immediate global action to address climate \r\nchange in accordance with the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. In formulating policies \r\nto confront climate change, we should promote the \r\nintegration of all three components of sustainable \r\ndevelopment — economic development, social \r\ndevelopment and environmental protection. In that \r\nrespect, we call for the full implementation of the Bali \r\nRoad Map. \r\n As widely expressed at the high-level event on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the lack \r\nof effective implementation of the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the MDGs, \r\nremains of deep concern. Therefore, the highest \r\npriority should be given to securing the effective and \r\nfull implementation of the agreed goals and \r\ncommitments. In that context, we underscore the \r\nurgency of addressing the special needs of least \r\ndeveloped and landlocked developing countries \r\nthrough the full, timely and effective implementation \r\nby all stakeholders of the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction and the Almaty Programme of Action, as called \r\nfor in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. \r\n Landlocked developing countries face a unique \r\nimpediment in not having access to the sea. \r\nInternational cooperation is crucial to the success of \r\nthe development goals of those countries. We therefore \r\nwould like to stress the significance of the upcoming \r\nmidterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action, to \r\nbe held on 2 and 3 October 2008 here in New York, \r\nwhich should provide the international community with \r\nthe opportunity to assess progress made, lessons \r\nlearned and constraints encountered in the \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n As a member country, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic is gratified to witness the \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n3 08-53135 \r\n \r\ncontinuing stability resulting from strengthened and \r\nenhanced integration of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), which is an important \r\ncontribution to the maintenance of peace and further \r\ncooperation in the region and the world. A recent \r\nmomentous and milestone event was the signing of the \r\nASEAN Charter, which has transformed ASEAN into a \r\nrule-based regional organization. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic continues \r\nto enjoy solid political stability and social order. Thus, \r\nour socio-economic development has registered \r\nsignificant achievements, as reflected in the high and \r\nsustained growth of our gross domestic product. \r\nNotwithstanding those achievements, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic still faces impediments. Rising \r\noil prices, inflation and the global economic slowdown \r\nall stand in the way of our path to economic prosperity. \r\n This year, we have also experienced severe \r\nflooding that has inflicted huge material losses \r\nnationwide. Yet, in spite of all that, by improving the \r\nquality of basic infrastructure and human resources and \r\ncooperating with international partners, we are \r\ndetermined to pursue our twin strategies of poverty \r\neradication and regional integration. At the current \r\npace, we hope to extricate our country from the \r\nshackles of underdevelopment by the year 2020. \r\n I cannot conclude without reaffirming that \r\ndevelopment remains central and must come first if \r\npeace and respect for human rights, which are \r\nintertwined, are to be achieved. The Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic reiterates its unshakable \r\ncommitment to continued full cooperation with the \r\ninternational community in pursuit of a world free \r\nfrom fear and want, and rooted in a new, just and \r\nequitable order. Together, I am sure, we will be able to \r\nreach new heights. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Rashid Meredov, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nTurkmenistan. \r\n Mr. Meredov (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nI warmly greet and congratulate the members of the \r\nAssembly as we begin our work at the sixty-third \r\nsession.  \r\n First of all, I would like to convey to \r\nrepresentatives and the peoples of their countries the \r\nwishes for peace and prosperity of His Excellency \r\nGurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, President of \r\nTurkmenistan. Allow me to congratulate the esteemed \r\nPresident, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, on his \r\nelection to that high and responsible post and to wish \r\nhim success in organizing the fruitful work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this sixty-third session. Allow me \r\nalso to thank Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his successful \r\nleadership of the Assembly at its previous session and \r\nfor his active collaboration with the delegations. \r\n The United Nations, which is mandated to discuss \r\nand resolve issues relating to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, is currently at one of \r\nthe most critical moments in its history. That is \r\nespecially evident against the background of current \r\ndevelopments at the global and regional levels. The \r\ndiversity of contemporary challenges and threats calls \r\nfor the adequate preparation of a whole range of \r\napproaches to prevent them through cooperation among \r\nall Member States.  \r\n Today, we need solid measures to counter and \r\nfight such global challenges as international terrorism, \r\nhuman trafficking, organized crime, illegal drug \r\ntrafficking and the threat of the proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction. We are also witnessing \r\nthe effects of climate change and environmental \r\ndegradation. On top of that, the world community is \r\nfacing global issues relating to energy and food \r\nsecurity. \r\n Turkmenistan is a principled and active \r\nparticipant in the process to identify joint actions \r\naimed at resolving the most pressing problems of our \r\ntime. In that context, we regard the need to intensify \r\ninternational action to ensure peace and security as a \r\npriority task. The fight against terrorism is one of the \r\nmost important aspects of that problem. \r\n Turkmenistan, as a party to major United Nations \r\ninstruments to combat international terrorism and \r\norganized crime, supports the Organization’s efforts to \r\ndevelop a global strategy to fight terrorism and stands \r\nready to provide its practical assistance to the \r\ninternational community in that regard. \r\n The non-proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction is a pressing issue on the international \r\nagenda that is connected with ensuring peace and \r\nsecurity. Our country plays an active role in identifying \r\nnon-proliferation measures and takes practical steps for \r\ntheir implementation at the national and international \r\nlevels. As a party to the Treaty on the \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 4 \r\n \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and other very \r\nimportant international legal instruments in that sphere, \r\nTurkmenistan has joined international initiatives aimed \r\nat preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\n In that connection, the signing of the Treaty on a \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, which was \r\nprepared and adopted under the aegis of the United \r\nNations in 2006, has become an important element in \r\nthe efforts of the world community to resolve the issue. \r\n Today, we must all take a fresh look at the \r\nexisting system for maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. The current situation and emerging trends call \r\nfor an adequate approach and the formulation of \r\ncomprehensive measures, and the community of \r\nnations should take part in their implementation. I am \r\nconfident that ongoing discussions and deliberations at \r\nthis session will provide us with an opportunity to take \r\nstock of the entire panorama of the contemporary \r\nworld through the prism of ensuring a safe life for \r\nStates and peoples.  \r\n Undoubtedly, the General Assembly will help to \r\nconsolidate efforts of Member States for the effective \r\nimplementation of such measures. Turkmenistan \r\nsupports close cooperation with the United Nations in \r\nadopting comprehensive measures for collective \r\ninteraction to address the most pressing issues of our \r\ntimes. In that connection, we believe it necessary to \r\nconsider qualitatively new factors in ensuring security.  \r\n Energy security has become an integral \r\ncomponent of the global security system. The \r\navailability and accessibility of fuel and energy \r\nresources, their free delivery to international markets \r\nand effective use by consumers have become major \r\nfactors in the development of the world economy as a \r\nwhole.  \r\n As a major oil and natural gas producer, \r\nTurkmenistan holds a prominent place in the global \r\nenergy system. In that connection, we take a highly \r\nresponsible approach to developing international \r\ncooperation on the basis of our national interests and \r\nthe needs of our partners. Turkmenistan’s policy, of \r\ndiversifying supplies of hydrocarbon materials and \r\nensuring energy security has become an important \r\nfactor in that approach. It is apparent that major \r\ninvestments are needed to develop an effective and \r\nstable system of global energy security and that a \r\nconsiderable share of those investments should be \r\ndirected towards the transportation of hydrocarbons \r\nand the protection of energy infrastructure. In order to \r\nensure adequate supplies to the world energy markets, \r\nwe will also need a highly developed infrastructure of \r\ninternational pipeline networks. \r\n At the same time, ensuring energy security is not \r\nsimply a matter of increasing the pace of hydrocarbon \r\nextraction, developing new deposits or expanding the \r\ninfrastructure for transporting and delivering energy \r\nsupplies to end users. We must take into account other \r\nfactors of that system, such as political stability, the \r\nsituation in world markets and the presence of security \r\nguarantees for international pipelines.  \r\n Adequate security for energy infrastructure \r\nfacilities also implies a decrease in their vulnerability \r\nto the impact of natural and man-made disasters, \r\npotential risks connected to changes in the military and \r\npolitical situation in certain regions of the world, \r\nthreats from international terrorists, and the \r\nunauthorized siphoning of transported energy \r\nresources. Such problems often interrupt or reduce \r\nsupplies of fuel, in particular oil and natural gas, and \r\nresult in major financial losses and higher prices for \r\nenergy supplies, with a negative impact on the \r\ndevelopment of the world economy. \r\n Therefore, it has become increasingly urgent to \r\ncoordinate the efforts of States to establish a unified \r\nsystem of energy security. To that end, we must \r\ndevelop an appropriate international legal framework \r\nand effective partnership mechanisms, including for \r\nthe protection of energy transportation systems. It \r\nappears that this problem affects us all, be they energy \r\nproducers, transit countries or consumers. \r\n On that basis, Turkmenistan has launched an \r\ninitiative aimed at elaborating, under United Nations \r\nauspices, a unique document defining the legal basis \r\nand security guarantees for the functioning of \r\ninternational pipelines. As a preliminary step towards \r\nimplementing that initiative, Turkmenistan has \r\nprepared a draft resolution on the reliability of energy \r\ntransit and its role in ensuring stable economic \r\ndevelopment and international cooperation, which is \r\nbeing proposed for consideration at the sixty-third \r\nsession of the Assembly. Support for that draft \r\nresolution may provide a good stepping stone for the \r\nfuture and demonstrate the principled readiness of the \r\nworld community seriously to resolve those issues. In \r\nthat context, Turkmenistan is prepared to organize in \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n5 08-53135 \r\n \r\n2009 an international conference on that problem under \r\nUnited Nations auspices in Ashgabat, our country’s \r\ncapital. \r\n This year has witnessed an important event in the \r\nlife of Central Asia that, I believe, may have a \r\nconsiderable positive impact on the situation in the \r\nregion. I mean by that the commencement of the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations Regional Centre for \r\nPreventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. The \r\ninauguration of the Centre gave an impetus to the new \r\nstage of strategic partnership of Central Asian \r\ncountries with the United Nations in undertaking a set \r\nof measures aimed at preventing conflicts and \r\neliminating their underlying causes. \r\n We consider the inauguration of the Centre as \r\ntestimony of the great attention that the world \r\ncommunity devotes to the processes occurring in \r\nCentral Asia, clear understanding of the role and \r\nimportance of our region in global international affairs \r\nand a desire to provide utmost positive assistance in \r\ntackling regional problems. In the long run, that \r\nactivity will be aimed at achieving the long-term goal \r\nof ensuring the security, stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the States and peoples of the Central \r\nAsian region. \r\n Moreover, we believe that close interaction of \r\nneighbouring countries is one of the most decisive \r\nfactors. In that context, by closely adhering to its \r\ninternational obligations as a permanently neutral \r\nState, Turkmenistan stands for developing good-\r\nneighbourly cooperation with all the countries of the \r\nregion. \r\n In that connection, Turkmenistan provides \r\neconomic and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan \r\nand actively supports the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to restore peaceful life in that fraternal \r\ncountry. We would like to see Afghanistan as a \r\npeaceful and prosperous nation, a good neighbour and \r\npartner of all the States in the region. \r\n The issue of the Caspian Sea has acquired special \r\nrelevance in the context of regional stability and \r\neconomic cooperation. Moreover, its comprehensive \r\nconsideration envisages the solution of problems \r\nrelating to the establishment of an international legal \r\nbasis for cooperation, as well as large-scale \r\ndevelopment of the geo-economic potential of the \r\nCaspian region as a major energy basin and \r\ntransportation crossroads between East and West, \r\nSouth and North. For some States in the region that do \r\nnot have direct access to international sea \r\ncommunications, the Caspian Sea is the most important \r\nroute to the world markets. \r\n In that regard, effective activity in the Caspian \r\nSea is directly linked to the enhancement of security in \r\nthe adjacent region. Turkmenistan advocates that the \r\nCaspian area should be a zone of peace, stability and \r\neffective international cooperation on the basis of \r\nmutual respect and a partnership of equality. \r\n Being an integral part of the international \r\ncommunity, Turkmenistan sees its future in the \r\ndevelopment of a truly democratic society, in which \r\nevery individual person, his or her rights and freedoms \r\nand the all-round development of his or her potential \r\nrepresent the main value and measure of the country’s \r\nprogress. Just a few days ago, Turkmenistan witnessed \r\na major political event — the adoption of the new \r\nversion of its constitution, which laid down the legal \r\nbasis for the development of national statehood and the \r\nfurther democratization of social life. In particular, the \r\nconstitution considerably broadens the powers of the \r\nparliament as the country’s main legislative body. In \r\naddition, it expands the role of local bodies of \r\ngovernment and self-government, in whose work \r\ncitizens take an active part on a broad representative \r\nbasis.  \r\n Democratization is a natural process of \r\ndevelopment of any State and society, and in that \r\nconnection, the strengthening of a democratic, secular \r\nand law-based State is our own conscientious sovereign \r\ndecision, and we will steadfastly follow this course. \r\n The foreign policy of Turkmenistan is determined \r\nby the national interests of our State and its people, and \r\nits main goal is civilized development on the basis of \r\npositive integration into global political and economic \r\nprocesses. Therefore, cooperation with the United \r\nNations is the strategic direction of our foreign policy, \r\nand the principles enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter serve for us as the basis for the development of \r\nTurkmenistan’s relations with other States. \r\n We view the United Nations as a universal \r\ninternational organization, serving as the main \r\nguarantor of the global security system and the \r\nframework of the present and future world order. We \r\nadvocate that international law and the United Nations \r\nCharter and their principles of respect for the \r\nsovereignty of every nation and its choice of its own \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 6 \r\n \r\nway of development and non-interference in internal \r\naffairs should remain the basis of the world order and \r\nthe alpha and omega of relations among nations. \r\n On that basis, Turkmenistan determines its view \r\nto its partnership with the United Nations and states its \r\ninterest in strengthening and expanding its role in the \r\nsystem of international relations, especially with regard \r\nto the consolidation of the efforts of Member States to \r\nensure peace and security on Earth. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Andrei Stratan, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and European \r\nIntegration of the Republic of Moldova. \r\n Mr. Stratan (Republic of Moldova): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMiguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the high \r\nand responsible position of the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session and to pledge our \r\nfull support and assistance as Vice-President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n Our world is facing major problems and \r\nchallenges that demand a strengthened and revitalized \r\nOrganization capable of addressing global issues. From \r\nthat perspective, the Republic of Moldova fully \r\nsupports the United Nations reform process in \r\naccordance with the main directions reflected in the \r\nfinal document of the 2005 World Summit (resolution \r\n60/)1, subsequent initiatives of the Secretary-General \r\nand resolutions adopted on key aspects of the reform of \r\nthe Organization’s structures and management.  \r\n We support strengthening the coordinating role of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council in developing global \r\neconomic and social policies, promoting dialogue and \r\nintensifying cooperation with international financial, \r\neconomic and trade institutions and Governments in \r\nattaining the Millennium Development Goals, as well \r\nas the Council’s involvement in addressing \r\nhumanitarian crisis situations and issues related to \r\npost-conflict reconstruction. \r\n The decision to launch intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations will bring a new impetus to Security \r\nCouncil reform and will stimulate and increase the \r\nefficiency of United Nations activities in the field of \r\ninternational security and peacekeeping, including \r\nthrough developing cooperation with regional \r\norganizations and Member States in identifying \r\nsolutions to conflicts in different parts of the world. \r\n The events that occurred in South Ossetia, \r\nGeorgia, have proved once again that frozen conflicts \r\ngenerate instability and threaten regional and \r\ninternational security. The Republic of Moldova \r\nsubscribed to the European Union (EU) declaration \r\nregarding the degradation of the situation in South \r\nOssetia, delivered at the extraordinary meeting of the \r\nPermanent Council of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe on 8 August 2008, and calls \r\nfor the full implementation of the peace plan mediated \r\nunder the French presidency of the EU. At the same \r\ntime, categorically rejecting all methods of settlement \r\nby force, including those used to ensure territorial \r\nintegrity, the Moldovan Government does not consider \r\nthat international recognition of Abkhazia and South \r\nOssetia will stabilize the situation. \r\n In the specific case of the Transdniestrian \r\nconflict, the Republic of Moldova acted and continues \r\nto act in accordance with the law on basic provisions of \r\nthe special legal status of the localities on the left bank \r\nof the Nistru River which was adopted unanimously on \r\n22 July 2005 and which provides for resolution of the \r\nTransdniestrian conflict by political means only. \r\n Believing that demilitarization and \r\ndemocratization of the Transdniestrian region are \r\nessential to a viable resolution of the conflict, the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Moldova has advanced a \r\nnumber of initiatives on security for and confidence-\r\nbuilding between both banks of the Nistru River.  \r\n A strategy for conflict resolution based on a \r\ncomplex approach consisting of packaged proposals for \r\nall conflict-related issues — political, economic, social \r\nand humanitarian — has been adopted. It envisages a \r\nspecial legal status for the Transdniestrian region that \r\nincludes respect for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the Republic of Moldova, consolidation of \r\nthe neutrality status, withdrawal of foreign troops from \r\nthe country’s territory and recognition of ownership \r\nrights and firm guarantees for the population. \r\n At the same time, the activities of the European \r\nUnion Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and \r\nUkraine (EUBAM) and its close cooperation with the \r\nrelevant institutions in charge of border management in \r\nboth States have contributed to increased security and \r\ntransparency at the border, which creates a more \r\nfavourable atmosphere for settlement of the \r\nTransdniestrian conflict. At present our efforts, as well \r\nas those of mediators and observers, are directed to \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n7 08-53135 \r\n \r\nresuming negotiations in the Five plus two format with \r\na view to a final resolution of that conflict. \r\n The Assembly’s review meeting to assess the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, on 4 September 2008, emphasized \r\nboth the progress registered by the United Nations and \r\nits Member States during the last years and the \r\ndeficiencies in the fight against international terrorism. \r\nIn that context, I would like to reaffirm that as a party \r\nto 13 international conventions and other, regional and \r\nbilateral treaties in that field, the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova continues to take concrete steps \r\nin fighting terrorism in accordance with the provisions \r\nof those instruments, relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and national documents, including the \r\nNational Strategy for Preventing and Fighting Money- \r\nLaundering and Terrorism Funding.  \r\n The Republic of Moldova will further undertake \r\nall possible steps for contributing to United Nations \r\nactions in consolidating international legislation in the \r\nfield of countering international terrorism, especially in \r\nview of the finalizing of the development and adoption \r\nof the comprehensive convention on international \r\nterrorism and organization of the high-level conference \r\non terrorism under United Nations auspices. We \r\nconsider that in the framework of those activities, \r\nincreased attention should be given to the issues related \r\nto fighting terrorism that is fuelled by separatist \r\ntendencies that affect States’ sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity. \r\n Climate change is an inherent challenge for \r\nsustainable development. Global warming and its \r\neffects, including natural disasters and food and energy \r\ncrises, have become major threats for the global \r\npopulation and for international security. After the \r\nterrible drought of last year — the consequences of \r\nwhich we are still overcoming — the Republic of \r\nMoldova was hit this summer by the most serious \r\nfloods of the last two centuries, which affected over \r\n10,000 hectares of agricultural and private lands, \r\ndestroyed hundreds of houses and other buildings and \r\ncaused damages exceeding $120 million. \r\n We would like to express our gratitude for the \r\nassistance provided by the United Nations Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs by other \r\nspecialized institutions, including the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and UNICEF, and by \r\nMember States to alleviate the consequences of the \r\nfloods. \r\n The Republic of Moldova fully supports the \r\nactivity of the High-Level Task Force on the Global \r\nFood Security Crisis, established and headed by the \r\nSecretary-General. Development and implementation \r\nof a comprehensive plan for food security, in \r\ncooperation with relevant United Nations agencies and \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, would constitute an \r\nimportant step for overcoming the food crisis. \r\n The Government of the Republic of Moldova is \r\nundertaking concrete action with a view to reducing \r\nthe impact of the food crisis on the situation in the \r\ncountry. At present, a national agriculture and food \r\nsecurity programme is being developed. We consider \r\nthat the high-level meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals held on 25 September and the \r\norganization of annual meetings on monitoring the \r\nengagement and implementation of those goals \r\nconstitute new and important opportunities for \r\nimplementing the achievement of all internationally \r\naccepted development objectives. Their implementation \r\nis still possible in the majority of countries if \r\nconsolidated actions directed towards concrete results \r\nare established and continuously sustained and \r\ndeveloped until the year 2015.  \r\n The progress achieved with the support of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU) in the implementation of the \r\nMoldova-EU Action Plan and in conforming the \r\nnational standards to the European standards has \r\nopened new opportunities for the advancement of \r\nMoldovan-European relations. We highly appreciate \r\nthe constructive cooperation with the EU in that \r\nprocess and continue to rely on the assistance of its \r\nmember States in ensuring development and the \r\ngradual integration of our country into the European \r\nUnion. \r\n At the same time, we rely on the support and the \r\nopportunities offered by the United Nations and \r\nMember States with a view to promoting the political, \r\nsocial and economic policies of the country and its \r\nEuropean integration aspirations and to ensuring \r\nsettlement of the Transdniestrian conflict, withdrawal \r\nof foreign military troops and accomplishment of the \r\ndevelopment priorities of the country. \r\n I would like to reiterate the attachment of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova to the ideals of the United \r\nNations and its commitment to continuously cooperate \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 8 \r\n \r\nwith Member States towards achieving the important \r\nobjectives of the Organization. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Rita Kieber-Beck, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Liechtenstein. \r\n Mrs. Kieber-Beck (Liechtenstein): Since we \r\ngathered here a year ago, the world has experienced \r\nmany serious challenges. Natural disasters, climate \r\nchange, violent conflicts, terrorism, human rights \r\nviolations, rising food and energy prices and financial \r\nturmoil have affected the lives of people worldwide. \r\nDealing with crisis after crisis is a daunting task. \r\nWithout the United Nations, it would in many respects \r\nbe a hopeless one. \r\n Indeed, it is the United Nations that gives hope to \r\npeople around the world and it is the United Nations \r\nthat gives political leaders a unique tool to solve \r\nproblems and to settle conflicts. It was created more \r\nthan sixty years ago, under the still-fresh impression of \r\nthe horrors of the Second World War and with a strong \r\nfocus on matters of peace and security. Today, the \r\nworld is a different place, and yet we must keep \r\nturning to the United Nations to solve our problems \r\ntogether and to protect those most in need and danger.  \r\n We applaud the Secretary-General and the \r\ndedicated United Nations personnel for their hard \r\nwork. Nevertheless, the Organization is sometimes \r\nmired in bureaucracy, inefficiency and political \r\ninfighting. But the blame falls mainly on us, the \r\nMember States. It is our responsibility to adapt the \r\nUnited Nations to today’s challenges and to make it the \r\nbest possible organization to that end. We must equip \r\nthe Organization with the resources it needs and make \r\nthe necessary adjustments in its structure. \r\n In recent years, the regular budget of the \r\nOrganization has grown in a completely lopsided way. \r\nCore activities, such as conflict prevention, the \r\npromotion of human rights and the rule of law, \r\nhumanitarian assistance and support for economic and \r\nsocial development, are subject to an artificial policy \r\nof zero budget growth and must be financed largely \r\nthrough voluntary contributions. At the same time, \r\nStates have come to routinely accept massive increases \r\nin peacekeeping bills. It is high time that we shift our \r\nfocus from fighting fires to preventing their outbreak. \r\nWe therefore fully support the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to enhance the conflict prevention and \r\nmediation capacities of the Secretariat. \r\n The session just concluded brought about a \r\nsobering realization that some of the reform processes \r\ninitiated at the 2005 World Summit have effectively \r\ncome to a halt. Others have yet to be the subject of \r\nextremely difficult negotiations. We believe that quick \r\nprogress is necessary on a number of management \r\nreform issues, from human resource management to \r\naccountability and internal justice. We will also \r\ncontinue our work to achieve a more legitimate and \r\nmore effective Security Council. To that end, we will \r\nstep up our efforts to enhance the involvement and \r\naccess of those who are not members of the Council.  \r\n Liechtenstein is a strong believer in \r\nmultilateralism and in a rule-based international \r\nsystem. Our national sovereignty is grounded in \r\ninternational law and its observance, and we are \r\ntherefore strongly committed to the rule of law. Those \r\nprinciples were chief among our motivations for \r\njoining the United Nations 18 years ago, and they have \r\nbeen high among our priorities as a Member ever since.  \r\n The rule of law has gained much prominence in \r\nthe work of the United Nations over the past few years, \r\nbut it has yet to take the central place that is its due. \r\nThe most precious asset of this Organization remains \r\nthe legitimacy that it lends to decisions of the \r\ninternational community. In fact, the United Nations \r\nsymbolizes the rule of law in international relations. \r\nWe must preserve that strength and therefore also \r\npromote the rule of law within United Nations organs, \r\nincluding the Security Council, and their decision-\r\nmaking.  \r\n Together with other countries, we have expressed \r\nlong-standing concerns about the current practice of \r\nthe Security Council regarding sanctions listing and \r\ndelisting, in particular in the area of counter-terrorism. \r\nThere should be no doubt that we fully support the \r\nsanctions regimes, which constitute powerful tools for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nbut we also believe that the procedures applied must be \r\nin accordance with basic international standards of due \r\nprocess. Recent court decisions indicate that our \r\nreservations are well founded, and we hope that our \r\nproposals will contribute to the improvement of the \r\nsystem. We must avoid the impression that decisions of \r\nthe Security Council might be in violation of human \r\nrights standards. \r\n All of our countries, and the Security Council in \r\nparticular, are also called to task in the fight against \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n9 08-53135 \r\n \r\nimpunity. Since the 1990s, the Council has adopted a \r\nnumber of landmark decisions to enforce international \r\ncriminal law, including the decision to establish \r\ninternational and mixed tribunals. The Council also has \r\nan important role to play in connection with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, which deals with the \r\nmost serious crimes under international law. The \r\nCouncil did so in adopting resolution 1593 (2005), and \r\nit is essential that it continue to exercise responsibly its \r\npowers under the Rome Statute.  \r\n Mr. Stratan (Republic of Moldova), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n The International Criminal Court is the most \r\nimportant achievement in decades in the area of \r\ninternational law. Now we must make it work in \r\npractice and give it the necessary political support. The \r\nsuccess of the Court will be the yardstick in the fight \r\nagainst impunity. If we want to win that fight, we must \r\nshow resolve by supporting the Court. \r\n Years ago, the General Assembly adopted the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide, and the International Criminal \r\nCourt was given jurisdiction over that crime 50 years \r\nlater. The Convention was born of the desire to prevent \r\nthe recurrence of genocide, yet it failed to achieve that \r\npurpose on several occasions following its adoption. \r\nThe rallying cry “Never Again!” can be used only so \r\noften before it loses credibility. In that spirit, all of us \r\nagreed to the concept of the responsibility to protect \r\nwhen we met at the summit level three years ago. For \r\nus and for many others, that was one of the most \r\nsignificant gains achieved in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome, which was otherwise a mixed bag. Still, we \r\nare struggling with the challenge to make the concept \r\nwidely understood and to apply it in practice.  \r\n The responsibility to protect is a narrow concept \r\nthat is limited to clearly defined cases of genocide, war \r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. \r\nIt is based on the sovereign responsibility of States to \r\nprotect their own populations as well as the United \r\nNations Charter. We must maintain that conceptual \r\nclarity and provide for consistent implementation of \r\nthe Summit decision. \r\n In spite of the lofty aspirations expressed at the \r\n2005 World Summit, we are still far from taking a \r\ncommon approach to the development agenda, and the \r\nchallenges are growing rapidly. Climate change, the \r\nfood crisis, the energy crisis and the faltering \r\ninternational financial system are just a few examples. \r\nAll those challenges hit particularly hard those who \r\nalready live in poverty, and they also threaten to \r\nundermine the effectiveness of our development \r\ncooperation. We therefore need a consensus on \r\nfinancing for development that builds on the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. Such an agreement will require significant \r\nsacrifices and compromises on all sides, and it is sorely \r\nneeded to strengthen the development pillar of \r\nmultilateral cooperation. \r\n Let me say in conclusion that we have always \r\nstood and fought for a strong General Assembly. By \r\nthat, we do not mean an Assembly that develops an \r\nantagonistic relationship with other organs of the \r\nUnited Nations. We want an Assembly that is a forum \r\nfor meaningful and focused discussions on topics of \r\nhigh relevance, followed by clear decisions and their \r\nimplementation. We hope that this session will allow us \r\nto take a step in that direction. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. George Yeo, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Singapore. \r\n Mr. Yeo (Singapore): The collapse of the recent \r\nDoha talks is deeply troubling. The Doha Development \r\nRound was the first round of talks to be launched after \r\nthe end of the cold war. \r\n Two years after the failed start at Seattle, it was \r\nlaunched again two months after 11 September 2001, \r\nwhen member countries of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) felt a strong sense of common \r\ncause. Since then, however, progress has been \r\npainfully difficult. I remember WTO Director-General \r\nPascal Lamy telling me that not enough countries felt a \r\nsense of responsibility for the global trading system. \r\nThe recent setback in Geneva means that it will be \r\nsome time before the Doha Development Round can be \r\nconcluded. \r\n During the Cold War, the United States and the \r\nEuropean Union effectively led the global trading \r\nsystem of the non-communist world. In 1994, the \r\nUruguay Round was finally concluded after United \r\nStates and European negotiators struck a bargain at \r\nBlair House, much to the unhappiness of many \r\ncountries that felt excluded but went along nonetheless. \r\nFor the Doha Development Agenda, however, a \r\nnumber of developing country members were \r\ndetermined that this should not happen again.  \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 10 \r\n \r\n Brazil played a leading role in forming the Group \r\nof Twenty (G-20) coalition of countries, including \r\nIndia and China. At the Cancún talks in September \r\n2003, the G-20 became a grouping whose position \r\ncould not be ignored, altering the traditional dynamics \r\nof multilateral trade negotiations. When the talks failed \r\nin July, it was apparently over the issues of agricultural \r\nsafeguards for China and India, but even if a \r\ncompromise over safeguards had been possible, United \r\nStates cotton subsidies, which were next on the agenda, \r\nwould still have been a major sticking point. \r\n The failure of the Geneva talks comes at a time \r\nwhen the global economy is rapidly slowing down. \r\nMany of us worry that the downturn will be severe \r\nbecause of the collapse of huge asset bubbles inflated \r\nover many years by loose monetary policies. \r\nProtectionist pressures will now build up in many \r\ncountries. A rise in trade protectionism could reduce \r\nglobal welfare by many billions of dollars. Our \r\ncollective efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have become much \r\nharder. \r\n Who takes responsibility for the global trading \r\nsystem? Who takes responsibility for the global \r\nsystem? While on paper the 153 WTO members make \r\ndecisions by consensus, the reality is that a small group \r\nof countries has to take the lead to keep the multilateral \r\ntrading system moving in the right direction. On no \r\nmajor issue confronting the human family can \r\ndecisions be taken without the major countries taking \r\nthe lead. The challenge of climate change, for example, \r\ncannot be tackled without the major emitters coming to \r\nsome broad agreement on the way forward. If the Doha \r\nRound, despite being a positive-sum game, is so \r\ndifficult to conclude, it is hard to be optimistic that a \r\nUnited Nations agreement on climate change can be \r\nnegotiated quickly without the exercise of strong \r\nleadership by the United States, Europe, Russia, China, \r\nIndia, Japan and Brazil. If they could not or would not \r\nexercise such leadership on global trade, can we expect \r\nthem to do so on climate change? \r\n The emerging multipolar reality of the twenty-\r\nfirst century is a fact that we have to face squarely. \r\nInternational institutions like the United Nations can \r\nonly function well when we accept that reality and \r\nwork with it. As a small country, Singapore accepts \r\nthat while all countries, big or small, have a single vote \r\neach, we do not all carry the same weight. Small \r\ncountries need the United Nations and other \r\ninternational institutions to protect our interests, and \r\nwe therefore have every interest in making sure that \r\nthose institutions are effective. They can work well \r\nonly if the world’s multipolar reality is taken into \r\naccount. The Forum of Small States, which is an \r\ninformal grouping of more than half the United Nations \r\nmembership, takes a realistic view of global politics \r\nbecause that is the only way to secure our own \r\ninterests. \r\n Recent developments in the Balkans and \r\nCaucasus do not bode well for the future. After the \r\ncrimes committed against the Kosovar people in the \r\n1990s, many countries expressed sympathy and \r\nsupported some form of autonomy for them. However, \r\nKosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence in \r\nFebruary was greeted with a certain discomfort \r\nbecause of the precedent it set for other parts of the \r\nworld. I remember Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) foreign ministers discussing Kosovo \r\nat our retreat in Singapore in February. While we \r\nsupported autonomy for the Kosovar people, we felt it \r\npremature to recognize Kosovo’s independence at that \r\npoint in time. There was strong preference for the issue \r\nto be resolved by the United Nations. \r\n Russia’s recent recognition of South Ossetia and \r\nAbkhazia as independent States is also unsettling. \r\nSome analysts see it as Russia’s response to western \r\nsupport for Kosovo’s independence. While the issue of \r\nKosovo and the disputes in South Ossetia and \r\nAbkhazia are different and should not be directly \r\nlinked, we do have a common concern, which is the \r\nrole of the United Nations in conferring legitimacy on \r\nnew States. If this century is to be peaceful, it is crucial \r\nthat all countries, big and small, abjure violence and \r\nadhere to the Charter of the United Nations and to the \r\ninternational rule of law. \r\n The relaxation of tensions across the Taiwan \r\nStraits in the past few months serves as a positive \r\nexample of how intractable problems from the past can \r\nbe creatively transcended with wisdom, goodwill and \r\npatience. Sometimes impatience is its own worst \r\nenemy. After 90 years, the collapse of the Ottoman \r\nEmpire has left some problems still unresolved in parts \r\nof its former domain. We cannot expect all the issues \r\nthrown up by the end of the cold war and the break-up \r\nof the Soviet Union to be quickly overcome. What we \r\nknow is that, without the United Nations setting \r\nacceptable norms of behaviour, there will be many \r\nmore problems in the world and some of the problems \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n11 08-53135 \r\n \r\nwe now face will become far worse. Universally agreed \r\nhuman rights are important precisely because they \r\nunderpin those norms of good behaviour. \r\n However, the realpolitik of big Power rivalry \r\ncannot simply be wished away; indeed, it has been part \r\nof the human condition for most of our history. \r\nHowever, we can confine that rivalry and, by a \r\ncombination of pressures, prevent any Power from \r\npushing its claim excessively. International institutions \r\nlike the United Nations play a civilizing role in such \r\nefforts. International institutions cannot stop big Power \r\nrivalry, but they can channel it and ensure that the \r\ncommon interests of the human family are not \r\ncompletely disregarded. \r\n For that reason, the smaller countries have a \r\nstrong vested interest in seeing international \r\ninstitutions strengthened. The reform of the United \r\nNations to take into account the changes in the world \r\nsince the end of the Second World War is an absolute \r\nnecessity; so, too, is reform of the other Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. Either we reform them to forestall crises or \r\nwe wait for crises to force change upon us. For \r\nexample, if the present global economic downturn is \r\nthe once-in-a-century event Alan Greenspan talked \r\nabout, then bringing China and India into the Group of \r\nEight and making the International Monetary Fund and \r\nWorld Bank more representative of the global economy \r\ntoday become matters of urgency. \r\n We can also make international institutions more \r\neffective by partnership with regional institutions. \r\nEvery region has its own distinctive characteristics \r\nwhich must be taken into account. \r\n When Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar in May, there \r\nwas for many precious days a stand-off between the \r\nMyanmar Government and the international community \r\nover the provision of assistance. Western warships \r\nbearing relief supplies were viewed with suspicion by a \r\nGovernment that saw not the supplies but a military \r\nthreat. It was absurd that such suspicions got in the \r\nway of soldiers helping cyclone victims in the \r\nIrrawaddy Delta. ASEAN had to step in and build a \r\nbridge of trust between the Myanmar Government and \r\nthe international community. A tripartite organization \r\ninvolving the United Nations, ASEAN and the \r\nMyanmar Government worked effectively day by day \r\nto overcome problems on the ground and ensure that \r\ninternational aid reached the furthest corners of the \r\naffected area. That prevented a second wave of deaths \r\nfrom hunger or disease. ASEAN on its own did not \r\nhave the capabilities to help Myanmar in a major way, \r\nbut ASEAN working together with the United Nations \r\nand other international agencies was able to make a \r\nhuge difference.  \r\n With globalization, there has been a \r\nmushrooming of regional institutions around the world. \r\nSome have come to play useful roles in fostering \r\nregional peace and development. The United Nations \r\nand other international agencies can multiply their \r\neffectiveness by working closely with such regional \r\ninstitutions. \r\n While international and regional institutions can \r\nprovide a more conducive environment, the key to a \r\ncountry’s development is its own good governance. \r\nBecause every country has its own unique history, \r\nthere is no universal model of development applicable \r\nto all countries. Every country must find its own road \r\nto the future. \r\n At the closing of the Olympic Games in Beijing, \r\nthe President of the International Olympic Committee, \r\nJacques Rogge, described China’s hosting of the \r\nGames as truly exceptional. Indeed, from beginning to \r\nend, the organization was superb — from the \r\nspectacular opening ceremony to the hospitality \r\nextended to individual delegations. Everyone was \r\nimpressed, and rightly so. That was a Chinese dream \r\ncome true, and the world doffed its hat to the \r\nachievement of the Chinese people. Thirty years ago, \r\nall that would have been inconceivable, even to the \r\nChinese themselves. What has changed? Good \r\ngovernance and the right policies in place have \r\nunleashed the natural talents of over a billion people.  \r\n India, with a different history and political \r\nsystem, is also making remarkable progress. Here \r\nagain, the right policies, introduced less than 20 years \r\nago, have made a profound difference. Indeed, across \r\nall of Asia, from the Bering Straits to the Gulf, an \r\nancient continent, encompassing more than half the \r\nworld’s population, is stirring again. Although highly \r\ndiverse, the countries of Asia are being reconnected by \r\na new East-West trade in a new age of globalization. To \r\nbe sure, not all are doing well. Among those that are, \r\nand they are many, a recent report by the Commission \r\non Growth and Development, chaired by Nobel \r\nlaureate Michael Spence, identified effective \r\ngovernment as a critical factor. In a surprising \r\ndeparture from Western conventional wisdom, the \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 12 \r\n \r\nreport did not see democracy as either a necessary or a \r\nsufficient condition, at least not in the initial phase of \r\neconomic take-off. \r\n That is an important insight which can help the \r\nwork of international and regional institutions in \r\npromoting national development. If we set as our \r\nobjective the promotion of democracy, the reaction \r\namong many countries will instinctively be negative. \r\nHowever, if we set as our objective the promotion of \r\neffective government, our task will be much easier. Let \r\neach country, after having achieved a certain level of \r\ndevelopment, then evolve the form of democracy best \r\nsuited to its culture and history. In a recent speech, \r\nPresident of the World Bank Robert Zoellick hit it on \r\nthe head when he emphasized that the strategic centre \r\nof gravity is to build legitimacy through good and \r\neffective governance. \r\n However, for development to take place, there \r\nmust be peace. Without continuing peace in Asia, we \r\nwill not be able to realize the promise of this century. \r\nThe thoughtful manner in which the United States is \r\nmanaging its strategic relationship with a rising China \r\nand India is of decisive importance. It is rare in history \r\nfor new Powers to emerge without conflict. China and \r\nIndia are becoming responsible stakeholders in the \r\nglobal system. That many of the sons and daughters of \r\nChinese and Indian leaders choose to study in \r\nAmerican universities gives us reason to be cautiously \r\noptimistic about the future of Asia. \r\n We cannot stop rivalry among the big Powers, but \r\nwe can limit the harm that rivalry does to smaller \r\ncountries. In fact, smaller countries can turn the \r\nemerging multipolarity to advantage if we combine our \r\nstrengths in regional and international institutions. \r\nAmong those, the most important is, of course, the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n We still need global leadership, but it has to be by \r\na new concert of big Powers going beyond the United \r\nStates, Europe and Japan. It has to be a new kind of \r\nleadership exercised in a transparent manner through \r\nboth hard and soft power, and preferably through \r\nregional and international institutions. Writing about \r\nthe Beijing Olympics in The Wall Street Journal on \r\n26 August, Tony Blair said: “The truth is that nothing \r\nin the twenty-first century will work well without \r\nChina’s full engagement”. The same can be said of \r\nRussia, India and Brazil. While the United States will \r\nlong remain dominant, a more inclusive global \r\narrangement will make this a better and safer world for \r\nall of us. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Abubakr Al-Qirbi, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Yemen. \r\n Mr. Al-Qirbi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): I should \r\nlike to start by congratulating Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann \r\non being elected to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I am certain that he \r\nwill steer the work of this session wisely and \r\nsuccessfully, and we wish him every success in his \r\nwork. I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, and thank him for his constructive \r\nefforts and the results that he achieved at the sixty-\r\nsecond session. On the occasion of the feast of \r\nRamadan, I wish to extend my warmest greetings to the \r\nIslamic community and to all States of the world. May \r\nthat feast bring prosperity, peace and security to all. \r\n Without doubt, representatives closely monitored \r\nthe terrorist acts perpetrated on the United States \r\nembassy, which were combated by our courageous \r\nYemeni security forces. While we join the international \r\ncommunity and the Security Council in condemning \r\nthat terrorist act, we welcome the readiness of many \r\ncountries to work on a daily basis to counter terrorism. \r\nWe hope that such positive attitudes will translate into \r\ngenuine support that will enhance human development \r\nprojects and enable Yemen to overcome poverty by \r\nalso strengthening the Yemeni security forces, so that \r\nthey can play an effective role alongside the \r\ninternational community in countering terrorism. We \r\nalso need increased cooperation and coordination \r\namong security and intelligence services at the \r\ninternational level so as to close all the gaps that have \r\nenabled terrorists to continue their destructive \r\nactivities, which are alien to the values of religion and \r\nhuman morals.  \r\n Because of the exorbitant costs that we have had \r\nto bear in the field of security, Yemen has paid a heavy \r\ntoll in terms of lives and material damage in the anti-\r\nterrorist activities that we undertake. Terrorist activities \r\ncarried out by Al-Qaida and Islamic jihad elements, as \r\nwell as by rebel movements, have caused tremendous \r\neconomic losses of over $2 billion to the Yemeni \r\nGovernment and impeded the implementation of \r\ndevelopment projects and Government measures to \r\nreduce poverty. We therefore call on donor States, \r\ninternational organizations and Yemen’s partners in \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n13 08-53135 \r\n \r\ncounter-terrorism to assist Yemen generously and to \r\nhelp it carry out the development projects and poverty-\r\nreduction programmes that are key components in \r\ncountering terrorism, especially since terrorists exploit \r\npoverty, need and ignorance to polarize people and \r\nrecruit individuals. \r\n In the war on terrorism, in its various forms, \r\nmany people have falsely found a pretext to mobilize \r\nagainst the Muslim religion, since Islam is the religion \r\nof dialogue, tolerance and moderation. In that \r\nconnection, the Republic of Yemen fully supports the \r\ninitiative of His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia with \r\nregard to dialogue among religions — an initiative that \r\nattracted great attention at the Madrid conference. \r\nThere is also a crucial need to fight terrorism around \r\nthe world by reviewing counter-terrorism mechanisms \r\nso that the war on terror will not harm the lives of \r\ninnocent citizens and cause human rights violations. \r\n The Republic of Yemen, which is one of the least \r\ndeveloped countries, continues to progress towards \r\ndemocratization through political plurality and freedom \r\nof expression, and is striving to promote the role of \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society and \r\nthe principle of the peaceful sharing of power. Yemen \r\nis moving from a local administration system to \r\none of local governance that grants broad prerogatives \r\nin the area of decentralization and power-sharing. \r\nParliamentary elections will take place in 2009 with \r\nthe participation of various political parties. The \r\nRepublic of Yemen, in that regard, intends to take all \r\nmeasures to safeguard the integrity of those elections, \r\ncomplying with international standards and welcoming \r\nthe participation of international observers.  \r\n This session of the General Assembly is taking \r\nplace in difficult international circumstances, with a \r\nnew cold war threatening to return to the world and to \r\nundermine global peace and stability. We believe that \r\nthis important international forum should be an \r\ninstrument for resolving all issues and challenges and \r\ntheir implications for international relations. We trust \r\nthat, through dialogue, non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of countries and respect for the interests of all, \r\nwe will be able to prevent a return to the age of \r\nalliances, because the world now has a crucial need for \r\ninternational cooperation in a spirit of pluralism and \r\npartnership instead of further tension and polarization.  \r\n The changes on the international scene are \r\nmultiple. The most important facets are related to the \r\ninternational economic situation, which has confronted \r\nus with a number of unprecedented challenges. Among \r\nthose challenges is the severe shortage of foodstuffs, \r\nthe increase in the cost of food internationally and the \r\nrise in energy prices. Those acute crises threaten to \r\naffect the economies of poor countries, in particular by \r\nincreasing the number of hungry people around the \r\nworld. They are further compounded by industrial \r\nStates’ growing use of biofuels, which poses a threat to \r\nthe world’s current food reserves. While we agree that \r\nbiofuels do help to reduce damage from global \r\nwarming, that equation might change entirely if we \r\nwere to take into account the potential effect on a large \r\nproportion of the world’s population, who may be \r\nfacing famine. Food must be produced in the interests \r\nof the mass of humanity. \r\n Poor countries are facing a major challenge \r\nbecause of the increase in the prices of food and \r\nenergy. Whenever there are glimmers of hope on the \r\nhorizon for developing countries, they find themselves \r\nfacing new obstacles to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). There can be \r\nno doubt that, in order to address such difficulties, we \r\nneed increased international solidarity and cooperation. \r\nWe call on the major economic Powers and countries \r\nthat produce energy and food to fully shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities vis-à-vis the poorest countries and to \r\nhelp them to achieve development and the MDGs \r\nadopted by this Assembly in 2000. \r\n The difficult humanitarian situation of the \r\nPalestinian people, whose rights continue to be denied \r\nand trampled by Israel, is a source of grave concern for \r\nus. Moreover, Israel’s expansionist policies of building \r\nillegal settlements on Palestinian and Syrian territories \r\nand of the racist separation wall in the West Bank, \r\nwhich have been condemned by the international \r\ncommunity and the International Criminal Court, are \r\ncreating further problems and placing new obstacles in \r\nthe path of the peace process in the Middle East. We \r\ncall on all parties, including the Quartet, to act to build \r\na climate favourable to the restoration of trust among \r\nthe parties concerned in the peace process so as to \r\nattain comprehensive and just peace.  \r\n It is high time to put an end to the procrastination \r\npolicies of Israel. We greatly deplore the fact that \r\nIsraeli occupation forces are committing offences in \r\nthe holy sites in Jerusalem, which are among the most \r\nsacred to Muslims. We warn the occupying Israeli \r\nforces not to persist in such measures because, besides \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 14 \r\n \r\ntheir potential impact on the peace process, they may \r\nalso have uncontrollable and unforeseeable \r\nconsequences. We believe it essential to adopt \r\nresolutions without delay to provide for the protection \r\nof the holy places and religious symbols, whatever they \r\nmay be, while firmly condemning any prejudice or \r\ndamage that may be done to them.  \r\n We warmly welcome the positive developments \r\nin Iraq. We also welcome the improved security \r\nsituation and hope to see greater political stability in \r\nthat fraternal country. From this rostrum, we welcome \r\nmeasures taken by the Iraqi Government to establish a \r\ntimetable to end the presence of coalition forces on \r\nIraqi territory as a major step towards its recovery of \r\nsecurity, peace and stability and in order to protect its \r\nArab identity and strengthen its national unity and role \r\nin the region.  \r\n We are also closely monitoring with great \r\nsatisfaction the positive results achieved in Lebanon \r\nand the work being carried out by the Arab Group \r\nunder the auspices of sisterly Qatar. We hope that the \r\nagreement between the various Lebanese parties and \r\nbetween the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon will \r\nalso be successful. Security and stability must be \r\nstrengthened in that region, and we hope that those \r\nagreements will play an important role in enhancing \r\nprosperity and peace for our neighbours in Iraq and \r\nLebanon. \r\n The Republic of Yemen is deeply concerned by \r\nattempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the \r\nSudan, and we reaffirm the importance of respecting \r\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence \r\nof that country. We call on the international community \r\nto fully assume its responsibilities in Darfur, and we \r\nencourage dialogue between the Sudanese Government \r\nand the various factions, considering any party that \r\nrejects dialogue and reconciliation and that resorts to \r\nviolence to be a terrorist entity imperilling peace and \r\nstability. We also welcome the African and Arab efforts \r\nto resolve the Darfur problem and to nullify the \r\nnegative impact of the decision of the Prosecutor of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We once again express \r\nour repudiation of politicized decisions by international \r\njudicial and humanitarian organizations that infringe \r\non the sovereignty of States and interfere in their \r\ninternal affairs. \r\n Instability in Somalia has negatively affected \r\ncountries of the region and is threatening the safety and \r\nsecurity of navigation in international waters, as a \r\nresult of the worsening phenomenon of piracy.  \r\n As members are aware, the number of refugees is \r\nconstantly rising. Those refugees, who number \r\napproximately 500,000, have come to Yemen from the \r\nHorn of Africa. Millions in Somalia and in the Horn of \r\nAfrica are threatened by famine, which could increase \r\nthe number of refugees and thus the burden borne by \r\nthe Government of Yemen. Therefore, we call for \r\ngreater international support to help Yemen cope with \r\nthe waves of refugees and to help Yemeni coast guard \r\nforces to combat piracy. \r\n The situation in Somalia poses a challenge to the \r\ninternational community and requires serious efforts to \r\nachieve peace and security for the Somali people in \r\norder to enhance security and stability in the Horn of \r\nAfrica. In that connection, we welcome Ethiopia’s \r\nreadiness to withdraw its forces from Somalia and \r\nreaffirm the need to deploy international forces to \r\nrestore stability there. We also call on all Somali \r\nparties to seek reconciliation and end their disputes, \r\nbearing in mind the interests of the Somali people, and \r\nwe urge all external actors to refrain from interfering in \r\nSomalia’s internal affairs. \r\n My delegation stresses the need to continue the \r\nprocess of United Nations reform. We reaffirm our \r\nresolve to join all other countries of the world in \r\ncontributing effectively to the attainment of that \r\nobjective. We believe that such reform is necessary and \r\nimportant and that all must join in the efforts to \r\nachieve it. Of particular importance is reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, which should not be limited to \r\nexpanding its membership, but should ultimately result \r\nin more rational use of the right of veto so that it can \r\nno longer be used to block resolutions approved by the \r\nvast majority of the membership.  \r\n In closing, on behalf of Yemen, I wish to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his unstinting support, efforts \r\nand guidance at the head of the Organization. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Salah Bashir, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. \r\n Mr. Bashir (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I wish to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every \r\nsuccess in leading us as we work to strengthen the role \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n15 08-53135 \r\n \r\nof the United Nations in promoting international \r\nrelations in the spirit of the Charter, which is the most \r\nimportant international pillar of the rule of law. I also \r\nthank his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, for his good efforts to ensure the success of the \r\nprevious session. In addition, I wish to commend the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his efforts to \r\nreform the Organization so that it can play a more \r\neffective role in addressing emerging global \r\nchallenges. \r\n In his introductory statement on 16 September \r\n2008 (see A/63/PV.1), the day he assumed the \r\npresidency of the Assembly, Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann \r\nreferred to many important political and humanitarian \r\nissues. For example, he mentioned the need to improve \r\nUnited Nations organs to enable them to adapt to the \r\nmajor changes that have occurred in the international \r\nsphere in the 63 years since the Organization was \r\nestablished following the Second World War. He also \r\nstated that the Organization should be improved so that \r\nit can better address the accelerated changes that have \r\ntaken place since the end of the cold war and the era of \r\npolarization — changes whose effects have begun to be \r\nfelt over the past two decades.  \r\n In that context, Jordan believes it is essential to \r\nrevitalize the role of the General Assembly as \r\nenvisaged in the Charter, so that the international \r\ndecision-making process can be further democratized. \r\nJordan supports the trend towards rebalancing the \r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n A week ago, at the 5th meeting, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral introduced his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/63/1), in which he assessed the world \r\nsituation. In the report, he made clear that we face \r\nchallenges that encompass all human activities, \r\ntranscending individual countries and regions. Hence, \r\nwe must examine the dangers posed by those \r\nchallenges — many of which have their roots in \r\nideology and similar motivations — in order to find \r\nappropriate solutions and move effectively forward \r\ntogether. Among the challenges cited by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral are the lack of progress in international trade \r\nnegotiations, high energy costs and basic food prices \r\nand climate change. While we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s assessment, we should like to add that \r\nadditional challenges are posed by continued military \r\noccupation, denial of the rights of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination and freedom of expression, the growing \r\ncrisis of intercultural conflict and the scourge of \r\ninternational terrorism and extremism. \r\n The most important role being played by the \r\nUnited Nations in the Middle East region has been and \r\nremains that of the custodian of international law. On \r\nthe one hand, it governs international relations and is \r\nthe standard by which we measure progress made in \r\nthe international community; on the other, it embodies \r\na strong, objective approach to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n Because of our strong belief in the role of the \r\nUnited Nations, we view the Organization as the basic \r\nframework for finding a solution to the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict, putting an end to the occupation of Arab lands \r\nand redressing the injustices suffered by the Palestinian \r\npeople. For decades, the Arab States have taken many \r\ninitiatives and made many proposals, based on \r\ninternational legitimacy, to achieve a peaceful solution \r\nto the conflict so that the Palestinians can be liberated \r\nfrom Israeli occupation and can live in dignity in their \r\nown homeland.  \r\n To that end, in 2002 the Arab States jointly \r\nsubmitted a comprehensive Arab Peace Initiative. It \r\nsought to end the 60-year-old conflict as well as \r\nIsrael’s occupation of Arab lands — Palestinian, Syrian \r\nand Lebanese territories — since 1967, in exchange for \r\na comprehensive peace that would include mutual \r\nrecognition between Israel and the Arab States, \r\nincluding the State of Palestine, and the establishment \r\nof normal relations between them. The Arab Peace \r\nInitiative was and continues to be an open and clear \r\ninvitation to Israel to become part of our region \r\nwithout conditions or restrictions. \r\n While the Initiative was widely welcomed by the \r\nnations of the world and was adopted by 57 States \r\nmembers of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference, Israel ignored it and began to build the \r\nwall of separation, in defiance of the Advisory Opinion \r\nof the International Court of Justice, and intensified its \r\nsettlement activities, which threaten its chances to \r\nmake peace with the Palestinian people and the Arabs. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n The efforts of the Quartet are essential to move \r\nthe political process forward and to find a solution that, \r\nin accordance with international legitimacy, ends the \r\nIsraeli occupation, dismantles the settlements, fulfils \r\nthe aspirations of the Palestinian people to establish \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 16 \r\n \r\ntheir own State in their homeland, including East \r\nJerusalem, and enables the refugees to return to their \r\nhomes and villages, from which they were expelled in \r\n1948. \r\n From this rostrum, Jordan affirms that it supports \r\nthe negotiations that resumed at Annapolis and values \r\nthe strategic option of peace reaffirmed in the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative and the two-State solution. At the same \r\ntime, we believe that the challenges faced by the \r\nnegotiations as we approach the end of the year require \r\nthe international community to demand that the parties \r\nto the negotiations meet their commitments and that \r\nthe Quartet make further efforts to achieve the desired \r\nresults regarding final status negotiations and the \r\nfulfilment of the Road Map obligations. \r\n The final months of 2008 will be a critical period \r\nin the course of those negotiations. Therefore, it is \r\nimperative that Israel have the political will to resolve \r\nthe ongoing conflict, after more than six decades. In \r\naddition, the Palestinian people should be supported on \r\ntheir own land and the Palestinian National Authority \r\nshould be strengthened to help it to continue fulfilling \r\nits obligations, improving the conditions for \r\nPalestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories and \r\nbuilding State institutions. That also requires \r\nPalestinians to bridge their differences against the \r\nbackdrop of the Arab Peace Initiative and to promote \r\nthe position of the Palestinian National Authority both \r\non the international scene and in the context of the \r\nnegotiations. \r\n While all parties strive to reach a final solution to \r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel continues its \r\nillegal practices of seizing Arab land in order to change \r\nthe demographic make-up of the occupied territories \r\nthrough the building of settlements and the separation \r\nwall, and changing the status of Jerusalem, in clear \r\nviolation of international law, the principles of \r\ninternational legitimacy and the provisions of the \r\nFourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of \r\nCivilian Persons in Time of War. Recent speed in \r\nbuilding Israeli settlements threatens to erode all \r\nprogress achieved so far in the peace process.  \r\n We reject all Israeli measures that aim to create a \r\nnew status quo in the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nparticularly in East Jerusalem, including threats to the \r\nIslamic and Arab character of the holy city. We \r\nreaffirm that Israeli violations in the holy city, and \r\nparticularly in the Bab al-Magharibah area, contradict \r\nthe norms of international law, the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention, The Hague Convention of 1954, as well as \r\nthe July 2008 decision of UNESCO’s World Heritage \r\nCommittee. As Jordan has played a historic role in the \r\nsupervision and maintenance of Islamic holy places in \r\nJerusalem, we call upon Israel to comply with its \r\npledges and obligations and to put an end to those \r\nillegal practices.  \r\n Unless there is justice for the Palestinian people, \r\nour region will be subjected to a long era of \r\ndestabilization. But ours will not be the only region \r\naffected by that destabilization, because the feelings of \r\ninjustice, disappointment and anger will increase as a \r\nresult of stagnation in the peace process. This will fuel \r\nextremism in its various forms and manifestations and \r\nwill be used as a pretext by those who would like to \r\ndestabilize the region and the world beyond.  \r\n I would like to congratulate the brotherly people \r\nof Lebanon on having achieved national reconciliation, \r\non the election of a President and the formation of a \r\nGovernment of national unity. I also congratulate them \r\non embarking on an extensive and profound process of \r\nnational dialogue aimed at strengthening Lebanese \r\nState institutions and seeking ways to defend Lebanese \r\nterritory and sovereignty. \r\n Concerning Iraq, we welcome the remarkable \r\nprogress made in that brotherly country and the \r\nimprovement of the situation at all levels. Jordan \r\nrecently reopened and adequately staffed its embassy \r\nin Baghdad. His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan \r\nrecently visited the brotherly country of Iraq; his visit \r\nwas widely welcomed at the Arab and international \r\nlevels. We encourage all channels of political and \r\neconomic communication between Iraq and other Arab \r\ncountries, and we encourage the Iraqi Government to \r\ncontinue its approach to developing channels of \r\nnational reconciliation in order to build upon the \r\nprogress achieved so far in the areas of politics and \r\nsecurity. Such progress encourages Iraqis to return to \r\ntheir country from neighbouring States and the \r\nbuilding of a society based on political diversity and \r\nfree of sectarianism, factionalism and other harms to \r\nsociety. \r\n Making the Middle East a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction is a prerequisite for ensuring the \r\npeace and stability of the region. In 1970, based on our \r\nbelief in and support for the preventive goals of \r\nnuclear non-proliferation, we, joined other countries in \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n17 08-53135 \r\n \r\nthe world and the region, with the exception of Israel, \r\nin acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. We call upon the international \r\ncommunity and influential States to bring pressure to \r\nbear in order to ensure accession by all countries to \r\nthat international Treaty in order to achieve a nuclear \r\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East in accordance \r\nwith international agreements, and to put an end to \r\nnuclear military programmes in the region once and for \r\nall. \r\n Concerning the Iranian nuclear issue, we believe \r\nthat every nation should exercise its right to the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy. But, at the same time, \r\nwe call for a resolution of that issue, based on a \r\npeaceful approach and on negotiations. In that regard, \r\nJordan attaches great importance to promoting security \r\nand stability in the Arabian Gulf area in accordance \r\nwith the principles of international legitimacy, good-\r\nneighbourliness and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States. We welcome any effective \r\ncontribution by Arab States that would maintain \r\nundiminished security and stability in our region. \r\n Jordan and the whole region have suffered from \r\nthe scourge of international terrorism. That has made \r\nus more vigilant, cautious and determined to \r\neffectively combat terrorism with a view to eradicating \r\nit. Jordan upholds international counter-terrorism \r\nconventions and values international cooperation in \r\nthat area. We have also taken the necessary national \r\nmeasures, including legislative measures, to combat \r\nthat scourge effectively and to support international \r\nefforts to combat it.  \r\n Manifestations of extremism in the region are \r\noften based on politicized pretexts that serve the \r\nnarrow interests of certain groups. Such groups \r\nmisrepresent the true Islamic religion and use it as a \r\ncover for their deeds, thereby threatening the forces of \r\nmoderation and projecting an incorrect image of Islam \r\nto the world. In that regard, His Majesty King Abdullah \r\nII, in his Amman message, called upon all Muslim \r\nnations to project the proper image of Islam.  \r\n As we are about to celebrate the first decade of \r\nthe auspicious reign of His Majesty King Abdullah II, \r\nwe are very proud of the great achievements made \r\nduring his reign and look forward to even greater \r\nachievements in the years ahead. During that decade, \r\nJordanian participation in peacekeeping operations \r\nexpanded, reaching a cumulative total of 60,000 men \r\nand women who have served in 20 missions on four \r\ncontinents. That contribution reflects our serious and \r\nunreserved commitment to enhancing international \r\npeace and security. \r\n By the end of 2008, our economy will have \r\ndoubled in size since a decade ago. Per capita income \r\nwill have grown by 65 per cent. Exports and \r\ninvestment will have increased threefold. Jordan has \r\nimplemented ambitious reform plans towards the \r\nliberalization of foreign trade and the enhancement of \r\nthe business environment. We have strengthened the \r\nprogrammes and institutions of good governance and \r\npolitical development, enhanced the role of women and \r\nthe protection of human rights, combated corruption \r\nand made breakthroughs in the areas of health and \r\neducation. The Government is also carrying out \r\nambitious programmes towards political, economic and \r\nsocial reform and development in accordance with the \r\nnational agenda, with a view to achieving a better \r\nfuture for the country. This is of particular importance \r\nbecause young people represent 60 per cent of our \r\npopulation. \r\n In spite of all those efforts, programmes and \r\nsuccesses, successive crises in our region continue to \r\npresent great challenges to our development process. \r\nThose challenges are exacerbated by the severe current \r\neconomic crises and increased prices of food and fuel, \r\nleading to increased inflation of about 15 per cent. \r\nHere I would like to reaffirm that international efforts \r\nto address economic challenges should take into \r\naccount the voices of countries such as Jordan so that \r\nall may benefit from international efforts to address the \r\nchallenges of the international economic, food and \r\nenergy crises, in particular through programmes and \r\nmechanisms that take into consideration the specific \r\nsituations of those States. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nyan Win, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Union of Myanmar. \r\n Mr. Win (Myanmar): We live in an era when the \r\nworld is becoming increasingly interdependent. \r\nNothing illustrates this interdependency more than the \r\nAsian financial crisis of a decade ago and the current \r\nfinancial crisis gripping the world’s largest economy. \r\nThe problems may have local roots, but, given the \r\nseverity of the situation, their effects will transcend \r\nborders. The world economy, and by extension the \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 18 \r\n \r\nstability of nations, depends on the stability of the \r\nfinancial markets. \r\n In recent months, the world has also been \r\nchallenged by the soaring prices of fuel and food, \r\nparticularly such staples as rice. Those daunting \r\nchallenges add an extra burden to developing \r\ncountries. The answer to those problems lies not in \r\nmultiplying the number of world summits and \r\nconferences but in taking concrete actions towards \r\nimplementing the commitments made. \r\n My own country has the potential to contribute to \r\nenergy and food security in our region. We are willing \r\nto do our part. We are making concerted efforts to \r\nproduce more crude oil and natural gas to meet the \r\nneeds of the domestic market as well as for export. We \r\nalso have huge potential to produce hydroelectric \r\npower. Moreover, as the agriculture sector is the \r\nmainstay of Myanmar’s economy, we are focusing on \r\nexpanding the cultivation of paddy, beans and pulses. \r\nWe have also introduced new industrial crops, such as \r\njatropha, for use in the production of biofuels. \r\n Developing countries like my own need to have a \r\nlevel playing field in order to promote the economic \r\nprosperity and social progress of our people. Subsidies \r\nand protectionist policies distort markets and do great \r\nharm to developing countries. Political and social \r\nprogress can be achieved only through development, \r\nnever through coercive economic measures. Such \r\nmeasures only serve to worsen the plight of the people, \r\nparticularly the most vulnerable among them, women \r\nand children. \r\n Unilateral sanctions have been imposed on my \r\ncountry. Those sanctions are unwarranted. Unilateral \r\nsanctions are also against international law. They are \r\nnot only unfair but immoral. They are counter-\r\nproductive and deprive countries of their right to \r\ndevelopment and do not function as a solution to solve \r\nthe problem. \r\n Myanmar has abundant land and natural \r\nresources with which to make a meaningful \r\ncontribution to the energy and food security of our \r\ncountry and beyond. But in order for us to fulfil our \r\npotential we need unfettered access to markets. We \r\nneed modern technology; we need investment. The \r\nsooner the unjust sanctions are revoked and the barriers \r\nremoved, the sooner the country will be in a position to \r\nbecome the rice bowl of the region and a reliable \r\nsource of energy. \r\n That brings me to the matter of making the \r\nUnited Nations an Organization better suited to meet \r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. Only a more \r\ndemocratic Organization will be able to respond to the \r\nneeds of Member States and serve the interests of the \r\ninternational community as a whole. Reform of the \r\nOrganization, particularly reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, has been on our agenda for some time. \r\nHowever, progress has been extremely slow. The role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly as the principal \r\ndeliberative and representative organ must be \r\nenhanced, including in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n Reform of the Security Council has eluded us for \r\nover a decade. Myanmar believes that the membership \r\nof the Security Council should reflect current reality. \r\nWe believe in an increase in the membership of the \r\nCouncil in both the permanent and the elected \r\ncategories. Reform should not be confined to an \r\nincrease in membership but must also include \r\nimprovement in the Council’s working methods. Above \r\nall, it should result in a Security Council that is \r\ntransparent, credible and democratic. \r\n Here, I would like to stress that attempts to \r\ninitiate formal or informal discussions in the Security \r\nCouncil on situations that do not constitute a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security are contrary to the \r\nletter and the spirit of the Charter. This is a view that \r\nMyanmar shares with the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nwhich constitutes a clear majority of the membership \r\nof our Organization. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nadopted in 2000 are imperatives that the international \r\ncommunity has set for itself. We have now passed the \r\nmidpoint, but progress has been uneven. Much more \r\nremains to be done if the Goals are to be achieved by \r\n2015. While national Governments have the primary \r\nresponsibility to ensure progress, the international \r\ncommunity must help by creating an environment that \r\nwill enable developing countries to turn faltering steps \r\ntowards development into firm strides. Fulfilment of \r\nofficial development assistance commitments, \r\nincreased investment flows, improved market access \r\nand resolution of the debt problem are needed to enable \r\nthe developing countries to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n For its part, Myanmar is striving to promote better \r\nliving standards for its people. The implementation of \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n19 08-53135 \r\n \r\nthe MDGs is inextricably linked to the implementation \r\nof our national development plan. The national plan \r\nfocuses on the promotion of equitable and balanced \r\nsocio-economic development of both rural and urban \r\nareas. In recent years, we have made significant \r\nprogress in areas such as poverty alleviation, the \r\npromotion of health and education. \r\n In the health sector, Myanmar has been \r\nimplementing a national plan that accords priority to \r\nthe eradication of major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and tuberculosis. The high-level multisectoral \r\ncommittee on AIDS has been overseeing HIV/AIDS \r\nprevention and care activities in our country since \r\n1989. The activities undertaken by the committee \r\ninclude active surveillance, prevention of mother-to-\r\nchild transmission and community, institution and \r\nhome-based care services. These activities are carried \r\nout by the Government in close cooperation with \r\ninternational organizations such as the World Health \r\nOrganization, UNICEF and the World Food Programme, \r\nand with national and international non-governmental \r\norganizations in order to reach out widely to vulnerable \r\ngroups. \r\n As a result, Myanmar has not only levelled the \r\nrate of HIV/AIDS infection but also reduced it. I would \r\nlike to emphasize that if we are to achieve a more \r\ndynamic and effective global response to HIV/AIDS, \r\nadequate resources must be made available. Moreover, \r\nallocation of resources for HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis must be based on need rather than on \r\npolitical considerations. \r\n With regard to education, we envision a system \r\nfor our people that will generate a learning society \r\ncapable of meeting the challenges of the information \r\nage we live in. Long-term investment in the education \r\nsector is being made with the aim of building human \r\nresource development. The Government has been \r\nexpanding the number of basic, primary, post-primary, \r\nmiddle and high schools throughout the country in \r\norder to provide access to education for all. We \r\nstrongly believe education to be a fundamental \r\nrequirement for the attainment of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It is also a prerequisite for the \r\nachievement of other MDGs. \r\n I am happy to be able to say that, as a result of \r\nour efforts, the literacy rate of those 15 years old and \r\nabove has risen to 94.8 per cent. Likewise, the rate of \r\nenrolment in primary schools has reached 98 per cent. \r\n Myanmar also accords priority to creating job \r\nopportunities in rural areas as part of its poverty \r\nalleviation strategy. In that regard, development \r\nprojects to improve economic, educational and health \r\nconditions in rural areas are being implemented all \r\nover the country. \r\n The Secretary-General’s initiative to convene \r\ntoday’s Ministerial Meeting on Reducing Disaster \r\nRisks in a Changing Climate is indeed timely. We in \r\nMyanmar can relate to the growing concern of the \r\nworld regarding climate change and its adverse effects. \r\nWe felt the full brunt of the devastating consequences \r\nof climate change last May, when a powerful cyclone \r\nslammed into the Ayeyarwaddy delta. Cyclone Nargis \r\nleft unprecedented death and destruction in its wake. \r\nThe pain and sorrow felt by the survivors of the \r\ndevastating storm continue even today.  \r\n There is, however, a silver lining in the dark \r\nclouds. The Myanmar nation was united in its response \r\nto the emergency. The outpouring of generosity was \r\noverwhelming. People from all walks of life, regardless \r\nof their own difficulties, donated, in cash and in kind, \r\nfor the victims. The United Nations, States members of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, donor \r\ncountries, non-governmental organizations and \r\nindividuals from around the world also responded \r\ngenerously. We have been able to demonstrate \r\nwillingness and ability to work in concert with the \r\ninternational community. We have been able to rebuild \r\nbetter and stronger homes, schools and monasteries. \r\nThe paddy fields destroyed by the storm have been \r\nreplanted. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to express \r\nour heartfelt appreciation to our friends from far and \r\nnear who came to our assistance in our time of need. \r\n Myanmar is home to over 100 national races, and \r\nnational unity is of paramount importance. \r\nAccordingly, we have been resolutely pursuing a policy \r\nof national reconciliation. Our endeavours have \r\nresulted in the return to the legal fold of 17 armed \r\ngroups. We have effectively put an end to the decades-\r\nlong insurgency. Peace and stability now prevail in \r\nalmost all parts of the country. \r\n We have also been implementing a seven-step \r\npolitical road map to democracy. The representatives of \r\nformer armed groups, together with the representatives \r\nof political parties, ethnic nationalities and other \r\nrepresentatives, took an active part in the National \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 20 \r\n \r\nConvention process. The National Convention laid \r\ndown the fundamental principles to be enshrined in a \r\nnew constitution. Based on those principles, a new \r\nConstitution was drafted and was put to a nationwide \r\nreferendum last May. The people of Myanmar \r\noverwhelmingly approved the draft constitution. \r\n The fifth step of the road map, general elections, \r\nwill be taken in 2010. Necessary measures are being \r\nundertaken for the elections. All citizens, regardless of \r\npolitical affiliation, will have equal rights to form \r\npolitical parties and to conduct election campaigns. \r\nThe Government will make every effort to ensure that \r\nthe elections are free and fair. The international \r\ncommunity can best assist Myanmar’s democratization \r\nprocess by respecting the will of its people, expressed \r\nin the recent referendum. \r\n The daunting challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury can be addressed only through international \r\ncooperation. We can solve international problems of \r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character \r\nonly by working together. To do this, powerful \r\ncountries should refrain from practicing hegemonic \r\npolicies through either political or economic pressure. \r\n In the global village in which we live, mutual \r\nrespect, understanding and tolerance must be the \r\nvalues that we espouse. Let us work together to give \r\nour global village a peaceful and prosperous future. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Phandu Skalemani, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of the Republic of Botswana. \r\n Mr. Skalemani (Botswana): I am delighted, Sir, \r\nto congratulate you on your assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. Your election to that high office is indeed a \r\nclear reflection of the strong confidence and trust that \r\nthe international community has in you personally, and \r\nalso in your great country, Nicaragua. I am confident \r\nthat under your able guidance we will continue to build \r\non the achievements of the sixty-second session in our \r\nefforts to advance our common global agenda towards \r\na more just, secure and prosperous world. I assure you \r\nof the full support, cooperation and goodwill of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Botswana in the \r\ndischarge of your mandate. \r\n I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \r\nAssembly at its sixth-second session. We sincerely \r\ncommend him for his sterling work and leadership, \r\nwhich enabled us to achieve critical milestones towards \r\nour common goals. \r\n This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. This is an \r\nimportant event on our global human rights agenda. It \r\nis an occasion for Member States to reflect, \r\nindividually and collectively, on how much progress \r\nwe have made in our efforts to build a more just world \r\norder. The Universal Declaration embodies the \r\naspirations of humanity for liberty, freedom and \r\nequality. It is a reflection of the human spirit to strive \r\nfor a more perfect society in which individuals \r\nrecognize the reality that creating the space for the \r\nenjoyment of individual human rights expands the \r\nhorizons for society to realize its full potential. \r\n In pursuance of this noble objective we must \r\ncontinuously strive to improve our governance in order \r\nto ensure that it is responsive to the wishes of the \r\npeople. It should be borne in mind that, in the final \r\nanalysis, it is the people in whom the sovereignty of \r\nany nation is vested. In that respect, it is imperative \r\nthat the will of the people expressed in free and fair \r\nelections be respected by all political leaders. Heads of \r\nState or Government must avoid the temptation to \r\nchange constitutions in an effort to prolong their stay \r\nin power, which often results in instability. \r\n Botswana reaffirms its commitment to the ideals \r\nand purposes of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. We are determined to contribute to the \r\npromotion of respect for human rights at home and \r\nabroad. In doing so we are conscious of the need for \r\ninternational cooperation in the promotion of human \r\nrights. It is for this reason that Botswana is a State \r\nparty to a number of human rights instruments, \r\nincluding the Rome Statute on the establishment of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.  \r\n We fully support the work of that Court. As a \r\ncountry that strongly believes in the rule of law, we are \r\nconvinced that there should be no political interference \r\nin the work of the Court. The International Criminal \r\nCourt was established with the support of African \r\nStates. We felt that it was necessary to address \r\nproblems that confronted our continent. The Court is \r\nmeant to serve a specific purpose and there should be \r\nno exceptions regarding what it can or cannot do. \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n21 08-53135 \r\n \r\n Botswana is pleased that representatives of \r\npolitical parties in Zimbabwe finally signed an \r\nagreement in Harare on 15 September 2008. We \r\nwelcomed that development, as it augurs well for \r\nnational reconciliation, economic reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment in Zimbabwe. The effective \r\nimplementation of the agreement should have a \r\npositive impact not only on developments in Zimbabwe \r\nbut also on Southern Africa and the wider African \r\nregion. This is a good beginning, and we encourage the \r\nparties to do all they can to make the agreement work. \r\nNo party should attempt to obstruct the implementation \r\nof the agreement, as the political crisis that confronted \r\nthat country following the 29 June 2008 presidential \r\nrun-off election can be resolved only through the \r\nimplementation of the agreement. Such a development \r\nwould not be acceptable to Botswana. We call upon the \r\ninternational community to help the process to succeed \r\nby extending their goodwill and support to the \r\nGovernment and the people of Zimbabwe with much-\r\nneeded economic, financial and technical assistance. \r\n We must commend the former President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa, His Excellency Mr. Thabo \r\nMbeki, for his hard work, commitment and \r\ndetermination in helping the Zimbabweans reach \r\nagreement. We also wish to pay tribute to former \r\nPresident Mbeki for his contribution to the attainment \r\nof freedom and democracy not only in South Africa but \r\nalso in the wider African continent. We are grateful to \r\nhim for his visionary leadership and his people-centred \r\ninitiatives, whose primary objective was to build an \r\nAfrican continent that is free, peaceful, democratic and \r\neconomically prosperous. \r\n As the international community, we have the \r\ncollective responsibility to equip and make optimal use \r\nof our multilateral body, the United Nations, to search \r\nfor fair and just solutions to global problems in order \r\nto contribute to the betterment of all humanity. Today, \r\nmore than ever before, the United Nations is required \r\nto respond effectively and swiftly to the complex \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Conflicts, \r\npoverty, disease, natural and man-made disasters, \r\nclimate change, energy and terrorism are among the \r\nmyriad pressing problems that confront humanity and \r\nrequire an urgent global response. It is thus imperative \r\nthat we continue to make concerted efforts to address \r\nthose challenges in pursuit of a better tomorrow. Their \r\nmagnitude clearly requires multilateral strategies and \r\nsolutions. \r\n Botswana calls upon all Members to unite in the \r\nsearch for solutions to those problems. It is imperative \r\nthat in our policies, actions and pronouncements, we \r\nalways seek to build greater international \r\nunderstanding. In our approach to managing relations \r\nbetween States, leaders are called upon to set a higher \r\nstandard. The language that we employ in international \r\nforums should not be belligerent or provocative, nor \r\nshould it be calculated to shame or humiliate other \r\nleaders. Member States should not host military or \r\nrebel groups that operate from their territories against \r\ntheir neighbours. \r\n In our international discourse, we must aim to \r\nbuild and facilitate agreement on common goals. In \r\nthat respect, we must exercise restraint by avoiding the \r\noften frequent temptation to recall diplomats from each \r\nother’s capitals, including purely for solidarity reasons. \r\nSuch action is unfortunate and outdated, as it only \r\nleads to a breakdown in communication. \r\n As we meet here, let us always remind ourselves \r\nof the solemn commitments that we, as the peoples of \r\nthe world, have undertaken to end war and human \r\nsuffering. Botswana calls upon all States, especially the \r\nmajor Powers, to set an example by refraining from the \r\nuse of weapons in resolving conflicts. Military \r\nconfrontation is, unfortunately, always a demonstration \r\nof the failure of the will to use diplomacy, of the urge \r\nto show off military superiority or of the inability to \r\nemploy resources and technological advances to \r\nimprove human lives. \r\n Sustainable economic growth, development and \r\nthe eradication of poverty are central to our \r\ndevelopment agenda as developing countries. Poverty \r\nis undoubtedly one of the most critical challenges \r\nfacing our people. Achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and combating poverty in its many \r\ndimensions are interrelated and mutually reinforcing \r\nobjectives. Thus, their attainment should be our \r\nprimary preoccupation. \r\n Botswana welcomes the initiatives introduced by \r\nsome development partners that seek to take a more \r\nfocused approach to Africa’s economic and \r\ndevelopment problems. Those initiatives include the \r\nLomé Conventions and the successor arrangements \r\nbetween the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, on \r\nthe one hand, and the European Union, on the other; \r\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United \r\nStates; the Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 22 \r\n \r\nDevelopment; the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation; \r\nand the Africa-India Framework for Cooperation. \r\n Botswana has always made effective use of the \r\nresources made available by our cooperating partners. \r\nIt is important that more be done to help developing \r\ncountries embark on the path of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We are convinced that, as we receive \r\nmuch-needed assistance, we must envisage a day and \r\ntime when there will be no need for such assistance \r\nbecause we are all able to stand on our own. \r\n This year marks the midpoint towards the 2015 \r\ntarget for attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nanalytical and informative reports regarding progress \r\nin the implementation of our common commitments \r\nand our shared future. We also welcome the work of \r\nthe high-level meetings held to take stock of progress \r\nmade. That will no doubt provide impetus for the \r\nexpeditious implementation of our commitments. \r\n The Secretary-General’s reports indicate a mixed \r\nand uneven score. It is clearly evident that while we \r\nhave made real progress in some areas, much remains \r\nto be done over the next seven years if we are to \r\nachieve our goals. In other words, we are seriously \r\nbehind schedule on every target, among countries and \r\nwithin countries that need to eradicate poverty and \r\nreduce human suffering. \r\n In addition to revealing gaps, the process has \r\nhighlighted emerging challenges that hinder the \r\nattainment of targets across the spectrum of human \r\ndevelopment. It has also emphasized the serious need \r\nto fast-track the pace of implementation if we are to \r\nhave any notable impact. The achievement of those \r\ngoals is our shared responsibility. It is thus imperative \r\nthat all of us, individually and collectively, do our part \r\nto accelerate progress towards a better quality of life \r\nfor our people. \r\n Our people deserve a life free from fear and want, \r\nin an environment that offers equal opportunity for all. \r\nThat is not a privilege, but a fundamental human right \r\nthat each State has a duty to respect, protect and fulfil. \r\nFor our people, that should mean universal access to \r\neducation, health, shelter, clean water and \r\ninfrastructure, as well as living in a safe and secure \r\nenvironment. Fully honouring our commitments is the \r\nkey to realizing those expectations. \r\n The following facts should trouble our collective \r\nconscience. More than one quarter of the children \r\nyounger than 5 in the developing world are \r\nunderweight. That amounts to 143 million underweight \r\nchildren in developing countries. Children in \r\ndeveloping countries continue to die from preventable \r\ndiseases such as malaria. The approximately 4 billion \r\ncases of diarrhoea per annum cause 2.2 million deaths, \r\nmostly among children under 5. Approximately \r\n6 million people are blind as a result of trachoma, a \r\ndisease caused by lack of clean water combined with \r\npoor hygiene practices. In sub-Saharan Africa, a \r\nwoman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is a staggering \r\n1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized \r\ncountries. Finally, HIV is spreading faster than we can \r\nprovide universal access to prevention, treatment, \r\nsupport and care. \r\n Clearly, closing those gaps will entail more than \r\nour reaffirmations; it urgently necessitates sustained \r\nand strong political commitment and leadership; sound \r\nand appropriate national policies, matched with \r\nincreased official development assistance and technical \r\nsupport from the international system; stepped-up \r\nparticipation and combined efforts by Governments, \r\ncivil society and the private sector; fairer, transparent \r\nand inclusive international trade regimes; more global \r\npartnerships to assist developing countries; full \r\nimplementation of debt-relief initiatives; greater access \r\nto markets; and other innovative international support \r\nmeasures to finance development. \r\n The search for global peace and security remains \r\na matter of vital interest to my delegation. While we \r\nmay have made significant strides in promoting peace \r\nthrough conflict prevention and resolution, through \r\npost-conflict recovery and through peacebuilding, \r\nconflicts continue to flare up, thus making the \r\nrestoration of peace a remote possibility for some in \r\nthe world. \r\n My own continent, Africa, plays host to a large \r\nnumber of conflicts. The scourge of war has claimed \r\nmany lives and caused untold human suffering. \r\nSubstantial time, energy and financial resources have \r\nbeen expended, with little or no success. The United \r\nNations Charter implores us, as the international \r\ncommunity, to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war by employing all diplomatic efforts and \r\ntools at our disposal. \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n23 08-53135 \r\n \r\n I am pleased to note that commendable strides \r\nhave been made in placing some countries, such as \r\nLiberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau, on a firm \r\npath of national reconstruction, post-conflict recovery \r\nand peacebuilding. Regrettably, the peoples of Africa \r\ncontinue to face hunger and death in the Darfur region \r\nof the Sudan, Somalia and Chad, among other places.  \r\n My delegation is particularly concerned about the \r\never-worsening situation in the Darfur region of the \r\nSudan. It is disconcerting that armed hostilities \r\ncontinue, despite the efforts of the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union through the development of the \r\nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur. We call on the parties to commit to political \r\ndialogue in the search for lasting peace and to fully \r\nutilize the good offices of His Excellency Mr. Djibril \r\nBassole, who has recently been appointed to facilitate \r\nthe peace process. \r\n With respect to Somalia, Botswana welcomes the \r\nsigning of the Djibouti Agreement on 9 June 2008 by \r\nthe Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and \r\nthe Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. We call \r\nupon all Somali political forces to commit to an all-\r\ninclusive political process so that the long-suffering \r\npeople of Somali can also live in peace.  \r\n My delegation further calls on the international \r\ncommunity to continue assisting the people of Somali \r\nwith much-needed humanitarian aid. In the same vein, \r\nwe remind the political leaders of the Somali people to \r\nput the interests of the people of Somalia above their \r\nown, so that the focus can be on the search for a lasting \r\npolitical settlement to the problems facing their \r\ncountry. \r\n The success of the United Nations in delivering \r\non our expectations and common ideals must be \r\nmatched by adequate resources, appropriate mandates, \r\nstructures and policy guidance. Botswana strongly \r\nbelieves in the instrumentality of the United Nations. \r\nIn that regard, we are committed to paying our \r\nassessed contributions in full and on time. We therefore \r\ncall upon all Members to do the same, so that this \r\nmachinery, which is the motor that powers \r\nmultilateralism, does not run out of steam. \r\n There can be no doubt that any organization — \r\nand the United Nations in particular — must be \r\nconstantly reformed or renewed if it is to continue to \r\nbe relevant and responsive to the needs of its members. \r\nWe are pleased that there has been some measure of \r\nprogress in implementing the set of reforms mandated \r\nby the 2005 World Summit. \r\n Allow me to conclude my remarks by once again \r\ncalling on each and every one of us to live up to the \r\nhigh expectations of this Organization by honouring \r\nour commitments. Botswana reaffirms its abiding faith \r\nin this body, which unites the peoples of the world for \r\na higher purpose. It is our hope that as we meet here, \r\nwe will succeed in building greater international \r\nunderstanding across regions, cultures, language and \r\nfaiths, because we are all human and because of the \r\nhumanity of others. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and African Integration of \r\nChad. \r\n Mr. Mahamat (Chad) (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I would \r\nlike to most warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, \r\non your election to presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-third session. The delegation of Chad is \r\nconvinced that your qualities and experience in the \r\narea of international relations will ensure success for \r\nour current session, and we would like to assure you of \r\nour cooperation as you carry out your mission. I would \r\nalso like to express our gratitude to your predecessor \r\nfor having skilfully and insightfully steered the work of \r\nthe Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also pay a \r\nwell-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Ban Ki-moon, for his commitment to \r\nupholding and promoting the ideals of our Organization.  \r\n The sixty-third session is being held at a time \r\nwhen the world is facing many challenges. The armed \r\nconflicts affecting essentially all continents are \r\ncompounded by the food, energy and financial crises \r\nthat endanger the most vulnerable populations. Those \r\nrecurring crises are genuine handicaps to implementing \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), to which \r\nthe international community has committed itself.  \r\n Chad, like many other countries, found itself \r\nearly on in an adverse political, social and economic \r\nsituation, despite the implementation of its national \r\ngrowth and poverty reduction strategy. That strategy, \r\nwhich was updated in 2008, is, however, the best \r\nframework for cooperation geared towards pooling all \r\nnational and international efforts that are essentially \r\naimed at achieving the MDGs. To be sure, the \r\nMillennium Declaration was welcomed in its time as a \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 24 \r\n \r\nmajor step in the international community’s awareness \r\nof the considerable lag of many of its members with \r\nrespect to development.  \r\n The Declaration and the MDGs, which we \r\nadopted in 2000 to eradicate poverty by 2015, are \r\ntoday still the most appropriate response to the \r\nproblems of poverty that many countries, including my \r\nown, continue to face. Those problems include \r\nshortfalls in terms of the resources necessary to fund \r\nour programmes, but also, and particularly, the unrest \r\nthat has resulted from the many attempts at \r\ndestabilization and that is worsened by incursions of \r\nmercenaries and armed militias of all kinds. The most \r\nnotable of such incidents took place in April 2006 and \r\nFebruary 2008.  \r\n To be sure, the development of our oil, which \r\nbegan in 2003, has given the country additional \r\nresources. But those resources do not, unfortunately, \r\nmeet our needs. Outside assistance is therefore \r\nnecessary in a number of areas in order to build our \r\ncapacities to better meet the challenges of poverty.  \r\n Contributions by our partners — although we \r\nwould like to reiterate our gratitude to them and \r\ncommend their commitment to us — need to be \r\nadapted. Such contributions should, as a priority, be \r\naimed at building the country’s ability to take action, in \r\nparticular by developing its natural wealth, and should \r\nprovide more substantial financial and technical \r\nsupport in that context.  \r\n More flexible conditions with respect to easing \r\nthe external debt of poor countries are indispensable. \r\nGreater attention should also be given to the economic \r\nproblems facing developing countries, specifically \r\nthose in Africa, where the future of some could be \r\nthreatened by the lack of competitiveness of their \r\nexport products because of measures taken by their \r\ncompetitors in the North. My country hopes that the \r\noutpouring of solidarity that underpinned the launching \r\nof the MDGs process will be revived in order to reduce \r\ninequalities, which worsen poverty and which are \r\nultimately sources of tension, with unpredictable \r\nconsequences. At any rate, Chad continues to be \r\ndetermined to do its utmost to improve the living \r\nconditions of its people within the framework of the \r\nMDGs. \r\n I would like to commend the efforts of our \r\nOrganization in eradicating hotspots of tension that are \r\nmajor obstacles to the implementation of development \r\ngoals. The Darfur crisis is an example of that, due to \r\nthe burden that it has placed on Chad as a result of its \r\neconomic, social and environmental repercussions. The \r\npresence in eastern Chad of 290,000 Sudanese refugees \r\nand 180,000 displaced Chadians is a matter of major \r\nconcern, for both Chad and for the international \r\ncommunity. We welcome the international community’s \r\nunprecedented mobilization in that regard.  \r\n Nevertheless, the fate of the host populations \r\nshould be given greater attention, in order to restore \r\nthe balances that were upset by that massive inflow. In \r\nthat in that part of the world a true tragedy is \r\noccurring, and it weighs on our collective conscience. I \r\nwould like to issue here a heartfelt appeal for a lasting \r\nsolution to that crisis.  \r\n Furthermore, my country welcomes the extension \r\nby the Security Council of the mandate of the African \r\nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur \r\n(UNAMID). Chad is persuaded that the international \r\ncommunity, having assessed the suffering of the people \r\nof Darfur, will strengthen the operational capacities of \r\nUNAMID by providing it with all the appropriate \r\nresources so that it can effectively carry out its mission \r\nand establish the necessary conditions for a \r\ncomprehensive and lasting settlement to the crisis.  \r\n We believe that it is essential to recall here that, \r\nsince the crisis broke out in Darfur, my country has \r\nspared no effort to assist its Sudanese brothers in \r\nfinding a peaceful settlement to the conflict facing \r\nthem. In August 2003, His Excellency Idriss Deby Itno \r\nwas the first foreign head of State personally to travel \r\nto El-Fasher to express his solidarity and support for \r\nhis Sudanese counterpart, Omer Hassan Al-Bashir, \r\nwhile calling on the Sudanese rebels to lay down their \r\narms and agree to a political settlement. We would \r\nrecall the decisive role he played as mediator to reach \r\nmany peace agreements between the Sudanese \r\nGovernment and its opposition.  \r\n Similarly, aware of the close linkage between \r\nstability in Chad and the settlement of the crisis in \r\nDarfur, he has always worked for the normalization of \r\nrelations between the two countries. It is in that spirit \r\nthat the Government of Chad welcomed the decision of \r\nthe Sudan to restore diplomatic relations with Chad at \r\nthe meeting of the Contact Group tasked with \r\nimplementing the Dakar Agreement, held in Asmara on \r\n12 September.  \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n25 08-53135 \r\n \r\n At that time, the Government of Chad called the \r\nContact Group to witness the sincere commitment of \r\nthe two parties towards a lasting normalization of their \r\nrelations. Here, I reiterate the gratitude of the \r\nGovernment of Chad to the member countries of the \r\nContact Group, institutions and friendly countries for \r\nthe key positive roles that they continue to play in \r\nsupporting Chad and the Sudan on that path. \r\n From this rostrum, we would like to commend the \r\nclose cooperation among the United Nations Mission in \r\nthe Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT), \r\nthe European Union-led peacekeeping force and the \r\nGovernment of Chad. The strengthening of the \r\nmandate of MINURCAT offers new prospects for \r\ndeveloping relations between Chad and the United \r\nNations, taking into account the experience accrued \r\nduring the preceding mandate. The need for greater \r\neffectiveness of the international presence in Chad \r\nrequires dynamic cooperation between the various \r\nparties. \r\n Despite the repeated attacks of mercenaries, the \r\nrepercussions of which on the life of the nation have \r\nbeen devastating, the Government of Chad, under the \r\nimpetus of His Excellency Idriss Deby Itno, President \r\nof the Republic and Head of State, remains committed \r\nto pursuing political dialogue with the democratic \r\nopposition and with the armed movements in order to \r\nbring about national harmony. The tangible results of \r\nthat policy are the formation on 23 April 2008 of a \r\nbroad-based Government, led by Youssouf Saleh \r\nAbbas, which includes leading personalities from the \r\ndemocratic opposition. We are also pleased to note the \r\nreturn to legality of several members of the armed \r\nmovements under the Sirte agreement of 25 October \r\n2007.  \r\n We confirm that the political dialogue, initiated \r\nby the agreement of 13 August 2007 and briefly \r\ninterrupted by the tragic events of February 2008, has \r\nresumed its work. It is taking place in a climate of trust \r\nand understanding and naturally will continue, with the \r\nassistance of our partners, towards the holding of free \r\nand transparent elections. Here, I would like to \r\nreiterate very solemnly to those partners the gratitude \r\nof the Government and people of Chad for their \r\nvaluable support in facilitating that dialogue. \r\n After that overview on national political issues, \r\nwe would like to address some international challenges \r\nfacing our Organization.  \r\n The setback in the recent negotiations in Geneva \r\nraises questions with respect to the ability to establish a \r\njust and equitable global trade system that takes into \r\naccount the legitimate aspirations of developing \r\ncountries, the most vulnerable in the world economy. \r\nWhat is more, despite the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to reduce tensions and spare the world the \r\nhorrors of armed conflict, unfortunately we continue to \r\nsee theatres of confrontation emerge on all continents. \r\nThe unbearable sight of thousands of women, children \r\nand elderly people displaced or cast into exile in the \r\nwake of those conflicts should persuade the \r\ninternational community to be more responsible.  \r\n Armed conflicts and the atrocities they cause are \r\na breeding ground for terrorism. That scourge is \r\nanother challenge to and major concern for the \r\ninternational community. My country supports the \r\nefforts of the United Nations to fight for its complete \r\neradication, but also for greater justice in addressing \r\ninternational issues.  \r\n On issues concerning nuclear matters, we \r\nreaffirm our country’s unswerving position, which is to \r\nrespect the sovereign will of States to acquire nuclear \r\npower for civilian purposes. \r\n With respect to conflicts on the African continent, \r\nwe are pleased to note the joint efforts of the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations to settle them peacefully \r\nand enduringly. Thus, we welcome the normalization \r\nof the political and military situation in Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nKenya and the Comoros. In the Horn of Africa, Chad \r\nsupports the efforts of the African Union to restore \r\npeace and national harmony in Somalia. In Zimbabwe, \r\nwe welcome the political agreement reached between \r\nthe primary Zimbabwean political players thanks to the \r\nmediation of President Thabo Mbeke, to whom we pay \r\nwell-deserved tribute.  \r\n In conclusion, within the framework of reform of \r\nthe bodies of the United Nations, and more particularly \r\nthe Security Council, I should like to reiterate the \r\nurgent appeal of my country to the Assembly and to the \r\nmembers of the Security Council for a just and fair \r\nreform that takes into account the legitimate \r\naspirations of the African continent. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Basile Ikouebe, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and La Francophonie of the Republic of the \r\nCongo. \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 26 \r\n \r\n Mr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation welcomes your inspired election, Sir, to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session, \r\nwhich is being held at a particularly important moment \r\nin the life of our Organization, given the numerous \r\nchallenges that we have to face. The robust messages \r\nthat you yourself have issued here clearly indicate that \r\nyou are fully aware of the magnitude of what is at \r\nstake. As is so well suggested by the Secretary-General \r\nin his report on the activities of the Organization \r\n(A/63/1), more than ever before the world’s problems \r\nrequire concerted and coordinated actions. \r\n We commend the Secretary-General on the \r\nresolute action that he has undertaken since the \r\nbeginning of his mandate. We highly appreciate his \r\ndynamism, his realism and the increasing interest that \r\nhe brings to matters of peace, security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Congo, who was \r\nunable personally to attend this general debate, has \r\ninstructed me to share with the members of the \r\nAssembly a few thoughts on developments in our \r\nworld. \r\n The challenges that we have to tackle \r\nimmediately are numerous. They are related to peace, \r\nsecurity, and threats to people’s lives and to nations, \r\nheightened by the food, energy and financial crises, as \r\nwell as natural disasters and climate change. \r\n By placing emphasis on the notion of solidarity, \r\nwhich we fully support, you have certainly illustrated, \r\nMr. President, the risk we run of losing our identity, an \r\noption that can only offer partial, even uncertain, \r\nsolutions to the challenges that confront us. Here, we \r\nreaffirm that the United Nations offers us the ideal \r\nframework to work together in search of lasting \r\nsolutions. That is the meaning underlying our ongoing \r\nattachment to multilateralism. \r\n Recent events in different parts of the world, \r\nparticularly in Europe, remind us that peace and \r\nsecurity rest on a fragile foundation, even where such \r\nmatters seem to have been solved definitively. Africa, \r\nstill at the heart of the concerns of the international \r\ncommunity and top of the agenda of the Security \r\nCouncil because of the conflicts that continue to \r\njeopardize progress and to hinder implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), will not \r\nsolve its problems with declarations of good intentions. \r\n The high-level meeting on Africa’s needs that \r\nwas held on 22 September revealed that it is time to \r\nmove from promises to sustainable action. That is why \r\nwe welcome the adoption of the declaration that \r\nmarked that important event. Similarly, we salute the \r\nhigh-level meeting for the MDGs that concluded here \r\non 25 September.  \r\n As we all know, the stabilization of the situation \r\nin countries in conflict and the building of peace in \r\nothers would not have been possible without the \r\nsustained efforts of the United Nations and other \r\nbilateral and multilateral partners. The African Union \r\nand subregional African organizations continue to act \r\nresolutely and often with limited resources to meet \r\nthose challenges. Thanks to all such efforts, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, to cite the example of our \r\nneighbouring country, is working to restore peace and \r\nsecurity through dialogue among the Government, the \r\nopposition and rebel movements. \r\n Still with respect to our subregion of Central \r\nAfrica, we call on the international community to step \r\nup its efforts to help stabilize the situation in the \r\neastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly \r\nby supporting the Government of that country in its \r\nfight against rebel movements and other negative \r\nforces. In that context, the entry into force in June of \r\nthe Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the \r\nGreat Lakes Region will usher in a new climate of \r\nconfidence in that nerve centre of our continent. My \r\nGovernment is committed to fully playing its role in \r\nthat process, which will greatly contribute to \r\nstabilizing to the situation. \r\n With regard to the crisis between Chad and the \r\nSudan, we encourage those two countries to pursue \r\nevery effort to normalize their relations and consolidate \r\npeace in the region. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nresumption of diplomatic relations between the two \r\ncountries — an initiative that must be consolidated \r\nthrough the establishment of military monitoring units \r\nalong the common border. Those units need to be \r\nadequately equipped, in implementation of the Dakar \r\nAgreement signed in March 2008. \r\n As African Union co-mediator with Libya in that \r\ncrisis, Congo will spare no effort in helping to bring \r\nthose two brotherly countries to respect the \r\nengagements undertaken and to act always in good \r\nfaith in order to establish a definitive peace between \r\nand around them. \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n27 08-53135 \r\n \r\n Solving the conflict in Darfur would contribute \r\nlargely to that end. That is why we make an urgent \r\nappeal for the effective deployment of the troops of the \r\nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur (UNAMID), which should be supplied with all \r\nnecessary equipment to become operational and \r\nefficient. \r\n For its part, my country recently completed the \r\npreparatory phase for a police unit composed of 140 \r\npersonnel that is now at the disposal of UNAMID. \r\nHowever, the international community should also \r\nwork tirelessly to implement of the Abuja Agreement \r\non Darfur. Non-signatories who are violating that \r\nAgreement must be strongly pressured to return to the \r\nnegotiating table. In that context, we believe that it is \r\ncounterproductive to carry out the indictment against \r\nthe Head of State of the Sudan. \r\n With respect to Africa yet again, we welcome the \r\nsettlement of the crisis in Kenya and the process of \r\nreconciliation in Zimbabwe, and call on African \r\npolitical actors in power and in opposition to respect \r\nthe verdict of the ballot box. \r\n In its desire to participate in the collective effort \r\nin the area of peace and security, my country reaffirms \r\nits full commitment to the fight against terrorism, the \r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, drug \r\ntrafficking and human trafficking. Congo remains fully \r\ncommitted to strict compliance with the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in all its facets. \r\n Congo calls on the international community to \r\nconsider as a matter of urgency the resolution of the \r\nMiddle East conflict on the basis of commitments \r\nalready undertaken, particularly the road map of the \r\nQuartet and the Arab peace initiative.  \r\n Our commitment to multilateralism leads us to \r\nbelieve that there is a pressing need to pursue the work \r\nof United Nations reform, and particularly that of the \r\nSecurity Council. In keeping with the African position \r\non that issue, my country welcomes the decision to \r\nlaunch, before 31 January 2009, intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that should finally enable that matter to \r\ngenuinely move forward. \r\n It is right that our present agenda includes the \r\nmatter of the effects of climate change on the \r\nenvironment, which is one of the major challenges of \r\nour times. My country is particularly sensitive to that \r\nissue since it has within its borders a part of the \r\nenormous Congo basin, the world’s second ecological \r\nlung after Amazonia. The countries bordering the basin \r\nhave a great responsibility to humanity in the \r\nmanagement and sustainable exploitation of these \r\necosystems, which they are shouldering in a \r\ndetermined and encouraging manner. \r\n While endorsing the conclusions of last year’s \r\nBali Conference, which laid the groundwork for the \r\npost-Kyoto period, the States of the Congo basin \r\nbelieve that global policies on the preservation of \r\nforest equilibriums should establish compensation \r\nmechanisms. Those would include the creation of \r\nsubstitute economies to benefit the populations in the \r\nareas involved. \r\n In expressing those concerns, I take the \r\nopportunity to announce that Congo will host in \r\nBrazzaville, from 27 to 30 October 2008, the sixth \r\nWorld Forum on Sustainable Development, devoted to \r\nassessing the progress achieved in the implementation \r\nof Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation, particularly concerning strategic, \r\ncredible and pertinent partnerships towards achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n On the economic and social front, we welcome \r\nthe focus at this session on sustainable development \r\nand implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. The analyses carried out here last week indicate \r\nthat African States have made significant progress, \r\nwith a rate of growth of approximately 6 per cent per \r\nannum, and that, as emphasized in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, Africa is resolutely on the right path \r\nand should continue to pursue those commendable \r\nefforts, particularly since it varies between countries \r\nand regions. \r\n Nevertheless, such efforts and the promising \r\noutcomes they may yield require genuine, continuous \r\nand tangible international support. That is why our \r\npartners must keep their promises. \r\n The current Chair of the African Union, President \r\nKikwete of the United Republic of Tanzania, brilliantly \r\ndescribed to the Assembly the situation in our \r\ncontinent and indicated the way forward. We fully \r\nendorse the presentation he made here and on other \r\noccasions. We welcome the different partnerships that \r\nAfrica has established with its traditional friends and \r\nwith new ones. Here once again, the commitments need \r\nto be brought to fruition. \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 28 \r\n \r\n Our continent is resolutely committed to the \r\nbattle for progress, which has several facets. That is \r\nwhy we attach great importance to matters of \r\ndemocracy, good governance and respect for human \r\nrights in the framework of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism, a pillar of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development. Several African countries have \r\nagreed to submit to periodic evaluations that represent \r\na sort of right to positive interference in the affairs of \r\nother member States in matters that normally fall under \r\nnational jurisdiction. Congo has voluntarily subscribed \r\nto the process, illustrating Africa’s devotion to the fight \r\nagainst bad governance, corruption, human rights \r\nviolations and impunity. \r\n It is therefore inconceivable that certain foreign \r\njudges should confer upon themselves the right to drag \r\nAfrican leaders to their national courts in the name of \r\nthe principle of universal jurisdiction — a rule that \r\nseems to be applied exclusively to Africa since, as we \r\nhave already seen, the same principle was soon \r\ndropped when it targeted leaders of powerful States. It \r\nis regrettable that international jurisdiction, while \r\nremaining respectable, seems to be following a path of \r\njudiciary spite against African leaders. \r\n In that regard, Africa has become an \r\nexperimentation ground for dangerous and even hateful \r\npractices. The sad memories of such other negative \r\nexperiences as slavery, the slave trade and colonization \r\nare enough for us. President Kikwete was right to raise \r\nthis issue here, in application of a decision taken \r\nduring the summit of the African Union held in Sharma \r\nel-Sheikh in Egypt. \r\n The Republic of the Congo had a particularly \r\nrough patch in the 1990s and managed, thanks to the \r\npolitical will of the Government, all political actors \r\nand the civil society, to achieve national reconciliation. \r\nThat climate of peace made possible the organization \r\nof legislative elections in 2007 and municipal and local \r\nelections in 2008 in an atmosphere of calm and \r\nserenity, despite irregularities identified during the \r\nvoting process. Nevertheless, the transparency and \r\ncredibility of the process were not disputed by the \r\ninternational observers. \r\n With the irregularities corrected, it is in the same \r\nclimate of calm and serenity that we are organizing the \r\n2009 presidential election, in accordance with our \r\nConstitution. The climate of restored peace has led to \r\nan increasingly reassuring economic situation that is \r\nsupported by improved budgetary planning and better \r\ndebt management within the framework of the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the \r\nrigorous measures that today have enabled Congo to \r\nfocus more ambitiously on its development and on the \r\nprogressive achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Within that framework and in a \r\nparticipatory manner, with the assistance of the United \r\nNations Development Programme, we drafted a \r\npoverty reduction strategy paper that was approved by \r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. \r\n By way of illustration, the principle measures \r\ntaken towards the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in the sensitive areas of education \r\nand health care focus on from free access to education \r\nand textbooks, the establishment of a drug purchase \r\ncentre, the distribution of treated mosquito nets to the \r\npopulation, and free access to HIV/AIDS testing, \r\ncheckups and anti-retroviral medication. \r\n Such efforts, however encouraging they may be, \r\ncan bear fruit in the long run only with the support of \r\nexternal partners and in a favourable international \r\ncontext as regards such thorny issues as debt, trade, \r\nofficial development assistance, financing for \r\ndevelopment and, above all, international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Members may now easily understand why a \r\nmodest member of the international community such as \r\nCongo is so deeply invested in the existence and the \r\nwork of our collective home, the United Nations. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Youssouf Bakayoko, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n Mr. Bakayoko (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): \r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I would like to express my \r\nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your outstanding \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session. Your personal qualities, your in-\r\ndepth knowledge of our Organization and your great \r\nexperience in international affairs have enabled you to \r\ngather around you the support of the entire Assembly \r\nand certainly augur well for the success of your work. I \r\nalso extend my congratulations to the members of your \r\nBureau. Please be assured that our warmest wishes will \r\naccompany you throughout the session, which, under \r\nyour leadership, is sure to be crowned with success. \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n29 08-53135 \r\n \r\n Allow me to pay fitting tribute to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for his work as \r\nPresident.  \r\n I would also like to welcome Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon and wish him every success as he \r\nattempts to accomplish his noble and lofty mission to \r\nconsolidate and strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations. My delegation and I assure him of our fullest \r\ncooperation and support as he seeks peaceful solutions \r\nto the problems of the world. I convey to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral the deepest gratitude and the sincere thanks of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire, and the Ivorian Government \r\nfor his personal involvement in solving the crisis in my \r\ncountry. The Ivorian people still recall his historic visit \r\nof 23 and 24 April to Côte d’Ivoire. My country will \r\ncontinue to support him and, through him, the United \r\nNations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire so that it may \r\nsuccessfully accomplish its mission. \r\n May I also express the thanks and gratitude of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Côte d’Ivoire to the \r\ninternational community, and in particular to the \r\nFrench Government, for their commitment and their \r\nefforts, through Operation Licorne, to restore peace in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire.  \r\n I take this opportunity once again to pay sincere \r\ntribute to the facilitator, Mr. Blaise Compaore, \r\nPresident of Burkina Faso and Chairman-in-Office of \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS), for his untiring efforts on behalf of the \r\npeace process in Côte d’Ivoire, in particular in the \r\nframework of the follow-up mechanism of the \r\nOuagadougou Political Agreement signed on 4 March \r\n2007. My thanks also go to the heads of State of the \r\nAfrican Union who spared no effort to resolve the \r\ncrisis roiling Côte d’Ivoire since 19 September 2002. \r\n I wish solemnly to reaffirm the determination of \r\nmy country to emerge from the current crisis by \r\norganizing free, open and transparent elections. \r\nAttesting to our resolve was the launch on \r\n15 September 2008, of the penultimate phase of the \r\nelectoral process, which consists of identifying the \r\nvoting population and individual voters. \r\n The efforts of the international community to \r\nensure the return of peace to Côte d’Ivoire — relying \r\non regional organizations such as ECOWAS and the \r\nAfrican Union, pursuant to President Gbagbo’s \r\napproach to resolving conflicts — are gradually \r\nbearing fruit and giving rise to improvements in the \r\nsecurity situation throughout the country. For that \r\nreason, my country would be grateful if the United \r\nNations could take into account the new situation and \r\nonce again consider lowering its security index for \r\nCôte d’Ivoire. \r\n In the same vein, my country would like to see \r\nthe Security Council sanctions committee accede to its \r\nrequest, made on 26 September 2007 from this very \r\nrostrum, for the lifting of individual sanctions imposed \r\non a number of Ivorian citizens. Allow me also, in the \r\nframework of the reorganization of the new Republican \r\nArmy called upon to maintain public order and \r\nsecurity, to appeal once again for the partial lifting of \r\nthe arms embargo, as requested by President Laurent \r\nGbagbo on that same occasion. \r\n More than ever before, our Organization must \r\nshow that it is able to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity throughout the world. In that context, as was \r\nindicated by President Laurent Gbagbo at the high-\r\nlevel debate on the relationship between the United \r\nNations and regional organizations, this universal \r\nOrganization must open broad new avenues for peace \r\nin the world. Indeed, the United Nations, as an \r\ninstrument prepared at the end of the Second World \r\nWar to guarantee international peace, is no longer \r\nadapted to the current world. Therefore, as wished by a \r\nnumber of Member States, the reform of the United \r\nNations is necessary, and we must clarify its goals and \r\nits missions.  \r\n That is why my delegation feels that, after years \r\nof work and reflection on United Nations reform, the \r\ntime has now come to bring the process to a close. \r\nUnfortunately, with regard to the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, although there may be a consensus on the \r\nneed to increase the number of members of the Council \r\nin order to make it more broadly representative, there \r\nare still differences with regard to its composition, the \r\nextension of the right of veto to potential new \r\npermanent members, and the improvement of its \r\nworking methods. In that respect, my country reaffirms \r\nits adherence to the African Common Position on that \r\nmatter.  \r\n The persistent search for peace will be in vain if \r\nwe do not bring greater justice to international \r\neconomic relations. In other words, there will be no \r\ngenuine peace so long as intolerable differences remain \r\nin the living conditions between various population \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 30 \r\n \r\ngroups, on one hand, and between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries, on the other.  \r\n In that respect, I welcome the efforts undertaken \r\nby a number of countries to promote economic \r\ncooperation between them and the countries of Africa. \r\nExamples include cooperation with the European \r\ncountries through the European Union; with Japan \r\nthrough the Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment; with China through the Forum on China-\r\nAfrica Cooperation; with the United States through the \r\nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act; and with India \r\nand Turkey through their respective partnerships. \r\n Economic globalization was meant to open new \r\nhorizons for international cooperation, but overall it \r\nhas not been beneficial to developing countries because \r\nof the fragile nature of their economic structures. It \r\nwould therefore be an illusion to imagine that market \r\nforces alone can help the development of the poorest \r\ncountries. We must therefore regulate trade by adopting \r\nrules agreed at the global level, because only a fair \r\ninternational trade system can contribute to the \r\nexpansion of underdeveloped economies.  \r\n In that respect, my delegation deplores the failure \r\nin July of World Trade Organization negotiations that \r\nshould have breathed new life into international \r\ncooperation and created conditions for developing \r\ncountries to benefit from globalization through trade \r\nand investment. \r\n The issue of debt remains a cause for concern to a \r\nnumber of developing countries. That is why I would \r\nlike to welcome all the praiseworthy initiatives \r\nundertaken to alleviate its effects on the economies of \r\nthose countries.  \r\n The recent food crisis, whose devastating effects \r\nare being felt in several countries, requires the \r\ninternational community to go beyond mere promises \r\nand to act together, taking specific innovative and \r\ncourageous actions and measures that can, above all, \r\nbring hope to the situation and find a global response \r\nto a problem that has become global. \r\n In that regard, I welcome the establishment by the \r\nSecretary-General of the High-Level Task Force on the \r\nGlobal Food Security Crisis and the efforts of \r\ndeveloping countries to come to the rescue of those in \r\ntheir countries who have been the most seriously \r\naffected by the food crisis.  \r\n My country also welcomes the implementation of \r\nthe Centres of Excellence project carried out by the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \r\naimed at strengthening South-South cooperation \r\nscientific research in the agricultural field. With that in \r\nmind, President Laurent Gbagbo recommends the \r\ncreation of a solidarity-based mechanism through \r\nwhich exporting countries would provide food to \r\nimporting countries and the establishment of a United \r\nNations food stabilization fund. \r\n The energy crisis being felt throughout the world, \r\nin addition to its negative effects, is demonstrating \r\nonce again the fragility of the economies of a large \r\nnumber of countries. Although the development of \r\nbiofuels seems to be a good alternative to fossil \r\nfuels — which, much to our consternation, are running \r\nout — we must also ensure that their production is not \r\ncarried out to the detriment of agriculture, the main \r\npurpose of which is to feed the people of the world. \r\nThat is why, in the interest of current and future \r\ngenerations, we must think carefully and deeply about \r\nthe adoption and development of new, renewable \r\nsources of energy. \r\n With regard to all of the crises and difficulties \r\nthat humanity is facing, now more than ever before the \r\ninternational community must translate into action the \r\nidea of solidarity and cooperation, as contained in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, in order to restore \r\ncredibility to the Organization. Such solidarity should \r\nbe demonstrated first and foremost by the \r\nimplementation of the commitments undertaken by the \r\nindustrialized countries to devote at least 0.7 per cent \r\nof their gross national income to official development \r\nassistance.  \r\n To that end, I would like to welcome all \r\ninitiatives aimed at helping developing countries in \r\ngeneral, and African countries in particular, to \r\novercome their current economic situation. The \r\ndiligent implementation of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development, the main goal of which is to \r\nfight poverty, is part of such an approach. It is on that \r\nnote of hope that my delegation calls on the \r\ninternational community to seek solutions to current \r\nchallenges in a United Nations that is more democratic \r\nand that responds to each and every one of its \r\nMembers. \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n31 08-53135 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Nur Uulu Dosbol, State \r\nSecretary of Kyrgyzstan. \r\n Mr. Dosbol (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on \r\nyour election to the post of President of the General \r\nAssembly and wish the work of the sixty-third session \r\nevery success under your guidance. I should like to \r\nexpress deep gratitude to Srgjan Kerim for successfully \r\nsteering the work of the Assembly’s previous session. \r\n Today, the role of the United Nations as the \r\nuniversal international forum that can make an \r\nimportant contribution to strengthening international \r\npeace and security is seen as increasingly important. \r\nThe high-level plenary meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs and the high-level event on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) gave us every \r\nreason to believe that joint efforts can generate \r\nappropriate measures for existing crises and this \r\nsession of the General Assembly will serve as an \r\nadditional contribution towards achieving the MDGs. \r\n In today’s conditions, when there are rapid \r\nchanges worldwide, enhancing the role of the United \r\nNations and the effectiveness of its work is \r\nincreasingly important. Further strengthening the \r\nauthority and potential of the Organization in the \r\npresent situation requires that we pursue reform of the \r\nentire United Nations system, so that it can, above all, \r\nact as the guarantor of international peace and security \r\nand also effectively and flexibly respond to existing \r\nproblems. \r\n For us, the most important issue is strengthening \r\nthe Security Council in the cause of preserving \r\ninternational law and order and tranquillity. In \r\nadvocating expansion of Council membership and, the \r\nenhancement of its working methods, the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic believes that Council reform must be based \r\non the principles of universality, effectiveness and \r\nequitable geographic representation.  \r\n For its part, the Kyrgyz Republic will continue to \r\ncontribute as much as it can to maintaining peace and \r\nsecurity. In that regard, we would like to reaffirm that \r\nfor the first time our country has put forth its \r\ncandidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for the term 2012 and 2013. Realizing the true \r\nbreadth of responsibilities of members in that key body \r\nof the United Nations, the Kyrgyz Republic will do its \r\nutmost to address global problems. \r\n The rapid changes taking place in the world have \r\nnot bypassed the Kyrgyz Republic. Such challenges as \r\nclimate change and the food and energy crises have \r\nhighlighted the extreme importance of collective \r\nefforts, both regional and global. Such circumstances \r\nclearly heighten the role of the United Nations and \r\nother, regional organizations in consolidating efforts to \r\nwork out effective mechanisms for preventing and \r\nresponding to challenges and threats. \r\n As is known, the water resources of Central Asia \r\ncome from the high alpine glaciers and snowfields in \r\nKyrgyzstan. However, at the beginning of this year we \r\nwere already encountering the consequences of \r\nwarming and of a period of water scarcity, which \r\nnegatively impacted the delivery of electricity to both \r\ndomestic and external markets. The environmental \r\nsituation is also aggravated by the fact that in our \r\ncountry earthquakes, landslides and flooding have \r\nrecurred in recent years and in such conditions the fact \r\nthat our country has a considerable number of storage \r\nsites for radioactive waste poses a serious threat not \r\nonly to national, but also to regional security.  \r\n As international experience demonstrates, peace \r\nand security cannot be maintained without establishing \r\nthe elementary conditions that are necessary for a \r\ndecent existence. In order to achieve security and \r\ndevelopment goals simultaneously, the international \r\ncommunity must pursue a more balanced policy. \r\nParticular attention should consistently be given to \r\nissues of law and order in society. \r\n From this rostrum, I would like to thank all \r\nUnited Nations Member countries for their unanimous \r\nsupport for the initiative of the President of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic, Kurmanbek Bakiev, on declaring 20 February \r\nas World Day of Social Justice. The pursuit of policies \r\nof social justice is aimed at sustainable development of \r\nthe human potential and at enhancing the interaction of \r\nStates in order to eradicate poverty, achieve gender \r\nbalance and to address migration issues. \r\n We are grateful to Member States for their \r\nsupport at the previous Assembly session for resolution \r\n62/196, on sustainable mountain development, under \r\nwhich Bishkek will hold the second Global Mountain \r\nSummit in October 2009 to assess the activities of the \r\ninternational community with respect to sustainable \r\nmountain development. I take this opportunity to \r\nreiterate our invitation to interested countries to take \r\npart in that international forum, and also to express the \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 32 \r\n \r\nhope that Members will provide active support to that \r\ninitiative of the international community.  \r\n I would like to touch upon several issues that are \r\nat the centre of attention for the delegation of the \r\nKyrgyz Republic. Most unfortunately, there are still \r\nradioactive waste storage sites in the Kyrgyz Republic. \r\nProperly maintaining them and preventing a regional \r\nenvironmental disaster stand high on the agenda. We \r\nare grateful to the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, which has seriously paid attention to the \r\nneed to solve that problem. I am confident that at the \r\ninternational forum on resolving issues of the storage \r\nof uranium tailings, to be held in Bishkek this autumn, \r\nthe international community, under the United Nations \r\ncoordinating role, will take effective measures, \r\nincluding financial and technical assistance, aimed at \r\nensuring their security. \r\n We would also like to express firm support for \r\nthe establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in \r\nCentral Asia, since that would contribute to \r\nstrengthening global and regional security. In that \r\nregard, we hope to receive the broad support of the \r\ninternational community for the related draft resolution \r\nat this Assembly session. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to note that the \r\ninternational community is going through a complex \r\nperiod. Member States must reaffirm their readiness to \r\nseek practical solutions to the most pressing problems \r\nof our time. The international community rightfully \r\nexpects that we all will work out effective measures to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations in order to find ways to \r\nresolve the challenges of the new millennium. \r\nTherefore, we need to do our utmost, so that the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly will be \r\nremembered as a session of reform. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Giadalla A. Ettalhi, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya. \r\n Mr. Ettalhi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Allow me at the outset, Sir, to express my \r\ncountry’s heartfelt congratulations to you on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session. We are confident that your \r\nexperience and wisdom will crown our work with \r\nsuccess and will result in further progress on the many \r\nimportant issues on the Assembly’s agenda. \r\n I would like also to express my appreciation to \r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the efforts he \r\nmade during his presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits previous session. Our thanks go also to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his persistent \r\nefforts to implement United Nations resolutions and \r\nrealize the purposes of the Charter. \r\n Humanity faces many problems and serious \r\nchallenges, which, no matter how great, would not be \r\nimpossible to resolve if we evinced the necessary \r\npolitical will and made concerted efforts to overcome \r\nthem. My country recognizes that peace, security and \r\nstability constitute the cornerstone of progress and \r\ndevelopment, especially in Africa. It has therefore \r\nmade all possible efforts to resolve disputes in Africa, \r\nas was the case in Chad, the Central African Republic \r\nand the Sudan. My country has also contributed, along \r\nwith other African countries and pursuant to \r\nresolutions of the African Union Peace and Security \r\nCouncil, towards putting an end to the insurgency in \r\nthe island of Anjouan in the Union of the Comoros. \r\n United Nations reform remains a matter of \r\nprimary importance to the international community. \r\nReform has indeed become a necessity dictated by the \r\ncurrent dynamics in the international arena. However, \r\nwhile we commend the efforts of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on Security Council Reform, which \r\nwas chaired by the President of the General Assembly \r\nduring its previous session, we feel that the process has \r\nbeen extremely slow because of broad differences \r\nbetween the various groups. Nonetheless, we welcome \r\nthe consensus reached on the recommendations of the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group at the end of the sixty-\r\nsecond session (decision 62/557). However, we believe \r\nthat genuine United Nations reform is reform which \r\nplaces decision-making power in the hands of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the world parliament, while \r\ntransforming the Security Council into an executive \r\nbody that enforces the Assembly’s decisions. We can \r\nthus surmount the veto obstacle which has \r\nconcentrated international decision-making power in \r\nthe five permanent members of the Council. \r\n My country therefore calls for the convening of a \r\nhigh-level General Assembly meeting on United \r\nNations reform, to be held in a European country so \r\nthat all world leaders can attend. In that context, we \r\nwish to emphasize that Africa, which is the only \r\ncontinent with no permanent representation on the \r\nSecurity Council despite the fact that it represents more \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n33 08-53135 \r\n \r\nthan one fourth of the total membership of the United \r\nNations, deserves permanent membership on an equal \r\nfooting with other geographical regions. That \r\nrepresentation should be given to the African Union \r\nrather than to any one of its members. \r\n We have reached the midpoint of the period set \r\nfor the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We express our concern regarding the inability \r\nof many developing countries and least developed \r\ncountries, especially in Africa, to achieve the Goals, \r\nwe affirm that it is imperative for the international \r\ncommunity to fulfil its commitments in the field of \r\ndevelopment assistance, address problems related to \r\nthe international trade system, make the World Trade \r\nOrganization more effective, and facilitate the \r\naccession to membership of that organization by \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n In that regard, we welcomed the convening of the \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on \r\n22 September 2008, on the theme of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs. We support the political \r\ndeclaration adopted at the meeting (resolution 63/1). \r\nWe also welcomed the high-level event on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), held on \r\n25 September 2008. Furthermore, we look forward to \r\nthe international follow-up conference on financing for \r\ndevelopment to review the implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha and we hope \r\nthat the Conference will achieve its desired goals. \r\n In that context, my country has contributed to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nthrough its proposed “Qadhafi Road” across the desert, \r\nwhich will connect the northern parts of the African \r\ncontinent with the western and southern parts. It will \r\nbe an important artery that will enhance trade among \r\nthe continent’s countries. \r\n Corruption, bribery, money-laundering and the \r\nsmuggling of funds from illegal sources are among the \r\nmajor factors which hamper development and the \r\nachievement of the MDGs in developing countries, \r\nespecially in Africa. Huge damage is inflicted on \r\ndeveloping countries as a result of the smuggling of \r\nfunds across borders, which deprives those countries of \r\nthe benefits of those funds, which are deposited in \r\nforeign banks. As the General Assembly has \r\nemphasized in its decisions, those funds should be \r\nreturned to countries of origin. I must also note that \r\nthere are safe havens that have always been associated \r\nwith banking confidentiality, to the point where they \r\nhave become known as corridors for criminal money-\r\nlaundering and safe havens for stolen funds and \r\nplundered wealth. \r\n It is no longer acceptable to remain silent on \r\nthose safe havens, whose financial institutions provide \r\nprotection for money generated from corruption and \r\ncrime. Those funds are often used by terrorist groups \r\nand organized crime gangs to threaten the security and \r\nstability of States. \r\n My country was among the first States to \r\nhighlight the food crisis. The High-Level Conference \r\non Food Security, held in Rome in June, was a \r\nresponsible response from world leaders to the food \r\ncrisis and the unprecedented increases in the prices of \r\nfood, basic commodities and energy. I would like in \r\nthat respect to thank the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Director-General of the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization for their efforts in that \r\nfield.  \r\n To confront that problem, my country has \r\nadopted development projects and programmes which \r\naim to achieve food security through improved \r\ninvestment in the agricultural sector and through \r\nsupport for farmers. In the African sphere, my country \r\nhas allocated $5 billion to finance several development \r\nprojects in order to achieve food security in a number \r\nof Sahelo-Saharan African States. It is also in the \r\nprocess of financing seven additional projects in \r\nAfrican countries. \r\n The food crisis has been a topic of personal \r\nconcern for our brother Muammar al-Qadhafi, the \r\nLeader of the Revolution, who in June, at the tenth \r\nsession of the summit conference of the Community of \r\nSahelo-Saharan States, held in Benin, presented his \r\ninitiative for the provision of food and the mitigation \r\nof the hunger crisis in Africa. The initiative is based on \r\nthe establishment of a self-sustaining mechanism and \r\nthe harnessing of modern machinery and technology to \r\nreclaim lands and farm vast areas in Africa, through the \r\nlaunching of a green campaign. The campaign will \r\nmake it possible to farm vast areas of land in the \r\nSahelo-Saharan States by mechanized means instead of \r\ntraditional methods. \r\n Developed countries can help Africa find a \r\nsolution to the food crisis by increasing agricultural \r\ndevelopment assistance and investment in projects such \r\nas hydroelectric dams and development projects in lake \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 34 \r\n \r\nareas, such as Lake Chad. Such investments will make \r\na great contribution to agricultural development on the \r\nAfrican continent. \r\n Climate change and its negative impact will \r\nhamper the development efforts of many developing \r\ncountries and will undermine their development gains. \r\nLibya is among the States affected by climate change, \r\nas it is located in an arid/semi-arid geographical area, \r\nand most of its territory is desert. Libya also suffers \r\nfrom desertification and water scarcity. Libya has made \r\npersistent efforts to address these challenges, including \r\nthrough the Great Man-Made River Project network, \r\nwhich is intended to overcome the problems of \r\ndesertification and drought. \r\n Confronting climate change requires an effective \r\nand well coordinated international effort, based on the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility \r\nagreed upon in the Rio Conference. From that \r\nperspective, we call for accelerated efforts to reach a \r\ncomprehensive international agreement to address the \r\nroot causes of climate change and to provide \r\nadaptation measures to developing countries. \r\n We believe in the purposes of the United Nations \r\nCharter, which calls for the establishment of a world in \r\nwhich peace and security prevail. The elimination of \r\nweapons of mass destruction is an essential factor in \r\nbuilding confidence and promoting world peace, \r\nstability and security, and my country has voluntarily \r\nrelinquished all its programmes to develop \r\ninternationally prohibited weapons of mass destruction, \r\nwhile emphasizing the right to use atomic energy for \r\npeaceful purposes. But we strongly oppose the use of \r\ndouble standards on the issue of nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation. We condemn any discrimination \r\nbetween one State and another in this respect and call \r\nfor making the Middle East a region free from all \r\nweapons of mass destruction. \r\n The Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel mines \r\nshould be reviewed to reflect the concerns of many \r\ncountries, such as requiring States that lay landmines to \r\nremove them and to address the inflicted damage, \r\nincluding by providing treatment and compensation for \r\nthe injured and by rehabilitating the damaged \r\nenvironment. \r\n Terrorism remains a matter of concern for all \r\nmembers of the international community. Despite all \r\nthe measures taken to combat terrorism, thanks to \r\ninternational cooperation under the United Nations \r\numbrella, this issue still poses a challenge to the \r\ninternational community and is an obstacle to the \r\nachievement of development, security and stability in \r\nmany parts of the world. \r\n Eradicating this phenomenon requires the \r\nadoption of a specific definition of terrorism. Terrorism \r\nmust not be confused with the legitimate right of \r\npeoples to resist foreign occupation and claim their \r\nright to freedom, independence and self-determination. \r\nFurthermore, associating terrorism with any specific \r\nreligion, nationality or culture is bound to inflame \r\nconflict among civilizations, religions and cultures. \r\nSuch a situation is untenable and is incompatible with \r\nthe goal of international relations based on mutual \r\nrespect among States, cultures and systems of \r\ngovernment. In this regard, we wish to point out that \r\npolicies and practices of foreign occupation based on \r\nviolations of human rights guaranteed by all \r\ninternational instruments and conventions constitute \r\none of the worst forms of terrorism in our modern \r\nworld. \r\n The United Nations Convention relating to the \r\nStatus of Refugees, adopted in 1951, provides an ideal \r\ndefinition of refugee status, in addition to the definition \r\nincluded in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. It is therefore regrettable that some States use \r\nthis concept to camouflage their intentions regarding \r\nother States. Under the pretext of fostering democracy \r\nand respect for human rights, which is a noble goal, \r\nthose countries have opened the door of political \r\nasylum to all seekers, including thieves, smugglers of \r\ntheir countries’ wealth, fugitives from prosecution and \r\nterrorists, enabling them to continue their subversive \r\nactivities against their home countries. My country \r\nbelieves that it is of paramount importance to establish \r\ninternational criteria and controls governing political \r\nasylum, while carefully observing human rights. We \r\nalso believe that such criteria and controls would have \r\na positive impact on the fight against corruption and \r\nterrorism while promoting democracy and preventing \r\narmed conflict. \r\n The Palestinian people are still suffering under \r\nthe Israeli occupation, which has lasted for more than \r\n60 years, subjecting Palestinians to the worst forms of \r\noccupation and destruction directed against civilians. \r\nThe achievement of peace and stability in the area is \r\nimpeded by the unjust siege imposed by the Israeli \r\noccupation forces on 1.5 million Palestinians in the \r\nGaza Strip and the continuation of settlement activities \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n35 08-53135 \r\n \r\non occupied Palestinian territory, ignoring and \r\ndeliberately breaching the principles of international \r\nhumanitarian law and the principles of human rights, \r\ncoupled with policies of home demolition, land \r\nconfiscation, the displacement of populations and the \r\nintensification of arrests. \r\n Indeed, peace and stability in the area can only be \r\nattained through the return of all Palestinian refugees \r\nto their homeland and the establishment of a \r\ndemocratic State on the land of Palestine in which \r\nArabs and Jews can live, enjoying full rights and \r\nobligations, as our brother, the Leader of the \r\nRevolution, proposed in his recent book. \r\n My country has always emphasized that there can \r\nbe no comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless \r\nthe Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the \r\nLebanese territories is ended. In this framework, we \r\nreiterate our call to the international community to \r\ndemand and enforce the withdrawal of Israeli \r\noccupation forces from all occupied Arab lands and to \r\nensure that their rightful owners are compensated for \r\ndamages suffered as a consequence of that occupation. \r\n My country welcomes the tangible improvement \r\nin the security situation in Iraq and believes that \r\nstability in that fraternal country depends on the \r\nachievement of genuine national reconciliation which \r\nwould overcome sectarian and religious differences \r\nand lead to the withdrawal of foreign forces. \r\n We express our deep concern at the situation in \r\nSomalia. My country is of the opinion that the \r\ninternational community should expeditiously dispatch \r\nforces to that country, in coordination with the African \r\nUnion, to protect civilians and humanitarian workers \r\nand to assist in the implementation of the Djibouti \r\nAgreement, in order to put an end to the long suffering \r\nof the Somali people. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to Her Excellency Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa, \r\nchairperson of the delegation of the Republic of \r\nEcuador. \r\n Ms. Espinosa (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): I am \r\nhighly honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of \r\nthe Government of the citizen revolution, of the \r\nPresident of Ecuador, Rafael Correa Delgado, and of \r\nthe people of Ecuador at these paradoxical times of \r\nboth crisis and hope. \r\n Allow me to convey the fraternal greetings of the \r\npeople and the Government of Ecuador to you, Sir — \r\nPresident of the Assembly and former Minister of \r\nForeign Affairs of Nicaragua, Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann — on your election to such an important \r\nposition. We agree with you on the need to attach the \r\nhighest priority to the fight to eradicate poverty and to \r\npay special attention to relevant issues such as climate \r\nchange, the energy and food crises, human rights, \r\ndisarmament, the rights of women and children and the \r\npreservation of cultural and biodiversity. \r\n With the end of the cold war, we believed, not \r\nwithout reason, that the confrontation between two \r\nways of life and two great Powers would give way to \r\nthe solution of the planet’s pressing economic and \r\nsocial problems. Two decades have elapsed since that \r\nhistoric date, and we see with concern that that crisis \r\nhas deepened, that social cohesion is harder to obtain, \r\nthat new threats to security have intensified, and that \r\nthe use of force and the number of conflicts have \r\nincreased. \r\n My country is convinced that the strengthening of \r\nthe multilateral system is an imperative in the world of \r\ntoday. We have no other option to guarantee peace and \r\nsecurity in the world than to renew our political \r\ndecision to progress in the reform of the United \r\nNations system, and in particular of the Security \r\nCouncil. This year, we have taken a significant step in \r\nthat direction with the General Assembly’s adoption of \r\ndecision 62/557, which provides a general framework \r\nto advance these negotiations. Let us hope that we \r\nmake progress. \r\n The debate on the need to increase membership \r\nof the Security Council and to democratize the Council \r\nand make its working methods more transparent and \r\ninclusive is undoubtedly one of the fundamental \r\nelements of the reform process. However, at the same \r\ntime, we should not forget that another of the central \r\npoints required to give back to the United Nations the \r\nrole that it should have is to strengthen its democratic \r\nand representative organ par excellence, namely the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Nor should we forget that any process of reform \r\nwill be incomplete if it does not include the \r\ndemocratization of the organizations that make up the \r\nUnited Nations system. In the twenty-first century we \r\ncannot continue working with a system in which most \r\ncountries cannot access the decision-making bodies \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 36 \r\n \r\nbecause of structures that respond to the special \r\ncircumstances that prevailed when those bodies were \r\ncreated. We need to urgently build a multilateral \r\nsystem that responds promptly and effectively to \r\ntoday’s challenges and that recognizes the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law, such as the sovereign \r\nequality of States. Only with thorough-going reform \r\ncan the United Nations regain the lead role that it \r\nshould play in international affairs. \r\n We cannot understand that States Members of this \r\nOrganization continue supporting peacekeeping \r\nbudgets of billions of dollars and yet have serious \r\nconcerns about increasing budgets for development \r\nprogrammes, especially fundamentally important \r\nprogrammes to fight poverty, HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\nthe effects of climate change. Our citizens are \r\nbeginning to call us to account with regard to the \r\nresources that we contribute annually to this \r\nOrganization and the results that we obtain. That is \r\nwhy we consider positive the proposal stressed by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to commence a \r\ntruly thorough and democratic reform of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n To work for development and the reduction of \r\npoverty and to deal adequately with the needs of \r\nmillions of human beings who are struggling today in \r\nmisery, disease and despair, is an absolute requirement \r\nin order to guarantee peace and security. Therefore, my \r\ncountry assigns high priority to economic and social \r\npolicies aimed at overcoming unequal distribution of \r\nincome and employment, and at guaranteeing the right \r\nof its population to health, education and social \r\nsecurity. These efforts must be accompanied by \r\ndecisive and effective support from developed \r\ncountries, through a substantial increase in official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) — cooperation that \r\ncannot be subject to conditions of any kind and that \r\nmust supplement national efforts based on sovereign \r\ndevelopment policies. \r\n There is still much to do, however, if we are to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nAs we have stated in several forums, Ecuador \r\nconsiders that the MDGs are basic minima for survival \r\nand that we should go beyond them. In our country, we \r\nhave left behind an outdated concept based on market \r\ngrowth indices and are currently working actively and \r\nwith impressive results on increasing the quality of life \r\nof the citizens of Ecuador. We call this concept of \r\n“buen vivir” — “living well” — which means living \r\nwith dignity and in accordance with our cultural values \r\nand in harmony with nature. \r\n Ecuador and, I am sure, all developing countries \r\nhope that the Doha Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment will produce positive results for our \r\ncountries, such as access to external financing for \r\ndevelopment, relief of the external debt servicing \r\nburden, the reform of international financial \r\ninstitutions and the effective alignment of official \r\ndevelopment assistance with the national strategies and \r\npolicies adopted by sovereign countries, together with \r\nthe strong commitment of donor countries to allocate at \r\nleast 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) to official development assistance. Middle-\r\nincome countries deserve special attention since they \r\naccount for more than 41 per cent of the poor of the \r\nplanet. \r\n The United Nations should actively promote \r\nSouth-South cooperation. We believe that the High-\r\nlevel United Nations Conference on South-South \r\nCooperation to be convened by the General Assembly \r\nin 2009 is evidence of the role which the Organization \r\nshould play in this area. It will constitute an excellent \r\nopportunity to strengthen and enhance this important \r\ncooperation. \r\n Likewise, it is necessary that there be a special \r\nplace for economic and social development in the work \r\nof the United Nations. Without a total fulfilment of the \r\ncommitments that have been undertaken and without a \r\ntrue inclusion of our needs based on our own agendas \r\nfor development, we cannot talk of international peace \r\nand security. \r\n Ecuador wishes to highlight, at this juncture, the \r\nvital role that the Group of 77 and China and the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) have to play on these \r\nand other issues. During the last NAM ministerial \r\nmeeting, held in Tehran, Iran, in July, we reiterated our \r\nconviction that this important mechanism of political \r\nagreement is central in ensuring that our countries’ \r\ninterests are fully taken into account. \r\n Ecuador also assigns importance to the role of the \r\nUnited Nations in establishing a world order based on \r\nrespect for international law, the norms and principles \r\nset out in the Charter, and the promotion of and respect \r\nfor human rights international humanitarian Law. \r\n My country supports the actions the United \r\nNations is taking to address the serious security \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n37 08-53135 \r\n \r\nproblems we face, such as the fight against terrorism, \r\nthe worldwide drug problem and the fight against \r\ntransnational organized crime. Accordingly, we \r\nwelcomed the recent positive outcome of the first \r\nreview of progress in the implementation of the Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. My country will continue \r\nto give its support to these important initiatives. \r\n Ecuador also supports negotiations aimed at the \r\neventual adoption of a legally binding convention on \r\nterrorism. However, we believe that, given the vitally \r\nimportant implications of the issue, such a convention \r\nshould expressly and unequivocally cover the \r\nobligations of all States to fight terrorism in the \r\nframework of international law, human rights, \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the principles and \r\nnorms established in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n The fight against terrorism cannot be an excuse \r\nfor some States to feel released from their obligation to \r\nrespect fundamental norms of international law, such as \r\nrespect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity \r\nof other States and non-intervention in their internal \r\naffairs. Likewise, the violation of the human rights of \r\nalleged terrorists — who have been tortured, \r\nincarcerated in clandestine military prisons and \r\ndeprived of the basic right to defend themselves — \r\nalso constitutes a very serious precedent. These \r\npractices must be condemned by the international \r\ncommunity. Sovereignty, the inviolability of territory, \r\nthe non-use of force and non-intervention in the affairs \r\nof other States are the only guarantee for peaceful \r\ncoexistence among the peoples of the world. \r\n Ecuador assigns high priority to the actions of the \r\ninternational community to ensure that States comply \r\nin good faith with their human rights obligations. We \r\nbelieve that the Human Rights Council, which is \r\nconsolidating its position as the best mechanism for the \r\npreservation and protection of human rights, has \r\nsubstantially improved its working methods. But all \r\ncountries must make an effort to set aside their \r\npolitical objectives to allow the Council to effectively \r\nfulfil the purposes for which it was created. \r\n Ecuador feels that the Universal Periodic Review \r\nsystem established by the Council is a good step in that \r\ndirection. For this reason, my country was glad to be \r\nthe second country in the world to submit its review, in \r\nApril 2008. On that occasion, we reiterated our \r\nunfailing commitment to respect for and protection of \r\nhuman rights. We were able to share with the \r\ninternational community the substantial advances made \r\nin the implementation of our national human rights \r\nplan, and we voluntarily made additional \r\ncommitments. \r\n The adoption of the United Nations Declaration \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was a milestone. \r\nMy country was actively involved in the negotiation of \r\nthat important instrument and is now committed to its \r\nimplementation and follow-up in order to contribute to \r\nnational policies aimed at consolidating the identity, \r\nculture and effective exercise of the political, economic \r\nand cultural rights of the indigenous peoples and \r\nnationalities of Ecuador. \r\n The issue of migration is of singular importance \r\nto my country. The Government of Ecuador is therefore \r\nimplementing a comprehensive immigration policy, \r\ncontained in the National Human Development Plan \r\nfor Migration, that includes programmes, projects and \r\nactions aimed at guaranteeing the protection and a \r\ncomprehensive approach to migration issues and of \r\nmigrant persons, regardless of their origin or \r\nadministrative status within the territory of a State. \r\n The free movement of persons is a right that must \r\nbe protected, and I believe that no Government \r\nrepresented here is opposed to that. However, the \r\nregulation of such movement must be in strict \r\naccordance with the principles of international \r\nhumanitarian law and the human rights of migrants. In \r\nthe words of the President of my country, Rafael \r\nCorrea Delgado, “there are no illegal human beings, \r\nonly practices that violate the rights of persons”. In \r\nthat respect, we are deeply disturbed by the return \r\ndirective issued by the European Union. We believe \r\nthat, today more than ever before, our countries must \r\njoin together to demand effective compliance with the \r\nobligations arising from international human rights and \r\non migration agreements. Emigration and return must \r\nboth be an expression of freedom. \r\n The new Constitution of Ecuador establishes the \r\nprinciple of universal citizenship, the free movement of \r\nall peoples on Earth, and a progressive end to the \r\nconcept of “foreignness” in order to transform unequal \r\nrelations between countries, especially between the \r\nNorth and the South. We must not forget that migration \r\nis often a direct consequence of economic models \r\nbased on exclusion, in which the market, the \r\naccumulation of wealth and selfishness paper over the \r\ntrue needs of human beings. \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 38 \r\n \r\n As I said, humanism and solidarity are \r\nfundamental principles that guide the actions of the \r\nGovernment of Ecuador. That is why my country \r\nadopted a State policy on refugees on 16 September of \r\nthis year. That policy is aimed at providing \r\ncomprehensive assistance to persons placed under the \r\nprotection of Ecuador. \r\n We will honour all our national and international \r\ncommitments regarding refuge seekers, but we need \r\nthe determined cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity. We must not forget that Ecuador is \r\ncurrently the country with the largest number of \r\npersons in need of international protection in the entire \r\nwestern hemisphere. According to studies conducted by \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees, there are approximately 200,000 \r\nColombian citizens in need of international protection \r\nwithin the territory of Ecuador. Ecuador is now \r\nimplementing a process of extended registration, which \r\nwill benefit thousands of Colombian brothers in urgent \r\nneed of international protection. \r\n The severity of the world food crisis is an issue \r\nthat our countries must address in a comprehensive \r\nmanner while taking all of its dimensions into account. \r\nIn that respect, Ecuador believes that subsidies and \r\nother trade distortions have a serious impact on the \r\nagricultural sectors of developing countries. For that \r\nreason, Ecuador firmly supports the proposal to hold a \r\nspecial session on that issue during the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n In addition, Ecuador is compelled to highlight the \r\ncurrent financial crisis, which also deserves our \r\nOrganization’s particular attention. The crisis is further \r\nproof of the decline of our current economic system, \r\nwhich prioritizes speculative capital over productive \r\ncapital, threatens the common good and endangers the \r\ndevelopment prospects of the majority of world. It is \r\nnot a country-specific crisis, but a systemic crisis of \r\ncapitalism that calls for profound and comprehensive \r\nresponses. \r\n Ecuador’s foreign policy reflects its firm \r\ncommitment to disarmament and the non-proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction. Ecuador has not only \r\nadhered to international instruments in that field, but \r\nalso supports and carries out all the obligations \r\nemanating from those instruments in order to achieve \r\ntheir effective implementation. We are concerned by \r\nthe fact that there are countries that, regrettably, have \r\nnot adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, while others that have adhered to it \r\nare not meeting their obligations, especially in terms of \r\ndisarmament and the destruction of their arsenals. With \r\nregard to that policy issue, Ecuador welcomes the \r\nadoption, in Dublin in July, of the Convention on \r\nCluster Munitions. My country will sign the \r\nConvention in a ceremony to be held in Oslo on \r\n3 December 2008. \r\n Other issues of great concern to my country \r\ninclude the fight against transnational organized crime \r\nand its ramifications, the production and illicit traffic \r\nof narcotics, corruption, the manufacturing and illicit \r\ntraffic in small arms and light weapons, and human \r\ntrafficking. We believe that the United Nations has \r\ntaken decisive steps on those issues by adopting \r\ninternational conventions that allow for cooperation \r\nbetween our countries in the fight against those \r\nscourges. We believe that adequate and equitable \r\ninternational cooperation is essential. Such \r\ncooperation, as I said, must respond to the needs of our \r\ncountries and be aimed at supporting national policies. \r\n Ecuador is convinced that a strong and effective \r\nmultilateral system is the only means for the world to \r\novercome the problems it faces and, above all, to \r\nguarantee the well-being of peoples and international \r\npeace and security. It is therefore incumbent upon us to \r\ntransform the United Nations. \r\n To conclude, I have the pleasure of announcing to \r\nthe world that Ecuador has made a new step towards \r\nthe strengthening of our democracy. Yesterday, the \r\nEcuadorian nation approved by an ample majority a \r\nnew political Constitution — a new social pact based \r\non a transformed relationship between the State, the \r\neconomy and politics, creating a new model of \r\ndevelopment aimed at human welfare and harmony \r\nwith nature. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Carsten Staur, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Denmark. \r\n Mr. Staur (Denmark): My Government agrees \r\nentirely with the Secretary-General’s remarks at the \r\nopening of this debate. The world is on the eve of a \r\ngreat transition. The problems we face have grown \r\nmuch more complex, and our challenges are \r\nincreasingly those of collaboration rather than \r\nconfrontation. The quality of life in most parts of the \r\nworld has improved tremendously over recent decades, \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n39 08-53135 \r\n \r\nbut challenges remain, not least in sub-Saharan Africa. \r\nNew challenges, such as climate change, migration, \r\nincreasing energy and food prices and financial \r\ninstability, could all potentially give rise to embedded \r\nconflicts and further polarization. \r\n As President Sarkozy said last week in his \r\ncapacity as President of the European Union (EU), \r\ncontinued reform of the United Nations is crucial to \r\nimproving the ability of the United Nations to carry out \r\nits core business, which is and remains problem \r\nsolving. We must continue the progress made on \r\nsystem-wide coherence and on the Delivering as One \r\nagenda. As regards Security Council reform, Denmark \r\nwelcomes the agreement to initiate intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in the near future. At the election of \r\nSecurity Council members next month, Iceland is the \r\ncandidate for membership representing all the Nordic \r\ncountries. We are strongly backing Iceland’s \r\ncandidature. \r\n On climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel \r\non Climate Change reports have served to crystallize \r\nan international consensus on the need for action. That \r\nconsensus has been nurtured by the determined \r\nleadership of the Secretary-General, promoting global \r\naction to curb global warming, with the United Nations \r\nat its centre. \r\n Economic growth and environmental protection \r\nare fully compatible. The challenge is to establish a \r\nframework for low-carbon growth, in which increased \r\nenergy efficiency, increased use of renewable sources \r\nof energy, carbon capture and storage, and the \r\ndevelopment of a global carbon market are vital \r\nelements. \r\n Denmark will host the United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in Copenhagen in 2009. The goal \r\nis to reach an agreement on a successor to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, making it an ambitious and truly global \r\ninstrument. Momentum for a new comprehensive and \r\nambitious international climate agreement is growing \r\nday by day. \r\n During the past weeks, we have witnessed new \r\ncruel and meaningless acts of terrorism. The evil \r\nterrorist attack in Islamabad on the Marriott Hotel on \r\n20 September resulted in the loss of many innocent \r\nlives. Most of those who died were Pakistanis, but \r\nother nationalities were also included, one Danish \r\nperson among them. That attack and others came only a \r\nfew weeks after United Nations Member States had \r\nreaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We must respond \r\nto such despicable acts of fanaticism with great \r\ndetermination to strengthen international cooperation \r\nin that area. All United Nations bodies must join in the \r\nfight against terrorism. We hope that, at its present \r\nsession, the General Assembly will finally agree to a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\nIn addition, we must focus on due process and \r\nsanctions, as it is becoming increasingly clear that a \r\nlack of adequate due process is hampering the \r\nefficiency of the sanctions system. \r\n Sixty years after the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration on Human Rights, severe violations of \r\nhuman rights continue to take place. Extremists are \r\ntrying to instigate a clash of civilizations by creating \r\nmistrust and polarization among various civilizations, \r\ncultures and religions. It is a major challenge for the \r\nUnited Nations to counter those trends and to promote \r\nthe universality of human rights. \r\n The number of armed conflicts is steadily \r\ndecreasing. The United Nations has played a major role \r\nin ensuring that positive trend. However, several \r\nbloody and difficult conflicts remain high on the \r\ninternational agenda. \r\n In Afghanistan, measurable progress has been \r\nmade, but the security situation remains challenging. \r\nCorruption and drugs are undermining the \r\nachievements made and the long-term development of \r\nthe country. Denmark has significantly increased its \r\nengagement in the United Nations-mandated, NATO-\r\nled mission, and we have doubled our development \r\nassistance to Afghanistan. Much has been achieved, but \r\nthe United Nations needs to play a much stronger role \r\nin coordinating the international engagement. A lack of \r\nsuccess in Afghanistan would have serious regional \r\nramifications. \r\n In Africa, the deployment of the African Union-\r\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur has been \r\ndelayed owing to various factors, including actions by \r\nthe Government of the Sudan allowing attacks and \r\nkillings to go on. Those responsible for the grave \r\ncrimes committed in Darfur must be held accountable. \r\nFighting impunity is a prerequisite for sustainable \r\npeace. We thus stress the need to comply with Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1593 (2005) and express our strong \r\nsupport for the International Criminal Court.  \r\nA/63/PV.15  \r\n \r\n08-53135 40 \r\n \r\n In Zimbabwe, we hope that the power-sharing \r\nagreement will pave the way for durable peace and a \r\nreturn to democracy and rule of law, ending the \r\nsuffering of the people of that country.  \r\n In Somalia, the international community is trying \r\nhard to improve the deplorable situation on the ground \r\nand the prospects for a long-term political solution. \r\nThe scourge of piracy is one of the factors undermining \r\nstability in Somalia. The Danish navy is taking an \r\nactive role, together with the navies of other nations, in \r\naddressing that problem off the coast of Somalia and in \r\nthe region. We need to increase our common efforts to \r\naddress all aspects of fighting piracy, including \r\nstrengthening the international legal framework for \r\nhandling detained persons. Through the Copenhagen \r\nProcess Denmark has taken the lead on the broader \r\nissue of handling detainees in armed conflict. We \r\nbelieve that there are already valuable lessons here that \r\ncan also be applied in relation to piracy. \r\n In the Middle East, in spite of continuing \r\nviolence, effective regional and international \r\ndiplomacy has contributed to breaking the political \r\ndeadlock in Lebanon. The Palestinians and the Israeli \r\nGovernment are also making progress. We urge the \r\nparties to the Middle East conflict to honour road map \r\ncommitments and to settle their differences in \r\naccordance with the international agreements and the \r\nArab peace initiative. I should also like to take this \r\nopportunity to strongly condemn the unacceptable \r\nremarks made by the President of Iran calling for Israel \r\nto be wiped off the map. \r\n In Burma, Cyclone Nargis killed more than \r\n100,000 people earlier this year. The slow and \r\ninadequate reaction of the regime demonstrated its \r\ndisregard for the welfare of its own people. The United \r\nNations is working hard to ensure the initiation of a \r\ngenuine political dialogue between the Government \r\nand the political opposition as well as the release of all \r\npolitical prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. We \r\nstrongly support those efforts. \r\n In August, war erupted in the South Caucasus. \r\nThe conflict in Georgia has not only dramatically \r\naffected the region but clearly also entails \r\nrepercussions that go beyond it. However, not least \r\nbecause of the European Union and its French \r\npresidency, the international community has been able \r\nto contribute constructively to the process. Now it is up \r\nto all parties to the conflict to fulfil the conditions set \r\nout in the six-point agreement and the Moscow \r\nagreement and to act in a positive spirit to find long-\r\nterm solutions to the conflict in a peaceful manner that \r\nalso respects Georgia’s independence, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. \r\n This year saw a new country appear in the \r\nBalkans. The United Nations has played a substantial \r\nrole in promoting Kosovo’s development and is still \r\npresent in Kosovo with the United Nations Interim \r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), together \r\nwith a new substantial contribution from the EU \r\nregarding the rule of law: the European Union Rule of \r\nLaw Mission Kosovo. By reconfiguring UNMIK, the \r\nUnited Nations has demonstrated substantial \r\npragmatism and a willingness to cooperate actively \r\nwith the EU. Later this year, the United Nations is \r\nexpected to hand over to the EU Mission tasks related \r\nto the rule-of-law area, and we welcome that \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The good offices of the Secretary-General, the \r\nmediation and conflict prevention efforts of the United \r\nNations and its peacekeeping operations, which now \r\nentail 19 missions and more than 130,000 staff \r\nmembers, remain the backbone of United Nations \r\npeace and security efforts. However, we need to \r\nimprove the capacity of the United Nations system to \r\nassist countries in early phases of recovery after \r\nconflict as well as countries with very weak institutions \r\nthat might easily fall into conflict. That means building \r\na stronger bridge from humanitarian assistance, \r\npolitical good offices and peacekeeping efforts to early \r\nrecovery, peacebuilding, reconstruction and transitional \r\nassistance aimed at sustaining State-building and \r\npreventing weak States from lapsing back into conflict \r\nor chaos. The creation of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Peacebuilding Fund was \r\nimportant in strengthening the Organization’s capacity \r\nand capability to build and cross that bridge, but so far \r\nit is only a footbridge. Much more engineering and \r\ncraftsmanship are needed, including on the part of \r\nfunds and programmes. \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect was endorsed. We must \r\ndevelop that concept further and ensure that States do \r\ntheir utmost to protect their own citizens from \r\ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. We must discuss what the \r\ninternational community and the United Nations can do \r\nto assist States in meeting those obligations, and we \r\n A/63/PV.15\r\n \r\n41 08-53135 \r\n \r\nmust consider the means that are available to the \r\ninternational community when States manifestly fail to \r\nprotect their populations. \r\n Last week, an impressive number of heads of \r\nState and Government took part in the first high-level \r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Declaration and the \r\nestablishment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). We are not on track, but we are not \r\nsidetracked either. We all have to make extra effort if \r\nwe are to succeed, and we need to get our priorities \r\nright. A special focus on the empowerment of women \r\nis essential socially, politically and economically. \r\nIncreased investments in women are crucial across all \r\nthe MDGs, across all sectors. Gender equality is a \r\nbasic human right, and it is smart economics, too. On \r\nthat basis, the Danish Government has initiated a \r\nspecific call to action on gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women. \r\n Another cross-cutting factor that might determine \r\nsuccess or failure for all countries is governance. \r\nPolitical leadership, democratic institutions, the rule of \r\nlaw and respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms are called for not only nationally, but also \r\ninternationally. The international rule of law, with a \r\nstrong emphasis on respect for the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law, respect for human rights \r\nand fighting impunity, is a key to international peace \r\nand stability. The evidence is loud and clear, and we \r\nneed to focus our efforts. \r\n The evidence is equally loud and clear in another \r\narea. Sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind in its \r\ntrajectory towards achievement of the MDGs. The \r\nDanish Government has therefore established an \r\ninternational high-level commission on effective \r\ndevelopment cooperation with Africa. The aim of the \r\ncommission, in which a number of African leaders and \r\nUnited Nations officials are taking part, is to present \r\ncreative and concrete recommendations regarding a \r\ncross section of young people, employment and \r\neconomic growth. By May 2009, the commission will \r\npresent its ideas and concrete proposals on how \r\nAfrican countries and the international community can \r\naddress those challenges prior to the 2010 review of \r\nthe status of the implementation of the MDGs.  \r\n In conclusion, let me reaffirm the \r\ninterrelationship and interdependence of the issues that \r\nI have addressed. There can be no development without \r\nsecurity and human rights, and vice versa. Progress is \r\nneeded in all areas if we are to advance as a global \r\ncommunity. And we must advance — in the area of \r\ndevelopment, in the area of peace and security, in the \r\narea of human rights and in the many areas that \r\ntranscend borders. That can be achieved, however, only \r\nthrough multilateral cooperation in areas such as \r\ncounter-terrorism, non-proliferation, pandemics and \r\nclimate change. Multilateralism is our only response to \r\nthe challenges, risks and opportunities of an \r\ninterdependent and globalized world. It is our \r\nresponsibility to ensure that the United Nations is \r\nproperly equipped to address global challenges and \r\nglobal opportunities. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
