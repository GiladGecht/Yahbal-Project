(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: On this afternoon, the feast of \r\nSaint Michael, I appropriately begin by giving the floor \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Micheál Martin, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Ireland. \r\n Mr. Martin (Ireland): Mr. President, let me begin \r\nby warmly congratulating you on your election. You \r\nhave my very best wishes for a successful term in \r\noffice. \r\n This is my first opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly as Ireland’s Foreign Minister. It is a \r\ngreat honour and privilege to do so. Ireland believes \r\nstrongly in the purposes, principles and potential of the \r\nUnited Nations. Formed in the shadow of global war, \r\nthe United Nations embodies the idea of our common \r\nhumanity. We have a shared interest as well as a moral \r\nobligation to act on that common humanity in the \r\nworld. \r\n In this new century, when we speak of the \r\ninternational community, it cannot be as a vague \r\nplatitude or as a faceless scapegoat. Global challenges \r\nconfront us: climate change, economic turbulence, food \r\nand energy crises, HIV/AIDS and terrorism, among \r\nothers. We can either be an international community \r\npassively divided and at the mercy of those forces, or \r\nwe can be a community, in the true sense, of active \r\nparticipants united by our sense of mutual solidarity, \r\nour common sense of justice, our common desire for a \r\nbetter and peaceful future and a shared commitment to \r\ninternational law and the human rights of all. \r\n The United Nations is the indispensable \r\nframework for realizing the potential of that \r\ncommunity, as it has shown again and again. Ireland is \r\nproud to have played its distinctive part in that history \r\nand we are absolutely committed to playing a full part \r\nin its future. And let us be clear — the challenges we \r\nface have intensified in the past year. \r\n Over the past period, we have witnessed the \r\npotential fallout from the financial crisis for all \r\ncountries and not least, of course, for developing \r\ncountries. The depth of their concerns has been heard \r\nfrom this rostrum. We have all failed as yet to reach \r\nagreement on a balanced world trade deal. Rising fuel \r\nand food prices have exacted a particular toll on the \r\nworld’s most vulnerable and poor. The effects of \r\nclimate change, likewise, are placing a \r\ndisproportionate burden on those least equipped to \r\ncope. More than halfway towards the 2015 target date \r\nfor the Millennium Development Goals and despite \r\nsignificant progress in some areas, we have not made \r\nenough headway towards meeting them. The United \r\nNations must continue to take the lead in those efforts, \r\nwhile each of us as political leaders must recognize our \r\nduty to take effective action in support of goals that are \r\nonly increasing in relevance and urgency. \r\n The world needs a strong and effective United \r\nNations, and that is why, as a committed Member \r\nState, Ireland has long supported efforts to reform and \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 2 \r\n \r\nimprove its operation. I very much welcome and \r\nappreciate the priority that Secretary-General Ban has \r\nattached to that task. As he said when he took up \r\noffice, “the true measure of success of the United \r\nNations is not how much we promise, but how much \r\nwe deliver for those who need us most” (A/61/PV.31, \r\np. 9). Every Member State must play its part in \r\nensuring that it can fulfil its role. Ireland is therefore \r\nproud of the contribution it has made to the reform \r\nprocess. \r\n Most recently, we were pleased to work closely \r\nwith our good friend and colleague, Tanzania, in \r\nfacilitating consultations on greater system-wide \r\ncoherence in the United Nations, a vitally important \r\npart of the reform agenda. I would like to take the \r\nopportunity to express my deep appreciation of the \r\nconstructive spirit in which Member States and United \r\nNations agencies and staff approached the consultation \r\nprocess, chaired by Ambassadors Kavanagh and \r\nMahiga. Their report was welcomed in the consensus \r\nresolution adopted by the General Assembly on \r\n15 September. A lot, of course, remains to be done. We \r\nshould not shy away from issues just because they are \r\ndifficult to tackle. \r\n Taking forward the reform agenda does not, of \r\ncourse, mean losing sight of the real strengths and \r\nachievements of the United Nations, especially in \r\npeacekeeping. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary \r\nof the first occasion on which personnel of the Irish \r\nDefence Forces wore the blue beret. In the five decades \r\nsince, they have worn it with pride and distinction. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to offer them and \r\nthose with whom they have served my deepest personal \r\ngratitude. \r\n Of course, as the world continues to evolve, so \r\nwill our approach to peacekeeping. Regional \r\norganizations, such as the European Union, can and \r\nshould be expected to play an increasingly prominent \r\nrole in undertaking Security Council-mandated \r\noperations. I am particularly pleased that one such \r\nmission, the EU military operation in the Republic of \r\nChad, is under the very effective leadership of an \r\nIrishman, Lieutenant General Pat Nash. \r\n Last year, my predecessor expressed the hope \r\nthat, after almost 40 years, it would no longer be \r\nnecessary for Irish ministers to brief this Assembly on \r\nthe search for peace on the island of Ireland. I am \r\npleased to confirm that the task we now confront in \r\nIreland is no longer building peace, but securing and \r\nunderpinning it for the generations to come. Our \r\nhistory has, however, made us particularly conscious of \r\nthe huge human cost of conflict and the moral \r\nobligation we carry to prevent and to resolve it. We in \r\nIreland owe a debt of gratitude to all in the \r\ninternational community who lent their support to our \r\nsearch for peace. In that search, we were genuinely part \r\nof a community — concentric circles of other nations \r\nand international actors that provided goodwill and \r\nmomentum, moral support, concrete assistance, \r\nindependent mediation and facilitation when needed. \r\nAnchoring the process was a central partnership \r\nbetween the British and Irish Governments. So we \r\nknow the good that can be done and we now feel a \r\nspecial duty to try and repay some of that debt in kind. \r\n That is why my Government has established a \r\nconflict resolution unit within my ministry as a channel \r\nthrough which we can make our contribution. Its aim is \r\nto complement the work of others, especially that of \r\nthe United Nations. It will, in part, draw on the lessons \r\nwe have learned from our own experiences. As part of \r\nthat work, Nuala O’Loan, formerly the Police \r\nOmbudsman in Northern Ireland, who played a \r\nsignificant personal role in building confidence in the \r\nnew policing arrangements there, is now serving as our \r\nSpecial Envoy to Timor-Leste. \r\n Ireland’s commitment to peacekeeping, \r\npeacebuilding and conflict resolution extends to \r\nremoving not only the causes of conflict, but also the \r\nmeans. Creating a secure and stable world demands \r\neffective arms control and disarmament and the \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. Ireland was very \r\nproud last May to host the diplomatic conference that \r\ndelivered the Convention on Cluster Munitions, an \r\nhistoric agreement to ban the production and use of \r\nthose pernicious instruments of war. The Convention is \r\nstrong and ambitious. Each State party undertakes \r\nnever, in any circumstances, to use, develop, produce, \r\nacquire, stockpile, retain or transfer cluster munitions, \r\nor to assist any other party in doing so. It is \r\ncomprehensive and it provides for no exceptions. It \r\nsets new standards for assistance to victims and also, \r\nimportantly, for clearing affected areas. I would once \r\nagain like to express the deep appreciation of my \r\nGovernment for the constructive approach taken by \r\nMember States. Without it, such a significant step \r\nforward could not have been taken. The Convention \r\nwill open for signature in Oslo in December, and \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n3 08-53141 \r\n \r\nIreland will be among the first signatories. I strongly \r\nurge all Governments to do likewise. \r\n Peace and security must be accompanied by a \r\nfirm commitment to the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights. That remains at the very core of the \r\nUnited Nations mandate. In this, the sixtieth \r\nanniversary year of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, we must act with \r\nrenewed determination to make its promises a living \r\nreality for all of our people. That means improving the \r\nUnited Nations capacity to tackle abuses effectively \r\nwhenever and wherever they arise, ensuring a strong \r\nand vigilant Human Rights Council. \r\n This is also the tenth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute establishing the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). It has already carved out a vital \r\nrole for itself in bringing an end to impunity and in \r\ndemanding that the rule of law be upheld. Ireland \r\nremains strongly supportive of the ICC and its \r\nmandate, and urges all Member States to cooperate \r\nfully with its work. \r\n Eradicating world hunger and ending poverty is \r\none of the most urgent tasks we face. Realizing the \r\nvision of the Millennium Development Goals is a great \r\nchallenge, but it can be met. I am very proud that \r\nIreland is now the sixth largest aid donor in the world \r\nin terms of gross national product percentage. It is, I \r\nbelieve, a reflection of our values of solidarity and \r\nrespect for human dignity. As a committed member \r\nState, I am also gratified that the European Union and \r\nits member States continue to be the world’s leading \r\ndonor, accounting for some 60 per cent of the world’s \r\nofficial development assistance. \r\n In support of our efforts to secure the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, Ireland established a hunger task \r\nforce to determine the most effective contribution we \r\ncan make to tackling the root causes of hunger, \r\nparticularly in Africa. Comprising 15 renowned \r\ninternational experts, its report was launched by our \r\nPrime Minister, Taoiseach Brian Cowen, last week with \r\nthe participation of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \r\nThe report has highlighted three particular areas for \r\nfocus. First, we need to improve small-holder \r\nproductivity in Africa; the agricultural sector has been \r\nneglected for too long. Secondly, we need increased \r\nfocus on maternal and infant undernutrition; a bad start \r\nmakes life an uphill struggle from day one. Thirdly, the \r\nreport states clearly that we do not need new \r\ncommitments, but rather delivery on the ones we have \r\nalready entered into. Those important messages will \r\nguide our work in the period ahead. \r\n Let me turn now to the situation in the Middle \r\nEast. The first Irish peacekeepers 50 years ago were \r\ndeployed to serve with the United Nations mission in \r\nLebanon. It is therefore a particular source of sadness \r\nto me that, despite the great efforts that have been \r\nmade down the years, we do not yet have lasting peace \r\nin the Middle East, especially between the Palestinian \r\npeople and Israel. \r\n I commend the efforts of all of those who are \r\nprepared to take the political risks necessary to turn \r\nthat situation around. In particular, I welcome and \r\nsupport the dialogue that President Abbas and Prime \r\nMinister Olmert have engaged in under the auspices of \r\nthe Annapolis process. I hope that what they have \r\nachieved together in their talks can be built upon in the \r\nimmediate period ahead, and that it will result in what \r\nwe all wish to see — a just agreement, a lasting peace \r\nand a more prosperous future for their people. \r\n Improving conditions on the ground in the \r\nPalestinian territories, including, very importantly, the \r\neconomic and social situation, would, I believe, make a \r\nsignificant and critical contribution to creating the right \r\ncontext for talks to succeed. In that regard, I have \r\ncalled many times for an end to the construction of \r\nillegal settlements not only because it is right to do so, \r\nbut also because it would send a strong and welcome \r\nsignal of good faith at a difficult and uncertain time. \r\nIsrael needs urgently to listen to the voice — the \r\nconcerned voice — of the international community on \r\nthe settlement issue. \r\n The situation in the Sudan and the tragic \r\nsuffering of the people of Darfur urgently demand our \r\nattention. I strongly urge the Sudanese Government \r\nand the rebel groups to return to the negotiating table \r\nand to engage seriously with Chief Mediator Bassolé. \r\nThe African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur must be allowed to deploy fully and speedily, \r\nand a secure environment must be created to allow the \r\nhumanitarian community to carry out its important \r\nwork. A culture of impunity cannot prevail. Those \r\nresponsible for human rights abuses in Darfur must be \r\nbrought to justice. The Government in Khartoum must \r\nface up to its responsibilities to protect its citizens, to \r\nprovide security and to ensure justice is done. \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 4 \r\n \r\n In Zimbabwe, the recent agreement to form a \r\npower-sharing Government is a moment of opportunity \r\nthat must be seized. The people of Zimbabwe, who \r\nhave suffered for far too long, deserve a new beginning \r\nand look to their leaders to provide it. Their leaders \r\nmust not be found wanting. I look forward to the \r\ndelivery of genuine power-sharing, of real political and \r\neconomic reform and of the creation of a more open \r\nand free society. \r\n In Burma, we continue to stand with the people in \r\ntheir demand for greater democracy and human rights, \r\nand we renew in particular our call for the immediate \r\nrelease of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow political \r\nprisoners. It is gravely disappointing that the ruling \r\nmilitary junta has not engaged seriously with the good \r\noffices mission of the Secretary-General, or responded \r\nin any meaningful way to the concerns of the \r\ninternational community. International pressure must \r\nbe maintained on Burma’s leaders, including, and in \r\nparticular, by the countries of the region. \r\n Ireland has watched with great distress the recent \r\nconflict in Georgia, including the evidence of the use \r\nof cluster munitions against civilian populations. We \r\nwarmly applaud President Sarkozy and the French \r\npresidency of the European Union for their efforts to \r\nsecure a settlement. The European Union is deploying \r\na monitoring mission to Georgia to work alongside \r\nUnited Nations observers, to which Ireland is proud to \r\nbe contributing. We now need to see the full honouring \r\nof commitments entered into, including the full \r\nwithdrawal of military forces by early October. I also \r\nurge Russia and Georgia to engage constructively and \r\nin good faith in the discussions scheduled to begin in \r\nGeneva on 15 October. \r\n In closing, I would like to return to where I began \r\ntoday. As Ireland’s Foreign Minister, I come here to \r\nreaffirm our strong attachment and loyalty to the \r\nUnited Nations. Whether we wish it or not, we are \r\nbeing united every day more and more by the common \r\nchallenges we all face. The principles and the work of \r\nthe United Nations have never been needed more. Its \r\nprinciples give us a firm foundation. Continuing \r\nreform will give us even stronger tools. What remains \r\nto be proven is our collective will to use them. \r\n The vision shared by all our peoples of a peaceful \r\nand secure world, with justice, human rights and \r\ndignity for all, can be realized only in cooperation with \r\nothers of like mind. For Ireland’s part, we are \r\ndetermined not to be a passive member of that formal \r\ncommunity of nations. \r\n With the support and the help of others, the \r\nfoundations of a future of peace have, as I have \r\nreported, been laid on the island of Ireland. We are now \r\ndetermined to honour that debt and continue a long \r\ntradition of active engagement in the world by \r\ncontributing our energy and our initiative where we can \r\nmake a difference. It is only through such a \r\ncommitment by each of us and through this body that \r\nwe can make the international community more than \r\nthe sum of its parts, more than the sum of its fears, and \r\ninstead make it what it was meant to be when the \r\nUnited Nations was established — the sum of all our \r\nhopes. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Seyoum Mesfin, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nEthiopia. \r\n Mr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): I should like to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the \r\npresidency and wishing you every success in the \r\nmonths ahead. I pledge my country’s fullest \r\ncooperation and support in the discharge of your duties \r\nand responsibilities. I must also extend my sincere \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\neffective leadership in promoting global peace, security \r\nand development. \r\n Last year, this Assembly declared and honoured \r\nthe opening of Ethiopia’s third millennium. We \r\nappreciate that honour. It provided a tangible \r\nfoundation for the renaissance of Ethiopia, most \r\nrecently symbolized by the re-erection of the Obelisk \r\nof Axum, brought back from Italy to the land of its \r\norigin, where it was carved 17 centuries ago. We are \r\ngrateful to the Italian Government for that right and \r\nbold decision. \r\n A central element of our millennium celebrations \r\nhas been the initiation of numerous development \r\nactivities for the war on poverty and our commitment \r\nto attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nAs the Secretary-General has noted, progress towards \r\nthe MDGs in Africa has been uneven. It is indeed \r\nalarming that no country is likely to reach all the \r\nMDGs by 2015. We are at the moment at the midway \r\nmark and we all recognize that we are behind schedule. \r\nWe hope that the high-level event on the MDGs has \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n5 08-53141 \r\n \r\nachieved its objective of creating global awareness and \r\nrenewed commitment, with particular focus on Africa. \r\n I concur with the Secretary-General that we are \r\nfacing a development emergency. In that regard, \r\ndecisive and timely action must be taken by developed \r\nand developing countries alike to live up to their \r\ncommitments to the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nFood insecurity could undermine core democratic \r\nvalues and ruin national development efforts. \r\nGovernments should therefore take the lead and work \r\ntogether in the economic sector to resolve the current \r\nglobal food crisis. \r\n The Monterrey Consensus on financing for \r\ndevelopment, integrating aid, debt relief, market \r\naccess, good governance and foreign direct investment \r\nis a litmus test for the success of global partnerships. \r\nWe call on the developed countries to honour their \r\ncommitment to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross \r\nnational income to overseas development assistance. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals provide the \r\ncritical minimum for our survival as a nation and the \r\nbasis for the profound transformation in which we are \r\ncurrently engaged. Ethiopia’s priorities remain the \r\neradication of poverty, sustainable development and \r\nensuring good governance, democracy and respect for \r\nhuman rights. Those are not a choice, but a necessity \r\nfor our survival as a nation. We have laid the \r\nfoundations for continued growth and democratization, \r\nbuilding democratic institutions from the grass roots \r\nand providing the necessary political space for \r\nresponsible democratization. \r\n Our average of 10 per cent growth over the last \r\nfive years is continuing despite the setbacks of recent \r\nmonths. We continue protecting poverty-targeted \r\noutlays and increasing capital expenditure on \r\ninfrastructure, education, health and pro-poor sectors. \r\nFor the first time in its history, Ethiopia is making real \r\nand meaningful economic progress. It is the fastest \r\ngrowing non-oil economy in Africa. \r\n Ethiopia is both landlocked and one of the least \r\ndeveloped countries. Accordingly, we attach great \r\nimportance to the full implementation of both the \r\nBrussels and the Almaty Programmes of Action. While \r\nwe appreciate all external assistance, we are equally \r\nconscious of the need for predictable, strong and \r\nenduring partnerships for mutual benefit. We need \r\neconomic relations that no longer penalize poor \r\ncountries and ones that provide greater flexibility in \r\ndevelopment aid, the transfer of capital and the \r\nremoval of excessive indebtedness. \r\n The objectives of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals make it clear that global affluence and welfare \r\nare inseparable and that prosperity cannot coexist with \r\nabject poverty. In the context of the present world \r\ntrading system, we urge realistic preferential terms of \r\ntrade, especially to least developed countries, including \r\nquota- and duty-free market access for all their goods \r\nand services. \r\n Ethiopia has consistently helped to promote peace \r\nand stability in our region. We have no doubt that \r\nsustainable development will be possible only with \r\ndurable peace and security. Those form the very \r\nfoundation of our subregional organization, the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). \r\nAs the current Chair of IGAD, Ethiopia is determined \r\nto ensure that its revitalization will become a reality, \r\nenhance regional integration and promote peace, \r\nsecurity and development. \r\n We know the dangers of continued conflict in our \r\nregion. That is indeed why we have committed \r\nourselves to peace in Somalia ever since we helped \r\norganize the first broad-based peace conference in \r\n1992. We have consistently supported all efforts to \r\nbring about an effective Government in that country. In \r\nthat regard, we are encouraged by the latest positive \r\npolitical developments in Somalia. The Djibouti \r\nAgreement and the Addis Ababa road map open the \r\nway for further progress in the peace process. We now \r\nlook forward to the planned IGAD summit in Nairobi \r\nearly next month to help Somalia’s leaders do more for \r\nnational reconciliation. \r\n At the same time, we urge the Security Council to \r\ndischarge its responsibility by deploying a \r\npeacekeeping mission to Somalia as soon as possible or \r\nat least by allocating the necessary resources to \r\nstrengthen the African Union Mission to Somalia \r\n(AMISOM). We commend the deployment of troops \r\nfrom Uganda and Burundi to AMISOM. It is never too \r\nlate for others to follow their example. \r\n Ethiopia appreciates the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement in the Sudan. We urge the parties to do \r\nmore in overcoming the challenges facing them. \r\nHowever, we must emphasize that the international \r\ncommunity should also bear its shared responsibility in \r\nthat regard. Ethiopia fully supports the African Union \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 6 \r\n \r\nposition on Darfur and the handling of the International \r\nCriminal Court-Sudan issue. \r\n Ethiopia stands firmly committed to resolving all \r\noutstanding issues with Eritrea through peaceful, \r\npolitical, legal and diplomatic means. \r\n Terrorism is a scourge that impedes peace and \r\ndevelopment in any part of the world. As its occurrence \r\nin any form threatens global security as a whole, \r\nEthiopia believes that it should be addressed \r\ncollectively. In that regard, we attach great significance \r\nto the ability of dialogue among civilizations to build a \r\nculture of tolerance that will enable us to create closer \r\nunderstanding among nations — all nations. \r\n Ethiopia remains committed to the United \r\nNations reform process and its revitalization. They are \r\ncritical to the credibility of the United Nations and the \r\nfuture of multilateralism. As a founding Member of the \r\nUnited Nations, Ethiopia will always remain loyal to \r\nits purpose and principles. \r\n The United Nations is the custodian of \r\nmultilateral diplomacy. At no time since the Second \r\nWorld War have multilateralism and genuine \r\ncooperation been as critical as they are today. That is \r\nwhy we need the United Nations as never before. It is a \r\nbody that remains vital to the future of us all, \r\ndeveloping and developed countries alike. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wilfred Elrington, Attorney \r\nGeneral and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign \r\nTrade of Belize. \r\n Mr. Elrington (Belize): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Belize, I congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-third session. It is a \r\ndistinct honour for all Central American and Caribbean \r\npeoples. I assure you of Belize’s fullest support during \r\nyour term of office. \r\n I would also wish to thank your predecessor, \r\nSrgjan Kerim, for the sterling manner in which he \r\npresided over the sixty-second session. I also wish to \r\npay tribute to our very capable Secretary-General, who \r\nworks so assiduously to discharge the multifaceted \r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations. \r\n Belize accepts with pride and humility the \r\ninvitation so kindly extended to us to share our vision \r\nof how we should address the great challenges of the \r\nday and how we can achieve the unity we need in order \r\nto do so effectively. \r\n Being a very small State in a world that has long \r\nbeen characterized by greed, indifference, arrogance, \r\napathy, selfishness and myopia, Belize is no stranger to \r\ncrises. In our evolution from colonialism to \r\nindependence, we have had far more than our fair share \r\nof them and we survived them all. \r\n Thus, while we join in the consensus, so \r\nforcefully articulated over the past week, that never has \r\nthere been a time in the recorded history of humankind \r\nthat the world has been beset at one and the same time \r\nby so many crises of potentially catastrophic \r\nproportions as it is today, we remain convinced that the \r\nsolution to those crises is not beyond the collective \r\nwisdom of humankind. On the contrary, we are \r\nconvinced that our world leaders, who gathered within \r\nthese hallowed walls this past week, possess the moral, \r\nintellectual and financial capacities to overcome the \r\npresent challenges and to secure the future of our \r\nplanet Earth and of all who dwell upon it. We therefore \r\nlook to the future with optimism. \r\n My Government believes that there are a number \r\nof preconditions that must be satisfied before we can \r\nhope to successfully combat the challenges we face. \r\nThe first is the acceptance by all peoples that we are \r\nour brothers’ keeper and that, as you, Sir, so poignantly \r\nstated, “either we treat each other as brothers and \r\nsisters or we witness the beginning of the end of our \r\nhuman species” (A/63/PV.5, p. 5). \r\n The second and equally important precondition is \r\nthe acceptance by all peoples that we are heirs to and \r\nowners of the Earth and of all the resources thereon \r\nand that no individual race or nation has a greater \r\nclaim to them than anyone else. And the third and \r\nperhaps most important precondition of all is the \r\nacceptance by all peoples that our planet as we know it \r\nis not indestructible, that it can be mortally damaged, if \r\nnot destroyed, by what we do to it, and that none of us \r\nwould escape the consequences of such a tragic turn of \r\nevents. \r\n The experience of our own country, Belize, bears \r\nout the fact that the treatment we mete out to each \r\nother determines to a large extent our own destinies. \r\nThe hardships and deprivations which Belizeans \r\nsuffered in the past and continue to suffer even today \r\nhave been caused in large part not by nature dealing us \r\na bad hand but by the human exploitation and \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n7 08-53141 \r\n \r\nselfishness of which we are the victims. Nature itself \r\nhas been bountiful to us — so much so that our \r\nnational poet, Samuel Haynes, who penned the lyrics \r\nof our national anthem, was moved to begin one of the \r\nstanzas with the following line, “Nature has blessed us \r\nwith wealth untold”. \r\n Yet with all our abundant natural resources, it is \r\nvery doubtful whether we will, despite our best efforts, \r\nbe able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby the year 2015. We are not in a position to say today \r\nwith any degree of certainty that by 2015 all the \r\nchildren in our country, boys and girls alike, will \r\ncomplete publicly funded primary education. Nor can \r\nwe forecast that by 2015 we will attain gender equality, \r\nreduce childhood mortality by two thirds and maternal \r\nmortality by three quarters, and reverse the spread of \r\nHIV/AIDS and other diseases. \r\n The truth is that small countries like ours are not \r\nthe masters of our own destinies. We are severely \r\nconstrained in what we can do to advance our own \r\ndevelopment agendas because we simply do not \r\npossess and cannot readily access the human, financial \r\nor technological resources needed to develop our \r\npeople and to secure our futures. And given the \r\npredatory nature of the world we live in today, we will \r\nnever be able to attain those resources using our own \r\ndevices. We will most certainly need the assistance of \r\nthe international community. We live in an \r\ninterdependent world. \r\n While the developed countries may possess all \r\nthe human, financial and technological resources we \r\nlack, the crises which now confront us are making it \r\nmanifest that not even the richest and most powerful of \r\nthem can successfully withstand and combat the \r\ncatastrophic consequences of nature’s fury and man’s \r\nexcesses by relying on their own devices and \r\nresources. They must join forces with the rest of the \r\nworld. That imperative was articulated by Mr. Gordon \r\nBrown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, on \r\n26 September in this very Hall (see A/63/PV.11) when \r\nhe stated, in essence, that every global problem \r\nrequires global solutions, that we cannot solve the food \r\ncrisis, climate change and the pressures on resources \r\nwithout involving Africa and the developing countries, \r\nand that Africa and the developing countries are not the \r\nproblem but part of the very solution to today’s \r\nproblems. \r\n What Gordon Brown speaks to and what many of \r\nthe leaders in this general debate have highlighted is \r\nthe global leadership challenge we face. In addressing \r\nthat challenge, we would propose that we first examine \r\nhow our multilateral institutions function. Joseph \r\nStiglitz in his book Making Globalization Work wrote \r\nthat: \r\n “The nation-state, which has been the center of \r\npolitical and ... economic power for the past \r\ncentury and a half is being squeezed today — on \r\none side by the forces of global economics, and \r\non the other side by political demands for \r\ndevolution of power. Globalization — the closer \r\nintegration of the countries of the world — has \r\nresulted in the need for more collective action, \r\nfor people and countries to act together to solve \r\ntheir common problems.” \r\nStiglitz continued that \r\n “while the nation-state has been weakened, there \r\nhas yet to be created at the international level the \r\nkinds of democratic global institutions that can \r\ndeal effectively with the problems globalization \r\nhas created.” \r\n There is no disputing that the interests of the \r\ndeveloping countries are poorly represented and dealt \r\nwith in the present global institutions. That is clearly \r\nmanifested in the multilateral trade and financial \r\ninstitutions, where negotiations are closeted in green \r\nrooms and where the fundamental democratic principle \r\nof one vote per country is subverted in a system that \r\ndetermines voting rights based on economic power. If \r\nthe developing countries are to become developed, it \r\nwill be imperative to revisit those structures and \r\ntransform them into institutions that are representative, \r\ntransparent and democratic. \r\n In addition to the systemic issues that must be \r\naddressed, we must also tackle the crisis of \r\nimplementation. If we consider the numerous \r\nconferences and summits that have been convened to \r\ncraft global responses to development, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, financing for development, trade, climate \r\nchange and more recently the food crisis, there is no \r\nwant of commitments and common objectives. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals promised to \r\nthe world’s peoples that we would take concerted \r\naction to improve the quality of their lives. The \r\nMonterrey Consensus promised a new global \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 8 \r\n \r\npartnership that would support those efforts to \r\neradicate poverty and promote sustainable economic \r\ngrowth and development. The Doha Ministerial \r\nDeclaration promised to put the needs and interests of \r\nthe developing countries at the heart of its work \r\nprogramme. \r\n But we know from the reports that our progress \r\ntowards the realization of the MDGs has been slow and \r\nuneven that the realization of the Monterrey \r\ncommitments has been dismal particularly on the part \r\nof developed countries and the international financial \r\nand trade institutions, and that the Doha Development \r\nRound has collapsed. Indeed, were these commitments \r\nnot set down on paper, one might question their very \r\nexistence. \r\n We also know that the failure of the full \r\nimplementation of our global commitments is not for \r\nwant of resources but for want of compassion and \r\nempathy. Globalization may have forced the world into \r\na closer relationship, but at the political level it has not \r\nmanaged to calibrate national interests vis-à-vis global \r\ninterests. We therefore still act only when it is in our \r\nnarrow self-interest to do so. \r\n However, the current crises are signalling clearly \r\nthat we can no longer subsume the global interests \r\nunder our own. The challenges we face clearly \r\ndemonstrate how our fates are intertwined. As leaders, \r\nwe must start now, with a sense of urgency, to take the \r\nnecessary action to deliver on the promises of \r\ndevelopment. More importantly, we must commit to \r\nsubmitting our actions to international oversight. \r\n The United Nations must play the pivotal role in \r\naddressing the global leadership crisis. Belize holds the \r\nview that the way forward is for the United Nations to \r\nconcentrate its efforts on convincing the leaders and \r\npeoples of the developed world that the security, \r\ndevelopment and well-being of all peoples of the world \r\nafford the best guarantee for their own security, safety \r\nand development and ultimately their very survival. It \r\nis our conviction that the adoption of that view by the \r\ndeveloped world would prove to be the catalyst for \r\nachieving the unity that the world now needs to be able \r\nto address successfully the challenges of our day. \r\n To that end, the United Nations must be \r\nstrengthened so as better to serve to monitor the \r\nimplementation of the globally agreed commitments. \r\nIts universality must be reinforced with the \r\nparticipation of all relevant stakeholders in its \r\nelaboration of responses to our threats and challenges. \r\nIn that regard, my Government wholeheartedly \r\nsupports the participation of the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan in the United Nations specialized agencies. \r\nFinally, its decisions must carry the full weight that \r\nimpels action. \r\n The United Nations still represents the great hope \r\nfor all our peoples. The principles upon which it was \r\nfounded and the objectives for which it was formed are \r\nno less relevant today than they were in 1945. For my \r\nown country, our membership in the United Nations \r\nsecured the hope of peace, security and development, \r\neven as we continue to struggle with a long-extant \r\nclaim to our territory. It provides the framework within \r\nwhich we can peacefully settle our differences. Today, \r\nthe Governments of Belize and Guatemala have an \r\nopportunity finally to settle that dispute by juridical \r\nmeans, specifically through referral to the International \r\nCourt of Justice (ICJ). We have reached a major \r\nstepping stone, but we are not deluded by the \r\nchallenges ahead. Not only must we negotiate a \r\ncompromise for the referral of the matter, but the \r\nquestion of taking the claim to the ICJ must be put to \r\nnational referendums in both countries. The road to the \r\nICJ and the final resolution of the territorial difference \r\nwill undoubtedly have many high tolls. Belize appeals \r\nto the international community through the United \r\nNations for its continued solidarity and support. \r\n Sixty years ago when we adopted the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, humanity had been \r\nwrested from the throes of war. The Declaration \r\nconfirmed in article 1 that \r\n “All human beings are born free and equal in \r\ndignity and rights. They are endowed with reason \r\nand conscience and should act towards one \r\nanother in a spirit of brotherhood.” \r\nThe global conscience was awakened and alerted, \r\nbecause our forebears knew that continued disregard \r\nand contempt for human rights and freedoms would \r\nlead to barbarous acts between peoples and nations. \r\nThey foresaw the advent of a world in which human \r\nbeings would enjoy freedom of speech and belief and \r\nfreedom from fear and want, and proclaimed those \r\nfreedoms as the highest aspirations of the common \r\npeople. \r\n My Government holds an unflinching \r\ncommitment to those values and aspirations. We are \r\nstill soldiers in the battle for freedom, equality and \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n9 08-53141 \r\n \r\njustice, but in fighting that battle we no longer need the \r\ncrude instruments of war. Instead, we have as our \r\nweapon the power of the rule of law, cooperation and \r\nfriendship between peoples and nations and an abiding \r\nfaith in multilateralism. Let us be so guided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ojo Maduekwe, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. \r\n Mr. Maduekwe (Nigeria): I congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, on your election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. You may \r\nremain assured of the full support and cooperation of \r\nthe Nigerian delegation as you guide our deliberations. \r\nMay I also express appreciation to your predecessor for \r\nthe able manner in which he presided over the work of \r\nthe Assembly’s sixty-second session. \r\n In his address to this Assembly last year (see \r\nA/62/PV.7), the Nigerian President reaffirmed the \r\ndetermination of Nigeria to remain a stable and \r\nprosperous nation, anchored on the enduring principles \r\nof democracy, good governance, free enterprise, the \r\nrule of law and respect for fundamental human rights. \r\nIn pursuit of those objectives, we have raised the bar \r\non bold political, economic and social reforms aimed at \r\nmaking our economy more investment friendly and our \r\ndemocracy more inclusive. We continue to count on the \r\nsupport and understanding of the international \r\ncommunity, especially our development partners, as we \r\naccelerate measures to enhance the overall capacity of \r\nthe Nigerian State. \r\n A strong, safe and prosperous Nigeria means a \r\ndependable contributor not only to regional stability \r\nand well-being, but to the emergent global ethics so \r\ncrucial for the survival of humanity. From the very \r\nbeginning of our nationhood, our foreign policy has \r\nbeen tethered to a responsible and proactive role in the \r\nUnited Nations and its commitments everywhere. Thus, \r\nwe never hesitated to respond unconditionally to \r\ndemands for sacrifices whenever and wherever duty \r\ncalled, whether in the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia or \r\nnow in Darfur, and in the next few months, in Somalia. \r\nNigeria is as safe as the rest of the world. That for us is \r\nthe true meaning of global solidarity and the sense of \r\nequal partnership that informed the vision of the \r\nfounding fathers of this Organization. \r\n It is against that background that we raise before \r\nthe Assembly the concern and plight of many \r\ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa, suffering \r\nfrom the devastating consequences of the illicit trade in \r\nsmall arms and light weapons. Most of the civil wars \r\nand insurgencies in those countries have been carried \r\nout with such weapons, and because of their lethality \r\nand ready deployment, they may be described as \r\nAfrica’s own experience of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\n We remain convinced that the best and most \r\neffective strategy to achieve the goal of preventing, \r\ncombating and eradicating that illicit and deadly trade \r\nis through the elaboration of a legally binding global \r\ninstrument, as well as the political will on the part of \r\nall to stem the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms. \r\nTherefore, urgent action is needed to criminalize oil \r\nbunkering, the sale of oil so acquired and the use of its \r\nproceeds to fuel new crisis situations in Africa, \r\nespecially in the Gulf of Guinea, through the \r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons. The \r\nsame creativity and political will that was \r\ndemonstrated in confronting blood diamonds as a \r\nsource of regional instability must be available at this \r\ntime in dealing with the blood oil that now threatens \r\nthe Gulf. \r\n Nigeria has made enormous sacrifices on behalf \r\nof peace in Darfur. Over the years we have maintained \r\npeacekeeping troops in the region, first, under the \r\nambit of the African Union and now under the African \r\nUnion-United Nations hybrid peacekeeping force. We \r\ncall on the international community to take bold and \r\nrobust steps that would lead to the full deployment and \r\noperationalization of that force. In the same vein, we \r\ncall on the Government of the Sudan to take steps that \r\nwill facilitate the attainment of this objective. \r\n Midway towards the target year of 2015, it has \r\nbecome evident that the lofty Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) might not be attained by many \r\ncountries. This much is clear from the outcome of the \r\nHigh-level event on the MDGs that took place in the \r\nmargins of this session on 25 September 2008. Mindful \r\nof the importance of these Goals for our development, \r\nNigeria is determined to do everything to ensure their \r\nrealization. In this connection, we commend the efforts \r\nof the Secretary-General in creating the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Africa Steering Group to map out \r\nstrategies for African countries to achieve the targets. \r\n It is time to urge, with the directness that these \r\nchallenging times demand, evidence of a more \r\nmanifest will on the part of the international \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 10 \r\n \r\ncommunity, especially our development partners, to \r\nreally assist Africa to join the rest of the global success \r\nstory. Around this issue, the Nigerian delegation is \r\nlooking at ten such indicators. \r\n The first is the critical need for a big \r\ninfrastructure push, especially in energy and \r\ntransportation, without which nothing else is possible \r\non the continent. Secondly, the food crisis in Africa \r\nmust be addressed by redressing the trilogy of fertilizer \r\nimbalance between Africa and other regions of the \r\nworld, removing food subsides in the developed \r\neconomies, and transferring relevant technology for \r\nfood production and food processing. Thirdly, the Doha \r\nRound of trade negotiations must be revived. Fourthly, \r\nmassive investment in information technology and \r\nhigher education is needed to spur development of \r\nAfrica. Fifthly, strategies must be devised with African \r\nGovernments on how to transform the continent’s \r\ncurrent brain drain into brain gain. Sixthly, a global \r\ncommitment to stem the flow of small arms and light \r\nweapons into Africa is needed. Seventh, national \r\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative projects \r\nin Africa must be encouraged and supported. Eighth, \r\nthere should be Security Council reforms that accord \r\nAfrica permanent membership in the Council. That \r\nwould ensure African ownership of its responses, since \r\nover 60 per cent of issues addressed by the Council are \r\nAfrican. Ninth, attention should be paid to \r\ndevelopment of clean energy technology and \r\nalternative sources of energy to avert the looming \r\ndisaster of climate change for a continent that is \r\nalready very vulnerable. Tenth, we need a breakthrough \r\nin the malaria vaccine, together with greater sustained \r\nsupport for the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \r\ntwo major impediments to reaching our potential in \r\nAfrica. \r\n The recent steep rise in global food prices has \r\npresented us with a monumental challenge and the \r\nglobal embarrassment of compounds of misery sharing \r\nincreasingly crowded space with compounds of \r\naffluence in our global village. It is unacceptable that, \r\ndespite technological advancements and resources \r\nunimaginable two decades ago, children still die of \r\nhunger and malnutrition. How can one say that the \r\ngenius that permits us to make living in outer space \r\nfeasible looks the other way when over 1 billion people \r\nin the world are going to bed hungry and more than \r\n6 million children are dying each year of hunger and \r\nmalnutrition? This problem deserves the full attention \r\nof this Assembly. The right to food for all must be \r\npursued with renewed vigour. \r\n Nigeria condemns terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. We reaffirm our support for the \r\ncounter-terrorism measures of the Security Council and \r\nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \r\nWe have also been implementing the four pillars of the \r\nGlobal Strategy through measures that have proven \r\neffective in combating terrorism. For us, the fight \r\nagainst terrorism is strongly anchored in the rule of law \r\nand respect for human rights. As we combat this \r\nscourge, it is important that, fundamental freedoms and \r\nhuman rights are neither compromised nor abused. \r\n The United Nations must not relent in its pursuit \r\nof the goal of a world in which all nations and peoples \r\nlive in freedom and dignity and in which all political, \r\neconomic, social, cultural and human rights are fully \r\nguaranteed. Our active participation in the activities of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the African \r\nCommission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is \r\nevidence of that commitment. \r\n In our subregion, we are concerned, that drug \r\ncartels, often based outside the region, are now \r\ntargeting West Africa as a transit route for the \r\nmovement of illicit drugs to other regions. The \r\nactivities of those drug cartels constitute a serious \r\nimpediment to development in the subregion. The \r\nworld must pay adequate attention to this growing \r\nproblem. \r\n Let me reiterate Nigeria’s unwavering support for \r\nthe United Nations and its objectives and purposes. We \r\nare convinced that the Organization remains the most \r\nviable platform for consultations, consensus-building \r\nand action on the global challenges that we presently \r\nface. Mankind has not developed any better substitute. \r\n Nigeria believes in the pacific settlement of \r\ndisputes and peaceful coexistence with our neighbours. \r\nWe showed that when, on 14 August 2008, Nigeria, in \r\nfull compliance with the ruling of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, lowered its flag for the last time by \r\nwithdrawing from the Bakassi Peninsula. For that \r\nsingular act of statesmanship, Nigeria has justifiably \r\nreceived the commendation of the international \r\ncommunity. Our action accords with our long-standing \r\ntradition as a nation that honours its commitments. We \r\nbelieve that if we all, in concert, stand up for these \r\nshared values and purposes, our Organization and our \r\nworld will be a much better place. \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n11 08-53141 \r\n \r\n This can, and should be a General Assembly like \r\nno other, for the crises that face us now have few \r\nprecedents in scope and complexity. What is required \r\nis a new posture to move from data to determination, \r\nfrom rhetoric to results and from words to wisdom. Our \r\nmany noble visions must begin to somehow find more \r\nvigorous forms of expression. A world so greatly \r\nchallenged must also be a world so much more capable \r\nof imagination and boldness. The platform for such \r\nboldness and such imagination is here, in this \r\nvenerable institution founded 63 years ago on the \r\npillars of peace, justice and freedom for all. \r\n Let us never forget the timeless words of the \r\ninternationalist and Nobel Laureate who warned that to \r\ndeal with the problems that we have created, we need \r\nto move unto a higher order of thinking than the one \r\nwith which we created them. The time to do so is now, \r\nfor the clock of humanity is ticking very fast. Our \r\nexistential challenge did not end with the cold war; \r\nindeed, it has just started.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Republic of South \r\nAfrica. \r\n Ms. Dlamini Zuma (South Africa): My \r\ndelegation and I join in expressing our congratulations \r\nto you, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session, and we hope you have a very \r\nsuccessful and rewarding term at the helm of this body. \r\nWe express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim for the excellent work done during his tenure as \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-second session.  \r\n Once again, we have come to this body to \r\nreaffirm the need for what we have always called for: \r\nthe implementation of all the promises and pledges that \r\nwe have made before. The focus of the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly is on the global food \r\ncrisis, climate change and reform of the United \r\nNations. The confluence of the food, fuel and financial \r\ncrises, as well as the effects of climate change, pose the \r\nreal threat that they will undermine the progress made \r\nby developing countries in the struggle against poverty \r\nand underdevelopment. \r\n During the Millennium Summit, held in 2000, our \r\nheads of State and Government adopted a Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) that communicated a message of hope \r\nand a vision of a better world. Included in the \r\nDeclaration was an important section on the special \r\nneeds of Africa. In paragraph 24 of the Declaration, the \r\nleaders stated that they would  \r\n“spare no effort to promote democracy and \r\nstrengthen the rule of law, as well as respect for \r\nall internationally recognized human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, including the right to \r\ndevelopment”.  \r\n African and many other, developing countries \r\nhave indeed taken responsibility for promoting \r\ndemocracy, good governance, peace and stability and \r\nhuman rights. They are also hard at work rolling back \r\nthe frontiers of poverty and underdevelopment. But, \r\ndespite those strides, it is clear that many in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa will not achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Part of the reason is that \r\nthe global partnership for development on which the \r\nachievement of the MDGs was predicated has not been \r\nfully implemented. Despite the lofty ideas expressed at \r\nprevious sessions of the Assembly, we continue to fall \r\nshort in meeting our commitments to implement that \r\npartnership, in particular in the areas of trade, aid and \r\ndebt relief.  \r\n We express the fervent hope that the high-level \r\nmeetings organized by yourself, Mr. President, and the \r\nSecretary-General, on Africa’s development needs and \r\non the MDGs, have served not only as important \r\nreminders of the challenges we face, but also as a \r\ncatalyst that will cause the world to feel a greater sense \r\nof urgency. \r\n The necessary resources exist in the world to \r\nachieve the MDGs. We need to summon the necessary \r\npolitical will and compassion. So we join the sister \r\ncountries of our continent in calling for massive \r\nresource transfers through development assistance, \r\ninvestment, trade, technology transfers and human \r\nresource development. These will ensure that African \r\nand other developing countries are able to successfully \r\nadapt to the devastating impact of climate change and \r\nachieve the MDGs. \r\n However, in order to accelerate the achievement \r\nof all the Millennium Development Goals, much more \r\nattention needs to be focused on Goal 3, regarding the \r\nempowerment of women. Women need to be at the \r\ncentre of development as agents of change, socially, \r\neconomically and politically.  \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 12 \r\n \r\n Billions of the people of the world, whom we are \r\nprivileged to represent in the Assembly, have cast their \r\neyes on this gathering of leaders. They have done so \r\nbecause they have hope that this leadership will take \r\nthe required measures in order to address poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. We dare not fail them. \r\n The food crisis has to be addressed in the short \r\nand medium terms. The Green Revolution that has \r\nbeen launched by the African Union needs partnerships \r\nin order to succeed. In addition, support for the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development will be a major \r\ncontributor to the struggle against poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. In that context, allow me, Mr. \r\nPresident, to quote from your own statement to the \r\nGeneral Assembly with regard to that socio-economic \r\nprogramme as well as the role of our immediate former \r\nPresident, Thabo Mbeki:  \r\n“During his presidency of the rainbow nation, \r\nspanning nearly a decade, he, along [with] other \r\nAfrican leaders, championed the vision of \r\nNEPAD we still pursue today. When the affluent \r\nlisten to Africa and partner with it, that vision is \r\nwithin reach. To quote NEPAD’s founding \r\ndocument: `In fulfilling its promise, this agenda \r\nmust give hope to the emaciated African child \r\nthat the twenty-first century is indeed Africa’s \r\ncentury.’” (A/63/PV.4, p. 3)  \r\n The Doha Development Round has stalled despite \r\nseven years of negotiations. We are convinced that \r\ntrade and increased market access will make a major \r\ncontribution to the achievement of the MDGs. In that \r\nregard, it is our submission that the Doha Round of \r\ntrade negotiations should not be allowed to die, but \r\nmust remain focused on development, as originally \r\nenvisaged.  \r\n In recent years, we have all witnessed the \r\ndevastating effects of climate change, especially on \r\nisland States. Hurricanes have become more frequent \r\nand more vicious, together with droughts, floods and \r\nunpredictable extreme weather patterns in the rest of \r\nthe world. Of course, climate change requires an urgent \r\nresponse. Given the agreement in Bali last year on a \r\nroad map for negotiations, it is our hope that the \r\nnegotiations, to be completed in Copenhagen in 2009, \r\nwill necessarily set the stage for more concerted action \r\nby all countries to address climate change and all its \r\nmanifestations, with the developed countries taking the \r\nlead. South Africa commits itself to approaching the \r\npreparations for Copenhagen constructively and with a \r\nview to reaching an agreement that is ambitious, \r\nbalanced and inclusive. \r\n We join the many leaders of the world who have \r\nexpressed their support for fundamental reform of the \r\nsystem of global governance, including the United \r\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions. It is \r\nimportant to understand that the critical issues facing \r\nthe world today — the current financial, food and \r\nenergy crises — cannot be addressed effectively when \r\nso many countries and regions of the world are left out \r\nof the key decision-making processes of important \r\ninstitutions of global governance. South Africa stands \r\nready to work with other members of the United \r\nNations to advance the goal of reform.  \r\n Equally, the reform of the Security Council need \r\nnot be re-emphasized. We reiterate our view that a \r\nreformed Security Council would have more legitimacy \r\nand that its decisions would have more credibility. We \r\nwelcome the recent decision (decision 62/557) to \r\nlaunch in the General Assembly inter-governmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform, to discuss \r\nplans for expanding the Security Council in both the \r\nnon-permanent and permanent categories. It is of \r\ncourse a travesty of justice that Africa, which \r\nconstitutes a large portion of the work of the Council, \r\nis not represented in the permanent category. Unless \r\nthe ideals of freedom, justice and equality become the \r\ncharacter of the United Nations, including the Security \r\nCouncil, the dominant will continue to dictate to the \r\ndominated, while the dreams of the dominated will \r\nforever be deferred. \r\n In December this year, my country will complete \r\nits tenure as a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil. We have indeed been privileged to serve the \r\npeoples of Africa and the world in that capacity; it has \r\nbeen a historic first for us as a young democracy. In \r\nthat capacity, we were indeed honoured to contribute \r\nmeaningfully to global efforts to create peace and \r\nstability in all regions of the world. Accordingly, we \r\nexpress the humble gratitude of the people of our \r\ncountry to the general membership of the United \r\nNations for the trust placed in us in helping the world \r\ndischarge this mandate. \r\n During our tenure, the Security Council also \r\nfocused on the important question of enhancing the \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations, in particular the African Union (AU). \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n13 08-53141 \r\n \r\nWe were honoured to be able to contribute to that \r\nwork. We congratulate the Secretary-General on \r\nappointing an African Union-United Nations panel of \r\ndistinguished persons whose mandate is to explore \r\nfinancing modalities for AU-led peacekeeping \r\nmissions. \r\n Peace continues to evade the Middle East. South \r\nAfrica participated in the Annapolis Conference in \r\n2007 with great expectations and hopes that progress \r\nwould indeed be made to advance the goal of peace in \r\nthat region. We will continue to support all \r\ninternational efforts to help the peoples of Palestine \r\nand Israel in their endeavour to find a lasting and \r\npeaceful solution to their challenges, leading to the \r\nestablishment of a viable Palestinian State, coexisting \r\nside by side with the State of Israel, within secure \r\nborders. We understand full well the pain, suffering \r\nand agony that conflict brings to bear on the lives of \r\nordinary people, particularly women and children. \r\nThose ordinary souls continue to cry out to this \r\nAssembly of the world, as they have done in the past, \r\nto help bring an end to the conflict. \r\n South Africa will continue to work with the sister \r\npeoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nBurundi and Côte d’Ivoire in their efforts to \r\nconsolidate peace and democracy in their respective \r\ncountries. With regard to Zimbabwe, the Assembly \r\nmust certainly be aware of the recent developments led \r\nby our former President Thabo Mbeki in his capacity as \r\nthe Southern African Development Community \r\n(SADC) facilitator, which culminated in the signing of \r\nan agreement between the main political protagonists \r\nin the country. We hope that the leadership of \r\nZimbabwe win soon finalize aspects of that agreement \r\nto make possible the formation of a new Government \r\nthat will help lay the groundwork to address the \r\npolitical and economic challenges facing their country. \r\nSADC, the African Union and the facilitator stand as \r\nguarantors of the agreement. We call on the \r\ninternational community to spare neither strength nor \r\neffort in lending a hand to the people of Zimbabwe as \r\nthey embark on the difficult path of reconciliation and \r\nreconstruction. \r\n Equally, the situations in Somalia and the Sudan, \r\nand especially in Darfur, remain matters of great \r\nconcern. South Africa will continue to do whatever it \r\ncan, both bilaterally and in the context of the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations, to help the peoples of \r\nSudan and Somalia find peace among themselves. \r\n We remain concerned about the impasse on the \r\nquestion of Western Sahara. South Africa is committed \r\nto seeking a just, mutually acceptable and lasting \r\nsolution to that problem.  \r\n This year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. During the past six decades, the Declaration \r\nhas remained the key standard for human rights, justice \r\nand dignity. We should therefore use this anniversary \r\nperiod to strengthen our resolve to defend human \r\nrights. South Africa has also had the honour to be \r\nreviewed under the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism of the new Human Rights Council. We \r\nwere also honoured with the appointment of our own \r\nJustice Navi Pillai to lead that very important \r\ninternational institution. \r\nMr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n We wish to reiterate our belief in the centrality of \r\nthe United Nations. In the Millennium Declaration, we \r\nreaffirmed that the United Nations “is the \r\nindispensable common house of the entire human \r\nfamily, through which we will seek to realize our \r\nuniversal aspirations for peace, cooperation and \r\ndevelopment” (resolution 55/2, para. 32). Leading \r\nSouth Africa’s delegation to the Millennium Summit \r\nwas our former President, Thabo Mbeki, who reminded \r\nthe Assembly that  \r\n“Billions among the living struggle to survive in \r\nconditions of poverty, deprivation and \r\nunderdevelopment ... as offensive to everything \r\nhumane as anything we decry about the second \r\nmillennium.” (A/55/PV.5, p. 18) \r\n It is that understanding that has correctly \r\ninformed the engagement of successive leaders of our \r\ndemocratic State with this body over the years. In that \r\nregard, we are touched and humbled by the kind \r\ncomments made in the Assembly by the various heads \r\nof State or Government and heads of delegation, \r\ndirected at our immediate former President, Thabo \r\nMbeki. We most certainly shall, through our \r\nGovernment, convey those sentiments to that noble son \r\nof our people and our continent, and citizen of the \r\nworld. \r\n Accordingly, from this rostrum may I also \r\nexpress our sincere gratitude to the general \r\nmembership of the United Nations for the support that \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 14 \r\n \r\nformer President Mbeki and our country received over \r\nthe past nine-and-a-half years of his stewardship of our \r\ncountry. As the leadership of our country is passed on, \r\nwe confirm that South Africa, under the guidance of \r\nPresident Kgalema Motlanthe, shall indeed continue to \r\nbe a trusted and dependable partner in the common \r\nendeavour to strengthen our institutions of \r\nmultilateralism, starting from the correct premise that \r\nmultilateralism remains the only hope in addressing the \r\nchallenges facing humanity today, whether they be \r\nterrorism, threats to human rights, peace and stability \r\nor, of course, the central struggle against poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Osman \r\nMohammed Saleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nEritrea. \r\n Mr. Saleh (Eritrea): I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. He has the \r\nfull support of my delegation, and I wish him every \r\nsuccess as he guides the important deliberations of the \r\nsession at this most critical time. I also wish to take \r\nthis opportunity to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, who \r\nsuccessfully presided over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session. \r\n These are turbulent times indeed. The world \r\ntoday is not getting safer by any standard. Alas, there \r\nseems to be a vortex of perennial conflicts and crises. \r\nThe fires in Afghanistan and Iraq have not been \r\nextinguished; to the contrary, they continue to \r\nsmoulder and intensify, punctuated by misleading, \r\nshort-lived lulls. The intractable conflict situations in \r\nthe Middle East are not nearer to a solution today. In \r\nSomalia, humanitarian suffering of unparalleled \r\nmagnitude continues to unfold, although it remains \r\nlargely ignored by the international media. \r\nFurthermore, the war in Georgia, with its potential \r\nfallout for global polarization is symptomatic of, and \r\nunderscores, the extremely fragile security \r\nenvironment that prevails in our troubled world today. \r\n To add to that gloomy mix, the world is also \r\nwitnessing volatile and speculative fluctuations in the \r\nprice of fuel oil, an unprecedented hike in food prices \r\nand a recent spate of insolvency of financial \r\ncorporations that in combination are driving the global \r\neconomy towards recession. Rapid climatic changes \r\nresulting from progressive environmental degradation \r\nand the resulting spell of more frequent floods and \r\ndroughts, as well as pandemics that are affecting \r\nmillions of people, complete the grid of the immense \r\nchallenges that our global community is facing today. \r\nThese multifaceted problems stem from multiple \r\ncauses.  \r\n At the same time, it cannot be denied that many \r\nof those problems have been exacerbated, if not \r\ninstigated, by the misguided and domineering policies \r\nof the United States Government. Indeed, the \r\nfingerprints of the sole super-Power are discernible in \r\nmost of the conflict situations that are raging in many \r\nparts of our globe, with the deleterious economic, \r\nfinancial and humanitarian ramifications that they \r\ninvariably entail. \r\n The perplexing feature of that overarching and \r\nnegative development is the emergence of the concept \r\nof management by crisis as a new tool of policy \r\npromotion. These days, candid efforts are not exerted \r\nto prevent and manage conflicts. On the contrary, \r\ncrises are deliberately spawned and allowed to fester \r\nand the resulting necessity for management then \r\nprovides the United States with opportunity and \r\nlatitude for control, in a situation of permanent \r\ninstability. The absence of countervailing forces in a \r\nunipolar world has only aggravated the situation. \r\nPrincipal among those is the weakness of the United \r\nNations in pursuing an independent line and acting as a \r\nbulwark of robust multilateralism. \r\n The strong misgivings that I have expressed are \r\nattested to by the multiple situations of turbulence that \r\ncontinue to unfold in our part of the world. Allow me \r\nto illustrate this grim reality through a brief description \r\nof the causes and complications of such turbulence. \r\n In the border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia, \r\nboth parties had ultimately agreed to resolve the \r\ndispute through binding arbitration on the legal basis of \r\nthe sanctity of the colonial boundaries. These are \r\ncardinal principles of international law enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter as well as in the Constitutive \r\nAct of the African Union. Furthermore, these \r\ncommitments were solemnly enshrined in the Algiers \r\nPeace Agreement that was signed by the parties in \r\nDecember 2000. The Algiers Agreement was \r\ncomprehensive in its details. Essentially, it had two \r\ncomponents: first, confidence-building provisions and \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n15 08-53141 \r\n \r\nmeasures through the deployment of a modest United \r\nNations peacekeeping force; and secondly, settlement \r\nof the border dispute through final and binding \r\narbitration on the basis of the colonial treaties and \r\ninternational law. \r\n As members know, the parties went through \r\nlengthy and meticulous legal litigation in The Hague in \r\n2001. The Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission — a \r\nfive-member arbitration panel of international \r\njurists — announced its unanimous final and binding \r\ndecision on 13 April 2002 and made serious efforts for \r\nfive years, until the completion of its work in \r\nNovember 2007. From November 2007 onwards in \r\nparticular, Ethiopia’s military presence on sovereign \r\nEritrean territories has been one of blatant occupation. \r\nThis is so because the Boundary Commission has \r\ndecided to complete its demarcation functions — \r\nwhich were disrupted and held hostage by Ethiopia for \r\nfive long years — through precise representation of the \r\nboundary by coordinates. \r\n Throughout these years, Ethiopia’s reckless acts \r\nof destabilization and aggression were supported by the \r\nUnited States, and they continue to be. Throughout \r\nthese years, the United States not only used its \r\nformidable clout in the United Nations system to \r\nforestall appropriate measures against Ethiopia \r\npursuant to the Algiers Agreement and that were based \r\non Chapter VII of the Charter, but it concocted various \r\nformulas — special envoys and extensions of the \r\nmandate of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and \r\nEritrea (UNMEE), among other things — of \r\n“management by crisis”, to perpetuate the conflict and \r\nderail enforcement of the Commission’s legal decision. \r\n The tragedy in Somalia is another extremely \r\ngrave humanitarian situation that has been exacerbated, \r\nif not brought about, essentially because of wrong \r\nUnited States policies. Half a million Somalis are today \r\ndisplaced and living in abysmal conditions mainly as a \r\nresult of Ethiopia’s military invasion in 2007. \r\nThousands of innocent civilians have been killed. \r\nUnited States warplanes occasionally pulverize Somali \r\nvillages in the name of the war on terrorism.  \r\n Were these interventions legal or justified? The \r\nportrayal of Somalia and the Union of Islamic Courts \r\n(UIC) as the epicentre or hub of terrorism was neither \r\ntrue nor candid. Somalis should and could have been \r\ngiven a chance to sort out their own problems through \r\nthe reconciliation processes that they had begun in \r\nearnest. But all of those efforts were nipped in the bud \r\nthrough a pre-emptive invasion by Ethiopia at the \r\ninstigation of the United States that resulted in massive \r\nhumanitarian tragedy that dwarfs other contemporary \r\ncrises in Africa. \r\n Nor is the situation in the Sudan any different, \r\neither. While the complexities of the long and varied \r\nconflicts cannot be downplayed, the fact remains that \r\nUnited States policy in the Sudan is driven by other \r\nobjectives and considerations. The net outcome has \r\nbeen and remains an aggravation of the multiple \r\nproblems there, whether in relation to the \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement between the North and South or with \r\nrespect to the situation in Darfur. \r\n Recently, the United States, which has a military \r\nbase in Djibouti, has fabricated a new conflict situation \r\nbetween Djibouti and Eritrea to keep alive the hot spots \r\nof tension in the region. As I explained earlier, due to \r\nUnited States influence, the Security Council has been \r\nparalysed and rendered impotent in the face of \r\nEthiopia’s occupation of sovereign Eritrean territories, \r\nincluding the town of Badme. At the same time, the \r\nUnited States doggedly tried to use the Security \r\nCouncil platform during its presidency last June to \r\nfabricate a non-existent problem and establish a case \r\nagainst Eritrea. \r\n All those destabilizing acts are sometimes \r\nportrayed as unavoidable consequences or collateral \r\ndamage of the war on terror. The fact is that the war on \r\nterror was derailed long ago from its original \r\nobjectives and intentions in order to undermine and \r\nsubvert forces and Governments that do not toe \r\nWashington’s line. Furthermore, the dragnet has been \r\nwidely extended to involve the transparent interference \r\nof the United States in the subregional and regional \r\norganizations in our part of the world. \r\n This untenable state of affairs cannot go on and \r\nshould not be tolerated. The human sufferings have \r\nbeen and are too great, the time too long. Therefore, \r\nthe collective international efforts to check United \r\nStates excesses are timely and imperative — all the \r\nmore so because those failures are widely recognized \r\nand acknowledged by significant segments of public \r\nopinion in the United States itself. \r\n The perils of unchecked unipolarism have \r\nbecome glaringly obvious in the past few years. That \r\nreality can only accentuate the need to bolster the \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 16 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations to make it a democratic and robust \r\ninstitution of multilateralism through prolonged and \r\nconcerted collective efforts. \r\n The need for prompt action requires great \r\nurgency, particularly in our region. For that to happen, \r\nfirst of all, illegal occupation of sovereign territories \r\nmust be terminated and the rule of law and the Charter \r\nof the United Nations fully respected. Secondly, the \r\ninvasion of Somalia must come to an end and the \r\nperpetrators of war crimes must be held accountable. \r\nThirdly, the interferences in and complications of the \r\nproblems in the Sudan must cease, and a conducive \r\nclimate must be created to bring about a lasting \r\nsolution. Lastly and most importantly, United States \r\nmeddling in the affairs of the Horn of Africa region, \r\nwhich has invariably led to the instigation of crises, \r\nmust be terminated. \r\n The consequences of failing to act are dire \r\nindeed. Unless effective measures are taken to remedy \r\nthe multiplying problems that our global community is \r\nconfronting today, we run the risk of further widening \r\nand exacerbating them. The situation in the Horn of \r\nAfrica may in fact spiral out of control unless those \r\ndestabilizing practices are brought to an end. \r\n In conclusion, I sincerely hope that our plea will \r\nbe heeded so that further turmoil and suffering in our \r\nregion may be avoided. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Leonard Edwards, Deputy \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Canada. \r\n Mr. Edwards (Canada): I am honoured to be here \r\ntoday on behalf of the Government of Canada to once \r\nagain reaffirm my country’s commitment to a strong \r\nand effective United Nations. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n For Canada, the United Nations remains \r\nindispensable for addressing the many global \r\nchallenges that confront us today, be it the search for \r\npeace and security, the promotion of human rights, \r\ndemocracy and international development, combating \r\nterrorism or the protection of the environment. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Those challenges require collective and \r\ncooperative strategies. They cannot be tackled by any \r\none country acting alone. That is why we must \r\nredouble our efforts to make the United Nations more \r\neffective and efficient so that it can deliver real results. \r\n Today, I would like to speak to the Assembly \r\nabout Canada’s priority global engagements, and how \r\nthey are helping to achieve the fundamental objectives \r\nof this Organization. \r\n From the very founding of the United Nations, \r\nCanada has contributed ideas, action and resources to \r\nhelp to fulfil its mandate. We helped to develop the \r\nconcept of peacekeeping. We helped it to meet the \r\nchanging nature of security, when more robust action \r\nwas required to end conflict, to protect civilians caught \r\nin the crossfire or to build peace in its aftermath. We \r\nhave served in successive peacekeeping and \r\npeacemaking operations and today we are serving on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Today, Canada is contributing to peace and \r\nsecurity and making sacrifices in places as diverse as \r\nAfghanistan, Haiti and the Sudan. Each of those \r\nCanadian engagements flows from a United Nations \r\nmandate. \r\n Canada’s largest and most important overseas \r\nengagement is in Afghanistan, where we have more \r\nthan 2,500 Canadians on the ground in support of the \r\nSecurity Council-mandated International Security \r\nAssistance Force. Canada continues to call for safe and \r\nunhindered humanitarian access to all those in need in \r\nAfghanistan. We condemn in the strongest possible \r\nterms the attack of 14 September against members of a \r\nUnited Nations convoy in Kandahar province who \r\nwere carrying out a polio vaccination campaign for \r\nAfghan children. \r\n Sadly, the Government of Afghanistan and the \r\ninternational community are all too familiar with such \r\nbrutal and cowardly tactics. We will not be swayed \r\nfrom our efforts to improve the lives of ordinary \r\nAfghans. To that end, at the International Conference \r\nin Support of Afghanistan in Paris, Canada announced \r\nthat it would make an additional contribution of $600 \r\nmillion for Afghanistan, bringing its overall total to \r\n$1.9 billion over the period from 2001 to 2011. \r\n Continued leadership by the United Nations is \r\nessential in Afghanistan. Canada stands behind the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. We \r\ncall on Member States to work with the United Nations \r\nto enhance the capacity of the Mission and to give it \r\nthe tools required to do its job. We remain ever mindful \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n17 08-53141 \r\n \r\nof the challenges that Afghanistan continues to \r\nconfront — security, access to basic services and \r\nimpending food shortages. Collectively, we — the \r\nStates assembled here — must deliver on the promises \r\nmade to the Afghan people. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Canada also remains committed to the promotion \r\nof security, governance and development in Haiti, \r\nefforts that are important for building a more \r\ndemocratic, prosperous and secure hemisphere. We \r\nconsider the partnership with the United Nations in \r\nHaiti to be an integral part of those efforts. That is why \r\nwe are providing the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) with civilian police \r\nofficers, military staff officers and corrections experts. \r\n Canada takes a comprehensive approach to \r\nreconstruction and development in Haiti. We are the \r\nsecond largest bilateral donor in Haiti, with a \r\n$555 million commitment over five years through 2011 \r\nin support of the country’s long-term reconstruction \r\nand development. MINUSTAH is in Haiti at the \r\nrequest of the Haitian Government, the most important \r\npartner of all in a commitment we share with Member \r\nStates within the hemisphere and beyond. Sustained \r\nefforts, political stability and lasting progress on \r\nreforms will combine to build a better future for all \r\nHaitians. \r\n Canada has also been a long-standing partner of \r\nthe United Nations efforts in Africa. When the \r\nSecretary-General took office, he said that one of his \r\ntop priorities would be the Sudan’s Darfur region. The \r\nUnited Nations presence in the Sudan is based on the \r\nvery principles underlying the United Nations Charter. \r\nThe engagement of the international community in the \r\nSudan remains vital. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n With contributions of over $477 million since \r\n2006, Canada remains deeply committed to building \r\nsustainable peace in the Sudan and alleviating the \r\nsuffering of those affected by the conflict. Canada’s \r\nsupport for peacekeeping operations in Sudan includes \r\nthe deployment of personnel, a loan of armoured \r\nvehicles and a large voluntary financial contribution. \r\nCanada underscores the importance of full \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement, and calls on Sudanese authorities and the \r\nrebel movements to end the violence in Darfur, \r\nfacilitate the deployment of the African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), \r\ncooperate with the International Criminal Court and \r\nrespect human rights. \r\n We are acutely aware that UNAMID is a difficult \r\nand often dangerous mission. In that regard, allow me \r\nto express the sincere condolences of the Canadian \r\nGovernment for the deaths resulting from the \r\nhelicopter crash in the Sudan earlier today — a tragedy \r\nthat underscores the very real threats United Nations \r\npersonnel continue to confront in the field. \r\n The current crisis in Georgia also calls for a \r\nunified international response. Canada supports the \r\ndemocratic and legitimate Government of Georgia and \r\nGeorgia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Canada \r\ncalls on Russia to fulfil its international obligations, \r\nreconsider its actions and cooperate fully with the \r\ninternational community to resolve the crisis in \r\nGeorgia in a peaceful manner. \r\n Canada has consistently sought to make the \r\nUnited Nations instruments for promoting peace and \r\nsecurity more effective. At the centre of those is, of \r\ncourse, the Security Council. Canada has long \r\nsupported proposals for greater accountability and \r\ntransparency of the Security Council to enable it better \r\nto shoulder the global peace and security \r\nresponsibilities entrusted to it by the 192 Member \r\nStates. Canada is committed to working with all \r\nMember States to promote a more unified and effective \r\nSecurity Council that can move past stalemate and take \r\ndecisive action against threats to security wherever \r\nthey may arise. \r\n We therefore welcome the recent decision of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to launch negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform at this session. It is important that we \r\nmake progress in those negotiations. For our part, \r\nCanada stands ready to support reform that ensures that \r\nnew realities are reflected in the Council while \r\npreserving accountability through the discipline of \r\nregular elections for Security Council membership. \r\n Canada is proud to be the seventh largest \r\ncontributor to the regular budget of the United Nations. \r\nWe are also a member of a wide range of United \r\nNations specialized agencies and a major contributor to \r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes. \r\nHumanitarianism and compassion are hallmarks of the \r\nCanadian identity. The United Nations is a key partner \r\nfor the delivery of Canadian humanitarian action, with \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 18 \r\n \r\nCanadian commitments this year totalling over \r\n$315 million. Our humanitarian assistance is aimed at \r\nhelping the world’s most vulnerable people, including \r\nchildren, refugees and victims of conflict and natural \r\ndisasters, and supports key United Nations programmes \r\nin those areas. \r\n Canada is on track to meet its international \r\nassistance commitments, and we are ensuring that our \r\naid is focused, effective and accountable. Canada will \r\ndeliver on its promise to double international \r\nassistance to $5 billion by 2010-2011. \r\n Canada is also serious about its commitment, \r\nundertaken in the Group of Eight, to double aid to \r\nAfrica, and I am pleased to say that we are on target to \r\nmeet that goal in 2009. Canada is also committed to \r\nworking in partnership with other stakeholders to \r\naccelerate development efforts to help achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. \r\n In response to the global food crisis, Canada \r\nprovided an extra $50 million for food aid, bringing \r\nour total contribution this year to $230 million — one \r\nof the largest in the world. Canada was also pleased to \r\nanswer an emergency request from the World Food \r\nProgramme (WFP) earlier this month to provide \r\nsecurity for its food aid shipments to Somalia. A \r\nCanadian Navy frigate, HMCS Ville de Québec, is \r\ncurrently escorting WFP ships carrying life-saving \r\nsupplies to Somalia. Canada recently extended the \r\nfrigate’s WFP escort mission until 23 October 2008. \r\n Canada is taking further concrete measures to \r\nenhance the effectiveness of our aid. We recently \r\nuntied 100 per cent of our food aid to make sure it can \r\nbe provided in the most efficient and effective way \r\npossible to the people who need it most. Canada is also \r\nfully untying all of its development assistance \r\nprogrammes by 2012-2013, in fulfilment of our \r\ncommitment to ensuring greater effectiveness of our \r\ninternational assistance. \r\n The challenges of environmental protection and \r\nsustainable development are rightly at the top of the \r\nglobal agenda. The most pressing challenge is that of \r\nclimate change, and the United Nations must play a \r\ncentral role. Canada is committed to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the need to reach consensus on a post-Bali \r\nframework.  \r\n The response to all global challenges begins at \r\nhome. However, the sum of national actions must drive \r\na collective effort at the international level. One of the \r\nmost important components of the Bali Road Map is \r\nthat it recognizes that no country can effectively \r\naddress climate change on its own and that all \r\ncountries in a position to act must do so. As such, \r\nCanada is fully aware of the importance of having all \r\nmajor global emitters take on meaningful and binding \r\nemissions reduction commitments in any future \r\ninternational agreement. \r\n Canada is also acutely aware of the risks faced by \r\ncountries most vulnerable to the impact of climate \r\nchange, particularly small island States and the least \r\ndeveloped countries. Canada is pleased to be a sponsor \r\nof a draft resolution on climate change and security put \r\nforward by the Pacific Island States. Canada has also \r\nsupported global efforts to promote climate change \r\nadaptation and has contributed both expertise and \r\nfinances to various United Nations and other \r\ninternational initiatives. \r\n Sixty years ago, this body adopted the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Canada is proud to \r\nrecall the contribution of Canadian John Peters \r\nHumphrey in penning the initial draft of that landmark \r\ninstrument. Sixty years on, we have not yet met that \r\n“common standard of achievement for all peoples and \r\nall nations” (resolution 217 (III)). We have much work \r\nleft to do. \r\n As a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nCanada is working hard to make that new institution \r\nlive up to the reform objectives that led to its creation \r\ntwo years ago. We have seen some progress and some \r\nsetbacks in ensuring that the Council’s agenda and \r\nfocus are balanced and objective. \r\n We must continually challenge ourselves to \r\nimprove our own records. The creation this year of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review, which Canada strongly \r\nsupported as an innovative improvement to the United \r\nNations human rights machinery, is an important tool \r\nto help States identify and address their continuing \r\nchallenges. \r\n As a community, we must stand up for the rule of \r\nlaw and for those whose rights are violated or \r\nundermined by the very institutions that should ensure \r\ntheir protection. That is why Canada will continue to \r\ntake strong stands against Governments that commit \r\nsystemic abuses against their populations. As \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n19 08-53141 \r\n \r\nGovernments, we must remain committed to working \r\ntogether to hold each other to account on our human \r\nrights records and to support countries that are making \r\nsincere efforts to advance the human rights of their \r\npeople. We must continue to strive for fundamental \r\nfreedoms and human rights in order to fulfil the ideals \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Canada supports an effective, soundly managed \r\nand results-driven United Nations. That is why it \r\nsupports broad reform. In that regard, we call for \r\nextensive reform in terms of management, especially in \r\nthe areas of oversight, accountability and human \r\nresource management. Those reforms are needed to \r\nbring the management of the United Nations in step \r\nwith the best practices of the twenty-first century and \r\nto equip it with the tools needed to deliver on the \r\nimportant mandates that we as Member States ask of it. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The values and ideals on which the United \r\nNations was founded — the promotion of peace and \r\nsecurity, of human rights and of greater prosperity for \r\nall through development cooperation — are also \r\nCanada’s and we stand ready to work within the United \r\nNations to address new challenges, such as climate \r\nchange and combating terrorism. I wish to repeat \r\nCanada’s willingness to work in partnership with all \r\nUnited Nations Member States towards the common \r\npurposes for which this Organization was created. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Ouch Borith, Secretary of \r\nState, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of the Kingdom of Cambodia. \r\n Mr. Borith (Cambodia): At the outset, I wish to \r\nwarmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann of the Republic of Nicaragua on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session. I can assure him of our fullest \r\ncooperation throughout his tenure. I have no doubt that, \r\nunder his able leadership, we will be successful during this \r\nsession. I also wish to extend my high appreciation to \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session, for his relentless efforts in \r\nguiding us to the many outstanding achievements \r\nduring the past year. \r\n At present, we have a number of global issues \r\nand challenges that we need to address, both \r\ncollectively and individually, in order to ensure a better \r\nworld for all of us. Undoubtedly, peace and security \r\nremain at the centre of our preoccupation that obliges \r\nus to take responsibility first and foremost. Terrorism \r\nis a stumbling block to the advancement and prosperity \r\nof our societies and the world at large. We need to \r\nrecommit ourselves and strengthen our practical \r\nmeasures, including putting in place a good strategy to \r\ncombat terrorism at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. We must enhance at all levels the \r\nrelevant existing instruments on counter-terrorism, in \r\nparticular the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, which was adopted by the General \r\nAssembly in December 2006. \r\n As for Cambodia, the Royal Government has \r\ndevoted its time, energy, efforts and resources to join \r\nthe international community in combating terrorism in \r\naccordance with the United Nations conventions, \r\nprotocols and agreements on security cooperation with \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations member \r\nStates, including its partners in the region. To live up to \r\nour strong commitment, the Law on Counter-terrorism \r\nwas promulgated by His Majesty the King of \r\nCambodia in July 2007, and our national mechanism in \r\nthat area has been constantly strengthened. \r\n Furthermore, our world is still marred by the \r\nspread of small arms and light weapons, which \r\ncontinue to have implications for our comprehensive \r\nsecurity and livelihoods. We need to address that issue \r\nwith seriousness and prompt actions. As a country that \r\nwas ravaged by war and conflict for more than two \r\ndecades, Cambodia experienced suffering from the use \r\nof small arms and light weapons and other weapons of \r\nwar. In that regard, we attach great importance to the \r\nagreed international instruments, especially the \r\nimplementation of the 2001 United Nations Programme \r\nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \r\nAspects. Over the years, Cambodia has taken practical \r\nmeasures to strictly control the use and circulation of \r\narms and ammunitions, as well as to eliminate the \r\nillegal procurement and sale of arms. \r\n On the issue of landmines and unexploded \r\nammunition, we are of the view that landmines are not \r\nonly a security problem, but also a humanitarian one, \r\nas their innocent victims become permanently \r\ntraumatized and physically handicapped, while their \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 20 \r\n \r\nfamilies suffer untold misery of spiritual and material \r\ndeprivation. \r\n The problems of landmines and unexploded ordnance \r\nhave been integrated into our national agenda — such as \r\nthe Cambodia millennium development goals, the National \r\nStrategic Development Plan and the Rectangular \r\nStrategy of the Royal Government of Cambodia — in \r\norder to cope with that challenging issue. Cambodia \r\nhighly appreciates the valuable contributions of \r\ndevelopment partners and donors in terms of financial \r\nand material support over the years. \r\n With our demining experience and as part of our \r\ncontribution to international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment, Cambodia has dispatched its third group \r\nof 135 deminers of the Royal Cambodian Armed \r\nForces to the Sudan for mine clearance activities under \r\nthe umbrella of the United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. \r\n We are now confronted more than ever with \r\nincreasing natural disasters, from floods to droughts, \r\nfrom tsunamis to storms and global warming, to name \r\njust a few that are caused mostly by climate change. \r\n Nowadays, industrialized countries consume 75 per \r\ncent of the world’s energy and produce 80 per cent of \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions, while developing countries, \r\nwhich produce little of such gas and have essentially \r\nagricultural economies, are the main victims of \r\nincreasing global warming and continuing climate \r\nchange. \r\n According to a report of the United Nations \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, if the \r\ntemperature increases by two degrees Celsius, up to \r\n30 per cent of plant and animal species worldwide \r\nwould be at risk of extinction. However, according to a \r\nseparate study of the Climate Change Policy Unit of \r\nthe World Wildlife Fund, it would take only 0.1 per \r\ncent of global gross domestic product to save the \r\nworld’s climate, and thus our own human survival. \r\n Fully aware of the danger and consequences of \r\nclimate change and global warming on the well-being, \r\nlivelihood, and development of people around the world, \r\nCambodia has led a vast campaign of reforestation \r\nthroughout our country, where 14,300 hectares were \r\nplanted between 2003 and 2006. The rationalization \r\nand ban of wood-cutting have been implemented. As a \r\nparty to the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, Cambodia has \r\nmade its utmost effort to implement the Convention \r\nand the Protocol, promote clean development \r\nmechanism projects, and to prepare a national \r\nadaptation programme of action on climate change. \r\nCambodia also strongly supports the Bali Action Plan \r\naimed at greenhouse gas reduction as well as the \r\nJapanese initiative Cool Earth 50. \r\n We are also of the view that, to help reverse \r\nclimate change, we will need to preserve nature’s \r\nbiodiversity as much as possible and to put an end to \r\nthe ongoing deforestation in the world, especially in \r\nthe least developed countries, by assisting people in \r\nfinding sources of income other than deforestation. \r\n It is also important for us to actively promote \r\nworld public participation in the issue by mobilizing \r\npublic awareness of the absolute necessity to work \r\ntogether to struggle against global warming and \r\nclimate change. We should forge a shared awareness of \r\nclimate change caused by industrialization, which is \r\nthe other side of the coin of development. We need to \r\nmobilize the support of all countries, especially the \r\nindustrialized developed nations, to respect and \r\nimplement the Framework Convention and its Kyoto \r\nProtocol. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to call on the \r\nUnited Nations to organize a world summit on climate \r\nchange so that the issue will remain at the top of world \r\nleaders’ agendas and to ensure that concrete and timely \r\nmeasures and action will be undertaken to help reverse \r\nthe current trend of global warming and climate \r\nchange. \r\n Concerning the Korean peninsula, we are \r\nconfident that the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the United States, as well as other parties \r\ninvolved, will maintain the momentum in fulfilling, in \r\ngood faith, the implementation of the 2005 Joint \r\nStatement for the sake of peace, stability and security \r\nin the region and the world at large. \r\n Regarding the Middle East, the peace process has \r\nbeen on our agenda for long enough and we are \r\nhopeful that all parties to the conflict will have the will \r\nand the wisdom to end the conflict as soon as possible \r\nin the interests of all countries concerned. In that \r\nregard, Cambodia welcomes the 24 June 2008 Quartet \r\nstatement and the ongoing negotiations between Israel \r\nand Palestine to bring about peace. Israel and Palestine \r\nmust seize this opportunity to use every potential for \r\nachieving an agreement acceptable to both sides. \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n21 08-53141 \r\n \r\n With regard to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), eight years have gone by since their \r\nadoption. We all know that the pace of achieving \r\nprogress towards the MDGs is very slow and that we \r\nrisk the possibility of missing the 2015 target date. The \r\noutcomes of the high-level meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals have clearly underlined the \r\nimportance for the need to continue implementing the \r\nMDGs with greater effectiveness by enhancing closer \r\ncooperation between developed and developing \r\ncountries. \r\n In that regard, there is a need to ensure greater \r\nflows of financing for development through foreign \r\ndirect investment, official development assistance and \r\nmore trade. At the same time, developed countries \r\nshould make greater efforts to transfer innovative and \r\nrelevant technology to developing countries. \r\n For its part, Cambodia is firmly dedicated to \r\nachieving the MDGs. Various strategies for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and poverty alleviation are in the early \r\nstages of elaboration. The eight United Nations Goals \r\nhave been incorporated into the framework of our \r\nNational Strategic Development Plan, the Cambodian \r\nmillennium development goals and the Rectangular \r\nStrategy. Over the years, with those development \r\nblueprints Cambodia experienced a double-digit \r\neconomic growth of 11.1 per cent on average from \r\n2004 through 2007 and the poverty rate dropped from \r\n35 per cent to 31 per cent. \r\n In addition, Cambodia is fully committed to \r\nimplementing the principle of good governance and \r\nmaintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal \r\ndiscipline. The policy of the Royal Government of \r\nCambodia is to conserve its domestic resources in \r\norder to finance the needs of national development. \r\n However, domestic resources are not enough to \r\nfinance investment needs for maintaining the economic \r\ngrowth rate at an acceptable level and as a response to \r\nkey socio-economic targets, including the MDGs. \r\nTherefore, Cambodia continues to need financial \r\ncooperation from its development partners in order to \r\nsupport ongoing national development and poverty \r\nreduction. \r\n For years, we have all agreed that the United \r\nNations needs reform. Despite our concerted efforts \r\nand some progress, differences remain on how to make \r\nthe United Nations more effective and more relevant in \r\ndealing with the numerous challenges we face today \r\nthroughout the world. Cambodia is of the view that \r\nUnited Nations reform must be comprehensive and \r\nrealistic. In order to move forward, we should continue \r\nto build greater consensus and uphold the common \r\ninterests of all, without discrimination. \r\n For almost 15 years now, Member States have \r\nintensely deliberated Security Council reform. \r\nCambodia has consistently reiterated its position in \r\nsupport of the expansion of the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council. \r\n However, we have not yet achieved any \r\nacceptable modality and clear framework for the \r\nreform. Therefore, Security Council reform has \r\nremained deadlocked. Although we have agreed that \r\nthe status quo is not acceptable, we must not lose the \r\nmomentum. In addition, we need to redouble our \r\ncollective efforts to ensure a breakthrough in the \r\ncurrent impasse of Security Council reform. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to Mr. Roy Chaderton Matos, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\n Mr. Chaderton Matos (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): For Venezuelans, Latin \r\nAmericans and Caribbeans, it is an honour, Sir, to have \r\nyou as President of the General Assembly at this \r\nsession. No one is a more authentic Christian than a \r\nprogressive Christian. It is a risky position and one \r\nwhich requires sacrifice for a person like yourself, \r\nwhose life has been a testament to his lofty values. \r\nIndeed, this criterion is valid for Muslims, Jews, \r\nBuddhists, animists, Hindus, atheists, and so on if their \r\nlives are a testament to their respective ethical \r\nobligations. \r\n There is another religion whose adherents and \r\npriests preach from their temples. It is the religion of \r\nneoliberalism, whose god is the market. \r\n A few years ago, a well-known academic, \r\ncaptivated by his own materialistic image, announced \r\nthe end of history, claiming that we had reached not the \r\nfountain of eternal youth but the secret to eternal \r\nprosperity. Today, prompted by the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we \r\nqualify that thought as a curse that reflects the \r\ninsensitivity of the most egotistical and corrupt. \r\n At the time of the French Revolution someone \r\nsaid “Freedom, how many crimes are committed in \r\nyour name?” These days we could say “Free market, \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 22 \r\n \r\nhow much poverty, how much violence, how much \r\ntorture, how many wars, how many invasions, how \r\nmuch oppression, how much social injustice is \r\ncommitted in your name?” We are, therefore, \r\nsympathetic with President Nicolas Sarkozy’s peace \r\ninitiatives and his appropriate ideas about a regulated \r\ncapitalism and a summit of countries affected by the \r\nfinancial crisis. \r\n Accustomed as we were to suffering the perverse \r\neffects of the brutal application of neoliberal policies, \r\ntoday we see the pain, anguish and anger of millions of \r\nour brothers in the United States. They have been \r\nswindled by upper-class criminals, an experience that \r\nwe Venezuelans know well. \r\n Since memory is fragile and the neoliberal global \r\ndictatorship uses private communications media to hide \r\nits crimes, allow me to recount a terrible event that \r\noccurred in the country that was the first lab rat for the \r\nmost radical formula from Wall Street and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. I am speaking of my \r\ncountry, Venezuela. \r\n In only two days, in February 1989, a \r\nspontaneous people’s rebellion was mercilessly \r\ncrushed. It was a protest against the application, \r\nwithout anaesthesia, of the magic formulas that the \r\ngreat financial centres imposed on us. Several \r\nnon-governmental human rights organizations at the \r\ntime registered thousands of deaths, but the official \r\nstatistics recognized only 259 dead, without \r\nmentioning those who were injured or material \r\ndamage — only 259 dead in two days. \r\n As a diplomat in those terrible days, I assumed \r\nthat there would be complaints and condemnations \r\nfrom friendly Governments with good human-rights \r\ntrack records. Nothing of the sort happened. Venezuela \r\nwas the pet project of Latin American democracies \r\nand, at the same time, a neoliberal laboratory whose \r\nfailure had to be kept secret. The media accomplices of \r\nyesterday that kept these crimes secret are the same \r\nthat today slander the democratic, peaceful, socialist \r\nrevolutionary Venezuelan process led by President \r\nHugo Chávez. \r\n In Venezuela we practice extreme democracy: \r\nextreme freedom of expression, extreme participation, \r\nextreme challenge to the neoliberal monster and \r\nextreme commitment to social justice, hence the \r\ninternational media campaign to attempt to slander and \r\nstifle democracy in Venezuela. The instruments of that \r\ncampaign have a name: the Fox network in the United \r\nStates, the Grupo de Diarios de América, the Inter \r\nAmerican Press Association, the neocolonialist group \r\nPromotora de Informaciones, S.A., the El Pais daily, \r\nthe Cadena de Ondas Populares de España (COPE) \r\nradio network of the blessed Catholic Bishops’ \r\nConference of Spain, the El Mercurio daily in Chile, \r\nthe El Universal daily in Mexico, the pro-coup \r\nVenezuelan television station Globovision, and many \r\nother lackeys of the international far right. \r\n That brings to mind a topic that no one talks \r\nabout. Some people think that Nelson Mandela did \r\naway with apartheid. In the United States, the people \r\nwe see on the television screens are like the people we \r\nsee in the streets. Not so in Latin America, in \r\nVenezuela and in multi-ethnic Latin American \r\ncountries. On their televisions we do not see people of \r\nmixed races, nor indigenous people, nor Afro-Latin \r\nAmericans unless they are playing the role of the \r\nservants. Hence the racist hatred against the indigenous \r\nmajority in Bolivia. Racism is the most perverse form \r\nof discrimination. In the worst dictatorships and under \r\npersecution, it is possible to hide one’s thoughts, faith \r\nand political affiliation. But what one can never hide is \r\nthe colour of one’s skin. \r\n Democracy, international social justice and peace \r\ncannot survive under the schemes of unilateralism and \r\nthe muscular exercises of hegemonic powers. Dissent \r\nshould not be punished but rather recognized as an \r\nexpression of democratic and pacifist values. \r\nAppreciation of and respect for those who are different \r\nis a guarantee of the fulfilment of the principles \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Democracy \r\nand peace should stem from creativity and the \r\nconfidence generated by the variety of ideas, colours, \r\ninterests and proposals. \r\n Progressive democracy has burgeoned in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, particularly within the past \r\n10 years, just as the continent has been undergoing \r\nprofound social change. Long ago, during the sixties \r\nand seventies, the magic solution to attain the complete \r\ndemocracy and social progress that some preached was \r\nthrough free and transparent elections, although in \r\ncertain select circumstances the elections were neither \r\nvery democratic nor very transparent. Nevertheless, \r\nthey were welcomed into the so-called democratic \r\nclub, since they adhered to unspoken patterns of \r\npolitical behaviour dictated by the global metropolis. \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n23 08-53141 \r\n \r\n It is a fact that today in Latin America elections \r\nare more participatory, more transparent and freer than \r\never. Nevertheless, the results are not welcomed when \r\nthe winners have previously been labelled as villains \r\nby the imperial super-Power. \r\n The spectre of progressive democracy is lying in \r\nwait for the continent of social injustice. People are \r\ndeciding their own destiny, as they should. But they are \r\nmaking this choice with a clear preference for leftist \r\nmovements that offer a response to their circumstances. \r\nThat does not suit the far right, which is no lover of \r\ndemocracy, as much as it claims to be. \r\n That reminds me to some extent of Henry Ford, \r\nwhen he spoke of his great success in selling the \r\nModel T. He said “Any customer can have a car \r\npainted any colour that he wants so long as it is black”. \r\nSomething similar is happening with the super-Power \r\nand its partners on our continent. Anyone who wins \r\nfree and transparent elections monitored by credible \r\ninternational observers is accepted, provided that \r\nperson is right-wing. \r\n Dissent is not accepted by some people in the \r\nglobal village. The new movements, which are \r\nsupported by the majority of those who are excluded, \r\nare not welcome. The magnates of private media are \r\nthemselves a threat to democracy and freedom, \r\naligning themselves with the interests they serve, while \r\npoisoning the collective psyche of the more timid \r\ngroups in society. \r\n Concerted efforts to undermine legitimate \r\ninstitutions are being launched and consolidated under \r\nfundamentalist doctrines. New witch hunts identify that \r\nphenomenon, and the fundamentalists of the right are \r\nembarking on well-coordinated and well-financed \r\nventures while continuing to sign off on huge corporate \r\ndeals. Such is the case with the Halliburton company, \r\nwhose balance sheets are spattered with Arab and \r\nAmerican blood. All the while, Al Qaeda is bigger than \r\never, and the weapons of mass destruction have still \r\nnot been found. \r\n Homegrown right-wing and racist forces, \r\nemboldened by foreign support, do not recognize the \r\nlegitimacy of new or renewed institutions and cause \r\npolitical and social instability and separatism. Look at \r\nBolivia. In Ecuador, those groups will not accept the \r\noverwhelming popular support provided yesterday to \r\nPresident Correa’s draft constitution, so we will have \r\nto invite him to come in and join the axis of evil. \r\n In any case, there is not much to worry about \r\nwhen it comes to the leftist democracies. They are very \r\nmodern, in the sense that they do not have religious or \r\ngender police, while on the other hand they are \r\nantiquated democracies, where those who gain the \r\nmost votes come in first and are elected. \r\n The drama of poverty, social exclusion and \r\nuneven distribution of income still tyrannizes our \r\ncountries. The current model of development is not \r\nsustainable. It endangers life, the planet and peace. As \r\nlong as there is still hunger, our democracies and our \r\nenvironment are threatened. The time for profound and \r\ndemanding changes has come. Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, in his address to this Assembly at its 5th \r\nmeeting, referred to the need for a new understanding \r\non business ethics, with more compassion and less \r\nunconditional faith in the magic of the markets. Greed \r\nand consumerism have brought about climate change, \r\nthe energy crisis, financial chaos and the food crisis. \r\n The world food crisis continues to expand. Food \r\nhas become just a form of merchandise used to \r\nmaximize profits, with the human right to food \r\nignored. According to the statistics of the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization, global food production has \r\nconsistently exceeded global population growth. That \r\nmeans that sufficient food is produced in the world to \r\nprovide more than 2,800 calories every day to each of \r\nthe world’s inhabitants. Close to 18 per cent more \r\ncalories are produced per person than was the case in \r\nthe 1960s, despite the increase in the total population. \r\nIf sufficient food is produced in the world, how can we \r\nexplain the fact that more than 850 million people now \r\nsuffer from hunger or malnutrition, that 25,000 people \r\ndie from hunger every day and that 18,000 of those are \r\nchildren?  \r\n The Secretary-General has stated that \r\ndevelopment is in a state of emergency, and he \r\ncontinues to appeal for progress on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Venezuela promotes policies for social inclusion, \r\npublic policies to ensure everyone’s rights. In order to \r\nbuild a new model for development on the basis of \r\nsolidarity, social justice, equity, cooperation, respect \r\nfor human rights and the participation of the people, \r\nVenezuela has a comprehensive social development \r\npolicy based on the human being. The foundation of \r\nthat policy is social missions undertaken through wide-\r\nranging and free social and economic programmes to \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 24 \r\n \r\nreach out to all sectors of society, with a particular \r\nemphasis on the most vulnerable, in order to guarantee \r\nthe social and economic rights of our people in peace \r\nand democracy. \r\n With great satisfaction and humility, our country \r\ncan share with the Assembly the progress we have \r\nachieved in implementing the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The number of people in extreme \r\npoverty has dropped in our country, and there has been \r\nan increase of 10.8 per cent in primary school \r\nattendance. Unemployment has dropped from 23 per \r\ncent to 7 per cent. In recent years, gross domestic \r\nproduct expenditures on health have increased by 57.1 \r\nper cent. We provide total coverage to those suffering \r\nfrom AIDS. The proportion of the population with \r\naccess to drinking water has increased from 80 per cent \r\nin 1998 to 95 per cent in 2007. During the period from \r\n1996 to 2007, infant mortality dropped from 23.4 to \r\n13.4 per 1,000 live births. \r\n Venezuela has made major contributions to \r\nefforts for cooperation and complementarity between \r\nthe countries of the South. The Bolivarian Alternative \r\nfor the Americas (ALBA), which was established by \r\nBolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Dominica, Honduras and \r\nVenezuela, is an initiative that brings together the \r\nabilities and strengths of its members to bring about \r\nstructural change and the relationships necessary to \r\nachieve development and continue to exist as sovereign \r\nand just nations. \r\n Petrocaribe is an energy cooperation agreement \r\nproposed by the Government of Bolivia to resolve the \r\nasymmetries in the region between energy producers \r\nand consumers by means of a new, equitable and just \r\nsystem of trade between the countries of the Caribbean \r\nregion. \r\n The Union of South American Nations \r\n(UNASUR) is an ongoing political endeavour, which, \r\nin its short existence, has shown that it is politically \r\neffective and respects the sovereignty of peoples. It has \r\narrived at common positions on projects in the fields of \r\nenergy, social affairs, finance, education, \r\ninfrastructure, dispute resolution and defence, and has \r\ngone beyond mere talk to become part of daily life of \r\nthe citizens of South America. The recent unanimous \r\nsupport of President Evo Morales and democracy in \r\nBolivia is a good example of that. \r\n The President of the General Assembly, \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, stated that more than \r\na half of the peoples of the Earth languish in hunger \r\nand poverty while ever-increasing amounts of money \r\nare wasted on arms, wars, luxury items and totally \r\nsuperfluous and unnecessary goods. \r\n That addiction to war is the only thing that can \r\nexplain the fact that, after the collapse of the Soviet \r\nUnion, war-loving countries and alliances continued to \r\nchip away, day after day, at Russian democracy and to \r\nintrigue in the region against Moscow instead of \r\nabandoning their threats of war and trying to resolve \r\nthe lack of trust that is the source of conflict and \r\nviolence. It is a disgraceful situation that has not \r\nwanted for ignorant cowboys who think they are \r\nheroes. The Russian bear is awakening from its \r\nhibernation. \r\n How many human lives have we lost among \r\nIraqis, Americans, Latin Americans, Europeans, Asians \r\nand Africans? And how many lives could we save if the \r\nresources devoted to war and to the recovery of \r\nfinancial institutions were devoted instead to social \r\ninvestment? \r\n The reform process requires the adoption of \r\nmeasures to strengthen the authority of the General \r\nAssembly, including on matters of international peace \r\nand security, given that it is the principal deliberating, \r\nparticipatory and democratic body of the Organization. \r\nVenezuela supports the expansion of both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council, the abolishment of the \r\nantidemocratic post-war mechanism of the veto and the \r\nimprovement of the Council’s working methods, so \r\nthat it may be more transparent and accessible and so \r\nthat never again will anyone resort to lying to the \r\nCouncil. \r\n We must remain vigilant to ensure that the \r\nHuman Rights Council continues to operate on the \r\nbasis of principles of impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity without stigmatizing anyone and to \r\npromote constructive dialogue, without diversions \r\nabout certification, cooperation without preconditions \r\nor vetoes, and respect for the particular circumstances \r\nof nations and regions, as well as for our diverse \r\nhistorical, cultural and religious pasts. \r\n We reject racist, xenophobic and discriminatory \r\nmeasures that clearly deny the human rights that \r\nshould apply universally to all, including migrants. \r\nCriminalizing migrants and their families violates their \r\nfundamental rights. Measures such as the Return \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n25 08-53141 \r\n \r\nDirective approved by the European Parliament incite \r\nracism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination \r\nand intolerance. That is incompatible with the defence, \r\npromotion and protection of human rights, democracy \r\nand the rule of law. We prefer a Europe of light, \r\nintegration and reconciliation to a Europe of shadows. \r\n We know that we are not at the end of history; we \r\nare not even at the beginning of the end of history. \r\nWhat we do know is that we are apparently at the close \r\nof a chapter of history, at the end of a neoliberal \r\nnightmare in which unbridled capitalism — as John \r\nPaul II described it — social violence and the \r\npersistent worldwide violation of all human rights \r\nprevailed. \r\n This afternoon, the House of Representatives of \r\nthe United States of America took an historic decision \r\nwhose effects will be felt throughout the world in the \r\ntimes to come. Very soon next year, we hope to be able \r\nto say that the worst has past and that the perverse \r\neffects of the religion of the market will be replaced, \r\nGod willing, on the global level, allowing us to move \r\ntowards democracy, progress and social justice, \r\nensuring peace among nations — among nations that \r\nare free and stand together, among nations that are \r\nunited. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to Her Excellency Rosemary Banks, chair of the \r\ndelegation of New Zealand. \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): Sixty-three years \r\nafter its formation, the United Nations remains the \r\nworld’s central international body. Only here do all \r\ncountries come together to devise solutions and to \r\nforge collective action on global challenges. And these \r\nare particularly challenging times. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and many others have noted, we are facing a \r\nglobal financial crisis, a global energy crisis and a \r\nglobal food crisis. More than ever before, we are an \r\ninterconnected and interdependent world community. \r\nThe Charter goals of peace and prosperity require the \r\nfull support of all United Nations Members. New \r\nZealand was a founding member in 1945, and our \r\ncommitment to this body is as strong now as it was \r\nthen. \r\n At such a difficult time in the world we need \r\nleadership, courage and a recommitment of our \r\nresources to tackle the issues before us. When the food \r\ncrisis was first in the headlines, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-Level Task Force provided a \r\nmechanism for us all to respond. Having contributed \r\nnearly $NZ 10 million to date, New Zealand is among \r\nthose assisting with urgent food security needs and \r\nmedium-term policy responses. A successful \r\nconclusion of the Doha Development Round would \r\nalleviate much of the pressure on the demand-supply \r\nimbalance. \r\n On the development theme of this sixty-third \r\nsession, New Zealand fully associates with the \r\nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) Global Call to \r\nAction Campaign. Support is urgently needed to \r\nrevitalize collective efforts, including developing and \r\nstrengthening partnerships between traditional and new \r\ndonors, the private sector and civil society, and through \r\nSouth-South cooperation. We are set to play our part. \r\n New Zealand is significantly stepping up official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) from 0.27 per cent of \r\ngross national income in 2007 to 0.35 per cent by \r\n2010-2011. That 62 per cent increase will take New \r\nZealand aid to over $NZ 600 million. \r\n We are acutely aware that the Pacific is the \r\nsecond region after sub-Saharan Africa that is least \r\nlikely to meet the MDG targets. We are therefore \r\nlooking to direct our increased ODA there, through a \r\nPacific strategy, which focuses poverty reduction \r\nefforts around four key pillars: strengthening \r\ngovernance, achieving broader-based growth and \r\nsustainable livelihoods, improving health and \r\neducation, and reducing vulnerabilities, including to \r\nclimate change. \r\n In these challenging times, we look to the United \r\nNations to deliver effectively for development, for \r\npeace and security and on human rights. Our \r\nOrganization must continue to evolve along with the \r\nchanging demands on it. Momentum needs to be \r\nmaintained in the modernization of the United Nations. \r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s vision for that and \r\nsupport his proposals to fix the human resources \r\nmanagement system, which he has characterized as \r\ndysfunctional. \r\n I would now like to turn to the challenges of \r\npeace and security around the world, from which our \r\nown region is not immune. At the Pacific Islands \r\nForum held in Niue last month, New Zealand and other \r\nmembers of the Pacific Forum community expressed \r\nprofound disappointment at Fiji’s lack of progress \r\ntowards restoring democratic government. The Forum \r\ncommuniqué urged the interim regime in Fiji to fulfil \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 26 \r\n \r\nits promise to hold elections in accordance with Fiji’s \r\nexisting constitution by March next year. Leaders also \r\nacknowledged that there were long-term issues to be \r\nresolved in Fiji and supported a Commonwealth-led \r\nindependent and inclusive political dialogue process to \r\naddress them. That will not only create a more \r\nconducive environment for elections, but also enable a \r\nnewly elected Government to engage with key \r\nstakeholders to promote national reconciliation. New \r\nZealand urges all United Nations Members to support \r\nthe steps taken by the Pacific Islands Forum to \r\nencourage Fiji to return to democratic and \r\nconstitutional government as soon as possible. \r\nMr. Nsengimana (Rwanda), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Our region is also home to Timor-Leste, a partner \r\nand friend of New Zealand. We are pleased to see \r\nencouraging progress since last year’s elections, \r\nespecially the building of institutions and improving \r\ngovernance. That was achieved despite assassination \r\nattempts on Timor-Leste’s leadership. The United \r\nNations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) \r\nand the International Stabilization Force continue to \r\nplay a valuable role in helping to maintain security. \r\nNew Zealand strongly supports the UNMIT mandate \r\nand its extension beyond February 2009. Planning for \r\nsecurity in the longer term, to ensure appropriately \r\nsized and resourced institutions with clearly delineated \r\nroles and responsibilities, is also a key issue, and we \r\nstand ready to help. \r\n Also within our region, the political, economic \r\nand human rights situation in Myanmar remains \r\ntroubling. We urge the Myanmar authorities to achieve \r\nnational reconciliation through open and constructive \r\ndialogue and to respect universal human rights in the \r\ncountry, consistent with international obligations. We \r\nsupport the efforts of the United Nations to sustain a \r\ndialogue with the Myanmar Government in order to \r\nbuild foundations for the future. \r\n On the African continent, the humanitarian \r\ndisaster caused by the conflict in Darfur is \r\nunacceptable. The targeting of civilians by State and \r\nnon-State parties, is a flagrant breach of international \r\nhuman rights law. The widespread absence of justice \r\nand accountability for such human rights violations and \r\nthe impunity that this promotes represent major \r\nobstacles to improving the human rights situation in \r\nDarfur. \r\n In the case of Zimbabwe, the recent \r\nannouncement of a power-sharing agreement offers \r\nhope that the long period of violent repression and \r\nhuman rights abuses by the previous Government can \r\nbe brought to a close. The international community \r\nwill be watching closely to see that all parties fulfil the \r\ncommitments that they have made to bring about \r\npeace, respect for political freedom and human rights \r\nand a Government which reflects the will of the \r\npeople. \r\n Let me turn now to the Middle East. New \r\nZealand continues to be strongly supportive of all \r\nattempts to find a lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. We share the international community’s vision \r\nfor a viable and territorially contiguous Palestinian \r\nState, existing side by side in peace and security with \r\nthe State of Israel. \r\n In Afghanistan, despite political progress, the \r\noverall situation is fragile. The international \r\ncommunity needs to devote more resources to ending \r\nthe conflict and to assisting the people of Afghanistan \r\nin their efforts to stabilize and rebuild their country. \r\nNew Zealand has expressed a strong commitment to \r\nrestoring peace and security in Afghanistan with our \r\nassistance, both military and developmental, totalling \r\nmore than 160 million New Zealand dollars to date. \r\n Closer to home, New Zealand welcomes the \r\nrecent improvement in cross-Strait relations. Cross-\r\nStrait stability is vital to the security of the greater \r\nAsia-Pacific region. We encourage China and Taiwan \r\nto maintain the dialogue which has been established. \r\n New Zealand remains a strong supporter of \r\nefforts to protect and maintain the international rule of \r\nlaw. To that end, one of the most significant advances \r\nin recent times has been the establishment of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). When the ICC was \r\nfirst established, it was widely considered to herald the \r\nbeginning of a new era in international criminal justice. \r\nThe Court has now reached a crucial stage in its \r\ndevelopment, and it has become clear that the \r\nestablishment of a global justice system brings with it \r\nmany challenges. It is of the utmost importance that \r\nStates rise to those challenges. To fail to do so would \r\nbe a betrayal of the victims of egregious crimes. New \r\nZealand urges States to make every effort to ensure the \r\nindependence and success of the Court. The Court \r\nneeds our full support and cooperation to ensure that \r\nindividuals responsible for the most serious violations \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n27 08-53141 \r\n \r\nof international law are brought to justice without \r\ndelay. \r\n In this sixtieth anniversary year of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, we acknowledge the \r\nmany international human rights conventions that have \r\narisen out of that unique statement of overriding \r\nprinciples. New Zealand played an active part in the \r\ndesign of the new Human Rights Council, and we are \r\nseeking election to the Council next year, so as to be \r\nmore closely involved in its work. \r\n The newest member of the family of human \r\nrights treaties is the Convention on the Rights of \r\nPersons with Disabilities, which New Zealand ratified \r\nthis month. We look forward to the first conference of \r\nStates parties, and to the opportunity the Convention \r\noffers to make a real improvement in the lives and \r\nhuman rights of disabled people everywhere. \r\n Finally, let me reiterate the importance that New \r\nZealand attaches to the concept of the responsibility to \r\nprotect. The United Nations, through the Security \r\nCouncil, should be prepared to protect people against \r\nethnic cleansing, genocide, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity when national authorities fail to do \r\nso. There is a clear need to enhance early warning \r\nsystems to enable the Council to act in a timely \r\nmanner. We look forward to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the responsibility to protect, and we stand \r\nready to help to take that important initiative forward. \r\n As we look forward to the year ahead, New \r\nZealand pledges to work actively with others in our \r\ncollective stewardship of the United Nations. We shall \r\nplay our part in the continuing, patient process of \r\nrenewing our Organization and of making it more \r\nresilient and responsive. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Don Pramudwinai, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Thailand. \r\n Mr. Pramudwinai (Thailand): The attachment \r\nthat Thailand has had to the ideals and principles that \r\ngave birth to the United Nations is long, enduring and \r\nnatural. From the very first day in this family of \r\nnations more than 60 years ago, Thailand, or Siam at \r\nthat time, made known to all that we stood for peace, \r\nfor freedom and for tolerance, because peace, freedom \r\nand tolerance are part of our national character — a \r\npart of who we are. Today, our commitment to peace, \r\nfreedom and tolerance anywhere and everywhere \r\nremains unwavering, and it will remain so. \r\n Therefore, I warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, a man of peace, freedom and \r\ntolerance, on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. His cause is our \r\ncause, and he can rest assured that the Thai delegation \r\nwill give him its full support and cooperation. \r\n We are living in a world of enormous \r\nopportunities for progress. But we are also living in a \r\nworld that is in a state of flux, a world that is drifting \r\nfrom one crisis to another. The information technology \r\nrevolution and transportation advancements have \r\nbrought people from all corners of the world closer \r\ntogether than ever before. We are now living in a \r\nglobal village, but, sadly, this village is not united as \r\none. This village is deeply divided along political, \r\neconomic, social, racial, religious and cultural lines. \r\nThat is not sustainable; it is not healthy. It should not \r\nbe allowed to go on. All of us have a stake in this. We \r\nmust not take those divisions for granted or as a given, \r\nbecause they are not. \r\n We need to reclaim the ideal that brought us \r\ntogether in this place: the ideal of “We the peoples”. \r\nWe need to cultivate and nurture a “we” feeling among \r\nus. We must try our best to focus on what binds us \r\ntogether rather than on what keeps us apart. We must \r\nbe fully aware that to continue to see the world through \r\nthe glasses of “us versus them” can only lead to \r\nconfrontation. And confrontation helps no one, \r\nbecause, at the end of the day, in this interconnected \r\nglobalized world, no one wins everything, but \r\neveryone can lose everything. As Mahatma Gandhi \r\nonce admonished, “An eye for an eye, and soon the \r\nwhole world is blind”. \r\n We have a choice between progress and self-\r\ndestruction, between cooperation and confrontation, \r\nand between amity and animosity. The choice is for all \r\nof us to make, and the choice is clear. There is no \r\nbetter alternative to progress, cooperation and amity \r\namong nations and peoples. \r\n The Thai people have made their choice. It is for \r\ndemocracy. The challenge now in Thailand, as in other \r\ncountries around the world, is to find the right balance \r\nbetween the political culture and the desire for \r\ndemocratic ideals. Nurturing a democratic culture in \r\nany country takes time and requires an appreciation of \r\nthe fact that it is an evolutionary process in which ups \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 28 \r\n \r\nand downs are to be expected. Thailand’s democratic \r\nevolution is no exception. \r\n What is unique about the present state of political \r\nevolution in Thailand is the consistent expression of \r\nour national character: we stand for peace, for freedom \r\nand for tolerance. Indeed, Thai political developments \r\nhave made a lot of headlines lately. But we trust that \r\ngood eyes and informed minds will not mistake recent \r\nevents for the trajectory of a nation. Thai people are \r\nresilient people. The Thai society is a resilient society. \r\nAnd Thai people and Thai society are determined to \r\nmove ahead along the democratic path. \r\n The world has made a choice with respect to \r\ndevelopment. That choice is embodied in the \r\nMillennium Declaration and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We are now midway \r\ntowards 2015, the target year for their realization. \r\nWhile there have been many remarkable and \r\nencouraging success stories of progress so far — in \r\nreducing poverty, hunger and disease, to name a few — \r\nthere are also unremarkable and discouraging stories of \r\nsetbacks. For far too many countries, the realization of \r\nthe MDGs by 2015 has become increasingly difficult to \r\nachieve. Thailand therefore is pleased to see the \r\ninternational community coming together as one in its \r\ndetermination to work harder to help people in each \r\nand every country enjoy the fruits of developmental \r\nprogress and well-being. \r\n To help one another to have a better life is a \r\nmoral imperative as well as a practical necessity. Can \r\nanyone afford to live happily and sleep soundly on an \r\nisland of opulence in the middle of a sea of poverty and \r\ndespair? Certainly, the answer is no. It is after all in the \r\nenlightened self-interest of every country to ensure that \r\nthe MDG targets are met — as many and as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n Our unity as “We the peoples” is all the more \r\nimportant in the face of the perfect storm that is the \r\nglobal oil crisis, food crisis and financial crisis. These \r\nmultiple crises threaten to derail the achievements of \r\nthe MDGs or even to undo hard-won gains of the past \r\nin many countries. Developing countries need stability \r\nand security in the world energy market. Every dollar \r\nhike resulting from speculation on oil price futures \r\nbeing traded on futures market floors means \r\ndevelopment costs for the Governments of developing \r\ncountries and affects the livelihoods of ordinary people \r\naround the world. \r\n But in every crisis, there exists an opportunity. \r\nThe exponential rise in oil prices has made it necessary \r\nfor countries to adapt their patterns of consumption and \r\nto rethink their energy security strategies. The global \r\noil crisis has not spared Thailand: our people have been \r\nadversely affected by the skyrocketing oil prices in \r\nalmost every aspect of their lives. \r\n At the same time, Thailand has learned to adapt \r\nand adjust. Energy efficiency and the development of \r\nalternative energy sources, such as liquefied gas, \r\nbiofuels and gasohol, are now being pursued with \r\ngreater urgency. Because of the global oil crisis, more \r\nand more vehicles in Thailand today have been shifted \r\nto various sources of alternative energy. This market \r\nfor alternative energy is booming in Thailand and \r\nacross Asia. There is so much potential in this market, \r\nand Thailand stands ready to work together with our \r\nfriends from around the world in all endeavours \r\npertaining to research in and development of \r\nalternative energy. \r\n Developing countries need stability and security \r\nin the world food market. In addressing these \r\nchallenges, we should not forget that the current food \r\ncrisis has had multiple causes, such as the global oil \r\ncrisis, drought and flooding. To be effective, any \r\nattempt to address this world food crisis must be \r\ncomprehensive and concerted. It must look at the short-\r\nterm imperative of keeping the supply flowing in the \r\nworld market while working towards the longer-term \r\nimperative of stabilizing food prices and enhancing \r\nproductivity. \r\n As a rice bowl of the world, Thailand will \r\ncontinue to ensure a constant supply to the world rice \r\nmarket. We will continue to work with other countries \r\nto enhance productivity and ensure food security. In the \r\npast, we had an industrial revolution and an \r\ninformation technology revolution. Now, we believe, is \r\nthe time for the next revolution: a green revolution. We \r\nwill continue to work with countries around the world \r\nto ensure an open international food market and \r\nestablish agricultural trade rules that help the world’s \r\npoor farmers and shore up food security in developing \r\ncountries. To that end, the Doha Development Round \r\nshould resume as soon as possible. \r\n Developing countries also need stability and \r\nsecurity in the world financial markets. The current \r\nturmoil in the world financial markets, if not \r\neffectively addressed soon, threatens to cause \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n29 08-53141 \r\n \r\nwidespread economic downturns than could push \r\nmillions below the poverty line and severely affect the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. To have the world financial \r\ncrisis piling on top of the world energy and food crises \r\nis the last thing that people in the developing countries \r\nwant to see. That is particularly true for people in \r\nThailand and across Asia. Our painful experience has \r\ntaught us how phenomena such as those that started off \r\nas a financial crisis in 1997 can spiral into a \r\nmultifaceted crisis that drove millions of people into \r\nabject poverty and despair, strained the social fabric of \r\nsocieties and created social tensions that developed \r\ninto political ones. \r\n We who lived through those dark days do not \r\nwant to see a repeat of this type of crisis again. All \r\ncountries therefore have a high stake in the current \r\nfinancial turmoil. We must work together, and quickly, \r\nto arrest the downward spiralling effects before it is too \r\nlate. \r\n Besides the perfect storm of this year’s world \r\nenergy, food and financial crises, South-East Asia has \r\nwitnessed a massive storm in the form of Cyclone \r\nNargis, which struck Myanmar in May. Nargis was the \r\nmost devastating cyclone ever to hit Myanmar. Many \r\nlives were lost and many livelihoods were severely \r\naffected. But Nargis was not an isolated case. In the \r\npast few years, we have witnessed a changing climate \r\npattern that has produced successive monster storms \r\nand severe weather in all corners of the world. Ice at \r\nthe North and South Poles is melting at a frightening \r\nspeed. Sea level is rising steadily and threatens to \r\nengulf low-lying areas around the world. Drought has \r\nincreased, and many areas, once arable, have turned \r\ninto desert. \r\n We can no longer turn our eyes away from the \r\ngathering threats posed by climate change. These \r\nthreats recognize no political boundaries. Large and \r\nsmall, powerful and weak, we are all bound together by \r\nour common vulnerability and a common destiny as \r\nresidents of planet Earth. We therefore have a \r\ncollective responsibility on this issue. \r\n The choice is clear and has been made. When the \r\nworld gathered to discuss climate change at the Bali \r\nConference in December last year, the world chose \r\ncollective responsibility over collective irresponsibility. \r\nThailand will spare no effort to work actively with all \r\nparties to ensure that the journey that started under the \r\nBali road map last year can be realized at the \r\nCopenhagen conference scheduled for next year. This \r\nis a critical time that requires critical action by all \r\nparties. Time is simply not on our side. \r\n There is a saying that, in every storm, every \r\ncloud has a silver lining. That is true for the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of \r\nwhich Thailand is a member. Faced with the challenge \r\nof the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, ASEAN had to \r\nmake a choice between doing nothing and losing its \r\ncredibility, or doing something and being seen as a \r\nforce to be reckoned with. ASEAN chose the latter. \r\nActing as a bridge between Myanmar and the \r\ninternational community, ASEAN has successfully \r\nforged a working tripartite partnership between \r\nASEAN, Myanmar and the United Nations. That \r\npartnership has continued to work effectively to this \r\nday and could serve as a model for future humanitarian \r\npartnerships in other parts of the world. Through that \r\nprocess, ASEAN has once again proven its \r\neffectiveness and resilience. \r\n ASEAN has also made another choice — an \r\nimportant and profound one. ASEAN is moving \r\ntowards being a rules-based and people-centred \r\norganization, with the signing of the ASEAN Charter \r\nthis past year. The upcoming fourteenth ASEAN \r\nSummit will take place in Bangkok under the theme \r\n“ASEAN Charter for ASEAN peoples” to mark a new \r\nera for ASEAN, with people at the heart of our \r\ncooperation. As Chairman of ASEAN, Thailand has \r\nlaunched a “three Rs” campaign. First, we want to \r\nrealize the purposes and vision of the Charter. That \r\nincludes the realization of an ASEAN human rights \r\nbody, one of the new organs envisaged in our Charter. \r\nSecondly, we will revitalize the people-centred nature \r\nof our community in order to enhance their \r\nparticipation in building an ASEAN community. \r\nThirdly, we will reinforce ASEAN cooperation to \r\nbetter contribute to the well-being of our peoples, \r\nespecially in the areas of human development and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Thailand will carry forward the work of the \r\nprevious ASEAN Chair, Singapore, to realize the \r\ndream of the ASEAN founding fathers of transforming \r\nSouth-East Asia from a community of good neighbours \r\ninto one ASEAN community, where the feeling of “we \r\nthe peoples of ASEAN” takes root. The world will \r\nbenefit from having a more rules-based, effective, \r\npredictable and people-centred ASEAN as a partner. \r\nThrough greater integration with the regional countries \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 30 \r\n \r\nin Asia, ASEAN can become a natural bridge that \r\nconnects China and India, the two emerging global \r\neconomic centres of the twenty-first century, with a \r\ncombined market size of billions of people. We believe \r\nthat it is not too much or too far-fetched to see a new, \r\nmodern silk road passing through ASEAN. \r\n Allow me to conclude the same way I started. We \r\nneed to reclaim the ideals of “We the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations” in order to work together, to resolve \r\nour common problems and to survive. It has never been \r\nmore imperative for the Members of this Organization \r\nto put aside for a moment our narrow self-interest and \r\ncome together to forge solutions that are in the interest \r\nof us all. The United Nations can only be what the \r\ncollective membership wishes it to be. “We the peoples \r\nof the United Nations” have a choice to make. \r\n Let what one astronaut gazing at planet Earth \r\nfrom a space station once said serve to remind us all of \r\nour collective responsibility: \r\n “For those who have seen the Earth from \r\nspace, and for the hundreds and perhaps \r\nthousands more who will, the experience most \r\ncertainly changes your perspective. The things \r\nthat we share in our world are far more valuable \r\nthan those which divide us.” \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Andrei Dapkiunas, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Belarusian; \r\ninterpretation into Russian provided by the \r\ndelegation): This session’s general political debate and \r\nhigh-level meetings once again convince us of the need \r\nto move in international relations from confrontation \r\nbased on narrow national interests towards equal, \r\nmutually respectful dialogue and cooperation. \r\nOtherwise, it will not be possible to achieve progress in \r\naddressing the urgent global and regional problems \r\nfacing humanity. \r\n The advent of the twenty-first century raised \r\nmany hopes, but thus far the world has not been able to \r\navoid wars as a means of achieving its objectives. \r\nImposing or dictating one’s will and pressure by \r\nindividual States increase conflict and make it difficult \r\nto overcome obstacles. Today, we are dealing with \r\nglobal challenges that not only impede humankind’s \r\ndevelopment but also threaten our civilized existence. \r\nThis situation imposes special responsibilities on all \r\nstakeholders in international relations, irrespective of \r\ntheir geographical location, their geopolitical influence \r\nor their socio-political systems. Equality, \r\nnon-confrontation, mutual respect and proper dialogue: \r\nthose are the keys to overcoming the obstacles to \r\neffective progress on development. \r\n Over recent years, we have often spoken of the \r\nneed to increase the effectiveness of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and its influence on overall global \r\nprocesses. That can be achieved only if each State that \r\nseeks to make its own modest but positive contribution \r\nto addressing global problems can be sure that its \r\napproaches and proposals will be closely and \r\nimpartially studied in the General Assembly. \r\n In the eight years since the Millennium Summit, \r\nwe have seen that the Millennium Development Goals, \r\non which the fate of millions of individuals depends, \r\nwill continue to be mere words on paper if the more \r\ndeveloped States do not cease to view efforts to \r\nestablish the conditions conducive to development in \r\ncountries in the South and to provide those countries \r\nwith financial and economic support from the \r\nperspective of their own geopolitical interests. Let us \r\njust admit honestly that the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment that is mentioned so often in this \r\nAssembly still does not exist in practice. \r\n Unless we deal with the energy and food crises, \r\nwe will not achieve any progress. We must work in the \r\ninterests of all and not serve the wishes of a narrow \r\ngroup of influential countries. We also need to clearly \r\ndetermine how we will target our efforts and act in a \r\nsystematic way. \r\n The challenges we are facing are interrelated: \r\nclimate change and energy and food shortages, to a \r\nlarge extent, are due to existing patterns of energy use. \r\nHumankind has an increasing impact on the \r\natmosphere and the biosphere; environmental problems \r\ndue to the increasing impact of human activity lead to \r\nclimate change; climate change, in turn, leads to \r\nreduced agricultural harvests; and that, in turn, \r\nexacerbates the food crisis. \r\n Thus, we are faced with a single, \r\nmultidimensional global challenge, and the value of \r\nthis session will be magnified if at this international \r\nforum we hear new, justified and forward-thinking \r\nproposals for a coordinated response to the challenges \r\nfacing humankind. Such an approach should undergird \r\nthe work on a post-Kyoto agreement, and today it is \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n31 08-53141 \r\n \r\nclear that talks on that accord must include a broader \r\nrange of issues than simply agreement on quantities \r\nand quotas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n Belarus has stated on many occasions that future \r\napproaches to the problem of how to ensure economic \r\ngrowth while not harming the environment will be \r\nbased on international cooperation to spread \r\nthroughout the world energy-saving technology and \r\ntechnology for the use of alternative and renewable \r\nsources of energy. \r\n An intrinsic, fundamental and vital element of \r\nthat cooperation should be ensuring fair access by all \r\nStates to such technology by establishing, through the \r\nUnited Nations, a global mechanism to control the \r\nprocess. The first step in that direction has been \r\ndefined and can be adopted in the very near future: \r\ntheir Tehran ministerial meeting, on the initiative of \r\nBelarus the non-aligned States proposed holding at the \r\nsixty-third session of the General Assembly a thematic \r\ndebate on ensuring access for all States to energy-\r\nefficient technology and the use of alternative and \r\nrenewable sources of energy — naturally with due \r\nrespect for intellectual property rights. \r\n Particular attention must be paid to establishing a \r\nmultidimensional energy agenda at the United Nations, \r\nwhich should take into account the interests of \r\nproducer, transit and user countries. Responsible \r\nenergy cooperation can be a key factor in regional \r\nsecurity. Turkmenistan’s proposal to discuss ways to \r\nensure reliable transit for fuel is also promising. \r\n In the context of establishing a fair system of \r\ninternational economic relations, particular attention \r\nmust be paid to a code of conduct for transnational \r\ncorporations in exploiting oil and gas fields and the \r\nmineral resources of developing countries. We need \r\nreliable protection against the practice of international \r\noil cartels of finding concessions that are profitable to \r\nthem, but that amount to slavery for the host country. \r\nSuch deals are often challenged, but the oil companies \r\nuse the media to justify their measures, citing threats to \r\nregional security. We look forward to the discussion of \r\nthat important initiative and those issues during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n Indeed, attempts to get access to resources are the \r\nbasic cause of many current conflicts. Here, we are \r\ntalking not only about oil and other energy resources: \r\npeople are also dying because of local conflicts linked \r\nto the lack of drinking water. Given the fact that 97 per \r\ncent of global water resources are found in the oceans \r\nand seas, finding practical ways to desalinate seawater \r\nshould be a priority for scientific research in the \r\ncoming decades. \r\n The United Nations can play a role in defining \r\nthe future of such technology, and we believe that this \r\nshould belong to all mankind. To ensure that, we must \r\nput in place mechanisms to avoid the concentration of \r\nsuch technologies in the hands of a chosen few. One of \r\nthe main keys to successfully addressing global \r\nproblems facing mankind is speedily achieving \r\nagreements and understandings among the whole \r\ninternational community. Any delay in addressing \r\nclimate change is unacceptable, because it affects other \r\nissues on the international agenda. \r\n We believe that one of the main concerns on that \r\nagenda should be human development and the \r\nprevention of exploitation of nations and individuals. A \r\nUnited Nations action plan to fight human trafficking \r\nis an important stage in efforts to counter \r\ncontemporary forms of slavery. Within the United \r\nNations, work on that plan is under way: we have set \r\nup an inter-agency coordination group; resolutions \r\nhave been adopted by the General Assembly and by the \r\nEconomic and Social Council; and we have held \r\nthematic debates in the General Assembly. We call on \r\nall delegations to take an active and constructive role \r\nin that process, which will raise the issue of human \r\ntrafficking to a new level. An inadequate response to \r\nthe threat will promote the exploitation of entire \r\nnations and establish a new chain of human trafficking, \r\nand the number of new slaves will increase. Criminals \r\nwill begin to select the best from among their victims, \r\nand, as a result, there will be growth in colonialist \r\nthinking in the new framework of globalization, which \r\nwould render the problem particularly dangerous. We \r\ndo not have the right to allow such a situation to \r\ndevelop. \r\n From its very beginning, the United Nations was \r\nseen by its founding States as the most democratic of \r\ninternational institutions, a universal mechanism for \r\ninvolving all countries and peoples in establishing a \r\nnew and just world order. As a founding Member of the \r\nUnited Nations, Belarus supports the initiative of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession, Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann, to give particular \r\nattention to the democratization of the Organization. \r\nWe support that process within the United Nations, and \r\nwe support allowing all Member States equal \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 32 \r\n \r\nopportunities and the same rules of the game. We \r\nfavour strict respect for all the principles set out in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. \r\n The results-oriented proposal for democratization \r\nincludes enlarging the membership of the United \r\nNations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic \r\nRadiation. Over the 20 years since the accident at \r\nChernobyl, Belarus has acquired unique experience in \r\nstudying the effects of radiation on individuals and the \r\nenvironment, and we would like to have the \r\nopportunity to share that experience with other States \r\nwithin the framework of the Scientific Committee. We \r\ncall on all States to support the admission of Belarus as \r\na member of the Committee, which was established on \r\nthe recommendation of the First Committee, adopted as \r\nresolution 913 (X), entitled “Effects of atomic radiation”. \r\n We also support efforts to democratize the \r\nSecretariat. The management of each Secretariat \r\ndepartment should respect the principle of equitable \r\ngeographic representation. The top five jobs in each \r\ndepartment should be distributed among the five \r\nregional groups. Establishing that principle will be an \r\nimportant step forward in creating confidence among \r\nMember States. \r\n We hope that we are moving towards several \r\nimportant international events. In Doha, there will be \r\nan international conference on financing for \r\ndevelopment. Work is continuing on a post-Kyoto \r\naccord, and discussions on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil are entering a new phase. Their success \r\ndepends on us all. Will we be able to have a \r\nconstructive dialogue and a non-confrontational \r\napproach and reach a deeper understanding of the real \r\ninterests of all peoples throughout the world than we \r\nhave today? Most answers to those key issues of the \r\ncontemporary world are to be found in our own history. \r\nAll we need to do is look back at our own history and \r\ndraw the right lessons from the past in a timely way. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Peter Maurer, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the Swiss Confederation. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the President of \r\nthe Swiss Confederation, Mr. Pascal Couchepin, who \r\nhad to cancel his trip to New York at the very last \r\nminute. \r\n Since its foundation, the United Nations has \r\nembodied the hope of all people to live in peace, \r\nfreedom and dignity. As Members of the United \r\nNations and as representatives of our peoples, we are \r\nunder an obligation not to disappoint those hopes. \r\nThree years ago in this Hall, we decided in the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome to ensure that human beings \r\nwould live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty \r\nand despair. We ought now to ask ourselves the \r\nfollowing questions: Have we kept that promise? Have \r\nthe expectations been fulfilled? Have we done enough \r\nto bring about peace and security, development and the \r\nrealization of human rights? \r\n According to a recent World Bank report, the \r\nnumber of people living in poverty has fallen by 500 \r\nmillion since 1981. Their proportion of the total \r\npopulation has fallen from 52 to 26 per cent. \r\nNevertheless, 1.2 billion people still have to get by on \r\nless than a dollar a day. Twenty-five thousand people a \r\nday are dying as a result of starvation and poverty. \r\nThere are still 67 million refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons on the planet. No State, however \r\nwealthy or powerful, can tackle all these challenges \r\nalone. Common solutions are required. A strong United \r\nNations is needed, a United Nations that focuses on \r\nthat which unites rather than on that which divides. \r\n Cooperation across cultural and religious borders \r\nis not always easy. Swiss history has shown that this \r\ntype of cooperation is most likely to bear fruit when \r\nspecific problems are tackled and solutions are sought \r\nthrough open dialogue. This approach is reflected in \r\nSwiss peace policy. We support projects the purpose of \r\nwhich is to bring together people with different values \r\nand cultural backgrounds to enable them to coexist in a \r\npositive way. This approach also characterizes our \r\nactivity in the United Nations-sponsored Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. \r\n Although dialogue is necessary, it is nevertheless \r\nonly one of the means of promoting the fundamental \r\nvalues to which we are all devoted. I am thinking first \r\nand foremost of human rights, access to a decent \r\nstandard of living and personal development for \r\neveryone. \r\n In this context, Switzerland is participating \r\nactively in the work of the Human Rights Council. Let \r\nus recall that the usefulness of the Council will \r\nultimately be judged by the specific contribution that it \r\nmakes to the protection of human rights on the ground. \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n33 08-53141 \r\n \r\nThe Universal Periodic Review and its special \r\nprocedures provide the Council with two effective \r\ntools, and those tools must be used. Switzerland will \r\ncontinue to advocate in favour of a constructive and \r\ncritical Universal Periodic Review, the independence \r\nof special procedures and the autonomy of the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights. \r\n Next year, the Review Conference on the \r\nimplementation of the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action will take place at Durban. For \r\nSwitzerland, the fight against racism is a priority. That \r\nis why my country will play its part in this process. \r\nHowever, we expect the preparatory phase to be \r\ncharacterized by a constructive spirit that helps us \r\nachieve a balanced outcome. In particular, the Review \r\nConference should confine itself to the evaluation of \r\nthe implementation of the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action. It should not call into question \r\nthe normative advances set out in the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination. And finally, it should deal with \r\ndifferent subjects relating to racism in a balanced \r\nmanner, without becoming a platform that focuses on a \r\nparticular situation. \r\n Last week, the Assembly also discussed the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWe all know that the implementation of the Goals is \r\nslow and arduous. Collectively, we could have done \r\nmore. We should have done more, and Switzerland is \r\nno exception. But we are trying to assign our limited \r\nresources to actions that meet the needs of recipients, \r\nthat make a difference to the poorest, that help people \r\nto help themselves and that complement, but do not \r\nreplace, the efforts of recipient countries. \r\n Development assistance should be characterized \r\nby lasting effectiveness and coherence. The Follow-Up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, to be held in Doha, will give us an \r\nopportunity to renew and to deepen this alliance \r\nbetween developing and industrialized countries. \r\n Progress towards the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals requires that the \r\nworld’s poorest be better protected legally. Only if they \r\ncan defend themselves against injustice and have equal \r\naccess to justice, property, work and markets will \r\ndevelopment ultimately be possible. The Commission \r\non Legal Empowerment of the Poor presented its report \r\na few months ago. It deserves careful study and follow-\r\nup by the Assembly. \r\n The food crisis has undoubtedly made achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals more difficult. \r\nLike some other countries, Switzerland has responded \r\nto the crisis by increasing its contribution to the World \r\nFood Programme. But the causes of food price rises \r\nalso need to be addressed. The causes are diverse and \r\nrange from changing eating habits to increased \r\ncultivation of agrofuel crops and neglect of agricultural \r\nproduction. Measures to resolve this crisis will have to \r\nbe both numerous and varied. In this regard, we \r\nwelcome the efforts made by the High-Level Task \r\nForce on the Global Food Security Crisis in providing \r\na coherent and efficient response. \r\n However, there is also a positive side to this \r\ncrisis. Rising food prices may also represent an \r\nopportunity for farmers in developing countries. But \r\nfor farmers to benefit from the rise in food prices they \r\nneed access to land and property, financing and seed. \r\nLikewise, they need international rules against the \r\nflooding of their sales markets by subsidized \r\nagricultural products, as well as better access to the \r\nmarkets of industrialized countries. \r\n A positive conclusion of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) discussions could have been a \r\npositive sign of movement in this direction. \r\nSwitzerland therefore regrets that it was not possible to \r\nreach agreement at the Ministerial Meeting held in \r\nGeneva in July. The challenge now is to ensure that the \r\nprogress already made is not jeopardized and that \r\nconfidence among WTO member States is restored, so \r\nthat the Doha Round can be brought to a successful \r\nconclusion. \r\n Climate change is another major source of \r\nconcern. We in Switzerland are particularly aware of \r\nthis fact because our alpine glaciers are rapidly melting \r\naway. In other parts of the world, this phenomenon \r\ntakes the form of changing precipitation patterns, \r\ndroughts and floods. The reports of the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \r\nclearly show that all these disasters have a point in \r\ncommon: they are the result of climate change and are \r\ncaused by human beings, and particularly by the \r\nconsumption of fossil fuels. \r\n The time for never-ending talks has passed. \r\nSwitzerland will achieve its emissions reduction goals \r\nfor 2012. For the years after 2012, we need a new, \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 34 \r\n \r\nambitious and internationally accepted climate regime. \r\nSuch a regime should be based on the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. Switzerland \r\nhas put forward a proposal for a global carbon dioxide \r\ntax which meets that criterion and would ensure the \r\nfinancing of the necessary adaptation measures. I \r\nwould like to invite the Assembly to carefully study \r\nthis proposal in the framework of the ongoing climate \r\ndiscussions. \r\n The efforts of the industrialized countries alone \r\nwill not be enough, however, to solve the problem of \r\nglobal warming. Each country will, according to its \r\nown capacities, have to contribute to the reduction of \r\nCO2 emissions. In so doing, we are united by a \r\ncommon concern: that of shouldering our responsibility \r\nto future generations. \r\n Today, many countries are still in situations of \r\narmed conflict. In many cases, respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law has declined. That is why \r\nSwitzerland calls again on all conflicting parties to \r\ncomply with the provisions of international \r\nhumanitarian law and to guarantee humanitarian \r\norganizations swift and unhindered access to the \r\nvictims of conflicts. \r\n Conflict prevention is one of the central tasks of \r\nthe United Nations. Switzerland is particularly active \r\non two levels. First, we wish to pay closer attention to \r\nthe connection between armed violence and \r\ndevelopment. Together with other partners, we intend \r\nto submit a draft resolution on this subject during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Secondly, we \r\nstrongly advocate the strengthening of the Secretariat’s \r\nmediation capacities. The mediation efforts in Kenya, \r\nfor instance, have demonstrated that this form of \r\nconflict prevention can work. \r\n That brings me to the subjects of the \r\nresponsibility to protect and of prevention of genocide. \r\nSwitzerland welcomes the fact that these subjects have \r\nbeen institutionally anchored more firmly within the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The concept of the responsibility to protect was \r\nrecognized in September 2005 in the framework of the \r\nWorld Summit. It is obvious that the operational \r\nimplementation of the concept can only be realized \r\nprogressively. Nevertheless, Switzerland will commit \r\nto ensuring that the concept is not partially assimilated \r\ninto that of humanitarian intervention, thereby calling \r\ninto question the consensus achieved in 2005. \r\n Justice is necessary for building lasting peace. In \r\nother words, peace and impunity are incompatible in \r\nthe long term. The arrest and extradition of Charles \r\nTaylor and Radovan Karadzic to The Hague have once \r\nagain confirmed the importance of international \r\ncriminal justice. Alleged war criminals must not be \r\nallowed to live in serenity. They must answer for their \r\nacts in a fair trial. That is the preventive effect of the \r\ninternational criminal justice system, and it should not \r\nbe underestimated. Switzerland therefore supports the \r\nwork of the International Criminal Court and advocates \r\nits independence. \r\n At the beginning of my speech, I stressed the \r\ngreat importance of the United Nations. The world is \r\nchanging, however, and international relations are \r\nconstantly developing. The United Nations will also \r\nhave to change. Those who focus only on the past will \r\nno doubt miss the future. \r\n There is a need for reform in all United Nations \r\nbodies, but particularly in the Security Council. Given \r\nthe power that it exerts, the expectations of the \r\nSecurity Council are very high. If its decisions are to \r\nbe accepted and supported by the entire international \r\ncommunity, the Council will need to adapt to the \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century, namely, the new \r\nbalances that characterize our world at the political, \r\neconomic and demographic levels. \r\n Moreover, it is important that the views of \r\nimportant actors that are not members of the Council \r\nshould be better taken into account in decision-making. \r\nSwitzerland has for some time advocated an \r\nimprovement of the Council’s working methods and \r\nwill continue to work for greater participation and \r\ntransparency. \r\n Peace is not a given. It is an ideal that has to be \r\npursued every day. The United Nations is the \r\npredestined venue for achieving that goal. We are \r\nwilling, within our capacities, to make our contribution \r\nto that pressing collective task. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Mr. Somduth Soborun, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Mauritius. \r\n Mr. Soborun (Mauritius): I stand in for The \r\nHonourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Mauritius, who is not able to be \r\npersonally present to address this Assembly at this \r\nsession. The Prime Minister has asked me, on his \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n35 08-53141 \r\n \r\nbehalf to make this statement and to convey his kind \r\ngreetings to President D’Escoto Brockmann; to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim; and our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\n The problems we face are many and daunting, but \r\nwe believe that humankind has the ingenuity and \r\nresources to overcome adversity through a unified \r\nresponse. The goal of promoting human development \r\nand security, in all its manifold aspects, should remain \r\nour priority. In that regard, the theme of this session — \r\n“The impact of the global food crisis on poverty and \r\nhunger and the need to democratize the United \r\nNations” — is both timely and relevant. \r\n We are all affected by the growing global food \r\ncrisis. As always, the brunt of food insecurity is borne \r\nby Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, where riots and \r\nstrikes have occurred and social unrest threatens \r\npolitical stability. Admittedly, a number of factors \r\nunderlie the present scarcity of food. Some of those \r\nfactors are beyond our control. However, there is an \r\nurgent need for us to address such issues as outdated \r\nagricultural practices, inadequate infrastructure, the \r\ninequitable distribution of land ownership and \r\ninsecurity of tenure. The list is long. The remedies are \r\nknown. Hopefully, we can bring to bear the political \r\nwill that is required. \r\n Mauritius is a net food importing country. To \r\nreduce our dependence on food imports, the \r\nGovernment is implementing a plan to maximize food \r\nproduction. We are optimizing land use and \r\ndiversifying the production of food crops, livestock \r\nand seafood. To overcome the constraints of land \r\navailability and take advantage of economies of scale, \r\nwe aim, in partnership with neighbouring countries, to \r\nproduce for our common domestic markets and \r\neventually for exports to the region. Our experiments \r\nin that respect with Madagascar and Mozambique are \r\nproving to be mutually beneficial and hold great \r\npromise for the future. \r\n The right to food is one that is very often \r\noverlooked, and yet it is intimately connected to human \r\ndignity. It is important that the international \r\ncommunity act now to ensure that this fundamental \r\nhuman right is respected. In this era of scientific and \r\ntechnological prowess, when we are unravelling the \r\nmysteries of the immensities of the universe and \r\nsubatomic particles, and when the discoveries of \r\nscience daily amaze us and change our perceptions of \r\nreality, it is unconscionable that countless children \r\nshould sleep on an empty stomach. One out of every \r\nsix persons in the world suffers from hunger. That is \r\nthe greatest moral challenge facing humanity today. \r\n We commend the Secretary-General for the \r\ntimely establishment of the High-level Task Force on \r\nthe Global Food Security Crisis. We also welcome the \r\nrecent proposal by the European Commission to create \r\na special facility amounting to more than $1.5 billion \r\nfor a rapid response to food crises, in coordination with \r\nthe United Nations Task Force and international \r\norganizations. \r\n Over a period of almost one year, the \r\nunprecedented level of the price of oil has dealt a \r\nsevere blow to the economic growth of many \r\ndeveloping countries. Mauritius depends on imported \r\noil for 80 per cent of its energy consumption, which \r\nmakes it extremely vulnerable on that count. The share \r\nof petroleum products in our import bill went up from \r\n12 per cent in 2000 to 18 per cent in 2007. We have \r\nrecently set up the “Maurice Ile Durable” project to \r\nencourage more efficient use of energy and to tap \r\nrenewable energy sources. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The Maurice Ile Durable project is bold, but we \r\nbelieve that the current global situation calls for \r\nboldness. The prime objective of the project is to strike \r\na balance between our economic, environmental and \r\nsocial needs. Last year, we achieved a 5.4 per cent \r\ngrowth rate increase and this year we forecast a rate of \r\nmore than 5.7 per cent. However, we realize that \r\ngrowth is not an end in itself. \r\n The Government is pursuing a model of \r\ndevelopment that takes into account not only economic \r\nimperatives, but also the deep-seated aspirations of \r\neach Mauritian citizen. At the same time, we cannot \r\nallow ourselves to compromise the opportunities for \r\nfuture generations. \r\n The Maurice Ile Durable project seeks to make \r\nMauritius a fully-fledged laboratory. We will use the \r\nnatural resources with which our island is so liberally \r\nendowed — the sea, the sun, the wind and a rich plant \r\nbiomass. We seek an environmental solution to the \r\nproblem of global warming and to our dependence on \r\nthe extremely volatile hydrocarbons market. We have \r\nset ourselves the target of reducing our dependence of \r\npetroleum-based products by two thirds within \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 36 \r\n \r\n20 years. This is how we are contributing to \r\ninternational efforts to combat the greenhouse effect. It \r\nis the wager for the future of a very vulnerable small \r\nisland economy, but I want to believe that it is also the \r\nobjective of a planet threatened with suffocation on the \r\nlong term. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n While the causes of food insecurity and the \r\nenergy crisis are multiple and complex, there is little \r\ndoubt that climate change will exacerbate the situation \r\nin the future. Climate change places a particular burden \r\non developing countries, which have done the least to \r\ncause the problem. Developing countries are in dire \r\nneed of assistance to enhance their adaptive capacity \r\nand minimize their vulnerability because, on their own, \r\nthey cannot bear the burden of the costs of mitigation \r\nand adaptation. \r\n As an island, Mauritius is especially vulnerable to \r\nthe effects of climate change, sea-level rise, beach \r\nerosion, coral bleaching and extreme weather \r\nconditions. They not only affect our local resources \r\nand industries such as fisheries and tourism, but also \r\nthreaten vital infrastructure, settlements and services. \r\nThe increased frequency and scale of natural disasters \r\nexacerbate our inherent vulnerability. \r\n Mauritius is fully engaged in the post-Bali \r\nprocess. The meetings to be held in Poznan in \r\nDecember and in Copenhagen next year will be crucial \r\nto determining emission targets. It is vital that we reach \r\na comprehensive agreement on a climate change \r\nframework. At the last high-level meeting on climate \r\nchange, Mauritius made a plea for the creation of a \r\nspecial fund to enable the development and \r\nimplementation of adaptation measures. Our appeal to \r\ninternational donors to provide the much-needed \r\nresources for operating the fund is yet to be answered. \r\nHowever, we welcome the recent declaration by the \r\nleaders of the Group of Eight of a long-term emissions \r\nreduction target of at least 50 per cent by 2050. We \r\nalso welcome their undertaking to help support the \r\nmitigation plans of major developing countries through \r\ntechnology transfer and capacity-building. \r\n Small island developing States are innocent \r\nvictims of global warming and the degradation of the \r\nenvironment. Only a few weeks ago, we witnessed the \r\ndevastation caused by a quick succession of hurricanes \r\nin the Caribbean. We therefore call on the international \r\ncommunity to assist small island developing States to \r\nincorporate adaptation and mitigation plans into their \r\nnational strategies. Continued access to official \r\ndevelopment assistance, concessionary financing \r\narrangements, the reduction of debt servicing and \r\nimproved terms of trade are crucial to building up the \r\neconomic resilience of small island developing States. \r\n We are particularly concerned about the \r\ninadequate level of implementation of the Barbados \r\nPlan of Action and the Mauritius Strategy. We reiterate \r\nour request to the international community to honour \r\nthe offers of assistance made during the international \r\nconference on small island developing States held in \r\nMauritius in 2005. Furthermore, the arbitrary gross \r\ndomestic product criteria applied to determine the \r\neligibility for securing concessionary finance \r\ndisqualify most small island developing States from \r\naccessing much-needed funds for important \r\ninfrastructure development. It is absolutely necessary \r\nin that regard that small island developing States be \r\ntreated as a distinct category. \r\n More than halfway through, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal (MDG) track record is mixed. Some \r\ndeveloping countries are on target while others, \r\nparticularly from the African continent, are facing \r\ncrippling difficulties. Even the gains painstakingly \r\nachieved in fighting hunger and poverty are tenuous \r\nand could be nullified by the current food and energy \r\ncrisis. It is vital that donors and development partners \r\nhonour the pledges made in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, the 2002 Monterrey International \r\nConference on Financing for Development and the \r\n2005 World Summit. \r\n Mauritius is on track to meet the MDG targets. \r\nEfforts are under way in all key socio-economic sectors \r\nto further improve living standards and to achieve the \r\nMDGs as early as possible. We are addressing poverty \r\nin a comprehensive and coherent manner, convinced \r\nthat it will have a positive impact on the other \r\ndevelopment goals. Our experience has demonstrated \r\nthat the most effective remedy to poverty is inclusive \r\neconomic growth. \r\n The Government is pursuing a number of \r\nprogrammes announced in its latest budget to eliminate \r\nabsolute poverty. We have introduced an Eradication of \r\nAbsolute Poverty Programme, which comprises a \r\nnumber of integrated development projects within \r\nidentified pockets of poverty. We have also put in place \r\na Human Resource Development, Knowledge and Arts \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n37 08-53141 \r\n \r\nFund to ensure that university studies become \r\naffordable to all. We aim to double enrolment in \r\ntertiary education by 2015. \r\n In April, Mauritius hosted the Southern Africa \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) International \r\nConference on Poverty and Development. I am happy \r\nto inform the Assembly that the Conference formulated \r\na regional strategy for poverty eradication in the SADC \r\ncountries. The SADC secretariat has taken follow-up \r\naction on the development of an implementation plan. \r\nIn line with one of the Conference recommendations, a \r\njoint ministerial task force on food security, comprising \r\nthe ministers of finance, trade and agriculture, met in \r\nLusaka on 13 July 2008 to tackle the food crisis \r\naffecting the region. \r\n Africa’s development needs were debated at the \r\nhighest level on Monday, 22 September. Concrete and \r\nconcerted action on the part of African States and their \r\ncooperation partners is called for to help achieve \r\nsustained and sustainable development on the \r\ncontinent. Furthermore, we look forward to the \r\nforthcoming Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development in Doha. It will be a unique \r\nopportunity to address the various facets of \r\nconcessionary financing and to find new resources for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n More important, the Doha Development Agenda \r\nshould deliver on its promise of development through \r\nincreased trading opportunities as a means of \r\neradicating poverty. With regard to the World Trade \r\nOrganization negotiations, we join those who have \r\ncalled for the talks to progress on the basis of what has \r\nalready been achieved. We remain fully committed to \r\nthe Doha Development Agenda and will contribute \r\nconstructively to the negotiations. \r\n We support the effective and quick \r\nimplementation of the Aid for Trade Initiative, which \r\nshould take into account the priorities and needs of \r\nbeneficiary countries. At present, our limited industrial \r\ncapacity prevents us from taking full advantage of the \r\nopportunities offered by globalization. On the regional \r\nfront, I am pleased to say that we have made major \r\nstrides in our integration process. The SADC Free \r\nTrade Area was launched on 17 August 2008, and we \r\nare aiming to fully liberalize trade by 2012. \r\n Since the adoption of the 2001 Declaration of \r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (resolution S-26/2), \r\nincreasing numbers of people have gained access to \r\nHIV prevention and treatment in low- and middle-\r\nincome countries. However, many countries still have a \r\nlong way to go to meet the goal we set ourselves under \r\nMDG 6 of achieving universal access to HIV \r\nprevention, treatment, care and support by 2010. The \r\nhigh prevalence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa \r\ncontinues to be a cause for alarm. \r\n Engagement at the highest level is vital in the \r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. The Mauritius National AIDS \r\nCommittee, under the chairmanship of The Honourable \r\nPrime Minister, oversees the implementation of a \r\nmultisectoral HIV and AIDS strategic plan. That plan \r\nprovides for antiretroviral treatment free of charge to \r\nall HIV-infected persons, voluntary counselling and \r\ntesting service and the implementation of a mother-to-\r\nchild transmission prevention programme. The \r\nGovernment has also increased the amount allocated to \r\nthe fight against HIV/AIDS by 50 per cent in the \r\ncurrent budget. \r\n As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nin December, we must remain unwavering in our \r\nresolve to promote and protect human rights. Much \r\nremains to be done to ensure that the basic rights of \r\nindividuals are universally protected. The Mauritian \r\nConstitution guarantees that our citizens enjoy \r\nfundamental rights in their everyday lives. The \r\nNational Human Rights Commission, the Human \r\nRights Centre, the Parliamentary Commission for the \r\nDemocratization of the Economy and the proposed \r\nEqual Opportunities Act are important mechanisms for \r\nthe protection and promotion of human rights in our \r\ncountry. \r\n As an advocate of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, Mauritius severely condemns \r\nthe decision of Myanmar’s military junta to prolong the \r\nhouse arrest of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. My delegation \r\nbelieves that the national reconciliation and full \r\ndemocratization of Myanmar cannot be achieved \r\nwithout the release of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and other \r\npolitical detainees and without the participation of the \r\nNational League for Democracy in the political \r\nprocess. \r\n Situations of conflict and war inevitably give rise \r\nto violations of human rights and to atrocities against \r\ninnocent civilians. Displacement and violent death \r\ncontinue to be the lot of far too many in parts of the \r\nMiddle East, Africa and Asia. Mauritius has always \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 38 \r\n \r\nsupported the struggle of the Palestinian people and \r\ntheir inalienable right to self-determination. We favour \r\nthe creation of a Palestinian State coexisting with the \r\nState of Israel within secure and recognized borders. It \r\nis through dialogue, negotiations and compromise by \r\nboth sides that lasting peace can come about in the \r\nMiddle East. \r\n The deteriorating humanitarian situation in \r\nDarfur remains a matter of grave concern for my \r\ndelegation. We urge all parties involved in the conflict, \r\nespecially the authorities, to exercise restraint in their \r\nactions and to move towards a just and lasting solution \r\nto the conflict. We welcome the power-sharing accord \r\nreached in Zimbabwe. We hope that a Government of \r\nnational unity will bring peace, stability and \r\nreconciliation to the Zimbabwean people, who have \r\nsuffered for far too long the brutal consequences of the \r\npolitical crisis and economic meltdown. \r\n The grave and pervasive threat of terrorism \r\nknows no boundaries; no country is shielded from its \r\npernicious and devastating impact. Mauritius is \r\ncommitted to the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy. It is imperative that we conclude a \r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism as soon as \r\npossible to reinforce the existing legal framework. In \r\nJune 2008, as part of its contribution to the \r\ninternational efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations, Mauritius joined the Global \r\nInitiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. \r\n We fully share the view of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly regarding the democratization of our \r\nOrganization. The ongoing discussions on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, system-wide \r\ncoherence, mandate review and management reform in \r\nthe context of the United Nations reform process \r\nshould be aimed at strengthening multilateralism. We \r\nneed comprehensive reform of the Security Council so \r\nthat it is able to meet the needs and respond to the \r\naspirations of the increasingly changing political \r\nrealities of the world. \r\n We call for expansion of the Security Council in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent membership \r\ncategories and for improvement in its working \r\nmethods. Mauritius remains firmly committed to the \r\nEzulwini Consensus, which calls for two seats in the \r\npermanent category and five non-permanent seats for \r\nAfrica. I should like to reaffirm once again the \r\nunequivocal support of Mauritius for India to be a \r\npermanent member of a reformed Security Council. We \r\nalso reaffirm our support for a Latin American and \r\nCaribbean country to be a permanent member of a \r\nreformed Council. Furthermore, we welcome the recent \r\nunanimous decision of the General Assembly to start \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform in an informal plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly by the end of February 2009. \r\n The principles and objectives enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations should continue to guide \r\nus in our actions. I would like to bring up once again \r\nbefore the Assembly our legitimate sovereignty claim \r\nregarding the Chagos Archipelago, including \r\nDiego Garcia. The Archipelago was excised from the \r\nterritory of Mauritius by the United Kingdom prior to \r\nour independence, in disregard of General Assembly \r\nresolutions 1514 (XV) of 1960 and 2066 (XX) of 1965. \r\nWe have always favoured a settlement of the issue \r\nthrough constructive bilateral dialogue. In that regard, I \r\nwish to inform the Assembly that high-level talks are \r\nunder way. \r\n The Government is very sensitive to the \r\naspirations of citizens of Mauritius to return to the \r\nislands of their birth in the Chagos Archipelago. I wish \r\nto recall here that they were forcibly removed from the \r\nArchipelago prior to its excision from Mauritius. \r\nLikewise, we urge France to pursue dialogue with \r\nMauritius on the issue of Tromelin. It is our firm \r\nconviction that such bilateral dialogue will further \r\nconsolidate our historical and friendly relations with \r\nboth the United Kingdom and France. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the United \r\nNations remains the most important and credible \r\ninternational multilateral Organization for the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security and for building a \r\nbetter and safer world. The President of the General \r\nAssembly can rest assured of our unwavering support \r\nin the work of the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ahmed Khaleel, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Maldives. \r\n Mr. Khaleel (Maldives): I am delivering this \r\nstatement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Abdulla \r\nShahid, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Maldives, \r\nwho, unfortunately, had to cancel his trip to New York \r\nat the last minute owing to various pressing \r\nengagements at home. \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n39 08-53141 \r\n \r\n Permit me to begin by expressing my delegation’s \r\nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I assure him of the \r\nfull support and cooperation of my delegation in his \r\nwork. I should also like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our profound appreciation to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for the exemplary manner in which \r\nhe guided the work of the Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession. In addition, I should like to offer my \r\ndelegation’s heartfelt gratitude to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his inspiring leadership and \r\ndedication in promoting the noble principles and ideals \r\nof this Organization. \r\n Four years ago, the people of the Maldives \r\nembarked on a comprehensive reform programme \r\naimed at strengthening and modernizing democratic \r\ngovernance in the country. Within that short period of \r\ntime, unprecedented reforms have been adopted and \r\nthe political landscape of the country has been \r\ncompletely transformed. \r\n A new Constitution that fully guarantees the civil \r\nliberties and fundamental freedoms of our people was \r\nadopted on 7 August 2008. To safeguard the \r\nfoundations of democracy on our islands, several \r\noversight bodies — a National Human Rights \r\nCommission that complies with the Paris Principles, a \r\nJudicial Service Commission and an independent \r\nElections Commission — have been established and \r\nare now operational. Significant progress is also being \r\nmade in reforming and restructuring the legal and \r\njudicial system of the country to align it with \r\ninternationally accepted norms and standards. \r\n In accordance with the new Constitution, the \r\nMaldives will hold its first multiparty presidential \r\nelection early next week. Parliamentary elections will \r\nbe held before the end of February and local municipal \r\nelections will be completed by July next year. \r\n Those gains were made with the help of the \r\ninternational community, particularly the Commonwealth, \r\nthe European Union and the United Nations. I thank them \r\nfor their invaluable support, encouragement and \r\nassistance in implementing the reform programme. My \r\nGovernment is also extremely grateful to those \r\norganizations for accepting our request for election \r\nmonitoring and assistance in the electoral process. We \r\nare firm in our resolve that the elections shall be held \r\nin a free and fair manner in full conformity with \r\ninternationally recognized standards and best practice. \r\n When the Maldives joined the United Nations in \r\n1965, we were one of the smallest and poorest States \r\nMembers of this Organization. We lacked even the \r\nmost basic political, legal and economic infrastructure \r\nand institutions necessary for self-governance. Our \r\nability to provide for the welfare of our people was \r\nextremely limited. The economy was based largely on \r\nsubsistence fishery, and the health and education \r\nsectors were severely underdeveloped. However, since \r\nthen, the Maldives has achieved remarkable levels of \r\nsocio-economic progress. Thirty years of strong and \r\nunwavering political leadership, complemented by the \r\nhard work of our people and the generous assistance of \r\nour development partners, have enabled the country \r\nsuccessfully to pursue a people-centred path of \r\nsustainable development, based on social equity and \r\njustice. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \r\nnow fully incorporated into our national development \r\npriorities, and I am happy to note that we are among \r\nthose countries that are on track to achieve most of the \r\nMDGs by 2015. We believe that the ongoing political, \r\nlegal and human rights reform agenda will further \r\nstrengthen our progress and propel us to new heights of \r\nsocio-economic development, with the support of our \r\npartners. \r\n As a result of our rapid development progress, \r\nfour years ago the Assembly decided to graduate the \r\nMaldives from the list of least developed countries. \r\nThe Maldives is also being hailed by the international \r\ncommunity as a major success story of the multilateral \r\ndevelopment assistance framework. \r\n And yet those hard-won achievements will be \r\nrendered meaningless if MDG 7 — environmental \r\nsustainability — cannot be guaranteed. It is now \r\naccepted beyond any doubt that climate change poses \r\nthe most immediate and far-reaching threat to human \r\nsecurity, directly compromising the most fundamental \r\nrights, including the right to self-determination and the \r\nright to life itself, for millions of people around the \r\nworld. \r\n From the highest Himalayan peaks to the low-\r\nlying coastal areas and small islands a metre or so \r\nabove sea level, global warming and changing weather \r\npatterns are undermining the lives and livelihoods of \r\nmillions of people around the planet, with the poor \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 40 \r\n \r\nbeing especially vulnerable. The recent hurricanes that \r\nleft such a trail of destruction across the Caribbean \r\nonce again brought into sharp relief the acute \r\nvulnerabilities of small island States, such as the \r\nMaldives, to global warming and climate change. \r\n For the Maldives, climate change is not a distant \r\npossibility. It is happening now and is a reality that we \r\nare experiencing on a daily basis. The continuing \r\ndegradation of the global environment is not only \r\nundermining our development process, but also \r\nseriously threatening the very survival of our people \r\nand the existence of our tiny country. \r\n We are all aware of the grim predictions in the \r\nfourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change. If those predictions were to \r\ncome true, the Maldives and many other small island \r\ndeveloping States and low-lying coastal areas would \r\ncease to exist within a relatively short period of time. \r\n Hence, the Maldives and many other small island \r\ndeveloping States do not have the luxury of hesitation \r\nand inaction, nor can we afford to pick and choose \r\nwhere and when that important issue needs to be \r\naddressed. For us, it is not solely a development issue, \r\nbut also a moral, ethical, political, legal and human \r\nrights issue, as well as a grave security issue. \r\n That is why the President of the Maldives took \r\nthe initiative in 1987 to raise that issue before the \r\nAssembly. That is also why the Maldives participated \r\nin the Security Council debate on the issue last year, \r\nand why the Maldives decided to raise the issue before \r\nthe Human Rights Council in 2008. \r\n The inverse relationship between responsibility \r\nfor climate change and vulnerability to its \r\nconsequences is often overlooked. The Maldives and \r\nother small island developing States contribute the \r\nleast to global warming, and yet their development \r\nand, indeed, their very existence are fundamentally \r\nthreatened by global warming and its consequences. \r\n Addressing the injustices of climate change is \r\ntherefore the moral and ethical responsibility of the \r\nentire international community. It is time that we put \r\npeople back in the climate change debate. We believe \r\nthat a comprehensive rights-based approach to \r\nsustainable and just development, anchored in the \r\nconcept of common but differentiated responsibility, is \r\nnow an imperative. \r\n In that regard, we are happy that, at the initiative \r\nof the Maldives and 80 other like-minded countries, the \r\nUnited Nations Human Rights Council for the first \r\ntime, earlier this year, recognized the link between \r\nhuman rights and climate change. The Council will \r\nformally debate the issue at its tenth session in March \r\n2009, and we hope that due consideration will be given \r\nto the outcome of the debate by our colleagues in the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange as they work to ensure an effective and \r\nequitable successor to the Kyoto Protocol. \r\n The Maldives is encouraged by the renewed \r\ninternational impetus towards a more sustained and \r\nrobust approach to achieving the MDGs. Indeed, the \r\nhigh-level event on the MDGs held last week clearly \r\nillustrates the collective commitment and interest of \r\nthe international community to work towards achieving \r\nthose Goals. The interrelationship between climate \r\nchange, food security and the attainment of the MDGs \r\ncannot be overemphasized. It is now believed that the \r\nglobal food and energy crisis will drive more than \r\n100 million more people into poverty. \r\n While short-term measures may ease the \r\nimmediate pressures, we believe that a sustainable \r\nsolution to the problem lies in a fair and equitable \r\ntrading regime and a shared vision of partnership and \r\ncooperation. The early and successful completion of \r\nthe Doha Development Round and the successful \r\noutcome of the post-Bali negotiations, as well as the \r\nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to be held in Qatar at the end of this year \r\nwill prove critical in that regard. \r\n As a country that depends on importing most of \r\nits food and all of its energy resources, the Maldives is \r\nextremely concerned about the rise in global food and \r\nenergy prices. Although the situation in the Maldives at \r\npresent is relatively stable, the potential of a severe \r\nblow to our economy is alarmingly high. The \r\nGovernment is fully aware of the risks involved and is \r\ntaking all necessary precautionary measures to ensure \r\nthat the crisis does not adversely affect the daily lives \r\nand well-being of our people. \r\n Organized crime and terrorism are continuing to \r\nthreaten the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. The recent bombings in India and Pakistan are \r\nyet another tragic reminder of the evil and insidious \r\nnature of terrorism. It is therefore important for the \r\ninternational community to ensure that the war against \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n41 08-53141 \r\n \r\nterrorism remains a main priority on the international \r\nagenda.  \r\n The continued scourge of terrorism is particularly \r\nalarming when seen in the context of the spread of \r\nnuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. \r\nThe threat of a terrorist organization gaining access to \r\nsuch weapons is extremely alarming. \r\n I am happy to note that the Maldives is now party \r\nto almost all the international conventions on counter-\r\nterrorism. Despite its limited resource and expertise, \r\nthe Maldives has been actively working towards \r\nimplementing its various regional and multilateral \r\nobligations under the international counter-terrorism \r\nregime. I would therefore like to take this opportunity \r\nto reiterate our commitment to combating global \r\nterrorism and to Security Council resolutions 1373 \r\n(2001) and 1540 (2004) in particular. \r\n A permanent and lasting resolution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine remains elusive. The Maldives \r\nreiterates its support for the right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to self-determination and to an independent and \r\nsovereign homeland. We believe that the two-State \r\nsolution remains the only viable option and needs to be \r\npursued with greater vigour and vitality. \r\n The United Nations in the twenty-first century \r\nmust have the ability to take on emerging challenges in \r\nan expeditious and efficient manner. While we applaud \r\nthe present efforts to reform and revitalize the \r\nOrganization, we believe that such reforms cannot be \r\nsuccessfully achieved without the much-anticipated \r\nreform of the Security Council. In that regard, we are \r\nhappy that the Assembly has decided to proceed to \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in early 2009. We look \r\nforward to participating in those negotiations. \r\n Despite the criticisms levelled against the United \r\nNations, my country remains convinced that the \r\nOrganization is the most potent and credible universal \r\ninstitution today. For the past six decades, the United \r\nNations has been a beacon of hope for peoples around \r\nthe world. Its universal character and the \r\nmultilateralism that it embodies hold true to the ideals \r\nand virtues upon which it was founded and, without a \r\ndoubt, provide the only viable framework for solving \r\nthe world’s great challenges, including climate change, \r\nsustainable development, human rights and global \r\nterrorism. \r\n I therefore reaffirm the Maldives’ commitment to \r\nthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \r\nI offer our full support to the United Nations in its \r\nresolute efforts to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity and to work towards the betterment of all \r\nhumanity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Abderrahim Ould \r\nHadrami, Chairman of the delegation of Mauritania. \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nArabic): It is with pleasure that I offer Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann my warmest congratulations on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session. We have every confidence in his \r\nexceptional skill and future success in consolidating \r\nthe gains achieved and in enhancing international \r\npeace and security in a world system characterized by \r\nprosperity, stability and progress. I would also like to pay \r\ntribute to the valuable efforts made by his predecessor, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, to strengthen the principles of dialogue \r\nand consultation as a means to reach effective solutions \r\nto international issues and disputes. I would further \r\nlike to express our thanks and gratitude to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his continual efforts on \r\nimportant issues relevant to reforming the Organization \r\nand to enhancing international peace and security. \r\n The current session of the Assembly is convening \r\nat a time when our country, Mauritania, has undergone \r\na change of head of State. I would like to seize this \r\nopportunity to explain the reasons for that change. \r\n In August 2005, after two decades of political \r\ntyranny, bribery and increasing corruption, the armed \r\nforces and security forces intervened to put an end to \r\nthe grave abuses that threatened the structure and very \r\nexistence of the Mauritanian State. That move by the \r\nMilitary Council for Justice and Democracy led to a \r\ntransitional democratic phase, which successfully \r\nconcluded in April 2007. Mauritanians and \r\ninternational observers alive attested to the fairness and \r\ntransparency of that phase. The Mauritanian \r\nexperiment in democracy became an example worthy \r\nof emulation. The satisfaction of various national and \r\ninternational observers and the support of civil society \r\nadded to the success of the experiment. A series of \r\nelections were held, with the support of international \r\npartners, leading to the ratification by popular \r\nreferendum of the Constitution in June 2006. \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 42 \r\n \r\n A Parliament with two chambers was elected in \r\nNovember of the same year; a new president of the \r\nRepublic was elected in March 2007; and a new law \r\nfor the organization of the press was enacted in \r\nOctober 2006, establishing a higher authority for the \r\npress, radio and television. With respect to good \r\ngovernance, a new general inspectorate of the State \r\nwas established; transparency initiative was \r\nimplemented in the field of extracting industries; \r\npublic officials were compelled to disclose their \r\nfinancial affairs and property; and public transactions \r\nare now undertaken in a transparent manner. Lastly, \r\nwomen were accorded a quota of 20 per cent of all \r\ncandidatures in our Islamic republic. As a result, \r\n18 women were elected to the current Parliament. \r\n Those splendid achievements, in addition to the \r\natmosphere of harmony and accord enjoyed by the \r\npeople of Mauritania, are the result of the work of the \r\nmilitary establishment, which pledged to complete the \r\nprocess within the announced time frame and indeed \r\nkept its promise. Once the former President assumed \r\noffice, anything was possible in the new Mauritania, \r\nwith all its new institutional gains, in terms of \r\nconsolidating and deepening the achievements of the \r\ntransitional period of 2005 to 2007. Regrettably, from \r\nthe outset the former President demonstrated his \r\nweakness and inability to lead the country and confront \r\nthe many challenges it faced. \r\n Conditions in the country continued to seriously \r\ndeteriorate over the following 15 months in the \r\npolitical, security, economic and social fields. The \r\ndeteriorating situation posed a real threat to the \r\ncountry’s peace, security and stability. Indeed, it \r\nthreatened the very existence and foundations of the \r\nState. \r\n Thus our country has, over the past three months, \r\nundergone an institutional crisis that led to an \r\ninterruption in the work of parliamentary institutions \r\nand paralysed the affairs of the State, the stability of \r\nwhich was threatened by the intransigence of the \r\nexecutive authority, which prevented Parliament from \r\nexercising its constitutional powers. \r\n In order to secure the loyalty of some \r\nparliamentarians from the majority party who were \r\nunhappy with the difficult situation and concerned \r\nabout the future of the country, the former President \r\nresorted to certain illegal measures that would be \r\nunacceptable in any democratic system. He used public \r\nfunds to buy the allegiance of some parliamentarians. \r\nIn addition, he made some irregular appointments and \r\narbitrarily fired some high-ranking public officials in \r\norder to stem the people’s desire for change. Moreover, \r\nhe continuously threatened to dissolve Parliament in \r\norder to prevent the formation of a parliamentary \r\ncommittee to investigate the sources of financing of a \r\nprivate business created by his family. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n In the field of security and as a result of his laxity \r\nand refusal to heed the advice of the security services, \r\na number of terrorist acts took place for the first time \r\nin the country’s history, following the release of a \r\nnumber of terrorists who had been in custody until he \r\ntook office. \r\n Economically and socially, the situation was \r\nsimply disastrous. While the people suffered in \r\npoverty, hunger and disease, the former President — \r\nwho, in the aftermath of floods that hit the country, had \r\nvisited only one city inside Mauritania, the city of \r\nTintane — made 25 visits abroad, costing Mauritanian \r\ntaxpayers huge amounts of money, without achieving \r\nany tangible results in the field of cooperation between \r\nMauritania and its development partners. \r\n The former President continuously and \r\nintentionally obstructed the work of democratic \r\ninstitutions and thus paralysed the State. Faced with the \r\nfailure of his manoeuvres, he resorted to firing high-\r\nranking officials in the leadership of the army and the \r\nsecurity services at the same time. That almost led to a \r\nconfrontation between high-ranking officers and \r\ncreated a situation that could have brought the country \r\nto the brink of civil war. \r\n In view of the political impasse, the armed forces \r\nand security forces, conscious of the serious dangers to \r\nthe country, intervened to correct the abuses and to \r\nstrengthen national unity and other gains made in the \r\ncountry, as well as its prospects for development and \r\nprogress. That change enjoys the support of two thirds \r\nof the members of Parliament, approximately 90 per cent of \r\nmayors and two thirds of recognized political parties, in \r\naddition to civil society organizations, including \r\ncultural and professional societies. Support has also \r\nbeen come from unprecedented popular marches. \r\n The High Council of State declared its \r\ncommitment to protecting democracy and enhancing \r\ndemocratic processes in Mauritania; guaranteeing the \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n43 08-53141 \r\n \r\ncontinued regular functioning of State institutions; \r\nallowing officially recognized political parties to carry \r\nout their activities; guaranteeing freedom of the press \r\nand the media; respecting the obligations, agreements \r\nand international treaties concluded in the name of the \r\nMauritanian State; and organizing free and transparent \r\nelections at the earliest possible date. \r\n Aware of the importance of and need for \r\nintegration among countries and peoples of the world, \r\nMauritania reaffirms its adherence to the Arab \r\nMaghreb Union as a strategic choice of the people of \r\nthe region, the League of Arab States, the African \r\nUnion and the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations. \r\n In the same spirit, we reiterate our support for \r\nefforts to reform the United Nations and, in particular, \r\nthe Security Council. We believe that the African \r\ncontinent should be given permanent representation on \r\nthe Security Council; Africa has been the only \r\ncontinent without permanent representation in the \r\nCouncil since the creation of this Organization. We \r\nalso call for giving the Arab Group representation in \r\nthe Security Council in view of the fact that it \r\nrepresents more than 11 per cent of the peoples of the \r\nworld. We support granting permanent seats in the \r\nSecurity Council to Japan and Germany, since both \r\ncountries play a vital role in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Allow me to pay special tribute to the great \r\nefforts made at the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly in the field of development, especially with \r\nrespect to the steep rise in food prices and all other \r\ngoods, the financing of development projects and the \r\nproblem of greenhouse gases and their effect on the \r\nplanet. \r\n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \r\nfalls at a very difficult time, when the world is \r\nconfronting sharp increases in food prices, that \r\nnegatively affect the economies of developing \r\ncountries and could even undermine the economic \r\nstructure of those countries if no urgent measures are \r\ntaken to address the problem. The food crisis facing the \r\nworld requires concerted international efforts and \r\nstrategies to overcome its negative effects. \r\n Today, we are halfway to the deadline for \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nHowever, many developing countries are still far from \r\nachieving those Goals. That is why we call on rich \r\ncountries to keep their promises to finance \r\ndevelopment in the developing world. \r\n The Arab-Israeli conflict is a source of tension \r\nand a threat to international peace and security in a \r\nvital and sensitive region of the world. That is why my \r\ncountry supports the efforts to settle the conflict in a \r\nmanner that guarantees the Palestinian people the \r\nrestoration of their rights and the establishment of their \r\nown State, with Jerusalem as its capital, coexisting in \r\npeace and security with the State of Israel. \r\n As regards the question of the Sudan, we totally \r\nand categorically reject the most recent developments, \r\nin particular the request of the Prosecutor of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant \r\nfor the President of the Sudan. We believe that such a \r\nmove would jeopardize peace efforts in that brotherly \r\ncountry and increase tensions in that sensitive region of \r\nthe world. \r\n My country follows the question of the Western \r\nSahara with interest. While we welcome the latest steps \r\ntaken to return to the negotiating table, we also renew \r\nour support for the efforts of the Secretary-General to \r\nreach a final settlement acceptable to both parties. \r\n The dissemination of the culture of peace and the \r\nspirit and values of tolerance among peoples and \r\ncivilizations, the restoration of rights and the \r\nrealization of justice among peoples are, in our view, \r\nthe best way to maintain peace and security in the \r\nworld. The fact that certain questions that have gone \r\nunresolved for so long, the widening gap between the \r\npoor and the rich, the unfair structure of the global \r\neconomy and the absence of any attempt to spread \r\njustice, equality and fairness have all contributed to the \r\ncreation of conflicts and to the phenomena of \r\nextremism and terrorism. \r\n We in Mauritania condemn and reject terrorism in \r\nall its forms. We are equally committed to adhering to \r\nour tolerant Islamic values, which reject violence and \r\nextremism and call for tolerance and brotherhood. We \r\nbelieve that the international family should seriously \r\nconsider the causes of the phenomenon of terrorism \r\nand ways to confront and eradicate it fully from the \r\nworld. \r\n We affirm the importance accorded by developing \r\ncountries to development as we look forward with hope \r\nto the results of the Doha Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development scheduled \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 44 \r\n \r\nfrom 29 November to 2 December 2008. We also \r\nwould like to express our concern at the deadlock of \r\nthe Doha Round of trade negotiations and call on \r\nindustrialized countries to show more flexibility and \r\nstronger political will in that respect. \r\n Development has economic, social and \r\nenvironmental dimensions. Any shortcomings in any \r\none of those dimensions negatively affects the others. \r\nThat is why we highlight the need to address the \r\nphenomenon of climate change. My country is one of \r\nthe 10 countries that would be the most vulnerable to \r\nthe effects of greenhouse gas emissions if they should \r\ncause a rise in sea levels. We call on industrial \r\ncountries to limit the emissions that lead to greenhouse \r\neffects. \r\n The commitments undertaken by the international \r\ncommunity at the time of the establishment of this \r\nOrganization will not be implemented unless all \r\ncountries and peoples of the world are able to benefit \r\nfrom global resources and unless development efforts \r\nin the developing countries are supported with a view \r\nto creating conditions conducive to decent living in \r\nfreedom and equality. Only then will we have honoured \r\nthe commitments we have always affirmed. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I call next on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Atoki Ileka, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo) \r\n(spoke in French): I wish at the outset to discharge the \r\npleasant duty of conveying to you, Sir, the message of \r\nHis Excellency, Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who is \r\nunable to attend and therefore asked me to convey to \r\nyou his sincerest congratulations on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nthird session. He has no doubt that your great \r\nexperience, enriched by your skills and knowledge, \r\nwill allow you to fulfil the heavy responsibility that has \r\nbeen entrusted to you, to the satisfaction of all. \r\n I should also like to pay tribute to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, and congratulate him \r\non the dedication and skill with which he fulfilled his \r\nmandate. Finally, I should like to pay due homage to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose reforming \r\nefforts, commitment and energy have enhanced the role \r\nof the United Nations and made it more credible to \r\nMember States and to international public opinion. \r\n This session is opening at a particularly difficult \r\nmoment for humanity. The international financial \r\ncrisis, the sharp rises in the cost of food, energy and \r\nfuel, and the effects of climate change are weakening \r\neconomies throughout the world, particularly those of \r\nthe developing countries. They are a threat to \r\ninternational peace and stability and therefore represent \r\na major challenge to which the community of nations \r\nmust respond in a concerted, decisive and tangible way. \r\n With regard in particular to the global food crisis \r\nand the sharp rise in food prices, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Congo calls for new, innovative and urgent \r\naction to be taken beyond the recommendations made \r\nat the Rome Summit. We also endorse the appeal for \r\nthe mobilization of the resources necessary for the \r\nWorld Food Programme to implement its strategic plan \r\nand achieve its priority mission. We are firmly \r\nconvinced that human intelligence, which makes all \r\nscientific progress possible, should also allow us to \r\neliminate hunger throughout the world, provided that \r\nwe do so at the global level and that all States \r\ndemonstrate the necessary political will. It is on the \r\nbasis of that belief that the member countries of the \r\nEconomic Community of Central African States held a \r\nregional meeting in Kinshasa in July in order to rise to \r\nthe challenge posed to our subregion by the food crisis \r\nand the sharp rise in food costs. We made a frank \r\ndiagnosis, and concrete and urgent measures were \r\ntaken. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is \r\ndetermined to make an active contribution towards \r\nimplementing those measures.  \r\n Similarly, the United Nations environmental \r\nconventions that the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nratified include the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification, the United \r\nNations Convention on Biological Diversity and the \r\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the \r\nOzone Layer. \r\n Home to 60 per cent of the forests of the Congo \r\nbasin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is aware \r\nof the crucial role that it can play in controlling the \r\nglobal climate. It intends to assume that role in a fully \r\nresponsible way, provided that the international \r\ncommunity provides in exchange fair remuneration for \r\nthe environmental goods and services that are provided \r\nby the forests of Congo to all humankind. \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n45 08-53141 \r\n \r\n The fact that the different crises are affecting — \r\nthough perhaps in different ways — all countries \r\nthroughout the world without exception clearly \r\ndemonstrates the futility of any claim to protective \r\nisolation. On the other hand, it demonstrates the \r\ncommon destiny of all humans and the justification for \r\nthe dialogue of religions, cultures and civilizations, \r\neach of which must be protected and respected as an \r\nintegral and irreplaceable part of the human heritage. \r\nWe therefore commend the maturity of those States that \r\nhave apologized or expressed regrets, and even offered \r\ncompensation for the harm caused to others by slavery, \r\ncolonization, aggressive behaviour or violations of \r\nfundamental human rights and the rights of peoples. \r\nThat will leave in the collective universal memory an \r\nindelible testimony to those who, in the name of a \r\ntransitory supremacy that scorned the true basic nature \r\nof the world, claimed eternal superiority and at one \r\npoint in history claimed to have a lasting moral right \r\nover weaker people. \r\n With the promise of a great future but weakened \r\nby years of bad government and war, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, thanks to the confidence of its \r\npeople and the sustained support of the international \r\ncommunity, has risen again as a State, a republic and a \r\ndemocracy. Indeed, following the success of our \r\nreunification and pacification efforts, and after \r\nexemplary presidential, legislative and provincial \r\nelections, the legitimate new authorities of our country \r\nlaunched a programme of reconstruction and are now \r\nready to organize urban, municipal and local elections \r\nin order to allow the people to choose their own local \r\nrepresentatives responsible for everyday affairs. \r\n The improvement, however, needs to be shored \r\nup urgently, because two territories in North Kivu, out \r\nof the 142 that make up the Republic, are still the scene \r\nof a dangerous security situation that could undermine \r\nall the investments that have been made towards the \r\nrebirth of the country. In fact, because of one of the \r\nnational armed groups, the Congrès national pour la \r\ndéfense du peuple (CNDP), it has not yet been possible \r\nto enjoy the full benefits of the AMANI Forum — \r\n“Amani” means peace in Swahili — to implement the \r\nact of engagement signed at the Conference on Peace, \r\nSecurity and Development for the provinces of North \r\nand South Kivu, held in Goma from 6 to 25 January \r\n2008 at the initiative of the Head of State. On the \r\ncontrary, fighting has broken out again, which has \r\ncreated a massive displacement of populations and led \r\nto renewed violations of human rights. \r\n With regard to the Nairobi communiqué, which \r\nwas the basis for resolving the problem of the harmful \r\npresence in the same region of the country of armed \r\nelements from the Forces démocratiques de libération \r\ndu Rwanda (FDLR). That group continues to sow death \r\nand destruction despite the progress that has been made \r\nelsewhere. That progress includes, first, the \r\norganization of information and awareness-raising \r\nprogrammes for armed Rwandan groups in order to \r\nensure their voluntary participation in disarmament \r\nfollowed by their return to Rwanda, their country of \r\norigin, if they so wish, or to relocate them far from the \r\nborder between the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand Rwanda, or outside Congolese territory; secondly, \r\nthe cantonment, disarmament and voluntary \r\nrepatriation to Rwanda of several dozen FDLR \r\nelements and their dependants; and, finally, the \r\ndeployment of special brigades of the Forces armíes de \r\nla Republique démocratique du Congo, who will work \r\nwith the United Nations Organization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to \r\ncompel, if necessary, reluctant FDLR elements to \r\naccept the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration \r\nand resettlement or repatriation programme and to \r\ncurtail their movements. \r\n In the face of a resurgence in violence, the Head \r\nof State has taken the initiative once again by \r\nreasserting the Government’s support for the Goma act \r\nof engagement and the AMANI Forum as the best way \r\nto put an end to the presence of armed groups in North \r\nand South Kivu and for the Nairobi communiqué to \r\nresolve the problem of the FDLR. Under his initiatives, \r\na disengagement plan drawn up by MONUC has been \r\nadopted and a verification and monitoring mechanism \r\nis being developed. Accepted by the Government and \r\nthe armed groups, with the exception of the CNDP, the \r\nplan will come into force on 1 October and end 45 days \r\nlater. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo calls \r\nupon the Security Council to support the plan and \r\nprovide MONUC with a clear mandate and adequate \r\nresources in order, if necessary, to impose peace and \r\nsecurity in that part of the Congolese territory. The \r\ncredibility of the United Nations and its peacekeeping \r\nmissions — of which that in the Congo is by far the \r\nlargest — are at stake. \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 46 \r\n \r\n The human conscience cannot tolerate and the \r\npeople of Congo cannot understand how, despite \r\nhaving leaders legitimately elected by the people and \r\nwho enjoy international recognition, a small group \r\nshould be allowed to maintain a perpetual rebellion, \r\nentailing the rape of women and the loss of human life \r\non a massive scale. In the face of the tragedy in the \r\neastern Congo, MONUC should be authorized to act \r\nand be able to act convincingly. It is our firm belief \r\nthat there could be no more legitimate use of force or \r\ntimely exercise of the United Nations moral authority. \r\n In addition to the efforts made to eliminate \r\ninsecurity in the East of our country, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo is seeking to strengthen the rule \r\nof law, consolidate democracy and ensure good \r\ngovernance. Justice is therefore one of the pillars of \r\nour policy. For approximately 10 years now, our \r\ncountry has witnessed millions of deaths, the direct or \r\nindirect victims of armed conflicts. Entire families \r\nhave been wiped out, mass graves abound, and \r\nviolence against women has reached unprecedented \r\nlevels. The country is trying to remedy the situation. \r\nFor that reason, we supported Security Council \r\nresolution 1820 (2008) on women and peace and \r\nsecurity, and we thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhaving placed the suffering of the women and girls of \r\nthe Congo high on his agenda and for the support he \r\nhas given us in that regard. \r\n What we need most of all, however, and what the \r\npeople of the Congo ardently desire and which we are \r\nduty-bound to guarantee to them is the right to justice. \r\nThat means neither more nor less than putting an end \r\nto impunity. How can we prevent recidivism and \r\ncopycat offences if, thanks to political horse-trading, \r\ncriminals are not prosecuted? How can we put an end \r\nto the rape of women and girls and other massive \r\nviolations of human rights if the warlords are exempt \r\nfrom legal prosecution because of their military \r\nstrength or capacity for doing great harm? The logic of \r\ncivilized society is specifically intended to counter the \r\nlaw of force with the force of the law. \r\n In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we \r\nhave experienced the unique role that justice plays as a \r\nfactor for national harmony and reconciliation, peace, \r\nsecurity and stability. It is thanks to justice that we \r\nhave been able to bring lasting peace to Ituri and North \r\nKatanga. It is with the support of justice that we intend \r\nto restore peace throughout our country. It will be \r\nnational justice preferably, international justice if \r\nnecessary, but justice in any case is a fundamental \r\nrequirement. It is in that context that we must place \r\nefforts to rehabilitate the national judicial system, and \r\nit is in the same framework that we are cooperating \r\nwith the International Criminal Court. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also \r\ndoing its very best to meet the fundamental needs of its \r\npeople in the areas of healthcare, education, self-\r\nsufficiency in food, basic infrastructure, electricity, \r\ndrinking water for all and, of course, efforts to \r\ncounteract HIV/AIDS, malaria and, above all poverty. \r\nFive pillars have been established to that end. They \r\ninvolve infrastructure, employment, housing, education \r\nand health, and water and electricity. The complexity \r\nof those areas in a country as large as ours justifies the \r\nscope of the contributions we seek. The Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo is therefore open to any partner \r\nthat can help us meet the challenges of reconstruction \r\nand development. \r\n All peoples of the world aspire to peace; hence \r\nthe need for international and regional mechanisms and \r\ninstruments for peacekeeping and conflict prevention \r\nand settlement. Therefore, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo welcomes the fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has accepted our request to establish a United \r\nNations Peacebuilding Office for Central Africa. We \r\nare convinced that the Office will promote greater \r\ncloseness and coordination between the United Nations \r\nand the countries of the region. The issues of peace, \r\nsecurity, humanitarian aid and development will be \r\nconsidered expeditiously and treated with the urgency \r\nthat they merit. \r\n In more global terms, we continue to support the \r\nefforts of the Organization in its various efforts to \r\npromote peace, security, human rights, gender equality \r\nand development. In that context, we call for \r\naccelerated reform of the United Nations and the \r\nSecurity Council, because achieving our dreams in the \r\nface of current and future challenges depends on it. The \r\nUnited Nations must change and adapt itself to meeting \r\nthe new challenges of armed conflict, globalization, the \r\nlack of financial resources adequate to the breadth of \r\nits missions, pandemics, terrorism, and the need to \r\nbuttress the system of collective security, particularly \r\nby enlarging the number of decision-makers in terms of \r\ninternational peace and security and by ensuring a \r\nmore balanced and fair representation of the world in \r\nthe Security Council. That is an indispensable \r\ndemocratic requirement for the proper and effective \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n47 08-53141 \r\n \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations system. In that \r\nregard, the African continent should be represented as a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council. \r\n Furthermore, the need for Security Council \r\nreform should not obscure the need to review other \r\nbodies of the United Nations system, particularly the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Secretariat. The \r\nsame applies to the working methods of the other \r\ncouncils and the International Court of Justice, which \r\nneed to be revised, while their interaction with bodies \r\nyet to be created must be better identified and \r\ndelineated. Similarly, efforts to revitalize the work of \r\nthe General Assembly should continue and its authority \r\nstrengthened in order to allow its President to play a \r\nkey role in finding solutions to international problems. \r\n It is said that nature only poses threats to \r\nhumankind that its creativity is capable of addressing. \r\nDespite our differences, the time has come to put our \r\nindividual imaginations together to ensure that the keys \r\nof the global economy are not left to out-and-out \r\ncapitalism. We should instead use the universal values \r\nof justice, solidarity and altruism to promote peace and \r\ninternational security. We believe that, together, we can \r\nprovide a better future for humanity so long as we \r\nwork every day to achieve the ideals of our universal \r\norganization. \r\n I wish every success to this sixty-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Anders Lidén, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Sweden. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): The United Nations was \r\nbuilt on common values and norms. The United \r\nNations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights and other key documents not only express those \r\nvalues and norms, but also constitute international law, \r\nthe foundation upon which every attempt to build a \r\nlasting peace must rest. Rules of international law \r\napply equally to all States, large and small. According \r\nto the United Nations Charter, “Members shall settle \r\ntheir international disputes by peaceful means” and \r\n“refrain … from the threat or use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any \r\nState”. We look to the United Nations, and in particular \r\nto the Security Council, to uphold those rules. The five \r\npermanent members have a special responsibility in \r\nthat regard. \r\n Russia’s invasion of Georgia — a sovereign State \r\nand a Member of the United Nations — using massive \r\nmilitary force, is a clear violation of the United \r\nNations Charter. Russia’s subsequent recognition of \r\nparts of Georgia as independent States stands in stark \r\ncontradiction to international law, including principles \r\nand commitments agreed in the context of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \r\nincluding the Helsinki Final Act. Sweden unreservedly \r\nsupports the territorial integrity of Georgia. We call on \r\nRussia to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the \r\nsix-point plan brokered by the European Union and to \r\nwithdraw all forces to their positions before 7 August. \r\n This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. While celebrating the achievements, we \r\nrecognize the challenges that remain. The Declaration’s \r\nhistoric article 21 on democracy, which reads in part: \r\n“Everyone has the right to take part in the government \r\nof his country, directly or through freely chosen \r\nrepresentatives”, is a perfect illustration of that point. \r\nSince 1948, millions of people have gained the \r\nfreedom of democratic choice, while millions of others \r\nare still denied that freedom. \r\n Sweden places a strong emphasis on democracy \r\nand human rights in our development cooperation. Our \r\nefforts to make the Universal Declaration and other \r\nhuman rights norms a reality everywhere must also \r\ninclude the United Nations itself. Human rights should \r\nbe an essential part of all United Nations activities, \r\nincluding conflict prevention, peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding efforts, as well as in the work of the \r\nfunds and programmes. \r\n To fight terrorism is to defend human rights. \r\nHuman rights are the key also to countering terrorism. \r\nMeasures against terrorism will be effective and \r\nlegitimate only when they are taken within a clear \r\nframework of international law. It is essential that the \r\nSecurity Council have fair and clear procedures in \r\nmatters of listing and delisting when targeted sanctions \r\nhave been imposed. The fight against impunity has to \r\ncontinue. We must support the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Bringing to justice those responsible for the \r\nmost serious crimes is vital to building sustainable \r\npeace. At the same time, justice should be pursued in a \r\nmanner that supports peace processes. \r\n States have a responsibility to protect people \r\nwithin their own borders from massive violations of \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 48 \r\n \r\ntheir human rights. If a State is not capable of doing so, \r\nit should ask the international community — the \r\nUnited Nations or regional organizations — for help. \r\nWe must all be ready to assist. Not long ago, the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union were able to \r\nhelp Kenya to prevent a frightening crisis from turning \r\ninto the worst possible nightmare. If a State is \r\nunwilling to protect people within its borders, the \r\nSecurity Council must assume its responsibility to \r\nprotect. We need a Security Council that is ready to \r\nshoulder that responsibility and to work together, \r\nbecause unilateral action might run the risk of \r\naggravating the problem and undermining international \r\nlaw and legitimacy. \r\n Violence against women and girls is a major \r\nobstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms by all people. Efforts to combat \r\nsuch violence must not end with a peace agreement. \r\nWe must ensure that women have full access to justice, \r\nalso in the transition from war to peace. Last June, the \r\nlandmark Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on \r\nwomen and peace and security was followed up by \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1820 (2008) on sexual \r\nviolence. It reaffirms that rape and other forms of \r\nsexual violence can be war crimes or crimes against \r\nhumanity. It obliges Governments to combat such \r\nbehaviour by all necessary means. Although the United \r\nNations has made considerable efforts in that area, \r\nmore needs to be done, both in the field and at \r\nHeadquarters. \r\n The European Union and the Council of Europe \r\nhave established 10 October as the European Day \r\nagainst the Death Penalty. I hope that before too long \r\nwe shall be able to agree on a United Nations day \r\nagainst that inhumane form of punishment. \r\n We face a growing danger of nuclear \r\nproliferation. Iran, though not the only case, is the \r\nmost worrisome at present. Recent developments in the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea also give cause \r\nfor concern. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of \r\nnon-proliferation and the foundation for the pursuit of \r\nnuclear disarmament. Sweden is strongly committed to \r\nupholding and further strengthening existing \r\nmultilateral disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nobligations. The nuclear Powers have taken on special \r\ncommitments within the NPT process. In order not to \r\nundermine the Treaty, they must demonstrate their \r\nreadiness to substantially reduce their nuclear arsenals. \r\n More efforts are needed, in particular in Africa, to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nby 2015. Therefore, Sweden is increasing its support to \r\nAfrica. We encourage others to do the same, as well as \r\nto deliver on the aid commitments already made. In the \r\nlong run, the rise in the price of energy and food could \r\nhave a positive effect on development in the \r\nagricultural sector. In the short run, however, it could \r\njeopardize the fulfilment of the MDGs and threaten \r\nprogress already made. Communicable diseases, not \r\nleast HIV/AIDS, are another obstacle to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs that we must address. The \r\nAccra meeting on the Paris Declaration took important \r\nsteps towards better aid effectiveness and reconfirmed \r\nthe shared responsibility for development. However, \r\nmuch more must be done in areas such as democratic \r\ngovernance and human rights, the role of women in \r\ndevelopment, and the impact of global climate change. \r\n That is a challenge for developing and developed \r\ncountries alike. The world economy is facing \r\nturbulence and uncertainty. A more open trade regime \r\nwould bring increased economic growth and \r\ninterdependence, which in turn would have a \r\nsignificant stabilizing effect. Trade policy is one of the \r\ntools to help developing countries become integrated \r\ninto the world economy and reap the benefits of trade. \r\nTrade reforms are fundamental for sustainable \r\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. We regret the \r\nfailure to reach a breakthrough in the World Trade \r\nOrganization Doha Round. We all share a \r\nresponsibility to resolve the few remaining issues. \r\n The United Nations system — both in the field \r\nand at Headquarters — must be reformed in order to \r\nensure coherence and effectiveness. Reforms must also \r\nenable the United Nations to work more effectively on \r\ngender issues and for the promotion of equal rights and \r\nopportunities. \r\n The United Nations needs to bolster its capacity \r\nto handle the unprecedented demand for peace \r\noperations. Cooperation with regional organizations \r\nand arrangements, such as the European Union, NATO \r\nand the African Union, is essential. \r\n Sweden strongly supports efforts to bridge crisis \r\nmanagement and long-term development in post-\r\nconflict situations. By chairing the Burundi \r\nconfiguration of the Peacebuilding Commission, we \r\nhope to be able to contribute to further developing the \r\nrole of the United Nations in peacebuilding. \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n49 08-53141 \r\n \r\n Sweden was proud to host the first annual review \r\nmeeting of the International Compact with Iraq. The \r\npartnership between the Government of Iraq and the \r\nUnited Nations is crucial. It is therefore imperative to \r\ncontinue strengthening the role of the United Nations \r\nin Iraq. \r\n It is the poorest who are the hardest hit by climate \r\nchange. Therefore, Sweden is providing additional \r\nresources for a special climate initiative in our \r\ndevelopment cooperation. It aims to contribute \r\neffectively to long-term efforts to combat climate \r\nchange and its effects in developing countries. \r\n Climate change is a crucial challenge facing our \r\nplanet. We recognize our responsibility to take concrete \r\nsteps at home and to show the leadership necessary to \r\nachieve broad and long-term international consensus. \r\nOne year from now, Sweden will hold the presidency \r\nof the European Union. In that capacity, Sweden will \r\ntake on a special responsibility regarding efforts to put \r\nan international climate agreement in place by 2009 in \r\nCopenhagen. The key to a successful conclusion of \r\nthose negotiations, however, rests with each and every \r\none of us. \r\n It is time to once again remind ourselves of our \r\nmutual commitments and to stand up for the universal \r\nprinciples underpinning international cooperation. It is \r\ntime to muster the political will to reassert our shared \r\nvalues. It is time to show that we are determined to \r\nwork jointly to foster peace, democracy and \r\ndevelopment worldwide. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Archbishop Celestino Migliore, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the Observer State of the \r\nHoly See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): As the last \r\nspeaker on your list, Mr. President, I think I can \r\ncongratulate you on this important debate, and quote \r\nthe Latin saying, dulce est in fundo, which you know \r\nvery well — sweetness comes at the end. \r\n As you assume the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session, my delegation \r\nwishes you all the best in your endeavours and looks \r\nforward to working with you in order to address the \r\nmany challenges facing the global community. \r\n This general debate is an occasion for those \r\nresponsible for the national life of every country to \r\ncome together to take the pulse of the world situation. \r\nBy its nature and structure, the United Nations \r\nnormally creates neither events nor trends, but rather \r\nserves as a sounding board where events and trends are \r\nsubmitted for debate and a coherent, consensual and \r\ntimely response. \r\n This year has been dominated by a number of \r\nchallenges and crises: natural and man-made \r\ncalamities, staggering economies, financial turmoil, \r\nrising food and fuel prices, the impact of climate \r\nchange, local wars and tensions. We have been called \r\nto this Hall once again to identify the common causes \r\nand denominators underlying those diverse crises and \r\nto craft adequate long-term solutions. \r\n One of the clear facts, recognized by all, is that \r\nevery crisis presents a mixture of natural factors and \r\nelements of human responsibility. However, they are \r\nall too often compounded by the tardy responses, \r\nfailures or reluctance of leaders to exercise their \r\nresponsibility to protect their populations. \r\n When speaking within these walls of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, the common understanding of \r\nthe term is found in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\nDocument, which refers to the responsibility of the \r\ninternational community to intervene in situations \r\nwhere individual Governments are not able or willing \r\nto assure the protection of their own citizens. \r\n In the past, the language of protection was too \r\noften a pretext for expansion and aggression. In spite \r\nof the many advances in international law, that same \r\nunderstanding and practice tragically continues today. \r\nHowever, during the past year, in this same Hall there \r\nhas been growing consensus and greater inclusion of \r\nthis expression as a vital component of responsible \r\nleadership. The responsibility to protect has been \r\ninvoked by some as an essential aspect of the exercise \r\nof sovereignty at the national and international levels, \r\nwhile others have relaunched the concept of the \r\nexercise of responsible sovereignty. \r\n For his part, Pope Benedict XVI, in his address to \r\nthe General Assembly last April, also recognized that, \r\nfrom the very ancient philosophical discourses on \r\ngovernance to the more modern development of the \r\nnation State, the responsibility to protect has served \r\nand must continue to serve as the principle shared by \r\nall nations in governing their populations and \r\nregulating relations between peoples. Those statements \r\nreassert the historical and moral basis for States to \r\ngovern. Likewise, they reassert that good governance \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 50 \r\n \r\nshould no longer be measured simply within the \r\ncontext of a State’s rights or sovereignty, but rather by \r\nits ability to care for those who entrust it with the grave \r\nmoral responsibility to lead. \r\n We the peoples who formed the United Nations \r\nconceived the responsibility to protect as the core basis \r\nfor the United Nations. The founding leaders believed \r\nthat the responsibility to protect would consist not \r\nprimarily of the use of force in order to restore peace \r\nand human rights, but rather in States coming together \r\nto detect and denounce early symptoms of every kind \r\nof crisis, mobilizing Governments, civil society and \r\npublic opinion to find the causes and to offer solutions. \r\nThe various agencies and bodies of the United Nations \r\nalso reaffirm the importance of the responsibility to \r\nprotect in their ability to work in close proximity and \r\nsolidarity with affected populations and to put \r\ndetection, implementation and monitoring mechanisms \r\ninto place. It is incumbent not only upon States, but \r\nalso upon the United Nations to ensure that the \r\nresponsibility to protect serves as the underlying \r\nmeasure and motivation of all its work. \r\n While many continue to question and debate the \r\nreal causes and medium- and long-term consequences \r\nof the various financial, humanitarian and food crises \r\naround the world, the United Nations and its \r\nmembership have the responsibility to provide \r\ndirection, coherence and resolution. It is not only the \r\ncredibility of the Organization and our global leaders \r\nthat is at stake, but rather and more importantly the \r\nability of the human community to provide food and \r\nsecurity and to protect basic human rights so that all \r\npeoples have the opportunity to live with freedom from \r\nfear and want, thus realizing their inherent dignity. \r\n One area in which our best intentions require \r\nurgent action is climate change. My delegation \r\ncommends Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nleadership in recognizing the urgency of tackling that \r\nissue, and we commend States and civil society for \r\nmaking the necessary political and personal sacrifices \r\nto ensure a better future. \r\n The challenge of climate change and the various \r\nsolutions proposed and put into action have led us to \r\ncall attention to a preoccupation and inconsistency \r\nexisting today in the realm of international and national \r\nlaw — that all that is technically possible must be \r\nlegally licit. \r\n In adopting ever more stringent norms to protect \r\nthe environment and nature, it is often rightly affirmed \r\nthat not all environmental activity should be allowed \r\nand sanctioned by law just because it is technically \r\npossible and economically profitable. Indiscriminate \r\ndeforestation, the dumping of radioactive waste and \r\ninvasive and devastating acts on nature are often more \r\nexpedient and technically possible, but because they \r\nprovoke our conscience, as well as our responsibility \r\ntowards creation, we decide to invoke the principle that \r\neven though it is possible it should not be legally licit. \r\n However, when passing from the ecological field \r\nto that of humans, we have a tendency to affirm the \r\nopposite principle — that all which is technically \r\npossible should be legally licit and consequently \r\npursued. Whether regarding the production of arms for \r\nwar, biotechnological engineering, the taking of human \r\nlife, reproductive technology or the structure of the \r\nfamily itself, we have the tendency to advocate that all \r\nwhich is technologically possible should also be legally \r\nlicit. That inconsistency calls into question whether we \r\ntruly place humans at the centre of decision-making. \r\n The global community must come together to \r\nreverse that contradiction and engage in a political \r\ndiscourse that recognizes the centrality of humans in \r\nall aspects of political and technological development. \r\nThe same principles that lead us to oppose unchecked \r\ntechnology and policies that destroy the environment \r\nshould also guide us in our prudent use of technologies \r\nand the creation of policies that directly impact the \r\nlives of individuals. Short of that, we will succumb to \r\nan inconsistency that penalizes the individual and \r\nhuman society and risks paving the way towards the \r\nimposition of laws by the more powerful and the \r\ncreation of a new mass of losers. \r\n As we embark on this session of the General \r\nAssembly, we strive to fashion an Organization that \r\nreflects our highest and best intentions and carefully \r\nplaces the needs of all people, regardless of their \r\neconomic and political standing, at the centre of our \r\ndecisions and responsibility. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the general debate. \r\n Before giving the floor to those representatives \r\nwho have asked to speak in exercise of the right of \r\nreply, I remind members that statements in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply should be limited to 10 minutes for \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n51 08-53141 \r\n \r\nthe first statement and five minutes for the second, and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): My delegation attentively \r\nlistened to the blatant and meaningless accusation \r\nmade by the Foreign Minister of Eritrea against my \r\ncountry. In exercise of our right of reply, I wish to state \r\nthe following to set the record straight. \r\n Ethiopia rejects the imaginary Eritrean claim that \r\nEthiopia occupies Eritrean sovereign territory. On the \r\ncontrary, it was in fact the belligerent regime in \r\nAsmara that declared an unwarranted war of aggression \r\nagainst Yemen, against the Sudan, against Ethiopia and \r\nnow against Djibouti. Eritrea is now illegally \r\noccupying Djibouti’s territory. \r\n We believe that the continued silence of the \r\ninternational community, including the United Nations \r\nmost particularly, in not categorically deploring such \r\nbehaviour has only resulted in further emboldening the \r\nregime in Asmara. They must be told that enough is \r\nenough with their rogue politics. \r\n The cause of all this is the total absence of \r\ninstitutions in Asmara. In Eritrea today, there is only a \r\none-man show and accountability is unheard of. The \r\none man is the President; he is the Government; he is \r\nthe State; and he is the country itself. Eritrea is the \r\nonly country in Africa today which is not ruled, let \r\nalone by a constitution, but even by a mere presidential \r\ndecree. It is a country ruled by an absolute dictatorship \r\nin whose solitary regime and solitary empire, the term \r\nelection — let alone the institution of elections — is a \r\nculpable derogation. It is a country thrown into the \r\nabyss of absolute and unfortunate isolation by the very \r\nacts and conducts of its ruthless dictatorial regime. \r\n To set the record straight, Ethiopia is in Somalia \r\nnot as an invading force, but at the invitation of the \r\nTransitional Federal Institutions in Somalia — the \r\nGovernment and the Parliament of the Transitional \r\nFederal Government of Somalia. Ethiopia is therefore a \r\nforce of stabilization and not, like Eritrea, \r\ndestabilization. \r\n It is Eritrea, rather, that is hosting regional and \r\ninternational terrorists whose names are still to be \r\nfound on the consolidated list of terrorists documented \r\nby the Security Council. Eritrea is directly supporting \r\nand collaborating with the terrorists and spoilers of \r\nSomalia. I wish therefore to stress that Ethiopia once \r\nagain urges the international community to call a spade \r\na spade and note that the conduct of the regime in \r\nAsmara is unacceptable to the civilized world. \r\n It is clear that Eritrea has made a strategic \r\ndecision. It is not prepared to discuss any \r\nnormalization of relations or indeed to coexist with \r\nEthiopia and the countries of the region. We are the \r\ntarget of continued destabilization activities offered \r\nand perpetuated by the rogue regime in Eritrea. Let it \r\nbe underlined that Eritrea’s trouble with all its \r\nneighbours emanates essentially not from any \r\nlegitimate disagreement over boundary, but rather from \r\nthe troublesome character of its own Government. The \r\npersistent belligerence of the Eritrean Government \r\ntowards all of its neighbours — Yemen, the Sudan, \r\nEthiopia, and now its recent invasion of Djibouti — \r\ndemonstrates its unacceptable rogue conduct in our \r\nsubregion. \r\n Allow me to reiterate to the Assembly that \r\nEthiopia agrees with the Security Council’s constantly \r\naffirmed view that the primary responsibility for the \r\nresolution of the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea \r\nrests with the parties themselves. Eritrea should realize \r\nthat solutions to the boundary dispute or any other \r\ndifferences can be arrived at by the two parties only in \r\na peaceful manner. \r\n Ethiopia remains firmly committed to the \r\nprinciple that dialogue is the only way to settle all \r\noutstanding issues with Eritrea. Eritrea must \r\nunequivocally understand that the option of violence is \r\na non-starter. Its leaders need only resort to peaceful \r\nmeans of resolving whatever differences they may have \r\nwith their neighbours. Eritrea should weigh the long-\r\nterm interests of the peoples of the two countries and \r\nthe subregion in general, rather than wickedly pursuing \r\nsome imaginary short-sighted and short-lived \r\nobjectives. \r\n Mr. Desta (Eritrea): I take the floor in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply in connection with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Ethiopia. \r\n Ethiopia has made several false and \r\nunsubstantiated allegations against Eritrea, and in the \r\ninterest of time I am not going to honour them by \r\nresponding to each one. Furthermore, it is not the wish \r\nof my delegation at this late hour, during the closing of \r\nthe general debate, to enter into accusations and \r\ncounter-accusations that contribute little to the peace \r\nand security of the region. \r\nA/63/PV.16  \r\n \r\n08-53141 52 \r\n \r\n It is, however, important to set the record \r\nstraight. Had Ethiopia not reneged on its acceptance of \r\nthe Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission award \r\nwhen it was announced in 2002, and had it cooperated \r\nfully with the Commission in its implementation, the \r\nissues between the two countries could have been \r\nresolved then and there and the successful conclusion \r\nof the peace agreement would have brought the hard \r\nsuffering of both peoples to an end in 2003. \r\n It is a matter of record that Ethiopia and its \r\nappeasers did everything in their power to frustrate and \r\nundermine the authority and the decisions of the \r\nEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, established by \r\nthe parties pursuant to article 4.2 of the Algiers \r\nAgreement, in the hope of changing the award more to \r\nEthiopia’s liking. \r\n Indeed, Ethiopia chose to flout international law \r\nunder the cover of talks on normalization, third parties \r\nand the facilitation of human geography, and \r\nsometimes by comparing the Eritrea-Ethiopia \r\nsettlement mechanism to other situations, such as that \r\nbetween Cameroon and Nigeria. Those are entirely \r\ndifferent in context and mandate. They have been the \r\ngimmicks resorted to several times by Ethiopia in its \r\nattempts to escape the treaty obligations that it \r\nundertook in Algiers in the presence of eminent \r\npersonalities of the United Nations, the African Union, \r\nthe European Union, the United States, Algeria, \r\nNigeria and South Africa. Eritrea has not occupied any \r\nEthiopian land or territory. The way forward to peace \r\nand stability in the region is therefore for Ethiopia to \r\nwithdraw unequivocally from sovereign Eritrean \r\nterritories. \r\n On Somalia, it requires no elaboration to know \r\nthat Ethiopia invaded Somalia in contravention of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development decisions. Any attempt to \r\nportray as legitimate the illegal and sinister occupation \r\nof Somalia and the interferences in its affairs is a \r\nmockery. As attested to by the Somali people and \r\nseveral observers, the administration of the Union of \r\nIslamic Courts during the six months prior to the \r\noccupation brought a semblance of order and stability \r\nto the country for the first time since 1991. If left \r\nalone, the process would have allowed the Somalis to \r\nfind their own solution to their own problem. \r\n The President: We have concluded the general \r\ndebate of the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly. I thank delegations for speaking with the \r\ncandour that is required in facing challenges that will, \r\nif unchecked, bring about the end of life as we know it. \r\n We have all recognized that this debate takes \r\nplace during a particularly troubling time for the world. \r\nMany delegations have argued that we cannot continue \r\nwith business as usual. I agree. I believe that the stage \r\nis being set for changes that will bring genuine \r\ndemocracy to the United Nations. With it, we will be \r\nable to introduce profound changes that will realize the \r\npromises of the Charter to we the people. \r\n We have heard from 111 heads of State and \r\nGovernment. I am very heartened that most reflected \r\non the proposed theme for this general debate, “The \r\nimpact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger \r\nin the world as well as the need to democratize the \r\nUnited Nations”. By so doing, we have outlined once \r\nagain our priority concerns and reaffirmed our \r\nconviction that this uniquely representative body \r\nremains the most important and most democratic forum \r\nfor global debate. The General Assembly enables the \r\ndialogue that is essential to identifying and, more \r\nimportantly, to agreeing on solutions to our most \r\npressing problems, but it is only when all voices are \r\nheard that we can expect to implement truly \r\ncomprehensive solutions. \r\n As delegations all pointed out, we are meeting at \r\na time when our deeply flawed global economic system \r\nis teetering on the brink of collapse. Each of us \r\nrecognizes the seriousness of the crisis, which has its \r\nroots in a mania of selfishness that has come to \r\ndominate today’s culture of “I and mine”. We have \r\nheard more about “we and ours” during this debate. \r\nThose appealing for courage and compassion have far \r\noutnumbered those who inspire fear and distrust. \r\n The current financial turmoil is perhaps most \r\nstarkly reflected in the world food crisis that we agreed \r\nwould provide the underlying theme for this debate. It \r\nis astonishing that, after 63 years, we are still facing \r\nthe shameful fact that hundreds of millions of people \r\nsuffer from hunger and malnutrition. That is madness \r\nand reflects how upside down our priorities have \r\nbecome. Still, in recent days we have heard a number \r\nof concrete and far-ranging proposals that, if \r\nimplemented, would prevent the food crisis from \r\nbecoming a prolonged catastrophe. \r\n The input of members to the Assembly over the \r\npast two weeks is heartening. It is clear that we are \r\n A/63/PV.16\r\n \r\n53 08-53141 \r\n \r\nnow acutely aware that the confluence of crises facing \r\nus — including even many of our calamitous natural \r\ndisasters — are of human origin. As such, they require \r\nhuman solutions. Throwing our hands up in despair is \r\nnot an option. As leaders, we must join hands in \r\nsolidarity and confront our failures together. \r\n We must be brave enough to challenge the vast \r\ninequities that exist in the world; we must take steps to \r\ndefuse the time bombs that are ticking at the heart of \r\nvirtually all of our societies; and, as unappealing as it \r\nmay sound, that will require sacrifices from all of us. \r\nWe must reorder our priorities if we are to fulfil the \r\npromises of security and well-being that billions of \r\npeople have trusted in us to keep. \r\n There are undeniable signs that we are getting our \r\npriorities straight. We have decided to focus first and \r\nforemost on the most vulnerable: the billions of people \r\nwho are living in abject poverty and neglect. In that \r\nspirit, we dedicated our time to two high-level \r\nmeetings, on the special needs of Africa and on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. I was gratified to hear \r\nthe passionate calls for solidarity with our African \r\nbrothers and sisters. And the new level of concern and \r\nsupport for the Millennium Development Goals reflects \r\na deep and genuine commitment to keep our promises \r\nto those for whom prosperity remains an impossible \r\ndream. \r\n I would like here to commend His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General, for his \r\ndedication and for his tireless efforts to make those \r\nevents a real success. \r\n These high-level meetings have generated \r\nunmistakable momentum for a successful gathering in \r\nDoha in November, when we shall consolidate the \r\npromises around financing for development. Those \r\ncommitments will remain the focus of our deliberations \r\nthroughout the sixty-third session. \r\n We have heard urgent appeals for a stronger \r\nUnited Nations. We must overcome our failures of the \r\ntwentieth century and move into the twenty-first \r\ncentury with renewed confidence that this Organization \r\ncan indeed fulfil its obligations to the world. Leaders \r\nexpressed enthusiastic support for the decision by the \r\n \r\nAssembly (decision 62/557) to enter into serious \r\nnegotiations about the makeup of the Security Council \r\nin the months ahead. \r\n That discussion is central to the future of the \r\nUnited Nations. We are ready. We have agreed to hold \r\nthree thematic debates around the importance of \r\ndemocratization, not only of the Security Council, but \r\nof the Bretton Woods institutions and other \r\ninternational financial institutions as well. \r\n All of this relates to the General Assembly, the \r\nmost representative body in the world. We must restore \r\nto the Assembly the authority that was intended in the \r\nCharter. We must give meaning to the concept of the \r\nsovereign equality of all Member States proclaimed by \r\nthe Charter. If we do not have democratic rule at the \r\nUnited Nations, how can we demand it for the rest of \r\nthe world? \r\n I hope we can take to heart the appeals that we \r\nhave heard over and over again during this general \r\ndebate. Those appeals have been in various languages. \r\nThey reflect the needs of cultures even more diverse \r\nthan our 192 Member States. But they come down to \r\nan essential truth: we are all brothers and sisters and, if \r\nwe hope to climb out of the terrible mess we have \r\ncreated, we must treat each other with respect and love. \r\n Call it compassion. Call it brotherhood and \r\nsisterhood. Call it stewardship. Call it solidarity. The \r\nidea is the same in all parts of the world. We owe it to \r\none another. We owe it to Mother Earth, who is \r\nstruggling to survive our abuses. We owe it to \r\nsucceeding generations. Let us join forces to ensure \r\nthat we rise to these challenges together, setting aside \r\nour petty differences. We can — we must — make a \r\ndifference in the months ahead. And for that, we have a \r\nvery clear mandate from our heads of State or \r\nGovernment, ministers and the other high-level \r\nrepresentatives who have addressed the Assembly over \r\nthe past six days. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n \r\n May I consider that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 8? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 8.45 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
