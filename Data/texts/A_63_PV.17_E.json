In this \r\nregard, in a letter dated 29 September 2008, I informed \r\nmembers of the speakers for this opening plenary \r\nmeeting. \r\n Members will further recall that the two-day \r\nmeeting will consist of plenary meetings and a panel \r\ndiscussion. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n I am very pleased to welcome everyone to this \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting on the midterm review of \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action. Over the next two \r\ndays we will focus our attention on the impressive \r\nwork under way to ensure that landlocked developing \r\ncountries have transit transport systems to facilitate \r\ntheir access to international trade despite their physical \r\nisolation.  \r\n Earlier this week the General Assembly \r\nconcluded its general debate. I was very pleased that \r\nwe devoted our time and effort to two high-level \r\nmeetings on the special needs of Africa and on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Both \r\nmeetings were of particular interest to landlocked \r\ncountries. It is notable that nine of the fourteen \r\ncountries with the lowest human development index \r\nscores last year are landlocked.  \r\n World leaders were in agreement that the turmoil \r\nof the world’s financial markets must not jeopardize \r\nthe funding commitments made to Africa and to the \r\nMDGs. Representatives of landlocked developing \r\ncountries know more than anyone the vulnerability of \r\ntheir economies to erratic markets and soaring \r\ntransportation costs. I promise to do all that I can as \r\nA/63/PV.17  \r\n \r\n08-53281 2 \r\n \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to assure the \r\ncontinuing support of the international community for \r\nlandlocked nations.  \r\n We are living in troubled times, and billions of \r\npeople are looking to the United Nations to fulfil the \r\npromises of security and well-being that they have \r\nentrusted to us.  \r\n As I look at the accomplishments since the 2003 \r\nAlmaty Conference, I am heartened to see the central \r\nand effective role the United Nations is playing in the \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.  \r\n Facilitating negotiations and assisting in the \r\nimplementation of complex development projects is \r\nwhat the United Nations is all about. The success of the \r\nProgramme can only strengthen the United Nations at a \r\ntime when it is looking to enhance its participation in \r\ninternational economic policy-making.  \r\n The 2003 Almaty Conference aimed to forge \r\nglobal partnerships to address the special needs of the \r\ncountries concerned by tackling their continued \r\nmarginalization from the world economy in a focused, \r\nbut holistic, fashion. \r\n The resulting Almaty Programme of Action \r\noutlines a clear set of priorities for action in transit \r\npolicy issues, infrastructure development and \r\nmaintenance, international trade and trade facilitation, \r\nand international support measures.  \r\n There has been considerable progress since the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action was adopted five years \r\nago. Thanks to their cooperative efforts, donor nations, \r\na range of international, regional and subregional \r\norganizations and financial institutions have stepped up \r\ntheir targeted assistance and support for the landlocked \r\nand transit developing countries. \r\n In and of itself, the decision by the General \r\nAssembly to convene the present midterm review of \r\nthe implementation of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction reflects the commitment of the international \r\ncommunity to the Programme’s full and effective \r\nimplementation.  \r\n However, much more needs to be done to achieve \r\nthe Programme’s overarching goal of establishing \r\nefficient transit transport systems in all landlocked \r\nregions of the world.  \r\n Geographical realities, coupled with critical \r\ninfrastructure deficiencies, as well as cumbersome \r\nborder crossing procedures, continue to pose daunting \r\nimpediments to the external trade of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries.  \r\n Landlocked country export development is \r\nseverely constrained by rising transit transport costs. \r\nThese limit the range of potential exports and markets \r\nin which goods can be competitively and profitably \r\ntraded.  \r\n Today, high trade transaction costs remain the \r\nsingle most important obstacle to equitable and \r\ncompetitive access by landlocked countries to global \r\nmarkets.  \r\n This midterm review is an extremely important \r\nexercise to assess what has been achieved so far and \r\nwhat can be done better. It will guide the second half of \r\nthe implementation period of the Almaty Programme \r\nso that it can more effectively assist landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries in their effective integration in \r\nthe international trading system.  \r\n We know that success thus far has depended on a \r\nrange of partners. They have enabled the establishment \r\nof more effective transit transport systems that benefit \r\nlandlocked developing countries and their transit \r\nneighbours in all regions of the world.  \r\n The generosity and support of Member States has \r\nbeen, and will be, crucial to safeguard the progress \r\nachieved and to accelerate progress in the years ahead. \r\nIn this regard, I would like to express special thanks to \r\nMr. Yukio Takasu of Japan for his excellent work in \r\nfacilitating the negotiation process of the outcome \r\ndocument that Member States are expected to adopt \r\ntomorrow.  \r\n Let us all reaffirm in the course of this meeting \r\nthe crucial importance of these partnerships, with the \r\nUnited Nations systems chief among them. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n I now call on the Secretary-General. \r\n The Secretary-General: Last week I convened a \r\nhigh-level event on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). We used the occasion to review \r\nprogress towards attaining the MDGs. I sounded alarm \r\nbells that we were running out of time to honour \r\ncommitments made to the developing world.  \r\n The response was overwhelming. Governments, \r\nfoundations, civil society groups and businesses joined \r\n A/63/PV.17\r\n \r\n3 08-53281 \r\n \r\nhands. We managed to forge new partnerships and \r\nprepare new action plans to speed up progress. We \r\ngenerated unprecedented commitments in pledges to \r\nhelp the world’s poor. The final figures are not in yet, \r\nbut the total may be as much as $16 billion. I am now \r\nmore hopeful about attaining the MDGs by 2015. \r\n Today we are sounding alarm bells for the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. I hope for a similarly hope-\r\ninspiring response.  \r\n Too many of the landlocked developing countries \r\nare not on track to meeting the MDGs. According to \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, they \r\naccount for 10 of the 20 countries with the lowest level \r\nof human development.  \r\n It is vital that landlocked developing countries \r\nincrease their volume of exports in order to meet the \r\nMDGs. Currently the world’s 31 landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries account for less than 1 per cent of \r\nglobal merchandise trade.  \r\n The single biggest obstacle to increasing this \r\nshare is the very high cost of transport. In some \r\nlandlocked developing countries, transport costs can \r\nexceed 70 per cent of the export value. This has \r\nbecome a bigger barrier to trade than tariffs. Clearly, \r\nwe need a more vigorous effort for international \r\ncooperation. \r\n There has been some encouraging progress in \r\nimplementing the Almaty Programme. Many countries \r\nare improving transit transport policies. This is making \r\nit easier for landlocked countries to use neighbouring \r\ncountries’ ports and roads. Trade facilitation has also \r\nreduced the costs of doing business.  \r\n Much more now needs to be done in the area of \r\ninfrastructure development. Roads and railways remain \r\ninadequate. Many ports are using obsolete cargo \r\nhandling equipment. We need to mobilize more \r\ninternational support in order to improve infrastructure. \r\n The Millennium Summit of September 2000 \r\ncommitted to addressing the special needs of \r\nlandlocked developing countries. The Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action translates that commitment into \r\nspecific actions.  \r\n The United Nations supports the Almaty \r\nProgramme by working with countries to develop \r\nintegrated transport networks; modernize customs \r\noperations; build capacities for trade negotiations; and \r\ndevelop indicators for monitoring progress. We are \r\nbuilding partnerships with financial institutions and \r\nregional development banks in our activities.  \r\n The achievements so far are encouraging. But we \r\nneed full implementation by all partners in order to \r\nmake significant progress. Let us use the success of the \r\nhigh-level event on the MDGs as inspiration for this \r\nreview.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of Mongolia, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nambar Enkhbayar. \r\n President Enkhbayar: I am pleased to address \r\nthe opening meeting of the high-level meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the midterm review of \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n I strongly commend the leadership of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon in galvanizing the activities of \r\nthe United Nations system organizations in our \r\nconcerted efforts to implement the Programme. \r\nMongolia also extends its high appreciation to High \r\nRepresentative Cheick Diarra and his Office for the \r\ncoherent coordination of all the preparatory activities \r\nin the lead-up to this high-level review. \r\n Over the coming two days we will engage in an \r\nextensive discussion to take stock of the progress \r\nachieved so far in moving forward the implementation \r\nof the Almaty Programme of Action, to share the \r\nlessons learned and identify future actions to speed up \r\nits realization through addressing the still persistent \r\nconstraints. \r\n It is gratifying to note that over the last five years \r\nthe landlocked and transit developing countries, with \r\nthe support of their developed partners, have registered \r\ncertain headway in all five priority areas of the \r\nProgramme. They have strengthened their policy \r\nreform efforts, including the liberalization of transit \r\nand transport services; increased accession to relevant \r\ninternational conventions; the establishment of regional \r\ninter-modal transport corridors; and harmonization of \r\ncommon rules and standards. \r\n The international community has come to better \r\nrecognize that high transit transport costs represent a \r\nmore important barrier than most favoured nation \r\ntariffs for landlocked developing countries. As a result \r\nit is encouraging that there is a much broader \r\nrecognition of the special needs of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries per se and a stronger engagement \r\nA/63/PV.17  \r\n \r\n08-53281 4 \r\n \r\nof development partners with respect to transport \r\ninfrastructure development and trade facilitation, as \r\nwell as aid, debt relief and market access.  \r\n Multilateral and development institutions and \r\nregional organizations also tend to allocate greater \r\nattention and resources to the establishment of efficient \r\ntransit systems. All these efforts are encouraging and \r\nought to be further consolidated for the effective and \r\nfull implementation of the Programme. \r\n The past few years have been somewhat \r\nfavourable for the overall economic development and \r\ngrowth of landlocked developing countries as a group. \r\nAccording to the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/63/165), the gross domestic product of the \r\nlandlocked developing countries grew annually by \r\nalmost 8 per cent in the period 2003-2006. Foreign \r\ndirect investment has also seen a certain increase over \r\nthe same period. In addition, as of 2006 more than \r\n90 per cent of exports of landlocked developing \r\ncountries to developed markets enjoyed duty-free \r\naccess, a significant increase from 70 per cent back in \r\n2003. \r\n Despite these positive developments, landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries continue to face considerable \r\nchallenges inherently linked to their geographical \r\nhandicap. Over the past decade, their share in world \r\nexports has remained unacceptably dismal — well \r\nbelow 0.6 per cent — with commodities accounting for \r\nthe bulk of exports.  \r\n In our case, transit transport costs through Russia \r\nand China amount to up to 8 per cent of our GDP. \r\nHence, with a view to promoting a comprehensive \r\nsubregional agreement designed to harmonize transit \r\nregulations and reduce transit transport costs, Mongolia \r\nhas initiated a Tripartite Framework Agreement on \r\nTransit Transportation with its two neighbours. The \r\ndraft agreement has been agreed in principle, and \r\nnegotiations continue on annexes.  \r\n The agreement, once concluded, will provide a \r\nlegal framework for efficient transit systems to and \r\nthrough Mongolia by allowing freedom of transit by all \r\nmodes of transport and promoting simplification, \r\nharmonization and standardization of customs, \r\nadministrative procedures and documentation. \r\n Subregional and regional cooperation and \r\nintegration of landlocked developing countries and \r\ntheir transit neighbours play an important role in \r\neffectively addressing cross-border trade and transit \r\ntransport problems. In this context, we welcome the \r\nregional initiatives aimed at promoting the \r\ndevelopment of regional rail and road transit transport \r\nnetworks, including the Asian Highway and Trans-\r\nAsian Railway Agreements, to which Mongolia has \r\nalready become a party. \r\n The continued marginalization of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries from the international trading \r\nsystem prevents them from fully using trade as an \r\ninstrument for achieving the respective MDGs. It is \r\ndisheartening that the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP) Human Development Report \r\n(2007-2008) shows that 10 out of 20 of the lowest-\r\nranking countries in the human development index \r\nwere landlocked developing countries. Their situation \r\nis being further exacerbated by the current global food, \r\nenergy and financial crises.  \r\n In this regard, we need to seize this opportunity \r\nof reviewing the implementation of the Programme to \r\nexplore new avenues on how to urgently respond to \r\nthese global development challenges, both existing and \r\nemerging. \r\n Increased international assistance for export \r\ndiversification, infrastructure development, \r\ninstitutional capacity-building and better market access \r\nare essential for landlocked developing countries. As \r\nhigh transaction cost represents the main cause of the \r\nmarginalization of these countries from the \r\ninternational trading system, the current negotiations \r\non market access for agricultural and non-agricultural \r\ngoods should, in our view, give particular attention to \r\nproducts from landlocked developing countries.  \r\n In addition, trade facilitation negotiations, \r\nespecially the part on GATT article V, present an \r\nopportunity to set internationally applicable rules and \r\nstandards that are most urgently needed. In this respect, \r\nI reiterate my earlier proposal, voiced at the \r\nUlaanbaatar thematic meeting last year to consider \r\nnegotiating a separate, multilateral agreement on issues \r\ncovered by GATT Article V on Freedom of Transit. \r\n The Ulaanbaatar meeting on trade and trade \r\nfacilitation and the Burkina Faso meeting on \r\ninfrastructure development constitute an important part \r\nof the substantive preparations in the run-up to this \r\nmidterm review. I gather that the publications on the \r\noutcome of these thematic meetings are being launched \r\nby the Office of the High Representative. \r\n A/63/PV.17\r\n \r\n5 08-53281 \r\n \r\n With a view to maximizing the efficiency of our \r\ncoordinated efforts in promoting the interests of \r\nlandlocked developing countries, including effective \r\nand full implementation of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction, I recently proposed to set up an international \r\nthink-tank and offered to host it in Ulaanbaatar. I am \r\npleased that this initiative has enjoyed active support \r\nfrom our fellow members of the group.  \r\n We are also hopeful that the relevant bodies of \r\nthe United Nations system and international and \r\nregional financial institutions, along with our \r\ndevelopment partners, will step in to ensure its \r\nefficient and effective functioning. \r\n As for the national implementation of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action, Mongolia has introduced several \r\ninnovative measures to build policy framework and to \r\npromote public-private partnership. On my initiative, \r\nthe MDG-based National Development Strategy — a \r\ncomprehensive mid- and long-term development \r\nblueprint — was approved earlier this year. The \r\nStrategy makes human development and modernization \r\nof infrastructure as a key priority for making Mongolia \r\na middle-income country by 2021. \r\n Furthermore, a National Committee on Trade and \r\nTransport Facilitation, set in motion in 2005, is \r\nentrusted with a mandate to serve as a nationwide \r\ncoordinator for the Programme’s implementation. It is \r\ncomposed of representatives of government, the private \r\nsector, academia and non-governmental organizations \r\nto ensure a broad-based partnership.  \r\n Also, with active participation of all stakeholders, \r\nMongolia has developed a comprehensive sector \r\ndevelopment Programme called Transit Mongolia \r\nincorporating all Programme priorities and Mongolia-\r\nspecific goals. Hence, we believe that creation of a \r\ndesignated institutional mechanism along with the \r\nrelevant plan of action lays a sound foundation for the \r\nProgramme’s effective implementation. In addition, \r\nactive engagement of investors, both foreign and \r\nnational, and the local business community helps to \r\nbetter mobilize the needed resources, both financial \r\nand human. \r\n Finally, I wish to emphasize the crucial role of \r\nregional and international cooperation in ensuring \r\neffective implementation of the Programme. In this \r\nregard, my delegation fully endorses the related \r\nprovisions in the draft outcome document to be \r\nadopted at the end of our review meeting.  \r\n We commend the considerable efforts made by \r\nUnited Nations bodies, in particular that of the Office \r\nof the High Representative, in coordinating system-\r\nwide activities towards Programme implementation. \r\nWe also acknowledge the important work and support \r\nprovided by our development partners, both bilateral \r\nand multilateral, including the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), \r\nthe United Nations Industrial Development \r\nOrganization (UNIDO), the regional commissions, the \r\nWorld Bank and the regional development banks. \r\n I wish the Assembly a successful review with a \r\nproductive outcome. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the \r\nPresident of Mongolia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Hamed Diane Semega, Minister of Equipment and \r\nTransport of Mali. \r\n Mr. Semega (Mali) (spoke in French): As Mali’s \r\nMinister of Equipment and Transport, and chairman of \r\nthe Mali delegation, I wish on behalf of Mr. Amadou \r\nToumani Touré, President of the Republic of Mali and \r\nChairman of the Group of the Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries, to convey his fraternal greetings.  \r\n I also, on behalf of the 31 members of our Group, \r\nsalute Mr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, who has energetically \r\nand skilfully led the work of the Group since its \r\nfoundation in 1994. His mandate has certainly yielded \r\npositive results; suffice it to recall his valuable, \r\ndecisive role in the adoption of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action.  \r\n In addition, I thank the President of Kazakhstan, \r\nMr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, whose country hosted \r\nthe International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked \r\nand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries \r\nand International Financial and Development \r\nInstitutions on Transit Transport Cooperation, a \r\nhistoric meeting, whose recommendations are \r\nenshrined in what is now known as the Almaty \r\nProgramme.  \r\n The Group of the Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries expresses its gratitude to Ambassador \r\nChowdhury, who, as Under-Secretary-General with \r\nresponsibility for landlocked developing countries, \r\nshowed a constant commitment and total devotion to \r\nA/63/PV.17  \r\n \r\n08-53281 6 \r\n \r\nhis noble mission and produced many relevant \r\ninitiatives.  \r\n Finally, I warmly congratulate my compatriot \r\nAmbassador Cheick Sidi Diarra on the lofty mission \r\nwhich Mr Ban Ki-moon has entrusted to him.  \r\n The midterm review of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction that we are beginning comes five years after its \r\nadoption by resolution 58/201 of 23 December 2003.  \r\n The problems of development must be analysed \r\nwithin the framework of the globalization of \r\neconomies. The landlocked developing countries are no \r\nexception. To the contrary, most of us are excluded \r\nfrom international trade, and those which do take part \r\nare largely at the mercy of the vicissitudes of the world \r\neconomy.  \r\n I believe that it will be useful to outline the \r\nserious constraints imposed by geography on our \r\ncountries in their struggle for economic and social \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n A few figures speak for themselves. The \r\n31 landlocked developing countries cover 12.5 per cent \r\nof the surface of the globe, with their 16.3 million \r\nsquare kilometres, and have 370 million inhabitants, or \r\n5.5 per cent of the world’s population, which is \r\nestimated to be more than 6 billion, yet they generate \r\nonly 2 per cent of the gross world product. Their \r\nfundamental characteristic is their distance from the \r\nsea, resulting in excessive transport costs. Kazakhstan \r\nis the landlocked country most distant from the sea, \r\nwith its nearest accessible port 3,750 kilometres away. \r\nIt is true that there are certain differences between our \r\ncountries, which include some oil producers and \r\nexporters.  \r\n The external debt of the landlocked developing \r\ncountries is becoming harder and harder to sustain. As \r\nto external trade, their competitiveness is greatly \r\naffected by everything to do with transport and transit. \r\nTherefore, with limited export resources, we must \r\ndeplore the limited and very poorly diversified supply \r\ncapacities, which usually result in only poor products. \r\nA consequence for the developing countries is a \r\nnotorious weakness of their physical infrastructure, \r\nwhose development is too costly for their budgets. \r\n One last figure: the landlocked developing \r\ncountries have transaction costs linked to transport \r\naveraging between 15 per cent and 25 per cent, about \r\ntwice those of transit countries and more than three \r\ntimes those of the developed countries. \r\n With all those facts, the challenges we face have \r\nnever been so difficult as they are today. Three crises, \r\nincluding the international financial crisis, have hit us \r\nin swift succession, particularly in the last two years. If \r\nthey have severely shaken the developed countries and \r\nless fragile developing countries, it is easy to imagine \r\nhow much they threaten the very socio-economic and \r\npolitical foundations of the landlocked developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n If the international community does not react \r\nwith more determination and more consistently, the \r\nsacrifices made by the landlocked developing \r\ncountries, together with our partners, will have been in \r\nvain. The encouraging results registered by these \r\ncountries for more than a decade, particularly in \r\nrestructuring and adapting their economies to the \r\ndemands of globalization, will thus be wasted.  \r\n We are here at the midterm review to make \r\nclearly understood the strong apprehensions expressed \r\nin our countries and to mobilize the international \r\ncommunity. The worsening situation of our countries \r\nrequires action by all, particularly by the developed \r\ncountries, but also, to a lesser extent, by the emerging \r\ncountries.  \r\n In his report of 13 August 2007, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral stated: \r\n “The midterm review of the implementation \r\nof the Almaty Programme of Action is an \r\nimportant exercise aimed at determining, among \r\nother things, what has been achieved so far, what \r\ncould have been done better and how the second \r\nhalf of the implementation period can be \r\neffectively utilized to advance on the ultimate \r\ngoal of assisting landlocked developing \r\ncountries.” (A/62/226, para. 23) \r\n With globalization becoming more manifest every \r\nday, countries must be increasingly competitive in \r\norder to play a bigger part in the world’s multilateral \r\ntrade system, through the World Trade Organization, \r\nwhose rules provide instruments allowing the \r\ndeveloping countries to prepare themselves better for \r\nglobal competition.  \r\n By way of example I would mention the special \r\nand differential treatment, which, beyond granting \r\ntransition periods to come up to the required level, will \r\n A/63/PV.17\r\n \r\n7 08-53281 \r\n \r\nmake possible the granting of a period of time to \r\nimplement technical assistance and strengthen the \r\ncapacities of the landlocked developing countries.  \r\n In this regard, on behalf of the Group of the \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries, I warmly thank the \r\nWorld Bank and the World Trade Organization for \r\nsupporting our countries in establishing a methodology \r\nfor self-evaluation of national situations. Such analysis \r\nwill make possible notification of the time needed to \r\nimplement their obligations and particularly details of \r\ntechnical assistance and strengthening of the necessary \r\ncapacities. \r\n My thanks also go to the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development for setting up a \r\nnegotiating group of our countries and strengthening \r\ntheir capacity to familiarize national experts with the \r\nmachinery of trade negotiations. \r\n Today’s meeting gives me an opportunity to \r\nthank, for their constant support, the whole United \r\nNations family, and particularly the Secretary-General, \r\nwhose support in various forms has undoubtedly made \r\nit possible to advance towards implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme. \r\n I also thank the Office of the High Representative \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing \r\nStates, mandated by Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, to organize this review and coordinate the \r\npreparatory work, and I congratulate it on the clarity \r\nand effectiveness of this action. \r\n I conclude with an African saying: When two \r\nelephants fight, it is the savannah grass that suffers. In \r\nthe context of globalization, the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction is certainly not a magic wand, but its full and \r\nactive implementation will make it possible for the \r\nlandlocked developing countries not to be the grass \r\ncrushed in the vacant lot of globalization, by \r\npermitting them to take part in global economic \r\ncompetition. That would be justice. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of India. \r\n Mr. Mukherjee (India): The Almaty Programme \r\nof Action has resulted in a clear acknowledgement of \r\nthe special needs and problems of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, including the need for sustained \r\ninternational support to address them. \r\n Equally important is the understanding that any \r\neffective solution must address the constraints and \r\nchallenges faced by the transit developing countries \r\nneighbouring landlocked developing countries. \r\n Yet our review shows that the devil does indeed \r\nlie in the details of the implementation. \r\n Despite their best efforts, landlocked developing \r\ncountries have not been able to take full advantage of \r\nthe global growth witnessed since Almaty, and many of \r\nthem remain marginalized from the international \r\ntrading system. \r\n Modernization of trade facilitation and transit \r\nprocedures remains pending, primarily due to lack of \r\ntheir own resources and capacities and financial and \r\ntechnical assistance. \r\n Thus it is no coincidence that of the \r\n31 landlocked developing countries 16 continue to be \r\nclassified as least developed countries. The current \r\nglobal food and energy crises have made their \r\nproblems more acute. \r\n It is therefore imperative that we utilize this \r\nopportunity to make a genuine assessment of \r\nchallenges to the implementation of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n Various reports by the United Nations and other \r\nbodies clearly identify lack of resources as a key \r\nbarrier to implementation of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction. \r\n Transit transport infrastructure projects involve \r\nhigh investments and long gestation periods, usually \r\nwith low rates of return and comparative higher risks. \r\n Naturally, it becomes difficult to attract private \r\nsector investment, particularly in countries where the \r\nprivate sector itself is not well developed. \r\n Official development assistance (ODA) therefore \r\nremains critical for long-term funding. Yet, regrettably, \r\nODA to the transport sector has actually fallen in the \r\nlandlocked developing countries. \r\n Moreover, infrastructure development needs to be \r\ncomplemented by efficient storage and logistics \r\nmanagement systems and integrated information and \r\ncommunication networks. It also requires seamless \r\nintegration of transport infrastructures of landlocked \r\ncountries with the transit transport infrastructure of \r\ntheir transit developing countries, as well as with any \r\nA/63/PV.17  \r\n \r\n08-53281 8 \r\n \r\nspecial transit transport corridor. Inter-modal transport \r\nalso needs to be encouraged. All these require \r\nsignificant financial and technical assistance, as well as \r\ncapacity-building. \r\n Transit developing countries themselves face \r\nmany development challenges. Yet they take on \r\nadditional costs of providing transit transport facilities \r\nto landlocked countries even when areas in their own \r\ncountries remain as remote from the sea as those of the \r\nlandlocked countries. While the transit developing \r\ncountries undertake this in a spirit of cooperation and \r\nfriendship, they also need to be provided enhanced \r\ninternational support. \r\n Other assistance envisaged in the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action has also been limited. Debt relief \r\nhas not translated into additional resources, since much \r\nof the debt was already in arrears. Technology transfer \r\nhas not been effective. We need to put in place a \r\nproactive mechanism that promotes technology transfer \r\nat concessional and preferential rates. \r\n Enhancing international trade from landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries and transit developing countries \r\nis crucial for their development. This requires an \r\nenabling international environment. Developed \r\ncountries need to provide enhanced market access to \r\nproducts of special interest to landlocked developing \r\ncountries and transit developing countries. The \r\noverarching principle of the special and differential \r\ntreatment remains a categorical imperative. \r\n Trade and transit issues are inextricably linked. \r\nEnhancement of trade facilitation, customs control \r\nefficiency and simplification of documentation and \r\nprocedures for international trade require technical and \r\nfinancial assistance. \r\n We must also remain cognizant that there are \r\nsignificant regional variations in implementing the \r\nAlmaty Programme, and one size cannot fit all. \r\nBilateral initiatives, where appropriate, also play a key \r\nrole. \r\n The enhanced focus on challenges facing \r\nlandlocked developing countries has highlighted that \r\nthere are regions within some developing countries that \r\nhave difficulty in accessing global markets on account \r\nof geography or political boundaries. This lack of easy \r\naccess to the sea and remoteness from international \r\nmarkets causes them to face challenges similar to those \r\nfaced by landlocked developing countries. It would be \r\nappropriate to recognize the need and call for \r\ncooperation to meet the special transit requirements of \r\nlandlocked regions of a country. \r\n We have excellent historical ties with our \r\nlandlocked neighbours, and accord the highest \r\nimportance to further strengthening these links, \r\nincluding through cooperation on transit transport \r\nissues. We have also contributed to the development \r\nefforts of other landlocked developing countries and \r\ntransit developing countries as part of South-South \r\ncooperation. \r\n Landlocked countries with a contiguous border \r\nwith us have special bilateral cooperation agreements \r\nfor easy transit of their goods through India. \r\n Regional initiatives to improve transit \r\nconnectivity and intraregional trade are equally a \r\npriority for us. We also continue to join our landlocked \r\nneighbours in financial partnerships for infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, and make available technical, economic \r\nand capacity-building support. \r\n We hope that this midterm review will invigorate \r\nthe implementation of the Almaty Programme, \r\nincluding the provision of enhanced assistance from \r\nthe international community. \r\n Before I conclude let me thank Mr. Cheick Sidi \r\nDiarra, Under-Secretary-General and High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, and his team for the excellent work \r\nthey are doing, and their efforts in making this review \r\nmeeting a success. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Hans Winkler, State \r\nSecretary for European and International Affairs of \r\nAustria. \r\n Mr. Winkler (Austria): First, I would like to \r\nexpress my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to \r\naddress the Assembly in this debate on landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, which I consider not only timely, \r\nbut also of the utmost importance. \r\n Despite real progress towards the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nespecially in the area of poverty reduction, it is still the \r\nleast developed countries, the landlocked developing \r\ncountries and the small island States that are the most \r\nadversely affected. They need our paramount attention, \r\n A/63/PV.17\r\n \r\n9 08-53281 \r\n \r\nas the relevant reports on the implementation and \r\nprogress of the MDGs point out. \r\n The year 2008 has seen a number of important \r\nevents on development cooperation with participation \r\nat the political level, including many Heads of State \r\nand Government. I personally attended the twelfth \r\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment and the High-Level Forum on Aid \r\nEffectiveness, both held in Accra earlier this year, \r\nwhich confirmed that the group of States that we are \r\naddressing today indeed require our special attention.  \r\n I also recall the Africa and Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal summits of the General Assembly, \r\nheld a few days ago, which the Austrian Federal \r\nPresident and the Austrian Federal Chancellor \r\nattended.  \r\n Moreover, we are currently preparing the Doha \r\nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, which will take place at the end \r\nof November through the beginning of December. \r\n All these high-level meetings would have been of \r\nno avail if not followed by concrete action. Therefore, \r\nit is high time now to substantially increase our \r\ncommon efforts — developed and developing countries \r\nalike — in order to reach the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) for all countries and peoples in the \r\nworld. \r\n Austria views the Almaty Programme of Action \r\nas a significant landmark in the recognition of the \r\nspecial needs and problems of landlocked developing \r\ncountries. Our common goal must be to effectively \r\nintegrate them into the world economy. That is a \r\nprecondition for poverty-reduction and achievement of \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n At the midpoint of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction we must take stock of where we stand in our \r\ncommon efforts to support landlocked developing \r\ncountries in overcoming their development constraints. \r\n Thirty-one landlocked developing countries in the \r\nworld continue to face serious constraints in their \r\nefforts to achieve the goals of fighting poverty and \r\nelevating the living standards of their population. \r\nAccording to the 2007-2008 Human Development \r\nIndex rankings, eight of the 12 countries with the \r\nlowest Human Development Index scores are \r\nlandlocked, 10 landlocked countries are classified as \r\namong those with low human development, and not a \r\nsingle one of the non-European landlocked countries is \r\nclassified among those with high human development. \r\n One reason why economic and human \r\ndevelopment indicators for landlocked countries are \r\ngenerally so much worse than those for their maritime \r\nneighbours is their dependence on other countries’ \r\ntransit routes for access to overseas markets.  \r\n Landlocked developing countries in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica are especially adversely affected. The isolation \r\nfrom world markets, poor infrastructure, \r\ncommunication problems and logistics delays \r\nsignificantly increase the costs for African firms and \r\nimpose an additional burden on their economies. The \r\ncost penalties borne by the private sector, particularly \r\nfor transport and energy, are daunting, more than \r\nwiping out any comparative advantages these countries \r\nmight have, such as lower labour costs. \r\n Allow me to share Austria’s experience as a \r\nlandlocked, predominantly mountainous country in the \r\nmiddle of Europe. Our geopolitical situation after the \r\nSecond World War — at the border between two \r\ndifferent political and economic systems — proved to \r\nbe an obstacle to trade and economic integration. The \r\nfall of the Berlin Wall and the removal of the Iron \r\nCurtain in 1989, Austria’s membership in the European \r\nUnion, from 1995, and the enlargement of the \r\nEuropean Union towards Eastern Europe provided \r\nAustria with unprecedented economic opportunities \r\nand welfare for its population. \r\n Our example shows that not only the right \r\neconomic and social environment but also enabling \r\ngeopolitical conditions are required to further regional \r\nintegration and cooperation. Today, as a member of the \r\nEuropean Union, Austria has access to all ports of \r\nEuropean Union member States across roads, railways \r\nand inland navigation. Transit and access to the Black \r\nSea ports are ensured on the basis of the Danube \r\nConvention, which regulates and guarantees free traffic \r\non the Danube. \r\n During the Third United Nations Conference on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 \r\nthrough 1982, Austria chaired the group of the \r\nso-called geographically disadvantaged States, most of \r\nthem landlocked developing countries. In this position, \r\nAustria represented their interests, mainly \r\nconcentrating on participation in research regarding the \r\nuse of marine resources, representation in the entities \r\nA/63/PV.17  \r\n \r\n08-53281 10 \r\n \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea and the question of transit rights and access to the \r\nsea.  \r\n European integration provided valuable \r\nassistance to us. Joint planning of transport facilities \r\nand routes, as well as collective financial aid to support \r\nprojects in the infrastructure sector, makes it possible \r\nto combat the negative environmental effects of transit \r\ntraffic.  \r\n Because of our own history and experience, \r\nAustria focuses its development cooperation with \r\npartners in landlocked developing countries such as \r\nBurkina Faso, Uganda, Ethiopia, Bhutan, Moldova and \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Special \r\nemphasis is given to supporting regional infrastructure \r\ndevelopment in sub-Saharan Africa and to contributing \r\nto the European Union-Africa Trust Fund on \r\nInfrastructure.  \r\n On the basis of our own experience, and because \r\nthis is supported by statistics and facts, I would like to \r\nstress the significance of regional integration. It cannot \r\nbe stressed enough. It provides security and peace, and \r\nprevents crisis through common political and economic \r\nstability and a common legal framework, which \r\nconstitute the basic prerequisites for transit and free \r\naccess to the sea. \r\n With that in mind, I conclude, Mr. President, by \r\nwishing you — and us all — a successful meeting. \r\nThe meeting rose at 11.15 a.m. \r\n"
