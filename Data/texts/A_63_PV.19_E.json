I also wish \r\nto express my appreciation to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for the insightful report (A/63/165) before us. \r\nI believe that the report will serve to guide us well. It \r\nsuccinctly summarizes the progress made, the lessons \r\nlearned and the constraints encountered in the \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.  \r\n Five years ago, in Almaty, Kazakhstan, the \r\nparticipants at the International Ministerial Conference \r\ncame up with a comprehensive road map to galvanize \r\ninternational solidarity and partnership to assist \r\nlandlocked developing countries (LLDCs). The \r\noutcome of the Conference, the Almaty Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action, reflected the strong \r\ncommitment of the international community to address \r\nthe special needs of and challenges faced by \r\nlandlocked developing countries, as called for in the \r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration. \r\n In that regard, my delegation takes note of the \r\nSecretary-General’s overall assessment that, over the \r\npast five years, landlocked and transit developing \r\ncountries, with the support of their development \r\npartners, have made tangible progress in implementing \r\nthe specific actions agreed upon in the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n As a nation that has struggled against the poverty \r\ntrap during the last several decades, the Republic of \r\nKorea sympathizes with the hardships of the \r\nlandlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and is \r\ncommitted to supporting their efforts to achieve \r\nsustainable development. The new Government of the \r\nRepublic of Korea has made contributing to the \r\ninternational community as a trusted partner one of the \r\npillars of its foreign policy. To that end, we are \r\nstrengthening our role in official development \r\nassistance (ODA) programmes.  \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 2 \r\n \r\n Since 2000, our ODA has tripled in volume, with \r\nour assistance to Africa increasing threefold over the \r\npast three years. We now plan to triple our current \r\nODA to reach over $3 billion by the end of 2015. As \r\nODA remains the major source of funding for \r\ninfrastructure development in landlocked countries, \r\nthis record scale-up of our ODA volume will contribute \r\nto helping those countries to overcome geographical \r\nimpediments and pave the way for tangible economic \r\ngrowth and prosperity. \r\n Trade has long been recognized as the engine for \r\ndevelopment. The Republic of Korea has long utilized \r\ntrade as a locomotive for our economic growth. \r\nAgainst this backdrop, we are well aware of the pivotal \r\nrole that trade can play in the a country’s development. \r\nIn this context, my Government extends duty-free and \r\nquota-free access to least developed countries. At \r\npresent, 16 out of 31 landlocked developing countries \r\nenjoy the programme my Government provides. We \r\nwill also increase our contribution to the Integrated \r\nFramework for LDCs and will expand our training \r\nprogrammes on the rules and regulations of the World \r\nTrade Organization. \r\n Efficient transport infrastructure and services are \r\nprerequisites for the development of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries and will facilitate their \r\nintegration into the international trading system and the \r\nlarger global economy. However, there are still large \r\ngaps in terms of financing that cannot be addressed \r\nwithout the involvement of the private sector. To \r\ngalvanize the flow of private capital into infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, last year the Korean Government hosted \r\nthe Ministerial Conference on Public-Private \r\nPartnerships for Infrastructure Development. The \r\nMinisterial Conference on Transport held in Korea in \r\n2006 was yet another effort of my Government to \r\ncontribute to the cause of infrastructure development. \r\n The digital divide also remains of major concern \r\nfor landlocked developing countries, with only \r\n2.9 Internet users per 100 inhabitants in 2006. If this \r\ngap continues to widen, it may evolve into a serious \r\nobstacle that prevents landlocked developing countries \r\nfrom virtually engaging in the international economic \r\nsystem, which is increasingly dependent on \r\ninformation and communication technologies. In this \r\nregard, the Republic of Korea is ready to do its part to \r\nbridge the digital divide by sharing the technology and \r\nknow-how that have helped us to enjoy the largest \r\nconcentration of broadband Internet users in the world.  \r\n All in all, this midterm review shows that, \r\nalthough some progress has been made, much more \r\nneeds to be done to fulfil the commitments we pledged \r\nto keep in the Almaty Programme of Action. The \r\ndevelopment of landlocked developing countries \r\ncannot be realized through the efforts of any single \r\nplayer. Rather, it requires the joint efforts of \r\nlandlocked and transit developing countries, the \r\ninternational community and the United Nations.  \r\n I can assure the Assembly that the Republic of \r\nKorea, together with other development partners, will \r\nstand firmly with landlocked developing countries. We \r\nwill support their noble endeavours to overcome the \r\nspecial problems caused by their lack of territorial \r\naccess to the sea and their remoteness and isolation \r\nfrom world markets. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Yao Wenlong, representative of China. \r\n Mr. Yao Wenlong (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation offers its congratulations on \r\nthe successful convening of this meeting. It associates \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina and would like to express its appreciation to \r\nUnder-Secretary-General Diarra and the Office of the \r\nHigh Representative for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States for the all they have \r\ndone in preparation for this meeting. \r\n Since the implementation of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action began five years ago, landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries have, thanks to the vigorous \r\nsupport of the international community, including the \r\ntransit developing countries, and by virtue of their own \r\nunremitting efforts, made noticeable progress in their \r\neconomic and social development. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/63/165) shows that, for landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, between 2003 and 2006, gross \r\ndomestic product, foreign direct investment, and \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) grew by an \r\nannual average of 8 per cent, 11.55 per cent and \r\n21.4 per cent, respectively — higher than the averages \r\nfor the developing countries as a group in the same \r\nperiod. Those figures clearly prove that the Programme \r\nof Action has played an important role in promoting \r\nthe economic and social development of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n3 08-53512 \r\n \r\n What cannot be ignored, however, is the fact that \r\nthere has not been a fundamental change in those \r\ncountries’ disadvantaged position in the world \r\neconomic system. Nor has there been a fundamental \r\nimprovement with respect to their special difficulties, \r\nsuch as inefficient transport, weak infrastructure and \r\nhigh costs of trade. Since 2007 in particular, three \r\nintractable problems — in the fields of finance, energy \r\nand food — erupted onto the scene in quick succession, \r\nmaking the development challenges facing landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries more acute and adding to the \r\nuncertainty of their development environment.  \r\n In 2007, landlocked developing countries \r\naccounted for less than 1 per cent of international \r\ntrade, constituted half of the 20 countries with the \r\nlowest human development index, and represented \r\n9 out of the 10 countries with the world’s highest  \r\nper-container cost for import-export trade. What is \r\nmore, the recent hikes in energy prices have \r\nsignificantly increased the transit transport costs of \r\nlandlocked developing countries. There is still a long \r\nway to go before all objectives contained in the \r\nProgramme of Action are fully met. \r\n It is the consensus of the international community \r\nthat landlocked developing countries should be assisted \r\nin attaining sustainable development. In the face of the \r\ndifficulties presented by world economic development, \r\nit is of great significance that we are gathered here for \r\nthe midterm review of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction. We should use this midterm review as an \r\nopportunity to systematically assess the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, \r\ncomprehensively prioritize our future cooperation, \r\npush for the follow-up of relevant commitments and set \r\nout to respond to new development challenges. With \r\nthat in mind, China proposes that the international \r\ncommunity focus its attention on the following \r\nendeavours. \r\n First, political commitments should be \r\nreaffirmed. The Almaty Programme of Action \r\nembodies the international community’s firm resolve \r\nand solemn commitment to help landlocked developing \r\ncountries and constitutes the specific plan of action and \r\nthe basic framework of cooperation for that purpose. \r\nWe must take this as central in furthering the spirit of \r\nglobal partnership, honouring all commitments made \r\nunder the Programme of Action and comprehensively \r\nsupporting the sustainable development of those \r\ncountries. \r\n Secondly, we must actively respond to \r\nchallenges. The implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction should keep pace with the times. The relevant \r\ninternational agencies should systematically assess the \r\nimpact and repercussions of new development \r\nchallenges for landlocked and transit developing \r\ncountries. For its part, the international community \r\nshould focus on helping those two groups of countries \r\nmeet such new challenges as climate change, the world \r\neconomic slowdown, the turbulence in the financial \r\nmarkets and the surge in energy prices. \r\n Thirdly, development assistance should be \r\nincreased. Development assistance represents a crucial \r\nfactor in efforts to help landlocked developing \r\ncountries break out of their development difficulties. \r\nThe international community, and developed donor \r\ncountries in particular, should reverse the trend seen in \r\nrecent years of declining rather than increasing ODA. \r\nThe commitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross \r\nnational income (GNI) to ODA should be expeditiously \r\ntranslated into action, effectively increasing the share \r\nof ODA dedicated to the financing of infrastructure \r\ndevelopment and other production sectors. The scale, \r\nsustainability and predictability of funding should \r\ncontinue to be increased. \r\n Fourthly, trade preferences should be augmented. \r\nTrade is an important engine for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of landlocked developing countries. The \r\ninternational community should vigorously push for an \r\nearly resumption of the World Trade Organization \r\nDoha Round of negotiations and an early conclusion of \r\na package agreement that genuinely reflects the theme \r\nof development. It should continue to expand trade \r\nfacilitation and preferences in favour of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries and, through assistance in trade \r\nand other measures, support them in building their \r\ntrade capacity so that they can significantly engage in \r\nthe international trade system and benefit from it. \r\n Fifthly, cooperation mechanisms should be \r\nstrengthened. Well-coordinated cooperation \r\nmechanisms constitute the institutional guarantee for \r\nthe successful implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction. The international community should continue \r\nto strengthen policy coordination and information-\r\nsharing, effectively promote regional and subregional \r\neconomic cooperation, vigorously support public-\r\nprivate cooperation and explore in depth innovative \r\nfinancing mechanisms. Meanwhile, the Office of the \r\nHigh Representative should also continue to promote \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 4 \r\n \r\ncooperation and coordination between the relevant \r\ninternational organizations and United Nations \r\nagencies. \r\n China is a transit developing country, and parts of \r\nits territory have landlocked features. Some of our \r\ninland provinces have worse natural conditions than \r\nsome landlocked countries. China thus has first-hand \r\nexperience of the special difficulties confronting \r\nlandlocked developing countries. China has always \r\nenergetically supported landlocked developing \r\ncountries in their development efforts, actively \r\npromoted and engaged in transit transport cooperation, \r\ncontinuously strengthened support measures in favour \r\nof those countries and actively honoured the \r\ncommitments made under the Programme of Action.  \r\n Currently, China contributes more than 10 per \r\ncent of world economic growth, with the spillover \r\neffects providing a powerful impetus to the economic \r\ngrowth of neighbouring landlocked developing \r\ncountries. China is active in advancing regional \r\neconomic cooperation in Central Asia, North-East Asia \r\nand the Greater Mekong subregion. That cooperation \r\nbenefits the landlocked developing countries in Asia. \r\nThrough mechanisms such as the Forum on China-\r\nAfrica Cooperation, we have also continued to increase \r\nour support for the landlocked developing countries in \r\nAfrica. At the United Nations high-level event on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals last week, Premier \r\nWen Jiabao announced six concrete measures that we \r\nare undertaking to provide assistance within our \r\ncapacity to fellow developing countries, including \r\nlandlocked developing countries, in the areas of \r\nagricultural development, responding to the food crisis, \r\npersonnel training, debt relief and cancellation, trade \r\npreferences and energy.  \r\n China will continue to follow the principles of \r\nequitable consultation, mutual interest and benefit and \r\ncommon development, to honour in full and in depth \r\nall commitments contained in the Programme of Action \r\nand to share development opportunities with \r\nlandlocked developing countries in a joint effort to \r\nmeet the challenges of development. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Giadalla A. Ettalhi, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya. \r\n Mr. Ettalhi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, we would like to express our \r\ndeep appreciation for the timely holding of this \r\nmeeting and to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. \r\n The special needs and problems confronting \r\nlandlocked developing countries have been recognized \r\nby the United Nations in the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), as well as by other relevant \r\ninternational organizations. They include the fact that \r\nthose countries do not have access to the sea and suffer \r\nisolation from international markets, which has a \r\nnegative impact on their development efforts and \r\nconstrains their ability to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and on their development \r\nefforts in general. That is all well known. \r\n The Almaty Programme of Action aims to \r\nconfront the challenges faced by landlocked and transit \r\ndeveloping countries. The Programme clearly indicates \r\nthat landlocked status is a challenge, not a destiny, and \r\nthat international solidarity and cooperation can \r\ncontribute to overcoming those difficulties and \r\nchallenges. Many transit developing countries that are \r\nneighbours of landlocked developing countries bear \r\nadditional burdens as a result of transit transport \r\nrequirements and their need to build and strengthen the \r\ninfrastructure for roads, maintenance and service \r\nprogrammes as well as to develop the human resources \r\nand administrative and financial systems needed for \r\nthose facilities. \r\n Therefore, the formation, strengthening and \r\nmaintenance of an effective transit system pose a great \r\nchallenge to landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) \r\nand to other developing countries as well. This is what \r\nmy country, Libya, is facing. \r\n The costs entailed are often greater than the \r\nfinancial capabilities of those countries and there is no \r\ndoubt that development partners can support and \r\nbolster those countries’ efforts to create effective \r\nmeans and systems of transit transport and develop the \r\nrequired human resources and capabilities. We affirm \r\nthat regional cooperation can play an important role in \r\nresolving the problems encountered in transit transport, \r\nmaking it easier and less costly by allowing for the \r\npooling of resources and capabilities, and by \r\ncoordinating and removing obstacles to cross-border \r\npassage and by guaranteeing that products have access \r\nto nearby and overseas markets. It is gratifying that the \r\ndevelopment of basic infrastructure for transit transport \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n5 08-53512 \r\n \r\nis one of the national concerns of African countries. It \r\nis also among the strategic priorities of development. \r\nWe support the policies and initiatives made by the \r\nAfrican Union, the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment and regional economic groupings in the \r\nAfrican continent, all of which aim to bolster the \r\nefforts of those countries and strengthen regional \r\ncooperation among them. \r\n We confirm the need to establish and bolster \r\neffective systems for transit transport in Africa by \r\nforging effective partnerships between LLDCs and \r\ntransit developing countries within the framework of \r\nregional integration. We call upon international and \r\nregional financial institutions to offer more financial \r\nand technical aid. This aid should be coordinated to \r\ndevelop the infrastructure of transit transport and to \r\nfocus on bridging the gaps that remain in ground \r\ntransport networks so as to connect landlocked \r\ncountries to the rest of the African countries and give \r\npriority to the basic infrastructure needs within the \r\nframework of assistance for trade. Additionally, \r\noverseas development assistance funds allocated to \r\nbuilding these structures should be increased. \r\n In view of its belief in the need for African \r\nintegration, Libya supports policies and initiatives that \r\naim to connect African countries through roads and \r\nnetworks, as these are fundamental to the development \r\nand advancement of the productive and service sectors \r\nin landlocked countries. Additionally, they would \r\nactivate trade exchange with the rest of the countries in \r\nthe continent, on one hand, and trade between those \r\ncountries and international markets, on the other. \r\n Moreover, my country has undertaken a large \r\nproject called the Al-Qadhafi Highway. Here, my \r\ncountry is working on building desert roads to \r\nlandlocked countries on two axes, one in eastern Libya \r\nand one in the west of the country. We are currently \r\ndevoting great efforts to implement this large project. \r\nSuch efforts contribute to providing opportunities for \r\neconomic and social stability. This will reduce the \r\nreasons for illegal immigration and lessen the resulting \r\neconomic, social and security repercussions and risks. \r\n In closing, my country confirms the need to \r\nsupport and bolster efforts made by the Office of the \r\nHigh Representative for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States, which aim to mobilize \r\nthe necessary support and help implement the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. This is also considered one of \r\nthe main areas of cooperation among the countries of \r\nthe South because most landlocked countries and \r\ntransit countries are developing countries as well. \r\nBased on this, a successful programme of action will \r\nincrease transactions among the countries of the South \r\nand will achieve the economic integration that serves \r\nthe interests of all. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Peter Maurer, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Swiss Confederation. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland): Geography may be a \r\nchallenge, but it is not destiny. Landlocked developing \r\ncountries (LLDCs) face specific hurdles in their \r\ndevelopment that countries bordering on the sea do not. \r\nBut those hurdles can be addressed, as we are doing \r\nsuccessfully with the Almaty Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action. The Declaration and the \r\nProgramme have contributed significantly to putting \r\nthe special needs of LLDCs on the political agenda. \r\nThis midterm review provides us with a welcome \r\nopportunity to take stock of the progress made, to \r\nanalyse existing gaps and to identify the action needed \r\nto fill these gaps. The excellent report prepared by the \r\nSecretary-General and his collaborators provides a \r\nnumber of insights worthy of our attention. \r\n Allow me to focus on just a few of them. First, in \r\nAlmaty we underestimated the spill-over effects \r\nproduced by the spectacular growth of emerging \r\neconomic powerhouses. Their markets provide at least \r\nsome landlocked countries with a regional alternative \r\nor complement to overseas markets. The negative \r\neffects of high transportation costs and dependence on \r\na functioning transit corridor can be significantly \r\nreduced when these strong performers are in the \r\nimmediate neighbourhood of LLDCs. The increasing \r\nsophistication of these emerging economies should also \r\ncontribute, in the medium term, to nurture the \r\ndiversification of the export structure of countries in \r\nthe region and hence, to reduce the dependence of \r\nmany LLDCs on highly volatile commodity prices. \r\n Furthermore, it is our hope that the high export \r\nearnings of emerging markets will provide the LLDCs \r\nwith additional investment capital, thus facilitating the \r\nregional integration also at the level of capital markets. \r\nThe special needs of landlocked developing countries \r\nand the further strengthening of South-South trade are \r\nissues that need to be tackled in parallel. While \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 6 \r\n \r\ncontinuous support by all development partners to \r\nLLDCs is crucial, strong leadership by the emerging \r\neconomies willing and ready to shoulder their part of \r\nthe responsibility for international economic stability \r\nand prosperity is also called for. \r\n Secondly, we have to re-emphasize the \r\nimportance of freedom of transit. In the context of the \r\nongoing negotiations at the World Trade Organization \r\n(WTO) on trade facilitation, Switzerland and a number \r\nof LLDCs have jointly submitted a textual proposal on \r\nthe clarification and improvement of Article V of the \r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The proposal \r\nnot only seeks to strengthen freedom of transit and to \r\ncreate discipline with regard to transit fees and \r\ncharges, but also attempts to curb the discriminating \r\neffects that regional or bilateral transit agreements may \r\nhave on transit, including by tackling quota systems. \r\nAmbitious wording on transit in a future WTO \r\nagreement on trade facilitation is not enough in and of \r\nitself, but it sets the stage for a much larger host of \r\nconcrete trade facilitation measures all along the \r\nsupply chains so as to truly establish viable, \r\npredictable and reasonably economical transit routes. \r\n Thirdly, the Almaty Programme of Action has \r\nhelped to coalesce a wide range of countries facing \r\nsimilar concerns under one heading — the landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries. At the same time, transit \r\ncountries and development partners have joined the \r\nprocess in the spirit of partnership. Yet, while the \r\nProgramme has been firmly established and \r\nrecognized, further progress is needed. The priorities \r\nand needs of landlocked developing countries have \r\nbecome further differentiated. Their starting points, \r\ncomparative advantages, economic policies and \r\ntransport infrastructures are developing over time in \r\nresponse to both world market and stronger regional \r\nintegration.  \r\n It is therefore important that international \r\norganizations, such as the World Bank and the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, \r\ncontinue to work towards common and reliable \r\nindicators and monitoring. Reliable targets and \r\nindicators help ensure that limited resources are put to \r\nuse where they are most needed in each single case. By \r\nproviding an objective basis of work, they also \r\nfacilitate crucial bilateral and regional cooperation on \r\ntransit and other trade-related facilitation issues. \r\n Geography can indeed be a challenge, but \r\ngeography is no destiny. Switzerland, a landlocked \r\ncountry itself, remains deeply committed to assisting \r\nlandlocked developing countries to better integrate \r\nthemselves into world markets. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nspeaker from Ethiopia. \r\n Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): Allow me to begin by \r\nexpressing our deep appreciation to the President for \r\nhaving organized this important and timely high-level \r\nmeeting as part of the ongoing sixty-third session of \r\nthe United Nations General Assembly, over which he is \r\nalready presiding most efficiently. My delegation \r\nwishes to assure him of its readiness to render its \r\nutmost cooperation to assist him in efficiently carrying \r\nout his responsibilities in this regard, as well as in \r\nothers relating to his high office. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his in-depth and \r\ncomprehensive report on the issues that concern \r\nlandlocked countries. There is no doubt that the report \r\nwill make a significant contribution to these review \r\ndeliberations. \r\n We have carefully noted that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report has captured in detail developments \r\nthat have taken place in landlocked developing \r\ncountries since the launch of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction in 2003. As the report clearly indicates, a \r\nnumber of landlocked countries are giving due \r\nattention to the establishment of fundamental transit \r\npolicies, while also engaging in infrastructure \r\ndevelopment. Although those countries, like all others, \r\nare adversely affected by the toll of rising food and \r\nfuel prices, their economies have also benefited from \r\nthose otherwise negative surges. \r\n The fact that the needs of landlocked countries \r\nare receiving more attention than ever before in many \r\ninternational forums is indeed reassuring. Certainly, \r\ntheir unique situation and their common predicaments \r\nin particular are becoming major items on the agenda \r\nat high-level multilateral trade discussions, such as the \r\ntwelfth United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment held last April in Ghana, and the United \r\nNations panel discussion on the investment needs of \r\nleast-developed landlocked countries, conducted here \r\nin New York the day before yesterday. We are indeed \r\nencouraged by those positive trends. \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n7 08-53512 \r\n \r\n However, in spite of those encouraging \r\ndevelopments, landlocked countries continue to face \r\nseveral challenges due to their geographical handicap, \r\nwhich puts serious constraints on their efforts to \r\nachieve poverty reduction goals and improve the \r\nstandard of living of their populations. Thus, much \r\nremains to be done in terms of mobilizing concrete \r\nsupport to help better address the economic \r\npredicaments faced by those countries. \r\n As clearly reflected in the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction, the most important measures that should be \r\ntaken to mitigate and do away with the difficulties of \r\nlandlocked developing countries are realistic and \r\nsuitable strategies crafted by those countries \r\nthemselves. It is, of course, of equal importance that \r\nthose countries collaborate with their neighbouring \r\ncoastal States to create mutually beneficial and \r\nefficient transit transport, customs and other relevant \r\ninfrastructure systems. Most of those coastal States that \r\nborder landlocked countries are themselves faced with \r\na lack of efficient infrastructure systems and do not \r\nenjoy optimal regional economic integration. \r\n Due to the geographical distances involved and \r\ncostly and cumbersome transit systems, landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries require special market access to \r\nleverage their less competitive position in the \r\ninternational market. They need financial and technical \r\nassistance in their endeavours to build and overhaul \r\nmajor infrastructure systems, including, among others, \r\nrailways, highways and dry ports. They need technical \r\nassistance in modernizing transit customs procedures. \r\n Landlocked countries should be able to benefit \r\nfrom all the support they need to overcome their \r\nsupply-side trade constraints. It is high time that we \r\ncreated the conditions to enable smooth and \r\nharmonious interplay between the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action and the World Trade Organization (WTO) \r\nAid for Trade Initiative so as to meaningfully support \r\nthe capacity of landlocked countries, most of which fall \r\nunder the category of least-developed countries and \r\nsuffer huge supply-side constraints. \r\n Landlocked countries must continue to advocate \r\nfor international laws and conventions to ascertain \r\ntheir rights to uninterrupted freedom of transit. They \r\nshould strive to see improved international legal \r\ninstruments, such as the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea and WTO General Agreement on \r\nTariffs and Trade instruments, particularly regarding \r\nthe relationship of landlocked countries vis-à-vis their \r\ncoastal neighbours. To that end, we should also engage \r\nin a concerted effort with other groupings, such as the \r\nGroup of 77, to which most of us belong. \r\n In order to better coordinate our efforts and avoid \r\nunnecessary duplication, we should also liaise \r\neffectively with our respective regional groupings in \r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America so as to solicit their \r\nvaluable contributions in that important endeavour. \r\nMoreover, such collaboration could help avoid possible \r\nconfusion with other, similar needs of those groupings. \r\n Ethiopia, for its part, has ventured to take a \r\nnumber of steps aimed at ensuring its competitive and \r\ncomparative advantages in the realm of international \r\ntrade. With a combination of an agriculture-led, export-\r\noriented strategy and an emphasis on the development \r\nof key infrastructure systems that are essential to bring \r\nabout rapid growth, the country is making promising \r\nstrides on both fronts. It is also focusing on achieving \r\nbetter export earnings and minimizing the difficulties \r\nposed by geographic barriers through an emphasis on \r\nnon-traditional export items, such as flowers, which \r\ncan easily be transported by air.  \r\n Thanks to the diversification of its export \r\nproduce, inter alia, Ethiopia has been able to register \r\ndouble-digit growth in its gross domestic product over \r\nthe past four years. That demonstrates Ethiopia’s \r\ncommitment to adhering to the ethos and principles of \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n The establishment of a new dry-port services \r\nenterprise earlier this year, the expansion of road \r\nnetworks within and along major transit corridors, the \r\nimprovement of the existing old railroad system while \r\nalso investing in the construction of a new one, and the \r\noverhauling of the country’s telecommunications and \r\nenergy sectors are among the major programmes in the \r\noverall national endeavour. \r\n As we pointed out at the panel discussion on \r\nattracting foreign direct investment to landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, held here at United Nations the \r\nday before yesterday, it is important to reiterate today \r\nthat the Government of Ethiopia raised and allocated \r\nits own resources to finance most of the start-up costs \r\nof all of those large-scale projects. However, in the \r\nspirit of the Almaty Programme of Action, we expect to \r\nreceive timely and adequate financial and technical \r\nassistance from our development partners so as to \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 8 \r\n \r\nincrease our resources for completing those important \r\nprojects. \r\n We firmly believe that this midterm review of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action should take proper stock \r\nof lessons learned in the past with a view to further \r\ngalvanizing existing global partnerships that are geared \r\nto assisting landlocked countries in the light of their \r\nparticular situations. \r\n In that respect, it is worth noting that the outcome \r\nof the Africa regional meeting on the review of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action, which took place in \r\nmid-June 2008 in Addis Ababa under the auspices of \r\nthe Office of the High Representative for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States and the \r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Africa \r\nreflected the fact that, among other things, in order for \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action to be more concrete \r\nin implementation, concerned bodies such as the Office \r\nof the High Representative and regional financial \r\nmechanisms should take the lead in advocating and \r\ncontributing to the investment of new resources that \r\nare essential to addressing the needs of landlocked \r\ncountries.  \r\n The regional meeting also underlined the \r\nimportance of coordinating our efforts with the group \r\nof least developed countries, our World Trade \r\nOrganization negotiators in Geneva, and particularly \r\nsuch regional groupings as the Africa Group, in order \r\nto avoid the unproductive duplication of efforts and, at \r\nthe same time, strike the right balance in advocating \r\nfor our common interests. \r\n Mr. Abani (Niger), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n Finally, my delegation wishes to seize this \r\nopportunity to reassure the Assembly that Ethiopia will \r\ndo whatever it can to implement fully and in an \r\nunfettered manner the Almaty Programme of Action, as \r\nwell as the outcome of this important review \r\ndeliberation. Together, we should strive for the \r\nconcrete realization of the many ideals and proposals \r\nput forth since the inception of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action. We must also work in unison to give further \r\nsubstance to some of the positive results that we have \r\nalready brought about. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to Mr. T. Vance McMahan, representative \r\nof the United States of America. \r\n Mr. McMahan (United States of America): The \r\noutcome document of the midterm review and the \r\nSecretary-General’s detailed, comprehensive report on \r\nthe implementation of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction (A/63/165) provide excellent bases for our \r\ndeliberations this week. \r\n We note that the outcome document and the \r\nreport affirm the value of regional and subregional \r\ncooperation and of accession to multilateral \r\nconventions, transport policy reform, and trade \r\nfacilitation measures including,  \r\n“the commercialization and liberalization of \r\ntransport services and efforts to improve \r\ninstitutional, procedural, regulatory and \r\nmanagerial systems and reduce excessive \r\npaperwork and red tape requirements” (A/63/165, \r\npara. 81). \r\nThose reforms are, in our view, essential for effective \r\nparticipation in the world economy and for deriving \r\nfull benefit from international assistance. \r\n In 13 landlocked developing countries today, the \r\nUnited States, through the Millennium Challenge \r\nCorporation (MCC), is providing national development \r\nstrategies with unprecedented levels of assistance, the \r\ntransfer of know-how and technology, and \r\ncollaborative institution-building. Our partnerships are \r\naimed at transformation and at achieving a permanent \r\nboost to rates of economic growth. \r\n The Millennium Challenge Corporation \r\ncurrently has signed large grant agreements — called \r\ncompacts — with 10 landlocked developing countries \r\nfor over $1.9 billion. In Mongolia, the MCC is funding \r\na $188 million project to rebuild and commercialize \r\nthe national railroad system. Another $23-million \r\nproject is aimed at strengthening the legal \r\ninfrastructure for property rights near Mongolia’s \r\nrapidly growing urban centres. In conjunction with the \r\nAsian Development Bank, $25 million will go to \r\nestablishing a vocational training network for over \r\n30 career paths essential to building an urban, \r\nindustrial-based economy. \r\n In Armenia, the MCC is providing $235 million \r\nto increase economic performance in the agriculture \r\nsector through strategic investments in rural roads and \r\nirrigated agriculture. The compact with Armenia will \r\ndirectly benefit approximately 750,000 people, or \r\n75 per cent of the rural population. \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n9 08-53512 \r\n \r\n The MCC is also working with Mali to transform \r\nagricultural production, reducing vulnerability to \r\ndrought and targeting agro-processing and higher-value \r\ncrops. The Government’s $235-million Alatona \r\nIrrigation Project, financed by MCC, will create \r\n16,000 hectares of new irrigation-fed agricultural land. \r\nSuch infrastructure improvement will be accompanied \r\nby programmes to improve land tenure, establish \r\nagricultural credit and lending, and enhance water \r\nmanagement. Another $184 million from the MCC will \r\nbe used to rebuild Mali’s airport in order to expand the \r\ncountry’s access to trade. \r\n The MCC initiative is about helping our \r\ndevelopment partners achieve their national priorities \r\nbased upon common values. MCC programmes are \r\npremised on the expectation that once the foundation \r\nof accountable public management and a regulatory \r\nenvironment that encourages private economic activity \r\nare in place, investment in people and infrastructure \r\nwill have a permanent and transforming impact on \r\neconomic growth. We see it as a partnership in which \r\nlarge-scale external assistance for infrastructure and \r\nambitious projects will succeed because the conditions \r\nfor lasting national development are present. \r\n MCC does not replace our traditional foreign \r\nassistance to landlocked developing countries; rather, it \r\nsupplements it. In 2006, landlocked developing \r\ncountries received a total of $4.3 billion in economic \r\nassistance from the United States, including the MCC \r\ndisbursements. The United States also provides \r\nassistance to landlocked countries for implementing \r\nand strengthening macroeconomic and business and \r\ninvestment reform. In the past year, our teams provided \r\nrecommendations to Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda on \r\nstreamlining business regulation. \r\n In conjunction with the World Bank, the Business \r\nEnvironment Improvement Project launched by the \r\nUnited States Agency for International Development \r\n(USAID) assisted the Kyrgyz Republic with an \r\nambitious programme of administrative change and \r\nregulatory simplification. The result was that the \r\nKyrgyz Republic jumped from 99 to 68 in the World \r\nBank’s Doing Business ranking, landing third among \r\nthe top 10 reformers for 2008. \r\n In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a \r\nUSAID collaborative programme with the Government \r\nestablished one-stop business registration and customs \r\ndocumentation. The time it takes to register a company \r\nfell from over a month to as little as three days, and \r\nwaiting times at the border dropped by 75 per cent. \r\n The United States Overseas Private Investment \r\nCorporation (OPIC) also facilitates investment in \r\nlandlocked developing countries. An initial investment \r\nby OPIC of approximately $15 million has leveraged \r\nanother $90 million in African capital for the \r\nrehabilitation and improvement of the Nacala corridor \r\nin south-eastern Africa. The transaction includes \r\nsignificant port improvements and will contribute to a \r\nseamless multimodal transportation system running \r\nfrom Mozambique into Malawi and Zambia. OPIC also \r\nprovides political risk insurance, as in the example of \r\n$142 million in coverage for the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan \r\npipeline, the second longest in the world. \r\n We recognize the challenges faced by landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries — the high cost of transportation \r\nand of inputs, the corresponding impact on export \r\ncompetitiveness and dependence on regional \r\nneighbours for access to overseas markets. We believe, \r\nhowever, that it is fair to say that the geographic \r\nposition of landlocked developing countries, their \r\ncentrality, can also be an advantage. \r\n A multilateral framework for cooperation in \r\ntransit and trade, infrastructure development and \r\nregional approaches to problem-solving should help \r\nlandlocked developing countries explore possibilities \r\nfor competitive advantage and profitable niche \r\nmarkets. In our view, the Almaty Programme of Action \r\nis an important and necessary initiative for realizing \r\nthe full potential of landlocked developing countries \r\nand achieving and sustaining the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Abdullah Hussain Haroon, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Pakistan. \r\n Mr. Haroon (Pakistan): Pakistan welcomes the \r\nconvening of the high-level meeting on the midterm \r\nreview of the Almaty Programme of Action. We view \r\nthis process and its outcome as an important step \r\ntowards meaningfully addressing the special needs and \r\nconcerns of landlocked developing States. We are \r\nconfident that this timely endeavour will translate into \r\na comprehensive course of correction exercise aimed at \r\nlearning from past experiences with a view to guiding \r\nour future work. \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 10 \r\n \r\n We meet at a difficult time to carry out this \r\nimportant midterm review of the implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action, which addresses the \r\nspecial needs of landlocked developing countries \r\n(LLDCs) within a new global framework for transit \r\ntransport cooperation for landlocked and transit \r\ndeveloping countries. Only recently, we carried out two \r\nother equally important reviews at the United Nations \r\non Africa’s development needs and its achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\nmessage from those high-level engagements was clear. \r\nImplementation is the biggest challenge and lack of \r\nfinances remains the greatest obstacle to realizing the \r\ndevelopment promises and commitments made here. \r\n The unfolding global development emergency \r\nmanifested through the triple crises of food, fuel and \r\nfinance is making the implementation challenge even \r\nmore complex and daunting, not just for the LLDCs, \r\nbut also for their transit neighbours, which are often of \r\nbroadly similar economic structures and faced with \r\nsimilar scarcities of resources. \r\n An effective strategy to improve transit transport \r\nsystems has also become particularly relevant in the \r\nwake of rising commodity and high oil prices. A \r\ncoherent strategy should enable significant economies \r\nof scale by using trade as an instrument for achieving \r\ndevelopment objectives through improved shares for \r\nboth landlocked and transit developing countries in \r\nglobal trade. \r\n Pakistan strongly supports the LLDCs in their \r\nquest for greater and across the board recognition of \r\ntheir special needs, both financial and technical. We \r\nalso remain committed to helping them within our \r\nlimited means to overcome the formidable obstacles \r\nand pursue their development goals. However, the \r\nrequirements of establishing and maintaining efficient \r\ntransit transport systems are of such magnitude that \r\nlandlocked and transit developing countries cannot \r\naccomplish much on their own. A concerted effort is \r\ntherefore required to evolve policies and mechanisms \r\nwhich can generate the financial resources required to \r\ninvest in the transport infrastructure projects. Such \r\ninvestments need increased financial assistance from \r\nthe development partners, donor countries and \r\ninternational financial and development institutions. \r\n Similarly, an early, successful and development-\r\noriented completion of the World Trade Organization \r\nDoha Round of trade negotiations, allowing the \r\nremoval of distortions in the global trading regime and \r\nproviding enhanced market access, particularly to the \r\nLLDCs, has never been more important and urgently \r\nneeded as it is now. The continuing impasse in the \r\nDoha trade negotiations is alarming and a source of \r\nserious concern. \r\n Pakistan, as a transit developing country, actively \r\nparticipates in the process of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction and remains committed to providing easy, \r\nefficient and expeditious transit access to our \r\nlandlocked neighbours — especially Afghanistan — to \r\nhelp them expand their international trade. In fact, \r\npromoting regional connectivity and making Pakistan a \r\nregional transit hub is an integral part and central pillar \r\nof our national vision for the trade and transport \r\nsectors. Pakistan’s location at the crossroads of South, \r\nCentral and West Asia is indeed helpful in that regard. \r\n To that end, as part of our national trade corridor \r\nprogramme, Pakistan is not only improving and \r\nupgrading its existing logistics and transport \r\ninfrastructure, including highways and the railway \r\nsystem, but has also embarked on constructing new \r\nroad networks, seaports, airports and other related \r\nfacilities. Various linkage roads up to Gwadar, a \r\nmodern port in western Pakistan, are also being \r\nconstructed. With the commissioning of the Gwadar \r\nport, Pakistan will be able to provide dedicated, \r\nefficient and cost-effective transit trade and port \r\nfacilities to our landlocked neighbours, including the \r\nlatest facilities for cargo vessels at par with any \r\nmodern port. \r\n On the services sector, the Government of \r\nPakistan is in the process of revamping the entire \r\ncustoms procedure, including the introduction of the \r\nCustoms Reform Project. The national trade corridor \r\nprogramme provides specific targets and timelines for \r\nachievement in all critical areas, including trade \r\nfacilitation. \r\n Before I conclude, let me also avail myself of this \r\nopportunity to thank Mr. Cheick Sidi Diarra, Under-\r\nSecretary-General and High Representative for the \r\nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States, and his \r\nteam for their good work in making our deliberations \r\nproductive and useful. I would also like to thank \r\nAmbassador Yukio Takasu of Japan for successfully \r\nfacilitating the intergovernmental consultations to \r\nfinalize the outcome of the midterm review meeting. \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n11 08-53512 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Zahir Tanin, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): I am pleased to address \r\nthe high-level meeting of the General Assembly \r\ndevoted to the midterm review of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. I would like to convey my \r\nthanks to the President of the General Assembly for his \r\nefforts to ensure the continuing support of the \r\ninternational community to the landlocked countries. I \r\nalso commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nstrong leadership and focus on the implementation of \r\nthe Programme, and express my appreciation to High \r\nRepresentative Cheick Sidi Diarra and his Office for \r\ntheir excellent preparatory work for the meeting. \r\n Since the adoption of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction five years ago, many landlocked and transit \r\ncountries, with the help of their development partners, \r\nhave achieved certain progress towards realizing the \r\naims of that document. However, due to a variety of \r\nimpediments facing the landlocked countries, many of \r\nthem, including Afghanistan, have not yet been able to \r\nfully use trade as an effective instrument to achieve \r\ntheir development goals. \r\n Among the many areas of progress in \r\nAfghanistan, first, the Government of Afghanistan has \r\nexpanded the role of the private sector to invest in \r\ntransport and transit infrastructure. We have \r\nestablished the Afghan National Trade and Transit \r\nFacilitation Committee. In that Committee, public and \r\nprivate representatives deliberate on major trade, \r\ntransit and transport policies and procedures and \r\ntogether decide on relevant courses of action.  \r\n Secondly, it has simplified and standardized the \r\ndocuments and forms used for border transactions. \r\nThirdly, it has taken steps to modernize border \r\ncrossings by automating, purchasing modern \r\nequipment and constructing new facilities.  \r\n Fourthly, in 2007 and 2008, the Government, \r\nwith the assistance of the United Nations Conference \r\non Trade and Development, conducted surveys to \r\nidentify transit challenges at the borders in cross-\r\nborder control zones and adopted procedures to address \r\nthem. \r\n Fifthly, it has begun negotiations with \r\nneighbouring countries to address the shared \r\nchallenges that increase the cost of goods and services \r\nto the detriment of traders and consumers. As a result, \r\nwe resolved our long-standing problem with Pakistan \r\nof the transit and trans-shipment of fresh Afghan \r\nproducts through the Wagah border to India. \r\n In the priority area of infrastructure development \r\nand maintenance of the Almaty Programme of Action, \r\nfirst, Afghanistan is building new roads. In the past \r\nseven years, Afghanistan has repaired or built nearly \r\n7,000 kilometres of existing and new roads, including \r\nthe ring road and secondary roads. By 2010, we hope \r\nto complete the national ring road and connect it to our \r\nneighbours to the North, South, West and East.  \r\n Secondly, Afghanistan is building new railroads. \r\nAs part of a copper mine contract with a Chinese \r\nconsortium, a railway system connecting Central Asia \r\nto South Asia through Afghanistan is planned. \r\nAfghanistan is also working on joining the trans-Asia \r\nrailway. In addition, the seventh Ministerial Meeting \r\non Transport and Communications of the Economic \r\nCooperation Organization confirmed that the Istanbul-\r\nTeheran-Islamabad railway will pass through \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Thirdly, we are improving our air infrastructure. \r\nIn the past few years, three private passenger and two \r\nAfghan air cargo companies have begun operation in \r\nAfghanistan. Also, we have just completed the \r\nconstruction of the new Kabul international terminal \r\nand the upgrading of its runway. We are also \r\nrenovating and upgrading seven airports in other parts \r\nof the country. \r\n Fourthly, we are improving communications, \r\nwhich is the biggest success story of Afghanistan. In \r\n2002, there were an estimated 38,000 landlines. Today, \r\nthere are almost 6 million telephone subscribers in the \r\ncountry, as well as four providers and an investment of \r\nnearly $1 billion dollars. By the end of 2009, we will \r\nhave completed the national fibre-optic line and \r\nconnected it to two neighbouring countries. The \r\nimprovement in communications services will allow \r\nbetter tracking of information of import and transit \r\ncargo and connectivity to the region and the world.  \r\n Fifthly, we are constructing pipelines and \r\ntransferring electric energy. The agreement to transfer \r\nnatural gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan and India \r\nthrough Afghanistan has been finalized. In addition, \r\nlast month, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and \r\nPakistan agreed to establish the secretariat of the \r\nCentral Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission and \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 12 \r\n \r\nTrade Project in Kabul to expedite the transfer of over \r\n1,300 megawatts of electricity from the two Central \r\nAsian countries to Afghanistan and Pakistan. \r\n In the priority area of monitoring and follow-up \r\non agreements, Afghanistan is again joining \r\nconventions, such as the Customs Convention on the \r\nInternational Transport of Goods under Cover of TIR \r\nCarnets, to meet standards and accomplish the reform \r\nof the transit and freight sectors, as well as following \r\nup on Afghanistan’s membership of the International \r\nFederation of Freight Forwarders Associations. \r\n Despite those areas of progress, Afghanistan has \r\nbeen facing many challenges in meeting the objectives \r\nof the Almaty Programme of Action, notably with the \r\nmuch-needed support of the international and regional \r\ncommunities. \r\n First, while we appreciate the financial support of \r\nthe international community towards improving our \r\ntransport and transit infrastructure, a significant portion \r\nof the donor pledges has still not been delivered. \r\nFurthermore, much of that aid is being delivered \r\nwithout full regard for the goals of the Afghan \r\nGovernment and the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\nTherefore, we urge the international community to \r\nincrease its assistance to Afghanistan in the following \r\npriority areas of the Almaty Programme of Action: to \r\nhelp extend our roads to complete the missing links of \r\nthe regional network; to further upgrade our roads and \r\nimprove maintenance capabilities; to improve our \r\nexisting ports and establish new dry ports; to build a \r\nrailway system; and to modernize our airports. \r\n Secondly, Afghanistan has concluded a \r\nsignificant number of bilateral and trilateral \r\nagreements with most of our neighbours since 2002. \r\nAfghanistan has joined most major regional \r\norganizations and will continue to work towards \r\nmeeting the objectives of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction on regional cooperation. Unfortunately, only a \r\nfew of those treaties have been implemented, owing to \r\nlack of political confidence among countries in the \r\nregion or lack of capacity and infrastructure. In short, \r\nwe have yet to reap the benefit of those agreements. \r\n To move forward, Afghanistan recommends \r\nrenewed attention to international and regional \r\npartnerships. The Almaty Programme of Action can be \r\nimplemented only through those partnerships. That \r\nspirit is clearly highlighted in the Almaty Declaration. \r\nThe Almaty Programme of Action calls on bilateral and \r\nmultilateral donors alike to increase financial and \r\ntechnical assistance to landlocked developing \r\ncountries, particularly those emerging from conflicts. It \r\nalso contains comprehensive directions for donors and \r\nthe international community to assist landlocked and \r\ntransit countries. Moreover, the Programme encourages \r\ndeveloping and developed countries to enhance \r\ncooperation on the basis of mutual interest. Any \r\nimprovement in trade with Afghanistan promises great \r\nbenefits to partnering countries as well. \r\n Regional economic cooperation is becoming an \r\nintegral part of the globalization strategies of almost all \r\nneighbouring countries of Afghanistan. As a result, \r\nAfghanistan now has a unique opportunity to realize its \r\npotential as a land bridge between Central Asia, South \r\nAsia and the West Asian region. We are aware of our \r\nresponsibilities to work with our neighbours towards \r\npolicies and institutional mechanisms to translate that \r\npotential into concrete regional projects, but we would \r\nlike to encourage others to work with us at a similar \r\npace and in the same spirit. \r\n My delegation carefully reviewed the draft \r\noutcome document of the midterm review of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action (A/63/L.3), which \r\ncontains important recommendations and strongly \r\nappeals to the international community and donors to \r\nincrease their level of support, particularly official \r\ndevelopment assistance, to the landlocked and transit \r\ndeveloping countries. It encourages the landlocked and \r\ndeveloping transit countries to take a proactive \r\napproach towards bilateral and multilateral \r\ncooperation. If the recommendations remain only \r\nwords on paper, we may not witness a qualitative \r\nchange; but if undertaken in an honest, serious, \r\neffective and constructive manner, those \r\nrecommendations can improve the nature of trade and \r\ntransit and fully realize the objectives of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Hjalmar \r\nHannesson, chairman of the delegation of the Republic \r\nof Iceland. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): We welcome the \r\nefforts made by the Secretary-General to ensure \r\neffective preparation for the midterm review of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action, and thank him for his \r\ncomprehensive report (A/63/165) on the \r\nimplementation of the Programme. I would also like \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n13 08-53512 \r\n \r\nthank Ambassador Takasu, Permanent Representative \r\nof Japan, for his excellent work in facilitating the \r\nconsultations on the declaration (A/63/L.3) to be \r\nadopted at the end of this meeting. \r\n There have been a number of positive \r\ndevelopments in the landlocked developing countries \r\n(LLDCs) in recent years, and fairly consistent \r\neconomic growth. However, the report of the \r\nSecretary-General shows that considerable efforts are \r\nneeded in the nearest future to improve the \r\ncompetitiveness of the LLDCs in order to strengthen \r\ntheir participation in the global economy. We are fully \r\ncommitted to the implementation of the five priorities \r\nof the Almaty Programme of Action. We recognize that \r\nthe specific situations of those countries, with their \r\nlack of access to the sea and distances from world \r\nmarkets, make eradication of poverty even more \r\nchallenging. Last year, 41 per cent of our bilateral \r\ndevelopment assistance was directed to LLDCs in \r\nAfrica and another 30 per cent to important transit \r\ndeveloping countries in Africa. We are concerned that \r\nthe LLDCs continue to build an unsuitable level of \r\nexternal debt. Iceland is a supporter and financier of \r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, as \r\nwell as the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, both of \r\nwhich have been important for many of the LLDCs. \r\n More is needed on financing for development. \r\nThe forthcoming meeting in Doha on financing for \r\ndevelopment will test the resolve of the international \r\ncommunity, and Iceland, for its part, aims to be among \r\nthe top official development assistance contributors, \r\nhaving already doubled its budget for development \r\ncooperation in the past four years. We will continue to \r\ndirect most of our bilateral development assistance to \r\nthe LDCs in Africa, many of which are either \r\nlandlocked or important transit countries. \r\n Women play a fundamental role in development, \r\nand experience has shown that support for the \r\neducation, health and economic activities of women \r\nhas a multiplier effect for their communities. For that \r\nreason, we have increasingly directed our development \r\ncooperation towards gender specific projects. That has \r\nbeen done through our bilateral programmes in the \r\npartner countries and through support to the work of \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the United \r\nNations Development Fund for Women. \r\n Aid for trade, which Iceland supports, is an \r\nimportant initiative that can reduce the adverse effect \r\nof the LLDC’s geographic location and should be part \r\nof a broader development policy for the LLDCs. We \r\nwill continue to advocate the increased liberalization of \r\ninternational trade. The setback of the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round could slow down the integration \r\nof the LLDCs into the world economy. That makes it \r\neven more urgent than ever that we facilitate market \r\naccess for goods originating in those countries and \r\nensure, at all levels, a broad range of trade facilitation \r\nmeasures. It is our duty to do what we can to offset the \r\nhigh transit and transport costs facing businesses in the \r\nLLDCs. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Don Pramudwinai, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the Kingdom of \r\nThailand. \r\n Mr. Pramudwinai (Thailand): This year marks \r\ntwo important midpoints, one relates to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the other to the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action. Last week, during the \r\ngeneral debate and during the high-level meeting on \r\nthe MDGs, one of the issues often mentioned was \r\npoverty eradication. That issue is clearly very \r\nimportant and the United Nations dedicated one round-\r\ntable meeting on that particular issue during the high-\r\nlevel meeting on the MDGs. \r\n A number of perspectives to overcome poverty \r\nand hunger were raised during such meetings and one \r\namong many is opportunity, that is, the opportunity to \r\nconnect to the world and the opportunity to play a role \r\nin the global community. It is clear that being provided \r\nwith opportunity would help developing countries that \r\nare not yet on track to achieve the MDGs to be able to \r\neradicate poverty, ensure better livelihoods and thus \r\nachieve the MDGs by the target year of 2015. In that \r\nregard, the global partnership for development has \r\nbeen highlighted as a mechanism to provide such \r\nopportunity. \r\n Besides Africa, whose development needs were at \r\nthe centre of the discussions over the past few weeks, \r\nthere are also the special needs of the landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, which deserve unabated attention \r\nfrom the international community to ensure the \r\nrealization of their opportunity and potential. As a \r\nneighbour of a landlocked developing country, we are \r\nwell aware of the role that a transit country should \r\nplay. Thus, we appreciate the efforts made by the \r\nSecretary-General to organize this high-level meeting \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 14 \r\n \r\nto review the progress at the midpoint of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action, which, indeed, highlights the \r\nkey role of partnership between landlocked and transit \r\ndeveloping countries and other partners in creating \r\nopportunity and access to global markets and \r\nconnectivity. \r\n Thailand believes that opportunity is important \r\nfor ensuring development and prosperity. Thus, \r\nThailand has extended cooperation on transport \r\nlinkages to its neighbouring countries through regional, \r\nsubregional and bilateral cooperation, in line with the \r\npriorities set out in the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n To facilitate transit transport and eliminate  \r\nnon-physical barriers we have provided special \r\nprivileges to neighbouring countries by exempting \r\ncustoms on commercial goods that are transited \r\nthrough Thailand. Under the umbrella of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nmember States have also worked on a number of \r\nagreements on transportation and communication, for \r\nexample, the Framework Agreement on the Facilitation \r\nof Goods in Transit, signed in 1998, and the \r\nFramework Agreement on Multimodal Transport in \r\n2005. \r\n On infrastructure, Thailand has placed great \r\nimportance on the construction of transport links \r\nwithin the region under several regional and \r\nsubregional cooperation agreements. The network of \r\ntransportation linkages will facilitate further regional \r\nintegration in economic and social areas, which will \r\nultimately nurture the greater sense of community \r\namong countries. At present, the Asian Highway \r\nNetwork has made great progress with the development \r\nof the East-West, North-South and Southern Economic \r\nCorridors under the Greater Mekong Subregion \r\nframework. Once realized, the Singapore-Kunming \r\nRail Link under the ASEAN Mekong Basin \r\nDevelopment Cooperation will link ASEAN members \r\nwith China. Under the Bay of Bengal Initiative for \r\nMulti-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, a \r\nstudy on the development of transport infrastructure \r\nand logistics between South and Southeast Asia was \r\nconducted by the Asian Development Bank to facilitate \r\ntrade and transport across the Bay of Bengal. \r\n During the third Greater Mekong Subregion \r\nSummit in Laos, the Thai Prime Minister proposed \r\ninitiatives for tourism loops in order to boost economic \r\nactivity through tourism by connecting historical and \r\ncultural heritage sites in the cities along the existing \r\ncorridors in the Mekong subregion. This route can \r\ncomplement existing tourist destinations in the ASEAN \r\nregion and those of the Indonesia, Malaysia and \r\nThailand Growth Triangle. \r\n As the economic corridors under the Greater \r\nMekong Subregion are due for completion in 2015, \r\nThailand is of the view that it would be useful for the \r\nrelevant member countries of subregional cooperation \r\nframeworks, such as the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-\r\nMekong Economic Cooperation Strategy, Greater \r\nMekong Subregion, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for \r\nMulti-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation \r\nand Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand Growth \r\nTriangle, together with their development partners, to \r\nconsider cooperation to identify and expedite missing-\r\nlink projects that would complete or significantly \r\nenhance transportation networks, not only within the \r\nGreater Mekong Subregion but beyond, including \r\nSouth Asia and the whole of continental Southeast \r\nAsia. \r\n On the bilateral basis, Thailand has been \r\nproviding financial assistance to the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, our landlocked neighbour, as \r\nwell as to Cambodia and Myanmar in projects that will \r\nhelp strengthen transport connectivity. However, I will \r\nconfine myself in the role of Thailand as a transit \r\ncountry. Thailand has provided financial assistance, \r\nboth grants and soft loans, to Laos for the construction \r\nof transport infrastructure. On road developments, our \r\nassistance has been provided for building a road \r\nlinking Huay Sai-Loung Num Tha in Laos, which is a \r\npart of route No. 3 of the North-South Economic \r\nCorridor under the Great Mekong Subregion \r\nframework. Currently, we are considering assistance to \r\nrehabilitate route No. 11 in Vientiane. On the \r\ndevelopment of Mekong bridges, Thailand worked with \r\nLaos in utilizing the loan from the Japan Bank for \r\nInternational Cooperation to construct the second \r\nMekong bridge. Thailand has also provided financial \r\nassistance to build the third Mekong bridge and is \r\ncooperating with China to build the fourth Mekong \r\nbridge. \r\n Apart from the progress made in road and bridge \r\ndevelopment, Thailand continues to play an active role \r\nin strengthening other modes of connectivity with \r\nLaos. We contributed financial resources and expertise \r\nto support the development of a rail link from Nong \r\nKai to Tha Na Lang, which was completed in April \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n15 08-53512 \r\n \r\n2007. Moreover, we have offered a soft loan for the \r\nproject to improve the Pakse airport. In addition, both \r\nsides are working on an assessment on the \r\nrehabilitation of Savannakhet airport, which is a part of \r\nthe Asian Development Bank’s East-West Economic \r\nCorridors project under the Greater Mekong Subregion \r\nFramework. \r\n Providing opportunity in term of linkages will \r\ncreate direct people-to-people contacts, which would \r\nhelp people to have better accesses in the economic \r\nand social spheres and improve their livelihoods as a \r\nwhole. In addition, those linkages could have a role in \r\nbridging the development gap through accessibility to \r\nglobal markets. That would enable landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries to gain more economic benefits \r\nfrom globalization, reduce poverty and achieve the \r\nMDGs. \r\n On our part, Thailand will continue to actively \r\nsupport the development of transport links to improve \r\nthe living standards of the people in the Mekong \r\nsubregion. In the Asia-Pacific region, Thailand \r\nappreciates the efforts by the United Nations Economic \r\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, which \r\nis the regional arm of the Organization, in connecting \r\nour members in the region and creating opportunities \r\nto make it possible to have greater access to markets.  \r\n However, there is more to be done. Thailand also \r\nwishes to urge other development partners to \r\nparticipate in transport connectivity development, in \r\nterms of both technical and financial assistance relating \r\nto infrastructure development. Several programmes and \r\nprojects still need more funding support. Moreover, \r\nthere are imperative needs to strengthen administration, \r\nmanagement and the sustainable use of infrastructure \r\nwhile taking into account cost reductions, operation \r\nand maintenance, safety, the mitigation of social and \r\nenvironmental impacts and the fair distribution of \r\nbenefits to the people. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Steve Dick \r\nTennyson Matenje, chairman of the delegation of \r\nMalawi. \r\n Mr. Matenje (Malawi): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating the President for convening this \r\nimportant meeting on the midterm review of the \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action \r\nfor Landlocked Developing Countries. I would also \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/63/165) on the progress made, the lessons learned \r\nand the constraints encountered in the implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action. Allow me also to thank \r\nAmbassador Yukio Takasu of Japan for his facilitation \r\nin the drafting of the outcome document for this \r\nmeeting, as well as the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States for the role it continues to play in \r\nthe implementation of the Programme of Action. \r\n Malawi is both landlocked and least developed. \r\nClearly, like other countries in a similar situation, it \r\nfaces unique and daunting challenges. Those include \r\nrising oil costs, lack of direct access to the sea and \r\nremoteness from major international markets, all of \r\nwhich result in prohibitive transport costs and \r\nformidable obstacles to Malawi’s import and export \r\ntrade. Unless those challenges are addressed urgently, \r\nlandlocked developing countries, including Malawi, \r\nwill remain uncompetitive in the global economy and \r\nthe development gap between them and the rest of the \r\nworld will continue to widen, resulting in their \r\nperpetual dependence on foreign aid. \r\n As Malawi’s President Dr. Bingu Wa Mutharika \r\noften says, a good friend is the one you walk with and \r\nnot the one you carry on your shoulders — because \r\nwhen you trip, you both fall. Accordingly, we urge our \r\ndevelopment partners, as good friends, to walk with us \r\nand not to carry us on their shoulders on our journey to \r\neconomic prosperity and independence. We ask them to \r\ndo so by assisting us to remove obstacles to our import \r\nand export trade so that we can create the needed \r\nwealth we so much need to reduce poverty in our \r\ncountry. \r\n It was precisely for that reason that, in 2003, the \r\nUnited Nations adopted the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction as a reflection of the commitment of the \r\ninternational community to address the special needs \r\nand problems of landlocked developing countries, as \r\ncalled for in the United Nations Millennium \r\nDeclaration. The objective of the Programme of Action \r\nwas to establish a new global framework for transit \r\ntransport cooperation for landlocked developing \r\ncountries. Among other things, the Programme of \r\nAction aims at securing access by landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries to and from the sea by all means \r\nand at reducing costs associated with their import and \r\nexport trade. A critical aspect in achieving those \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 16 \r\n \r\nobjectives is the provision of transport infrastructure to \r\nboth landlocked and transit developing countries. \r\n In that regard, Malawi’s growth and development \r\nstrategy identifies transport infrastructure development \r\nas one of the Government’s six key priority areas for \r\nachieving economic growth in the medium term. \r\nAccordingly, the Government of Malawi is vigorously \r\npursuing a multimodal inland transport system to \r\nimprove road, rail, air and inland water transportation, \r\nwith a view to facilitating internal trade as well as \r\nimport and export trade. \r\n With regard to inland water transportation, the \r\nGovernments of Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia \r\nhave concluded a memorandum of understanding to \r\ndevelop and implement a waterway project known as \r\nthe Shire-Zambezi Waterway Project, which aims at \r\nconnecting Malawi, Zambia and the hinterland of \r\nMozambique to the sea through the Shire River in \r\nsouthern Malawi and Mozambique and the Zambezi \r\nRiver in Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. \r\n The Shire-Zambezi waterway was used as a \r\ntransport waterway by British explorers and \r\nmissionaries going to Malawi a century and a half ago. \r\nAs recently as the 1970s, it was used for transporting \r\nmolasses from Malawi to the port of Chinde, in \r\nMozambique. The idea is to reopen the waterway in \r\norder to reduce substantially import and export \r\ntransport costs and thereby stimulate economic \r\ndevelopment in the three countries and beyond. The \r\nwaterway is intended to supplement existing transport \r\ncorridors to the ports of Nacala and Beira, in \r\nMozambique, and the port of Dar-es-Salaam, in \r\nTanzania. \r\n The waterway project is in line with the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action, as well as the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, both of which aim to address the special \r\nneeds of landlocked developing countries and least \r\ndeveloped countries such as Malawi. It is also in line \r\nwith the objectives of the New Partnership for  \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), which recognizes \r\ninfrastructure development as one of the major pillars \r\nfor economic growth and poverty reduction in Africa \r\nand for reducing Africa’s economic marginalization. \r\nFurthermore, in addition to NEPAD, the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community and the Common \r\nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa support the \r\nShire-Zambezi Waterway Project as a priority \r\nprogramme that needs to be integrated into the surface \r\ntransport networks in the subregion and the maritime \r\nregime of the Indian Ocean. Accordingly, we urge the \r\ninternational community to support the Shire-Zambezi \r\nwaterway initiative.  \r\n As we take stock of the past five years, we urge \r\nthe United Nations to consider the project as an \r\nexample of the efforts being made to implement the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action and to assist in the \r\nmobilization of financing for its implementation. \r\nIndeed, while Malawi recognizes that national \r\nGovernments have the primary responsibility for their \r\ncountries’ economic and social development, we also \r\nbelieve that the international community must ensure \r\nthe success of excellent initiatives such as the Shire-\r\nZambezi Waterway Project. That project will boost the \r\neconomic advancement of millions of people in our \r\nsubregion, the majority of whom are women, who \r\ndepend wholly on agriculture for their survival. \r\n While Malawi agrees that tangible progress has \r\nbeen made globally in the implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action, landlocked developing \r\ncountries continue to faces challenges. More needs to \r\nbe done, not only to provide transport infrastructure \r\nbut also to help to improve transport networks in \r\nlandlocked developing countries. Accordingly, we \r\nsupport the recommendations made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report contained in document A/63/165. \r\nAmong other things, the report calls on the \r\ninternational community to provide greater market \r\naccess for goods originating in landlocked developing \r\ncountries so as to mitigate the high trade transaction \r\ncosts stemming from their geographical disadvantages, \r\nand to increase technical assistance to landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries to ensure their effective \r\nparticipation in the World Trade Organization’s trade \r\nnegotiations. In that regard, we wish to urge the Office \r\nof the High Representative for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States to take the lead in \r\nensuring the implementation of the Secretary-General’s \r\nrecommendations. \r\n Before I conclude, let me put on record Malawi’s \r\nappreciation for the cooperation it receives from \r\nTanzania, Mozambique and South Africa in placing \r\ntheir seaports at the disposal of Malawi. Malawi is also \r\ngrateful to Zambia and Zimbabwe, themselves \r\nlandlocked developing countries, for facilitating the \r\npassage of Malawi’s imports and exports through their \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n17 08-53512 \r\n \r\nterritories. That cooperation is a manifestation of the \r\npartnerships envisaged by the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction. It must not only be encouraged but also \r\nsupported technically and financially by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Michel Kafando, \r\nchair of the delegation of Burkina Faso. \r\n Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nI should like to express my delegation’s satisfaction at \r\nseeing you, Sir, presiding over this high-level meeting \r\non the midterm review of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction. My delegation would also like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the excellent organization of this \r\ndebate and the interest he has shown in the concerns of \r\nlandlocked developing countries. My delegation also \r\nwelcomes the efforts of Mr. Cheikh Diarra, High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States. We would also like to associate \r\nourselves with the statement to be delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Mali on behalf of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, and the statement delivered at \r\nthe 18th meeting by the Chairman of the Group of 77.  \r\n The year 2008 has produced unprecedented \r\nsocio-economic crises, in particular as regards oil \r\nprices, the spike in the price of food products, the rise \r\nin the cost of energy resources and the disastrous \r\neffects of natural catastrophes. They have shaken the \r\nworld economy, but they have a more serious impact \r\non landlocked developing countries. The total or partial \r\ndeterioration of transport infrastructure and the \r\ngeographical distance from the sea of landlocked \r\ndevelopment countries are responsible for serious \r\ndisruptions in our trade, inter alia, as a result of the \r\nlong time required to transport goods and, above all, \r\nthe prohibitive cost of the transport itself.  \r\n The inherent problems of landlocked developing \r\ncountries are major concerns of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action. I believe that this meeting is an opportunity \r\nfor the international community to carry out a midterm \r\nreview of the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction. We are pleased that the review has benefited \r\nfrom the conclusions of the thematic ministerial \r\nmeetings held in June 2007 at Ouagadougou, on transit \r\ntransport infrastructure development, and in August \r\n2007 at Ulaanbaatar, on international trade and trade \r\nfacilitation. Those two preparatory meetings have \r\nenabled us to evaluate the implementation of the \r\nProgramme’s crucial elements, identify the best steps \r\nto address the consequences of the physical isolation of \r\nlandlocked countries and determine how to improve the \r\ncompetitiveness of their economies.  \r\n My delegation is pleased with the relevance of \r\nthe theme of this meeting, which asks the entire \r\ninternational community to consider its role in the \r\nestablishment of transit transport systems in order to \r\nincrease opportunities for trade between countries in \r\nthe interior and the rest of the world.  \r\n Infrastructure funding is of crucial importance for \r\nthe success of the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\nMobilizing investment in transport and transit requires \r\nthe involvement of the private sector and bilateral and \r\nmultilateral financial partners. A genuine national, \r\nsubregional, regional and international partnership \r\nbased on the specific needs of landlocked countries \r\nshould bring us all together through predictable and \r\nsizeable funding mechanisms to build and rehabilitate \r\ntransport and transit infrastructure and to strengthen \r\ninternational frameworks for the promotion of trade.  \r\n My delegation calls on developed countries, \r\nespecially the members of the Group of Eight, to \r\nbecome genuinely involved in the preparatory process \r\nfor the Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development, which is scheduled to be \r\nheld at Doha from 29 November to 2 December 2008, \r\nin order to carry out an objective review of the \r\ncommitments entered into at Monterrey in 2002.  \r\n Half the landlocked developing countries are in \r\nAfrica, where the level of development of the road \r\nnetwork is the worst in the world — twice as bad as in \r\nLatin America and three times as in Asia. Given that \r\nchallenge, African countries have made an absolute \r\npriority of building road, railway and airport \r\ninfrastructure. The recent thematic ministerial meeting \r\nat Ouagadougou supported and encouraged Africa’s \r\ninfrastructure development strategy and launched an \r\nurgent appeal to public and private investors alike to \r\nfund infrastructure and facilitate trade.  \r\n Trade continues to be among the most important \r\nengines of development in developing countries, \r\nespecially in landlocked countries. My delegation is \r\nconcerned about the recent failures in multilateral trade \r\nnegotiations at the World Trade Organization. The lack \r\nof consensus at that level is a clear illustration of the \r\nmarginalization of poor developing countries in \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 18 \r\n \r\ninternational trade. Burkina Faso calls for a resumption \r\nof those negotiations in a spirit of consensus and \r\ninternational solidarity to establish fair rules and \r\nconditions that favour equitable and profitable trade for \r\nall.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Aldo Mantovani, \r\nthe representative of Italy. \r\n Mr. Mantovani (Italy): Allow me to begin by \r\nendorsing the statement delivered by the representative \r\nof France at the 18th meeting in his country’s capacity \r\nas presidency of the European Union. \r\n Italy wishes to thank landlocked developing \r\ncountries and transit developing countries for preparing \r\nthis midterm review of the implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action, at both the national and \r\nregional levels. We also join other delegations in \r\nexpressing our appreciation to Ambassador Takasu, for \r\nsuccessfully facilitating the negotiations on the draft \r\nfinal document, and Mr. Cheikh Sidi Diarra, Under-\r\nSecretary-General and Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General, for the support his Office provided \r\nto the entire preparation process of the midterm review. \r\n When the Italian Parliament revised the legal \r\nbasis for our development cooperation in 1989, it listed \r\namong its priorities the consolidation of local \r\ndevelopment processes in the world’s poorest countries \r\nand fostering their economic, social and cultural \r\ngrowth. For 20 years, that goal has remained at the \r\nheart of our activities. That is why Italy welcomed and \r\ncontinues to endorse the philosophy that led to the \r\nadoption of the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n Between 2003 and 2008 Italy’s overall \r\ndevelopment aid in favour of landlocked developing \r\ncountries increased by about 70 per cent, for a total of \r\napproximately $250 million. Last year, we also \r\ncontributed $50,000 to the organization of the  \r\ntwo preparatory meetings in Ulaanbaatar and \r\nOuagadougou. \r\n The obstacles that Governments of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries and transit developing countries \r\nmust overcome are related not so much to their \r\ngeographical location as to complex regulatory \r\nprocedures, lack of cooperation in tackling \r\nbureaucratic delays and an underdeveloped logistics \r\nsector. Significant efforts have been made in the past \r\nfive years, thanks to the Almaty framework, but we \r\nstill have a long road ahead of us. \r\n Regional and subregional cooperation is also an \r\nimportant means of implementing the Almaty \r\nProgramme, and the relevant regional and subregional \r\norganizations, especially those conducting operational \r\nactivities on the ground, are important stakeholders. \r\nTheir continued interest and commitment is essential to \r\nachieving concrete progress in the implementation of \r\nthe five priorities laid down at Almaty. \r\n Italy remains as ready as ever to facilitate that \r\nprocess. We reaffirm our commitment to improving the \r\nperformance of our bilateral assistance in that sector. \r\nAt the same time, we are consistently engaged in \r\nimproving the impact of those activities and in \r\nincreasing funding for them. \r\n Allow me to mention two major actions by Italy \r\nto implement the Almaty goals. First, we have made a \r\ntotal contribution of approximately €100 million, \r\nequivalent to $140 million, to the Government of \r\nAfghanistan for the rehabilitation and the partial \r\nreconstruction of the Kabul-Bamyan highway. That \r\ninitiative seeks to substantially improve the connection \r\nbetween two major cities, reducing transit costs and \r\ntimes both within Afghanistan and between \r\nAfghanistan and neighbouring countries. The project \r\nwill also help to improve the operational capability of \r\nlocal institutions in charge of monitoring the quality of \r\nthe extra-urban transportation system. \r\n The second action is the rehabilitation of the \r\nToledo-Ancaravi section of the Oruro-Pisiga highway \r\nin Bolivia, which Italy financed through a $25 million \r\nsoft loan. That project constitutes a major expansion of \r\nBolivia’s road infrastructure and will bring much-\r\nneeded economic progress to one of the poorest and \r\nmost sparsely populated areas of the country. \r\n Italy is willing to encourage its multilateral \r\npartners to step up their involvement in this area. \r\nInternational financial institutions in particular have a \r\nreal comparative advantage to provide landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries with the financial assistance \r\nneeded to support their costly investments in \r\ninfrastructure development and maintenance. \r\n The achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals requires resource mobilization and exchanges of \r\nexperiences among all partners, at both the institutional \r\nand private levels. Italy is convinced that the \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n19 08-53512 \r\n \r\ncontribution of the private sector is crucial to the \r\ndevelopment of infrastructure and productive capacity. \r\nIt must be increased through the creation of public-\r\nprivate partnerships. \r\n The incoming Italian presidency of the Group of 8 \r\nwill pay great attention to information and \r\ncommunication technology for development. The \r\ndevelopment of transit transport infrastructure is not \r\nlimited to the construction and maintenance of physical \r\ninfrastructure such as roads, railways, airports, ports, \r\npipelines and so on. Instead, physical infrastructure \r\nneeds to be complemented by an efficient and modern \r\nstorage and transport organization, logistics \r\nmanagement systems and integrated information and \r\ncommunication networks. \r\n Bridging the digital divide, promoting good \r\ngovernance, exchanging experiences and best practices \r\nand proper training and education in landlocked and \r\ntransit developing countries are consistent with \r\npriority 1 of the Almaty Programme of Action. In that \r\nregard, Italy will promote projects fostering the \r\ndissemination of e-government instruments aimed at \r\nimproving and speeding up complicated bureaucratic \r\nprocedures — for instance, in the field of customs and \r\nlogistics. \r\n Italy is keen to discuss with partners the further \r\ndevelopment of those initiatives and the development \r\nof strategies for their implementation that involve the \r\nprivate sector and all major stakeholders. \r\n Italy is ready to do its part to help landlocked and \r\ntransit developing countries. At the same time, we \r\nexpect developing countries to continue to assume \r\nownership and to design appropriate national policies \r\nin the framework of agreed regional initiatives. We are \r\nconfident that, together, we will succeed. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Eshagh Al Habib, \r\nthe representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\nvery outset, please allow me to congratulate the \r\nPresident for convening such a timely meeting. I am \r\nconfident that under his able leadership, the high-level \r\nplenary meeting devoted to the midterm review of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action will achieve a fruitful \r\noutcome. I should also like to thank Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his introductory remarks at the 17th \r\nmeeting. Our thanks and appreciation also go to the \r\nSecretariat for its preparation and provision of a \r\ndocument for this meeting. \r\n Transit and transport issues are of great \r\nimportance, especially in today’s globalized world. It is \r\nbelieved that transit transport development equals \r\neconomic growth, leading to poverty alleviation, which \r\nis the first priority of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). In that regard, the establishment of \r\neffective and efficient transit systems is the top priority \r\nof both landlocked and transit developing countries, \r\nbearing in mind that the primary responsibility for \r\nestablishing effective transit systems rests with \r\nlandlocked and transit developing countries seeking to \r\ncreate conditions in which resources can be generated, \r\nattracted and effectively mobilized to address their \r\ndevelopment challenges. But their endeavours and \r\ncooperation also need to be supported by development \r\npartners and international and regional organizations in \r\na spirit of shared responsibility. \r\n Furthermore, strengthening the legal framework \r\ngoverning transit transport operations — including \r\nthrough the full and effective implementation of \r\nbilateral, subregional and regional agreements — \r\nprepared effective plans to achieve our goals and \r\nexpedite the process. The Almaty Programme of Action \r\ntherefore constitutes a fundamental framework for \r\ngenuine partnership between landlocked and transit \r\ndeveloping countries and their development partners at \r\nthe national, bilateral, subregional, regional and global \r\nlevels. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran has undertaken \r\nmany initiatives, especially in following up and \r\nspeeding up the implementation of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action to facilitate transit transport, in \r\nline with promoting lessons learned from existing \r\nregional infrastructure initiatives to encourage \r\nintegrated cross-border infrastructure investment. This \r\nyear, Iran and the Economic and Social Commission \r\nfor Asia and the Pacific have jointly organized two \r\nworkshops focused on the facilitation of rail and road \r\ntransit transport. Iran is also on the verge of accession \r\nto the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia, \r\nwhich aims to promote and facilitate transit transport in \r\norder to effectively implement trade facilitation \r\nmeasures, including the implementation of regional \r\ncustoms transit schemes.  \r\n With regard to successfully implementing an \r\nautomated system for customs data, Iran is now making \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 20 \r\n \r\nefforts to continue to implement such a system in order \r\nto ease customs formalities. We are also considering \r\nthe possibility of negotiating and granting duty-free \r\nzones and maritime ports.  \r\n In 2008 at Tehran, Iran also held an international \r\ntravel and transit and east-west corridor seminar, at \r\nwhich it introduced to the world the Chabahar free \r\ntrade zone and east-west corridor.  \r\n As one of the most important transit developing \r\ncountries, due to its specific geographical position, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran is host to very important \r\nmultimodal transportation routes whose development \r\nand maintenance pose great challenges. If those \r\nconcerns and challenges are not addressed, they may \r\nhamper cooperation among transit developing countries \r\nand landlocked developing countries. Moreover, the \r\ndevelopment and maintenance of infrastructure require \r\na greater share of the investment and financial \r\nassistance from donors, international financial \r\ninstitutions and development assistance agencies. \r\n I recognize, in conclusion, that addressing the \r\ntransit transport challenges of developing countries \r\nrequires a holistic approach, and I invite all of the \r\nrelevant organizations of the United Nations system — \r\nincluding the regional commissions, the United \r\nNations Development Programme and the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development — and \r\nother international and regional organizations to further \r\nintegrate the Almaty Programme of Action into their \r\nrelevant programmes of work, taking into account this \r\nmidterm review. I encourage them, within their \r\nrespective mandates, to continue their support to the \r\nlandlocked and transit developing countries, inter alia, \r\nthrough well-coordinated and coherent technical \r\nassistance programmes in transit transport and trade \r\nfacilitation. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Viktor I. Zagrekov of the \r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. \r\n Mr. Zagrekov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Globalization is having an ever-greater \r\nimpact on all aspects of world society. However, the \r\ncurrent uneven distribution of its benefits brings with it \r\nthe risk of social and economic upheavals and the \r\ndivision of the world economy into areas of growth and \r\nareas of stagnation. We know that developing and \r\nlandlocked countries are especially vulnerable in such \r\na situation. \r\n In that regard, Russia has taken active steps to \r\nimplement the Almaty Programme of Action, which \r\nwas adopted five years ago and focuses on \r\nimplementing a complex set of measures to develop \r\ntransit shipments. We also fully endorse the \r\ndevelopment of a scheme for a Eurasian transport \r\nsystem on the basis of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction. We believe that that will provide a solid \r\nplatform for dealing with key transport issues in the \r\ncoming decade. \r\n In accordance with the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction, the steps taken by the Russian Federation in \r\nrecent years have focused on improving the national \r\ntransport policy aimed at developing transit shipments, \r\nstrengthening transport infrastructure of international \r\nimportance and activating cooperation with business \r\ngroups through the execution of various projects \r\ninvolving, inter alia, State-private partnerships. \r\n Our key guideline in this effort has been the \r\nFederal Programme on the development of the \r\ntransport system of the Russian Federation and its \r\nsubprogramme on developing the export of transport \r\nservices, which seeks to establish an effective transport \r\ninfrastructure that would increase the competitiveness \r\nof the Russian transport system and realize the \r\ncountry’s transport potential. \r\n The Programme includes measures to prepare and \r\nimplement large complex investment projects aimed at \r\ndeveloping the main freight and passenger transport \r\ncorridors with a view to improving the quality of \r\ntransport services, speeding up deliveries and \r\nimproving the management of transport. The main job \r\nwe face is to enable the containerization of freight and \r\nattract transit flows to international transport corridors \r\nthat pass through the Russian Federation. \r\n Russia’s geographical situation plays an \r\nimportant role in determining our development strategy \r\nand policies. Russia occupies the central portion of the \r\nEurasian Continent and it is our destiny to act as a \r\ngeopolitical bridge between Eastern and Western \r\ncountries. In that connection we participate actively in \r\nthe international dialogue on transport issues as they \r\nare being negotiated both in Europe and in Asia. \r\n We support implementation of the comprehensive \r\nAsian Land Transport Infrastructure Development \r\nProject of the Economic and Social Commission for \r\nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which includes \r\ndevelopment of the Asian highway network and the \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n21 08-53512 \r\n \r\ntrans-Asian railway system. The Russian Federation is \r\na party to the Intergovernmental Agreements worked \r\nout by ESCAP on the Asian road and railway networks, \r\nand we are convinced that their implementation will \r\nlead to significant benefits for developing and \r\nlandlocked countries as well as for developing transit \r\nStates.  \r\n One important element of transport policy that \r\nwill certainly have a significant effect on landlocked \r\ntransit countries in Central Asia is the adoption in \r\nJanuary 2008 of the scheme for a single transport space \r\nwithin the Eurasian Economic Community. The \r\nscheme, in whose preparation Russia played an active \r\nrole, calls for the development of the overall transport \r\ncapacities of all member States, the elimination of \r\nbarriers hampering international shipments, joint \r\nexpansion of the access of the carriers of member \r\nStates to international transport markets and the \r\ndevelopment of transport infrastructure. We have also \r\nundertaken regular demonstration runs of container \r\ntrains linking Europe and Asia. Starting in 2002, such \r\ndemonstration runs have been carried out on various \r\nroutes from eastern ports of Russia, Mongolia, China, \r\nCentral Asian countries and Kazakhstan to the Russian \r\nborders with countries of Eastern and Northern Europe. \r\nThe purpose of those runs has been not only to \r\ndemonstrate the advantages of the land route over the \r\nsea route but also to find bottlenecks so that they can \r\nbe eliminated. \r\n We should also mention a joint ESCAP-\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe project to develop \r\nEurasian transport links, which seeks to identify the \r\nmost important railway, automobile and internal \r\nwatercourse routes linking the countries of Asia and \r\nEurope. The project will determine priority means of \r\nimproving those routes, including measures to \r\neliminate gaps and bottlenecks, simplify border \r\nformalities, eliminate barriers and develop ways to \r\nensure uninterrupted use of those routes for freight \r\ntransport between Europe and Asia. \r\n Significant work has been devoted to the new \r\nEurasian road transport initiative, a project being \r\ncarried out by the International Road Transport Union \r\naimed at providing for regular road shipment between \r\nAsia and Europe. \r\n In conclusion, I want to say that we are very \r\nhappy with the work carried out by countries and \r\ninternational organizations, especially United Nations \r\nagencies, in the framework of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action. We wish again to reconfirm Russia’s \r\ncommitment to the main goal of that programme, \r\nnamely, meeting the needs of landlocked countries \r\nthrough the creation of global frameworks for action to \r\nestablish effective transit shipment systems. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Oumar Daou, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Mali. \r\n Mr. Daou (Mali) (spoke in French): I wish at the \r\noutset to welcome the convening of this important \r\nmeeting. I should like to share the experience of my \r\nown country, Mali, within the framework of the \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n Mali, with seven land borders, is a perfect \r\nexample of a landlocked developing country (LLDC). \r\nOur remoteness from the sea is a serious obstacle to the \r\nprovision of necessary supplies and creates \r\ntransportation costs that diminish the value and thus \r\nthe competitiveness of our export products. Our \r\ngeographical location also explains the vulnerability of \r\nMali’s economy, especially during this time of crisis.  \r\n With reference to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of 23 July 2008 (A/63/165), I wish to focus on \r\nMali’s activities in implementing some of the priorities \r\nmentioned in the report. I turn first to fundamental \r\nissues linked to transit policy; I wish to note that Mali \r\nhas taken a number of substantial measures, including \r\nin improving the effectiveness of transit transport \r\noperations and to reduce transport costs by enhancing \r\nthe storage capacity of warehouses at transit points. \r\n A number of measures have been taken including \r\nthe establishment of the protocol agreement for the \r\nmaritime, road and railroad transport and transit of \r\nMalian merchandise. Mali has also organized the \r\nprivate sector into federations including the \r\nestablishment of the Mali Shippers Council and the \r\nMalian Road Transport Council.  \r\n Turning to the important area of the development \r\nand maintenance of transport and transit infrastructure, \r\nMali has adopted a policy of promoting private \r\ninvestment in the areas of equipment and transport and \r\nstorage facilities. We have carried out transport \r\ninfrastructure work to improve access to all transport \r\nand transit ports. We have also upgraded our rail and \r\nroad transport infrastructure. In order to facilitate \r\ntrade, the self-assessment methodology established by \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 22 \r\n \r\nthe World Bank and the agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem is being used.  \r\n Overall, although relevant actions have been \r\nundertaken, transit transport is still coming up against \r\ncertain hurdles, including the many control points on \r\ninter-State routes and numerous tariff and non-tariff \r\nbarriers. These considerably impede trade and raise \r\noverhead costs for our goods. \r\n Another problem is the lack or insufficiency of \r\ntransit transport infrastructure, which has obliged us to \r\nset up adjacent or joint inspection posts at the borders. \r\nInformation systems are poorly adapted to the \r\nmerchandise, training for those working in the sector is \r\ninadequate, and the storage capacity of Malian \r\nwarehouses at transit ports is low.  \r\n Faced with these numerous challenges and \r\nhurdles on the path of development, Mali has \r\nundertaken, in the context of its statement of overall \r\ntransport policy, a number of actions aimed at \r\nimproving the transport sector, through its Transport \r\nSector Project, including the following.  \r\n Firstly, we have enhanced performance and \r\nmanagement capacities of the sector by reorganizing \r\nand building local capacity, through the \r\naforementioned establishment of the Malian Shippers \r\nCouncil and the Malian Road Transport Council.  \r\n Secondly, we have restructured transport \r\ncompanies and have reviewed the institutional and \r\nregulatory framework in order to further involve the \r\nprivate sector. Finally, we have upgraded and \r\nmaintained our priority transport infrastructure through \r\nestablishment of the National Transport Facilitation \r\nCommittee, the Road Safety Committee and the \r\nAgency for Road Traffic Safety. Additionally, we have \r\ndeclared a National Road Safety Week and have put in \r\nplace the Inter-State Road Transit programme. \r\n Mali remains convinced that the development of \r\nlandlocked developing countries must be based on \r\ncooperation. This is why Mali supports the major \r\nprogrammes for developing transport within the \r\nframework of the West African Economic Monetary \r\nand Economic Union and the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States. The adoption of a programme for \r\nlandlocked countries is an opportunity we must seize in \r\norder to work with our development partners to find \r\nthe financing needed to build and improve the \r\ninfrastructure necessary for the development of our \r\ncountry. \r\n In that connection, I would like to recall the \r\ncommitment of my country to be involved in activities \r\naimed at the implementation of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action. This commitment is demonstrated by our \r\nactive presence in relevant forums and by the \r\nimplementation at the national level of all of the \r\nProgramme’s recommendations. This is why the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mali through his special \r\nenvoy, the Minister of Equipment and Transport, has \r\nconveyed his warm greetings to this Assembly. \r\n Before concluding, I would also like to convey to \r\nthe entire United Nations family our sincere greetings \r\nand thanks. I would be remiss if I did not also greet \r\nand thank the High Representative for the LDCs, \r\nLLDCs and Small Island Developing States for his \r\nremarkable work in coordinating all of these activities \r\nwithin the framework of the current review. \r\n I would also like to thank Mr. Habib Ouane, \r\nDirector of the Division for Africa, LDCs and Special \r\nProgrammes of the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development, for his pertinent analysis and \r\nsuggestions which will be extremely useful for the \r\nrealization of the second phase of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n Finally, I wish to sincerely thank Japan for the \r\ninvaluable role it has played in the negotiations that \r\ntoday have enabled us to make progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Programme. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Maged Abdelaziz, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Egypt.  \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank you the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening this important and timely \r\nmeeting to review the needs and challenges of \r\nlandlocked countries and to express our appreciation to \r\nMr. Cheick Sidi Diarra, Under-Secretary-General and \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Africa and \r\nHigh Representative for the Least Developed Countries \r\n(LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) \r\nand Small Island Developing States, and to his skilled \r\nteam for the excellent work they are doing and for their \r\nefforts in making this review meeting a success. \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n23 08-53512 \r\n \r\n Egypt associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The Almaty Programme of Action represents a \r\nsignificant landmark in the recognition of the special \r\nneeds and problems of LLDCs. The midterm review \r\nprovides an opportunity to assess the progress made so \r\nfar in the implementation of the specific actions \r\naccording to the five priorities agreed upon in the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action. \r\n In this context, I would like to highlight some \r\npoints aimed at enhancing the ability of the landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries to become effective partners in \r\ninternational development activities. Special attention \r\nshould be given to the needs of landlocked developing \r\ncountries in the Doha trade negotiations to enhance \r\ntheir role in international trade system and to push \r\nforward their development efforts. There is also a need \r\nto attract private investment, including foreign direct \r\ninvestment. In that regard, private sector participation, \r\nthrough co-financing, can play a catalytic role. \r\n Egypt welcomes the proposal by His Excellency \r\nthe President of Mongolia to set up in Ulaanbaatar an \r\ninternational think tank to enhance the analytical \r\ncapability of landlocked developing countries needed \r\nto maximize the efficiency of our coordinated efforts \r\nfor the effective implementation of internationally \r\nagreed provisions, particularly the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action and the Millennium Development Goals. In \r\nthis regard, we urge international organizations and \r\ndonor countries to assist in making that initiative a \r\nreality.  \r\n Efforts to facilitate the transfer of technologies \r\nrelated to transit transport systems, including \r\ninformation and communication technology, are also \r\nneeded by landlocked developing countries. We also \r\nencourage the strengthening of South-South \r\ncooperation and trilateral cooperation with the \r\ninvolvement of donors, as well as cooperation among \r\nsubregional and regional organizations in support of \r\nlandlocked and transit developing countries towards \r\nthe full and effective implementation of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n As the current global crises — food, energy, \r\nclimate and finance, and maybe others — will \r\ncompound the challenges to the development \r\nobjectives of LLDCs and will constrain national efforts \r\nto advance implementation of the Programme, a robust \r\nand proactive initiative, including a doubling of efforts \r\nand resources on the part of all development partners in \r\nsupport of LLDCs will be required. \r\n Progressive measures are also needed to address \r\nthe long-standing barriers to development, such as \r\ninternational trade barriers, the lack of resources for \r\ninvesting in infrastructure and weak international \r\nsupport measures. We encourage developed countries \r\nto deliver on their commitments to provide 0.15 per \r\ncent to 0.20 per cent of their gross national income to \r\nofficial development assistance in order to maintain \r\nsufficient levels of assistance to the LLDCs. \r\n Egypt has always been keen to strengthen its \r\nrelations with all developing countries and to establish \r\nrelations on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit \r\nand peaceful coexistence. In that context, Egypt has \r\nestablished two funds as part of Egypt’s foreign policy \r\nmechanism for supporting and strengthening South-\r\nSouth cooperation within its existing resources. The \r\nfunds are the Egyptian Fund for Technical Cooperation \r\nwith Africa, which provides assistance for African \r\ncountries, and the Egyptian Fund for Technical \r\nCooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent \r\nStates, which has been modified to include other \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular LLDCs. We are in \r\nthe process of expanding the funds’ activities within \r\nthose countries. \r\n Egypt accords great attention to the role of the \r\nfunds, providing training courses and expertise \r\ncommensurate with the needs of those countries and \r\nproviding assistance in building capacity and providing \r\nbetter services in the implementation of their national \r\ndevelopment strategies. Trilateral cooperation is an \r\nintegral part of the funds’ activities, together with \r\ncooperation with various United Nations bodies and \r\ndonor countries aimed at enhancing the resources \r\navailable for developing countries and enabling them \r\nto benefit from Egyptian expertise in various areas. \r\nThe funds also provide humanitarian assistance in \r\nresponse to appeals from United Nations bodies. \r\n Several Egyptian companies have taken a leading \r\nrole in directing investments to the infrastructure \r\nsector, particularly telecommunications and \r\nconstruction, in landlocked developing countries, and \r\nwe will enhance that role within the public-private \r\npartnership in the Egyptian system. \r\n Finally, Egypt welcomes the draft declaration \r\n(A/63/L.3) resulting from the midterm review and \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 24 \r\n \r\nwould like to thank Ambassador Takasu of Japan for \r\nhis efforts in that regard. We remain committed to \r\ncontinuing to strengthen and safeguard the interests of \r\nthe developing world — in particular, the interests of \r\nlandlocked developing countries, least developed \r\ncountries, small island developing States and Africa — \r\nin view of the mounting challenges facing developing \r\ncountries. Those challenges require unity and solidarity \r\nthrough the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Armen Martirosyan, \r\nchairman of the delegation of Armenia.  \r\n Mr. Martirosyan (Armenia): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Armenia, I wish to \r\nexpress our sincere appreciation to the organizers of \r\nthis plenary meeting devoted to the midterm review of \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action. I would like to \r\nacknowledge the efforts of Ambassador Takasu, \r\nPermanent Representative of Japan, in facilitating the \r\nnegotiations on the draft outcome document \r\n(A/63/L.3), which concluded last month. \r\n Any programme is only as good as its realization, \r\nand the Almaty Programme of Action is no exception. I \r\nshould like to share with the Assembly Armenia’s \r\nviews on some of the issues related to the Programme \r\nof Action. It is our strong belief that the international \r\ncommunity should adopt effective measures to \r\neliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic \r\nmeasures, particularly against landlocked developing \r\ncountries. Such actions contradict the recognized \r\nprinciples of international law and, in addition to \r\nundermining the multilateral trading system, have a \r\nnegative impact on international and regional economic \r\ncooperation. The interests and concerns of landlocked \r\ncountries should be taken fully into account while \r\nestablishing new transit transport systems, as stipulated \r\nin paragraph 8 of the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\nThe formulation and implementation of any divisive \r\ninitiative would run counter to the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action and would only add to the tension in volatile \r\nregions such as the South Caucasus. \r\n Regional and subregional cooperation play an \r\nimportant role in successfully addressing the specific \r\nproblems of transit transportation. In that context, as \r\nstated in the Almaty Programme of Action,  \r\n “support from all existing sources, where \r\nrequested, for mechanisms of regional and \r\nsubregional dialogue and regional integration \r\namong landlocked and transit countries, is \r\nimportant”. (A/CONF.202/3, annex I, para. 9) \r\nWe also believe that the landlocked countries should be \r\nassisted in the area of trade facilitation and that \r\nrelevant instruments should be adopted within the \r\nframework of the World Trade Organization.  \r\n In order to facilitate the implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action, we would like to make a \r\nnumber of proposals that, we believe, would ensure the \r\neffectiveness of the Programme. We deem it necessary \r\nto take the following actions. \r\n First, we should promote the use and further \r\ndevelopment of existing transport infrastructures in the \r\nlandlocked developing countries, ensuring their \r\nsustainable integration into international transport \r\ncorridors and related regional developments, which in \r\nturn would ensure access to the high seas. Secondly, \r\nwe should thoroughly consider the interests of the \r\nlandlocked countries when formulating development \r\nplans for sea motorways and ports. Thirdly, we should \r\ncreate favourable conditions for the presence of \r\nlandlocked developing countries with regard to ports, \r\nmaritime infrastructures and maritime transport \r\nvehicles. With a view to the implementation of those \r\nproposals, the international financial institutions \r\nshould be urged to provide grants and long-term loans \r\nunder favourable conditions to those interested in \r\npromoting the attainment of those objectives. \r\n The Almaty Programme of Action has \r\ndemonstrated its timeliness and comprehensiveness. \r\nWe believe that, through joint effort, we will produce \r\nnew tangible results to be assessed at the next midterm \r\nreview.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 62/76 of \r\n6 December 2007, I now call on the observer for the \r\nEurasian Development Bank. \r\n Mr. Finogenov (Eurasian Development Bank) \r\n(spoke in Russian): The Eurasian Development Bank is \r\nthe youngest in the family of international development \r\nbanks. The Bank, established in 2006 under an \r\ninitiative of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, is \r\nan international financing institution that promotes the \r\nmarket economies of its members. The Bank also \r\npromotes the economic development of its members \r\nand strengthening their trade and economic links \r\nthrough investment activities. The Eurasian \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n25 08-53512 \r\n \r\nDevelopment Bank is open to new members. We \r\nexpect that Belarus, Armenia and Tajikistan will join us \r\nby the end of the year, and we hope to see our \r\nmembership continue to increase. \r\n From the outset we have placed priority in our \r\ninvestment activities on innovation in transport, \r\ninfrastructure, energy, high technology and other \r\ninnovative fields. The Almaty Programme of Action \r\npays particular attention to these fields, and its aim is \r\nto help landlocked countries, which, in our case, are \r\nKazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and \r\nKyrgyzstan. The Bank is currently considering projects \r\nworth over $5 billion and is contributing more than \r\n$2 billion of their total cost. In the transport \r\ninfrastructure field, we are considering a project to \r\nbuild a waterway connecting the Caspian Sea to the \r\nSea of Azov and the Black Sea, based on initiatives put \r\nforward by the Russian and Kazakh Presidents. The \r\nBank can also contribute to a transport corridor \r\nbetween Western Europe and western China and \r\nbetween the North and South. \r\n We are paying specific attention to projects \r\nlinked to the use of waterways in Central Asia and to \r\nthe exploitation of their hydroelectric potential. The \r\nEurasian Development Bank acknowledges the \r\nimportance of hydroelectric resources and is now \r\ndeveloping its participation in hydroelectric projects in \r\nCentral Asia, which will take into account the balance \r\nof interests of these countries and will give an \r\nadditional push to the integration processes in those \r\ncountries. \r\n The Bank works on the assumption that any \r\nproject in this area needs to be based on consensus \r\namong the countries in the region, bearing in mind the \r\ninterests of the countries that are downstream and \r\nupstream along such transnational rivers. Here, we are \r\nalso using the experience in watercourse management \r\ngained by various countries and the specialized \r\nagencies of the United Nations. Of special importance \r\nin the Bank’s activities is the issue of enhancing \r\npartnership relations with international organizations \r\nand financial institutions. The observer status in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which the Eurasian Development \r\nBank obtained in 2007, gives it new opportunities to \r\npromote multilateral cooperation, to enhance our \r\nparticipation on the international front, and to make \r\ndirect contact with United Nations agencies and \r\nregional commissions. These include the United \r\nNations Development Programme, the Economic and \r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the \r\nEconomic Commission for Europe, the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations and the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development. \r\n The elucidation of mutual interests and the \r\nexpansion of cooperation among countries, \r\ninternational and national organizations and the Bank \r\nare of vital importance. This gives us a better \r\nopportunity to coordinate our activities, to be more \r\neffective in our projects and, at the end of the day, to \r\nimprove the lives of the citizens of our countries. We \r\nare open to working with the United Nations \r\nOrganization and with the international community, as \r\na whole, to strengthen the integration process and to \r\npromote development in the Eurasian area. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 48/5 adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 13 October 1993, I would like to \r\ngive the floor to the representative of the Organization \r\nfor Security and Co-operation in Europe. \r\n Mr. Baltes (Organization for Security and \r\nCo-operation in Europe): On behalf of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization for Security and \r\nCo-operation in Europe (OSCE), I would like to \r\nexpress my gratitude to His Excellency Cheick  \r\nSidi Diarra, Under-Secretary-General and High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, for inviting us to participate in this \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting devoted to the midterm \r\nreview of the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The OSCE is the world’s largest regional security \r\norganization and cooperates with the United Nations \r\nunder Chapter VIII of the Charter. With 56 \r\nparticipating States from Europe, Central Asia and \r\nNorth America, our organization is a primary \r\ninstrument for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis \r\nmanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation. While our \r\nheadquarters with the permanent representations of the \r\nparticipating States and the Secretariat are in Vienna, \r\nAustria, we also work through 19 field presences \r\nthroughout South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the \r\nSouth Caucasus and Central Asia. \r\n The OSCE, using a comprehensive approach, \r\ndeals with three dimensions of security — the politico-\r\nmilitary, the economic and environmental, and the \r\nA/63/PV.19  \r\n \r\n08-53512 26 \r\n \r\nhuman. It therefore addresses a wide range of security-\r\nrelated concerns, including arms control, confidence- \r\nand security-building measures, human rights, national \r\nminorities, democratization, policing strategies, \r\ncounter-terrorism and economic and environmental \r\naspects of security. All 56 participating States enjoy \r\nequal status, and decisions are taken by consensus. \r\n Since 2006, under Belgian chairmanship, the \r\nOSCE has given particular emphasis to the \r\ndevelopment of transit transportation. Its high-level \r\nannual Economic Forum in May 2006 was dedicated to \r\ntransportation in the OSCE area, including secure \r\ntransportation networks and transport development, \r\nwith a view to enhancing regional economic \r\ncooperation and stability. \r\n It became very clear during the Forum process \r\nthat special attention needed to be given to the \r\nchallenges of OSCE landlocked developing countries \r\n(LLDCs) — particularly in Central Asia, the South \r\nCaucasus and adjacent regions. At the concluding \r\nsession, the five Central Asian participating States \r\nissued a joint statement in which they highlighted the \r\nindivisible link between trade and transport and \r\nemphasized that the absence of territorial access to the \r\nsea and high transit costs imposed serious restrictions \r\non their socio-economic development. \r\n Based on the statement and on the \r\nrecommendations of the Forum, the 56 OSCE \r\nparticipating States adopted, at the Ministerial Council \r\nmeeting in Brussels in December 2006, decision \r\nNo. 11/06 on the future transport dialogue in the \r\nOSCE. The decision supports the implementation of \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action and provides our \r\norganization with a strong mandate for continued \r\nactivities in cooperation with the United Nations. \r\n Pursuant to this adoption, my Office, together \r\nwith the United Nations Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and the Small Island \r\nDeveloping States and with the support of the United \r\nNations Economic Commission for Europe, organized \r\na conference on trans-Asian and Eurasian transit \r\ntransport development through Central Asia in \r\nDushanbe, Tajikistan. This conference brought together \r\nministers and senior officials from customs, transport \r\nand trade ministries from LLDCs in Central Asia and \r\nthe South Caucasus, as well as senior representatives \r\nfrom various international organizations, some of \r\nwhom are with us today. \r\n The conference was an important step in raising \r\nawareness and enhancing political dialogue on the \r\ndevelopment of transit transportation in and through \r\nCentral Asia, including Afghanistan and Mongolia, and \r\nin taking stock of the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, thereby \r\nsubstantially contributing to its current midterm \r\nreview. \r\n Following the conference deliberations, a joint \r\nDushanbe statement was agreed upon by the \r\ndelegations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, \r\nAfghanistan and Mongolia. The text of the statement \r\ncovers, inter alia, key issues related to fundamental \r\ntransit transport policies; transport infrastructure \r\ndevelopment and maintenance; trade, transit and \r\ntransport facilitation and public private partnerships. \r\n Finally, and this is an element I would like to \r\nemphasize, the joint Dushanbe statement highlights the \r\nimportance of building partnerships, partnerships not \r\nonly between OSCE LLDCs and their transit \r\nneighbours, but also between landlocked countries and \r\nother members of the international community. When it \r\ncomes to forging these partnerships, the OSCE stands \r\nready to play its role as a catalyst, a platform and a \r\nforum for bringing together various stakeholders. \r\n As a follow-up, this year’s meeting of the OSCE \r\nEconomic and Environmental Forum under Finnish \r\nChairmanship focused on maritime and inland \r\nwaterways cooperation in the OSCE area, in particular \r\non increasing security and protecting the environment. \r\nIn this context, we examined the issue of transit \r\ntransportation and revisited the challenges faced by \r\nLLDCs, thereby building further on the conclusions \r\nand recommendations of previous meetings. \r\n Let me end by assuring you once again of the \r\ncontinued involvement of the OSCE in transport-\r\nrelated activities. In this regard, we will continue to \r\nplay the role of a facilitator and political catalyst, \r\noffering a platform for dialogue and cooperation \r\namong our participating States and all stakeholders \r\nconcerned. Whereas we are not a technical reference \r\norganization, our organization is nonetheless well \r\nplaced to raise political awareness and to foster \r\ntransnational cooperation between countries. Political \r\ndialogue and regional cooperation are the niches where \r\n A/63/PV.19\r\n \r\n27 08-53512 \r\n \r\nthe OSCE can add value to already existing structures, \r\nprocesses and coordination mechanisms. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker at this high-level meeting.  \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.3*, entitled “Outcome document of \r\nthe midterm review of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries within a New Global Framework \r\nfor Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and \r\nTransit Developing Countries”. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/63/L.3*? \r\n Draft resolution A/63/L.3* was adopted \r\n(resolution 63/2). \r\n The President: I am very pleased that we have \r\nconcluded this high-level plenary meeting on the \r\nmidterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action. \r\nAs President, I am particularly gratified that this \r\nreview should have taken place within the General \r\nAssembly framework. \r\n Over the past two days, we have been assessing \r\nthe multifaceted efforts to ensure that landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries have efficient transit transport \r\nsystems to access international markets. We have \r\nadopted the Declaration on the midterm review by \r\nacclamation. It is a balanced and precise document, \r\nwhich provides the guidance that will enhance the rate \r\nof implementation of further projects.  \r\n Our focus on action-oriented programmes that are \r\nboth measurable and feasible has grounded the review \r\nin terms that will benefit landlocked and transit \r\ncountries alike. It also serves to inspire greater donor \r\ninvolvement in the range of needed improvements, \r\nfrom trade assistance policy to infrastructure, from \r\ntechnical and financial assistance to monitoring and \r\nfollow-up. \r\n In particular, the high-level panel on the role of \r\ninternational support for the development of transport \r\nsystems to enhance trade opportunities provided a \r\ndynamic exchange on those complex issues. \r\nStakeholder representatives from landlocked and \r\ntransit countries, donor countries, regional and  \r\ninternational organizations and financial institutions  \r\n \r\nprovided insights into the key partnerships that are \r\nemerging from the Programme of Action. We thank all \r\ndelegations for their valuable input. We now have a \r\nclear assessment of where we stand after five years of \r\nwork. \r\n The United Nations is all about partnerships. I \r\nbelieve that the work orchestrated by the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action is a good example of what we \r\ncan accomplish when we are guided by clear directives \r\nand strong leadership within the context of good-faith \r\ncooperation. Clearly, a key element in the success of \r\nthe review is its emphasis on measurable results and \r\nthe importance of monitoring progress within the five \r\nstated priorities of the Programme. \r\n As the leaders of so many Member States said \r\nduring the general debate in recent weeks, there is \r\nconcern that the current financial crisis threatens to \r\ncripple world trade. A global recession would be \r\ndoubly catastrophic for the least developed countries \r\nthat are not only poor, but geographically isolated as \r\nwell. \r\n I reiterate my concern and my promise that the \r\nGeneral Assembly will use all its authority to ensure \r\nthat the commitments of donor countries to provide \r\nfunding and needed technology transfers are honoured. \r\nI believe there is goodwill, but we must be vigilant as \r\nwe monitor progress in the difficult months and years \r\nahead. \r\n If the United Nations is all about partnerships, \r\nthen let us recognize the central role of solidarity in \r\nassisting each other as partners and as countries. We \r\nface so many obstacles to realizing the shared goal of \r\nending poverty and sharing prosperity among peoples. \r\nThe work outlined in the Almaty review document is \r\nambitious, but inspired by our sense of solidarity with \r\nthe peoples of the landlocked countries and their \r\nneighbours, we can see that the way is clear and the \r\npossibilities endless. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded the \r\nhigh-level meeting devoted to the midterm review of \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action. The Assembly has \r\nalso thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 52. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
