(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Mbuende \r\n(Namibia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 100 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/63/1) \r\n \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): My delegation wishes to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on the work \r\nof the Organization contained in document A/63/1. \r\nDespite the increasing demand on the resources of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Secretary-General has succeeded \r\nin ensuring that the Organization remains relevant and \r\ncommitted to the purposes for which it was created. In \r\nthat regard, my delegation wishes to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General on his tireless efforts. \r\n It is heartening to note that the work of the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies continues \r\nto be acknowledged. Last year, the United Nations \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was \r\njointly awarded the Nobel Prize for its efforts in the \r\nfield of climate change. That honour, the sixth time the \r\nNobel Foundation has awarded the Peace Prize to the \r\nUnited Nations, was recognition of the United Nations \r\ncontribution to the world community. \r\n The United Nations is also recognized for its \r\nhumanitarian assistance. The United Nations has \r\nmanaged to deliver assistance to those most affected by \r\ncalamities through the Central Emergency Response \r\nFund and flash appeals. In all this, for an Organization \r\nsuch as the United Nations, delivery therefore becomes \r\nthe key. Central to the work of the Organization, over \r\nand above whatever else it is seized with, is the impact \r\nof the work undertaken, overseen or executed by the \r\nOrganization on the people who need it most. \r\n In that connection, my delegation welcomes the \r\nintention of the Secretary-General to strengthen the \r\nOrganization’s overall accountability framework — its \r\naccountability within the Organization and the \r\nSecretariat’s accountability to Member States. We also \r\nwelcome the continued periodic briefings by the \r\nSecretary-General to the General Assembly on his most \r\nrecent activities, which we view as one avenue, among \r\nothers, for direct interaction with the Secretary-General \r\nwhile keeping abreast of developments involving the \r\nOrganization. \r\n An Organization that has been around for as long \r\nas the United Nations has cannot but undergo certain \r\nchanges. That process of reform must be undertaken in \r\norder to strengthen the Organization and address its \r\nshortcomings. But change does not come easily to any \r\nentity. Indeed, as the inventor Charles Kettering once \r\nsaid, “The world hates change, yet it is the only thing \r\nthat has brought progress”. \r\n My delegation therefore commends the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s ongoing efforts on management reform. We \r\nagree with the Secretary-General that a results-based \r\nmanagement approach requires managers clearly to \r\nstate their intended target. That will in turn afford the \r\nOrganization the opportunity to formulate a better \r\nstrategic plan that will enable Member States to make \r\nA/63/PV.21  \r\n \r\n08-53989 2 \r\n \r\nbetter informed decisions. However, those management \r\nreforms must be tackled holistically, with full emphasis \r\non, first, a clear understanding of the process, in that it \r\nmust be transparent, inclusive and open-ended; \r\nsecondly, full adherence to the rules and procedures \r\nand the United Nations Charter; and, thirdly, a clear \r\nunderstanding of the priorities we intend to achieve. \r\n On peacekeeping, there has been much discussion \r\non the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations (DPKO), which eventually saw the creation \r\nof a new Department of Field Support, the \r\nestablishment of the Office of the Rule of Law and \r\nSecurity Institutions in the DPKO, integrated \r\noperational teams and a number of new shared \r\nmechanisms. The restructuring was intended to \r\nstreamline peacekeeping activities in order to ensure a \r\nmore effective and efficient delivery, in line with the \r\nincrease in the number of missions and personnel \r\ndeployed in missions throughout the globe. Yet despite \r\nthe restructuring, there have been instances when \r\ntroop-contributing countries have been left out of the \r\nloop in matters of communication and information. We \r\nview that with concern. The DPKO should maintain the \r\nprimacy of disseminating information to troop-\r\ncontributing countries, particularly when the personnel \r\nof these troop-contributing countries are involved on \r\nthe ground. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General that we have \r\nbefore us today starts off with the work of the \r\nOrganization in helping Member States to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. Malaysia \r\ncommends the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in that regard, in particular the recent \r\nconvening of high-level meetings on the MDGs. While \r\nthe high-level meeting itself has resulted in new and \r\nadditional pledges to the tune of $16 billion, we hope \r\nthat the funding and resources to attain the MDGs will \r\nalso be made available in a systematic and predictable \r\nmanner, and not in an ad hoc way, and as a response to \r\nspecific events. Malaysia trusts that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s full report on the pledges will not be long in \r\ncoming. \r\n On the MDGs themselves, we need to understand \r\nthat the Goals represent the barest minimum objective. \r\nThe United Nations should encourage those better-\r\nplaced countries to further achieve the MDG-Plus \r\nobjectives. It is with that end in sight that Malaysia \r\npledges a higher level of cooperation with the United \r\nNations in the area of South-South cooperation. \r\n The achievement of Millennium Development \r\nGoal 6 remains a major question mark for many \r\ncountries of the world, Malaysia included. We note the \r\nmany efforts that have been launched both within and \r\noutside the Organization in recognition of the problem. \r\nDespite it all, the number of people who suffer from \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious \r\ndiseases continues to rise. That merely means that \r\nmore needs to be done, and we hope that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s target of 2010 to ensure universal coverage \r\nagainst malaria will be echoed in the fight to reduce the \r\nspread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious \r\ndiseases. \r\n I would be remiss if I did not address the question \r\nof Palestine. That is an issue that has been on the \r\nagenda of the United Nations for more than 50 years \r\nand remains one of the most vital components of \r\ngeneral peace and security. The Security Council has \r\nadopted important resolutions on that question that \r\nshould have accorded to Palestinians the restoration of \r\ntheir rights. Unfortunately, there has been no follow-up \r\naction to compel Israel to respect international law and \r\nthus end its illegal occupation and illegitimate \r\npractices in the occupied Palestinian territories. Today, \r\nthe violations of the human rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople continue and the daily life of ordinary people in \r\nGaza is made difficult by economic blockades. \r\n Illegal settlements are still on the increase despite \r\nwidespread condemnation. Thus, the Organization has \r\nnot delivered on its potential in that situation, at least \r\nnot to the millions of Palestinian refugees caught in the \r\nconflict or to those whose human rights continue to be \r\nviolated. \r\n My delegation believes in the multilateral, \r\ninclusive nature of the United Nations. With so many \r\nof the world’s peoples looking to the United Nations \r\nfor leadership, coordination and hope, Member States \r\nmust ensure that the Organization is able to deliver on \r\nits promise of a better tomorrow. Deliverables can be \r\nachieved only if there is a strong political will to see \r\nthe matter through. An Organization that can \r\neffectively deliver to the people and uphold its \r\nmandated promise will be a strong, viable and relevant \r\nOrganization, able to respond to the challenges of the \r\nfuture. Malaysia is committed to that vision and \r\n A/63/PV.21\r\n \r\n3 08-53989 \r\n \r\npledges its support for the Secretary-General’s \r\nendeavours in this matter. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the Observer State of the Holy See. \r\n Monsignor Bharanikulangara (Holy See): I \r\nmake this statement on behalf of the Permanent \r\nObserver.  \r\n My delegation thanks the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on the work of the Organization and looks \r\nforward to working with him to help ensure that this \r\ninstitution builds upon its successes and bridges its \r\nshortcomings. We are witnessing intractable conflicts \r\nin many regions of the world. Whether under the guise \r\nof civil turmoil, terrorist activity or international \r\nconflicts, they perpetuate the flawed belief that \r\nviolence and war can replace cooperation and dialogue \r\nfor the common good. In that context, the impasse in \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament, the proliferation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons, and the growing strain \r\non the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons are enduring obstacles and severely hinder \r\nthe promotion of the common good and mutual \r\ncooperation. \r\n However, rather than addressing the symptoms of \r\nhumankind’s failings, we would do well to focus on the \r\nunderlying causes. Some 40 years ago, Pope Paul VI \r\nstated in this Hall that development is the new name \r\nfor peace, and the wisdom of those words should guide \r\nus in crafting adequate solutions. At this point in time, \r\nwe cannot but acknowledge a number of setbacks in \r\nour work to globalize solidarity towards the poor. With \r\nthe failed trade talks in the Doha Round, the increasing \r\ninternational economic slowdown and the missed \r\ndevelopment assistance targets, we have seen the need \r\nfor effective consensus and delivery. The upcoming \r\nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment in Doha presents an opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to consolidate promises and \r\nrenew cooperation between developed and developing \r\ncountries. My delegation looks forward to working \r\nwith the participants in order to put the ingenuity of \r\nglobal economic activity at the service of people rather \r\nthan putting people at its mercy. \r\n The sixty-third session of the General Assembly \r\nstands at a poignant moment in United Nations history. \r\nSixty years ago in December, this body produced the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights by which \r\nworld leaders agreed that human rights are not \r\nbestowed by Governments at their whim, but rather are \r\ninherent in all individuals regardless of race, \r\nnationality or religious belief. It is humbling to recall \r\nthe war that preceded the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, but also empowering to \r\nknow that if the world could come together to ensure \r\nthe rights of all after such a devastating conflict, then \r\nsurely today we can find the political will to guarantee \r\nthe full enjoyment of all human rights. The right to life \r\nand the right to freedom of thought, conscience and \r\nreligion remain the core of the human rights system. \r\nThe discourse over those two fundamental rights is on \r\nthe rise.  \r\n However, too often those rights are neglected in \r\nfavour of more politically expedient issues, and only \r\nwhen the voices of the disenfranchised and \r\ndiscriminated against become too loud to be ignored do \r\nwe give them their proper attention. Only by respecting \r\nthe right to life from the moment of conception until \r\nnatural death, as well as the consciences of all \r\nbelievers, will we promote a world cognizant and \r\nrespectful of a deeper sense of meaning and purpose. A \r\nyear ago, the General Assembly adopted the \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We \r\nencourage the membership to build on that common \r\ncommitment in order to foster greater understanding \r\nbetween Governments and indigenous communities. \r\n Finally, it is my delegation’s hope that this \r\nsession of the General Assembly can serve to promote \r\nrenewed cooperation and harmony among all peoples. \r\nTime and time again we have seen an increase in the \r\nuse of rhetoric that, instead of bringing nations \r\ntogether, chastises and divides them. In all corners of \r\nthe globe, such rhetoric has been used to foment \r\nmistrust between States. However, it is my delegation’s \r\nhope that this session will reverse that crescendo of \r\nsuspicion and mistrust and give way to confidence in \r\nour common leadership and shared values. To that end, \r\nthe fully operational Mediation Support Unit serves as \r\na valuable tool for restoring lost trust, and we look \r\nforward to following its further development. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report recognizes the \r\nneed to address an ever-growing number of issues. Be \r\nit in humanitarian assistance, mediation or the ability \r\nto bring parties together, this Organization must \r\ncontinue to be shaped in a way that is more responsive \r\nto the needs of the twenty-first century. \r\nA/63/PV.21  \r\n \r\n08-53989 4 \r\n \r\n Mr. Heidt (United States of America): I should \r\nlike to briefly address the portions of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report dealing with the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The United States is \r\ncommitted to working with its partners to achieve and \r\nsustain the development goals of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. Collectively, the Member States worked \r\ndiligently at the Millennium Summit to arrive at \r\nagreed, time-bound commitments to pursue our shared \r\naspirations for global development.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s report on the work of the \r\nOrganization rightly notes the significant progress we \r\nhave made towards achieving the MDGs, as well as the \r\nimportant challenges that remain. Global rates of \r\nextreme poverty are falling and access to education is \r\nrising impressively. Much still needs to be done to \r\naddress maternal mortality and to reduce the spread of \r\nAIDS, malaria and other major diseases. Additionally, \r\nthe overall pace of development remains troublingly \r\nuneven, particularly in the case of fragile and failed \r\nStates.  \r\n The United States, together with its development \r\npartners, is working hard to meet those challenges. We \r\nparticipated actively in the Secretary-General’s very \r\nsuccessful high-level event two weeks ago and \r\nsponsored a side event focusing on the crucial \r\nimportance of raising agriculture value chain \r\nproductivity as a strategy for combating hunger and \r\npoverty.  \r\n As in previous years, in considering the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, the United States wishes to \r\nexpress its concern about the continued revisions to the \r\nSecretariat’s framework of goals, targets and \r\nindicators, which it presents to the international \r\ncommunity as the time-bound Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We are puzzled as to why the \r\nSecretariat has selectively incorporated as Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals new targets drawn from the World \r\nSummit Outcome Document when that same Document \r\nclearly defines the MDGs as those laid out in the \r\nMillennium Declaration. \r\n The United States remains committed to the \r\nWorld Summit Outcome Document, which presents a \r\ncomprehensive vision of the development process and \r\nthe United Nations role in it. However, we do not \r\naccept the Secretariat’s decision to selectively elevate \r\ncommitments from the World Summit, including one \r\nrelated to universal access to reproductive health, into \r\na special category of commitments worthy to be \r\nregarded as MDGs or as MDG targets or indicators. \r\nFinally, we are troubled by clear changes in wording \r\nbetween intergovernmentally agreed documents and \r\nseveral of the Secretariat’s new MDG targets, which \r\nattempt to expand and redefine the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals without consulting Member States. \r\n As we have noted previously, such expansion and \r\nredefinition threatens to dilute the carefully considered \r\npolitical commitments all of us made at the Millennium \r\nSummit in 2000 and distracts attention from our joint \r\npursuit of the internationally agreed goals. Rather than \r\nexpanding targets, we should be focusing them and \r\nengaging the many sources of financing for \r\ndevelopment, including trade, investment, other capital \r\nflows and domestic resources, both public and private, \r\nto achieve them. Let us remember a key development \r\nprinciple enshrined in the Millennium Development \r\nGoals: It is up to each country to determine its \r\ndevelopment priorities. MDG targets that would dictate \r\nhow a country should develop and that do not \r\nrecognize the critical importance of self-determination \r\nare destined to be ineffective.  \r\n There is no doubt that, despite our best efforts to \r\nmeet our commitments, we have yet to fulfil our \r\ndevelopment aspirations. Many challenges remain, but \r\ncreating new definitions or expanding the scope of \r\npreviously agreed Millennium Development Goals will \r\nnot help us maintain consensus. Let us recognize the \r\nprogress that we have made, take note of the successes \r\nwe have witnessed and the lessons we have learned, \r\nand rededicate ourselves to the ambitious and vital \r\ngoals Member States set in 2000. \r\n Mrs. Asmady (Indonesia): My delegation wishes \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization. We very much value his \r\noverview of the United Nations during the past year. \r\nWe appreciate his highlighting of the critical factors \r\nthat need to be addressed if we are to realize a future \r\nthat is prosperous, stable and secure for all. Clearly, we \r\nare at a crucial juncture. The world faces a series of \r\nparallel crises — financial, food, energy and \r\nenvironment.  \r\n A number of world leaders and the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, speaking recently from this \r\npodium, aptly alluded to the fact that business cannot \r\ngo on as usual in the face of such serious problems. \r\nThe international community needs to come together so \r\n A/63/PV.21\r\n \r\n5 08-53989 \r\n \r\nthat it can tackle the global crises effectively. The \r\nsolution is to be found in working together and making \r\nthe United Nations a strong pivot for achieving an \r\nequitable international socio-economic and political \r\norder. In that respect, we support the focus in the report \r\non three areas — delivering results for the people most \r\nin need, securing global goods, and creating a stronger \r\nUnited Nations through full accountability. \r\n I should like to take a few moments to share our \r\nthoughts on each of the three focus areas. \r\n First, the United Nations Charter vision of \r\nachieving “better standards of life in larger freedom” \r\nremains the paramount unfulfilled agenda. We are past \r\nthe halfway period in the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the results so far \r\nare uneven, to put it mildly. Pockets of poverty still \r\nexist in rural regions of developing countries where \r\nconditions may have become worse due to high food \r\nand energy costs. I will not dwell on the skyrocketing \r\nglobal food prices. Indonesia’s view on that issue has \r\nbeen elaborated on many occasions, including just last \r\nweek. Suffice it to say that a focus on agriculture as a \r\ncore of the national development agenda, along with \r\nmassive investment, especially to help small farmers \r\ngrow and distribute their crops, are vital. \r\n The unfolding financial crisis and the uncertainty \r\nand slowdown of the global economy are other serious \r\nemerging issues. What adds to the anxiety is that no \r\none yet knows what the full implications for the world \r\neconomy will be. It is in times like these that the \r\nUnited Nations system, with the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil at the helm, needs to actively engage with the \r\nBretton Woods institutions and other relevant financial \r\ninstitutions to ascertain the impact of such turbulences. \r\nThe Council must intensify its central role for \r\ncoordinating international economic relations. It should \r\ndraw together timely policy responses and assure their \r\ncoherence with an invigorated result-orientation. But \r\nfor that to happen, the political will of Member States \r\nmust also be present. To effectively address the plight \r\nof those most in need, let us all come forward and \r\nactualize our commitments under the global \r\npartnership for development. It is important that the \r\nmomentum generated by the recent high-level meetings \r\nin New York not be lost. \r\n Secondly, a greater effort should be made to \r\nsecure global goods, especially for those who are \r\nmarginalized. The Secretary-General has appropriately \r\nhighlighted the challenges of climate change, counter-\r\nterrorism, disarmament and non-proliferation, and \r\nglobal health in that context. We must vigorously \r\nconserve our natural resources, especially our carbon \r\nsinks, forests and coral reefs so that we do not deprive \r\nfuture generations of the resources they need for \r\nsurvival. The Bali Road Map has been critical in \r\ngalvanizing the international community on the cause \r\nof climate change.  \r\n I should like to reiterate my Government’s wish \r\nthat “by 2009 we should produce an ambitious \r\npost-2012 global climate regime that will contain \r\nglobal warming to within two degrees Celsius in the \r\nnext 20 years” (A/63/PV.14). We need to intensify \r\ninternational efforts towards a timely fruition that will \r\nstop and reverse the deterioration of our planet.  \r\n On the subject of counter-terrorism, Indonesia \r\nhas been and will continue to be in the vanguard. In \r\nthat regard, we are convinced that the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy will facilitate \r\ninternational efforts. We need to explore every type of \r\ncooperation at different levels and to implement the \r\nStrategy and its Plan of Action to the fullest extent. \r\nWhile the delegation of Indonesia looks forward to a \r\nconsistent, transparent, comprehensive and balanced \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, we also look forward to negotiating \r\na comprehensive and balanced convention that respects \r\nthe principles of international law, humanitarian law, \r\nand the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.  \r\n On disarmament and non-proliferation, we regret to \r\nsay that, despite some earnest efforts by many Member \r\nStates, the disarmament machinery remains mired in \r\ndeadlock on some fundamental and previously agreed \r\npoints of the global disarmament agenda. Today, we are \r\nmore convinced than ever that nuclear disarmament is \r\nimperative for international peace. We are faced with the \r\ndangers of nuclear weapons finding their way into more \r\nmilitary arsenals and the risk that those tools of \r\ndeterrence might become new tools for terrorists, with \r\ndevastating consequences. Non-proliferation is vital but \r\nis not sufficient. Nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear \r\ndisarmament are mutually reinforcing and both must be \r\npursued actively in a balanced and non-discriminatory \r\nmanner. Otherwise we may soon enter a new nuclear \r\narms race with new types, uses and rationales for such \r\nweapons. \r\nA/63/PV.21  \r\n \r\n08-53989 6 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, Indonesia fully supports creating a \r\nstronger United Nations through full accountability. We \r\nagree with the Secretary-General when he states that \r\ngoals will not be reached “unless full accountability \r\nbecomes both our organizing principle and our \r\noperational guideline” (A/63/1, para. 141). In that \r\nregard, we appreciate such steps as the new \r\naccountability compact with senior managers and the \r\nimplementation of results-based management and \r\nenterprise risk management. We commend the \r\nSecretary-General’s effort to strengthen the Secretariat’s \r\naccountability to Member States for ensuring that the \r\nOrganization is well managed and delivering results. It \r\nwould also be appreciated if regular updates could be \r\nprovided to Member States on the progress being made \r\nin that respect. \r\n The United Nations is the best representation of \r\nthe aspirations of the global community, and we must \r\ndo all that is in our power to make the United Nations \r\nmanifest the will of we the peoples. In that regard, it is \r\nimperative that the Security Council, which is \r\nentrusted with the immense responsibility of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, should \r\nalso reflect the views of people everywhere. We are \r\npleased that the democratization of the United Nations \r\nis part of the theme of the present session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and that the President has told us  \r\n \r\nalready about the various initiatives that he will be \r\ntaking to advance democracy at the United Nations. \r\nReform of the Security Council is a must, as is the \r\nstrengthening of the role of the General Assembly as \r\nthe highest deliberative and decision-making organ of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Lastly, I should like to emphasize the role of \r\nregional organizations and how valuable their \r\ncontribution can be in matters of peace and security, as \r\nwe have seen through the United Nations partnerships \r\nwith the African Union and other groupings. The \r\nregional entities are also important for issues of \r\ndevelopment and humanitarian help. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly takes \r\nnote of the report of the Secretary-General on the work \r\nof the Organization, contained in document A/63/1? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 100. \r\nThe meeting rose at 3.45 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
