(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 71 (continued) \r\n \r\nRequest for an advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice on whether the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence of Kosovo is in \r\naccordance with international law \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/63/L.2) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I give the \r\nfloor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.2. \r\n Mr. Jeremić (Serbia): It is my honour and \r\npleasure to introduce the draft resolution proposed by \r\nthe Republic of Serbia contained in document \r\nA/63/L.2. My presence here today as Foreign Minister \r\nof the Republic of Serbia signifies the importance that \r\nmy country assigns to this issue. \r\n On 17 February 2008, the provisional institutions \r\nof self-government of Serbia’s southern province of \r\nKosovo and Metohija unilaterally declared \r\nindependence. Our democracy responded with maximal \r\nrestraint. We ruled out the use of force and the \r\nimposition of economic sanctions against the \r\nbreakaway province. Serbia decided to defend its \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity through diplomacy \r\nand international law. \r\n We have chosen to seek an advisory opinion from \r\nthe International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality \r\nof the unilateral declaration of independence. Today we \r\nare turning to the General Assembly to convey that \r\nrequest to the Court, in fulfilment of its powers and \r\nfunctions under the United Nations Charter. \r\n This non-confrontational approach is highly \r\nprincipled and legitimate. It will serve to reduce \r\ntensions in the region and facilitate our efforts at \r\nreconciliation. \r\n The Republic of Serbia believes that sending this \r\nquestion to the Court would prevent the Kosovo crisis \r\nfrom serving as a deeply problematic precedent in any \r\npart of the globe where secessionist ambitions are \r\nharboured. \r\n We also believe that the Court’s advisory opinion \r\nwould provide politically neutral, yet judicially \r\nauthoritative, guidance to many countries still \r\ndeliberating how to approach unilateral declarations of \r\nindependence in line with international law. \r\n Lastly, we believe that recourse to the Court \r\nwould strengthen the rule of law in international \r\nrelations and make the proposed course of action a \r\nsymbol of the world community’s resolve to take the \r\nUnited Nations Charter as its guide. \r\n Supporting this draft resolution would also serve \r\nto reaffirm a fundamental principle: the right of any \r\nMember State of the United Nations to pose a simple, \r\nbasic question on a matter it considers vitally important \r\nto the Court. To vote against it would be in effect a \r\nvote to deny the right of any country to seek — now or \r\nin the future — judicial recourse through the United \r\nNations system. To vote against it would also mean \r\nA/63/PV.22  \r\n \r\n08-54101 2 \r\n \r\naccepting that nothing can be done when secessionists \r\nin whichever part of the globe assert the uniqueness of \r\ntheir cause and claim exception to the universal scope \r\nof the international legal order. \r\n My country would like to extend our appreciation \r\nto those that, while not currently persuaded of the \r\nutility of the proposal, have decided to engage \r\nthemselves in this question, acknowledging that our \r\ndraft resolution addresses important issues of \r\ninternational law. \r\n All Member States have on numerous occasions \r\nconfirmed their confidence in the Court as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. We must therefore \r\nhave full confidence that the Court will perform its \r\nduty in an exemplary fashion without any special \r\ndirectives. \r\n The question posed is amply clear and refrains \r\nfrom taking political positions on the Kosovo issue. \r\nThe Court’s response, in the form of an advisory \r\nopinion, will be based on international law, in \r\naccordance with the Court’s Statute and Rules of \r\nProcedure. Article 66 of the Statute gives a clear \r\nindication of the procedures utilized by the Court. No \r\nadditional instructions by the General Assembly are \r\nappropriate. \r\n We believe that the draft resolution in its present \r\nform is entirely non-controversial. It represents the \r\nlowest common denominator of the positions of the \r\nMember States on this question, and hence there is no \r\nneed for any changes or additions. Let us adopt it and \r\nallow the Court to act freely and impartially within the \r\nframework of its competencies. We are confident that \r\nthe Court will know what to do, and that it will take \r\ninto account the opinions of all interested Member \r\nStates and international organizations. We hold that the \r\nmost prudent way to proceed today is to adopt our draft \r\nresolution without opposition, in the same way that it \r\nwas decided at the General Committee to include this \r\nitem in the agenda. \r\n The Republic of Serbia’s steadfast pursuit of this \r\npeaceful course of action is a demonstration of our firm \r\ncommitment to the international system that we have \r\nall helped to build. \r\n History has placed the problem of Kosovo’s \r\nunilateral declaration of independence before us all. \r\nThe choice of whether to act through law is upon us. \r\nBy acting concertedly in support of our draft \r\nresolution, we will have come together to help restore \r\nthe sacrosanct character of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the document that binds us to one another as a \r\nworld community of sovereign equals. And, by seizing \r\nthe present moment, we will have begun to further \r\nenhance the enduring benefit and honour of the \r\nfounding principles of the United Nations. \r\n Sir John Sawers (United Kingdom): Colleagues \r\nwill be aware of the letter I wrote to the President on \r\n1 October (A/63/461), enclosing a note of issues raised \r\nby the Serbian request for the General Assembly to \r\nseek an advisory opinion from the International Court \r\nof Justice on the legality of Kosovo’s declaration of \r\nindependence. \r\n Let me start by making clear that the United \r\nKingdom is a strong supporter of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. We have for many years accepted the \r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction. We are one of only 65 \r\nStates with a current optional clause declaration, under \r\narticle 36 (2) of the Court’s Statute, giving the Court \r\njurisdiction over a wide range of matters. We support \r\nthe use of the Court by Member States to resolve their \r\ndisputes and the right of United Nations institutions to \r\nseek advisory opinions on questions affecting the \r\nperformance of their functions. \r\n Why, it might be asked, are we now raising \r\nquestions about the Serbian request? The reason is that \r\nthe Serbian request is primarily for political rather than \r\nlegal reasons. It is designed to slow down Kosovo’s \r\nemergence as a widely recognized independent nation, \r\nplaying its part in the international institutions of the \r\nworld. Many members of the United Nations emerged \r\ninto independence during what, at the time, were \r\ncontroversial circumstances. These circumstances \r\nnormalize over time and the clock of history is rarely \r\nturned back. Kosovo’s independence is and will remain \r\na reality. The Government of Serbia will have to decide \r\nhow it comes to terms with that reality. \r\n Kosovo’s independence has now been recognized \r\nby 22 out of 27 member States of the European Union, \r\nan organization that Serbia aspires to join. We too want \r\nto see Serbia as a member of the European Union. To \r\nthat end, Serbia will need to work constructively with \r\nits future European Union partners to maximize \r\nstability in the region, including in Kosovo, so that we \r\ncan achieve our goal of bringing the whole region and \r\nits peoples to a stable and more prosperous future. \r\n A/63/PV.22\r\n \r\n3 08-54101 \r\n \r\n In Security Council debates on this issue, I have \r\nset out that the United Kingdom is confident in its legal \r\nposition as a State that has recognized the \r\nindependence of Kosovo following the final status \r\nprocess, which was conducted pursuant to Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). \r\n In terms of the draft resolution before us, my \r\ndelegation regrets that our Serbian colleagues have \r\ndeclined to seek a consensual way forward. They have, \r\non the contrary, decided to push this draft resolution \r\nthrough the General Assembly with minimal debate \r\nabout the issues. That is not the custom in the General \r\nAssembly, and it is regrettable that Serbia has decided \r\nto pursue that course. In the light of our reservations on \r\nmatters of both substance and procedure, the United \r\nKingdom will abstain on this resolution. \r\n If the resolution is adopted, the question will \r\nneed to be addressed against the background of the full \r\ncontext of the dissolution of Yugoslavia in so far as it \r\naffects Kosovo, starting with Belgrade’s unilateral \r\ndecision in 1989 to remove Kosovo’s autonomy \r\nthrough to events of the present day. \r\n Serbia complains about the unilateral declaration \r\nof Kosovo in February 2008. But it was Serbia that, in \r\na unilateral move of its own, rendered successful \r\nnegotiations impossible. In November 2006, while the \r\nUnited Nations status envoy was conducting talks, \r\nSerbia brought forward a new constitution that \r\nunilaterally reasserted control over Kosovo. That \r\nconstitution was narrowly approved by a referendum. \r\nBut well over a million Kosovo Albanians, people \r\nwhom Serbia was by its new constitution claiming as \r\nits own, were effectively excluded from voting. And \r\nthe effect of the constitution was to tie the hands of the \r\nSerbian negotiators to the point where they could not \r\neven accept a status-neutral proposal put forward by \r\nthe European Union. \r\n That status-neutral proposal in December 2007 \r\nrepresented the last chance for a negotiated settlement, \r\nand it was rejected by Serbia. So, in coordination with \r\nmany of the countries most closely involved in \r\nstabilizing the Balkans, Kosovo’s Assembly declared \r\nKosovo independent on 17 February 2008. The \r\ndeclaration committed Kosovo to full implementation \r\nof the United Nations envoy’s Comprehensive Proposal \r\nfor the Kosovo Status Settlement, including the most \r\nextensive safeguards for minority communities \r\nanywhere in Europe, together with international \r\nsupervision. In the past eight months, 48 countries \r\nhave recognized Kosovo as a sovereign independent \r\nState; and that number is set to grow. \r\n If this draft resolution is adopted, my delegation \r\ninvites the Court to proceed in accordance with the \r\nprinciple that, without prejudice to the advisory \r\nopinion being sought, all parties with an interest, \r\nincluding the Government of Kosovo, should be able to \r\npresent arguments on an equal footing. \r\n My Government’s overwhelming concern in its \r\npolicy towards the Balkans over this last 18 years has \r\nbeen to provide for peace and stability and to build a \r\nbasis for long-term prosperity in the region. Those \r\nprinciples continue to guide us today. The people of \r\nSerbia have made a strategic choice in their recent \r\nelection, one that my Government welcomes. We will \r\ndo what we can to facilitate Serbia’s integration into \r\nEurope. We will expect in return that the Government \r\nof Serbia will cooperate fully with the European Union \r\nin achieving stability in the southern Balkans for \r\ngenerations to come. Our disagreement with Serbia \r\nover the tactics that it is adopting on this particular \r\nissue will not distract us from our strategic objectives \r\nthat we believe are widely shared and advance the \r\ninterests of the people of the Balkans as a whole. \r\n Mr. Neritani (Albania): Each and every Member \r\nState has the right to operate within our current \r\nCharter-defined system and to use the rules of \r\nprocedure, including even some loopholes, in order to \r\nclarify an issue, solve a dispute between parties, \r\nremedy a situation and/or seek an opinion. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice is a very well respected \r\nbody in this regard and we strongly support it. \r\n This institutional right comes together with the \r\nresponsibility to exercise it objectively and in good \r\nfaith. This nexus becomes more relevant because the \r\nissue at hand involves all of us as Members of this \r\ninstitution. The sense of purpose and the practical \r\nutility of this exercise must be based on that equation. \r\n Let us go one small step further. The intentional \r\nreduction of the complex issue of Kosovo into a simple \r\naspect, namely, the legal one, is an attempt to establish \r\na situation outside of its context, cutting it away from \r\nits root causes. In other words, it attempts to establish a \r\nfalse connection between cause and effect. \r\n The General Assembly deserves the truth and \r\ninformation that are known on the subject. Any \r\nA/63/PV.22  \r\n \r\n08-54101 4 \r\n \r\nintentional attempt to conceal the facts or to make a \r\npresentation based on half-truths is not a good-faith \r\nattempt in approaching this issue. Our institution’s \r\ncompetence and its ability to take ownership of this \r\nissue hinge on a fair approach to this question. \r\n The involvement of the General Assembly \r\nmembership in this debate must have a purpose. I \r\nbelieve that the General Assembly need not be engaged \r\nin a debate aimed at meeting certain bars in the \r\ndomestic politics of a particular Member State, bars \r\nraised artificially because of very painful events in the \r\nrecent past. \r\n A projected prolongation of the Kosovo \r\nrecognition process is not in and of itself a good reason \r\nand a bona fide purpose for engaging the General \r\nAssembly membership in this debate. We have to be \r\nengaged and resolve, not freeze or block, certain \r\ndevelopments that are proving to have a positive result \r\non the ground for the present and the future. \r\n In its known historical and political \r\ndevelopments, Kosovo constitutes a unique case. This \r\nis true for each and every person that knows the facts \r\non the ground and views them without any speculation \r\nor bias. For the sake of a violent and non-consensual \r\nbreak-up of the former Yugoslavia, a biblical exodus of \r\n1 million Kosovar Albanians and thousands killed and \r\ndisappeared, including into mass graves, took place \r\nonly nine years ago. That State-run ethnic cleansing \r\nenterprise and genocide was stopped thanks to the \r\nintervention of international community, which, \r\nentirely legally, administered Kosovo until its \r\ndeclaration of independence. \r\n The potential engagement of the International \r\nCourt of Justice (ICJ) in this unique case, as it is \r\npresented in the draft resolution before us — that is, \r\nout of context — and the offering of an opinion based \r\nupon an intentionally singled-out element — the legal \r\none — could lay the groundwork for interpretations \r\nthat could have wider latitude and scale of application. \r\nWhile not anything close to a theoretically established \r\nprecedent, this would reflect a top-down approach. \r\nKosovo in and of itself is not a precedent. Pushing the \r\nenvelope on this question by engaging the General \r\nAssembly might create a precedent, although a \r\nnegative one, with potentially bad applications \r\nelsewhere. \r\n On another technical matter, the wording \r\n“unilaterally declared independence”: the word \r\n“unilateral” is not a factual representation, but a biased \r\ninterpretation. The legal act of declaration of \r\nindependence may have different qualifiers. As the \r\nGeneral Assembly is discussing an issue to be referred \r\nto the ICJ, biased rhetoric that deviates from a factual \r\nrepresentation of the circumstances on the ground is \r\nnot a good reflection on the competence of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n We respectfully disagree with this attempt, which \r\nis logistically legal, but which is in essence a \r\nmanipulative attempt to stall the process of recognition \r\nof Kosovo and to cause as much detrimental effect on \r\nthe ground as possible. We believe that the Balkans \r\ndeserve to channel these enormous energies towards \r\nbuilding our common future with prosperity for all of \r\nus. Old stereotypes of getting even are outdated, \r\neverywhere. \r\n We call upon other members to vote against draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.2. \r\n Mr. İlkin (Turkey): Peace and stability in the \r\nBalkans have always been of the utmost importance for \r\nTurkey. In line with this, we are determined to further \r\nour relations with all Balkan countries in all fields. In \r\nthis context, we value the close relations we have with \r\nSerbia and believe that that country’s welfare and \r\nstability are indispensable to the well-being of the \r\ngreater Balkan region and of Europe. \r\n At the same time, Turkey has historical ties and \r\nstrong fraternal bonds with the Kosovar people. Turkey \r\nwas one of the first countries to have recognized \r\nKosovo, and it is our view that this recognition is also \r\nconsistent with international law. In fact, 48 countries \r\nhave recognized Kosovo, and that only bolsters that \r\nconclusion. \r\n We understand the particular reasons that have \r\nled Serbia to seek an advisory opinion from the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ). However, we do \r\nnot think that this will help achieve the desired and \r\nimmediately needed atmosphere of peace, stability and \r\nsecurity in the Balkans. \r\n On the other hand, Turkey strongly supports the \r\nICJ as the principal judiciary organ of the United \r\nNations. Therefore, out of respect for the ICJ, Turkey \r\nwill not challenge the right of Serbia to have recourse \r\nto the ICJ and will not participate in the vote. \r\n Ms. DiCarlo (United States of America): After \r\nyears of war, post-communist transition and deep \r\n A/63/PV.22\r\n \r\n5 08-54101 \r\n \r\nhardship and suffering, the people of the Balkans, \r\nincluding those in Serbia and Kosovo, have rejected \r\nthe destructive nationalism that brought them such \r\nmisery in the 1990s. They seek a future as integrated, \r\nprosperous citizens of Europe. \r\n Under the leadership of a democratically elected, \r\nmulti-ethnic Government, the Republic of Kosovo \r\ntoday is at peace. The Government in Pristina has \r\nscrupulously followed the comprehensive proposal for \r\nthe Kosovo status settlement developed by the \r\nSecretary-General’s Special Envoy. \r\n Kosovo has adopted a far-reaching constitution \r\nand has enacted 41 pieces of legislation to implement \r\nthe comprehensive proposal. These include specific \r\nprovisions which protect the rights of all ethnic \r\nminorities as well as the religious and cultural heritage \r\nof the population. Kosovo’s Government has also acted \r\nwith vision in seeking strong relations with all its \r\nneighbours, including Serbia. \r\n For its part, Serbia is on the path to European \r\nintegration, having recently signed a Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union. \r\n The United States firmly believes that our \r\ncommon concern should be to focus our efforts to help \r\nshape this European future for Serbia and Kosovo. \r\nSpecifically, we are extending economic and political \r\nsupport to both of these countries. We hope they will \r\nintegrate further into international markets and \r\nstructures, which will guarantee peace and prosperity \r\nfor all of the region’s peoples. \r\n However, we do not think that the draft resolution \r\nproposed by Serbia advances that goal. Let me make \r\nclear that the United States offers its full support to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) and its role in \r\nproviding advisory opinion in appropriate \r\ncircumstances. \r\n In regard to the specific question before us, on \r\nreferring the declaration of independence of Kosovo \r\nProvisional Institutions of Self-Governance to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, we respectfully suggest \r\nthat an advisory opinion on this question is \r\nunnecessary and unhelpful. Therefore, the United \r\nStates will vote against referral. \r\n As a practical matter, Kosovo’s independence is \r\nirreversible. Forty-eight countries have recognized \r\nKosovo as an independent State, including 22 of the 27 \r\nmembers of the European Union. We are confident that \r\nrecognition of Kosovo’s independence by an ever-\r\nincreasing number of States is consistent with \r\ninternational law. \r\n We do not think it appropriate or fair to the Court \r\nto ask it to opine on what is essentially a matter that is \r\nreserved to the judgement of Member States. We ask \r\nmembers to consider the potential consequences if \r\nother Members or separatist movements within their \r\ncountries were to seize upon language, in any opinion \r\nthe Court might render, to bolster their own claims for \r\nor against independence. \r\n Should this draft resolution go forward, the Court \r\nwill, understandably, have to look at the referred \r\nquestion with extreme care, taking into account the \r\nparticular context in which the events leading to \r\nKosovo’s declaration occurred. Kosovo must be \r\nviewed within the context of the violent dissolution of \r\nthe former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The policies of that \r\nperiod led the Security Council to adopt resolution \r\n1244 (1999), which authorized the United Nations to \r\nadminister Kosovo and called for a political process to \r\ndetermine Kosovo’s status. After intensive \r\nnegotiations, the United Nations Special Envoy \r\nrecommended to the Secretary-General that Kosovo \r\nbecome an independent State. It is also important that \r\nthe Court hear from the States most directly interested \r\nin this matter — Serbia and Kosovo — on an equal \r\nbasis, as well as from the many other States that can be \r\nexpected to make contributions to the Court’s \r\nconsideration of the case. \r\n The United States welcomes and supports the \r\nremarkable progress made in the Balkan region \r\ntowards building stable, multi-ethnic democracies and \r\nlaying the groundwork for growth and development. \r\nAlthough we may disagree with Serbia on the issue \r\nbefore us today, the United States will work closely \r\nwith Serbia and all other countries in South-Eastern \r\nEurope to advance our shared vision of a Europe that is \r\nwhole, free and at peace. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I am \r\ngrateful for the opportunity to express the legal opinion \r\nof the Government of Mexico on this important issue. \r\n Draft resolution A/63/L.2, submitted by Serbia, is \r\nbased on the prerogative, conferred on the General \r\nAssembly in Article 96 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, to request the International Court of Justice to \r\ngive an advisory opinion on any legal question. \r\nA/63/PV.22  \r\n \r\n08-54101 6 \r\n \r\n Since the founding of the United Nations, Mexico \r\nhas been a firm and constant promoter of the principles \r\nof justice and international law enshrined in the \r\nCharter and of the International Court of Justice, which \r\nis the jurisdictional body par excellence for the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes arising from the \r\ninterpretation of international law. \r\n The rule of law, to which we, the members of the \r\ninternational community, are subject, is possible only if \r\nit is equipped with effective jurisdictional mechanisms \r\nfor the peaceful resolution of disputes arising from \r\nspecific interpretations or applications of international \r\nlaw. The International Court of Justice, as the principal \r\njudicial organ at the international level, makes an \r\ninvaluable contribution to consolidating the rule of law \r\nthrough its opinions on specific legal issues arising in \r\nthe exercise of its advisory jurisdiction. \r\n The General Assembly, for its part, also plays an \r\nimportant role in consolidating the rule of law by \r\nentrusting to the Court — and thereby strengthening \r\nit — specific legal issues on which there is some \r\ndisagreement. In Mexico’s opinion, the initiative and \r\nthe text of Serbia’s request for an advisory opinion are \r\nin keeping with the framework established in \r\nparagraph 2 of article 65 of the Statute of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. Likewise, draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.2 fully meets the requirements set \r\nout in the Charter of the United Nations whereby the \r\nGeneral Assembly may request an advisory opinion \r\nfrom the International Court of justice on a specific \r\nlegal question referred to it. \r\n In the light of all those considerations, Mexico \r\nwill vote in favour of the draft resolution. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this item. \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.2. In that connection, I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department of General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): In connection with draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.2, I wish to place on record the \r\nfollowing statement of programme budget implications \r\non behalf of the Secretary-General, in accordance with \r\nrule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n By draft resolution A/63/L.2, the General \r\nAssembly would decide, in accordance with Article 96 \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, to request the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, pursuant to article 65 of \r\nthe Statute of the Court, to render an advisory opinion \r\non the following question: “Is the unilateral declaration \r\nof independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-\r\nGovernment of Kosovo in accordance with \r\ninternational law?” \r\n Should the draft resolution be adopted, the Court \r\nwould proceed to establish the scope of the work \r\narising from the request. Resources have been provided \r\nin the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 \r\nfor the Court to provide advisory opinions as requested \r\nby organs of the United Nations and specialized \r\nagencies. It is anticipated, however, that, owing to the \r\ncomplexity of the question on which the Court is \r\nrequested in the draft resolution to render an advisory \r\nopinion, adoption of the draft resolution is expected to \r\ngive rise to additional resource requirements. \r\n On the basis of a determination by the Court of \r\nthe scope of work, a detailed statement of programme \r\nbudget implications would be submitted to the General \r\nAssembly for its consideration during its present \r\nsession. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now \r\ncall on those representatives who wish to speak in \r\nexplanation of vote before the voting. May I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\n Mrs. Miculescu (Romania): My delegation \r\nwould like to underline the following before the voting. \r\nCompliance with international law is the very essence \r\nof our Organization and the matrix on which we strive \r\nto build international peace, stability and security. \r\nDraft resolution A/63/L.2 contains a question that is \r\nfully in line with the simple right of recourse to \r\ninternational law, to which any United Nations \r\nMember is entitled to benefit under the Charter itself. \r\n Romania fully trusts the advisory opinions of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the main judicial organ \r\nof the United Nations, a prominent promoter and \r\nguardian of international law. We are absolutely sure \r\nthat its opinion on the question raised in the draft \r\nresolution will assist us in making decisions in the \r\nfuture, in particular when fundamental issues such as \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake. \r\n A/63/PV.22\r\n \r\n7 08-54101 \r\n \r\n In the light of those considerations, Romania has \r\ndecided to vote in favour of draft resolution A/63/L.2. \r\n Mr. Mlynár (Slovakia): Slovakia, as a matter of \r\nprinciple, respects the right of every Member State to \r\nseek advisory opinions from the International Court of \r\nJustice as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations and one of the principal organs of the United \r\nNations. In that context, Slovakia will vote in favour of \r\nthe General Assembly draft resolution submitted by \r\nSerbia that is before us today. \r\n Mr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): Panama \r\nhas decided to vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.2, whereby the General Assembly would \r\nrequest an advisory opinion of the International Court \r\nof Justice concerning the legality of the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence by Kosovo, because we \r\nbelieve in the peaceful settlement of disputes. We \r\nsupport the rule of law and believe in the authority, \r\ncapability and independence of the International Court \r\nof Justice. Panama is voting on the understanding that \r\nall parties, in particular the authorities of Serbia and \r\nKosovo, will be given the opportunity to express their \r\nviews before the Court. \r\n While we support the draft resolution being \r\nconsidered, at the same time I wish to make it clear \r\nthat our support does not affect or predetermine the \r\npolitical decision that Panama may or may not take to \r\nrecognize the independence of Kosovo. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): Egypt believes that the \r\nagenda item in question should be considered strictly \r\nwithin the legal and judicial context. Our view is based \r\non the following considerations. \r\n First, every Member State has the right to request \r\nan advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice and the General Assembly has the responsibility \r\nto grant that request in accordance with Article 96 of \r\nthe Charter. Egypt believes in the importance of the \r\nlegal and moral values of the Court’s judgments and \r\nopinions and the important role it has to play in \r\nresolving international conflicts with the needed \r\nobjectivity, independence and neutrality in a manner \r\nthat would enhance the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. \r\n Secondly, Egypt is committed to the collective \r\nposition of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) \r\nreflected in many NAM documents, the latest of which \r\nis the final document of the fifteenth ministerial \r\nconference of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in \r\nTeheran from 27 to 30 July 2008, in which the \r\nMovement \r\n“Invites also the General Assembly, the other \r\norgans of the United Nations and the specialized \r\nagencies duly authorized, to request advisory \r\nopinions of the International Court of Justice on \r\nlegal questions arising within the scope of their \r\nactivities”. \r\nIt is clear, in our opinion, that the question is a legal \r\nand not a political issue and thus falls within the \r\npurview of the General Assembly in that regard. \r\n Thirdly, strengthening the role of the United \r\nNations and in particular that of the General Assembly \r\nwhen dealing with issues related to sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity, as two of the main principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and of international law, entails \r\nrecognition of the pivotal role of the International \r\nCourt of Justice as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nOrganization. The General Assembly should not shy \r\naway from its responsibility to establish the necessary \r\nlegal and judicial opinions in this case and in any case \r\nthat entails a dispute in the application of the principles \r\nof the Charter or any principles of international law. \r\nTherefore, Egypt will vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution submitted by the Republic of Serbia in \r\ndocument A/63/L.2. \r\n Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAs is well known, the Spanish Government believes \r\nthat respect for international law is the fundamental \r\nprinciple governing the actions of States and \r\ninternational organizations, and in particular the United \r\nNations, in the context of their international relations. \r\nSpain has therefore placed that fundamental principle \r\nat the core of all its actions in the international arena, \r\nwhile at the same time giving the United Nations an \r\nunparalleled leading role in that regard. \r\n It is also well known that the Spanish \r\nGovernment attaches great importance to the correct \r\nfunctioning of the principal organs of the Organization, \r\nincluding the General Assembly and the International \r\nCourt of Justice, and to interaction among those organs \r\nto promote the achievement of the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations, in accordance with \r\nthe Charter. \r\n In that regard, we feel that, in the general interest \r\nof the Organization and the international community as \r\nA/63/PV.22  \r\n \r\n08-54101 8 \r\n \r\na whole, it would be advisable to provide the Assembly \r\nwith an authorized opinion of the main judicial body of \r\nthe United Nations on the legal aspects of issues that, \r\nsuch as the present one regarding Kosovo, have been \r\nthe object of diverse interpretations by Member States. \r\n Moreover, we believe that it will ultimately fall to \r\nthis Assembly and the other bodies of the United \r\nNations to draw the conclusions they deem appropriate \r\nconcerning the advisory opinion that the International \r\nCourt of Justice will pronounce at the proper moment, \r\nwithout, at this stage at least, drawing any preliminary \r\nconclusions or conditioning in any way the actions of \r\nthe main judicial organ of the United Nations, which \r\nenjoys full independence and impartiality in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nits statutes. \r\n Therefore, Spain will vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution submitted by Serbia, contained in document \r\nA/63/L.2. \r\n Mr. Mourikis (Greece): As a matter of principle, \r\nGreece believes that every State has the prerogative to \r\nrequest an advisory opinion of the International Court \r\nof Justice on issues of importance and relevance to \r\ninternational law. We would also like to stress that we \r\nrecognize and respect the authority and competence of \r\nthe Court to investigate issues of international law and \r\nexpress views and opinions on such topics. \r\n As regards the draft resolution submitted by \r\nSerbia (A/63/L.2) on referring the issue of the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo to \r\nthe International Court of Justice and request that it be \r\nexamined for its legality in accordance with \r\ninternational law, Greece is of the opinion that such a \r\nrequest is based on international law and practice and \r\nwe would like to express our support for it. \r\n We believe that the text of that draft resolution is \r\nbased on the inalienable right of every State to seek the \r\nadvice and opinions of the most relevant juridical \r\nauthority within the United Nations system through the \r\napproval of the General Assembly. \r\n Therefore, Greece will vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution submitted by Serbia. \r\n Mr. Ripert (France) (spoke in French): On \r\n17 February 2008, the Assembly of Kosovo declared \r\nthe independence of the Republic of Kosovo. That \r\ndeclaration of independence marked the end of a very \r\nspecific historical sequence — the violent \r\ndismemberment of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, \r\nfollowed by a long period of international \r\nadministration under the aegis of the United Nations. \r\n It is also the result of the process of defining \r\nKosovo’s status, which was provided for by Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). The common \r\nEuropean prospects offered to Kosovo and to Serbia \r\nare also a very specific characteristic of the situation. \r\nThe independence of Kosovo is thus a sui generis case \r\nthat does not call into question the issues of \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity that lie at the very \r\ncore of international relations. \r\n In such conditions, on 18 February France \r\ndecided to recognize the new State, as have 22 of the \r\n27 members of the European Union since then. Since \r\nthe entry into force of the Constitution on 15 June, \r\nmoreover, the Republic of Kosovo possesses a \r\nlegislative framework that conforms to European \r\nnorms and values and provides a framework for \r\nprotecting all communities living in Kosovo. \r\n In that context, France marked its disagreement \r\nwith Serbia’s draft resolution (A/63/L.2), which would \r\nrequest an advisory opinion of the International Court \r\nof Justice on the legality on the declaration of \r\nindependence of Kosovo. France fully backs the Court, \r\nwhich is the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, but to us the request for an advisory opinion \r\nproposed by Serbia is neither useful, since the situation \r\nof independent Kosovo recognized by 48 sovereign \r\nStates seems to us to be devoid of any legal \r\nuncertainties, nor appropriate, since it does not \r\ncontribute to the necessary easing of tensions and \r\ncould complicate the European prospects for the \r\nwestern Balkans. \r\n In those conditions, France will abstain in the \r\nvoting. \r\n To overcome the divisions of the past, Europe \r\noffered a European future to the people of the western \r\nBalkans. France remains dedicated to that basic goal, \r\nwhich should be a priority for all. We remain especially \r\nresolved to help Serbia to engage on the path of a \r\nEuropean future. The integration of Serbia into the \r\nEuropean family is important to the stability of the \r\nregion. \r\n In that regard, France reiterates its belief that \r\nSerbia can accelerate the progress of its rapprochement \r\nwith Europe. It recalls that the European Union has \r\n A/63/PV.22\r\n \r\n9 08-54101 \r\n \r\nalso expressed its readiness to assist Kosovo in its \r\neconomic and political development by providing it \r\nwith at a clear European prospect. \r\n Lastly, France wishes to underscore the European \r\nUnion’s frequently reiterated resolve to play a lead role \r\nin stabilizing the region, particularly through the \r\ndeployment of the European Union Rule of Law \r\nMission throughout Kosovo. In that respect, France \r\nencourages the Serbian Government to adopt a \r\nconstructive approach to the efforts undertaken by the \r\nEuropean Union to contribute to peace and stability in \r\nthe Western Balkans. \r\n Mr. Hadjimichael (Cyprus): My delegation will \r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution contained in \r\ndocument A/63/L.2. We consider that, as a matter of \r\nprinciple, it is the prerogative of every State to seek an \r\nadvisory opinion from the International Court of \r\nJustice on matters that affect its vital interests and that \r\npertain to the fundamental principles of international \r\nlaw. \r\n We believe that the unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence by Kosovo’s provisional institutions is \r\nan issue that merits legal clarity and that the Court can \r\nprovide valuable guidance to States thereon through \r\nthe exercise of its advisory function. \r\n Our decision to support the draft resolution \r\nbefore us is based on and forms an integral part of a \r\nprincipled policy that the Republic of Cyprus has \r\nconsistently advocated. It derives from our support for \r\nthe rule of law and the international legal order and our \r\nconviction that adherence to international law is an \r\nindispensable element that determines the conduct of \r\nStates in international relations. \r\n My Government will continue to caution against \r\nthe interpretation of international law according to \r\npolitical expediencies, and strongly to support the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, including through the tools \r\nprovided therein. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): Indonesia has been \r\nconsistent in expressing its preference for the path of \r\ndialogue and diplomacy in resolving the question of \r\nthe final status of Kosovo. That principled position \r\nremains. \r\n Indonesia has also been steadfast in upholding the \r\nrule of law and the Charter of the United Nations in \r\ngoverning relations among States. We deem it of \r\nparamount importance to maintain the integrity of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law. That \r\nprincipled position also remains. Paragraph 1 of Article \r\n96 of the Charter provides that “The General Assembly \r\nor the Security Council may request the International \r\nCourt of Justice to give an advisory opinion on any \r\nlegal question”. \r\n For the aforementioned reasons, Indonesia will \r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution (A/63/L.2) \r\ncurrently before the General Assembly on the request \r\nfor an advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice on whether the unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence of Kosovo is in accordance with \r\ninternational law. \r\n Mr. Malmierca Díaz (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba supports the legitimate right of any Member State \r\nto request an advisory opinion from the International \r\nCourt of Justice. The draft resolution contained in \r\ndocument A/63/L.2, introduced by Serbia, is an \r\nexpression of its legitimate right to request an advisory \r\nopinion of the Court concerning the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence by Kosovo.  \r\n Cuba believes that the draft resolution is in \r\nkeeping with the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nand international law. The draft resolution, moreover, \r\nis consistent with the positions adopted by the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement concerning the relationship \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the International \r\nCourt of Justice. For those reasons, Cuba will vote in \r\nfavour of draft resolution A/63/L.2. \r\n Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation will \r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/63/L.2. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice is an organ of this \r\nOrganization and my delegation has full confidence \r\nthat its decision will be important and inclusive of all \r\nopinions. While it may be true that 48 countries have \r\nrecognized Kosovo, it is also important to note that 144 \r\ncountries of this Assembly have not taken that \r\ndecision. It is for that reason that we support the right \r\nof the Republic of Serbia to seek the advice of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. \r\n Mr. Oussein (Comoros) (spoke in French): We \r\nhave every confidence in the impartiality of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and the role it must play \r\nin international conflicts to preserve the primacy of \r\ninternational law. The Union of the Comoros is also \r\nattached to the fundamental principle of respect for the \r\nterritorial integrity of States and condemns any form of \r\nA/63/PV.22  \r\n \r\n08-54101 10 \r\n \r\nsecession that would undermine the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the Organization. The Union of the \r\nComoros will therefore vote in favour of draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.2. \r\n Mr. Ballestero (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe have adopted a principled position of respect for \r\nthe primacy of international law in conformity with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. That is why we have supported \r\nand continue to support the path chosen by Serbia on \r\nthe issue of Kosovo.  \r\n Everyone is aware of Costa Rica’s position on \r\nKosovo. As a State that is respectful of international \r\nlaw, we recognized their independence and have \r\nadopted a position that we deem legally valid. \r\nHowever, precisely because there are divergences in \r\nlegal interpretations of the situation, we are convinced \r\nthat an advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice would be desirable and bring clarity to the \r\ndiscussion.  \r\n As a State that respects international law, we will \r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/63/L.2. We believe \r\nthat the advisory opinion will certainly assist all \r\nMember States in making their own decisions. \r\n Mr. Baghaei Hamaneh (Islamic Republic of \r\nIran): The Islamic Republic of Iran would like to \r\nreaffirm its firm commitment to and high respect for \r\nthe principles of the pacific settlement of disputes and \r\nthe rule of law at the international level, as embodied \r\nin the United Nations Charter. My delegation’s vote \r\ntoday in favour of draft resolution A/63/L.2 should be \r\nregarded as an indication of our principled \r\ncommitment to that high principle. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): \r\nAlgeria firmly supports the work of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and believes in the primacy of \r\ninternational law in international relations. Moreover, \r\ndraft resolution A/63/L.2 before us contains no \r\nelements of a political or controversial nature. Algeria \r\nbelieves it to be the prerogative of any State to request \r\nan advisory opinion of the Court, in conformity with \r\nArticle 96 of the Charter. For those reasons, Algeria \r\nwill vote in favour of draft resolution A/63/L.2. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote before the \r\nvoting. The Assembly will now take action on draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.2.  \r\n A recorded vote has been requested. \r\n A recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour: \r\n Algeria, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, \r\nAzerbaijan, Belarus, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Chile, China, \r\nCongo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican \r\nRepublic, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, \r\nEritrea, Fiji, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, \r\nHonduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic \r\nRepublic of), Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kenya, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Madagascar, \r\nMauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, Myanmar, \r\nNamibia, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, \r\nPanama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, \r\nPhilippines, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, Serbia, Singapore, \r\nSlovakia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, \r\nSri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, Syrian \r\nArab Republic, Timor-Leste, United Republic of \r\nTanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, \r\nZambia, Zimbabwe. \r\nAgainst: \r\n Albania, Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated \r\nStates of), Nauru, Palau, United States of \r\nAmerica. \r\nAbstaining: \r\n Afghanistan, Andorra, Armenia, Australia, \r\nAustria, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, \r\nBarbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, \r\nBulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, \r\nColombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, \r\nEstonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, \r\nGhana, Grenada, Haiti, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, \r\nItaly, Japan, Jordan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Monaco, \r\nMongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Portugal, \r\nQatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, \r\nSaint Lucia, Samoa, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, \r\nSenegal, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Sweden, \r\nSwitzerland, Thailand, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Togo, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland, Vanuatu, Yemen. \r\n A/63/PV.22\r\n \r\n11 08-54101 \r\n \r\n Draft resolution A/63/L.2 was adopted by \r\n77 votes to 6, with 74 abstentions (resolution \r\n63/3). \r\n [Subsequently, the delegations of Ecuador, \r\nEthiopia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nand the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela advised \r\nthe Secretariat that they had intended to vote in \r\nfavour; the delegation of Tonga advised the \r\nSecretariat that it had intended to abstain.] \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I call on the \r\nrepresentative of Liberia on a point of order. \r\n Mrs. Osode (Liberia): Liberia voted against the \r\ndraft resolution; I repeatedly pressed the red button, \r\nbut without result. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have been \r\ninformed by the Secretariat – which is so informing the \r\nrepresentative of Liberia – that, in accordance with the \r\nprovisions of Article 19 of the Charter, Liberia may not \r\nvote. \r\n Before giving the floor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote, may I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n I now call on representatives who wish to speak \r\nin explanation of vote on the resolution just adopted. \r\n Sir John Sawers (United Kingdom): I regret the \r\nfact that the vote of Liberia could not be counted. It \r\nhas been clear from the performance this morning that \r\nwe are having technical problems in the General \r\nAssembly and it would have surely been right to have \r\ntaken into account the fact that those technical \r\nproblems extended to the vote as well as to the \r\nspeakers. \r\n In my statement in the debate, I set out a number \r\nof reservations on the part of the United Kingdom with \r\nregards to the draft resolution which has just been \r\nadopted. Those reservations led us to abstain in the \r\nvoting, notwithstanding our long-standing support for \r\nthe International Court of Justice. \r\n It is striking that more Member States felt unable \r\nto support the resolution than voted in favour of it. We \r\nmight infer from this that we are far from alone in \r\nhaving deep reservations. The United Kingdom \r\nwelcomes the use of the advisory jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt in appropriate cases, but we question the utility \r\nof the question being raised by Serbia. An advisory \r\nopinion cannot in itself determine Kosovo’s status. \r\n The position of the United Kingdom reflects our \r\nconviction that implementation of the comprehensive \r\nsettlement proposed by an independent Kosovo under \r\ninternational supervision offers the best chance for \r\nKosovo, Serbia and the region to achieve peace, \r\nstability and prosperity. \r\n The United Kingdom also regrets the lack of \r\nsubstantive debates within the General Assembly on \r\nthe draft resolution, including on the context and the \r\nformulation of the question and on the desirability of \r\nsignalling, in the interest of fairness, that Kosovo \r\nshould be allowed to present its arguments to the \r\nCourt. \r\n For all those reasons, the United Kingdom \r\nabstained in the voting on the resolution. Nevertheless, \r\nwe recognize that the question which the General \r\nAssembly has decided to ask the Court raises \r\nsignificant issues of international law. We are confident \r\nof our legal position as a State that recognized the \r\nindependence of Kosovo following the final status \r\nprocess, which was conducted pursuant to Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). \r\n The United Kingdom looks forward to engaging \r\nconstructively with the Court to assist in its \r\nconsiderations of those important issues. In parallel, \r\nwe look to Serbia to engage constructively with the \r\nEuropean Union on promoting stability in the region. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): Let me begin by saying \r\nthat Canada fully supports the role of the International \r\nCourt of Justice as an instrument in the pacific \r\nsettlement of disputes. Canada’s vote today is not \r\nintended to detract from that important principle. It is \r\nour view, however, that the case raises highly political \r\nmatters that are unsuitable for judicial review. \r\n Moreover, Canada is of the view that the referral \r\nput before us in resolution 63/3 and the frame of \r\nreference it purports to set for the International Court \r\nof Justice are unlikely to result in an advisory opinion \r\nthat could usefully contribute to fostering stability in \r\nthe region. At a minimum, the resolution would have \r\nbenefited from the inclusion of additional context to \r\nreflect the unique circumstances of the case. For those \r\nreasons, Canada abstained in the voting on the \r\nresolution. \r\nA/63/PV.22  \r\n \r\n08-54101 12 \r\n \r\n Let me conclude by saying that Canada takes the \r\nview that, as a matter of basic fairness, Kosovo should \r\nbe given the opportunity to present its case to the \r\nCourt. \r\n Mr. Pereyra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru \r\nrecognized Kosovo on 22 February 2008, \r\nunderstanding that in this case there is a set of peculiar \r\nhumanitarian circumstances that make it unique. In that \r\nregard, Peru’s decision to recognize Kosovo constitutes \r\na sovereign act of its foreign policy. In Peru’s view, the \r\nlegality of Kosovo’s independence is, in the light of \r\ninternational law, fully justified by the peculiar \r\ncircumstances that make this an exceptional case. \r\n Peru reiterates its firm commitment to respect the \r\nnorms and principles of international law and, in \r\nparticular, the principle of peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. Therefore, Peru reaffirms its emphatic \r\nbacking of the International Court of Justice as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, whether \r\nit is acting in its judicial capacity or whether recourse \r\nis made to it for an advisory opinion. \r\n In the current case, Peru would like to highlight \r\nthat Article 96 of the Charter clearly establishes that it \r\nis within the competence of the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council or other organs or specialized \r\nagencies that are authorized by the General Assembly \r\nto request advisory opinions of the Court on legal \r\nmatters. Thus, Peru respects Serbia’s right to place \r\nsuch a request before the General Assembly. Given the \r\nparticular circumstances of the case, the relevance of \r\nKosovo’s arguments and points of view must be \r\nconsidered. Lastly, Peru would, once again, emphasize \r\nthat it will continue to act, in connection with this case, \r\nin keeping with its long tradition of respect for the \r\nnorms and principles of international law, specifically \r\nthose that govern peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n Mr. Matussek (Germany): Germany is strongly \r\ncommitted to the International Court of Justice and to \r\nthe important role of international law in governing \r\nrelations between States. However, any action by the \r\nGeneral Assembly should contribute to the aim of \r\nadvancing a just, lasting and stable settlement in \r\nKosovo and in the Western Balkans as a whole. It is in \r\nthis spirit that Germany has approached the request for \r\nan advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice on the specific issue raised today by the \r\nRepublic of Serbia. \r\n Again, in this vein, we do not believe that the \r\nresolution we have just adopted will help advance this \r\ncause. Moreover, we remain doubtful that an advisory \r\nopinion of the Court would serve the stated purpose, in \r\naffording guidance to the General Assembly on \r\nquestions of international law relevant to the \r\nperformance of its functions. In any case, Germany \r\nwould trust that the Court will proceed according to the \r\nprinciple of fairness and will be hearing arguments as \r\nappropriate. At the same time and out of this respect \r\nfor this Hall, we do not want to oppose the requests \r\nsupported by a considerable portion of the General \r\nAssembly’s members. It is for these reasons that \r\nGermany has chosen to abstain on the resolution. \r\n Mr. Argüello (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\npillar of the United Nations system is international \r\npeace and security. The principal organ of the \r\nOrganization with powers in this area is the Security \r\nCouncil. The whole of the collective security system is \r\nbased on the fact that Members of the United Nations \r\nare duty bound to abide by the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe Organization.  \r\n In the case of Kosovo, Security Council \r\nresolution 1244 (1999), for which Argentina voted in \r\nthe affirmative, establishes clearly the legal and \r\npolitical parameters for the solution to the situation of \r\nthe Kosovar minority in Serbia, ensuring the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia, as well \r\nas the settlement of the disputes through a negotiated \r\nagreement that is mutually accepted by all parties. \r\nArgentina believes that that resolution is clear. \r\nNevertheless, we join with the majority in agreeing to \r\nthe request for an advisory opinion on this matter. \r\n Ms. Lintonen (Finland): The International Court \r\nof Justice plays a crucial role in the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes and in the promotion and application of \r\ninternational law. It has made considerable \r\ncontributions to the development of international law, \r\nalso through its advisory powers.  \r\n Finland has recognized the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court since 1958 without any \r\nreservations. We have actively participated in efforts to \r\npromote wider acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction. \r\nWe have also supported the Secretary-General’s trust \r\nfund to assist States in the settlement of disputes \r\nthrough the Court. Consistent support for the Court and \r\nthe rule of law in international relations is an integral \r\npart of Finland’s foreign policy.  \r\n A/63/PV.22\r\n \r\n13 08-54101 \r\n \r\n However, Finland has abstained in the vote on the \r\nresolution. Our abstention is related to the subject of \r\nthe resolution. Finland is among the 48 countries that \r\nhave recognized Kosovo. While we do recognize that \r\nan advisory opinion on the subject of the request could \r\nhave the potential of clarifying important legal \r\nquestions, we are concerned about any developments \r\nthat may create uncertainty as to the status of Kosovo \r\nand the instabilities in the region. We also regret that \r\nthe Assembly has not decided to indicate, in the \r\nresolution, that Kosovo should be allowed to \r\nparticipate in the proceedings. In order for the court to \r\ndeliver a fully reasoned opinion of this topic, all \r\nrelevant actors should be able to present arguments on \r\nthe subject. \r\n Mr. Goledzinowski (Australia): Australia \r\nrecognizes the right of every State to raise matters \r\nbefore the General Assembly for consideration by the \r\nAssembly. In particular, we respect the right of Serbia \r\nto bring this request for an advisory opinion from the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to the Assembly. \r\nAustralia is a strong supporter of the International \r\nCourt of Justice as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations and recognizes that the advisory \r\njurisdiction of the Court is an important part of the \r\ninternational system established by the United Nations \r\nCharter. We assess the merits of requests for advisory \r\nopinions on a case by case basis. In this case, we were \r\nnot convinced of the merits of having the Court \r\nconsider this question and Australia was therefore \r\nunable to support this resolution. We consider that \r\nKosovo should be universally recognized as an \r\nindependent State in the interests of promoting peace \r\nand stability in the region. An advisory opinion would \r\nserve only to delay efforts for peace and stability. \r\n What is important now is that the international \r\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations and the \r\nEuropean Union, continue efforts to bring about a \r\nlasting and peaceful future for Kosovo and the region \r\nand that the Serbian Government continues to engage \r\nwith European and other parties in the interests of the \r\nstability and economic development of the region and \r\nits own future peace, stability and prosperity. \r\n As the question is now being referred to the Court \r\nfor an advisory opinion, we considered it appropriate \r\nfor Kosovo to be represented in the proceedings and to \r\npresent arguments in its own name. We would like to \r\nmake a final point. In responding to Liberia’s \r\nintervention, the President of the General Assembly \r\nindicated that Liberia cannot vote — at least that is the \r\nway it was rendered in English. I think it should be \r\nrecorded that, in fact, Liberia did vote. The fact that the \r\nvote was not registered because of a technical \r\ndifficulty is a matter of regret.  \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nColombia has asked to take the floor to explain its \r\nabstention in the voting on resolution 63/3, introduced \r\nunder agenda item 71, concerning the request for an \r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice \r\non whether the unilateral declaration of independence \r\nof Kosovo is in accordance with international law.  \r\n In so doing, I wish to underscore, first of all, the \r\nimportance that Colombia attaches to the jurisdiction \r\ngranted by the Charter of the United Nations to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to issue, upon request of \r\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council and other \r\nbodies, advisory opinions on legal questions relating to \r\nthe way in which they carry out their functions.  \r\n As a country that is respectful of international \r\nlaw, Colombia regards that function as a valuable tool \r\nfor the work of the Organization. My country’s \r\nabstention today, while recognizing that jurisdiction, is \r\nalso the result of a close consideration of the historical \r\ncircumstances that led to Kosovo’s declaration of \r\nindependence.  \r\n It should be recalled that a long series of events \r\nsince the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia led to \r\ninstability in the region that affected Kosovo, among \r\nothers, necessitating sustained and broad efforts on the \r\npart of the United Nations, and the Security Council in \r\nparticular, to promote a negotiated settlement among \r\nthe parties.  \r\n Colombia has absolutely no doubt about its \r\nrecognition of the independence of Kosovo. At the \r\nsame time, my country takes the view that transparency \r\nand compliance with the existing international legal \r\norder are essential and that the International Court of \r\nJustice, by means of an advisory opinion, can make an \r\nappropriate contribution to that important issue. \r\n Mr. Staur (Denmark): Denmark is a strong \r\nsupporter of the International Court of Justice. \r\nDenmark has for more than 50 years accepted the \r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction under Article 36 of the \r\nStatute of the Court. We have been a party to a number \r\nof contentious cases before the Court, thereby also in \r\npractice attesting to our belief in a rule-based \r\nA/63/PV.22  \r\n \r\n08-54101 14 \r\n \r\ninternational legal order and our support for the \r\nprinciple of peaceful settlement of disputes by \r\ninternational judicial bodies. Likewise, we believe that \r\nadvisory opinions may in some cases be an important \r\ntool for the relevant parties of the United Nations to \r\nseek clarification from the Court on legal questions.  \r\n After careful consideration, however, we decided \r\nto abstain in the voting on the Serbian proposal \r\nregarding an advisory opinion. We did so because we \r\nare not convinced of the utility of an advisory opinion \r\nin this case.  \r\n Denmark, together with 47 other countries so far, \r\nhas recognized Kosovo, and our legal position on \r\nKosovo’s independence is well known and quite clear. \r\nWe believe that stability, development and economic \r\nintegration in a broader European context are crucial to \r\nKosovo and to the entire region. In our view, those \r\naims are best served through a common effort to \r\naddress the real issues and challenges facing the \r\nregion. While Denmark will, of course, continue to \r\ncontribute to advancing prosperity and development in \r\nthe region, we are not convinced that the coming \r\nproceedings will help to advance a forward-looking \r\nagenda focused on improving the everyday lives of the \r\npeople in the western Balkan region. \r\n With the adoption of resolution 63/3, we expect \r\nthat the proceedings will be fair and comprehensive. \r\nWe believe it to be very important that all parties, \r\nincluding Kosovo, be given adequate access so that \r\nthey can present their views before the Court in their \r\nown name, and we expect that that will be the case. A \r\nfull picture of the complex background of Kosovo’s \r\nindependence must be presented to the Court. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): We believe that \r\nrequesting an advisory opinion from the International \r\nCourt of Justice is acceptable and can serve to stabilize \r\nthe region, even if there are also sound arguments \r\nagainst engaging the Court in a matter regarding a new \r\nState, given that most peoples enter statehood under \r\ndifficult and often turbulent circumstances.  \r\n Nevertheless, we believe that the initiative taken \r\nby the Government of Serbia has the better potential \r\nover time to bring stability to the region and to its \r\ncountries into European institutions. That is why we \r\nhave chosen to support the proposal by Serbia.  \r\n Our support cannot, however, be interpreted as \r\nbeing incompatible with Norway’s recognition of the \r\nRepublic of Kosovo as an independent State. We trust \r\nthat the Court will proceed according to established \r\nprinciples of judicial fairness and will be hearing and \r\nassessing all relevant arguments from all sides, \r\nincluding the Government of Kosovo. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): We \r\nhave always been attached to the promotion of the rule \r\nof law and international justice. That is why \r\nSwitzerland has supported the International Court of \r\nJustice since its founding and considers it to be an \r\nimportant instrument for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. Switzerland is also committed to peace, \r\nstability and socio-economic development in the region \r\nat issue. The present request for an advisory opinion \r\ncould create uncertainties and undermine the stability \r\nand economic development of the region.  \r\n It is on the basis of those considerations that we \r\ndecided to abstain in today’s voting. Switzerland \r\ndecided to recognize the independence of Kosovo after \r\nhaving carefully examined all relevant questions of \r\ninternational law. We are therefore convinced that the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, after having considered \r\nall the aspects at issue, will rule in favour of the \r\nconformity of the declaration of independence of \r\nKosovo with international law. We call on all interested \r\nparties to be guided by their political and economic \r\nfuture in Europe.  \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Mr. García González (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): El Salvador voted in favour of resolution \r\n63/3 concerning the request for an advisory opinion of \r\nthe International Court of Justice on whether the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo by \r\nthe Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of \r\nKosovo was in accordance with international law. \r\n El Salvador recognizes the option available to \r\nMember States, in keeping with Article 96 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, to request an advisory \r\nopinion from the International Court of Justice as a \r\nfundamental element of international law. The Court, \r\nin keeping with article 66 of its statute, shall issue an \r\nadvisory opinion on the question raised in order to \r\nresolve the dispute by peaceful means, making use of \r\nthe international community’s legal and political \r\ninstruments for that purpose. \r\n A/63/PV.22\r\n \r\n15 08-54101 \r\n \r\n In view of the juridical differences that exist \r\nbetween Member States, El Salvador has supported \r\ntoday’s initiative and trusts in the value of the \r\ncontribution that the International Court of Justice will \r\nbe able to make to resolve such sensitive issues within \r\nthe framework of international law as it applies to \r\nmatters regarding the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of States. Similarly, my delegation supports \r\nthe role played by the General Assembly in the matter, \r\nsince we feel that it is a juridical matter that falls under \r\nits jurisdiction. We reaffirm our commitment to \r\nworking to strengthen the General Assembly, in \r\nkeeping with the decision of the heads of State and \r\nGovernment adopted at the Millennium Summit. \r\n Mr. Tow (Singapore): Singapore is sympathetic \r\nto the desire of the people of Kosovo for control over \r\ntheir own destiny. It is undeniable that the Kosovars \r\nhave endured great suffering and terrible treatment in \r\nthe past. After the crimes committed against the people \r\nof Kosovo in the early 1990s, many countries, \r\nincluding Singapore, expressed sympathy and support \r\nfor some form of autonomy for Kosovo. However, \r\nSingapore has not, to date, supported Kosovo’s \r\nunilateral declaration of independence, as we are \r\nconcerned about the precedent that it could set in other \r\nparts of the world. Our strong preference is for the \r\nissue to be resolved peacefully by all parties \r\nconcerned.  \r\n In that regard, Singapore voted in favour of \r\nresolution 63/3 as we believe that this is a highly \r\ncomplex situation and that there is value in clarifying \r\nthe interpretation and application of international law. \r\nIn that regard, the International Court of Justice is the \r\nappropriate international body to provide an advisory \r\nopinion on the legality of Kosovo’s unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence. \r\n Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): Iceland supported the \r\ndraft resolution (A/63/L.2) submitted by Serbia. In so \r\ndoing, we departed from the position of some other \r\nStates that, like us, have recognized Kosovo’s \r\nindependence. We do nonetheless share their  \r\nviewpoints in respect to the developments that gave \r\nrise to Serbia’s proposal. Iceland voted in favour of \r\nresolution 63/3 on the basis of the fundamental \r\nimportance of international law, especially for small \r\nStates, and with full confidence in and support for the \r\nview that the rules and principles of international law \r\nshould always govern the behaviour of States. \r\n The Acting President: For purposes of \r\nclarification with respect to the voting, I wish to draw \r\nthe attention of the General Assembly to document \r\nA/63/350, which contains a letter from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral addressed to the President of the General \r\nAssembly outlining those Member States that are in \r\narrears under the terms of Article 19 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. I cite this document with respect to \r\none Member in particular, in relation to its vote. The \r\nGeneral Assembly took note of the document at its \r\n1st meeting, on 16 September.  \r\n I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Serbia to make a statement after the adoption \r\nof resolution 63/3. \r\n Mr. Jeremić (Serbia): Serbia believes that this is \r\na great day for this body and a great day for \r\ninternational law. Serbia wishes to thank the United \r\nNations for having provided us with the opportunity to \r\ndefend our case and to ask for support for our legal \r\nview in this Chamber. First and foremost, Serbia wants \r\nto thank the countries that have supported resolution \r\n63/3. We wholeheartedly thank those countries that \r\nhave demonstrated their solidarity with a course of \r\naction that in our opinion, upholds the very \r\nfoundational principles of international law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We look forward to \r\nworking constructively with the United Nations and all \r\nMember States regarding the process to determine the \r\nfuture status of our southern province. \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 71.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m. \r\n"
