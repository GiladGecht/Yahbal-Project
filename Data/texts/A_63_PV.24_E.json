Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. \r\n08-54686 (E) \r\n*0854686* \r\nPresident: Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 122 \r\n \r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations  \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/63/472)  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): If there is no \r\nproposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, may I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss \r\nthe report of the Fifth Committee that is before the \r\nAssembly today?  \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): Statements \r\nwill therefore be limited to explanations of vote. The \r\npositions of delegations regarding the recommendation \r\nof the Fifth Committee have been made clear in that \r\nCommittee and are reflected in that relevant official \r\nrecords. \r\n May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that \r\nwhen the same draft resolution is considered in a Main \r\nCommittee and in plenary meeting a delegation should, \r\nas far as possible, explain its vote only once. That is, \r\neither in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless \r\nthat delegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different \r\nfrom its vote in the Committee. May I remind \r\ndelegations that, also in accordance with General \r\nAssembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes.  \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take a decision in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on the \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee \r\nin paragraph 6 of its report. The Fifth Committee \r\nadopted the draft resolution, entitled “Scale of \r\nassessments for the apportionment of the expenses of \r\nthe United Nations: requests under Article 19 of the \r\nCharter”, without a vote. May I take it that the \r\nAssembly wishes to do the same? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 63/4). \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 122. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 67 and 68 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide \r\nand Other Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of \r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for \r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in \r\nthe Territory of Neighbouring States between \r\n1 January and 31 December 1994 \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/209) \r\n \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 2 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991  \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/210) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the Assembly to take note of the \r\nthirteenth annual report of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (A/63/209)? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the Assembly to take note of the \r\nfifteenth annual report of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (A/63/210)? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I call on \r\nMr. Dennis Byron, President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda. \r\n Mr. Byron: I am greatly honoured to address the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly. I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to extend my most sincere \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of this Assembly and to wish you a \r\nsuccessful and fulfilling tour of duty. \r\n I wish, with the greatest respect, to invite the \r\nAssembly to take a special interest in the Tribunal, as \r\ntimely action by the General Assembly is pivotal to the \r\ncompletion of its mandate within the projected time \r\nframes. \r\n Approximately 14 years ago, the international \r\ncommunity responded to the serious violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law committed throughout \r\nRwanda, which resulted in the killings of more than \r\n800,000 people and in other acts of violence, by \r\nestablishing the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda. \r\n The Tribunal’s mandate has been to contribute to \r\nthe process of national reconciliation and to the \r\nrestoration and maintenance of peace in Rwanda and \r\nthe Great Lakes region, as well as to ensure that \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law are halted \r\nand effectively redressed. \r\n I have found it remarkable that this political \r\ninstitution considered that the attainment of such a \r\npolitical objective could best be achieved through a \r\njudicial process. I am sure that there were those who \r\nhad questions and doubts about the ability of a judicial \r\ninstitution to address such an objective. \r\n But, today, whatever system is employed to \r\nmeasure the success of the venture, there can be no \r\ndoubt that peace has been restored and maintained in \r\nRwanda, that there is a credible and ongoing process of \r\nnational reconciliation, that many of the violations \r\nhave been addressed and that some have been \r\neffectively redressed. \r\n Of course, work remains to be done and \r\ncircumstances have given the Tribunal new tasks. But \r\nthere can be no doubt that the Tribunal has been a \r\ncentral and stabilizing instrument that has made major \r\nand lasting contributions to the establishment of \r\ninternational justice, peace and reconciliation, which \r\ncurrently prevail in the region. \r\n Among the most basic and important of the \r\nTribunal’s achievements has been the accumulation of \r\nan indisputable historical record, including testimonies \r\nof witnesses, testimonies of victims, testimonies of \r\naccused, documentary evidence, and video and audio \r\nrecordings. That record was invaluable to the Appeals \r\nChamber when it discredited and rejected the theory \r\nthat genocide and widespread or systematic attacks \r\nagainst civilian populations had not actually occurred \r\nin Rwanda in 1994. \r\n In a nutshell, the Tribunal has established an \r\nimportant, judicially verified factual record of those \r\natrocities. The importance and value of that record and \r\nthe archival collections of the Tribunal to national, \r\nregional and international history should not be \r\nunderestimated. They have contributed and will \r\ncontinue to contribute to the peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess in Rwanda and in the Great Lakes region, and \r\nthey offer a guide for addressing similar violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law in other areas of the \r\nworld. \r\n The Tribunal and its twin sister, the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), \r\nhave been the modern pioneers of a credible \r\ninternational criminal justice system. They have \r\ncontributed greatly to the development of substantive \r\ninternational criminal law and procedure. The 14 years \r\nof our activity have produced a substantial body of \r\njurisprudence, including the definitions of the elements \r\nof the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n3 08-54686 \r\n \r\nwar crimes, as well as of forms of responsibility, such \r\nas superior responsibility. Other international tribunals \r\nand courts will have a well-established foundation on \r\nwhich to build. The work of the Tribunal has \r\ntransformed the resolutions, treaties and conventions \r\nemanating from the United Nations into practical and \r\neffective tools to be used by the international criminal \r\njustice system in its efforts to end mass atrocities. \r\n The Tribunal has also fostered national \r\ncompliance with international obligations in the human \r\nrights sphere. For example, Rwanda has already \r\nabolished the death penalty in order to facilitate the \r\ntransfer of cases to its jurisdiction. The Trial Chamber’s \r\ndecision not to transfer the Munyakazi case to Rwanda \r\nwas recently upheld by the Appeals Chamber. The \r\nreasons given in the appellate judgement could lead to \r\neven further reforms, including a clarification of the \r\napplicable punishment for those transferred to Rwanda, \r\nthe exclusion of life imprisonment in solitary \r\nconfinement and strengthening the witness protection \r\nprogramme.  \r\n The referral proceedings have also put the \r\nspotlight on other countries that need to adopt domestic \r\nlegislation implementing the human rights treaties and \r\nconventions to which they are parties. The Tribunal’s \r\ninfluence, therefore, extends well beyond the Great \r\nLakes region, spreading what are arguably the highest \r\nideals of this body — its international standards of \r\nhuman rights — and transforming them from noble \r\naspirations into enforceable legislation and impartial \r\njudicial processes. \r\n I am honoured to present to the General \r\nAssembly today the Tribunal’s thirteenth annual report, \r\nwhich outlines the Tribunal’s activities from July 2007 \r\nto June 2008 and reflects those remarkable and \r\nongoing achievements and the Tribunal’s unwavering \r\ncommitment to its mandate. During the reporting \r\nperiod, all sections of the Tribunal worked vigorously, \r\ncombining their efforts to complete their tasks at the \r\nearliest possible date while upholding due process and \r\nguaranteeing the right to a fair trial for all those who \r\nare accused. \r\n Since July 2007, the Trial Chambers have issued \r\nmore than 400 interlocutory and pretrial decisions. \r\nThey rendered judgements and sentences involving \r\nfour accused. Decisions were delivered in five \r\napplications for referral of cases to national \r\njurisdictions. Two were successfully referred, while in \r\nthree cases the referral was denied. The evidence phase \r\nof trials involving seven accused has been completed. \r\nCurrently, there are 13 accused awaiting judgement. \r\nTrials involving 15 accused are in progress. The cases \r\nof four detainees, including one case of contempt, are \r\nat the pretrial stage. One accused who has been \r\nrecently transferred to the Tribunal made his initial \r\nappearance last week, pleading not guilty on all \r\ncharges against him. And there is one individual \r\nawaiting retrial as ordered by the Appeals Chamber \r\nthis past August in its Muvunyi judgement.  \r\n These figures show that by December 2009 the \r\nTrial Chambers will be required to deliver judgements \r\nagainst 34 accused persons. In addition, as a result of \r\nthe recent Appeals Chamber decision upholding the \r\ndenial of transferring the case of Munyakazi to \r\nRwanda, that case, along with the cases of \r\nKanyarukiga, Hategekimana and Gatete, may now have \r\nto be added to the Tribunal’s workload, making the \r\ntotal for adjudication 38 cases.  \r\n The Appeals Chamber has also continued to \r\nfunction effectively. It has delivered more than 80 \r\ninterlocutory decisions and pretrial orders and \r\ndecisions as well as judgements concerning three \r\nindividuals. That brings the number of persons who \r\nhave had their appeals completed to a total of 25. As a \r\nresult, only one appeal is pending. But I think that the \r\nAssembly should take note that the appellate workload \r\nis likely to increase dramatically in the near future and \r\nthat the capacity of the Appeals Chamber may need to \r\nbe enhanced to cope with it. \r\n During the reporting period, Prosecutor Hassan \r\nJallow and his staff were at full stretch, investigating \r\nand developing evidence for cases not yet in trial, \r\npresenting evidence in the cases before the Trial \r\nChambers and dealing with matters before the Appeals \r\nChamber. Prosecutor Jallow has continued to devote \r\nspecial efforts to securing the arrest of the remaining \r\nfugitives, two of whom were arrested during the \r\nreporting period. His Office continued to work to find \r\ncountries willing to receive cases for referral to \r\nnational jurisdictions. It has been providing assistance \r\nin the two cases that have been successfully \r\ntransferred. Two additional referrals are now pending \r\nbefore the Appeals Chamber, and two others are \r\npending before Trial Chambers. The Office of the \r\nProsecutor has compiled a significant database of \r\nevidentiary material and is continuously assisting \r\nnational jurisdictions in their investigations. \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 4 \r\n \r\n During the present reporting period, the Registry, \r\nheaded by Mr. Adama Dieng, has continued to play a \r\nvital role by providing administrative and legal support \r\nto all the Tribunal’s trials. In my last report, I explained \r\nthat the Tribunal was experiencing difficulty due to the \r\ninability to offer long-term appointments, which has \r\ncontributed to the current high staff turnover. The \r\nRegistry continues its efforts to retain the competent, \r\nknowledgeable and experienced staff members required \r\nfor the successful completion of the Tribunal’s mandate. \r\nTo cushion the impact of the Tribunal’s drawdown plan \r\nand address the exceptional situation that comes with \r\nit, the Tribunal has engaged the support of the \r\nDepartment of Management, especially the Offices of \r\nthe Comptroller and of Human Resources Management, \r\nto explore and adopt flexible, exceptional measures \r\nand a common strategy to address the challenges of \r\ndownsizing and ensure that the Tribunal completes its \r\nwork within the set time frames. However, more needs \r\nto be done in order to address the issue of staff \r\nretention, and we will continue to count on the \r\nAssembly’s support.  \r\n During the reporting period, the Office of the \r\nRegistrar has also continued to deploy vigorous and \r\ncommendable diplomatic efforts in the relocation of \r\nacquitted persons. As a result of — and thanks to — \r\nthe cooperation of Member States, one acquitted \r\nperson has been relocated. Now only one acquitted \r\nperson awaits relocation, and efforts are ongoing to \r\nfind a suitable resolution. \r\n Establishing peace, justice, security and \r\nreconciliation in the region remains a central activity \r\nof the Tribunal. As a key component of its mandate, the \r\nTribunal provides support in Rwanda to the judiciary, \r\nto civil society and to academic institutions through its \r\ncomprehensive capacity-building and outreach \r\nprogrammes. The Registry in particular has continued \r\nto promote the Tribunal’s work by carrying out a \r\ndiverse range of public relations activities, including \r\ntraining sessions and the production of documentaries \r\nand other publications, notably in Rwanda and the \r\nGreat Lakes region. \r\n The Tribunal has worked assiduously in \r\ncompliance with the completion strategy. The task has \r\nbeen daunting, yet we have tackled the challenge with \r\nconfidence and determination. However, there have \r\nbeen developments that added to the workload on \r\nwhich the time estimates were initially based. Because \r\nof the recent arrests of the three fugitives who have to \r\nbe tried at the Tribunal, we are now planning trials for \r\nwhich provision had not previously been made. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to call again on Member \r\nStates to take more active steps in apprehending the \r\nremaining fugitives, because the value of our \r\nachievements will be diminished unless all those \r\narrests are secured. The inevitable result of those \r\nadditional undertakings is the need for additional time \r\nto complete the proceedings.  \r\n At the request of the Tribunal, following its \r\npresentation of evidence on the progress of its work \r\nand projections, the Security Council extended the \r\nterms of office of some judges in July 2008. The \r\nAssembly will have to decide on the proposed \r\nadditional resources in support of the revised judicial \r\nworkload. \r\n The Tribunal has set for itself a very high \r\nstandard of performance. The workload for which we \r\nare planning is far higher than at any other time in its \r\nhistory. If one uses the number of judgements delivered \r\nas a measurement standard, then within the next 14 \r\nmonths the Tribunal will produce a quantum of work \r\nalmost equivalent to, and maybe exceeding, the \r\nquantum of work produced over the previous 14 years. \r\nSince 1998, 31 trial judgements involving 37 accused \r\nhave been rendered. We are now planning to deliver \r\njudgements in respect of 34 accused in the next 14 \r\nmonths. The Tribunal must now consider adding to its \r\nworkload one case the referral of which has not been \r\nsuccessful, and potentially three other cases the \r\nrequests for referral of which are pending before the \r\nAppeals Chamber, which concern the same national \r\njurisdiction.  \r\n It is true that many of those judgements will be \r\ndelivered after trials that have taken several years to \r\ncomplete. But the upcoming challenge for the judges \r\nand support staff is that the multi-track system devised \r\nto expedite the process requires that trial and \r\njudgement writing activities in every Trial Chamber \r\noverlap during the coming period. That is no easy task. \r\n A workload of such magnitude over a short \r\nperiod will require the continued service of a staff \r\nwhose experience, competence and dedication were \r\nessential to the achievements of which the Tribunal \r\nboasts. Unfortunately, our very success in moving \r\ntowards the timely completion of our tasks leads to the \r\nlack of staff whose services are indispensable to \r\ncontinued progress. Unless we can provide our staff \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n5 08-54686 \r\n \r\nwith reasonable expectations of secure employment, \r\nwe will deprive ourselves of the means to achieve the \r\ngoals and the timetable to which we are committed.  \r\n For some time, the Tribunal has been discussing \r\nthe importance of devising strategies for staff retention \r\nwith this Assembly. Now the situation is even more \r\ncritical than before. A continued loss of staff will make \r\nthe task insurmountable. When it became apparent that \r\nthere would be no financial incentives for staff \r\nretention, the Tribunal adopted a number of alternate \r\nstrategies. But at present, the most important \r\nrequirement for the retention of staff is predictability \r\nof employment until the completion of our work, and \r\nthat is within the power of this Assembly to guarantee.  \r\n We have applied for a supplementary budget to \r\nretain the staff required for the trials planned for 2009. \r\nRapid adoption of the supplementary budget will \r\nprovide the required predictability for our staff \r\nmembers and allow the Tribunal to move effectively \r\nand expeditiously towards a successful implementation \r\nof its completion strategy. Without that approval, \r\ncomprehensive and efficient planning will be impossible.  \r\n I should point out that the need for a \r\nsupplementary budget does not reflect any inefficiency \r\non the part of the Tribunal. It reflects, rather, the fact \r\nthat this Tribunal, and others like it, are in many ways \r\nunprecedented in the history of international \r\njurisprudence. While it was obvious at the outset that \r\nfunding would have to be provided for its operation, it \r\nmay not have been so obvious that any Tribunal \r\ndesigned to exist for a limited time would require \r\nbudgetary adjustments as it approached the conclusion \r\nof its mandate. I stand before the Assembly to reiterate \r\nthat the Tribunal remains committed to its important \r\nmandate to bring to justice those most responsible for \r\nthe mass atrocity in Rwanda during 1994, to restore \r\npeace to the Great Lakes region and to facilitate \r\nreconciliation between the former combatants. \r\n Finally, it would be remiss of me not to recall that \r\nthe Tribunal is actively preparing for the period after \r\nthe completion of its current trial work. Discussions \r\nand exchanges of views are under way with the Office \r\nof Legal Affairs and other stakeholders to determine \r\nthe residual functions needed to preserve the Tribunal’s \r\nlegacy, including such important issues as the \r\nenforcement of sentences, the protection of witnesses \r\nand the maintenance of archives in which so much \r\nhistory is reposed. \r\n I would now like to thank the General Assembly \r\nfor its unfailing support to the Tribunal, which is \r\nparamount to the successful accomplishment of our \r\nvital mission. Approximately 14 years ago the \r\ninternational community determined that international \r\njustice was an essential component of reconciliation \r\nand peace. We think the Member States were right. We \r\nmust ensure that the next generations will never forget \r\nour accomplishments and will pursue the fight against \r\nimpunity of those who commit the most serious \r\ninternational crimes. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda. \r\n I now call on Mr. Fausto Pocar, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. \r\n Mr. Pocar (spoke in Spanish): I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, upon \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly. It \r\nis a great honour for me to take the floor under your \r\npresidency for the third time as President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \r\nand to present the fifteenth annual report of the \r\nTribunal (see A/63/210). I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to convey my warmest gratitude to the \r\nmembers of the Assembly for their support of the \r\nTribunal over the years, which is essential to enable the \r\nTribunal to complete its work. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n In my address today, I would like to outline the \r\nTribunal’s remarkable work and to highlight the \r\nsignificance of its legacy for the future of international \r\ncriminal justice. Since 2004, the effectiveness of the \r\nTribunal has been measured primarily by the yardstick \r\nof the targets established in the framework of the \r\ncompletion strategy endorsed by the Security Council \r\nin resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004). However, \r\nthe completion of the cases on our docket is only part \r\nof our mission. Our main goal is to ensure that the \r\npioneering role and substantial accomplishments of the \r\nTribunal will continue to inspire future generations in \r\ntheir fight for justice. In other words, the fight against \r\nimpunity must remain a priority for the international \r\ncommunity, and towards that end the international \r\ncommunity must continue to support judges, prosecutors \r\nand human rights defenders, in particular in the \r\ncountries of the former Yugoslavia, in order to \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 6 \r\n \r\nstrengthen the rule of law by bringing to justice those \r\nresponsible for international crimes. \r\n The Tribunal has been a resounding success in \r\nmany respects. It has brought charges against 161 \r\nindividuals and completed proceedings against 116 of \r\nthem. It has created nearly two thirds of the entire body \r\nof international case law dealing with violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. It has continuously \r\nstrived to improve its procedures and working methods \r\nand has achieved unparalleled productivity. It has \r\ncontributed to the exceptional development and \r\nunprecedented strengthening of international criminal \r\nand humanitarian law. And more importantly, it has \r\nbrought justice to victims, helped build peace and \r\npromoted reconciliation by supporting judicial \r\ninstitutions responsible for pursuing and trying war \r\ncriminals in the former Yugoslavia. \r\n However, in order to preserve the Tribunal’s \r\nachievements and to enable it to fulfil its mission, the \r\ninternational community must keep up its support in \r\nseveral areas. First, the Tribunal must be provided with \r\nall necessary means to complete its proceedings fairly \r\nand expeditiously. Secondly, the remaining fugitives must \r\nbe arrested, and thirdly, more substantial assistance must \r\nbe provided to our partners in the former Yugoslavia. \r\n With regard, first, to the completion of trials, \r\nover the past year we have greatly improved efficiency \r\nand made unprecedented progress. At present, of the 43 \r\nremaining accused individuals — excluding the 2 who \r\nare still fugitives — 22 are currently on trial, 6 are \r\nawaiting judgement, 10 are on appeal, and only 5 — \r\nincluding 4 who were recently arrested — are awaiting \r\ntheir trials, which will begin shortly.  \r\n During the reporting period, the Trial Chambers \r\nrendered 213 decisions on pretrial matters in 8 cases, \r\ndelivered 5 judgements and heard 5 contempt cases. \r\nSince October 2007, the Appeals Chamber has rendered \r\n169 decisions comprising 10 appeals from judgements, \r\n43 interlocutory appeals, 90 pre-appeal decisions and \r\n26 review, reconsideration or other decisions. \r\n Those results are the fruit of our steady efforts to \r\nidentify new concrete measures that would enable us to \r\nstreamline our work. For that purpose, in April I \r\ndecided to reconstitute the working groups tasked with \r\nspeeding up trials and appeals.  \r\n The Trial Chambers have been able to conduct \r\nsimultaneous proceedings in eight cases, thanks to the \r\nvery effective management of three courtrooms, with \r\nall of the empty time slots being used, but also thanks \r\nto the appointment of ad litem judges to two or even \r\nthree cases under way.  \r\n As I have already underscored, the contribution \r\nmade by the ad litem judges remains essential for the \r\nTribunal to complete the cases. To that end, I took the \r\ninitiative of recommending to the Security Council that \r\nit adopt a resolution authorizing the appointment of \r\nadditional ad litem judges, who already number more \r\nthan the limit set by the statute, which is 12. \r\nResolution 1800 (2008), which was adopted in \r\nFebruary, allowed us to appoint two additional ad litem \r\njudges and commence two new trials. \r\n I also wish to draw the attention of the Assembly \r\ntoday to two other issues that are critical to the \r\ncompletion of the cases on our docket. The first, which \r\nI addressed before the General Assembly last year, \r\nconcerns the pension entitlements of permanent judges. \r\nI wish to point out that the conclusions of a study \r\nconducted by an independent consulting firm, which \r\nwere endorsed by the Secretariat, confirm our claim \r\nthat the disparity between the pension benefits of \r\njudges of the Tribunal and those of judges of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is discriminatory and \r\nclearly contrary to the Tribunal’s Statute. It is \r\nimperative that that issue, which will have direct \r\nconsequences for the completion of the trials, be \r\nswiftly resolved.  \r\n Thus, we need the Assembly’s unwavering \r\nsupport at this stage. There is no doubt that, if the \r\nTribunal’s judges do not receive the same benefits as \r\nthe Court’s judges, some of them will be obliged to \r\nresign in order to return their countries’ jurisdictions \r\nand secure their pension entitlements. We would then \r\nlose the valuable contributions of experienced judges at \r\na critical time in the Tribunal’s mandate, when our \r\nobjectives demand maximum efficiency. I therefore \r\nurge the General Assembly to address this matter as \r\nsoon as possible by adopting the recommendations set \r\nout in the consulting firm’s study and those of the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n Another issue that has arisen is the retention of \r\nhighly qualified staff. As the Tribunal’s work nears \r\ncompletion, staff members will have to seek new career \r\nopportunities, and many are already doing so. We must \r\nensure that our staff members, who have dedicated \r\nmany years of service to the institution, benefit from \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n7 08-54686 \r\n \r\ntraining and career counselling and that measures are \r\nadopted to enhance their career prospects as the \r\nTribunal completes its work. Such measures are \r\nessential so that we can manage departures of staff and \r\nretain key personnel without whom the Tribunal will \r\nnot be able to complete its work on time.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Let me now turn to the second point for which \r\nMember State support is essential: the arrest of the \r\nremaining fugitives. As Members are well aware, \r\npositive developments have taken place during the \r\nreporting period. The arrests of Stojan Župljanin and \r\nRadovan Karadžić were particularly important \r\nmilestones, and we commend the Government of \r\nSerbia for the critical cooperation it provided in that \r\nrespect. However, we cannot successfully accomplish \r\nour work if the last two remaining fugitives, Ratko \r\nMladić and Goran Hadžić, are not arrested \r\nimmediately. I must emphasize once again that, while \r\nthe Tribunal has done its utmost to expeditiously \r\nconduct and complete its cases, the late arrests of \r\nfugitives — for which the international community must \r\ntake responsibility — will inevitably lead to slippages \r\nin the scheduled end of our proceedings. Thus, while \r\nwe are ensuring that the trials of the four recently \r\narrested accused will all start in 2009, the arrests of the \r\nremaining fugitives might oblige us to push back even \r\nfurther our target dates for the completion of all trials. \r\n I also wish to reiterate that the obligation of all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to cooperate \r\nwith the Tribunal, pursuant to article 29 of the Statute, \r\nis not limited to the arrest of fugitives. That obligation \r\nis, in fact, much wider and also entails the provision of \r\nassistance in all aspects of the ongoing proceedings \r\nbefore the Tribunal, including access to archives, the \r\nproduction of documents and access to and the \r\nprotection of witnesses. I must note, in that respect, \r\ndisturbing incidents of witness interference that have \r\noccurred during the reporting period, as well as delays \r\nin the service of documents, which have affected the \r\nexpeditious conduct of our proceedings.  \r\n Finally, State cooperation also entails cooperation \r\nin the relocation of witnesses and the enforcement of \r\nthe Tribunal’s sentences. While the Registry has \r\nmanaged to finalize seven agreements on the \r\nenforcement of sentences, further support from States \r\nis required with respect to the relocation of witnesses. \r\n The third and final point that I would like to raise \r\nwith members today is, to my mind, equally important. \r\nIt concerns the legacy that we will leave for \r\ninternational and domestic courts in the conduct of \r\ncomplex criminal cases dealing with serious violations \r\nof international humanitarian law and, in particular, the \r\ncontinuation of our mission by judicial institutions in \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. \r\n Allow me to recall, in that respect, that the \r\nTribunal was never intended to serve indefinitely as a \r\nsubstitute for national courts, in particular in the region \r\nof the former Yugoslavia. Those domestic courts have \r\nan essential role to play in ensuring that justice is \r\nserved and in promoting reconciliation. Thus, our \r\nstrategy for the future must not only include the \r\ncompletion of the cases on our docket; as I said earlier, \r\nwe must also strive to secure the continuation by local \r\nactors of our mission to fight impunity. In other words, \r\nwe will satisfactorily fulfil our mandate only if \r\ndomestic judicial institutions are ready to take on the \r\ntask that we will leave behind.  \r\n That strategy also makes sense in the context of a \r\nmore prosaic, cost-benefit analysis: a failure to \r\nadequately support domestic rule-of-law institutions \r\nwill, in effect, diminish the impact of Member States’ \r\nsignificant financial investments in international justice \r\nmade through their contributions to the Tribunal \r\nbudget. The capital invested thus far will not yield the \r\nexpected return if the international community does not \r\ncontinue to support our legacy projects. \r\n As detailed in my report, during the reporting \r\nperiod we have taken and supported multiple initiatives \r\nto strengthen our partnership with domestic judicial \r\ninstitutions and to establish close communication \r\nchannels with our interlocutors in the region. \r\nFollowing the amendments in July 2007 and February \r\n2008 of rule 75 (H) of the Tribunal’s Rules of \r\nProcedure and Evidence — which allows parties, \r\njudges, victims and witnesses to directly petition the \r\nTribunal for variation of protective measures ordered \r\nby the Tribunal — we have handled a large number of \r\napplications from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and \r\nSerbia. To ensure expeditious processing, I established \r\na special bench to deal with some of those applications. \r\n In previous reports, I have emphasized the \r\nTribunal’s referral of the cases of 13 mid- to low-level \r\naccused to domestic jurisdictions in the region, \r\npursuant to rule 11 bis of our Rules of Procedure and \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 8 \r\n \r\nEvidence. The referral procedure has been very \r\nsuccessful so far, and the trials of the individuals who \r\nhave been transferred are being closely monitored by \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope on behalf of the Office of the Prosecutor.  \r\n However, one must not forget that, in addition to \r\nthe cases referred by the Tribunal, thousands of war \r\ncrimes cases are currently pending or being investigated \r\nby domestic judicial institutions. Therefore, the \r\ncontinuing support of the international community for \r\ndomestic institutions remains absolutely essential to \r\nguaranteeing the lasting establishment of the rule of law.  \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n On the occasion of my visit to Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina in May, I saw for myself the extent of the \r\ntask that remains to be achieved. Cooperation between \r\nStates of the region in the investigation and \r\nprosecution of alleged war criminals, such as the \r\nextradition of nationals who are alleged war criminals \r\nto another jurisdiction, remains problematic. In \r\naddition, there are still dire needs with respect to the \r\nsecurity of detention facilities, in particular in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. That was unfortunately highlighted \r\nby the escape from prison of Radovan Stankovic, \r\nwhose case was referred by the Tribunal to Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina under rule 11 bis. The escape happened \r\nless than two months after Stankovic was convicted of \r\nsystematic rape, torture and enslavement of women and \r\nunderage girls and sentenced to 20 years’ \r\nimprisonment. The fact that, a year and a half later, he \r\nhas not yet been apprehended is regrettable.  \r\n The lack of progress made by the relevant \r\nauthorities in apprehending Stankovic and in \r\nprosecuting those who assisted his escape at all levels \r\nhas been a cause of serious concern for the Tribunal. \r\nWe cannot afford to let the valiant efforts of domestic \r\njudiciaries to strengthen the rule of law be tarnished by \r\nthe inaction of Governments and local authorities. It is \r\nthus essential that the international community continue \r\nto press those authorities to address that failure.  \r\n In that regard as well, I must take this opportunity \r\nto raise the issue of the presence of international staff \r\nin the State Court and Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. During my visit to Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, various actors voiced concern about the \r\nimpending departure of that staff, given that their \r\nmandate is due to terminate at the end of 2009. \r\nVictims’ groups, for instance, have indicated that it will \r\nhave a detrimental impact on the willingness of \r\nwitnesses to testify. I therefore urge the international \r\ncommunity to support an extension of the mandates of \r\nthe international members of the State Court and \r\nProsecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n We have also initiated two joint projects to ensure \r\nthe preservation of the Tribunal’s legacy. One project, \r\nwhich should be completed before the end of the year, \r\nwas undertaken with the assistance of the United \r\nNations Interregional Crime and Justice Research \r\nInstitute and consists of compiling a manual of the \r\nTribunal’s best practices, which will be of great value \r\nto other international and domestic jurisdictions \r\ninvolved in the prosecution of war crimes cases.  \r\n Another project, launched in partnership with the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nOffice for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, \r\ninvolves assessing the impact of capacity-building \r\nefforts and identifying what remains to be done to \r\nensure that local judiciaries have the capacity to \r\ncontinue the work of the Tribunal long after it \r\ncompletes its mandate. \r\n Let me, finally, touch briefly on the ongoing \r\ndiscussions on residual mechanisms. As I previously \r\nreported, we submitted our final report on residual \r\nmechanisms in September 2007. Since then, we have \r\nmet with the Security Council Working Group on the \r\nad hoc Tribunals and provided several clarifications in \r\nresponse to the questions of Working Group members. \r\nWe also welcomed members of the Working Group to \r\nthe Tribunal on 1 and 2 October. That visit gave \r\nmembers the opportunity to meet our judges and senior \r\nstaff and gain a more practical understanding of our \r\nwork, which I am sure will prove helpful when \r\ndetermining the features of the Tribunal’s residual \r\nmechanisms.  \r\n With respect to the specific question of the \r\nTribunal’s archives, we just received a report from the \r\nAdvisory Committee on Archives set up by the \r\nRegistrars of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda, which will soon be considered by \r\nthe Tribunal with a view to submitting its \r\nrecommendations on that question. I must, in that \r\nregard, take the opportunity to emphasize that, \r\nirrespective of the political decision on the physical \r\nlocation of the Tribunal’s archives, it is of critical \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n9 08-54686 \r\n \r\nimportance that open access to the archives be \r\nguaranteed. For that purpose, a suggested approach \r\nwould be the creation of memorial centres in the main \r\ncities of the region, offering access to archives, \r\nhistorical information on the Tribunal’s proceedings \r\nand cases, as well as interactive debates on \r\ninternational criminal justice and reconciliation in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. That would not only meet the \r\nprimary objective of the archives project, which is easy \r\nand open access to our work by the interested public; it \r\nwould also guarantee the seamless continuation of the \r\nlong-standing work and achievements of the Tribunal’s \r\noutreach programme, which are described in my report. \r\n The Tribunal’s achievements would not have \r\nbeen possible without the vital support of the members \r\nof this Assembly. The creation of the Tribunal in 1993 \r\nheralded a new era in international affairs. It led to the \r\nestablishment of many other international criminal \r\njustice institutions, which together work towards a \r\nsingle goal: fighting impunity and bringing justice to \r\nvictims of gross violations of international law. But the \r\nTribunal’s work has also had a deep impact on \r\ndomestic judiciaries, particularly in the former \r\nYugoslavia. Those judges, prosecutors and defence \r\nlawyers are the actors that will most fundamentally \r\ncontribute to the lasting development of the rule of law \r\nin the region, which, 15 years ago, was still the scene \r\nof one of the most brutal conflicts of the twentieth \r\ncentury. Once the Tribunal completes its cases, those \r\nare the people whom the international community must \r\ncontinue to support if it truly wants to guarantee long-\r\nterm peace and prosperity in that part of the world.  \r\n I call upon all Member States to assist us in our \r\ncommitment to seeing the work of the Tribunal \r\nsuccessfully through to the end and to provide support \r\nto those institutions in the former Yugoslavia which \r\nwill carry on our mission to fight impunity. \r\n Mr. Ripert (France) (spoke in French): I have the \r\nhonour of speaking on behalf of the European Union \r\n(EU). The candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the country \r\nof the Stabilisation and Association Process and \r\npotential candidate Albania; and the European Free \r\nTrade Association countries Iceland and Liechtenstein, \r\nmembers of the European Economic Area; as well as \r\nUkraine and the Republic of Moldova align themselves \r\nwith this statement. \r\n This year once again, the European Union intends \r\nto reaffirm its constant and unwavering support for the \r\nwork of the International Criminal Tribunals for \r\nRwanda (ICTR) and the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), as \r\ncorrectly recalled by their respective Presidents, \r\nMr. Byron and Mr. Pocar. The EU thanks them both for \r\ntheir excellent reports (A/63/209 and A/63/210) and \r\nwelcomes their efforts successfully to complete the \r\nwork of the two Tribunals in accordance with the \r\ncompletion strategy specified by the Security Council. \r\n It is still too early to make a final assessment of \r\nthe work of the Tribunals, whose job is not completely \r\nfinished, but we can already underscore their influence \r\nand their achievements. \r\n First, since their establishment, both Tribunals \r\nhave embodied the need to fight impunity and the \r\nrefusal to let the perpetrators of morally outrageous \r\ncrimes escape justice. They were forerunners in \r\ncreating jurisprudence that is a source of inspiration for \r\nall national and international jurisdictions that will \r\nhave to address such crimes. Their record bears that \r\nout. International criminal justice does exist, it prevails \r\nand, sooner or later, the perpetrators will answer to it \r\nfor their heinous crimes. \r\n Secondly, apart from the qualitative aspect, from \r\na quantitative standpoint the work of both Tribunals \r\nhas been impressive. The numbers provided by their \r\nPresidents speak for themselves. If we include the \r\ncases of lesser importance assigned to national \r\njurisdictions, few perpetrators are still at large. The \r\nEuropean Union would like to pay special tribute to the \r\nwork of the Tribunals’ staff — especially judges, \r\nprosecutors and registrars — who have redoubled their \r\nefforts to adhere to the completion strategy. Thanks to \r\nthe additional ad litem judges, the Tribunals should \r\ncomplete the ongoing proceedings within the specified \r\ntime limits. \r\n The arrests last June of Stojan Župljanin and, \r\nafter 13 years at large, of Radovan Karadžić, represent \r\na major breakthrough for the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The EU commends \r\nSerbia’s cooperation, which made that possible. It \r\nrecalls that full cooperation with the ICTY was \r\nessential to the EU stabilization and association \r\nstrategy towards all countries of the region. We now \r\nexpect Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić to be arrested \r\nand, in that regard, count on the continued cooperation \r\nof the States of the region with the Tribunal.  \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 10 \r\n \r\n With regard to the ICTR, the overall record is \r\nalso extremely positive, although we regret that 13 \r\naccused have yet to be brought to justice. The \r\nEuropean Union urges all States to improve their \r\ncooperation with the ICTR and to fulfil their \r\nobligations with respect to the arrest and return of the \r\naccused at large. We call particularly on the Kenyan \r\nGovernment to do its utmost to secure the arrest of \r\nFélicien Kabuga and his surrender to Arusha. \r\n Strengthening the Rwandan legal system to \r\nimprove its ability to judge cases transferred from the \r\nTribunal is also one of the goals of the European \r\nUnion. The EU notes with appreciation the efforts \r\nmade by Rwanda to meet the requirements involved in \r\nguaranteeing the right to a fair trial, and hopes that \r\nthose efforts will allow the ICTR to transfer lower-\r\nranked defendants before the Rwandan courts. Such a \r\ntransfer is an important part of the Tribunal’s \r\ncompletion strategy.  \r\n The Tribunals are approaching the end of their \r\ncompletion strategy. Neither Tribunal was intended to \r\nbe permanent. They will cease to exist when the \r\nSecurity Council deems that the job for which they \r\nwere set up has been accomplished. We look forward to \r\nthat moment, as it will mark the end of the Tribunals’ \r\nmission and confirm their undisputed success. One \r\nthing must, however, be clear: High-level fugitives, \r\nsuch as Mladić, Hadžić and Kabuga, must be judged by \r\nan international tribunal and cannot count on impunity \r\nor on being forgotten. \r\n It is important that the Tribunals be granted \r\nadequate resources to enable them to meet the \r\ncompletion strategy time limits set by the Security \r\nCouncil as regards ongoing proceedings. The EU \r\nacknowledges that the arrests of Župljanin and \r\nKaradžić will most likely lead to those deadlines being \r\nrevised, as their trials cannot be rushed. The same will \r\nbe true for the other high-level fugitives if, as hoped, \r\nthey are caught soon. We also understand that the \r\ntransfer of low-ranking defendants before national \r\njurisdictions is not easy to decide. However, we must \r\nemphasize that the Tribunals must continue to make all \r\nnecessary efforts to complete their work within the \r\nSecurity Council time frames. \r\n The EU is committed to preserving the legacy of \r\nthe Tribunals after their closure. We believe that, if \r\nhigh-ranking fugitives are still at large upon \r\ncompletion of the Tribunals, a mechanism that can \r\nreconstitute the capacity to try them once they are \r\narrested must be set up. Furthermore, we are \r\ndetermined that such a mechanism, which must be \r\nstreamlined, efficient and economical, should allow for \r\nthe management of residual functions, which must be \r\nmaintained for the purposes of administrating justice in \r\nconditions of fairness and security. Finally, we believe \r\nthat the United Nations should maintain ownership and \r\ncontrol over the Tribunals’ records. \r\n In general, the EU believes that it is the duty of \r\nthe United Nations to guarantee the integrity and \r\ncontinuity of the Tribunals’ legacy. The completion of \r\ntheir work should in no way signal an end to their \r\nmission of spreading international justice and the \r\nprinciples that led to their creation: the rejection of \r\nimpunity and the will for justice to be served. \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of Canada, Australia and my own \r\ncountry, New Zealand — the CANZ delegations. At the \r\noutset, Canada, Australia and New Zealand wish to \r\nreaffirm their strong support for the International \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). \r\nBoth Tribunals have made and continue to make a \r\nsignificant contribution towards fulfilling our shared \r\ngoal of ending impunity for genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes. \r\n The jurisprudence of both Tribunals forms part of \r\ntheir legacy, and one that other international criminal \r\ntribunals, including the International Criminal Court, \r\nas well as national courts, will continue to draw on for \r\nyears to come. By bringing to justice the perpetrators \r\nof the most shocking crimes, the Tribunals have helped \r\nto strengthen the rule of law and promote long-term \r\nstability and reconciliation in the Balkans and in \r\nRwanda, showing that peace and justice can indeed go \r\nhand in hand. \r\n A key focus for both Tribunals now is the \r\nimplementation of their completion strategies. The \r\narrest of the indictees who are still at large is a crucial \r\ncomponent of those strategies. We note with satisfaction \r\nthat both Tribunals have secured further arrests during \r\nthe course of the year, including, as reported by the \r\nPresident, the transfer of Radovan Karadžić to The \r\nHague. We urge Member States to redouble their \r\nefforts to expedite the arrest and surrender of the \r\nremaining high-level fugitives, notably Ratko Mladić, \r\nGoran Hadžić and ICTR indictee Félicien Kabuga. \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n11 08-54686 \r\n \r\n CANZ is encouraged by the commitment of both \r\nTribunals to implementation of their completion \r\nstrategies. We welcome the ongoing work on residual \r\nissues being done by both the Tribunals themselves and \r\nthe Security Council’s informal working group. We \r\nacknowledge the many and varied challenges those \r\nissues present. We also welcome the increased \r\nefficiency measures for the trial and appeal processes. \r\nAt the same time, CANZ acknowledges the difficult \r\nbalancing act that is required in order to wind down the \r\noperations of the Tribunals while still retaining \r\nsufficient staff capacity to deal with the remaining \r\ncases in a manner that is consistent with due process. \r\n We note the additional workload placed on both \r\nTribunals as a result of the recent arrests. For the \r\nICTR, that has required an adjustment to the projected \r\ntime frame for completion of its trials, with the result \r\nthat the President asked the Security Council for a one-\r\nyear extension. CANZ urges both Tribunals to continue \r\nto identify further reforms that will enable them to \r\ncomplete their work as efficiently and promptly as \r\npossible. \r\n Referral of cases to national jurisdictions is \r\nanother key component of the completion strategies. \r\nCANZ recognizes that there are a number of benefits to \r\nreferring cases to the national jurisdictions where the \r\ncrimes occurred, including the positive contribution \r\ndomestic proceedings can make to national \r\nreconciliation processes. Accordingly, CANZ welcomes \r\nthe referral of the remaining mid- and low-level \r\naccused in the ICTY to the courts of that region. \r\n CANZ also welcomes the steps that Rwanda has \r\ntaken over recent years to strengthen its national \r\njustice system and its capacity to prosecute serious \r\ncrimes, including its abolition of the death penalty. We \r\nencourage Rwanda to continue its efforts and note that, \r\nwhile there has not been a referral to Rwanda yet, we \r\nhope that further progress will enable that in future. \r\n As we approach the end of the mandates for the \r\nTribunals, the international community will have to \r\nreflect on how to address the issue of the prosecution \r\nof those who are subject to outstanding arrest warrants. \r\nThe main options include the referral and transfer to \r\nnational jurisdictions, as well as the extension of the \r\nICTR and ICTY mandates. The view of CANZ is \r\nclear — a strategy needs to be devised to ensure that \r\nimpunity is not an option, as that would undermine the \r\nsignificant gains of the past two decades. Our \r\noverarching concern is to avoid impunity for those \r\ncrimes. \r\n CANZ welcomes the statements of both Presidents \r\non the work that both Tribunals are doing on residual \r\nissues in the context of the completion strategy. A \r\nnumber of those require careful consideration. They \r\ninclude how to deal with the enforcement of sentences, \r\nthe preservation and protection of archives, the \r\nmonitoring of cases referred and issues relating to \r\nprotected and relocated witnesses, as well as to \r\npossible future applications by convicted persons, for \r\nexample, for review of their cases on the basis of \r\nnewly discovered facts. Those issues present practical \r\nchallenges that require the development of principled \r\nbut effective mechanisms. CANZ encourages further \r\ndiscussion among the international community on the \r\npotential benefits of joint approaches to those residual \r\nissues for the ICTR, ICTY and other ad hoc \r\ninternational tribunals. \r\n In closing, the ICTY and ICTR continue to \r\ncontribute significantly to the fight against impunity. \r\nThe successful completion of their work relies on \r\ncooperation and support from all States. We call upon \r\nStates to give practical effect to their commitment to an \r\neffective system of international criminal justice. For \r\nour part, Canada, Australia and New Zealand will \r\ncontinue to offer the Tribunals our full support and \r\ncooperation in the closing but still vital stage of their \r\nexistence. \r\n Mr. Jurica (Croatia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto welcome the Presidents of the International Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), Judge Pocar \r\nand Judge Byron, and thank them for presenting their \r\nrespective reports (A/63/210 and A/63/209). \r\n Fifteen years ago, the international community \r\nestablished those two ad hoc Tribunals with high \r\nexpectations: to help bring about peace and end \r\nimpunity, to bring justice to victims, and to provide a \r\ndeterrent for future crimes. They have demonstrated \r\nthat international criminal justice does exist and that it \r\nis inseparable from the values that the United Nations \r\nstands for. They were the precursors and inspiration for \r\nthe establishment of the first permanent International \r\nCriminal Court. Their jurisprudence created a historical \r\nrecord, reaffirming our belief that there can be no \r\npeace without justice. Individual criminal responsibility \r\nis not an obstacle, but a catalyst to reconciliation. As \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 12 \r\n \r\nthe President of the Republic of Croatia, Stjepan \r\nMesić, has emphasized on many occasions, in order to \r\navoid the notion of the collective guilt of nations, it is \r\nindispensable to establish individual criminal \r\nresponsibility. \r\n As the mandates of the two Tribunals are drawing \r\nto an end and we begin looking into the mechanisms \r\nthat will allow a number of essential residual functions \r\nto continue after the conclusion of the trials, we have \r\nto be careful not to lose sight of the purpose for which \r\nthey were established — to close the impunity gap. \r\nThat is why the international community cannot afford \r\nto declare their mandates complete before every effort \r\nhas been made to bring those most responsible to \r\njustice, however long that takes. \r\n I would like to make a few specific remarks \r\nregarding the ICTY, given the importance my country \r\nattaches to the Tribunal’s work.  \r\n The arrests this year of the fugitives Radovan \r\nKaradžić and Stojan Župljanin are of vital importance \r\nto completing the Tribunal’s exit strategy and \r\naccomplishing the purpose for which the Tribunal was \r\nfounded. We hope to see an early beginning of their \r\ntrials. Without bringing to justice those most senior and \r\nmost responsible for crimes committed in the wars \r\nagainst Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, we \r\ncannot speak of completing the Tribunal’s mandate. \r\nThat is why it is crucial that the remaining fugitives, \r\nRatko Mladić and Goran Hadžić, also face justice. We \r\ncannot accept that their impunity should outlive the \r\nexistence of the Tribunal. Reasons of expediency \r\nshould not be allowed to overshadow the fact that those \r\ntwo individuals, who have evaded justice for many \r\nyears now, held the most prominent military and \r\npolitical positions — Mladić as the Commander of the \r\nGeneral Staff of the Bosnian Serb Army and Hadžić as \r\nso-called President of the so-called self-proclaimed \r\nRepublic of Serbian Krajina in Croatia — and that they \r\nhave been indicted for some of the most atrocious \r\ncrimes committed in post-Second World War Europe, \r\nnamely, the massacres committed in Srebrenica and \r\nVukovar. \r\n Last week, the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed \r\na 35-year sentence for Milan Martic, a former so-called \r\nPresident of the so-called self-proclaimed Republic of \r\nSerbian Krajina in Croatia, who was sentenced for war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated against \r\nthe civilian population in Croatia. \r\n The appeals proceedings with respect to the \r\njudgement rendered a year ago in the case of the so-\r\ncalled Vukovar Three — Radic, Sljivancanin and \r\nMrksic — are still ongoing. Notwithstanding the \r\nunderstandable reactions of the victims’ families and \r\nthe general public in Croatia and elsewhere to the \r\ninitial verdicts in that case, I would like to limit myself \r\nto expressing our hope that the appellate proceedings \r\nwill hand down a just judgement that corresponds to \r\nthe gravity of the crimes committed. \r\n As the Prime Minister of Croatia, Ivo Sanader, \r\nsaid in this Assembly last fall, a year ago,  \r\n “a just outcome of prosecution is the only way to \r\ndiscourage those who might consider repeating \r\nsuch crimes, today or in the future. Just \r\npunishment offers a measure of respect for the \r\nvictims. Just punishment is the best deterrent. \r\nJust punishment also serves truth and opens the \r\nway for lasting peace, security and reconciliation”. \r\n(A/62/PV.25, p. 8) \r\n By the same token, credible justice must not \r\nleave any impunity gaps, and that is why it remains \r\ncrucial that the Tribunal not close its doors before \r\ntrying the remaining fugitives. \r\n The war imposed on Croatia in 1991 has left a \r\nsad legacy of war crimes. The Croatian Government \r\nhas invested serious efforts into prosecuting those \r\ncrimes by adjusting its judicial structure and material \r\nlaws, by continuously consolidating its judicial \r\ncapacities and by strengthening cooperation with \r\nauthorities in the region.  \r\n Croatia’s judiciary has clearly demonstrated its \r\nability to conduct trials in even the most sensitive \r\ncases, including the one case that was transferred to it \r\nby the ICTY. Similarly, Croatia’s judiciary has \r\ndeveloped an excellent working relationship with the \r\nTribunal’s organs, including the Transition Team \r\nwithin the Office of the Prosecutor on so-called \r\nCategory II cases, as well as in ongoing domestic \r\ninvestigations and trials. We find that relationship to be \r\nof vital importance and we are confident that it will \r\ncontinue in the future.  \r\n Croatia is dedicated to and sincere in assisting \r\nand cooperating with the Tribunal to complete its \r\nmandate at an early date. Over the years, we have \r\nprocessed 804 requests for assistance from the Office \r\nof the Prosecutor and delivered tens of thousands of \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n13 08-54686 \r\n \r\ndocuments, over 19,000 of which are from the Ministry \r\nof Defence alone, including those emanating from the \r\nhighest-ranking military officials. \r\n The Government’s commitment to cooperating \r\nfully with the Tribunal remains strong and unequivocal. \r\nI can assure the Assembly that the Croatian authorities \r\nhave and will continue to do everything within their \r\ncompetencies to ensure a prompt response to requests \r\nfrom the Office of the Prosecutor.  \r\n In that regard, let me clarify, with respect to \r\nparagraph 79 of the Tribunal’s annual report (A/63/210), \r\nthat the relevant Croatian authorities continue to work \r\non the pending issue and expect to present the results \r\nshortly to the Tribunal. The Tribunal’s decision of \r\n16 September granted Croatia’s request to continue its \r\ninvestigations in order to establish the existence of the \r\ndocuments sought by the Office of the Prosecutor, the \r\nTrial Chamber not being in a position to draw any \r\nconclusions as to whether such documents do exist. \r\n In discussing the fifteenth annual report of the \r\nICTY, I would like to draw attention to the issue of the \r\nserving of sentences. We find it difficult to justify the \r\ndiscrepancy that exists between the practice of the \r\nICTR and that of the ICTY. Whereas the former \r\nconcluded an agreement on the serving of sentences in \r\nRwanda this year, the ICTY still does not allow for the \r\npossibility that sentences can be served in the country \r\nwhere the crime was committed. While we understand \r\nthat such an approach may have been dictated by the \r\nsecurity considerations prevailing at the time of the \r\ninception of the Tribunal, today, 15 years later, such \r\npractice seems outdated and is adversely affecting the \r\nhumanitarian conditions of the sentenced persons and \r\ntheir families. I would like to repeat that my \r\nGovernment is ready to permit its citizens to serve \r\ntheir sentences in Croatia. \r\n Ms. Juul (Norway): Let me start by expressing \r\nNorway’s continuing support for and full recognition \r\nof the achievements and high standards of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), as reflected in the \r\nTribunals’ well reasoned judgements and the annual \r\nreports before us (A/63/209 and A/63/210). We would \r\nlike to thank the Presidents of the two Tribunals, \r\nJudges Byron and Pocar, for their detailed and \r\ninformative reports, which reflect the progress made \r\nduring the period under review. \r\n The work of the Tribunals has been crucial in \r\nadvancing the cause of justice in Rwanda and the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. Moreover, the Tribunals will leave \r\na legacy of international jurisprudence that can guide \r\nfuture courts and deter the future commission of those \r\ngrave crimes, as well as prevent impunity for potential \r\nperpetrators. As such, they are contributing to the \r\ndevelopment of international criminal justice and the \r\nfight against impunity for mass atrocities in general.  \r\n We commend both Tribunals for their commitment \r\nto adhering to the completion strategies, while ensuring \r\nthat due process standards and fundamental legal \r\nprinciples are fully respected. The Rwanda Tribunal \r\nreport (A/63/209) stresses that the success of the \r\ncompletion strategy will continue to depend on the \r\nsupport and cooperation of States. We fully agree and \r\nwe appeal to all States to demonstrate their full \r\ncooperation with both Tribunals. As the work of the \r\nTribunals is nearing completion, it is crucial that States \r\ngive it their unreserved support.  \r\n We welcome the recent decisions of the Security \r\nCouncil to extend the terms of office of permanent and \r\nad litem judges in order to enhance the effectiveness of \r\ntrial proceedings and to contribute towards the \r\nimplementation of the completion strategies. \r\n It is of the utmost importance that all States \r\nhonour their financial commitments and pay their \r\nassessed contributions on time. Furthermore, Member \r\nStates must fulfil their obligation to arrest and transfer \r\nfugitives to the Tribunals without delay. We compliment \r\nthe Prosecutors on their efforts to secure the arrest of \r\nremaining fugitives and we urge the involved States to \r\ncooperate fully with the Tribunals. We welcome the \r\narrests of high-level accused during the period under \r\nreview. \r\n In particular, we welcome the arrest and transfer \r\nto the ICTY of Radovan Karadžić. That is important \r\nfor the victims of the crimes and it will help to heal the \r\nwounds of the war in the Balkans. Radovan Karadžić’s \r\narrest and transfer to the ICTY are indeed a victory for \r\ninternational law, an important contribution to furthering \r\njustice, and a big step towards addressing the question \r\nof accountability for some of the worst atrocities \r\ncommitted in Europe since the Second World War, not \r\nleast the Srebrenica massacre. \r\n While noting the successes of both Tribunals, it is \r\nimportant to reiterate that the main mission of the \r\nTribunals will not be fulfilled unless the highest-\r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 14 \r\n \r\nranking remaining indictees are brought to justice. It is \r\nnot acceptable that perpetrators of serious international \r\ncrimes are evading legal proceedings. The failure to \r\narrest the remaining fugitives continues to be of \r\nconcern to us. \r\n Norway has entered into an agreement with the \r\nICTY regarding the enforcement of sentences and \r\ncooperates closely with the Rwanda Tribunal in several \r\nfields. There is an urgent need for more States to enter \r\ninto agreements regarding the enforcement of \r\nsentences. It is unreasonable that only a few Member \r\nStates should shoulder that important responsibility. \r\nWe therefore commend the conclusion of new \r\nagreements by the ICTY, as mentioned in the report, \r\nand look forward to more agreements being concluded. \r\n We strongly support the Tribunals’ external \r\nactivities and their involvement and cooperation with \r\nlocal judiciaries. As noted in the ICTY report, an active \r\nengagement with local judiciaries will help to ensure \r\nthat local courts have the capacity to continue the \r\nTribunal’s work in the future, thereby ensuring the \r\npreservation of its legacy through the prosecution of \r\nwar crimes cases by domestic courts. \r\n Another important aspect we would like to \r\nhighlight is the work being done through outreach \r\nactivities. The report of the Rwanda Tribunal gives a \r\ndetailed account of such activities, which we regard as \r\nan invaluable part of the Tribunal’s work. \r\n All States must honour their international \r\nobligation to cooperate with requests for full and \r\neffective assistance to the Tribunals. That applies with \r\nregard to witnesses, financial and material support and \r\npractical assistance in the enforcement of sentences. \r\nAll States should demonstrate their commitment to the \r\nTribunals by means of resolute and concrete action. \r\n Norway will stand by our long-term commitment \r\nto the successful completion of the mandates assigned \r\nto the two Tribunals by the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Jevremović (Serbia): Before I proceed, I \r\nwould like to express my appreciation and gratitude to \r\nMr. Fausto Pocar, President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), \r\nfor presenting the fifteenth annual report of the \r\nTribunal (A/63/210) to the General Assembly. \r\n The Republic of Serbia is fully committed to \r\nhonouring its international obligations and, during the \r\nreporting period, continued to provide adequate \r\nresponses in several areas of cooperation. In May 2008, \r\nthe Government adopted a framework for future \r\ncooperation with the ICTY and, in compliance with its \r\nprovisions, two of the most wanted remaining \r\nfugitives, Stojan Župljanin and Radovan Karadžić, \r\nwere arrested by Serbian authorities and transferred to \r\nthe detention unit of the Tribunal in June and July \r\n2008, respectively. The National Security Council of \r\nSerbia, the Action Team in charge of tracking fugitives \r\nand the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor played a \r\ncentral role in the arrests, as stated in the report. \r\n Furthermore, during the reporting period, Serbia \r\nonce again demonstrated its capacity to take action at \r\ncritical moments. It also cooperated by granting \r\nwaivers to all persons requested by the Tribunal and \r\nprovided thousands of documents from the archives — \r\nincluding classified documents — related to ongoing \r\ncases. At the same time, exchanges of visits by top \r\nofficials between Belgrade and The Hague have \r\nbecome a regular practice. It is also important to point \r\nout that persons who took part in the sheltering of \r\nfugitives have been identified and prosecuted by the \r\nSerbian authorities. Those are considerable achievements, \r\naccomplished through much hard work and dedication. \r\n The new Government of Serbia is fully \r\ndetermined to honour its commitment to bring to \r\njustice all indicted individuals by transferring them to \r\nthe Tribunal and trying them in domestic courts. In that \r\ncontext, my country also recognizes the efforts of the \r\nnew Prosecutor, Mr. Serge Brammertz, appointed in \r\nJanuary 2008, in securing the arrests of the remaining \r\nfugitives in close cooperation with Serbian authorities. \r\nThe Action Team of Serbia continues to the maximum \r\nto carry out its operations to track down the fugitives, \r\nwhich gives us every reason to believe that Ratko \r\nMladić and Goran Hadžić, the two remaining indictees, \r\ncannot continue to hide forever and that they will soon \r\nbe apprehended and transferred to the Tribunal. \r\n Successful completion of its cooperation with the \r\nTribunal is one of the most important objectives of the \r\nnew Serbian Government. After all, it is in the interest \r\nof the people of Serbia to complete that cooperation \r\nswiftly and effectively. Serbia supports the completion \r\nstrategy of the ICTY, defined in Security Council \r\nresolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004). We believe \r\nthat the basic precondition for the success of the \r\nstrategy is the capacity of domestic courts to process \r\nthe cases transferred to them by the ICTY in \r\naccordance with international legal standards. It is only \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n15 08-54686 \r\n \r\nthrough joint cooperation that we shall be able to carry \r\nthrough the completion strategy by 2010. In that \r\nregard, I would like to point out that the issues related \r\nto residual mechanisms are very important and complex \r\nand that they require in-depth discussion by experts \r\nwithin the relevant bodies of the General Assembly. \r\n However, problems and challenges remain. If we \r\nare to overcome them, satisfy justice and uphold the \r\nrule of law, we must address the crucially important \r\nissue of witness protection. Serbia has done its best to \r\nprotect witnesses and has acted on each of the requests \r\nof the Office of the Prosecutor. Accordingly, the \r\nSerbian War Crimes Prosecutor has facilitated the \r\ntestimony of witnesses and has, on several occasions, \r\nprotected those who had received threats. The report \r\nconcludes that interference with witnesses, particularly \r\nin the form of witness intimidation and their growing \r\nfailure to appear voluntarily to testify, remains a grave \r\nconcern. My country is also seriously concerned by the \r\ninability — or even flat refusal — of some countries \r\nand organizations to provide witness protection and \r\nprevent the disappearance of potential witnesses. We \r\ntherefore call for international cooperation to redress \r\nthe situation, even at this late stage. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express my hope \r\nthat cooperation between the countries concerned and \r\nthe Tribunal will continue and conclude successfully, \r\nto the benefit of overall regional reconciliation. \r\n Mr. Muchemi (Kenya): I wish to express my \r\nappreciation to you, Mr. President, for the able manner \r\nin which you continue to guide the deliberations of the \r\nAssembly. \r\n At the outset, I wish to thank the Presidents of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nand the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) for their comprehensive annual \r\nreports, submitted to the Assembly in conformity with \r\nthe respective Statutes establishing the Tribunals. \r\n My delegation appreciates the work of both \r\nPresidents and the competent manner in which they \r\nhave continued to manage the affairs of the Tribunals. \r\nWe note the progress of their work in the cases already \r\nhandled and express optimism regarding the conclusion \r\nof the pending cases. We are grateful for the extension \r\nof the Tribunals’ mandates for a further period of one \r\nyear to enable them to complete their work in a proper \r\nmanner. We note that achieving a sustainable and long-\r\nterm mechanism for addressing, inter alia, the transfer \r\nand trial of remaining Tribunal cases, the pursuit of \r\nfugitives, the monitoring of sentences and the \r\nmanagement of archives is a challenge to be overcome.  \r\n Kenya strongly supports the international criminal \r\njustice system. We recognize that Tribunals must \r\nprovide and protect the proper administration of justice \r\nby prosecuting those who promote impunity. Similarly, \r\nthe cooperation of Member States is critical if the \r\ncourts are to succeed in restoring justice, securing \r\npeace and preventing the possibility of future mass \r\natrocities. Kenya is prepared to do its part. \r\n Permit me to express my delegation’s views \r\nregarding a matter that was reported to the Security \r\nCouncil in June 2008 concerning a fugitive who is \r\nwanted by the ICTR for prosecution. The Prosecutor of \r\nthe ICTR, Mr. Hassan Jallow, drew attention to the \r\ncase of Félicien Kabuga, who, among other indictees, \r\nhas not been apprehended to face justice. In his \r\nstatement, Mr. Jallow alleged that there had been \r\nseveral reported sightings of the fugitive in the \r\nterritory of Kenya, thereby alluding to his presence in \r\nmy country. Those remarks are of grave concern to my \r\ndelegation. \r\n In that regard, I listened carefully to the statement \r\nby the representative of France on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union and wish to reassure the Assembly of \r\nthe unwavering commitment of my Government to \r\ncooperate with the Tribunal in all respects. \r\n I would like to reiterate that, in the Kabuga case, \r\nmy Government has fully cooperated with the ICTR \r\nofficials, as called for by the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil, in trying to trace Mr. Kabuga for the purpose \r\nof bringing him to justice. For the past three years, the \r\nGovernment of Kenya has been engaged with the \r\nProsecutor’s Office, largely through the Joint Kenya-\r\nICTR Task Force. Further, in demonstrating our \r\ncommitment to the cause of the Tribunal, in May 2008 \r\nthe Government obtained an order from the High Court \r\nof Kenya freezing property belonging to the estate of \r\nMr. Kabuga. That case is still pending before our \r\ncourts in Kenya. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to assure you, Sir, of my \r\ndelegation’s continued commitment to the high ideals \r\nof international criminal justice and the eradication of \r\nimpunity. Kenya will continue to implement the \r\nrecommendations of the Joint Kenya-ICTR Task Force. \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 16 \r\n \r\n Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda): My delegation \r\nwishes to thank you, Sir, for this opportunity to address \r\nthe General Assembly on the important issue of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). \r\nMy delegation also expresses its thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General for his report and to Justice Byron \r\nfor his presentation (A/63/209). \r\n The crimes falling under the ICTR’s mandate \r\nwere committed in Rwanda, mostly by Rwandans and \r\nagainst fellow Rwandans. That makes Rwanda the \r\nmost responsible and concerned State in the pursuit of \r\njustice for those crimes. In that regard, Rwanda finds it \r\nimperative that it participate fully in the determination \r\nof matters pertaining to the Tribunal, particularly the \r\ncompletion process. We have continued to improve our \r\ninstitutional mechanisms for cooperation with the \r\nTribunal to keep pace with the completion process and \r\nthe associated cooperation challenges. We are happy to \r\ninform the Assembly that, to date, we have been able to \r\nhandle all requests made by the various organs of the \r\nTribunal. \r\n In resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1504 (2003), the \r\nSecurity Council directed the two Tribunals to wind up \r\ntheir activities within specified deadlines. Resolution \r\n1503 (2003) further directed that the middle- and low-\r\nranking cases be transferred to national jurisdictions, \r\nincluding Rwanda. As a matter of State responsibility, \r\nRwanda began close consultations with the Tribunal \r\nand set the ground for receiving and conducting the \r\ntrials of some of the cases that may be transferred from \r\nthe ICTR. \r\n A comprehensive piece of legislation was passed \r\nin March 2006 to govern the transfer of cases from the \r\nICTR or any other State to Rwanda. The law provides \r\nsufficient guarantees for a fair trial. It was specifically \r\ndrawn up on the Tribunal’s rules of procedure and \r\nevidence, as well as other best practices recognized and \r\napplied by the Tribunal. The law allows the Tribunal to \r\nmonitor trials and recognizes the Tribunal’s primacy \r\nand right to recall the transferred case. \r\n Modern court rooms have been prepared. For the \r\npast two years, a joint programme has been running \r\nbetween the ICTR and Rwanda, under which we have \r\nconducted familiarization and interaction visits \r\nbetween the Tribunal and Rwanda, together with \r\nworkshops for judges, the prosecution, the bar and \r\nstaff. A modern holding cell has been constructed in \r\nKigali to accommodate ICTR detainees who would be \r\nappearing in court. \r\n In the same way, an agreement for the transfer of \r\nthose convicted by the Tribunal to Rwanda was signed \r\non 4 March 2008. The agreement is founded on the \r\nrequirement provided for under the ICTR statute to \r\nhave sentences served in Rwanda. We have a modern \r\ncorrectional facility that is intended to accommodate \r\nthose from Arusha who have been convicted by the \r\nICTR, as well as those accused by the ICTR who may \r\nstill be convicted. \r\n Both the Prosecutor and the Tribunal’s Registrar \r\nhave conducted a series of visits to Rwanda to verify \r\nRwanda’s readiness and willingness to receive the \r\noutstanding workload from the ICTR. They have \r\nexpressed their satisfaction with the level of \r\ncompliance with the internationally recognized \r\nstandards and norms attained by Rwanda’s judicial \r\ninstitutions. \r\n We were able to make all those preparations with \r\nthe support of numerous members of the international \r\ncommunity. That results from the fact that Rwanda has \r\na shared interest with the Security Council in ensuring \r\na smooth process of winding up the ICTR. \r\n The fugitives still at large are not limited to the \r\n13 appearing on the Tribunal’s list. We have repeatedly \r\nappealed to the Security Council to see that the \r\nconclusion of the ICTR mandate does not become an \r\namnesty to those not included on the Tribunal’s \r\ncondensed list. My Government appreciates the efforts \r\nof some Governments that have apprehended some of \r\nthe fugitives. The proceedings for their extradition to \r\nRwanda are under way, which is largely a result of the \r\njudicial sector reforms and capacity development \r\nevident in Rwanda, as previously stated. \r\n Rwanda’s commitment to comply with international \r\nstandards of fair trial and judicial independence is \r\nunquestionable, as it is central to my Government’s \r\npolicy, founded on our continued fight against \r\nimpunity. We have registered significant progress in \r\nthat important aspect. The progress registered meets \r\nthe requirements inherent in the Tribunal’s completion \r\nprocess. Since May 2007, the ICTR Prosecutor has \r\nfiled five requests for transfer of cases to Rwanda for \r\ntrial. The five referral applications have been processed, \r\nand many of them were denied referral to Rwanda. \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n17 08-54686 \r\n \r\n In spite of these efforts, my country is seriously \r\nconcerned about the direction that the issue of the \r\nreferral of cases is taking. We are particularly \r\nconcerned that this process has the potential to \r\nundermine the trust and reputation we have \r\npainstakingly built. It is this trust and confidence that \r\nhas led certain Governments to apprehend some of the \r\nfugitives found in their respective territories. \r\n Our achievements in judicial reform are not \r\nintangible; they are very visible. Our participation in \r\nthe completion process is in response to a call; it is not \r\na public relations exercise. We must be judged on the \r\nbasis of our conduct and our policies, not on the basis \r\nof presumed future misconduct. We expect and hope to \r\ninherit from the ICTR a legacy that complements our \r\nefforts. What we are looking for is a legacy that \r\nsupports the growth of our institutions. \r\n In 1999, Rwanda protested conduct of the Court \r\nin the case of Barayagwiza, who was eventually \r\nconvicted by the ICTR, through to the appellate level. \r\nThe ICTR has since then handed down five acquittals; \r\nthis has not raised any protest from Rwanda. The \r\nTribunal finally chose to refer the 1999 incident, but it \r\nkept silent on the subsequent acquittals in order to \r\nportray Rwanda as a country that is opposed to \r\nacquittals. We view that as a serious misinterpretation \r\nand one without basis. We denounce the message in the \r\nruling that portrays our system as one that cannot be \r\ntrusted, because the ultimate beneficiaries of that trend \r\nare fugitives still at large. Unless the Chamber is not \r\naware of the regard and esteem it ought to attract, the \r\nruling amounts to an invitation to States not to \r\ncooperate with us. We are informed that the ICTR \r\nProsecutor intends to appeal the decision and we will \r\ncontinue to follow developments in the case with \r\ninterest. \r\n Rwanda is committed to upholding justice and \r\nending impunity. It is therefore incumbent upon the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly to \r\nestablish support mechanisms to bolster Rwanda’s \r\nefforts. Under such mechanisms, issues related to post-\r\nICTR residual functions could be addressed. \r\n At this juncture, Rwanda still believes that the \r\nmajor interest shared with the General Assembly is to \r\nfind an amicable conclusion to the ad hoc mandate of \r\nthe Tribunal. In this period, we need a more sustainable \r\nand long-term mechanism between States Members of \r\nthe United Nations and the Government of Rwanda, \r\nunder which the key issues — particularly the transfer \r\nand trial of all remaining ICTR cases, the pursuit of \r\nfugitives at large, the monitoring of service of \r\nsentences and the management of archives — would be \r\naddressed. We need a mechanism to ensure that the set \r\ngoals do not shift gradually. We need to guard against \r\nendless faits accomplis. It is through such a mechanism \r\nthat we can have a smooth and effective completion \r\nprocess. \r\n As pointed out previously, in March of this year \r\nRwanda signed an agreement on the service of \r\nsentences. We have completed all the arrangements for \r\nhaving all the convicts sent to Rwanda to serve their \r\nsentences. There is no legal or administrative ground \r\nfor the failure or delay in having the convicts sent to \r\nRwanda to serve their sentences. \r\n The issue of the transfer of archives to Rwanda \r\nremains pending. Consultations have been ongoing \r\nwith the team designated to study and make \r\nrecommendations on the matter. We reiterate our desire \r\nand readiness to take full custody of the archives. \r\nGiven that this undertaking is a crucial one, the earlier \r\nformal discussions can begin the better. \r\n I thank the President of the General Assembly, \r\nthe European Union and all other States for their \r\nsupport for the ICTR and for Rwanda. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We are grateful to the leadership of both \r\nTribunals for the annual reports submitted on the work \r\nof these bodies. \r\n First of all, allow me to recall that the Tribunals \r\nwere established by the Security Council in specific \r\nhistorical circumstances as a temporary measure \r\naimed, inter alia, at restoring and maintaining peace in \r\nthe regions as well as combating impunity in a \r\nsituation of the inability of the legal systems of the \r\nStates concerned to act. \r\n It is now self-evident that there has been a \r\nsubstantive change in these circumstances and that the \r\nterm set for these bodies is expiring. The primary goal \r\nof the Tribunals is the timely completion of pending \r\ncases regarding the highest-level leaders suspected of \r\nbeing most responsible for crimes. In accordance with \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 \r\n(2004), the other cases must be referred to national \r\njurisdictions. \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 18 \r\n \r\n We take note of the progress achieved in that \r\nrespect by the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda (ICTR), which is focusing its efforts on the \r\ntwo aforementioned issues. We consider the Tribunal’s \r\nmeasures on referral of a number of cases to national \r\njurisdictions to be of the utmost importance, and we \r\nwelcome the active steps undertaken by the Prosecutor \r\nin this regard. \r\n The report of the Rwanda Tribunal (A/63/209) \r\nhas a straightforward manner of providing information \r\non progress achieved here. The implementation of the \r\ncompletion strategy is declared to be the major goal of \r\nthe Tribunal, and statistical data on the status of cases \r\npending before the Tribunal is included in the summary. \r\n Regarding the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe former Yugoslavia (ICTY), as we see it, its \r\nleadership is losing sight of the parameters prescribed \r\nfor the work of the Tribunal. Indeed, in the entire \r\nreport (A/63/210), there is no section entitled \r\n“Completion strategy”. Progress in cases pending must \r\nbe deduced by comparing several reports. Instead, \r\nthere is an extensive section on the so-called \r\ndiplomatic activities of the ICTY — which, in fact, go \r\nbeyond its mandate — and the report complains about \r\nthe level of cooperation on the part of States. Here, we \r\nshould like to note the arrest of the indictees Župljanin \r\nand Karadžić, which demonstrates a high level of \r\ncooperation with the Court. \r\n The report cites no measures related to the \r\nclosing of the Tribunal. In addition, a claim is made \r\nthat all ICTY indictees should be tried by that organ \r\nand should not be referred to national jurisdictions. In \r\nour view, that policy reflects mistrust in the national \r\njudicial systems of the Balkan States and contradicts \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 \r\n(2004). Only a few of the ICTY indictees listed can be \r\ncharacterized as the most senior leaders suspected of \r\nbeing most responsible for crimes; more often, those in \r\nquestion are middle- and low-ranking military \r\ncommanders. \r\n Furthermore, we wish to emphasize that our \r\nposition of principle that States bear primary \r\nresponsibility for bringing to justice perpetrators of \r\nwar crimes and other serious international crimes \r\nremains unchanged. International criminal courts have \r\nonly a supplementary role to play, since they cannot \r\nreplace national judicial systems. \r\n Yet another issue that is not addressed in the \r\nreport is the Tribunal’s shortcomings in the area of \r\nwitness protection. Unfortunately, the inadequacy of \r\nthe measures taken in that regard contributed to a \r\nvirtual failure in the important case of Haradinaj and \r\nled to the acquittal of quite a few other accused or to \r\ntheir receiving ridiculous sentences. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the \r\ndeadlines set out in the completion strategy are fast \r\napproaching. The Tribunals have already acknowledged \r\ntheir inability to meet the first deadline — completion of \r\nthe cases before the Trial Chamber in the first instance \r\nby the end of 2008 — and, at their request, the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly have extended the \r\nmandates of the Tribunals’ judges until the end of \r\n2009. We wish to reiterate that that step is an \r\nexceptional measure that, we expect, will enable the \r\nTribunals to focus their efforts on priority goals and to \r\ncomplete their work on time. We believe that the \r\nCouncil will very soon be able to establish a \r\nmechanism for carrying out the Tribunals’ residual \r\nfunctions after their closure. \r\n Mr. Maqungo (South Africa): My delegation \r\nwishes to thank Mr. Fausto Pocar, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), and Mr. Dennis Byron, President \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR), for their statements introducing the reports of \r\ntheir respective Tribunals.  \r\n My delegation commends both Tribunals for the \r\nsteps they are taking to ensure that they achieve their \r\ncompletion strategies. In particular, we welcome the \r\nmeasures taken to increase the efficiency of the \r\nTribunals in processing trials by holding a high number \r\nof trials simultaneously, to amend their Rules of \r\nProcedure and Evidence for the purpose of expediting \r\nproceedings and to make optimum use of ad litem \r\njudges.  \r\n The completion strategies are time-bound. \r\nTherefore, notwithstanding the steps that the Tribunals \r\nare taking to increase efficiency, their cases will, owing \r\nto the passage of time and the inability to carry out \r\narrests within the lifetime of the Tribunals, have to be \r\nreferred to national jurisdictions. Thus, referrals to \r\nnational jurisdictions are central to achieving the \r\ncompletion strategies set out in resolution 1503 (2003) \r\nand 1534 (2004). \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n19 08-54686 \r\n \r\n To that end, we commend the various countries \r\nthat have accepted cases from the Tribunals. However, \r\nwe are particularly keen to see that the countries in \r\nwhich the crimes were committed assume the \r\nresponsibility of accepting referrals from the Tribunals. \r\nIn that light, we are particularly disappointed that the \r\nChamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda has to date declined the Prosecutor’s request \r\nto refer three cases to Rwanda. Having heard the \r\nstatement of the representative of Rwanda regarding \r\nthe steps that that country has taken and the interaction \r\nthat is taking place between it and the ICTR, it is our \r\nhope that there will be a careful study of that finding of \r\nthe Tribunal so that the necessary adjustments can be \r\nmade at the national level to enable referrals to take \r\nplace in the future. \r\n We therefore welcome any effort to provide \r\ntechnical assistance to Rwanda and the countries of the \r\nformer Yugoslavia to enable them to absorb cases from \r\nthe Criminal Tribunals and related cases. We strongly \r\nbelieve that justice sector reform is a critical element \r\nof post-conflict reconstruction and that it contributes to \r\nsecurity sector reform. \r\n With regard to both Tribunals, there are indicted \r\npersons still at large, some of whom are particularly \r\nhigh-level accused or are alleged to have committed \r\ncrimes that should be dealt with at the international level. \r\nFor example, we have been advised that, in relation to the \r\nICTR, there is a fugitive, Félicien Kabuga, and in relation \r\nto the ICTY there is Ratko Mladić. It is important that \r\nthose fugitives be swiftly brought to justice, and we call \r\nfor full cooperation with the Tribunals with a view to \r\ntheir arrest and surrender for trial. \r\n The fact that the Tribunals are working towards \r\ncompleting their work means that we must ensure that \r\nthey continue to receive sufficient resources to enable \r\nthem to complete their work on time. We must ensure \r\nthat the Tribunals are able to retain the judges and other \r\nstaff necessary to complete their work on time, consistent \r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions. \r\n As States, we must continue to extend \r\ncooperation with regard to the travel of witnesses, the \r\narrest and transfer of accused and the resettlement of \r\nindividuals acquitted by the Tribunals. Furthermore, \r\nwe need to address the issue of the legacy that will be \r\nleft by the Tribunals and to ensure that we preserve \r\ntheir achievements. The Tribunals were established by \r\nthe Security Council in keeping with its responsibility \r\nto maintain international peace and security. Therefore, \r\nas we consider their legacy and achievements, we have \r\nto measure them by the extent to which they have \r\ncontributed to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. We in South Africa believe that the \r\nTribunals have made an immense contribution to \r\nstability and peace, both in Rwanda and in the former \r\nYugoslavia. \r\n However, there will continue to be ongoing work \r\nto consolidate those achievements and to ensure the \r\npreservation of the Tribunals’ legacy. That work \r\nincludes ensuring that the passage of time does not \r\nresult in impunity for any fugitives. Therefore, an \r\ninternational mechanism for prosecuting the few high-\r\nlevel fugitives still at large will have to be established \r\nafter the work of the Tribunals has been completed. It \r\nis also important that the archives of the Tribunals be \r\npreserved and stored in a place where future \r\ngenerations, particularly in the affected countries, can \r\nhave access to them and draw lessons from the work of \r\nboth Tribunals. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these agenda items. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 67 and 68? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 10 and 101 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n \r\n  Report of the Peacebuilding Commission on its \r\nsecond session (A/63/92) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/63/218 and Corr.1) \r\n \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this meeting on the second report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We would first like to thank \r\nAmbassador Yukio Takasu of Japan for his valuable work \r\nin his capacity as Chairman of the Commission. The text \r\nof the second report reflects the quality of his work and \r\nthat of the Chairpersons of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations and the Working Group on Lessons \r\nLearned. I also want to extend my congratulations to \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 20 \r\n \r\nthe Peacebuilding Support Office, the efforts of which \r\ncontinue to be fundamental in achieving the objectives \r\nof the Commission. \r\n Chile, while reiterating its commitment to the work \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission and its programmes, \r\nwishes to state that a mission from Chile is currently \r\nunderway in Sierra Leone to explore a programme of \r\ncooperation in the areas of education and small business, \r\nin collaboration with the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP). That is in addition to Chile’s direct \r\ncontributions to the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n We want to underline the synergy that the \r\nChairperson of the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nChairpersons of the various configurations have \r\nestablished with the private sector. The effective \r\nparticipation of the private sector in the peacebuilding \r\nprocesses undoubtedly helps in the creation of jobs and \r\nthe efficient demobilization of those who once took up \r\narms, in particular young people. \r\n In that context, we have welcomed the \r\nstrengthening of the linkages between the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and international economic and financial \r\ninstitutions, in particular the International Monetary \r\nFund and the World Bank.  \r\n We are pleased that the Peacebuilding Fund has \r\nmore than met its original goal of $250 million. The \r\nFund has an essential role to play in the countries’ \r\nreconstruction. However, over the past two years, we \r\nhave witnessed the need for greater coordination \r\nbetween the Fund and the Secretariat. The delegation \r\nof Chile supports the suggestion by the Chairman of \r\nthe Commission to establish objective criteria for the \r\nselection of countries to be assisted by the Fund. \r\n I would like to reiterate that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission should not be perceived as yet another \r\ndevelopment agency. It is a commission aimed at \r\nhelping to identify national priorities and at combining, \r\nmobilizing and giving advice on the economic, \r\nfinancial and political forces at play in order to \r\npromote the integral reconstruction of countries \r\nemerging from crisis. \r\n The work of the Commission should, of course, \r\nshow clear results for the population of the countries \r\nconcerned. In that respect, education, support for small \r\nand medium-sized businesses and the strengthening of \r\ngovernment institutions are fundamental for lasting \r\npeace and efforts in those areas must go beyond quick-\r\nimpact projects. \r\n I want to once again emphasize the great \r\npotential of regional organizations in their joint efforts \r\nwith the Peacebuilding Commission, as in the case of \r\nthe concrete support lent to efforts for peacebuilding \r\nby the African Union. \r\n As the Chairperson of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has said, the Commission is a new organ, \r\nand is still evolving. It requires fine-tuning and better \r\ncoordination between the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice, the Organizational Committee and the country-\r\nspecific configurations, taking into consideration the \r\nfact that our workload has increased significantly, \r\nwhich complicates efficient and timely coordination. \r\nWe should also be aware of the challenge of deploying \r\nthe Commission on the ground in the context of the \r\nongoing efforts on system-wide coherence and the \r\nvision of attaining “One United Nations”. \r\n In addition, the evolution of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission should take into account the aspiration for \r\nadequate representation that Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean region have had since the Commission’s \r\ncreation. That aspiration was emphatically highlighted \r\nby the former Permanent Representative of Colombia \r\nin 2006, in her capacity as President of the Group of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, when the \r\nCommission was established. At that time, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean agreed to be \r\nunderrepresented, in terms of the representation they \r\njustly aspired to, but only in order to avoid blocking \r\nthe establishment of the Commission. However, we \r\nbelieve that now is the time to find a definitive solution \r\nto that anomaly, and we trust that that will happen well \r\nbefore the end of the year. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission should not work \r\nabove the Member States but work alongside them, \r\nwith a comprehensive vision through which to confront \r\nthe challenges of national ownership. We should take a \r\nlong-term view of the matter and consider, for \r\nexample, if the Commission could bring about the \r\nestablishment of a collaborative team of civil experts \r\nwho would be able deploy rapidly to the countries \r\nentering the peacebuilding stage, within the framework \r\nof the Commission. In that way we would be able to \r\nprovide much greater assistance to those countries. \r\n Lastly, I would like to call for continued efforts \r\naimed at achieving sustainable peace, stability and \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n21 08-54686 \r\n \r\ndevelopment in countries in which the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission could make a real contribution to \r\nconfronting future challenges. \r\n Ms. Gash (Australia): Australia remains a strong \r\nsupporter of the Peacebuilding Commission. Its \r\nestablishment in 2005 filled a significant institutional \r\ngap in the United Nations system in terms of assisting \r\npost-conflict States to consolidate peace and \r\ncommence the task of rebuilding. \r\n At the outset, allow me to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Takasu of Japan, whose enthusiasm and \r\nleadership as Chairperson of the Commission have \r\nhelped it to start to fulfil its potential. The future \r\nsuccess of the Commission will depend in no small \r\npart on the kind of sustained and active engagement \r\ndemonstrated by Ambassador Takasu and other chairs \r\nof the Commission. We also welcome the recent \r\nappointment of Jane Holl Lute as Assistant Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Peacebuilding Support, and we look \r\nforward to working with her in the coming years. \r\n The annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission illustrates both how much has been \r\nachieved and how much still remains to be achieved. In \r\nthe past 12 months, the Peacebuilding Commission has \r\nmoved beyond initial procedural difficulties, which \r\ndominated its formative stages, to develop more \r\neffective working methods. The agenda has now \r\nexpanded, with the inclusion of Guinea-Bissau and the \r\nCentral African Republic, reflecting a growing \r\nappreciation of the valuable role the Commission has \r\nto play in helping countries transition out of conflict \r\nsituations. Relations with United Nations partners, \r\ninternational financial institutions and regional \r\norganizations have improved and deepened. The \r\nCommission has also tackled important substantive \r\nissues, including the role of the private sector, youth \r\nemployment, transitional justice, gender and the \r\nenvironment in peacebuilding efforts. \r\n The results of that progress are clear. Strategic \r\nframeworks have now been adopted in partnership with \r\nBurundi, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Through the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, $86 million has been allocated to \r\npeacebuilding projects in countries on the Commission’s \r\nagenda.  \r\n Australia supports the use of the Peacebuilding \r\nFund as a catalytic tool to ensure the immediate release \r\nof resources to launch peacebuilding activities. Further \r\nefforts are required to strengthen processes to ensure \r\nthat the Peacebuilding Fund can deliver peace \r\ndividends in a timely fashion. We are equally \r\nencouraged that bilateral and multilateral donors have \r\nsupplemented those efforts with targeted assistance and \r\ntechnical expertise to generate more sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Equally importantly, the Commission continues \r\nto work in a flexible and innovative manner. Visits by \r\nthe Chairs have established strong connections with \r\nnational stakeholders and provided a timely way to \r\nrespond to events on the ground. Similarly, the creation \r\nand implementation of monitoring mechanisms \r\nprovides a useful way to maintain focus on \r\npeacebuilding efforts in the medium term. Increasingly \r\nsophisticated mapping exercises are also generating \r\nbetter information about existing gaps in international \r\nassistance. \r\n Australia welcomes those developments. They \r\ndemonstrate that working in a spirit of partnership, \r\nguided by the principle of national ownership, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has the potential to help \r\nStates emerge from conflict. \r\n While much has been achieved, the challenges \r\nahead are significant. As the Peacebuilding Commission \r\naccepts new countries, the demands on its time and \r\nexpertise will increase. Current efforts to streamline its \r\nwork are welcome and necessary, but the Commission \r\nwill have to continue to refine its approach. It is \r\nimportant that lessons learned be applied to new \r\ncountries as they are added to the agenda. \r\n The Commission, and in particular the country-\r\nspecific configurations, must work to improve the tools \r\nthat have been developed so far. Monitoring \r\nmechanisms must be refined to include specific \r\nindicators and benchmarks. Strategic frameworks \r\nshould continue to adapt to local conditions and strive \r\nto avoid duplication of existing efforts. The link \r\nbetween good strategy and tangible results on the \r\nground must remain a focus. \r\n Over the past two years, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has begun to build a valuable record of \r\npractice. As the central peacebuilding institution within \r\nthe United Nations system, the Commission must make \r\nsure that concrete experience with such issues as \r\nelections and land reform is translated into a wider \r\nbody of knowledge to inform future efforts. \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 22 \r\n \r\n In closing, it is worth noting that the path from \r\nconflict to peace is not always smooth. More than half \r\nof States emerging from conflict relapse within 10 \r\nyears. The demands of peacebuilding vary from case to \r\ncase, but are invariably complex and interrelated. They \r\ndemand a willingness to work together, to innovate and \r\nto redouble our commitment in the face of setbacks. \r\n Two years after its establishment, it is too early to \r\njudge the Peacebuilding Commission. However, there \r\nis reason for optimism. The modest progress made to \r\ndate is a solid foundation on which to build. Australia \r\nlooks forward to working with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission as it further develops its ability to assist \r\npost-conflict States. \r\n Mr. Ebner (Austria): Austria welcomes this \r\nopportunity to discuss the second annual report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/63/92) and the report of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund (A/63/218). \r\n Austria fully aligns itself with the statement that \r\nwas delivered by the representative of France on behalf \r\nof the European Union on this item. I will therefore \r\nlimit myself to the following few points. \r\n Two years after the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nbecame operational, it may be too early to make a final \r\nassessment, but it can be said that the Commission has \r\ndefinitely made important contributions to post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding in the countries on its agenda. Beyond \r\nthe actual cases on its agenda, the discussions in the \r\nCommission and on Integrated Peacebuilding Strategies \r\nhave contributed to the development of new partnerships \r\nand a whole new methodology. By engaging a wide \r\nrange of stakeholders in New York and in-country, the \r\nnew methodology is based on the active involvement \r\nof all concerned — ownership and commitment by \r\nnational actors coupled with a reciprocal commitment \r\nby outside partners to support the process of \r\npeacebuilding in a given country. \r\n At the same time, the experience of the first two \r\nyears seems to suggest that in its next sessions the \r\nCommission will also have to focus on ways to make \r\nits own work more efficient and effective. Otherwise, \r\nthe inclusion of new countries on its agenda might lead \r\nto paralysis in the Commission’s workings. \r\n Building on the experiences of the past two years, \r\nAustria recently invited a number of ambassadors, \r\nrepresentatives of international organizations and think \r\ntanks, and independent experts to a three-day retreat in \r\nAlpbach, Austria. In an informal setting under the \r\nChatham House Rule, participants were able to hold \r\ndiscussions in several working sessions under the \r\ngeneral topic of “Strengthening United Nations \r\npeacebuilding: creating resilient societies”. The concept \r\nof resilience as the ability of societies to withstand \r\nexternal shocks and deal with them without falling into \r\narmed conflict was widely acknowledged as an \r\nimportant contribution to the further development of \r\npeacebuilding as a concept. Also, participants agreed \r\nthat the regional dimension of peacebuilding warranted \r\nparticular attention, since conflicts are often intertwined. \r\n Furthermore, Austria attaches special importance \r\nto the systematic integration of a gender perspective \r\ninto all aspects of the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. We believe that gender-specific responses \r\nto the challenges to peacebuilding and the systematic \r\nparticipation of women in all aspects of peacebuilding \r\nprocesses are prerequisites for the success and long-\r\nterm sustainability of peacebuilding efforts. In that \r\ncontext, Austria welcomes the presidential statement of \r\nthe Security Council on mediation and the settlement \r\nof disputes. \r\n Austria appreciates the important role played by \r\nthe Peacebuilding Support Office since the establishment \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. Despite difficult \r\ncircumstances in the beginning, the Office has helped \r\nto successfully steer the Commission through its first \r\ntwo years. We commend the former head of the Office, \r\nAssistant Secretary-General Carolyn McAskie, for her \r\ninvaluable contributions and for her leadership in the \r\nstart-up phase of the Commission and the Office. At \r\nthe same time, I would like to extend a warm welcome \r\nto Assistant Secretary-General Jane Holl Lute. She will \r\nhave the important task of ensuring that the Office can \r\nindeed strengthen its ability to deliver substantial and \r\nsystematic support for the work of the Commission, \r\nboth in preparing for and servicing the work of the \r\nCommission in New York and in supporting the \r\nimplementation of agreed peacebuilding strategies in-\r\ncountry. \r\n In order to enable the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice to fulfil all those tasks, Austria has decided to \r\nsupport its crucial work by financing the position of a \r\nJunior Professional Officer for the next two years. We \r\nhope that that contribution will help in strengthening \r\nthe capacities of the Office. \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n23 08-54686 \r\n \r\n Finally, Austria views the Peacebuilding Fund as \r\nan important building block in the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture, with the potential to act in \r\nnew and innovative ways where other funding \r\nmechanisms are not available. That is why we have \r\nmade contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund every \r\nyear since 2006. Our contributions total some \r\n$2.1 million to date. The Fund has already made a \r\ndifference in a number of instances, both in countries \r\nthat are on the agenda of the Commission and in some \r\nthat are not. \r\n At the same time, the experience of the first two \r\nyears of Fund operations clearly shows that there is \r\nample room for improvement in the Fund’s workings. \r\nAs the European Union presidency underlined, \r\nimproving the efficiency of Fund management and its \r\nability to produce quick results on the ground are key \r\nto the Fund’s success. Austria welcomes the active role \r\nplayed by the Peacebuilding Fund Advisory Group and \r\nlooks forward to the recommendations that will \r\nemanate from the ongoing review by the Office for \r\nInternal Oversight Services on how to strengthen the \r\noperations of the Fund and its accountability. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation would like to thank the President of the \r\nAssembly for having convened this meeting to consider \r\nthe reports submitted by the Chairman of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/63/92) and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the Peacebuilding Fund (A/63/218). We \r\nhave taken due note of the two reports, which provide \r\nus with information on the progress made by those two \r\nbodies during their second session. \r\n My delegation is gratified to note that the two \r\nbodies are fulfilling their raison d’être. The work of the \r\nCommission has made it possible to establish a \r\ncoherent framework for an effective partnership of \r\nnational stakeholders with the international community \r\nin order to implement sustainable transformation in \r\ncountries emerging from conflict.  \r\n Within that framework, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has developed a wide range of activities \r\nthat have contributed to the drawing up of coherent \r\nrecovery and resource mobilization strategies to \r\npromote the national priorities highlighted by the \r\ncountries themselves. Having drawn up a Strategic \r\nFramework for Peacebuilding for Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone, the Commission has now done so for Guinea-\r\nBissau. That opens the way for the mobilization of the \r\nresources required to facilitate a normalization of the \r\nsituation. It is in that context that free and transparent \r\nelections will be held, significant domestic resources \r\nmobilized, the judiciary strengthened and the country’s \r\nresilience to ever more alarming threats of \r\ndestabilization looming over the nation in the area of \r\nsecurity and health will be reinforced. \r\n All of those measures must contribute to \r\nstrengthening the State in its sovereign functions so \r\nthat it can create conditions conducive to a lasting \r\npeace. We must emphasize the need to further focus \r\nurgent action on the most critical needs impacting the \r\ndaily lives of people. In that respect, we cannot \r\nunderestimate the importance of mobilizing resources \r\nto make the investments necessary to strengthen human \r\nresources and to establish or rebuild infrastructure vital \r\nto the proper functioning of a peacetime economy. \r\n Beyond the focus on institutions that make up the \r\nbackbone of the State, the Commission’s capacity to \r\npromote synergy must also be strengthened so that the \r\nresources mobilized can have the maximum impact in \r\nterms of improving the living conditions of the peoples \r\nof countries emerging from conflict.  \r\n In that sense, the role of the Peacebuilding Fund \r\nis crucial. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe disbursements made from the Fund for quick-\r\nimpact projects and to finance transitional programmes. \r\nHowever, we must note that such disbursements are not \r\nalways linked to specific actions decided on within the \r\nStrategic Framework for Peacebuilding. We would \r\ntherefore underscore the need for closer coordination \r\nbetween the implementation of the Strategic Frameworks \r\nand the interventions of the Peacebuilding Fund. We \r\npay tribute to the donor countries that have contributed \r\nto the Peacebuilding Fund. They have made it possible \r\nto operationalize that important instrument. \r\n We also welcome the extremely wise use that the \r\nSecretary-General has made of his prerogatives, which \r\nhas allowed such countries as the Comoros, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Nepal to benefit from the \r\nresources of the Fund. The Fund has breathed new life \r\ninto those countries in order to help them avoid \r\nconsiderable upheavals that could be highly damaging \r\nto their stability.  \r\n While encouraging the Secretary-General in that \r\nopportune role, there is also reason to strengthen the \r\ncapacity of the Fund to act more quickly in making \r\nemergency assistance available. The effectiveness of \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 24 \r\n \r\nsuch actions could be even greater in the case of \r\nimminent threats to peace caused by economic \r\ndifficulties in countries that are extremely fragile. \r\n In that respect, my country emphasizes the \r\nimportant role of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nWorking Group on Lessons Learned. Its analytical \r\nconclusions and recommendations must be widely \r\npublicized and integrated into the work of the agencies \r\nof the United Nations system working in the least \r\ndeveloped countries. The Commission must also use \r\nthe Working Group to hone the concept of the \r\nIntegrated Peacebuilding Strategy, both to coordinate \r\nthe efforts of the various partners and to provide for a \r\ndivision of labour on the ground based on the \r\nknown comparative advantages of public and private \r\nstakeholders alike. \r\n The Organizational Committee, the members of \r\nwhich constitute the core of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations of the Commission, must refine its \r\nanalytical capacity in order to strengthen its role in \r\ncarrying out the Commission’s functions. Particular \r\nimportance should be devoted to the follow-up to the \r\nimplementation of the agreed Strategic Frameworks for \r\nPeacebuilding. The follow-up mechanisms must work \r\nsystematically. \r\n My country made a major contribution to the \r\ndebates on the structure of the Commission. It intends \r\nto present its candidacy during the forthcoming elections \r\nin order to play a more active role in the activities of \r\nthe Commission and to share with the international \r\ncommunity its national experience in the area of \r\npeacebuilding and in the establishment of viable \r\ninstitutions that promote and strengthen democracy.  \r\n Ms. Plaisted (United States): Today’s discussion \r\nof the annual reports of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(A/63/92) and the Peacebuilding Fund (A/63/218) \r\nbrings to a close the second year of activity of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. In our view, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is beginning to find its \r\nplace within the United Nations and contribute to the \r\ninternational community’s response to the many \r\nchallenges faced by post-conflict countries. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission has achieved \r\ntangible results in the countries on its agenda. In Sierra \r\nLeone, the collaborative effort led by the Government \r\nand the Peacebuilding Commission has resulted in a \r\nStrategic Framework for Peacebuilding that is \r\nencouraging the entrance of new donors. In Burundi, \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission process has encouraged \r\nnational dialogue among all stakeholders on the difficult \r\nand sensitive issues that underlie recurring instability \r\nand conflict. In Guinea-Bissau, the Commission’s \r\npresence in-country has led to additional resources \r\nbeing made available for the reinforcement of the \r\nUnited Nations country team and to further attention \r\nbeing paid to regional strategies for combating drug \r\ntrafficking. \r\n In our view, the task of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in the coming year will be to sustain those \r\naccomplishments and extend them to all of the \r\ncountries on the Peacebuilding Commission’s agenda. \r\nThe Commission must be able to consistently muster \r\nadditional international resources for all of the countries \r\non its agenda. \r\n The Commission will need to better reach out to \r\ninternational peacebuilding expertise outside of the \r\nUnited Nations and find ways to scale up existing \r\nprogrammes that represent best practices. The \r\nCommission will need to find its voice in encouraging \r\nthe formation of integrated missions and better \r\ncoordinated planning among United Nations funds and \r\nprogrammes. An important albeit technical task for the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission will be the identification of \r\ngaps in fulfilling peacebuilding priorities and conducting \r\nthe analysis needed for accurately monitoring progress \r\ntowards meeting those gaps. \r\n The coming year will be a pivotal one for the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. The General Assembly will \r\nevaluate and possibly modify the terms of reference for \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund and the Secretary-General will \r\nlook anew at strengthening the United Nations response \r\nto early recovery situations. The Commission’s \r\ncontribution to those broader developments cannot be \r\ntaken for granted. More than ever, it is time for the \r\nCommission to justify its central place in United \r\nNations peacebuilding by achieving results on its own \r\nagenda and reaching out to incorporate the programmes \r\nand views of peacebuilding practitioners in the field. \r\nThe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil should take steps to support the Commission’s \r\nwork by moving expeditiously to fill their seats on the \r\nCommission during the coming term. \r\n We take this opportunity to thank the chairs \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission’s country-specific \r\nconfigurations, who have so generously donated much \r\nof their time and energy to facilitating the \r\n A/63/PV.24\r\n \r\n25 08-54686 \r\n \r\nCommission’s work in the field and in New York. We \r\nwant to extend special thanks to Ambassador Yukio \r\nTakasu for his leadership in New York and to former \r\nAssistant Secretary-General Carolyn McAskie for her \r\ncommitment to the Peacebuilding Support Office and \r\nthe Commission during their first two years. We \r\nwarmly welcome Jane Holl Lute, the new Assistant \r\nSecretary-General for Peacebuilding. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium) (spoke in French): I take \r\nthe opportunity provided by today’s debate to pay a \r\ntribute to the leadership of the Chairman of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, Mr. Yukio Takasu, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Japan, and to the work of \r\nhis team. We would also like to voice our great \r\nappreciation to the Peacebuilding Support Office and \r\nin particular to the two Assistant Secretaries-General \r\nwho have headed it, Carolyn McAskie, who played a \r\npioneering role, and Jane Holl Lute, whom we wish \r\nevery success and assure of our cooperation. \r\n The representative of France made a statement on \r\nbehalf of the members of the European Union with \r\nwhich Belgium associates itself. I recall the relevant \r\nrecommendations of that statement: to encourage the \r\nefforts of the Peacebuilding Support Office to \r\nstrengthen its capacity to act as a substantive support to \r\nthe Commission; to improve the Commission’s working \r\nmethods to make it more effective and strategic; and to \r\nconsider ways and means to define the entry points for \r\nthe engagement of the Commission, the progressive \r\nreduction of that commitment and the end of that \r\ncommitment. \r\n Another recommendation of the European Union \r\nconcerns the integration of the work of the \r\nCommission into the strategies of the Security Council \r\nas early in the process as possible. All of those \r\nrecommendations of the European Union, moreover, \r\nfor the most part overlap with those that were put \r\nforward here this past week by the Chairman of the \r\nCommission, the Permanent Representative of Japan. \r\n I would like to make a few additional comments \r\nin my national capacity, first on the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and then on the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n Today’s annual meeting marks the second year of \r\nour Commission’s existence. As might have been \r\nexpected of that new institution, it still needs to \r\nestablish a balance among its various objectives. Allow \r\nme to spell out a few aspects of that balance. \r\n First, there is the balance between two of its \r\nprimary objectives. Indeed, the dual mission of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission consists, on the one hand, \r\nof bringing together key actors in peacebuilding to \r\ndiscuss strategic issues, and, on the other, of closely \r\nfollowing the situation in the countries involved by \r\nmobilizing the resources required for their \r\ndevelopment. Within the framework of the limited \r\nresources available to the Commission, it is important \r\nto strike a proper balance between the efforts devoted \r\nto each of those two aspects.  \r\n Secondly, within the country-specific configurations, \r\ndialogue with the States involved must be conducted \r\nwith respect for yet another balance between the \r\ncentral role of national ownership and the functioning \r\nof the mechanisms through mutual commitments. In \r\nthat framework, a frank political dialogue between \r\npartners for peace is of pivotal importance. \r\n Thirdly and finally, we must, without losing sight \r\nof the long-term objectives, create a blueprint for work \r\nbased on concrete priorities that closely reflect the \r\nrealities on the ground. In that way we can hope to \r\ncreate a virtuous circle through achievements that are \r\ntruly tangible for people. \r\n Belgium has had the great honour of being \r\nassigned the particular responsibility of accompanying \r\nthe Central African Republic on its path to \r\nstabilization, together with the members of its country-\r\nspecific configuration. I would like to tell the \r\nAssembly how receptive we have been to the various \r\ncomments made and positions taken during this debate \r\nin order to integrate the observations and conclusions \r\nof the Assembly on these two years of Peacebuilding \r\nCommission experience into the way in which we will \r\nshoulder that responsibility. \r\n We are also here today to address the report of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund (A/63/218). Belgium is the \r\ntwelfth contributor to that instrument and in that \r\ncapacity is particularly interested in its proper \r\nfunctioning. The specific nature of the Peacebuilding \r\nFund and the way in which it complements the \r\nCommission require further thought. While the \r\ndifference between the two may be well understood in \r\nNew York, that is not always the case for the \r\nauthorities and the populations of the countries \r\ninvolved, in particular window-I countries. The more \r\nclearly its scope and criteria are defined, the more it \r\nA/63/PV.24  \r\n \r\n08-54686 26 \r\n \r\nwill be possible to make it the essential tool that it can \r\nbecome. \r\n In that context, we believe that it will be useful to \r\nexamine the lessons learned from the first two years, \r\nand we welcome the fact that that exercise is under \r\nway. We eagerly await the report of the Office for \r\nInternal Oversight Services and the recommendations \r\nof the Advisory Committee. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
