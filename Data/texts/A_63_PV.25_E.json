(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 10 and 101 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Peacebuilding Commission  \r\n \r\n  Report of the Peacebuilding Commission on its \r\nsecond session (A/63/92)  \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/63/218 and \r\nA/63/218/Corr.1) \r\n \r\n Mrs. Gallardo Hernández (El Salvador) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Allow me to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for your initiative in convening this joint \r\ndebate on the report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. We would also like to express our \r\nrecognition of Ambassador Takasu for his \r\ncommendable leadership as Chairman of our \r\nCommission. Furthermore, El Salvador adds its support \r\nto the ideas expressed in his statement. We would also \r\nlike to thank the Ambassadors of Norway, the \r\nNetherlands, Brazil and Belgium for the manner in \r\nwhich they are conducting their work on the various \r\ncountries under consideration. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission was established \r\nwith the purpose of creating a new peacebuilding \r\narchitecture within the United Nations system aimed at \r\nhelping countries emerging from conflict and moving \r\nfrom war to a process of development. This vision was \r\nshaped by the Heads of State and Government at the \r\n2005 World Summit. Since then, El Salvador has made \r\nthis vision its own, and we are thankful for the honour \r\nof having served as Vice-Chair of the Commission. By \r\nserving in the Commission, we are repaying the \r\ninternational community for the assistance we have \r\nreceived in difficult times. \r\n We have endeavoured to share our own \r\nexperiences of the peacebuilding process by imparting \r\na comprehensive vision of the process itself. We have \r\nalso endeavoured to provide information as requested \r\nregarding our experience in specific areas in which we \r\npassed through progressive successful stages, such as \r\nthe demobilization and reintegration of armed forces. \r\nWe have been able to share those experiences with \r\nGuinea-Bissau, in particular, by advising that country \r\non its national civilian police.  \r\n El Salvador will remain committed to dialogue \r\nwith the various actors involved on the ground in the \r\ncountries on the Commission’s agenda. Sharing \r\nexperiences also contributes to the prevention of the \r\nresurgence of violence by involving the various actors \r\nin this process and joining efforts with regional \r\norganizations as well as friendly countries, without \r\nneglecting efforts to implement strategies oriented \r\ntowards attaining genuinely sustainable development.  \r\n The Commission and the membership in general \r\nhave been strengthened by the work carried out by the \r\nWorking Group on Lessons Learned, over which \r\nEl Salvador is greatly honoured to preside. The \r\nWorking Group has considered a broad range of \r\nA/63/PV.25  \r\n \r\n08-54719 2 \r\n \r\nquestions: elections and risk reduction in post-conflict \r\nsituations; local governance and decentralization; \r\ntransitional justice; the situation of internally displaced \r\npersons in peacebuilding contexts; enhancing the \r\neconomic capabilities of States by providing support to \r\nnational budgets; and issues involving the \r\nenvironment, conflict and peacebuilding. The Working \r\nGroup has also dealt with cross-cutting issues that we \r\nconsider fundamental to the peacebuilding process, \r\nincluding gender in peacebuilding, by strengthening \r\nthe participation of women, and the importance of \r\nregional approaches in these processes. For my \r\ncountry, it is fundamental to ensure that the work of \r\nthis group be strengthened in the future, bearing in \r\nmind that opportunities for dialogue and exchanging \r\nexperiences and best practices enable us to give full \r\nconsideration to the various factors affecting \r\npeacebuilding in post-conflict countries. In fact, that \r\nconstitutes important value added to the work carried \r\nout by the other configurations of the Commission. For \r\nEl Salvador, strengthening our Commission’s \r\nrelationship with the General Assembly and with the \r\nEconomic and Social Council is of great importance.  \r\n With regard to the Peacebuilding Fund, we are \r\npleased to see that pledges have surpassed the expected \r\ngoal of $200 million. We agree with other delegations \r\nin advocating for greater coordination between the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and Commission and for greater \r\ntransparency and accountability. We also hope that, in \r\nthe future, the Peacebuilding Fund will be of benefit to \r\nnational or regional projects that can effect real change \r\non the ground and strengthen peacebuilding efforts. \r\nThe fact that there is no armed violence in a specific \r\ncontext or region should not exclude the possibility of \r\ntransferring resources to the key sectors of peace, \r\nsecurity and development.  \r\n El Salvador is conscious of the importance of the \r\nequitable participation of different regional groups in \r\nthe work of the Peacebuilding Commission, as, \r\nunfortunately, conflicts are not the exclusive preserve \r\nof any specific society; rather, they are the outcome of \r\na number of factors, both internal and international, \r\nwhich combine to evoke violent responses to the \r\nunfulfilled demands of various political and social \r\ngroups. From that standpoint, the more that the \r\ninternational community works together to embrace the \r\nwork of the Peacebuilding Commission, the more \r\nopportunity there will be for political dialogue and to \r\nshare experiences among post-conflict countries and \r\nbetween them and United Nations organs and to make \r\nconsiderable contributions to support communities in \r\nconflict in their attempts to peacefully overcome their \r\ndifferences by means of dialogue and negotiations \r\nbased upon a new national understanding. \r\n In view of the above, El Salvador calls upon \r\nregional groups to consider from the standpoint of \r\ninclusion and equitable participation the best possible \r\noptions to break out of the current deadlock and to \r\ndefine, in good faith, the composition of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission beginning in January 2009. \r\n Before concluding, allow me to make a brief \r\ncomment on the Peacebuilding Fund. We believe that \r\nwhat the Fund has succeeded in doing is praiseworthy. \r\nHowever, we also hope that the Fund will benefit both \r\nnational and regional projects which deserve \r\nconsideration. Once again, we are fully committed to \r\ncontinue to support the Commission and countries \r\nunder consideration and to share our experiences with \r\nthem. \r\n Mr. Cancela (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): As \r\nwe express our gratitude to Ambassador Takasu for his \r\nwork, we would like at the outset to stress the \r\nimportance of the documents that have been submitted; \r\nthe report of the Peacebuilding Commission (A/63/92) \r\nand the report on the Peacebuilding Fund (A/63/218).  \r\n In the last two years we have witnessed the \r\nstrengthening of the new institutions that were created \r\nat the 2005 Summit of heads of State and Government \r\nand in the specific case at hand — the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission — we can say that the new body has \r\nresponded in a competent and flexible way by \r\nconfronting the challenges of the various cases it \r\nhandles, as well as extending the scope of its \r\nprogramme to an increased number of countries.  \r\n From that viewpoint, we wish to stress the \r\nextension of the programme to the Central African \r\nRepublic and the requests submitted by other countries, \r\nwhich clearly indicate an increase in recognition and \r\ntrust for the work of the Commission. The development \r\nof integration strategies to deal with specific \r\ncircumstances has made it possible to improve political \r\ndialogue, to achieve coordination between national and \r\ninternational bodies and to improve the mustering of \r\nresources.  \r\n Likewise, we must stress the growth and \r\nappropriate use of the Peacebuilding Fund and its \r\n A/63/PV.25\r\n \r\n3 08-54719 \r\n \r\nsimplified implementation mechanism, as well as its \r\nbeing open to specific projects that can be carried out \r\nin advance of the acceptance of countries by the \r\nCommission. Those positive circumstances are \r\nextremely important, since the international community \r\nnotes with deep concern two trends that have been \r\nstrengthened in recent years. \r\n On the one hand, we observe that a large number \r\nof countries that are emerging from conflict are lacking \r\nbasic State institutions and thus require emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance. On the other hand and just as \r\nworrisome, is the fact that a large number of countries \r\nhave in the immediate present succeeded in emerging \r\nfrom situations of war and violence however, they very \r\nquickly relapse to the same situation, and we know full \r\nwell the outcome: the resumption of hostilities, the \r\nunleashing of violence against civilians, economic and \r\nsocial chaos and destruction of the State.  \r\n Peacekeeping is necessary, but it is not sufficient. \r\nThe efforts made by this Organization and its Member \r\nStates can best bear fruit only if — through \r\ncoordination and international cooperation — we help \r\nthe lawful authorities of those nations to build civil \r\nsociety — institutions, jurisprudence, citizenship — \r\nand political, social and economic factors that will \r\nmake it possible for them to become fully integrated in \r\nthe community of nations, bearing clearly in mind the \r\nparticular characteristics and sovereign decisions of \r\neach and every country.  \r\n That is why the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nrepresents for Uruguay the direct answer to the need \r\nfor an institutional mechanism within the United \r\nNations system that responds to the special needs of \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. \r\n Our country is firmly committed to strengthening \r\ninternational peace and security and its peacebuilding \r\nefforts can be seen by Uruguay’s significant \r\ncontribution of troops to peacekeeping operations — \r\nwhich is the largest per capita contribution in the \r\nworld. Since its first participation in peacekeeping \r\nuntil the present, Uruguay has garnered a wealth of \r\nexperience in the reconstruction and peacebuilding of \r\nareas devastated by conflict and has spared no effort to \r\nput an end to hostilities, so that communities can \r\nachieve peace and national reconciliation.  \r\n Uruguayan teams have provided major electoral \r\nassistance to States during elections and have also \r\nhelped to protect the populations in countries where \r\nthere is violence. But we note with sadness that this \r\nvaluable experience, as well as that of many other \r\nLatin American countries, has not been fully put to use \r\nto serve the international community, through the new \r\ninstitution.  \r\n In that connection, we cannot fail to once again \r\nexpress our profound concern at the lack of proper \r\nrepresentation of Latin American and Caribbean \r\ncountries on the Peacebuilding Commission, whose \r\ncomposition should reflect the participation of \r\ncountries in peacekeeping missions and the experience \r\nthey have acquired in peacebuilding, as well as an \r\nequitable geographical representation in order to \r\nensure consideration of recommendations that \r\nrepresent the various viewpoints of the large number of \r\nactors involved in peacebuilding in the aftermath of a \r\nconflict. \r\n Uruguay, which was the very first country to \r\nsubmit its candidacy among the Latin American group \r\nfor the elections that will be held in December 2008, \r\nreiterates its commitment to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions and peacebuilding throughout \r\nthe world and repeats its call to become part of the \r\nCommission. We will be involved in the Commission \r\nin the spirit of providing our experience and our desire \r\nto work and cooperate, which we believe to be in \r\naccordance with the multilateral mindset that our \r\ncountry has demonstrated throughout its history within \r\nthe Organization. \r\n Mr. Majoor (Netherlands): Today’s debate is \r\nimportant and I wish to thank you, Sir, for organizing \r\nit. It represents an opportunity to share our views on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission as well as the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, two years after both became \r\noperational. At the outset, let me say that I align myself \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of \r\nFrance on behalf of the European Union. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission has invested \r\nconsiderable time and effort over the past two years in \r\nimplementing its mandate through the development of \r\nthe appropriate strategic approaches and \r\nimplementation mechanisms. The result has been the \r\nconclusion of Peacebuilding Cooperation Frameworks \r\nfor three countries on its agenda — Burundi, Sierra \r\nLeone and, recently, Guinea-Bissau — based on an \r\nextensive mapping of peacebuilding gaps in those \r\ncountries. Those efforts, which the Commission has \r\nhad to undertake while operating in largely uncharted \r\nA/63/PV.25  \r\n \r\n08-54719 4 \r\n \r\nwaters, have involved the active participation of all \r\nrelevant stakeholders, ranging from the Governments \r\nof the countries concerned to the members of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the various \r\nstakeholders on the ground. \r\n While those are in themselves important \r\nachievements from which the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission should draw confidence, they are only a \r\nstepping stone towards the ultimate goal of the \r\nCommission. That goal is and must remain to make a \r\npositive difference in the countries on its agenda by \r\nensuring that the identified peacebuilding gaps are \r\neffectively addressed. That is, as has been reiterated \r\nmany times before, the most effective way to prevent a \r\nrelapse into conflict in countries that have been \r\nstruggling to strengthen their stability and democracy \r\nsince their conflict ended. This is therefore where the \r\nvalued added of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nultimately lies and is the basis on which the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission should be assessed. Taking \r\nit as our yardstick, we can fairly say that, while we \r\nrecognize the considerable achievements made by both \r\nthe Governments of the countries on its agenda and by \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission itself, we are not there \r\nyet. \r\n What is needed at this point in time — and this \r\nshould guide the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\nactivities in the coming months — is concrete support \r\nfrom existing and new donors alike to address the \r\npeacebuilding gaps that have been identified in the \r\ncountries on the Peacebuilding Commission’s agenda.  \r\n We have done the strategic work so far for \r\nBurundi, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. We have \r\ncommitted to ensuring that the identified gaps will be \r\naddressed. It is now time to translate our commitments \r\ninto concrete engagements. It is only when new \r\nresources and other forms of support have been \r\ngenerated that we can confidently say that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is living up to the high \r\nexpectations that surrounded its creation in 2005. \r\n It is only right that we should be regularly \r\nreviewing the way the Peacebuilding Commission has \r\nbeen operating, and good suggestions for its \r\nimprovement have been made. Similarly, it is \r\nappropriate that we consider how the functioning of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund can be further streamlined. In that \r\nregard, the ongoing evaluation by the Office of Internal \r\nOversight Services will certainly give us helpful \r\ninsights into how its operation might be improved. \r\n The Peacebuilding Support Office, under the \r\nenergetic new leadership of Assistant Secretary-\r\nGeneral Jane Holl Lute, will be crucial in providing \r\nsupport for the tasks at hand, as it has done in the past. \r\nIt is the Peacebuilding Commission’s membership that \r\nmust and will be most instrumental in achieving the \r\ngoals that we have set out to achieve. \r\n I draw confidence from the many statements that \r\nwe have heard since the beginning of this debate last \r\nweek. There is unwavering support for the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s original mandate and a \r\nconsensus that the Peacebuilding Commission is on the \r\nright track. We are all anxious to see the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission succeed, which in practice means that the \r\ncountries on its agenda succeed. However, the \r\nCommission’s success, unfortunately, is not determined \r\nby our vocal support or our endorsement of its \r\nmandate; it is determined by our readiness to make a \r\ncontribution in the country concerned. When the time \r\ncomes to thoroughly evaluate the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in light of its original mandate — and that \r\ntime will come — we must be confident that every \r\neffort was made to make it work. The time to make the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission work is now.  \r\n We have before us sufficient strategic documents \r\nto determine where our support is needed most. Let us \r\nnot waver; let us offer whatever expertise or funds we \r\ncan muster to ensure that the countries on the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s agenda are set on an \r\nirreversible track towards consolidated peace and \r\nstability. \r\n Mr. Kim Bonghyun (Republic of Korea): On \r\nbehalf of my delegation, I would like to thank the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission for its second annual report \r\n(A/63/92), as well as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his report on the Peacebuilding Fund (A/63/218). \r\nWe also appreciate the initiative of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to organize this timely opportunity \r\nto debate the reports. \r\n As is well reflected in the two reports before us, \r\nin the period of just over two years since it was \r\nformally established, the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nhas carried out its mandates effectively and shown \r\ngreat potential to become a key organ in coordinating \r\ninternational peacebuilding activities. In particular, \r\nsignificant progress has been made in the \r\n A/63/PV.25\r\n \r\n5 08-54719 \r\n \r\nCommission’s country-specific configurations, \r\nincreasing the on-the-ground results of our \r\npeacebuilding efforts. I would like to attribute the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s promising progress over \r\nthe past two years to the active contribution of all \r\nmembers of the Commission, and in particular to \r\nChairperson Ambassador Yukio Takasu, the Vice-\r\nChairpersons of the Commission and the Chairpersons \r\nof the country-specific configurations.  \r\n My delegation also highly values the role of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office and appreciates the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and Ms. Carolyn \r\nMcAskie in laying the foundations for the Office. My \r\ndelegation expects that the new leadership of Ms. Jane \r\nHoll Lute will guide the Office in further consolidating \r\nthe foundations of peacebuilding operations with her \r\nnoted professional experience in the area of \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nPeacebuilding Fund were among the major outcomes \r\nof the 2005 World Summit and, with the establishment \r\nof the Commission and the Fund, synergies among the \r\nthree pillars of the United Nations have certainly been \r\nstrengthened. Moreover, international support and \r\nassistance to post-conflict countries are better \r\nsystemized and integrated. The increasing number of \r\nsubjects on the Commission’s agenda indicates that the \r\nCommission is on track. My delegation is glad that the \r\nannual report of the Peacebuilding Commission also \r\nshares our estimation of the second-year activities of \r\nthe Commission. If the first year was a time for \r\nfoundation and preparation, the second year truly \r\nmarked the beginning of progress. To consolidate and \r\nmaintain the momentum of progress into its third year, \r\nI believe it is high time to consider the challenges \r\nbefore us. \r\n First, peacebuilding operations should be \r\nexecuted in a way that respects and further strengthens \r\nthe national ownership and priorities of recipient \r\ncountries. One of the ultimate goals of peacebuilding is \r\nto stabilize the post-conflict situation and establish a \r\nbasis for long-term sustainable development. To that \r\nend, national ownership needs to be respected and \r\nincorporated from the first steps of the rebuilding stage \r\nafter a conflict. \r\n Secondly, to prevent post-conflict countries from \r\nrelapsing into conflict situations, concrete results for \r\nthe people on the ground should be visualized quickly. \r\nIn that regard, I would like to emphasize the “three \r\nQs”: quick response, quick relief and quick impact. \r\nAmong other things, health issues should be focused \r\non when carrying out the three Qs because the results \r\nof the three Qs are most visible in those programmes \r\nconcerned with issues of public health care. Moreover, \r\nthose in post-conflict situations are in desperate need \r\nof public health care. Without public health-care issues \r\nbeing solved, no country will be able to move forward. \r\n Thirdly, the working methods of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission need to be further enhanced \r\nto respond more promptly, more effectively and more \r\nstrategically. To attain that goal, the Commission needs \r\nto place itself at the centre of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture and ensure coherent and \r\ncoordinated execution of United Nations peacebuilding \r\nactivities. \r\n Fourthly, the partnership among all stakeholders \r\nshould be strengthened with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission at its centre. Within the United Nations \r\nsystem, relations among the Commission, the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly need to be further \r\ndefined in a more strategic and coordinated manner. \r\nOutside the United Nations system, we need to make \r\nfurther efforts to establish strategic relations with the \r\nBretton Woods institutions, such as the World Bank \r\nand the International Monetary Fund. Considering the \r\nincreasing role of the private sector in the \r\npeacebuilding arena, we also need to continuously \r\nengage civil society organizations and other players in \r\nthe private sector. \r\n Fifthly, stable and predictable funding should be \r\nsecured. It is inspiring that the Peacebuilding Fund has \r\nattracted more than $269 million in pledges, exceeding \r\nits $250 million funding target, according to the \r\nSecretary-General’s report. However, the report also \r\nstates that 80 per cent of the deposited funds came \r\nfrom only eight donors. Although it is a good sign that \r\nover 20 developing countries have made contributions \r\nto the Fund, in order to secure more stable and \r\npredictable funding we need to further broaden and \r\ndiversify the donor base. \r\n Sixthly, today we are faced with an \r\nunprecedented crisis, often referred to as multiple \r\nchallenges — the food and energy crisis, development \r\nchallenges and climate change. The current volatile \r\nfinancial situation further complicates the already \r\nstaggering situation. Those challenges may negate the \r\nA/63/PV.25  \r\n \r\n08-54719 6 \r\n \r\naccomplishments we have painstakingly achieved, not \r\nonly in areas of development, but also in peacebuilding \r\nspheres. We need to be prepared to mitigate and \r\nminimize the effects of those grave challenges on our \r\npeacebuilding efforts. \r\n Finally, the transition from peacekeeping to \r\npeacebuilding and subsequent long-term sustainable \r\ndevelopment should be a seamless process. Carefully \r\ndesigned strategies and close cooperative relations with \r\nall stakeholders are necessary to minimize any gaps \r\nbetween each stage. We understand that the current \r\nstrategic framework of each country-specific \r\nconfiguration has been carefully developed to that end. \r\n Mr. Cujba (Republic of Moldova), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n Just half a century ago, the Republic of Korea \r\nwas a country emerging from conflict. With the timely \r\nand efficient assistance of the international community \r\nand the United Nations, we were able to build peace \r\nand attain long-term development. From our own \r\nexperience, we understand and value the importance of \r\npeacebuilding activities. Drawing from that \r\nbackground, Korea has already contributed $3 million \r\nto the Peacebuilding Fund and we look forward to \r\njoining and actively contributing to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission next year. It will be a valuable \r\nopportunity for Korea to use our past experience to \r\nhelp repay the international community and facilitate \r\npost-conflict countries to rebuild and develop. \r\n Mr. Palouš (Czech Republic): The Czech \r\nRepublic fully aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of France on behalf of the European \r\nUnion, and I would like to add some remarks in my \r\nnational capacity. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice are pillars of the new peacebuilding architecture \r\ncreated by the Millennium Summit. We are very happy \r\nthat the Peacebuilding Commission in its second year \r\nof existence has demonstrated itself to be a vital part of \r\nUnited Nations reform and has proved its added value. \r\nDuring that period, a number of things were achieved. \r\nTwo new countries — Guinea-Bissau and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic — were placed on the agenda of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission; the Peacebuilding \r\nCooperation Framework for Sierra Leone and the \r\nmonitoring and tracking mechanism for Burundi were \r\nadopted; and the Strategic Peacebuilding Framework \r\nfor Guinea-Bissau was recently finalized and formally \r\napproved. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission proved its added \r\nvalue in helping countries on its agenda during difficult \r\nperiods. The Commission provided important \r\nassistance during the preparation of the democratic \r\nelections in Sierra Leone and continued its work in \r\nclose cooperation with the new Government formed by \r\nthe results of the elections. In Burundi, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission provided assistance with \r\nissues negatively affecting the country’s efforts to \r\nconsolidate peace and representing potential crises, \r\nincluding a fragile budgetary situation and a \r\nparliamentary deadlock. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission further improved \r\nits role in marshalling resources. We highly appreciate \r\nthe efforts of the Chairman of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Chairs of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations to establish and further develop contacts \r\nwith the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund \r\nand other banking institutions. Significant efforts were \r\ndevoted to outreach activities with the regional \r\norganizations and important donors. \r\n An important role of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission is to provide advice to the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council. We welcome the \r\ninitiative of the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session to invite the Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to brief the Assembly on \r\nthe work of the Commission. The briefings to the \r\nSecurity Council by the Commission’s Chair and the \r\nChairs of the country-specific configurations have \r\nbecome a useful practice. Indeed, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, thanks to its innovative methods — \r\nincluding the use of modern technology such as video \r\nlinks organizing field missions of Commission \r\ndelegations and in developing contacts with all \r\nstakeholders, including civil society, women and youth \r\norganizations — is able to provide updated information \r\non the progress of peacebuilding efforts in the \r\ncountries on its agenda. \r\n We are of the opinion that one of the most \r\nimportant roles of the Peacebuilding Commission is to \r\nmobilize the entire United Nations system for \r\npeacebuilding efforts in the countries on its agenda. \r\nWhile a number of things have been accomplished, \r\nmuch more lies ahead. Peacebuilding is a complex \r\neffort based on social, economic and political \r\n A/63/PV.25\r\n \r\n7 08-54719 \r\n \r\ndevelopment. It consists of many interlinked tasks, \r\nfrom security sector reform, the promotion of human \r\nrights and the rule of law to sustainable economic and \r\nsocial development, including the development of \r\neducational and health systems. The more active \r\ninvolvement of the special United Nations agencies, \r\nsuch as UNESCO, the International Labour \r\nOrganization and the World Health Organization, to \r\nmention only some, is indispensable. The link with \r\nsystem-wide coherence reform is clear. Countries on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission’s agenda could serve as \r\na very good example of the realization of the goal of \r\ndelivering as one. \r\n The Czech Republic is a country that annually \r\ncontributes to the Peacebuilding Fund, and our next \r\ncontribution will be provided before the end of the \r\nyear. As a Peacebuilding Fund donor country, we are \r\npleased by the success of the Fund, manifested by its \r\ncapability to attract pledges exceeding the initial target. \r\nThirty-seven peacebuilding projects have already been \r\napproved and are in different stages of realization. The \r\nthree windows mechanism has proved to be an \r\nappropriate tool for coping with different situations in \r\ndifferent countries. We would like to see the Fund act \r\nas a catalyst to attract other donors to invest in the \r\ngiven countries. Based on the mapping exercise, the \r\nprojects financed from the Peacebuilding Fund should \r\nalso be used to cover gaps in peacebuilding activities. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to stress how much \r\nthe Czech Republic is honoured to be a member of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission during this exciting period \r\nwhen the foundations of the Commission’s future \r\nactivities are laid down. I take this opportunity to \r\nreiterate our firm support for peacebuilding activities. \r\n Mr. Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in French): I \r\nhave known Ambassador Yukio Takasu for a great \r\nmany years now, and it is with a great deal of pleasure \r\nthat, on behalf of my delegation, I extend to him our \r\nmost heartfelt congratulations for the work he has \r\ncarried out and for his outstanding presentation of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s report. The report \r\nhighlights the important role played by the \r\nCommission in helping the countries concerned to \r\nrecover from post-conflict situations and ensure that \r\nthey do not plunge back into conflict.  \r\n My delegation’s appreciation also goes to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his report on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund. We are also grateful to \r\nAssistant Secretary-General Holl Lute, who is well-\r\nknown for her energy, dynamism and pragmatism. We \r\nwould like to thank the various donor States, whose \r\ngenerosity has enabled the Commission’s work to be \r\ncarried out in Burundi, Sierra Leone and Guinea-\r\nBissau. That ever-growing generosity has also allowed \r\nfor the inclusion of other countries on the \r\nCommission’s agenda. \r\n The delegation of Cameroon would like to \r\nassociate itself with the statement made by \r\nAmbassador Raymond Wolfe of Jamaica on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement.  \r\n In its second year of existence, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has undertaken a certain number of \r\nactivities, resulting in the determination of the \r\npriorities for the programme of work and action of the \r\nOrganizational Committee. The cooperation between \r\nthe Commission and the main United Nations bodies, \r\nincluding the Security Council, the General Assembly \r\nand the Economic and Social Council, has ensured, \r\ngiven their theoretical and institutional expertise on \r\nvarious issues, concrete results in the countries on the \r\nCommission’s agenda.  \r\n During the period under consideration, major \r\nareas of peacebuilding work were supported by more \r\npragmatic methods of work and procedures, enabling \r\nthe successful financing of the various training \r\nmissions in Burundi, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. \r\nOutstanding progress has generally been achieved in \r\nthat field, culminating in the adoption by the \r\nCommission, the respective Governments and various \r\nstakeholders of the conclusions and recommendations \r\non the implementation of Strategic Peacebuilding \r\nFrameworks.  \r\n My delegation also welcomes the analysis carried \r\nout on the progress achieved and, in that respect \r\nsupports the integrated strategy concepts for \r\npeacebuilding spelled out in the report, inter alia \r\nconcerning the effectiveness of all peacebuilding \r\nactivities and the mobilization of the resources \r\nnecessary for those activities.  \r\n Cameroon, as a troop-contributing country \r\nsupporting United Nations peacekeeping efforts, \r\nreiterates its readiness to cooperate in promoting the \r\nCommission’s work. To that end, my delegation \r\nreiterates the hope expressed in the report of seeing \r\nMember States reach a consensus on the allocation of \r\nA/63/PV.25  \r\n \r\n08-54719 8 \r\n \r\nseats by regional group during the election of the \r\nmembers of the Organizational Committee. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission and its Fund are \r\ntwo recent United Nations initiatives. With regard to \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund in particular, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report maintains that, in its second year of \r\nexistence, the Fund has become a unique strategic \r\ninstrument, capable of taking the necessary risks and \r\nplaying the role of catalyst in supporting peacebuilding \r\nin States emerging from conflict. My delegation, along \r\nwith many other previous speakers, supports that \r\nfarsighted vision.  \r\n However, the multitude of players, in particular \r\nin the cooperation between the Peacebuilding Fund and \r\nvarious partners and other funds, gives rise to genuine \r\nconcern, as highlighted in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport. In that connection, the report concludes that, \r\nwith regard to the future direction of the Fund and its \r\nmethods of work,  \r\n  “The concept of peacebuilding is not well \r\nunderstood by all actors (…) The Fund’s terms of \r\nreference should clearly define and publicize the \r\nscope of early peacebuilding activities to ensure \r\nthat the Fund focuses on delivering strategic, \r\nvalue-added results” (A/63/218, para. 54). \r\n In that context, and especially with regard to the \r\nmistakes of the past in the management of certain other \r\nfunds, my delegation advocates transparent \r\nmanagement of the Fund’s resources. We endorse the \r\nprinciple of carrying out ongoing assessments of the \r\ncriteria and directives currently being used, on the \r\nbasis of achieving an appropriate balance between \r\nexperience in the field and the financing of projects.  \r\n Finally, we support the guidelines suggested for \r\nimproving the Fund’s intervention mechanisms, in \r\nparticular through the simplification of project \r\nimplementation procedures. That will allow us, in the \r\nlong term, to ensure effective action and to avoid the \r\ndelays noted during the reporting period in Sierra \r\nLeone and Burundi. \r\n For my delegation, the main objectives of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and its Fund are to \r\nprescribe a useful and effective course of treatment to \r\nrapidly heal the traumatic post-conflict wounds and \r\ncontribute at the same time to a full recovery from \r\nthem. Close coordination must therefore take place \r\nbetween the various actors and partners in the field of \r\ndevelopment, to enable each of them to play their \r\nrightful role, under the supervision of government and \r\nnational authorities, in the full range of actions \r\nundertaken. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French): \r\nThis consideration of the report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, together with the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on the Peacebuilding Fund, provides us with an \r\nopportunity to consider the very real progress achieved \r\nsince the first report, which we reviewed last year. \r\n Indeed, it is an opportunity for us to welcome the \r\nconsiderable progress made in implementing the \r\ndecision emanating from the 2005 World Summit, held \r\nhere. The major objective of the Summit was to ensure \r\nthat, working together, we could create a mechanism \r\nthat could make a difference. That is precisely what we \r\nare witnessing. The Peacebuilding Commission has \r\nturned out to be an extraordinary mechanism, a \r\nmechanism that is at the disposal of the people, who \r\nneed it in order to, together with the international \r\ncommunity, build peace and create the conditions for \r\nsustainable development. \r\n I would like, at the outset, to wholeheartedly \r\nthank the Chairperson of the Commission, our \r\ncolleague from Japan, Ambassador Takasu. In his work \r\nin the Commission, Ambassador Takasu has \r\ncontributed not only his own personal experience, but \r\nalso the commitment of his country, Japan, which is a \r\nclose friend of Africa. His country is a friend to a \r\ncontinent that needs support and help in its efforts to \r\nrestore peace where it is threatened and to reconcile the \r\nparties to conflict wherever it arises, but also to create \r\nthe conditions necessary for true development, because \r\nthat is the end goal and the objective that we have set \r\nfor ourselves. I would also like to express to him and to \r\nthe Vice-Chairpersons of the Commission our full \r\nappreciation for their joint efforts, for having in the \r\npast year worked with dedication, devotion and \r\nperseverance in the cause of the international \r\ncommunity, in particular the cause of the neediest \r\ncountries, including my own, Guinea-Bissau.  \r\n I would like to state that we have been very \r\nimpressed by the work that has been done by the \r\nexcellent team under the leadership of Ms. Carolyn \r\nMcAskie, who left this past summer. She had headed \r\nup the Peacebuilding Support Office. She was an \r\nexcellent leader, with the support of an extremely \r\ncompetent team. I would like to pay tribute to her here \r\n A/63/PV.25\r\n \r\n9 08-54719 \r\n \r\nand now, while stating, on behalf of my delegation, \r\nhow pleased I am that the Secretary-General has \r\nchosen such a competent, committed and — in \r\nthe words of my colleague, the representative of \r\nCameroon — pragmatic woman to replace her as \r\nMs. Jane Holl Lute. We are convinced that, working \r\ntogether, we can continue the work we have begun and \r\nensure that this extraordinary mechanism can provide \r\nwhat is expected of it, namely that we can work \r\ntogether to build peace wherever we need such an \r\neffort to be made. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission, as can be seen \r\nfrom the report introduced by its Chairperson \r\n(A/63/92), has, as I stated, proved to be an impressive \r\nmechanism, first of all because of its innovative \r\ncharacter. We have been able to see, through it, that, \r\nworking together, we can do a great deal — and do a \r\ngreat deal better. Working together means including all \r\nthe stakeholders, all those who are able to make a \r\ncontribution, such as civil society in the countries \r\nconcerned, but especially development partners and, \r\neven better, the Bretton Woods institutions, which have \r\nproven to be not only important but truly committed \r\npartners. They too have been willing to innovate.  \r\n It is indeed a matter of innovation to leave the \r\nbeaten path, to ensure that that mechanism, which was \r\nwilled into being and established by our heads of State \r\nand is the expression of a hope expressed by all of us \r\nhere in the General Assembly, is truly something new \r\nand is able to work in a different way. It should be able \r\nto ensure that the hopes that often arise from the \r\ndecisions taken by everyone here and by the various \r\ncommittees at the United Nations, not only are an \r\nexpression of the solidarity we owe to the people who \r\nneed our help, but also ensure that those decisions are \r\nfollowed by action.  \r\n Very often, the criticism — which is a fair one, in \r\nmy delegation’s view — levelled against the United \r\nNations system as a whole is that we discuss a great \r\ndeal and we take many decisions, but those decisions \r\nare very often not followed by action. That is where the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is fundamentally different. \r\nIt eloquently demonstrates that when we innovate, \r\nwhen we are determined and when we combine our \r\nefforts, our knowledge and, in particular, the support \r\nthat can be provided by countries able to offer it, \r\nassistance can be given to the countries in question. \r\nThat assistance should not be only in the form of \r\nfinancial support. More than that, we need to be \r\nencouraged to proceed democratically within our \r\ncountries, to elect our leaders democratically, to \r\npromote dialogue and cooperation, to promote the rule \r\nof law and to ensure that, through inclusive and \r\nparticipatory democracy, all the sons and daughters of \r\nour countries can be called upon to manage their own \r\ncountry. That is the key problem, and very often, that is \r\nthe source of conflict, particularly in Africa: hegemony \r\nand lack of inclusion.  \r\n I would therefore like to state that, thanks to this \r\npartnership that we have been able to establish between \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, the countries on its \r\nagenda — which are represented by their authorities \r\nbut also by civil society organizations, women, young \r\npeople and political parties — and the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions, we have been able to establish a true \r\npartnership that truly works. The outcome of that \r\npartnership is real, tangible and irrefutable, as \r\nhighlighted in the report presented by the \r\nCommission’s very able Chairperson, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Japan.  \r\n As regards Guinea-Bissau, which since December \r\n2004 has been on the agenda of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, we are extremely satisfied. We are \r\nsatisfied because the Commission has provided a link \r\nwithin our own society to ensure that the key \r\nfoundation of democracy is respected. That foundation \r\nis inclusion, which breathes fresh life into the \r\ndemocratic process and gives new meaning to the idea \r\nof inclusive democracy.  \r\n We have been able to work with the Commission \r\nto ensure that all those concerned about the future of \r\nGuinea-Bissau can take part in the management of the \r\ncountry. The country-specific configuration for \r\nGuinea-Bissau is headed by Ambassador Viotti, \r\nour colleague from Brazil, and its team visited Guinea-\r\nBissau this past April. Along with my own \r\ncompatriots — and when I say compatriots, I include \r\neverybody, as I stated earlier, not only Government \r\nrepresentatives but also civil society, women, young \r\npeople and political parties, in other words, all of the \r\nstakeholders — it has been able to bring about \r\nagreement, through constructive dialogue, on the \r\nstrategy that was just adopted at the beginning of this \r\nmonth.  \r\n The strategy is the outcome of an effort that \r\nincluded everyone, and it reflects the participation of \r\neach and every stakeholder. It is thanks to that new, \r\nA/63/PV.25  \r\n \r\n08-54719 10 \r\n \r\nparticipative approach that we have been able to \r\nestablish the Strategic Framework for Peacebuilding in \r\nGuinea-Bissau, which will be the engine for achieving \r\npeacebuilding in our country. \r\n We highly appreciate the support that has been \r\nprovided to us, not only by all the members of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the members of the \r\ncountry-specific configuration for Guinea-Bissau, but \r\nalso all of our development partners, in particular the \r\nBretton Woods institutions. I hope that, very soon, we \r\nwill be able to implement the comprehensive Strategic \r\nFramework, which will allow Guinea-Bissau to take an \r\nimportant step forward in our peacebuilding efforts. We \r\ndo know that the Peacebuilding Commission is not a \r\ndevelopment agency. The Commission will help us to \r\nlay the foundations that are needed to consolidate \r\ndemocracy and ensure proper development for our \r\ncountry.  \r\n As Ambassador Kim Bonghyun, the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea, reminded us a \r\nmoment ago, 50 years ago, the Republic of Korea had \r\njust emerged from conflict. That is a very clear \r\nexample that should encourage us and show us clearly \r\nthat conflicts are not inevitable. We can emerge from \r\nconflict if we are resolved to ensure that national \r\nreconciliation and peace can take hold in our countries \r\nand that, together, all citizens can combine their efforts \r\nand energies to work together and leave \r\nunderdevelopment behind. Underdevelopment is not \r\ninevitable, and the Republic of Korea is the clearest \r\nproof of that.  \r\n With regard to the Peacebuilding Fund, we are \r\nindebted to all the countries that have contributed to \r\nthe Fund. We have, of course, surpassed the established \r\ntargets, but that is not enough, of course, in the light of \r\neverything that is expected from the Fund. We should \r\ntherefore not be too self-satisfied. While thanking each \r\nand every person who has contributed — and they are \r\nmany — we should encourage them to persevere and \r\ncontribute more. We should also encourage those who \r\nhave not yet done so to contribute to the Fund. Believe \r\nme, that is a real and very profitable investment. To \r\ninvest in peacebuilding is an investment in the future \r\nof international peace. I think we must continue to say \r\nthat those who have contributed to the Fund have made \r\nthe right choice, and on behalf of my country, I thank \r\nthem. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to say that all those who \r\nhave contributed so far to the Fund are making a \r\ndifference in countries such as Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, \r\nGuinea, Haiti and, more recently, Kenya. Here again, \r\nwe are indebted to them for their solidarity. \r\n Finally, we must continue to work together so \r\nthat the Peacebuilding Commission may truly be a \r\ngreat mechanism, as I mentioned earlier, a mechanism \r\nthat will make a difference and show that a reformed \r\nUnited Nations, when we the Member States so desire, \r\ncan be innovative, realistic and pragmatic. When we do \r\nso, we can make a difference and blaze a new trail. We \r\ncan make a difference with the speeches we make here \r\nand the decisions that we adopt, which must be \r\nfollowed by action. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/32 of 19 November \r\n2002, I now call on the observer of the  \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Mr. Motter (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I am \r\npleased to address the General Assembly on the second \r\nannual report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(A/63/92). Allow me at the outset to commend the \r\nCommission for its great contribution to the revival of \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. Its much-needed \r\nassistance in stabilizing and strengthening governing \r\ninstitutions and, in so doing, enhancing their capacity \r\nto sustain peace is greatly appreciated. \r\n I am pleased to point out that since its  \r\ninception, the Peacebuilding Commission and the  \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) have enjoyed close \r\ncooperation, especially in the context of strengthening \r\nthe role and capacity of parliaments to contribute to \r\npeace processes. The IPU looks forward to pursuing \r\nthat cooperation with the Commission. \r\n It is obvious why the international community \r\nshould continue to include parliaments in efforts to \r\nbring peace and stability to conflict-prone societies. \r\nIndeed, parliaments’ role in articulating and mediating \r\nbetween the divergent interests in societies contribute \r\nin no small way to helping transform societies from \r\nconflict to sustainable peace. A key challenge for the \r\ninternational community is to ensure that parliaments \r\nin post-conflict societies, which, like other governing \r\ninstitutions, are weak or have been undermined by the \r\nconflict, are given the means to perform their functions \r\neffectively. The fact that such parliaments are often \r\ncomposed of the very same actors who have been party \r\n A/63/PV.25\r\n \r\n11 08-54719 \r\n \r\nto the conflict makes a particularly strong case for \r\ncontinued efforts by the international community to \r\npromote dialogue and a culture of tolerance. It is the \r\nhope of the IPU that the Commission will continue to \r\npay particular attention to that major challenge. \r\n The IPU, for its part, is committed to supporting \r\nparliaments in post-conflict countries. In June this year, \r\nit launched a far-reaching project that aims to \r\nstrengthen the role of parliaments in English-speaking \r\nAfrican countries in promoting inclusive political \r\nprocesses, institutional reform and reconciliation. \r\nParliaments benefiting from that support include those \r\nof Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, \r\nSomalia, Sudan and Uganda. Zimbabwe will hopefully \r\njoin the list.  \r\n The project brought together members of \r\nparliament from those countries at a regional seminar \r\nin Sierra Leone to discuss issues that parliaments \r\nshould factor into their strategies for promoting \r\nnational peacebuilding and reconciliation processes. \r\nThey include transitional justice mechanisms, the \r\nestablishment of appropriate reparation policies, the \r\nrole of women, the controversial issue of amnesty, the \r\npursuit of justice — including national versus \r\ninternational courts — security sector reform and many \r\nmore. The experiences shared at the seminar \r\nhighlighted the potential that parliaments have to bring \r\npeople closer and that, if managed well, they can serve \r\nas an important vehicle for political mediation and \r\naction and for the equitable allocation of resources to \r\naddress the needs of the population. Participants came \r\naway with the strong conviction that reconciliation was \r\nnot an event but rather a healing process that affects \r\nthe lives of several generations and also that \r\nperseverance was essential in the process.  \r\n Also in June of this year, the IPU, in cooperation \r\nwith the Peacebuilding Commission, organized a panel \r\ndiscussion in New York on parliaments, peacebuilding \r\nand reconciliation, which brought forth relevant \r\nexperiences from Burundi, Central America and South \r\nAfrica. The debate touched on a number of aspects and \r\nchallenges, including the role of former combatants, \r\nthe financing of political parties and the need for the \r\ninternational community to assist in developing a \r\nculture of shared responsibilities among minority and  \r\n \r\nmajority political parties. The meeting helped identify \r\nlessons learned and good practices and pinpointed \r\npractical ways to implement those good practices. \r\n Needless to say, the IPU has been keen and \r\npleased to proffer support to Peacebuilding \r\nCommission efforts at the national level, especially in \r\nBurundi and Sierra Leone. In Burundi, the IPU has \r\nbeen engaged with the parliament to assist it in \r\npromoting dialogue and establishing mechanisms that \r\npromote inclusiveness in decision-making. It has also \r\ncontinued to provide assistance to women \r\nparliamentarians. \r\n In Sierra Leone, at the request of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the IPU carried out a \r\ncomprehensive assessment of the needs of the \r\nparliament in October 2007. The challenges facing the \r\nparliament are typical ones for a post-conflict \r\nenvironment. The wounds of conflict have yet to be \r\ncompletely healed, and Sierra Leone remains a fragile \r\nand volatile society. The parliament faces the daunting \r\ntask of putting the pieces of Sierra Leonean society \r\nback together. National reconciliation and transitional \r\njustice will therefore continue to be at the top of the \r\nagenda. The IPU, in cooperation with UNDP, intends to \r\nbuild on that assessment to identify specific \r\ninterventions that will enable the parliament to come to \r\ngrips with those challenges. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that a parliament \r\nis a complex institution whose potential to deliver is \r\nnot always guaranteed. The challenge for the \r\ninternational community is therefore to take \r\ncognizance of parliament’s role and complexity and to \r\nnurture its full capacity. In that regard, we are pleased \r\nthat the Commission has continued to place the needs \r\nof democratically elected parliaments high on its \r\nagenda. For our part, we will continue to raise \r\nawareness of the work of the Commission among our \r\nmembers along the lines indicated in the report. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items. May I take it that \r\nit is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 10 and 101? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 4.20 p.m. \r\n"
