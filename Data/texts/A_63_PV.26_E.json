As the global financial crisis deepens, so \r\ndoes my concern that our commitments may be \r\nundone. That would be an unforgivable reversal and \r\nbring shame on all of us. While it is understandable \r\nthat political concerns and financial constraints at \r\nhome might make us waiver, we must keep in mind \r\nthat this planet is our home and that Africans are our \r\nbrothers and sisters. We cannot, as so often in the past, \r\nlook away. \r\n It is unpopular for politicians to say such things, \r\nbut we have reached a point when real belt-tightening, \r\nand even painful sacrifices, are required. It is also \r\nnecessary that those sacrifices be shared by all of us \r\nwithout exception. \r\n During the general debate we had an opportunity \r\nto hold a high-level debate on Africa’s development \r\nneeds and reviewed the status of implementation of \r\nvarious commitments. I was heartened by the \r\ndeclarations of world leaders, who often passionately \r\nappealed to all of us to deliver despite the darkening \r\nhorizon. By the time we meet at Doha at the end of \r\nNovember to consider financing for development, the \r\nfull brunt of the financial storm will be upon us. Let us \r\ntake every opportunity, including our review today of \r\nthe encouraging progress being made within the \r\nframework of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, to reiterate our solidarity and \r\ndetermination to weather that storm together. \r\n Mr. Olago Owuor (Kenya): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the African Group. The African \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 2 \r\n \r\nGroup associates itself with the statement to be made \r\nby the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China. The African Group is \r\nalso thankful to the Secretary-General for his \r\nsubmission of the two reports (A/63/206 and A/63/212) \r\nunder consideration under sub-items (a) and (b) of \r\nagenda item 57, entitled, respectively, “New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development: progress in \r\nimplementation and international support” and “Causes \r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa”, as well as for his \r\nnote (A/63/219) submitted under agenda item 43, \r\nentitled, “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa”. \r\nHowever, we wish to note that the world has changed \r\nsignificantly since the publication of those reports \r\nowing to dynamics in the global economy, particularly \r\nthe current financial crisis in developed countries. \r\n In that context, the African Group welcomed the \r\nadoption of the political declaration on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs by heads of State or Government \r\non 22 September 2008. The declaration is a clear \r\nundertaking at the highest political level to strengthen \r\nsupport for the implementation of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which is Africa’s \r\noverarching framework for sustainable socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. It is also important to point out that the \r\ndeclaration came at a time when all economic \r\nindicators showed that globalization and the global \r\npartnership for Africa’s development had yet to deliver \r\nAfrica’s poor from dehumanizing poverty and hunger. \r\n Furthermore, the international community \r\nundertook to reinvigorate and strengthen the global \r\npartnership of equals based on our common values, \r\nmutual accountability, shared responsibility and the \r\ndetermination to collectively act for our common \r\nfuture and to mobilize the resources required to \r\neradicate poverty, hunger and underdevelopment in \r\nAfrica. We believe that the main objective of that \r\nundertaking is to turn existing commitments into \r\nconcrete actions. \r\n It is important to see Africa’s development \r\nagainst the backdrop of the weakened global economy \r\nresulting from the energy crisis, food and oil price rises \r\nand the current financial crisis in developed countries. \r\nThey are contributing to the adverse impact on growth \r\nand the economic prospects of all African economies, \r\nwith the potential for severe consequences for the least \r\ndeveloped countries in the continent. \r\n The evident slowdown in global growth, the \r\ndanger posed by the current high commodity prices and \r\nthe possibility of entrenched long-term effects, the \r\ndiminished access to finance for investment and the \r\nerosion of the balance of payments positions of many \r\ncountries threaten to undermine the policy gains we \r\nhave made over the past decade. That is likely to push \r\nmillions across the African continent over the poverty \r\nline. \r\n In view of the foregoing, Africa’s growth is \r\nprojected to slow down in 2008. The growth outlook \r\nfor Africa may worsen if the global economy \r\nexperiences a protracted slowdown. It is therefore \r\nessential that the international community’s policy \r\nactions be aimed at supporting NEPAD’s objectives of \r\nimproving economic infrastructure and creating an \r\nenabling environment for investment and growth. \r\n Through NEPAD, African leaders have \r\ncommitted themselves to consolidating democracy and \r\ngood governance and to implementing sustainable \r\nsocio-economic development programmes. NEPAD \r\nadopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nas the centrepiece of Africa’s development agenda. The \r\nUnited Nations system as a whole is mandated to \r\ncoordinate programmes of action on the continent \r\nwithin the framework established by NEPAD. At the \r\ncountry level, the MDGs also inform the framework for \r\nnational policy and planning. The Africa Peer Review \r\nMechanism is being rolled out, providing a framework \r\nfor sharing best practices on the continent. Assistance \r\nand support from the donor community are important \r\nfor the long-term success of NEPAD. \r\n Recent reports suggest that Africa is off-track in \r\nmeeting the targets set by the MDGs. Africa’s \r\nachievement of the MDGs will require rising above \r\ncurrent crises and taking proactive action to \r\nsubstantially accelerate progress. There is an urgent \r\nneed to scale up support to African countries to enable \r\nthem to achieve the MDGs. Action is especially needed \r\nto identify precise areas of need in accordance with \r\nAfrica’s own development strategies. Commitments \r\nmust continue to be translated into concrete action, in \r\nparticular in the areas of development and poverty \r\neradication. In that respect the report of the MDG \r\nSteering Group provides recommendations on how the \r\nchallenges of achieving the MDGs can be met. \r\n We take note of the Secretary-General’s progress \r\nreport on the implementation of the recommendations \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n3 08-55210 \r\n \r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n(A/63/212). The causes of conflict in Africa are many. \r\nThey include extreme poverty, weak State institutions, \r\npoor management of natural resources, failure to \r\nprotect fundamental human rights and increased threats \r\nrelated to climate change. \r\n The African Union has pledged to address \r\nconflict and political instability in Africa, with the aim \r\nof achieving a conflict-free Africa by 2010. The \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council continues to \r\nplay an important role in the prevention and resolution \r\nof conflicts in the continent. We therefore welcome \r\nefforts by the United Nations to collaborate with the \r\nAfrican Union with a view to building and enhancing \r\nthe Union’s peacekeeping capacity. \r\n The African Union endeavours to address the \r\nchallenges facing member States emerging from \r\nconflict. Post-conflict reconstruction and development \r\nare among the tools of the African Union designed to \r\ncurb the severity and repeated nature of conflicts in \r\nAfrica and to bring about sustainable development. The \r\nAfrican Union’s post-conflict reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment also endeavour to complement the United \r\nNations Peacebuilding Commission’s work in \r\nidentifying States that are at risk of becoming failed \r\nStates by providing timely help to such States and \r\npeoples, and hence contribute towards lowering the \r\nrate at which war-torn countries may relapse into \r\nconflict. Post-conflict reconstruction and development \r\nstress the long-term nature of post-conflict \r\nreconstruction strategies that are established within and \r\nby communities and States themselves. \r\n The African Group commends the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for transmitting to the Assembly the \r\ncomprehensive report by the World Health \r\nOrganization on the efforts to contain and reverse the \r\nspread of malaria in Africa (A/63/219). Since the \r\nbeginning of the Decade to Roll Back Malaria, we have \r\nwitnessed significant progress by the international \r\ncommunity and African Governments themselves. The \r\npartnerships have been broadened and have involved \r\nall stakeholders and concerned communities. Special \r\nthanks go to development partners for their continued \r\nsupport in that regard. \r\n The United Nations, together with the \r\ninternational community, needs to display unequivocal \r\npolitical will to operationalize and implement the \r\ncommitments made to enhance the global partnership \r\nfor Africa’s development. It is important that, in \r\naccordance with the political declaration on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs, the United Nations should \r\nformulate, by the Assembly’s sixty-fifth session, a \r\nmonitoring mechanism to review the implementation \r\nof all commitments related to Africa’s development, \r\nbuilding on existing mechanisms, in order to ensure \r\nthat Member States continue to be seized with \r\naddressing Africa’s special needs. That is essential if \r\nthe United Nations is to fulfil its mandate to achieve an \r\nequitable, integrated, coordinated and comprehensive \r\napproach to the global partnership for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment to create a better life for the millions of \r\npeople in Africa. That is the least we can expect from \r\nthe United Nations, and indeed from all of us. \r\n Mr. Delacroix (France) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\n(EU). The candidate countries of Turkey and the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the potential \r\ncandidates and members of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia; and Ukraine, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Armenia and Georgia align themselves with \r\nthis statement.  \r\n As you have requested, Mr. President, my \r\nstatement will address both agenda item 57, regarding \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD), and agenda item 43, on the fight against \r\nmalaria, which primarily pertains to Africa.  \r\n Regarding Africa’s development, as underscored \r\nat the high-level meeting on Africa’s development \r\nneeds, which culminated in the political declaration \r\nadopted on 22 September (resolution 63/1), much \r\nprogress has been achieved, in terms of institutional \r\norganization, with the development of the African \r\nUnion, and in economic terms. Nevertheless, the \r\nchallenges that the continent still faces remain \r\nparticularly important. NEPAD, whose ambition is to \r\nprovide a road map for the renaissance of Africa, is, in \r\nour view, a key instrument. We are all committed to \r\ncontributing actively to its implementation in all its \r\ndimensions. \r\n The European Union welcomes the pace of \r\nreviews being carried out by the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism (APRM). The follow-up to the \r\nimplementation of action plans developed subsequent \r\nto those reviews is of major importance; it will be at \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 4 \r\n \r\nthe core of the Africa-EU Partnership on Democratic \r\nGovernance and Human Rights. The concept of equal \r\nrights should allow women to participate fully in all \r\naspects of economic, social and political life. In that \r\nregard, the European Union supports the current \r\nAfrican Union efforts to protect the rights of women \r\nand takes note of the proposals submitted by the \r\nNEPAD Gender Task Force, which aim to bring about a \r\nnumber of changes to the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism. \r\n NEPAD is also called to reinforce its action, by \r\nmeans of regional integration initiatives, to promote \r\nAfrica’s economic and social development, alongside \r\nsecurity and good governance. The European Union \r\nhas noted the progress, highlighted in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/63/206), that, with the support of \r\nthe international community, has been achieved at \r\nnational and regional levels in numerous areas, \r\nincluding infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, \r\ntraining, the environment, information and \r\ncommunication technologies, science and technology, \r\ngender equality, participation by civil society, and the \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism. The European \r\nUnion, in the spirit of partnership, will remain firmly \r\ncommitted to the implementation of NEPAD. \r\n The European Union supports the ongoing efforts \r\nto strengthen the cooperation between NEPAD and the \r\nAfrican Union. Inter-institutional cooperation is very \r\nimportant among regional organizations, especially \r\nbetween the Commission of the African Union and \r\nNEPAD. The European Union notes with great interest \r\nand supports the actions undertaken on 10 June in \r\nAddis Ababa by Mr. Jean Ping, Chairperson of the \r\nCommission of the African Union, with a view to \r\nbetter integration between the African Union and \r\nNEPAD. The current crises and climate change make \r\nconsistency in actions between NEPAD and the African \r\nUnion particularly necessary. Finally, the European \r\nUnion encourages NEPAD to step up its efforts to \r\ncombat HIV/AIDS. \r\n The European Union is fully and unambiguously \r\ncommitted to stand by the African continent, as \r\ndemonstrated by the adoption of the Joint EU-Africa \r\nStrategy in Lisbon in December 2007. Today the \r\nimplementation of that strategy is actively pursued in \r\nall areas. The European Union is Africa’s principal \r\ndevelopment partner. Sixty-two per cent of bilateral aid \r\nallocated at the regional level by the European Union \r\nwent to Africa, and the European Union has reaffirmed \r\nits complete commitment to Africa.  \r\n As stressed in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\ndocument (resolution 60/1), development, human rights \r\nand peace and security are inextricably linked and \r\ninseparable. The search for peace on the African \r\ncontinent is therefore another of the European Union’s \r\npriorities, as demonstrated by its commitment to help \r\nin the prevention and resolution of conflicts, \r\npeacekeeping and reconstruction. Under the framework \r\nof the African Peace Facility, €250 million were \r\ntransferred to support the African peace and security \r\narchitecture between 2005 and 2007. The European \r\nUnion has promised an additional €300 million for the \r\nperiod from 2008 to 2010. The European Union is also \r\nready to help Africa through the European Union force \r\n(EUFOR). \r\n The recent adoption of resolution 62/275, on the \r\ncauses of conflicts and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa, has enabled \r\nprogress. The European Union remains committed to \r\ndealing with the causes of conflict and contributing to \r\na lasting peace in Africa.  \r\n I would now like to focus my observations on \r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa. At \r\npresent, malaria affects approximately 40 per cent of \r\nthe world’s population, and Africa is particularly hard \r\nhit. Of the 105 countries afflicted by this scourge, \r\n45 are in Africa. It is first and foremost a human \r\ntragedy, causing more than 800,000 deaths each year, \r\n91 per cent of which are in Africa. It is the leading \r\ncause of death among young children in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica. But the consequences of this epidemic go well \r\nbeyond that; it is a handicap for the development and \r\nstability of the continent. It is estimated that \r\n$12 billion of the African gross domestic product is \r\nlost annually to malaria. The fight against malaria must \r\ntherefore be considered a global emergency in order to \r\ndefeat poverty. \r\n The report transmitted by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/63/219) gives reason for hope, as it highlights the \r\nprogress made in eradicating the disease. A net \r\nreduction in malaria has been recorded in certain \r\ncountries and regions, sometimes as much as \r\n50 per cent. Those reductions have been seen in \r\nEritrea, Rwanda, South Africa, Namibia, Swaziland \r\nand Zanzibar. This is evidence that a strategy \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n5 08-55210 \r\n \r\ncombining anti-vector measures, particularly the use of \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets, and the use of \r\ntreatments is effective and produces visible and lasting \r\nresults.  \r\n The European Union is aware of the logistical \r\nand, above all, economic obstacles that often confront \r\ncountries in the implementation of those measures. The \r\nEuropean Union strongly supports the activities of the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \r\nand UNITAID — the International Drug Purchase \r\nFacility — which have enabled considerable progress \r\nin the provision of long-lasting insecticide-treated \r\nmosquito nets and ACT, artemisinin-based combination \r\ntherapy. Contributions from the countries of the \r\nEuropean Union and the European Commission \r\naccount for 60 per cent of the Global Fund. The \r\nEuropean Union would like to pay tribute to the role of \r\nthe Roll Back Malaria Partnership, which is essential to \r\nthe coordination of international action against malaria. \r\n The European Union is fully committed to the \r\nfight against the scourge of malaria and determined to \r\ncontinue its efforts. The results observed in certain \r\ncountries demonstrate that the eradication of the \r\npandemic is within our reach. We can attain \r\nMillennium Development Goal 6 of controlling malaria \r\nand reversing current trends between now and 2015. To \r\nachieve that, mobilization must be global, bringing \r\ntogether Governments, international organizations, the \r\nprivate sector and civil society. We must continue our \r\nefforts. Our attention should be focused on vulnerable \r\npopulations and in particular on children and pregnant \r\nwomen, on whom the continent’s future depends. \r\n Mr. Pramudwinai (Thailand): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the member States of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, \r\nthe Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. \r\n Africa’s challenge is the world’s challenge. The \r\nsuccessful development of Africa, with its total \r\npopulation of over 920 million people, will be a \r\nsuccess for us all. Now is the critical time for the \r\ndevelopment of Africa. We are standing at the midpoint \r\nfor the realization of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Only seven years are left before the \r\n2015 MDG deadline, but the challenges ahead are still \r\ndaunting. According to the Secretary-General’s reports \r\non the subject, despite strong overall economic \r\nperformances recently in many African countries, not \r\none is on track to achieve all of the MDGs. Food, oil \r\nand financial crises, climate change, unfulfilled official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) commitments and the \r\nstalled Doha Round have undermined their \r\ndevelopment efforts. \r\n There is still hope, however. Thanks to the \r\nleadership and resolve of African leaders and their \r\npeoples, there are clear signs of progress. The \r\ninternational community must build on those positive \r\ndevelopments and redouble its efforts to help African \r\ncountries tackle the formidable challenges they are \r\nfacing. The United Nations and its relevant agencies \r\ncan play a greater role in that endeavour. \r\n The emphasis for the international community \r\nshould be on forging and strengthening partnership for \r\nmutual benefit rather than on creating dependence. \r\nThus, Africa’s determination to be in charge of its own \r\ndevelopment and to work with development partners in \r\nan atmosphere of respect and equality — as embodied \r\nin the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) — should be given strong support.  \r\n The Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) supports the determination to implement \r\nNEPAD. ASEAN supports NEPAD because it \r\nmobilizes and strengthens cooperation among regional \r\norganizations. That synergy has the potential to \r\ngenerate positive and dynamic development outcomes. \r\nASEAN will also continue to support NEPAD as a \r\ncoherent and concerted framework for engaging \r\nAfrica’s development issues. As part of that thrust, \r\nASEAN urges the international community to build on \r\nthe momentum created by the recent high-level \r\nmeeting to address Africa’s development needs, held \r\non 22 September 2008 in New York. The political \r\ndeclaration adopted at the end of that meeting has all \r\nthe answers on how best to respond effectively to \r\nAfrica’s development needs. All that is needed is for us \r\nto honour commitments already made and to turn \r\nwords into deeds. In that context, ASEAN welcomes \r\nthe mechanism formulated at the high-level meeting to \r\nreview the full and timely implementation of all \r\ncommitments related to Africa’s development needs. \r\n Asia’s strong support for Africa’s development \r\nshould come as no surprise since we have a long \r\nhistory of fraternity between us. The first Asia-Africa \r\nsummit was held in Bandung, Indonesia, and gave birth \r\nto the “Bandung Spirit” of solidarity, friendship and \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 6 \r\n \r\ncooperation between Asia and Africa. The Spirit was \r\nreaffirmed by the participation of then-President Thabo \r\nMbeki of South Africa on behalf of the African Union \r\nat the eighth ASEAN summit in Phnom Penh, \r\nCambodia, in November 2002. At that meeting, \r\nPresident Mbeki not only recalled the historical roots \r\nof cooperation between Asia and Africa, but also \r\ncommended ASEAN for its South-South cooperation \r\nprogrammes. \r\n The bonds of fraternity are strong because \r\nASEAN leaders recognize that they share much \r\ncommon ground with African aspirations. On that \r\nbasis, they acknowledge the need for greater \r\ninteraction between ASEAN and the African Union. \r\nLeaders also agreed to take steps to promote stronger \r\nties between Asia and Africa, including by convening \r\nan ASEAN-NEPAD conference. That desire took on \r\nthe form of a process activated by the Asia-Africa \r\nSubregional Organizations Conference. The process \r\nwas initiated in Bandung, Indonesia, in 2003. The \r\nsecond Conference was held in Durban, South Africa, \r\nin 2004. \r\n In 2005, the Asia-Africa summit held in Bandung \r\nto mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Bandung Spirit \r\nlaunched the New Asia-Africa Strategic Partnership. \r\nThe Partnership is rooted within a framework calling \r\nfor political solidarity, economic cooperation and \r\nimproved sociocultural relations. As an expression of \r\ncollaboration between southern countries, it should \r\nenjoy the full support of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme’s Special Unit for South-\r\nSouth Cooperation. \r\n While African countries are forging closer ties \r\namong themselves, ASEAN is also transforming itself \r\ninto a rules-based, people-oriented community \r\ndesigned to integrate South-East Asia. In that process, \r\nASEAN will continue to function as an outward-\r\nlooking organization with an agenda stressing \r\nbeneficial global partnerships, including close working \r\nrelationships with Africa. \r\n A strong foundation has already been laid for \r\nsuch ties with Africa. ASEAN countries have paved the \r\nway through many partnership projects with African \r\ncountries. Today, policymakers, development actors \r\nand experts in various fields from ASEAN countries \r\nare working hand in hand with their counterparts in \r\nmany African countries in areas such as human \r\nresources development, capacity-building, public \r\nhealth, infectious diseases, food security, fisheries and \r\nagricultural development. \r\n ASEAN is keen to explore other avenues of \r\npartnership with Africa. As developing countries \r\nourselves, ASEAN countries understand the nature of \r\nthe challenges facing African countries. We are \r\ntherefore willing to share with our African partners the \r\nexperiences and lessons we have learned in tackling \r\ndevelopment challenges, many of which resemble \r\ndevelopment challenges that African countries are \r\ncurrently facing. Other forms of partnership, such as \r\ntrilateral partnership, should also be further encouraged \r\nto maximize the synergetic potential of partnership \r\nbetween ASEAN, Africa and donor countries in \r\nresponse to Africa’s development needs. \r\n ASEAN believes that the sound and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of any country or region requires a \r\nfavourable international environment if it is to succeed. \r\nThe development of Africa is no exception. That is \r\nwhy ASEAN has been following the gathering global \r\nfinancial storm very closely. We ASEAN countries \r\nlearned through our own painful experience in the \r\n1990s that a major financial crisis can spawn multiple \r\ncrises with far-reaching consequences for the \r\ndevelopment of nations near and far. Therefore, \r\nASEAN calls upon all parties concerned to work \r\ntogether to arrest the current downward spiral and \r\nprevent panic in the world economy. \r\n ASEAN urges its development partners to take \r\nsteps to ensure that the current crisis in the world \r\nfinancial market does not adversely impact \r\ndevelopment partnerships or hinder assistance for \r\ndeveloping countries, including in Africa. Donors \r\nshould not let the current financial crisis distract them \r\nfrom their commitments to scale up and reverse the \r\ndecline in ODA disbursement in the next few years. \r\nSteps should also be taken to improve the effectiveness \r\nof ODA in support of the national development \r\nstrategies adopted by African countries. \r\n ASEAN believes that integral to international \r\ndevelopment cooperation is the operation of an open \r\nand fair global trading system. The need for such a \r\nsystem has never been greater or more urgent, \r\nespecially in the area of agricultural commodities. \r\nThose products make up the main exports of \r\ndeveloping countries in Asia, Africa and other parts of \r\nthe world. We therefore call on all parties concerned \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n7 08-55210 \r\n \r\nnot only to promptly resume the Doha Round, but also \r\nto conclude it. \r\n Now is the time for each of us to show leadership \r\nand for all of us to provide collective leadership. We all \r\nknow what is required for Africa to achieve the MDGs: \r\nall we need to do is work together to make it happen. \r\nASEAN is ready to do so and looks forward to \r\nstrengthening its partnership with Africa in all areas of \r\nmutual benefit. \r\n Mr. Talbot (Guyana): As this is the first \r\nstatement to be made on behalf of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) in the plenary of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session, permit me to \r\nconvey to you, Sir, the felicitations of all of \r\nCARICOM on your election to guide the important \r\ndeliberations of this session and to express to you our \r\nbest wishes for a successful tenure. \r\n I am especially pleased to address the theme of \r\ntoday’s debate — the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) — on behalf of the 14 States \r\nmembers of CARICOM that are Members of this \r\nOrganization. The Caribbean is umbilically linked to \r\nthe African continent by strong bonds. It is a link \r\nestablished through the horrors of the Middle Passage, \r\nnurtured in the struggle against colonialism and \r\napartheid, and today sustained by a sense of shared \r\npurpose and common destiny. CARICOM is pleased to \r\nrenew its solidarity with Africa’s quest for durable \r\npeace, sustainable development, the strengthening of \r\ndemocracy and the guarantee of full enjoyment by all \r\nits citizens of their human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. \r\n The high-level meeting on Africa’s development \r\nneeds, held on 22 September 2008, took account of the \r\nstate of implementation of various commitments, the \r\nchallenges encountered and the way forward, and \r\nadopted a Political Declaration (resolution 63/1). That \r\nmeeting, having followed others including the Fourth \r\nTokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment, sustained the considerable attention that \r\nthe international community has rightly been devoting \r\nto Africa.  \r\n Africa and its partners have taken several actions \r\nto ensure progress in the implementation of national \r\nand subregional development plans and strategies. \r\nMost notably, however, Africa’s response is \r\ncrystallized and coordinated within the ambit of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development, which is \r\nthe continent’s overarching framework for socio-\r\neconomic development. CARICOM has observed with \r\nmuch interest the steps that have been taken to \r\nimplement that strategic framework for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Africa’s quest is beset by myriad challenges, \r\nincluding those related to inadequate infrastructure and \r\nindustrialization and to a lack of requisite human and \r\ninstitutional capacities. The continent needs to see \r\nsubstantially increased investments in those areas if it \r\nis to ensure a firm basis for sustained growth and \r\nsustainable development. As the report of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) Africa \r\nSteering Group notes, the region has grown by some \r\n3.6 per cent per year during periods of accelerated \r\ngrowth but, conversely, has shrunk by 2.7 per cent \r\nduring periods of growth collapse. In addition, growth \r\nvolatility in sub-Saharan Africa is some five times \r\nhigher than that observed in low- and middle-income \r\ncountries generally, as shown by the coefficient of \r\nvariation of GDP growth per capita. CARICOM \r\ntherefore underscores the urgency of finding solutions \r\nto Africa’s major challenges. \r\n Africa will no doubt feel some of the effects of \r\nthe current financial crisis, which has cast a pall over \r\nthe prospects of the world economy. Its traditional \r\nmarkets are at stake. And the threat of a further cutback \r\nin official development assistance (ODA) is now a real \r\nprospect as many developed countries struggle to \r\nsafeguard their financial and banking systems from \r\ncollapse. The crisis now serves to poignantly \r\nunderscore our global and mutual interdependence. In \r\nthe wake of the food crisis and high oil prices, the \r\nfinancial crisis is also a stark reminder that the policies \r\nof systemically important countries have serious \r\nimpact on the fortunes of States far and wide, not least \r\nthose of the African continent. \r\n A special responsibility therefore devolves on \r\ndeveloped countries to ensure that their policies, both \r\ndomestic and foreign, contribute to peace, stability and \r\nprosperity in the world. In our view, that entails greater \r\ncoherence across various policy domains, including in \r\nfinancial, trade, development and environmental \r\npolicies. CARICOM underscores that, as expressed in \r\nthe 22 September Declaration, all commitments to and \r\nby Africa to comprehensively address the special \r\ndevelopment needs of the continent should be \r\neffectively implemented and given appropriate follow-\r\nup by the international community and by Africa itself. \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 8 \r\n \r\n While Africa is not currently on track to achieve \r\nthe 2015 MDG targets, it is also evident that, at current \r\nrates, the commitment to double aid to Africa by 2010, \r\nas articulated at the Group of Eight Summit in \r\nGleneagles, will also not be fulfilled. Although the \r\ninternational community has provided support for \r\nAfrica’s development, that assistance needs to be \r\nsubstantially increased and made more effective. In \r\nsome cases, support programmes have not been \r\nadequately tailored to the needs and specificities of \r\nindividual African countries. It is therefore essential \r\nthat all ODA-related commitments by developed \r\ncountries be fulfilled to improve the prospects for \r\nachieving the MDGs in Africa. \r\n Considerable gains are possible if the \r\ninternational community translates its many \r\ncommitments into actions. Africa’s debt sustainability \r\nchallenges must also be tackled coherently and its \r\ninternational trade facilitated and promoted, including \r\nthrough regional integration, greater integration into \r\nthe global economy and the fulfilment of our global \r\ncommitment to a well-functioning, rules-based, open, \r\nnon-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading \r\nsystem that is supportive of sustainable development. \r\nIn addition, given the importance of agriculture in the \r\ndevelopment of the continent and in order to cope with \r\nthe current food crisis, African countries should strive \r\nto meet the Maputo Declaration target of devoting \r\n10 per cent of public expenditure to agricultural and \r\nrural development in initiating a green African \r\nrevolution and should be strongly supported by the \r\ninternational community in that endeavour.  \r\n Indeed, Africa continues to face formidable \r\nchallenges in consolidating the basic conditions for \r\npeace and development. CARICOM applauds Africa’s \r\nsuccesses in that area, even as we observe its setbacks \r\nwith concern, conscious of the devastating human and \r\neconomic toll of armed conflict and absolute poverty. \r\nGreater attention must therefore be focused on \r\neliminating the combination of internal and external \r\nfactors that engender conflict and stymie development. \r\nWe also support Africa’s efforts to improve both \r\neconomic and political governance and to strengthen \r\nmechanisms for the participation, inclusion and \r\nempowerment of all segments of society — including \r\ncivil society, women and girls, communities and \r\nhouseholds — in political and development processes. \r\nLike Africa, CARICOM believes that good governance \r\nprovides the foundation for peace, security and \r\nprosperity. In that context, we have noted with interest \r\nthe design and implementation of the Peer Review \r\nMechanism as a worthy instrument in that regard. \r\n Perhaps the most salient of the lessons learned \r\nfrom the high-level meeting on Africa’s development, \r\nheld in September, was the recognition that Africa is \r\ncapable of, and has dedicated much effort to, resolving \r\nthe challenges it faces. Nonetheless, those endeavours \r\nmust be supported and complemented by efforts on the \r\npart of the international community.  \r\n The Africa Steering Group report makes clear \r\nthat the full implementation of appropriate policies can \r\nproduce verifiable development results that can help to \r\nensure the effective use of domestic and external \r\nresources and, inter alia, lay the foundation for robust \r\neconomic growth. Africa provides a barometre of \r\noverall development progress. The international \r\ncommunity must utilize it is as a window of \r\nopportunity. \r\n In that regard, success stories on the achievement \r\ntowards individual Goals across a range of countries \r\nshow that rapid progress can be made when sound \r\ndomestic policies are matched with substantial \r\ntechnical and financial support from the international \r\ncommunity. CARICOM applauds the leadership shown \r\nby African countries in addressing their major \r\nchallenges and in charting the way forward for the \r\nregion in the context of the African Union, as well as \r\nthrough other national and subregional approaches. \r\n CARICOM has followed with great interest the \r\ncreative efforts of the African Union in the \r\ndevelopment of new institutional arrangements. Those \r\nefforts are geared to accelerate integration on the \r\ncontinent in order to enable Africa to better take its \r\nrightful place in the world and to strengthen relations \r\nwith its diaspora. As shown by the visit of an East \r\nAfrican delegation to the CARICOM secretariat just \r\nlast week, there is much scope for exchanges of our \r\ndevelopment and other experience in the ambit of \r\nSouth-South cooperation. \r\n In closing, CARICOM calls on the international \r\ncommunity to significantly enhance its support for \r\nAfrica’s development through NEPAD. We also look \r\nforward to working with our brothers and sisters of \r\nAfrica to further strengthen institutional mechanisms \r\nfor collaboration between Africa and the Caribbean in \r\nsupport of mutual development objectives. Africa will \r\never find in CARICOM a staunch supporter for the \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n9 08-55210 \r\n \r\ncontinued progress of Africa and the full \r\nimplementation of its aspirations. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana): Ghana associates itself \r\nwith the statement made on behalf of the African \r\nGroup and the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The Secretary-General has appropriately \r\ndescribed the development challenges of Africa as a \r\ndevelopment emergency. We are aware that the basic \r\nconditions required for sustained peace and \r\ndevelopment have yet to be adequately consolidated on \r\nthe continent. Poverty, weak State institutions, poor \r\nmanagement of natural resources, the failure to protect \r\nhuman rights and threats related to climate change are \r\nstill persistent. \r\n The Constitutive Act of the African Union \r\nacknowledges that conflicts in Africa constitute a \r\nmajor impediment to its socio-economic development. \r\nIn addition to unfortunate historical legacies, African \r\nleaders have also come to terms with the fact that the \r\nimpoverishment of the continent has been partly due to \r\nshortcomings in the policies pursued by many \r\ncountries in the post-independence era. \r\n This was the state of affairs on the continent \r\nwhen the Secretary-General wrote his seminal report \r\n“The causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa” \r\n(A/52/871). Considerable progress has been made since \r\nthat report first appeared in 1998. Today, the number of \r\nAfrican countries afflicted by conflicts is fewer than it \r\nwas a decade ago. The improved institutional \r\neffectiveness in responding to conflict through \r\npeacekeeping, especially by Africans themselves, has \r\nbeen a major factor in containing violent conflicts on \r\nthe continent. \r\n The new generation of African leaders, in their \r\ndetermination to change course, adopted the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as a \r\nstrategic development framework to address the many \r\ndevelopment challenges facing the continent and its \r\npopulations. NEPAD establishes the conditions for \r\nsustainable development by ensuring peace and \r\nsecurity, building democracy and good governance, \r\nengendering policy reforms and increased investments \r\nin priority sectors, and mobilizing resources for \r\ndevelopment. Furthermore, the leaders have committed \r\nthemselves to actively promoting human rights, the \r\nrule of law and the consolidation of democracy by, for \r\ninstance, subscribing to the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism. \r\n However, as African countries embark on that \r\njourney, they continue to face daunting challenges that \r\nare beyond their control. Factors such as the current \r\nglobal financial crisis, the stalled Doha Development \r\nRound of trade negotiations and a general lack of a \r\nconducive international economic environment \r\ncontinue to impede Africa’s development efforts both \r\ndirectly and indirectly. \r\n Many African countries have pledged to increase \r\ntheir health budgets to 15 per cent of public \r\nexpenditure so as to fight diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, but \r\nto date, only a few countries have reached that goal. \r\nThat is because the chronic financial and institutional \r\nconstraints facing most African countries have been \r\naggravated by the brain drain that has resulted in the \r\nalready few doctors, nurses and other health \r\nprofessionals, trained with meagre resources, leaving \r\nin droves in search of better conditions of service \r\nabroad. The brain drain has also affected professionals \r\nand skilled personnel in other sectors of the economy, \r\nthereby depriving the affected countries of much-\r\nneeded human capital for development. \r\n In the area of education, Ghana finds it \r\nunacceptable that currently over 1.4 million Ghanaian \r\nchildren do not go to school. To redress the situation, \r\nthe Government is making heavy investments at all \r\nlevels of the country’s education system. For instance, \r\nGhana launched educational reforms to put the country \r\nin a better position to achieve the targets under \r\nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) 2. A cornerstone \r\nof the reforms is the introduction of a free and \r\ncompulsory universal basic education from \r\nkindergarten through primary school to junior high \r\nschool. \r\n We are using various mechanisms, such as a \r\ncapitation grant and school feeding programme, to \r\nboost enrolment. Special attention is paid to girls’ \r\neducation and, on the average, the rate of enrolment of \r\nthe girl child has surpassed her male counterpart. To \r\nattain its goals and achieve quality education, the \r\nGovernment is working tirelessly to improve the \r\nconditions of service of Ghanaian teachers, including \r\nretraining and upgrading their professional skills, in \r\naddition to appreciable increases in the levels of their \r\nremuneration. \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 10 \r\n \r\n So far, the results of our efforts have been mixed. \r\nThere is still resistance to enrolment due, among other \r\nthings, to cultural and economic factors. There are \r\nwide disparities in access to education between the \r\nvarious regions and also between urban and rural areas. \r\nThe uneven distribution of access appears to have been \r\naggravated by our high birth rate as well as by rapid \r\nurbanization. We are also faced with the challenges of \r\ninadequate and obsolete training facilities, poor \r\nlogistics and a host of other problems. \r\n Despite existing challenges in the health sector, \r\nGhana continues to strive to meet the targets in MDGs \r\n4, 5 and 6. Through the National Health Insurance \r\nScheme, which has taken off and is still being \r\nimproved, the Government aims to increase public \r\naccess to health care, improve the quality and \r\nefficiency of health care delivery, as well as improve \r\nand increase programmes of education on curative and \r\npreventive health-care. Ghana has also managed to \r\ninstitute free medical care for expectant women to \r\nencourage more women to make use of modern \r\nmedical facilities, reduce their exposure to unqualified \r\ntraditional birth attendants and thereby promote overall \r\nreproductive health. \r\n Although our efforts have resulted in some \r\nappreciable reduction in child mortality, Ghana will not \r\nfind it easy to meet the targeted rate of reduction by \r\n2015 due to the limited access to health facilities, \r\nincluding the wide doctor-patient ratio and the general \r\nproblem of retaining health personnel that the nation \r\nhas been facing for some time now. \r\n We are counting on the continued support of our \r\ndevelopment partners to meet the shortfalls in funds for \r\nthe education and health sectors, which have far \r\nreaching impacts on the other MDGs. The Government \r\nis working with agencies such as UNESCO, UNICEF, \r\nthe World Health Organization, the United Kingdom’s \r\nDepartment for International Development, and the \r\nUnited States Agency for International Development, \r\namong other bilateral partners, to complement its \r\nefforts. \r\n Malaria remains one of the deadliest diseases in \r\nAfrica, killing more than 1 million people each year, \r\nmostly children and pregnant women. Although the \r\ndisease is widespread, it does not enjoy the high profile \r\nvisibility of other issues of similar scale and impact. In \r\nGhana, malaria is prevalent throughout the country and \r\nis responsible for over 40 per cent of outpatient visits \r\nand approximately 20 per cent of deaths in children \r\nunder five years. \r\n In recent years, several African countries have \r\nmade commitments to bringing malaria under control. \r\nIn 2000, 44 African leaders signed the Abuja \r\nDeclaration committing their countries to work towards \r\na 50 per cent decrease in malaria deaths in Africa by \r\n2010. Those efforts have been supported by \r\ndevelopment partners through such programmes as the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \r\nand the President’s Malaria Initiative launched by the \r\nUnited States Government to provide financial \r\nresources to African countries to fight malaria. A recent \r\nUnited Nations report confirmed that more African \r\nchildren were getting insecticide-treated bednets and \r\nbeing treated for malaria. \r\n There is concern, nonetheless, that most African \r\nnations remain off track in reaching the goal of halting \r\nand reversing the incidence of the disease. It is in that \r\nlight that we laud the initiative of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon to end malaria deaths by 2010. The \r\ninitiative is a bold but achievable one, given the \r\nnecessary leadership, commitment and will to fight \r\nmalaria. It is imperative that we work together to \r\nrealize the vision. Eliminating malaria deaths will \r\nremove a major barrier to economic development and \r\nprovide significant momentum towards reaching at \r\nleast four of the MDGs. We are already midway to the \r\n2015 deadline set for the achievement of the MDGs. \r\nTherefore, the urgency of the Secretary–General’s call \r\nto action cannot be overstated. \r\n  Mr. Salgueiro (Portugal), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n Africa is endowed with natural resources that \r\nrepresent a vast potential that can be harnessed for the \r\ncontinent’s development. We recognize that, with the \r\nright combination of sound domestic policies and the \r\ntimely fulfilment of long-standing pledges of support, \r\nthe story of the Continent could be different in 2015. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The gradual socio-economic development of \r\nthe African Continent is necessary to effectively \r\naddress global threats and challenges, including in the \r\narea of security. Russia fully supports the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to turn Africa into a zone of \r\nactive partnership and to establish conditions on the \r\ncontinent conducive to peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We are firmly committed to meeting \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n11 08-55210 \r\n \r\ninternational obligations to assist Africa, especially \r\nwith respect to the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the implementation \r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD).  \r\n We are grateful to the Secretary-General for the \r\nsubstantial reports on the achievements of NEPAD \r\n(A/63/206 and A/63/212) and will continue to view that \r\ninitiative as a main channel for the countries of the \r\ncontinent in attaining the MDGs. NEPAD is universally \r\nrecognized as a platform for interaction with Africa \r\nand an important reference point for the international \r\ncommunity’s consideration of international assistance \r\nto the continent in the framework of the United \r\nNations, the Group of Eight and its Africa Partnership \r\nForum. \r\n Russia welcomed the holding on 22 September of \r\nthe General Assembly’s high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs. The political declaration adopted \r\nat the meeting reflects the resolve of Member States to \r\nstrengthen and intensify international cooperation to \r\nfind a long-term solution to Africa’s development \r\nneeds. The priority task now is for all countries to \r\neffectively honour the commitments they have \r\nundertaken. \r\n As the meeting confirmed yet again, the African \r\ncontinent requires the special attention of the \r\ninternational community in the context of attaining the \r\nMDGs. We welcome the commitment of leaders of \r\nAfrican countries to attaining the MDGs. We note the \r\nprogress in a number of areas, such as the positive \r\nmomentum towards achieving children’s access to \r\nbasic education in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same \r\ntime, there is a serious lag in attaining the MDGs in \r\nsuch areas as the reduction of mother and child \r\nmortality rates, the eradication of HIV/AIDS, \r\nguaranteed health care and others. \r\n Russia has consistently favoured a global \r\npartnership in the interest of creating reliable \r\nmechanisms for sustainable development on the \r\ncontinent and of strengthening regional stability. \r\nMeeting the special needs of Africa, especially helping \r\nto overcome poverty, is a priority of Russian \r\ninternational development policies. For many decades, \r\nour country, prompted by the principles of solidarity \r\nand equal partnership, has provided considerable \r\nassistance to African States. Our help has allowed a \r\nnumber of states to resolve serious economic problems \r\nand to lay the basis for subsequent industrialization. As \r\na responsible development partner, Russia is actively \r\nreviving its donor potential and will continue to make a \r\nsignificant contribution to the international efforts to \r\nrender comprehensive assistance to Africa.  \r\n We are playing a leadership role in debt write-\r\noffs to the countries of the continent. In the past two \r\nyears alone, Russia has cancelled African debts to the \r\ntune of $10 billion, almost double the general total of \r\ncancellations. At the same time, we are increasing our \r\ncontributions to international development programmes. \r\nWe have voluntarily contributed a total of $40 million \r\nto the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria. Our country has set aside $20 million to fight \r\nmalaria and $18 million to eradicate polio once and for \r\nall. Most of that assistance has been directed to the \r\nAfrican continent.  \r\n A key task at this stage is to encourage \r\ninvestment in the infrastructure of African countries, \r\nespecially in the cross-border context. With our help, \r\nAfrica is carrying out a number of investment projects. \r\nMajor Russian companies are working in Angola, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Guinea, Nigeria, Gabon, South Africa, \r\nAlgeria, Libya and Egypt. A very useful mechanism in \r\nsupport of investment, entrepreneurial investment and \r\ninnovative activities in Africa is the NEPAD Africa \r\nFund to finance measures to improve the investment \r\nclimate. It also serves to encourage investment in \r\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises and to develop \r\nthe microfinancing system.  \r\n Russia supported the initiative to form \r\npartnerships to enhance the efficiency of Africa’s \r\nfinancial sector. Among the priority areas of \r\ncooperation are the diversification of and expansion of \r\naccess to financial services for the poor, and increasing \r\nthe transparency and absorptive capacities of recipient \r\nGovernments. \r\n The problem of hunger and providing food \r\nremains one of the main socio-economic challenges \r\nfacing almost all the countries of the continent. We feel \r\nthat the Rome Declaration and the Comprehensive \r\nFramework for Action prepared by the High-Level \r\nTask Force on the Global Food Security Crisis can \r\nserve as a solid basis for strengthening the efforts of \r\nthe international community in that area.  \r\n In terms of the global food crisis, it is more \r\nimportant than ever to adopt measures to enhance \r\nAfrican agriculture on the basis of three key activities: \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 12 \r\n \r\nthe selection of more efficient crops; the expansion and \r\nimprovement of irrigation; and the active introduction \r\nof modern agricultural technology and the rational use \r\nof chemical fertilizers. Support for such work comes \r\nfrom national initiatives and the NEPAD/African \r\nUnion Comprehensive African Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme.  \r\n Another key issue in providing for a prosperous \r\nfuture for the African continent is the settlement and \r\nprevention of armed conflict. We are convinced that, in \r\norder to provide more stable peace on the continent, it \r\nis necessary first and foremost for the Africans \r\nthemselves to take active positions. We welcome the \r\nactive work of the African Union to create an African \r\nstandby force and early warning systems. We also \r\nwelcome the dialogue between the Security Council \r\nand the Peace and Security Council of the African \r\nUnion on resolving acute crisis situations. \r\n It is important to adopt measures to counter \r\nillegal armed formations, promote good-neighbourly \r\nrelations, strengthen cooperation on border security, \r\nseal borders against the spread of conflicts and the \r\ntransfer of weapons and mercenaries, and end the gross \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and \r\nimpunity for crimes against humanity. \r\n As a permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nRussia is making a significant contribution to the \r\ninternational community’s development of policies and \r\npractical measures on issues related to the \r\nstrengthening of peace and security in the region. We \r\nparticipate in all United Nations operations in Africa. \r\nWe have recently expanded training for African \r\npeacebuilding troops and law enforcement officers. \r\nThis year, through the specialized training institutions \r\nof the Ministry of the Interior, we plan to train \r\n350 staff members of African interior ministries.  \r\n Seeking to strengthen the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping potential and to assist African countries \r\nin post-conflict stabilization, as of this year the Russian \r\nFederation has decided to make annual contributions of \r\n$2 million to the Peacebuilding Fund.  \r\n We shall continue to work purposefully to put in \r\nplace effective sustainable development models in \r\nAfrica while strengthening regional stability and \r\nhelping a number of countries in numerous areas to \r\nsolve other urgent problems facing the continent. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): This \r\nyear, the General Assembly’s consideration of items \r\nrelating to peace and development in Africa is taking \r\nplace against the particular backdrop of the \r\ninternational community’s growing interest in crucial \r\nquestions relating to the African continent and the \r\nworld’s current economic and financial situation. On \r\n22 September 2008, the General Assembly held a \r\ntimely high-level meeting on the theme “Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs: state of implementation of various \r\ncommitments, challenges and the way forward”. That \r\nevent was an opportunity to focus the international \r\ncommunity’s attention on Africa’s problems and once \r\nagain to address the problems of and impediments to \r\nAfrica’s genuine social and economic development. It \r\nwas also an opportunity for representatives of the \r\ninternational community, and especially those of \r\ndeveloped countries, to renew their commitment to \r\nproviding the necessary support to Africa. \r\n The General Assembly also addressed the \r\nparticular situation of the African continent in that \r\nregard during the high-level meeting on the midterm \r\nreview of the progress made in the implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). On that \r\noccasion, it was clearly recognized that, if nothing \r\nchanges fundamentally between now and 2015, at the \r\ncurrent pace most African countries will not achieve \r\nthe Goals by the target date.  \r\n Moreover, this year’s debate is taking place in an \r\ninternational environment characterized by the \r\nmultifaceted financial, energy, food and climate crises \r\nbeing experienced throughout the world. Africa \r\nappears to have been doubly penalized by those crises. \r\nOn the one hand, it is the continent least prepared to \r\ndeal with them, due to the overall level of the \r\ncontinent’s development; on the other, it is at risk of \r\nsuffering negative repercussions in terms of the level \r\nof development assistance provided to Africa.  \r\n Algeria, which was among the first African \r\ncountries to promote the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), would like to emphasize both \r\nthe importance of that innovative framework and the \r\nnew tool it offers the continent for dealing with its \r\nforeign partners. Following the many laudable but \r\nstructurally deficient initiatives launched since the \r\n1980s, NEPAD has brought to bear an innovative \r\napproach to development and cooperation in Africa. \r\nNEPAD, a framework longed for and developed by \r\nAfricans themselves, is an effective guiding \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n13 08-55210 \r\n \r\nmechanism to draw the attention of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment partners to the major issues of concern to \r\nthe continent. In essence, NEPAD embodies Africa’s \r\ndesire to ensure its own prosperity and economic and \r\nsocial development, its determination to mobilize the \r\ncontinent’s resources and potential, and its readiness to \r\npromote substantial partnerships commensurate with \r\nthe challenges.  \r\n NEPAD relies primarily on Africa’s national and \r\nregional potential and responds to needs and desires \r\nidentified by Africans themselves. Given the enormous \r\ntask and scope of the challenges ahead, NEPAD also \r\nconstitutes a call by Africa to its partners to assist the \r\ncontinent in its efforts to endow itself with the means, \r\ninfrastructure and resources — in a word, the necessary \r\nconditions — to join the world economy, which is the \r\nonly way to ensure lasting social and economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n NEPAD was integrated into African Union \r\nstructures at an extraordinary summit held in Algiers in \r\n2007. One of the main decisions of that summit was to \r\nestablish a continent-wide NEPAD authority, referred \r\nto as a development agency. Although the \r\nimplementation committee comprised of NEPAD heads \r\nof State continues to be the highest political decision-\r\nmaking body, the development agency will be \r\nresponsible for developing and implementing specific \r\nNEPAD projects. It will thereby serve as the principal \r\ninterlocutor for foreign partners. \r\n The report (A/63/206) submitted by the \r\nSecretary-General under the relevant agenda item \r\npoints out both the scope of the programmes launched \r\nunder NEPAD and the importance of the progress that \r\nhas been made. It also emphasizes the need for \r\nincreased involvement by the international community \r\nin that new partnership. Whether in the areas of \r\ninfrastructure, health or education, considerable \r\nprogress has been made in recent years thanks to the \r\nimplementation of regional infrastructure projects in \r\nAfrica. Those projects, which are being carried out in \r\nmore and more countries, are helping, among other \r\nthings, to increasingly integrate African economies and \r\nto develop thriving African markets. \r\n Ambitious projects have been launched in the \r\nagricultural sector since 2006, in particular the \r\nmultinational agricultural productivity programme \r\ndesigned to promote the exchange of experiences and \r\nknowledge with partners and the allocation by all \r\nmember States of at least 10 per cent of their national \r\nbudgets to agricultural development. In that way, key \r\nsectors such as the environment, information \r\ntechnology and scientific research have benefited from \r\nsustained attention at the regional level in Africa. As \r\nwe have seen, such projects involve all economic and \r\nsocial sectors, where the needs are great and where \r\ndelays are especially significant. They require \r\nconsiderable financing, that African economies, despite \r\naverage annual growth of 6 per cent, cannot provide. It \r\nis currently estimated that $72 billion will be required \r\nfor several consecutive years in order to truly reverse \r\nthe trend and ensure Africa’s economic development.  \r\n Algeria reiterates its appreciation for the \r\ncontributions of many partners whose commitment and \r\nefforts, along with those of African countries, have \r\nmade a difference on the ground. Such resolute efforts \r\nhave continued for some 10 years in an attempt to \r\nalleviate the debt of the most heavily indebted \r\ncountries, especially in Africa. By the end of 2007, \r\nAfrica’s global debt, which in the late 1990s was about \r\n$274 billion, stood at $243 billion. More important yet, \r\nin the same period, the rate of indebtedness of African \r\ncountries dropped from 212 per cent to 23.1 per cent. \r\nNevertheless, we must do everything possible to \r\nprevent a return to the cycle of indebtedness of the \r\n1980s and 1990s, which devoured the meagre resources \r\nof African countries and completely obliterated the \r\nchances of growing their economies.  \r\n However, the situation is not the same with \r\nregard to official development assistance (ODA). Far \r\nshort of reaching the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross \r\nnational income of donor countries, in real terms there \r\nhas been a consistent drop in ODA year after year. In \r\nsome instances, significant amounts of ODA have been \r\nallocated to debt remittances which, by definition, do \r\nnot directly contribute to financing development. The \r\ndownward trend was further confirmed in 2007, when \r\nODA for Africa decreased by 20 per cent to $35 \r\nbillion, compared to $44 billion in 2006. \r\n Those figures and trends need to be seen against \r\nthe backdrop of the conclusions of the MDG Africa \r\nSteering Group established by the Secretary-General to \r\n“galvanize international support for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment and catalyse the efforts of the Group of \r\nEight and the main multilateral institutions working in \r\nthe domain”. The Secretary-General has, indeed, stated \r\nthat the Group’s work helped to determine that, at this \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 14 \r\n \r\nstage, $72 billion a year would be necessary to achieve \r\nthe MDGs by 2015. \r\n Africa’s share in world trade has fallen \r\ncontinuously in recent years and is now at less than \r\n2 per cent. While that illustrates the weakness of \r\nAfrican economic investment in international markets, \r\nthe low figure is also the result of significant \r\nagricultural subsidies provided by the developed \r\ncountries for their exports. African countries are also \r\nrequesting concrete measures to be implemented to \r\nensure the access of African goods, consisting \r\nprimarily of agricultural products, to the markets of \r\ndeveloped countries under normal conditions.  \r\n The consideration of issues relating to NEPAD \r\nand African development would remain incomplete if it \r\ndid not take into account the need to ensure and \r\npromote viable and durable peace throughout the \r\ncontinent. We cannot insist often enough on the fact \r\nthat no real development can occur without an \r\nenvironment of peace and stability. African countries \r\nand their continental organization, the African Union, \r\nhave made an unprecedented effort to adapt and to \r\nstrengthen African conflict prevention and \r\npeacekeeping capabilities. That commitment and effort, \r\nwhich have benefited from assistance from foreign \r\npartners and the United Nations, has been reflected in \r\nthe structuring and establishment of institutional and \r\noperational means for increasingly effective action; the \r\nestablishment of operational capabilities that can be \r\nmobilized and deployed throughout the continent; and \r\nthe strengthening of the mechanisms and instruments \r\nof cooperation with the United Nations and other \r\npartners in the framework of conflict prevention and \r\npeacekeeping. However, all of those projects continue \r\nto require greater contributions from the partners. \r\n At a time of digital revolution and unprecedented \r\ndevelopment in information technology and the \r\nglobalized economy, the world must work to full \r\ncapacity and use all means at its disposal to take on the \r\nmultiple challenges and crises that threaten it. In that \r\ncontext, instead of being a burden, Africa could and \r\nshould be a major agent for development. It would then \r\ncease to be part of the problem and become an integral \r\npart of the solution. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I am pleased to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for the very enriching introduction with \r\nwhich the President opened this joint debate devoted to \r\nthe economic and social situation in Africa, and \r\nparticularly to international support for the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\n Before discussing certain points of special \r\ninterest to Tunisia, I wish to associate myself fully with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Kenya, on \r\nbehalf of the African Group, and that to be made \r\nshortly by the representative of Antigua and Barbados \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n The growing interest in Africa of the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations system in particular \r\ncan be explained by two facts. On the one hand, the \r\nAfrican continent has been affected by the scourges of \r\npoverty, conflict and pandemics which, to a large \r\nextent, explains why it has clearly fallen behind the \r\nagreed schedule for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). On the other hand, Africa \r\nis a continent on the move that is assuming \r\nresponsibility for its own affairs and moving forward \r\npolitically and economically at the national and \r\nregional levels in order to look after itself and to pull \r\nthrough. The high-level debate held recently on \r\nAfrica’s development needs addressed the state of \r\naffairs in Africa and stressed two main points.  \r\n First, Africa’s needs, constraints, priorities and \r\nobjectives are well known by its partners and by the \r\nactors in the international community. The problem is \r\nat the level of the implementation of the commitments \r\nundertaken. My delegation takes this opportunity to \r\njoin other countries in calling for the establishment of a \r\nfollow-up mechanism  mandated to evaluate the \r\nimplementation of commitments to advance the \r\ndevelopment of Africa, including those listed in the \r\npolitical declaration adopted at the close of the high-\r\nlevel meeting. \r\n Secondly, Africa is the only continent whose \r\nprogress remains below the level required to achieve \r\nthe MDGs and has been far more severely affected than \r\nothers by the food and energy crises. Africa therefore \r\nfaces a double handicap that threatens to compromise \r\nthe progress achieved. \r\n The sixth report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nimplementation of and international support for \r\nNEPAD (A/63/206) offers a mixed assessment, \r\nsimultaneously optimistic and dubious of the impact \r\nand scope of progress achieved. On the one hand, it \r\nshows the existence of new momentum towards \r\nAfrican development, albeit one that is not strong \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n15 08-55210 \r\n \r\nenough to be lasting. On the other hand, it urges the \r\ncontinent’s development partners to honour their \r\ncommitments in this area more purposefully.  \r\n In his report, the Secretary-General advocates the \r\nstrengthening of national and regional capacities to \r\nimplement NEPAD and to ensure consistency and \r\ncoordination between national development plans and \r\nNEPAD priorities, as well as between African countries \r\nand regional development agencies. \r\n Additionally, the Secretary-General calls on \r\nAfrica’s development partners to create an innovative \r\nmechanism to coordinate their activities in the area of \r\naid, trade and debt sustainability. In that context, \r\nhowever, we fear that if the current trend continues, the \r\nGroup of Eight will not be able to fully implement the \r\ncommitment it undertook at the Gleneagles summit in \r\n2005 to double its assistance to Africa by 2010 to \r\napproximately $50 billion annually. The MDG Africa \r\nSteering Group, created by the Secretary-General to \r\nserve as a catalyst for international efforts to help \r\nAfrica, concluded that the full achievement of the \r\nMDGs in Africa by the 2015 deadline will require a \r\nyearly sum of $72 billion. The Doha Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference will be an important stage, \r\neven a turning point, to consolidate gains and to launch \r\na new process to finance development. In that \r\nconnection, my delegation stresses the specific needs \r\nof Africa in financing for development, particularly at \r\nthis time of crisis.  \r\n Despite Africa’s resolve to look after itself by \r\nadopting restructuring plans; despite the progress made \r\nin settling disputes that have jeopardized the \r\ndevelopment of many countries for so long; and despite \r\nthe fact that it constitutes a priority for the \r\ninternational agenda, Africa is still far behind in terms \r\nof the timetable for achieving the MDGs. That is \r\nunlikely to help Africa to accelerate its integration into \r\nthe world economy and thereby ensure lasting \r\ndevelopment and the gradual settlement to conflicts. \r\nPeace will always be precarious and reversible without \r\na favourable economic environment and genuine \r\ndevelopment prospects.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s ambitious goal of \r\nachieving a conflict-free Africa by 2010 continues to \r\ndepend on a certain level of economic growth, human \r\ndevelopment and political stability, which a number of \r\nAfrican countries, especially the poorer ones, will not \r\nbe able to achieve without the help of all their \r\ndevelopment partners. In that context, we salute the \r\nefforts of the African Union, in particular its Peace and \r\nSecurity Council, since the prevention, management \r\nand resolution of conflict and post-conflict situations \r\nare, among others, preconditions for the achievements \r\nof the MDGs and a NEPAD priority. \r\n To that end, the Peace and Security Council \r\nshould be strengthened in material, political, legal, \r\nnormative and institutional terms. Structured, targeted \r\nand coordinated cooperation between the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations could strengthen African \r\ncapacities to prevent conflict and to maintain and \r\nconsolidate peace. Furthermore, we commend the \r\nefforts of the Peacebuilding Commission, which are a \r\ntrue asset from which Africa can benefit, as our \r\ncontinent is the theatre of 75 per cent of all conflict and \r\npost-conflict situations.  \r\n In addition to poverty and conflicts, Africa \r\nsuffers from the ravages of pandemics, in particular \r\nmalaria and HIV/AIDS — scourges whose repercussions \r\nseverely affect human resources and prospects for \r\ndevelopment. While the report of the Secretary-General \r\non malaria certainly describes a situation that gives us \r\nreasons for hope, the road ahead remains long in \r\nmeeting one of the major MDG targets: halting malaria \r\nby 2015. As the efforts and the progress made in that \r\nregard have not been able to bring about a lasting \r\nreversal of the current trend, the scourge continues to \r\nrage, particularly in Africa. Let us pay closer attention \r\nto its ravages, which will require effective joint \r\nmobilization efforts.  \r\n Mr. Sumi (Japan): It is a great pleasure and \r\nhonour to address the Assembly today to discuss the \r\nvery important agenda items relating to African \r\ndevelopment. Before I begin, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General and his \r\nstaff for their diligent work in consolidating the reports \r\nthat we have received. \r\n African development is one of the most urgent \r\npriorities for the world and the United Nations today. \r\nThe 22 September high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs successfully increased the \r\nmomentum needed to follow up on the various \r\ncommitments made to and by Africa and also served as \r\na forum for the international community to hear the \r\nviews of African leaders on that subject. Throughout \r\nthe round tables, many expressed the view that private \r\ninvestment and infrastructure development were of \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 16 \r\n \r\ncritical importance. The same view was expressed at \r\nthe Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment (TICAD IV) in May and at the Group of \r\nEight (G8) Hokkaido Toyako Summit in July. \r\n We have heard the voices of African leaders, and \r\nnow it is time for us to respond. For its part, Japan \r\npledged the following at TICAD IV: first, to double its \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) to Africa; \r\nsecondly, to proactively and flexibly provide up to \r\n$4 billion in soft loans; and thirdly, to work to double \r\nJapanese private investment in Africa over the next \r\nfive years. Our ODA will focus on the priority areas of \r\ninfrastructure development, including in the area of \r\nagriculture; achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs); and combating climate change. Loans \r\nwill focus more specifically on infrastructure \r\ndevelopment through enhanced public-private \r\npartnerships with a view to improving the investment \r\nclimate in Africa. \r\n In implementing those commitments, the \r\nGovernment of Japan aligns its priorities with those set \r\nby the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, \r\nbelieving that the Partnership reflects the genuine \r\nneeds of Africa. In the area of infrastructure, those \r\nneeds are articulated in the Short-term Action Plan; in \r\nthe agricultural field, they are set out in the \r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme. That reflects Japan’s respect for the \r\nprinciples of ownership and partnership, which it \r\nregards as essential to the promotion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\n As Mr. Yoshiro Mori, Special Envoy and former \r\nPrime Minister of Japan, stated at the opening plenary \r\nmeeting held on 22 September, the Government of \r\nJapan is steadily implementing the commitments that it \r\nmade at TICAD IV and has already dispatched joint \r\npublic-private missions for the promotion of trade and \r\ninvestment to 12 African countries. Furthermore, the \r\nJapan-United Nations Development Programme Joint \r\nFramework for Building Partnership to Address \r\nClimate Change in Africa, to which Japan has \r\ncontributed $92.1 million, is in the process of receiving \r\nconcrete proposals for projects to be undertaken. \r\n In order to ensure that the desired accelerated \r\ngrowth will benefit and empower individuals and \r\ncommunities and not aggravate social and economic \r\ndisparities, the principle of human security needs to be \r\ntaken into consideration in the implementation of \r\npolicy measures, especially those relating to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. Japan stands ready to \r\nprovide just such support to the efforts made by the \r\nnations of Africa in areas including education, health \r\nand community development. \r\n We also received another vital message from \r\nAfrica’s leaders — there is an essential linkage \r\nbetween peace and development. Japan, as Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, is committed to providing \r\na range of assistance to post-conflict countries, which, \r\nwe hope, will better enable them to avoid relapsing \r\ninto violence and instead achieve a durable peace. We \r\nhave already taken steps to that end by extending \r\nsupport to training centres for peacekeeping operations \r\nin Africa, and other assistance will follow. \r\n The progress that we make in fulfilling all those \r\ncommitments will be closely monitored via the TICAD \r\nFollow-up Mechanism, which includes annual \r\nministerial follow-up meetings. The importance of \r\nfollow-up was mentioned by almost every African \r\nleader last week, and the Government of Japan stands \r\nready to monitor, follow up on and assess the steps \r\ntaken to honour the commitments made not only by \r\nJapan, but by all relevant stakeholders represented at \r\nTICAD IV. \r\n Regarding agenda item 46, I would like to \r\nexpress my sincere appreciation for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica” (A/63/219) and for the World Malaria Report \r\n2008, recently issued by the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO). My delegation was pleased to learn from those \r\nreports that the number of deaths attributed to malaria \r\nhas declined in several African countries and that a few \r\nof those countries have even managed to cut such \r\ndeaths in half by implementing the measures \r\nrecommended by WHO. In addition, the reports \r\nshowed that increases in funding resulted in \r\naccelerated access to malaria interventions, such as the \r\nprovision of bednets and medicines, in 2006. \r\n Nevertheless, my delegation notes with concern \r\nthat the number of malaria cases worldwide is still \r\nestimated to be as high as 247 million for 2006 and that \r\nchildren under five remain by far the most likely to die \r\nof the disease. We also note that in Africa, only 3 per \r\ncent of children in need have access to artemisinin-\r\nbased combination therapy, which is recommended by \r\nWHO. \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n17 08-55210 \r\n \r\n In July, G8 leaders met on the occasion of the \r\nHokkaido Toyako summit, hosted by the Government \r\nof Japan. It was there that the G8 leaders agreed on the \r\nimportance of ensuring that a comprehensive approach \r\nembodying disease-specific measures and the \r\nstrengthening of health systems contributes to \r\nachieving all the health-related MDGs by focusing in \r\nparticular on the capacity-building of health workers. \r\nThe Toyako Framework for Action, which was set forth \r\nby the G8 health experts, includes principles for action; \r\nsets out actions to be taken in the area of health, \r\ndrawing on the expertise of international institutions; \r\nand provides for the establishment of a follow-up \r\nmechanism for monitoring progress in meeting the \r\ncommitments made.  \r\n My delegation recognizes the positive impact that \r\nthe efforts of a number of stakeholders have had. I \r\nrefer in particular to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, to which Japan pledged an \r\nadditional $560 million earlier this year. My delegation \r\nalso welcomed the Global Malaria Action Plan and \r\nother outcomes announced at the 2008 Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Malaria Summit that took place on \r\n25 September on the initiative of Mr. Ray Chambers, \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Malaria. \r\n G8 leaders also agreed to focus on promoting the \r\nexpansion of access to long-lasting insecticide-treated \r\nnets, with a view to providing 100 million nets through \r\nbilateral and multilateral assistance, in partnership with \r\nother stakeholders by the end of 2010. I would note in \r\nthis regard that a number of African countries have \r\nexpressed great appreciation for one such net, the \r\nOlyset net, made by Sumitomo Chemical. This net is \r\nmade in Africa, and Japan hopes that both the net itself \r\nand its production will contribute to sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\n In closing, my delegation would like to reaffirm \r\nJapan’s readiness to contribute constructively and \r\nconcretely to the development of an Africa, that will \r\nrealize its vast potential, a truly vibrant Africa a \r\ncontinent of hope and opportunity. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports on progress achieved \r\nin the implementation of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) (A/63/206) and on the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in \r\nhis report on the causes of conflict and the promotion \r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n(A/63/212) and for transmitting the report on the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa (see A/63/219). \r\n I would also like to align myself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Kenya on \r\nbehalf of the African Group and the statement to be \r\nmade by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n We meet today in exceptional economic \r\ncircumstances, with a growing number of crises, \r\nrelated to food, energy, international financial markets, \r\nand climate change. There is no doubt that it is the \r\nAfrican continent that will be the most adversely \r\naffected by this series of developments. This is \r\nparticularly true as most of its countries are far from \r\nachieving the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n What makes the situation worse is that our \r\nAfrican continent is home to the largest number of \r\nleast developed countries whose development efforts \r\nwill be hampered by these crises, at a time when we \r\nhave convened two high-level meetings, one on \r\nAfrica’s development needs and one on the \r\nimplementation of MDGs, with the goal of increasing \r\nfinancial assistance directed to Africa. \r\n The international community, particularly the \r\ndeveloped countries, and the international financial \r\ninstitutions, must therefore act at a speed that \r\ncorresponds to the pace of these exceptional \r\ndevelopments and their negative repercussions on \r\nAfrican States. Undoubtedly, the implementation of the \r\npolitical declaration on Africa’s development needs \r\n(resolution 63/1), along with the proposals put forward \r\nby our leaders at the high-level meeting on the MDGs, \r\nconstitute a strong basis to build on in this context. \r\nThis is further strengthened by the decisions taken at \r\nthe eleventh African Union Summit, held in Sharm \r\nel-Sheikh, which form a road map for the \r\ncomprehensive development of Africa and for \r\nsupporting the implementation of NEPAD. \r\n There is no doubt that the starting point lies in the  \r\nscrupulous implementation of agreements reached \r\naimed at establishing, by the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, a follow-up mechanism to review \r\nthe implementation of development commitments to \r\nAfrica. Egypt has long called for such a mechanism as \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 18 \r\n \r\na vital basis for evaluating the fulfilment of each side’s \r\ncommitments. \r\n From this perspective, I would like to recall that \r\nAfrican countries have taken major strides towards \r\nimplementing their NEPAD commitments in various \r\nfields, such as infrastructure, health, agriculture, \r\neducation, information and communications \r\ntechnology, science and technology, implementing \r\nsound economic policies, and, in particular, the \r\nestablishment and operation of the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism, which now comprises 29 African \r\nStates. This demonstrates that the continent has \r\nachieved real progress in the areas of good governance, \r\nrespect for human rights and promoting democracy in a \r\ncooperative context. That stresses the African \r\ncommitment towards development, peace and human \r\nrights as a basis for progress. \r\n On the other hand, we see industrialized countries \r\nof the Group of Eight lagging behind in achieving the \r\ngoal of doubling their assistance to Africa by 2010. \r\nThe continent’s overall share of foreign direct \r\ninvestments remain low, and continues to be confined \r\nto a limited number of States and sectors. \r\n In addition, the failure to reach an agreement in \r\nthe Doha Development Round is unfortunate at a time \r\nwhen Africa’s share of international trade is a mere \r\n2 per cent. While we welcome the progress achieved by \r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative \r\nand the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, we note that \r\nprogress remains slow. This highlights the need for \r\nnew and innovative sources to finance the development \r\nof African States, particularly in the light of the \r\nexceptional economic circumstances that we face \r\ntoday. There is no doubt that the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, to be held in Doha at the end of \r\nNovember, will provide a window of opportunity to \r\nemphasize all mutual agreements in this regard. \r\n This brings me to the important role played by \r\nthe United Nations in support of Africa’s development \r\nefforts. We call for strengthening that role in parallel \r\nwith the positive role already being played by the \r\nAfrican Union, regional organizations and institutions \r\nsuch as the African Development Bank, the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa, as well as with the crucial \r\nefforts made at the subregional level, through African \r\neconomic groupings. We look forward to reflecting all \r\nof these efforts in the outcomes of this year’s \r\ndevelopment-related meetings, with a view to \r\naddressing more effectively the development needs of \r\nthe continent. \r\n Egypt supports the steps taken by the United \r\nNations, over the past year, in cooperation with the \r\nAfrican Union to address conflicts in Africa, through \r\npreventive diplomacy, mediation and good offices. \r\nSuch commendable efforts have led to the peaceful \r\nsettlement of internal disputes that erupted in Kenya \r\nand in Zimbabwe, and to stabilizing the various other \r\nconflict situations in Africa. \r\n Along the same lines, Egypt supports United \r\nNations and African Union peacekeeping efforts in \r\nseveral African countries, including through our large \r\nmilitary contribution to the African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). \r\nMoreover, Egypt backs the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s efforts in Burundi, Sierra Leone, \r\nGuinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic and \r\nthose of the Peacebuilding Fund to finance \r\npeacebuilding projects through its three-window \r\narchitecture. We affirm the need to enhance \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union on peacebuilding issues along the lines \r\nof existing cooperation in the fields of peacekeeping \r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n I commend the existing cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council and the African Union \r\nPeace and Security Council and applaud the two \r\nCouncils for holding a joint meeting in April 2008, at \r\nwhich they exchanged views on the situations in the \r\nSudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n Since the Millennium Summit launched the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nparticularly in Africa, there has been success in \r\nbringing the number of malaria-free countries to 93. A \r\ntangible reduction in infection rates was also achieved \r\nin a number of other countries. This was the result of \r\nprogrammes being implemented in cooperation with \r\nthe United Nations and its relevant bodies, \r\ninternational financial institutions, non-governmental \r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector as \r\nwell as to the increase in available funding for such \r\nprogrammes. However, the continuing spread of the \r\ndisease in 109 countries reaffirms the need for \r\ncontinued support and sustainability of funding in \r\norder to cut the mortality rate by half by 2010, with a \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n19 08-55210 \r\n \r\nview to cutting mortality by 75 per cent by 2015. \r\nAlmost half of the world’s population is still threatened \r\nby malaria, which kills more than 800,000 people a \r\nyear, most of whom reside in low-income countries and \r\n91 per cent of whom live in Africa, which retains the \r\nhighest risk level worldwide. \r\n These facts underline the dire need to support \r\nefforts to revamp the economic, educational and health \r\ninfrastructure in developing countries. There is also a \r\nserious need to transfer the technical knowledge \r\nnecessary to support these efforts and ensure early \r\ndiagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease through \r\nthe participation of all stakeholders. This approach \r\nentails intensifying national awareness campaigns and \r\nimplementing prevention and treatment programmes. \r\nMost countries, especially those in Africa, cannot \r\nsucceed in these tasks alone. We should take into \r\nconsideration techniques such as spraying and \r\nimmunization.  \r\n Parallel to national capacity-building, it is \r\nimperative to concentrate on enhancing regional \r\ncapacities to confront the cross-border aspects of \r\nmalaria. That was one of the motivations behind the \r\ndecision taken at the African Union summit held in \r\nSirte in 2005, based on an Egyptian initiative that \r\ncalled for establishing an African Centre to encourage \r\ncooperation and exchange of knowledge in combating \r\nthe disease. The centre would be linked with \r\nspecialized centres in this field at the continent level. \r\n It is also imperative in this regard to resolve the \r\ntrade-related aspects of intellectual property rights \r\nattaching to malaria medications and vaccines \r\ncurrently in circulation or being developed. The \r\ninternational community must shoulder its \r\nresponsibility so as to ensure the effectiveness of \r\nefforts to eliminate malaria and the risk of its \r\nresurgence. In that way, we would realize our common \r\ngoals, particularly MDG6, by the targeted date, and in \r\nall States without exception. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): Canada is pleased once \r\nagain to join this important debate on Africa. The past \r\nyear has seen great changes in the global economic \r\nsituation. We have seen commodity prices rise to \r\nhistoric highs, then fall. We have seen instability in the \r\nfinancial and stock markets, as well as double- and \r\ntriple-digit inflation in food prices. These challenges \r\nare in addition to others such as climate change and the \r\nenduring peace and security problems of the continent. \r\n At the midpoint to 2015, it is clear that, while \r\nthere has been some progress, much remains to be done \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Achieving the MDGs is a shared \r\nresponsibility requiring an agreed approach, \r\ncontinuous efforts and sustained partnerships.  \r\n Canada is doing its part to help Africa’s efforts to \r\nachieve the MDGs, and Canada is meeting its \r\ncommitments. We are doubling our international \r\nassistance to reach $5 billion by 2010 and, in \r\nparticular, we are meeting our commitment to double \r\naid to Africa, increasing it to $2.1 billion this year. \r\nCanada is also untying all its food aid and will untie all \r\nits development assistance by 2012, consistent with the \r\nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra \r\nAgenda for Action. Untying aid will make Canada’s aid \r\nmore effective and help Canada do its part in this \r\nglobal development challenge. \r\n Canada has made important contributions to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs, particularly in the areas of \r\nfood security, child health and education. For example, \r\nCanada has committed itself to increasing its annual \r\nbilateral support for basic education in Africa from \r\n$100 million to $150 million by 2010. Over the past \r\nfive years, Canada’s support to education in Africa \r\nhelped over 6 million children, half of them girls, to \r\nattend school in our partner countries.  \r\n Development must also proceed in the private \r\nsphere. Canada is one of the world leaders in \r\ndemonstrating how natural resources, managed in a \r\nsustainable way, can provide broad economic and \r\nsocial benefits without adversely affecting the \r\nenvironment. Canadian companies working in Africa \r\nare committed to being good corporate citizens, and the \r\nCanadian Government expects them to be good \r\ncorporate citizens. \r\n Canada initiated the African Mining Partnership \r\nwith African nations to deal with the crucial issues of \r\ngovernance, sustainable development of communities, \r\nhuman resource skills and institutional capacity, and to \r\nprovide basic requirements such as water and \r\nsanitation, primary health care and education. \r\n Development success and partnerships are \r\nunderpinned by effective democratic governance \r\nnetworks. Canada’s assistance includes strengthening \r\ndemocratic institutions and practices, such as electoral \r\nand legislative systems. It is focused on the \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 20 \r\n \r\nengagement of both civil society and individual \r\ncitizens, particularly women, in the political process. \r\n Through the establishment of a Democratic \r\nTransitions Fund, Canada is working to respond better \r\nto crises affecting young democracies and to strengthen \r\ninternational stability through support of democratic \r\ngovernance. The main objective of Canada’s \r\ndemocracy support efforts abroad is to strengthen core \r\ndemocratic elements that give citizens a greater say \r\nover the institutions and decisions that affect their \r\nlives. These core elements are electoral systems, \r\nparliaments, civil society, independent media and \r\npolitical parties. \r\n Canada’s support for the running of free and fair \r\nelections over the past decade has included initiatives \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Mali, \r\nMozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia. We are \r\nencouraged by the increase in free and fair elections in \r\nAfrica but note at the same time that there have been, \r\nin the past year, a few examples of defective electoral \r\nprocesses that have thrown societies into turmoil. As a \r\nresult, precious time, attention and resources have been \r\nconsumed and lives have been lost and shattered due to \r\nthese events. \r\n In the light of what occurred in the past year, and \r\nlooking forward to electoral processes in other African \r\nnations, Canada urges the Governments of Africa to \r\nfulfil the promise made to their citizens at the African \r\nUnion summit in January of last year when they \r\nadopted the African Charter on Democracy, Elections \r\nand Governance. \r\n Canada is proud to be continuing its work with \r\nAfrican partners in support of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism (APRM). Canada is encouraged \r\nthat these will be integrated into the workings of the \r\nAfrican Union. Canada was the first contributor to the \r\nAPRM Trust Fund. We recently committed another \r\n$5 million to help enable progress in encouraging \r\nadherence to democratic governance principles through \r\nself-monitoring and peer monitoring. The past year has \r\nseen another two countries sign onto the APRM. We \r\nlook forward to the integration of this mechanism into \r\nthe African Union, leading to even more commitments. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Canada acknowledges the significant progress \r\nmade in improving the peace and security situation in \r\nAfrica, while we note that many challenges remain. \r\nCanada commends the African Union for progress on \r\nthe development of the African Peace and Security \r\nArchitecture and is prepared to work with partners \r\ntowards the realization of the African Standby Force \r\ntraining and implementation plan in line with the \r\nprinciples of African leadership and ownership. In \r\nsupport of this effort, Canada announced a contribution \r\nof $10.3 million for capacity-building work for police \r\npeacekeeping in Africa and for the development of \r\nAfrican peacekeeping centres of excellence. \r\n My country is currently part of the international \r\neffort to end the suffering of the populations of Darfur \r\nin the Sudan. Moreover, both diplomatically and \r\nfinancially, we are at the frontlines of efforts to \r\npromote sustainable peace. The seriousness of the \r\ndeteriorating humanitarian situation in that region, \r\ncoupled with the ongoing impasse in the peace process, \r\nis a source of deep concern. In that regard, Canada \r\ncalls on all parties to the conflict to halt hostilities and \r\nhuman rights violations — which to date have been \r\ncarried out with impunity — protect civilians, facilitate \r\nhumanitarian operations and the deployment of the \r\nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur and support the work of the United Nations-\r\nAfrican Union Joint Chief Mediator. \r\n Since 2006, my country has made a very \r\nsubstantial contribution — totalling $477 million — to \r\npeace and to meeting basic human needs throughout \r\nthe Sudan. Canada is actively participating in efforts \r\naimed at the full implementation of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement. In line with the Agreement, elections \r\nare to be held in 2009. I wish to underscore the need \r\nfor those elections to be free and fair. \r\n The recent renewal of confrontation and activity \r\nby opposing forces in the eastern Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo has almost completely dashed the hopes \r\nfor peace and stability engendered by the Nairobi \r\ncommuniqué, the Goma agreements and the entry into \r\nforce of the Pact on Security, Stability and \r\nDevelopment in the Great Lakes Region. We urge all \r\nparties to respect State authority and the commitments \r\nmade. \r\n In conclusion, along with our African partners, I \r\nwould like to express our satisfaction over the \r\nachievements of the past year. Nevertheless, we must \r\nnot forget the challenges that emerged during the same \r\nyear, namely, the rise in the price of foodstuffs, market \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n21 08-55210 \r\n \r\ninstability and electoral problems, all of which add to \r\nthe ongoing difficulties faced by peace and security on \r\nthe continent. It is worth noting once again that the \r\nachievement of the MDGs is a joint responsibility. \r\nCanada will contribute to solving the problems facing \r\nAfricans, in particular by honouring the crucial \r\ncommitment of doubling assistance to the continent. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): At the outset, allow \r\nme to associate myself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Thailand on behalf of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations and with the one to be \r\nmade by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on \r\nbehalf of the G77 and China. \r\n Indonesia would like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/63/206) submitted under the \r\nagenda item on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). It is very encouraging to learn \r\nfrom the report that noteworthy progress has been \r\nmade by many African countries in the area of \r\ndevelopment. That progress is especially commendable \r\ngiven the persistent challenges facing the continent. \r\n There is no denying that a gentle breeze of \r\nchange is blowing across Africa. Peace and \r\npeacebuilding are emerging in areas where there was \r\nonce only conflict. The wheel of development is \r\nbeginning to rotate in an unrelenting manner on the \r\ncontinent. The results of recent initiatives augur well \r\nfor Africa’s future. Development and peace are now \r\nmerging to create conditions for sustained progress. \r\nThat is due in no small part to the role being played by \r\nthe United Nations. The work of the United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in supporting peace as a \r\nprerequisite for sustainable development is \r\ncommendable.  \r\n Indonesia believes that the private sector should \r\nalso play a role in providing both financial and \r\nnon-financial support for the efforts of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. To that end, earlier this \r\nyear, Indonesia facilitated the establishment of a task \r\nforce by the Commission’s Organizational Committee. \r\nThe task force focused on tangible ways by which the \r\nCommission will be able to strengthen the private \r\nsector’s engagement in post-conflict peacebuilding. \r\n With peace, African countries will be able to \r\npursue their development. Through the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, Africa’s leaders \r\nand peoples are seeking integration into the global \r\neconomy. That vision for the continent is an important \r\nprogressive step. Indonesia therefore welcomes \r\nNEPAD’s role as a catalyst for change. It is the means \r\nwhereby Africa will experience peace and security, \r\ndemocracy, good governance and capacity-building and \r\nimprove its macroeconomic development frameworks. \r\n On the whole, international development support \r\nfor Africa is intensifying, but the pace for such support \r\nmust be accelerated. There are signs that that is already \r\nbeginning to take place. International initiatives, such \r\nas debt relief and cancellation and aid-for-trade, are \r\nbeing implemented. However, the magnitude of \r\nAfrica’s development challenges demands ever-\r\nincreasing support and commitment. The public health \r\nthreat from HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other \r\ncommunicable diseases has not diminished. Africa’s \r\nhigh child mortality rate needs to be reduced. Poverty, \r\nthe lack of investment and infrastructure development \r\nand low productivity all obstruct development. They \r\nundermine the continent’s capacity to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n With the current global financial, food and energy \r\ncrises, as well as climate change, Africa finds itself at a \r\ngreat disadvantage in pursuing the MDGs. To change \r\nits fate, the international community needs to support \r\nAfrica in the same way it did Europe after the two \r\nworld wars.  \r\n Global partnership and international support are \r\nimperative. They must allow Africa to maximize its \r\npotential and use its domestic resources for growth and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Bilateral and triangular cooperation, as well as \r\nSouth-South cooperation, are important in that regard. \r\nThrough public-private and private-private partnerships, \r\nAfrica’s creative capacities must be expanded. \r\nInternational support must also include financing for \r\nthe successful implementation of various domestic \r\ninitiatives. \r\n Other mechanisms can contribute to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment as well. Accordingly, Asia and Africa, \r\nwith Indonesia and South Africa as co-chairs, have \r\nbeen deepening their special historical relationship. \r\nThe solidarity of the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference held \r\nin Bandung, Indonesia, has been renewed under the \r\nNew Asian-African Strategic Partnership (NAASP) of \r\n2005. That is the foundation of our regions’ closeness. \r\nThrough the Partnership, Indonesia has built a solid \r\nbase for extensive cooperation. In the field of \r\nagriculture and food security, Indonesia has assisted \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 22 \r\n \r\nwith capacity-building. Appropriate technology has \r\nbeen transferred and we are currently working with a \r\nnumber of countries in Africa to develop rice fields, \r\nwith seed varieties that suit the continent’s weather and \r\nfarming conditions. \r\n Along with the Strategic Partnership, use is being \r\nmade of the Non-Aligned Movement’s Centre for \r\nSouth-South Technical Cooperation in Jakarta to assist \r\nand support Africa in catching up in the development \r\nrace. Indonesia is also providing support and technical \r\ncooperation in areas such as education, poverty \r\nalleviation, science and technology and \r\nmicrofinancing. \r\n Our ultimate goal is to put Africa on track for \r\nachieving the MDGs. Ensuring that Africa succeeds in \r\nits development must continue to be a matter of global \r\nconcern. That success will contribute to global \r\neconomic growth, peace and security. Consequently, \r\nthere must be no slackening of support for Africa’s \r\nprogress. Should that happen, the current development \r\nmomentum will quickly lose power. But not only must \r\ninternational support be consistent, it must also be \r\nadequate and sustainable. At all times, the development \r\nparadigm on the continent must be specific to African \r\nparticularities and benefit from African leadership. \r\n Mr. Kumalo (South Africa): My delegation \r\nwishes to associate itself with the statements made by \r\nthe representative of Kenya on behalf of the African \r\nGroup and by the representative of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Also, my delegation wishes to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his three reports on the items we \r\nare discussing today, namely, the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) (A/63/206), causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/63/212) and the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa (A/63/219). \r\n We come here today overshadowed by major \r\ncrises that have a direct impact on the African \r\ncontinent — high food prices, the scarcity of food and \r\nhigh fuel prices, as well as the uncertainty in the global \r\nfinancial system. All of these are intertwined and pose \r\na threat not only to the achievement of NEPAD, but to \r\nall the progress we have seen in the past few years. \r\n High food prices cut directly into the incomes of \r\nthe poorest and reduce the resources available to feed \r\nour people. Increased prices also strain the \r\ncommitments African Governments have made to the \r\nsocial security, education and health care of our people. \r\n Moreover, the uncertainty in the international \r\nfinancial system will, in turn, threaten or even \r\nundermine the coherence and consistency of the \r\nfinancial and trading systems and their support of \r\ndevelopment. This has made the mobilization of \r\nresources more difficult, thereby raising the spectre of \r\nunsustainable debt once again, haunting heavily \r\nindebted poor countries in Africa. \r\n The global community needs to take urgent action \r\nin support of NEPAD to ensure that the economic \r\ndevelopment gap between Africa and developed \r\ncountries does not increase further. This is important in \r\norder to make certain that the impact of developed \r\ncountries’ monetary policies, trade policies and, in \r\nparticular, trade distorting subsidies do not place extra \r\nfinancial and economic burdens on Africa. \r\n We must thus take a holistic approach to the \r\ninterconnected national, international and systemic \r\nchallenges of financing for development, one which is \r\ngender-sensitive and people-centred, particularly in the \r\ncontext of Africa’s development. \r\n Collective and coherent action is needed in each \r\ninterrelated area, involving all stakeholders in an active \r\npartnership to ensure the success of NEPAD. More \r\nthan ever before, Africa needs the global community to \r\ndisplay the unequivocal political will to urgently \r\noperationalize and implement all commitments made to \r\nAfrica. \r\n It is clear that, despite all the actions and \r\ncommitments by the African countries and institutions, \r\nthe main constraint remains the lack of resources, be it \r\nfinancial or otherwise. It is therefore evident that for \r\nNEPAD to succeed, it needs to become a true \r\npartnership between Africa and the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n In order for us to succeed, the United Nations \r\nmust, in accordance with the political declaration on \r\nAfrica’s development needs, adopted at the beginning \r\nof the sixty-third session, consider a monitoring \r\nmechanism to review the full and timely \r\nimplementation of all commitments related to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment no later than in the sixty-fifth session. \r\n My delegation concurs with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the causes of conflict and the \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n23 08-55210 \r\n \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa. The African Union has made \r\nsubstantial progress in conflict prevention on the \r\ncontinent. It is now up to the international community \r\nto press forward with increased dedication, together \r\nwith African regional organizations, to assure lasting \r\npeace and development in the face of growing global \r\nchallenges and crisis. \r\n From an African perspective, the overarching \r\nobjective of Africa’s NEPAD process of renewal is the \r\nAfrican renaissance, a move to break the vicious cycle \r\nof political instability, conflict, poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment and to underpin the continent’s \r\ncapacity to defend and advance its own interests in the \r\nglobal arena. The key building blocks of this \r\nrenaissance strategy include greater unity and \r\nsolidarity, acceleration of political and socio-economic \r\nintegration and increased international support. \r\n The African Union has taken full ownership and \r\nresponsibility for peace and security on the African \r\ncontinent. We have developed a continental security \r\narchitecture, established an African Standby Force and \r\narticulated a wide range of underpinning norms and \r\nvalues, all aimed at conflict prevention, resolution and \r\npost-conflict reconstruction. \r\n However, if Africa is to succeed in the peace and \r\nsecurity sector, a global partnership will also be \r\nnecessary. The role of the international community \r\nmust be aimed at supporting African-owned priorities \r\nfor conflict prevention, conflict management and post-\r\nconflict situations. \r\n Without peace and security, the so-called threats \r\nto Africa, such as poverty, disease and illiteracy, will \r\nremain unchecked. This points to the need for a \r\nstronger development focus in the international \r\ncommunity’s approach. The building structures for \r\npeace and security have to incorporate their \r\nsocio-economic and political aspects. After all, both \r\nthe causes and consequences of conflict and instability \r\nin Africa are clearly linked to global developments and \r\nrelations in the international arena. \r\n Finally, my delegation wishes to touch briefly on \r\nagenda item 43, including the report of the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO) on rolling back malaria in \r\ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa (see \r\nA/63/219). South Africa is one of the signatories of the \r\nAbuja Declaration, in which we committed ourselves \r\nto reducing malaria morbidity and mortality by 50 per \r\ncent by the year 2010. Although some may argue that \r\nwe have already achieved this target, rolling back \r\nmalaria encompasses more than the decrease in \r\nmorbidity and mortality. As this year’s theme to \r\ncommemorate World Malaria Day, 25 April 2008, \r\nsuggested, malaria is a disease without borders and it \r\ntherefore becomes crucial to form partnerships in \r\ncombating it. \r\n It is the conviction of my delegation that the fight \r\nagainst malaria can be won, by destroying the \r\nmosquitoes that cause the disease. As the WHO report \r\nnotes, the aims of the global fight against malaria are \r\nnot only to reduce the burden of the disease in endemic \r\nareas, but also to reduce and confine the geographical \r\nextent of malaria-endemic areas in the world. This \r\nentails the elimination of malaria from countries and \r\nlocalities where this is feasible. We are committed to \r\ndoing that. \r\n Mr. Swe (Myanmar): First of all, I wish to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report \r\n(A/63/206) under sub-item (a) of agenda item 57, on \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD). My delegation is convinced that the \r\nsuccessful implementation of NEPAD is central to the \r\nachievement of sustainable development for Africa. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nby the representative of Thailand on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. \r\n Six years ago, the General Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 57/2, entitled “United Nations Declaration \r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development”, \r\ndemonstrating the international community’s support \r\nfor Africa’s home-grown initiative. The special \r\ndevelopment needs of Africa were recognized at many \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits and at \r\nthe recent high-level meeting held to address that issue. \r\n The international community must give due \r\nrecognition to the efforts made by African countries. \r\nThey have taken firm ownership and leadership of \r\nNEPAD. They have firmly set priorities; they have \r\ntaken initiatives, individually and collectively; and \r\nthey have carried out administrative, civil service, \r\neconomic and judiciary reforms to bring about change \r\non the continent and to strive for sustainable growth \r\nand development. \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 24 \r\n \r\n During the past four years, Africa has achieved \r\nrecord economic growth. In 2007, the continent \r\nregistered a gross domestic product growth rate of \r\n5.8 per cent. However, the decline in official development \r\nassistance (ODA), the rise in food and fuel prices, the \r\nrecent financial crisis and the impact of climate change \r\nthreaten to reverse the progress achieved. \r\n Africa is a continent full of dynamism and \r\npotential. However, in the face of new and growing \r\nchallenges, the continued strong support of the United \r\nNations system and the international community will \r\nbe necessary to make poverty eradication and \r\ndevelopment in Africa a reality. The international \r\ncommunity must help Africa to help itself. In that \r\nregard, I should like to explore a few areas in which \r\ninternational support would significantly help Africa’s \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Trade plays an important role in promoting \r\neconomic growth. Despite the fact that Africa, with \r\nmore than 920 million inhabitants, represents 12 per \r\ncent of the world’s population, its share of international \r\ntrade is only 2 per cent. The promotion of an equitable \r\nand fair multilateral trading system would go a long \r\nway in promoting Africa’s trade prospects. Agricultural \r\nsubsidies, tariff and non-tariff barriers and other trade-\r\ndistorting measures must be eliminated to expand \r\nmarket access to African products. A successful \r\nconclusion of the Doha Round with the development \r\ndimension at its core is also necessary to improve \r\nAfrica’s trade prospects. \r\n The decline in ODA in recent years constitutes a \r\ndevelopment impediment for many developing \r\ncountries, particularly those in Africa, which must rely \r\non ODA for many of their development projects. We \r\ncall on Africa’s development partners to fully \r\nimplement commitments made at international \r\nconferences and the pledge made at Gleneagles. The \r\nSecretary-General’s proposal that external financing \r\nfor Africa be increased to $72 billion annually deserves \r\nour fullest support. \r\n Debt sustainability is essential for growth and \r\ncrucial to the success of Africa’s efforts to eradicate \r\npoverty and achieve development. Currently, sub-\r\nSaharan Africa is the only region to see a real reduction \r\nin debt under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt \r\nInitiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. \r\nDebt relief should therefore be provided to all African \r\ncountries that carry heavy debt burdens. Moreover, \r\ndebt relief should be fully financed through additional \r\nresources. \r\n It is vitally important that the international \r\ncommunity provide Africa with financial and technical \r\nsupport in strategic areas such as agriculture, trade, \r\ninfrastructure development, health and education. \r\nAfrica will need to address the challenges posed by \r\nHIV/AIDS. An intellectual property rights regime that \r\nis flexible enough to provide the general public with \r\nmuch-needed affordable medications would greatly \r\nbenefit Africa’s fight against HIV/AIDS. \r\n Climate change can have a negative impact on the \r\nefforts of developing countries to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. African countries will \r\nneed climate change financing to assist their adaptation \r\nand mitigation efforts. Here again, it must be stressed \r\nthat financing for responses to climate change should \r\nbe additional support in terms of resources and should \r\nnot detract from the implementation of other \r\ndevelopment priorities. \r\n The recent high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs and high-level event on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals enabled the \r\ninternational community to renew its commitment to \r\nAfrica’s development. The primary responsibility for \r\nAfrica’s development rests with African countries. To \r\nthat end, African leaders have taken bold initiatives to \r\ntake charge of their own destiny. However, without \r\nstrong support from the international community, \r\nAfrica’s path to development would be a long and \r\nwinding one. Africa needs our fullest support. The \r\ninternational community must not fail Africa. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nBelarus welcomes the significant increase in the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s focus on development in Africa. \r\nLess than a month after the high-level event on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs, we are once again discussing how \r\nwe can undertake joint efforts to enable the citizens of \r\nthe African continent to believe in a better tomorrow.  \r\n Belarus is convinced that the future of humankind \r\nwill depend upon our determination and our capacity to \r\nresolve the problems of the global systemic order that \r\nare now facing Africa. If we succeed, we will create \r\ngreat momentum for the development of the entire \r\ninternational community; if we fail, the maturity of \r\nhuman civilization will be called into question.  \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n25 08-55210 \r\n \r\n While Belarus is quite distant from Africa, we \r\nhave long felt our spiritual closeness to the fate of the \r\ncontinent and promoted its development. Nearly \r\n50 years ago, Belarus was among the sponsors of the \r\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to \r\nColonial Countries and Peoples, which proclaimed the \r\nneed to put an end to colonialism. Later, we selflessly \r\nopened the doors of our universities to students from \r\nAfrica and began to participate in the social and \r\neconomic development of a number of African States.  \r\n Belarus, while not yet a donor, is prepared to do \r\nmuch for African countries. We are currently proposing \r\nto make educational and technological investments in \r\nAfrica and to share our experience in the area of food \r\nsecurity. At the Third International Ministerial \r\nConference on the State of Middle Income Countries, \r\nheld in Namibia in August, I served as a Vice-Chair \r\nand as keynote speaker for its energy segment.  \r\n In a number of African countries, Belarus has \r\nlaunched joint ventures to produce modern automobiles \r\nand tractors based on Belarusian technology and is \r\nconsidering increasing its participation in related \r\ninfrastructure projects. At the same time, we are \r\nconcerned that, at the present rate, we will not be able \r\nto double development assistance to Africa by 2010, a \r\npledge made at the Group of Eight summit held at \r\nGleneagles. We join in the many appeals to developed \r\ncountries to take concrete measures to honour that \r\nimportant commitment. \r\n Moreover, in our joint work to resolve the global \r\ncrises, we are paying priority attention to the needs of \r\nthe African continent. Africa is encountering \r\nconsiderable difficulty in its efforts to counter the \r\nnegative effects of climate change, regardless of the \r\nfact that it has the lowest levels of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. Africa’s vulnerability clearly lies in its food \r\nsecurity. The continent represents barely two per cent \r\nof overall international trade, but it is encountering \r\nserious economic problems as a result of the current \r\nfinancial crisis. \r\n In that regard, we call on the relevant United \r\nNations bodies to study in-depth the discrepancy \r\nbetween the cost of goods from Africa when they are \r\nbrought by major transnational companies and when \r\nthey are sold on world markets. We feel that \r\ncorrections in that process could be one of the most \r\nimportant steps towards the establishment of a just \r\nworld economic order.  \r\n We must also better trust the African countries to \r\nchoose the ways and means of settling their continent’s \r\nproblems. The African Union’s mandate to maintain \r\nregional peace and stability must be strengthened. The \r\nSecurity Council needs to find practical ways to \r\nexpand the role of the African Union, especially by \r\nsupporting its Peace and Security Council.  \r\n We recognize the vital need to invest broadly in \r\nenergy infrastructure, as stressed in the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). In that \r\nrespect, it is also important actively to promote the use \r\nof renewable sources of energy, clean energy and \r\neffective energy-saving processes. We hope that \r\nAfrican countries will play an active role at this session \r\nof the General Assembly in thematic discussion on the \r\nneed for all States to seek energy-saving technologies \r\nand the use of alternative and renewable energy \r\nresources. \r\n The role of African countries in resolving urgent \r\nproblems within their own system is critical. In that \r\nconnection, we note that we are encouraged that the \r\nAfrican Union has decided to make contributions to \r\nhelp advance work on a comprehensive plan of action \r\nto fight traffic in persons. We welcome the decision \r\ntaken at the African Union summit to launch \r\nnegotiations on the comprehensive plan. Belarus has \r\nadvocated the idea of such a plan for several years, and \r\nwe are ready to work practically together with the \r\nAfrican countries to make it a reality. \r\n We also wish to invite our African partners to \r\nconsider the feasibility of working with the United \r\nNations system, above all on the basis of the \r\nattainments of NEPAD, on a long-term coordinated \r\nAfrica-United Nations strategy for action along the \r\nlines of the joint Africa-European Union strategy. Such \r\na strategy would enable the development on a global \r\nlevel of a vector for African development that would \r\nhave a positive impact on the coordination of work to \r\nassist the peoples of the continent.  \r\n Mr. Taha (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statements to be \r\nmade by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the \r\nrepresentative of Kenya on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. \r\n Africa has made considerable progress since the \r\nbeginning of the implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 26 \r\n \r\nPartnership demonstrates the will and the commitment \r\nof the African countries to put the continent on the road \r\nto economic and social development by controlling its \r\nown development actions. Today, halfway through the \r\ntimeline towards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015, Africa is the \r\nonly continent suffering from major obstacles to its \r\nefforts to combat poverty and want. Therefore, the \r\ninternational community must mobilize its efforts to \r\nhelp Africa to implement effectively all parts of \r\nNEPAD and all its commitments under NEPAD \r\nwithout delay. \r\n The high-level meeting of the General Assembly \r\non 22 September was held to address the particular \r\nneeds of African development and to assess the \r\nimplementation of commitments and the challenges of \r\nthe future. It represented an important step towards \r\nstrengthening NEPAD. The political declaration \r\nconcerning the specific needs of Africa stresses the \r\ncommitment of heads of State and Governments, \r\nMinisters and the various delegations at the United \r\nNations to the particular needs of Africa, as reflected in \r\nthe Millennium Declaration, the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on NEPAD and the Monterrey Consensus \r\nadopted at the International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, and the Outcome Document of the \r\n2005 World Summit. All of those instruments were \r\ndesigned to strengthen the international partnership \r\nbetween countries on the basis of common values and \r\nthe mobilization of human, technological and financial \r\nresources to fight poverty, hunger and \r\nunderdevelopment in Africa. They all reflect the \r\ncommitments we have entered into. \r\n Extensive consultations are under way on the \r\ndraft final document of the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, introduced \r\nby the President of the General Assembly in \r\naccordance with resolution 62/187, in preparation for \r\nthe Doha Conference to be held from 29 November to \r\n2 December 2008, seven years after the historic \r\nConference held in Monterrey, Mexico.  \r\n We therefore call on the international community \r\nto implement all of its commitments to eradicate \r\npoverty, to strengthen sustainable development, and \r\ncreate equitable and inclusive world economic systems \r\nto respond to the needs of developing countries, \r\nespecially in Africa, and enhance their integration into \r\nthe international markets.  \r\n Developed countries should end their agricultural \r\nsubsidies, especially since the MDG Africa Steering \r\nGroup emphasizes that such subsidies undermine \r\nagricultural development, a process that would \r\nfacilitate economic reform throughout the world.  \r\n Regional organizations working to establish \r\nlasting peace in Africa play a key role, especially in \r\npost-conflict countries. I appeal to all for the full \r\nimplementation of the 10-year plan for capacity-\r\nbuilding of peacekeeping forces in Africa and to \r\nstrengthen regional consultation mechanisms, in order \r\nto effectively support the African Union and its \r\nestablished programmes in the context of NEPAD.  \r\n Despite current progress, such efforts remain \r\ninadequate for low-income countries. Today, there is a \r\nneed to expand assistance for the heavily indebted \r\ncountries and to alleviate multilateral debt in order to \r\nhelp those countries perform optimally when taking on \r\nthe challenges that lie ahead. \r\n In that context, the official development \r\nassistance (ODA) provided to Africa is still lagging \r\nbehind the pledges of 2005 to raise it to $25 billion by \r\n2010. Despite the fact that some donor countries, \r\nmembers of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, have established definite plans to \r\nprovide further aid to Africa, many others have yet to \r\nhonour their commitments. We emphasize here that the \r\nquality of such assistance is just as important as the \r\nquantity. We also stress that the instability and the \r\nfluctuation of assistance is a dangerous problem for \r\nAfrica.  \r\n The creation of a peaceful environment is a sine \r\nqua non for ensuring economic and social \r\ndevelopment. We have broad experience in the field of \r\ndurable peace in the Sudan, and the wealth-sharing \r\nmeasures we have adopted are essential elements of the \r\nthree peace agreements we have signed. Perhaps the \r\nSudan’s joining of inter-African mechanisms has \r\ncleared the way for various Government agencies, as \r\nwell as all stakeholders, civil society and the private \r\nsector, to implement the aforementioned mechanisms \r\nin order to strengthen the role of women, democracy, \r\naccountability and the rule of law.  \r\n Approximately half of the world’s population is \r\nexposed to malaria. In 2006, 3.3 billion individuals \r\nsuffered from the disease, of whom 1 million have \r\nalready died. The majority of the Sudanese population \r\nis in danger of infection from malaria. There are \r\n7 million cases of the disease per year, from which \r\nthere are 35,000 deaths. Scientific studies in this area \r\nemphasize the negative effects of climate change on \r\nthe rate of incidence, given that high temperatures \r\n A/63/PV.26\r\n \r\n27 08-55210 \r\n \r\nextend the lives of the mosquitoes that carry this \r\ndisease, directly affecting the social and economic \r\ndevelopment of the country. The Sudan has therefore \r\ncreated a national strategy to fight malaria, creating a \r\nspecial entity to strengthen the means of controlling the \r\nspread of the disease, thus enabling better prevention \r\nand treatment.  \r\n The slackening of the world economy, the \r\nincrease in food prices and climate change are all \r\nfactors that prevent us from attaining concrete results \r\nin implementing NEPAD and in the fight against \r\nmalaria. Those factors jeopardize our ability to achieve \r\nthe MDGs by 2015. Thus, real determination and clear \r\nleadership are needed on the part of our development \r\npartners and the African countries themselves in order \r\nto introduce meaningful reforms to the debt and \r\ninternational trade systems, to facilitate access to the \r\nWorld Trade Organization by developing countries, and \r\nto increase ODA. All such action must be calibrated \r\nwith the national ownership and development plans of \r\ndeveloping countries, while honouring in a timely \r\nmanner the commitments that have been undertaken. \r\nThe responsibility for development is a collective \r\nresponsibility based on a just international partnership.  \r\n Mr. Raja (India): India’s first Prime Minister, \r\nJawaharlal Nehru, speaking at the Asia-Africa \r\nConference at Bandung in 1955, described Asia and \r\nAfrica as “sister continents”. That vision of India and \r\nAfrica, with our shared historical experience of fighting \r\ncolonialism and multidimensional backwardness, and \r\nour common journey with a common destination, \r\nremains at the centre of India’s links with Africa.  \r\n India, which hosted the first-ever India-Africa \r\nPartnership Forum Summit in New Delhi in April \r\n2008, is therefore extremely pleased to participate in \r\ntoday’s discussion on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD).  \r\n We would like at the outset to take note of the \r\nhigh-level meeting on the theme “Africa’s development \r\nneeds: state of implementation of various commitments, \r\nchallenges and the way forward”, held in New York on \r\n22 September 2008. We would like to take particular \r\nnote of paragraph 39 of the political declaration \r\nadopted at the meeting which stated, inter alia, that,  \r\n“All commitments to and by Africa should be \r\neffectively implemented and given appropriate \r\nfollow-up by the international community and by \r\nAfrica itself. We underscore the urgency of \r\nfinding solutions to Africa’s major challenges.” \r\n(resolution 63/1, para. 39) \r\n India would also like to echo the call of the \r\nChairman of the African Union, made at that meeting, \r\nthat Africa deserves special attention. The strides being \r\nmade by Africa in areas such as infrastructure, \r\nagriculture, health, human resources development, \r\nscience and technology and information and \r\ncommunications technology are evident. They are also \r\nportents that indicate the awakening of a giant that will \r\nimmutably transform the international political and \r\neconomic order.  \r\n The Secretary-General, in his report entitled \r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: sixth \r\nconsolidated progress report on implementation and \r\ninternational support” (A/63/206), provides details of \r\nthe progress made in the various priority areas of \r\nNEPAD and analyses the response of the international \r\ncommunity in support of NEPAD. We are particularly \r\nconcerned, in the light of the political declaration, that \r\nhe has called for urgent implementation of \r\ninternational commitments, including a reversal in the \r\ndecline of development assistance. We endorse the \r\nreminder by the Chairman of the African Union of the \r\nmoral obligation of the international community to \r\nassist Africa in pulling itself out of the poverty trap.  \r\n India has always been committed to elevating its \r\nspecial engagement with Africa into an enduring \r\npartnership. We have a long-standing, close and \r\nmultilayered relationship with Africa based on our \r\nabiding commitment to working with the continent to \r\nfulfil its aspirations. Our partnership encompasses \r\npriority sectors integral to the development goals of \r\nAfrica in the twenty-first century. A vibrant India and a \r\nresurgent Africa are witnessing an intensification of \r\nrelations and a growing convergence of interests in \r\ntheir common quest for sustainable economic growth \r\nand development.  \r\n The Delhi Declaration and the Africa-India \r\nFramework for Cooperation, adopted by India and \r\nAfrica earlier this year, highlight our shared vision and \r\nworld view. The Delhi Declaration is based on equality \r\nand mutual respect. The Framework of Cooperation, \r\nadopted at the summit, outlines the priority areas of our \r\nfuture engagement. Taken together, they provide a \r\nsound foundation for the intensification of our \r\nengagement in the years to come.  \r\n India is committed to working together with \r\nAfrica in accordance with the continent’s priorities. \r\nAreas of cooperation include capacity-building, \r\nagriculture, infrastructure development, health and \r\nfood security and technology cooperation. India also \r\nA/63/PV.26  \r\n \r\n08-55210 28 \r\n \r\nannounced the enhancement of the available \r\nconcessional lines of credit for Africa to $5.4 billion. \r\nIndia sincerely aspires to a long-term partnership with \r\nAfrica and is therefore investing in building economic \r\ninfrastructure, including railways, information \r\ntechnology, telecommunications and power.  \r\n For India, capacity-building in Africa has been an \r\narea of priority. Since 1964, through the Indian \r\nTechnical and Economic Cooperation Programme, \r\nIndia has worked with Africa to place thousands of \r\nAfrican students in professional institutions in India \r\nunder scholarship schemes. Over 15,000 African \r\nstudents are currently studying in Indian universities \r\nand colleges. India will, over the next five to six years, \r\nundertake, on a grant basis, projects in critical areas \r\nfocusing on education, science, information \r\ntechnology, agriculture and renewable energy. India \r\nnow offers a substantially higher number of training \r\nslots and has also doubled long-term scholarships. We \r\nhave allocated $500 million to that purpose.  \r\n The Pan-African e-Network Project is a shining \r\nexample of the India-Africa partnership. India has \r\ngifted a satellite dedicated to e-connectivity in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa to help bridge the digital divide. \r\nThe Project is fully financed by the Government of \r\nIndia and was launched from Addis Ababa, with a \r\nsatellite hub in Dakar. It links major universities in \r\ndifferent regions of Africa with major Indian \r\nuniversities and centres of excellence in India, and also \r\nlinks major hospitals in Africa with super-specialty \r\nhospitals in India. Thirty countries have already joined \r\nthe Project to provide quality tele-education and tele-\r\nmedicine.  \r\n The Secretary-General, in his report on NEPAD, \r\nhas called for the long-overdue successful outcome of \r\nthe Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations \r\nencompassing a development dimension. At the India-\r\nAfrica Partnership Forum Summit, India and Africa \r\ndecided to work together with the World Trade \r\nOrganization on pressing global issues of shared \r\ninterests and concerns, such as the issue of cotton \r\nsubsidies. India has made a unilateral announcement of \r\nduty- and quota-free market access to goods from \r\n34 least developed countries in Africa. That will spur \r\neconomic activity in manufacturing, particularly for \r\nAfrican small and medium-sized enterprises, by \r\nallowing them enhanced market access to one of the \r\nfastest-growing economies in the world.  \r\n India, like Africa, has been affected by the global \r\neconomic slowdown, the international economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, and higher food and oil prices. Those, \r\nas well as issues such as climate change, the reform \r\nand democratization of international institutions, the \r\nfight against terrorism, combating diseases, the \r\neradication of hunger and poverty and the promotion of \r\npluralism and democracy, are all on our common \r\nagenda.  \r\n Africa’s fight against malaria — which is dealt \r\nwith in the Secretary-General’s report (A/63/219), \r\ntransmitting the World Health Organization’s report \r\nand entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria \r\nin Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa” — \r\nremains an uphill task. Although there are signs that \r\nsome progress might be taking place, it is a fact that \r\nresources and access to treatment remain inadequate \r\nand there is no evidence of a decline of malaria in \r\nAfrica. The appearance of resistant falciparum strains \r\nis a matter of particular concern.  \r\n While a number of preventive measures, such as \r\nthe distribution of treated mosquito nets, are being \r\nundertaken, it also remains a fact that the developing \r\nworld’s ability to combat public health crises of that \r\nnature requires fundamental changes in the intellectual \r\nproperty regime. The Doha Declaration enshrines the \r\nprinciple that trade rules on patents are not as \r\nimportant as public health. Access to medicines is a \r\nfundamental part of the right to health. It is a matter of \r\nregret that this principle remains more in the realm of \r\ntheory than practice.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to state that it is our \r\nfirm conviction that success in achieving the objectives \r\nof NEPAD depends on an African-led and Africa-\r\ndeveloped agenda. With the rich human and natural \r\nresources available in Africa and the commitment of \r\nAfrica’s leaders to achieving the objectives of NEPAD, \r\nsuccess can be achieved if NEPAD receives the \r\ndedicated support of the international community in \r\nrealizing the African dream. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I wish to inform members \r\nthat, at the request of the sponsor, the consideration of \r\nitem 113, “Multilingualism”, which was scheduled for \r\nMonday, 20 October, has been postponed to a later date \r\nto be announced.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n"
