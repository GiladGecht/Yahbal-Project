We \r\nhave indeed had a number of opportunities this year — \r\nand we will have others to come — to reflect on the \r\nsituation and challenges of the African continent. \r\nSadly, the Secretary-General’s report on this item \r\nreminds us that our “attention reflects the fact that \r\nmost African countries remain off-track with respect to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals” \r\n(A/63/206, summary). \r\n The Group of 77 and China thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report for this session entitled “New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development: sixth \r\nconsolidated progress report on implementation and \r\ninternational support” (A/63/206). The Group also \r\nthanks him for the report he made available for the \r\nhigh-level meeting in September and for the \r\nrecommendations of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) Africa Steering Group. These reports \r\nand recommendations all remind us that Africa knows \r\nwhat it wants, what is required to achieve its goals; and \r\nit has begun to take significant steps in the right \r\ndirection. Indeed, the Secretary-General reminds us \r\nthat “The New Partnership for Africa’s Development is \r\nboth a vision and a policy framework for Africa in the \r\ntwenty-first century” (A/63/206, para. 3). \r\n The Secretary-General’s report before the \r\nAssembly lines up the actions taken by African \r\ncountries and organizations and the response of the \r\ninternational community, including the United Nations \r\nsystem, to support Africa’s development. Mr. John \r\nAshe, Permanent Representative of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, delivered the address of the Prime Minister of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, the Honourable Mr. Baldwin \r\nSpencer, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China to the \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting on Africa’s development \r\nneeds on 22 September 2008. The address summarized \r\nthe situation as follows: \r\n  “The development needs and challenges \r\nconfronting the African continent are well known, \r\ndeep-seated and fundamental. The international \r\ncommunity has focused on those needs and \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 2 \r\n \r\nchallenges in a number of international \r\nconferences and summits, including the \r\nMillennium Conference, the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, the \r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development and \r\nthe 2005 World Summit. There have also been a \r\nnumber of plurilateral and bilateral initiatives \r\ndirected to Africa. Africa itself has undertaken \r\nmany initiatives to further its development.  \r\n  “We have recognized that addressing \r\nAfrica’s development needs and challenges \r\nrequires internal action and very significant \r\ninternational cooperation and facilitation in the \r\nform of resources, technology and a supporting \r\ninternational environment. We have committed \r\nourselves in declarations, resolutions and plans of \r\naction to stand with Africa in the struggle to meet \r\nthose needs and overcome the challenges.” \r\n(A/63/PV.3, p.10) \r\n The Prime Minister’s address included six \r\nquestions to be asked of the international community \r\nwith regard to delivery on its commitment to Africa.  \r\n All the information available indicates a large gap \r\nbetween promise and delivery by us as an international \r\ncommunity. That gap persisted when the global \r\neconomy was in one of the longest and strongest \r\nperiods of economic growth. The Group of 77 and \r\nChina can only urge that the current crises, in \r\nparticular the financial and economic crises with their \r\ncentral initial impact in the developed countries, will \r\nnot divert attention from the long, deep and persistent \r\nplight of Africa. \r\n The Group urges us to remain conscious that the \r\nother crises — the food crisis, the energy crisis and the \r\nclimate change crisis — are having some of their worst \r\nimpacts in Africa. The global financial and economic \r\ncrises themselves will also have profound adverse \r\nimpacts on African development. Poor African \r\ncountries, with their high dependence on agricultural \r\ncommodity exports, including cotton, are among the \r\nmost adversely impacted by the failure of the global \r\ntrade negotiations and the continued application of \r\nmassive subsidies by developed countries. \r\n The Group of 77 and China shares the view \r\ncontained in the summary to the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport that turning the vision — the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development — into concrete action \r\nrequires firm resolve and clear leadership from both \r\nAfrican countries and international development \r\npartners. The Group renews its call, made through its \r\nChairman to the high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs (see A/63/PV.3), for urgency, \r\ncertainty and comprehensiveness in our response to \r\nAfrica’s development needs. The Group also expressed \r\nthe hope that, by the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly, there will be a strong mechanism in place to \r\nmonitor our commitments to support and assist Africa. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is convinced that \r\nwhat the Assembly does during the sixty-third session \r\nwill have a profound impact, not only on the success of \r\nAfrica’s vision but also on its development prospects \r\nfor a very long time. Let us find the resolve and do the \r\nright thing. \r\n Mr. Wurie (Sierra Leone): As this is the first \r\ntime that I address you, Sir, in your capacity as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, allow me to join \r\npreceding speakers in congratulating you on your \r\nelection to your new position. Let me also express my \r\ndelegation’s confidence in you and assure you of our \r\nunreserved support in successfully conducting the work \r\nof this session. \r\n My delegation aligns itself fully with the \r\nstatements made by the Ambassadors of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda and the Republic of Kenya, on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China and the African Group, \r\nrespectively. My delegation would like nonetheless to \r\nhighlight a couple of issues of national interest. Before \r\ndoing so, however, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive reports (A/63/206 and \r\nA/63/212) on the progress in the implementation of and \r\ninternational support for the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and on the \r\nrecommendations of the 1998 report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the causes of conflict and the promotion of \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa. \r\n A decade ago, the then Secretary-General \r\nsubmitted his report on the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/52/871). It is good to note \r\nthat, despite the challenges identified in the report, \r\nthere has been significant improvement in the areas of \r\nsecurity and governance in Africa. In that regard, the \r\ncontinent is exploring ways and means to restore and \r\nconsolidate peace and stability as a prerequisite for the \r\nachievement of internationally agreed development \r\ngoals and Africa’s integration into the global economy.  \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n3 08-55233 \r\n \r\n Fortunately, many volatile regions have attained \r\nsustainable levels of stability, and others have \r\nwitnessed a reduction in the level of conflict. That has \r\nbeen due to, among other things, the United Nations \r\nmultidimensional approach to peacekeeping and the \r\nrenewed commitment of the international community \r\nto confront the scourge of conflict; the transformations \r\nin the African Union and its peace and security \r\narchitecture; the establishment of the African Union \r\nPanel of the Wise; the deepening of cooperation \r\nbetween the African Union and the United Nations and \r\nsubregional organizations; and the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to provide support to \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. \r\n The continent is aware of the need to strengthen \r\ndemocratic governance and to pursue legitimate \r\ninterests and respect for human rights and the rule of \r\nlaw. To that end, the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\nis providing innovative safeguards to improve \r\ngovernance and promote accountability. Recent \r\ndevelopments in the West African subregion have \r\ngiven us cause for hope. The highly acclaimed \r\ndemocratic transition in post-conflict settings such as \r\nin Sierra Leone, among other places, is evidence of the \r\nimprovements that have been made. We are further \r\nencouraged by the developments in the Great Lakes \r\nregion and the recent post-election mediation efforts in \r\nKenya and Zimbabwe, which were encouraging signs \r\nfor the nurturing of durable peace and a stable \r\nenvironment for socio-economic recovery in Africa.  \r\n Barely three weeks ago, heads of State or \r\nGovernment, who came together here, highlighted the \r\nspecial needs of Africa and the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as high \r\npoints of the sixty-third session. That was largely due \r\nto the many unmet commitments and pledges to the \r\ncontinent over the past decade. The current global \r\neconomic meltdown and the skyrocketing costs of food \r\nand energy are seriously compromising the strides that \r\nconflict and post-conflict societies are making in the \r\nareas of peace and sustainable development. \r\nNotwithstanding those difficulties and obstacles, my \r\ndelegation remains highly hopeful that the declarations, \r\npledges and renewed commitments emanating from \r\nthose high-level discussions will be translated into \r\nconcrete action by those leaders. \r\n My delegation has consistently reminded this \r\nHouse of the need to support and step up actions and \r\nstrategies that promote the prevention of conflict rather \r\nthan engaging in expensive peacekeeping operations, \r\nwhich are often undertaken after massive destruction of \r\nlives and property in the countries concerned. In that \r\nregard, we welcome the Secretary-General’s appeal to \r\nthe international community to support the \r\ndevelopment of additional strategies, including \r\nmediation, early warning systems and other normative \r\nmechanisms for the prevention of conflict. I wish to \r\nfurther appeal for the strengthening of the continent’s \r\npeacekeeping capability through the implementation of \r\nthe African Union-United Nations Ten-Year Capacity \r\nBuilding Programme, which aims at ensuring effective \r\nplanning and implementation with regard to the \r\ncomplex and multidimensional peacekeeping \r\noperations involved. \r\n This leads me to the issue of the illicit trade in, \r\nand transfer of, small arms and light weapons, which \r\nremains crucial to those endeavours. We urge the \r\ninternational community to intensify efforts to restrict \r\narms sales and arms transfers to conflict zones by \r\nproviding support for the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States Convention on Small Arms and \r\nLight Weapons. We also appeal for adherence to, and \r\nimplementation of, the Nairobi Protocol for the \r\nPrevention, Control and Reduction of Small Arms and \r\nLight Weapons, as well as stepped up support for the \r\nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and \r\nDisarmament in Africa. \r\n Experience has shown that peace and stability \r\nconstitute vital components for development, and vice \r\nversa. Members may also agree with me that \r\nconfronting the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons is a prerequisite for effective conflict \r\nprevention. In that regard, the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community should work together to \r\nstrengthen the human and institutional capacities of \r\nAfrica in order to complement the continent’s efforts to \r\nresolve those problems. In particular, the continent \r\nshould be assisted in addressing its unsustainable \r\nexternal debt burden to enable it to generate and better \r\nreinvest its own resources to help itself. \r\n While recognizing the need for good governance \r\nto create conditions conducive to lasting peace, my \r\ndelegation would also like to reiterate the need to \r\nprovide predictable and innovative sources of \r\nfinancing and to ensure market access through the \r\nframework of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment. \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 4 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, on behalf of the Government and \r\nthe people of Sierra Leone, I would like to express my \r\nsincere gratitude to the Peacebuilding Commission, the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and the wider United Nations for \r\ntheir continued engagement on Sierra Leone. I \r\nencourage them to deepen their collaboration with my \r\ncountry, especially in implementing the Sierra Leone \r\nPeacebuilding Cooperation Framework. \r\n Mr. Al-Najem (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to participate in the discussion of \r\nthis important item on the General Assembly’s agenda, \r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD). The importance that the international \r\ncommunity attaches to the issue of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment was embodied in the high-level meeting \r\nheld on 22 September 2008, with the participation of \r\nheads of State or Government, to discuss Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs and ways to overcome challenges \r\nand difficulties hampering the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the year \r\n2015. \r\n We support the content of the Political \r\nDeclaration issued at the meeting (resolution 63/1), \r\nparticularly the renewed commitment by the heads of \r\nState and Government to strengthen their support for \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD and their emphasis on \r\nthe importance of quickly developing sustained \r\neconomic growth on a large scale. That is in addition to \r\ntheir realization, among other things, of the need to \r\nrespond to Africa’s special needs in order to set the \r\npace for the timely achievement of the MDGs. \r\n Seven years have elapsed since African leaders \r\nadopted NEPAD, an initiative that aims to achieve \r\nbalanced large-scale growth so that Africa can reduce \r\nits level of poverty and blend better into the world \r\neconomy. \r\n We are hopeful that the numerous international \r\nconferences and resolutions aiming to achieve \r\nsustainable development will help lay the foundation of \r\npartnerships between developed and developing \r\nnations. We also hope that those conferences will \r\ncontribute to the growth and stability of economic \r\nrelations, as well as provide a just and equitable basis \r\nfor international trade, in which each side bears their \r\nrespective responsibilities in fulfilment of Africa’s \r\nspecial needs. \r\n NEPAD has firmly established a principle that \r\nKuwait has always believed in, namely, that there is a \r\nclose connection between political stability and \r\nsuccessful development. In this regard, we wish to \r\ncommend the efforts of African States to incorporate \r\nthe priorities of NEPAD into their national policies and \r\ndevelopment planning as well as their efforts to create \r\na coherent institutional mechanism. \r\n We also commend their efforts to apply the \r\nconcepts of good governance, rule of law, combating \r\ncorruption and establishing transparency with a view to \r\nconsolidating democracy, since those concepts reflect \r\ndirectly on a country’s ability to achieve security, \r\nstability and sustainable development. \r\n During the past months, the world has witnessed \r\nthe emergence of new international challenges and \r\nthreats that hinder efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment in numerous countries. Most significant \r\namong them have been the increase in the price of food \r\nand basic commodities, energy prices, disarray in \r\nfinancial markets and the negative effects of climate \r\nchange. The danger of these challenges lies in their \r\nglobal impact, which transcends national borders.  \r\n These recent developments will put the \r\ninternational community behind in achieving the \r\nMDGs. We have, indeed, started to note the negative \r\neffects of these challenges on the African continent, \r\nwhich has not achieved significant progress in the \r\neradication of poverty, hunger or in combating \r\ndangerous infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS or \r\nmalaria. These recent challenges have exacerbated the \r\nsuffering of the majority of African States. \r\n In order to face these challenges, the State of \r\nKuwait has not spared any effort in continuing to \r\nprovide development assistance to developing \r\ncountries, especially to countries in Africa, through its \r\nofficial and non-official institutions. This assistance \r\nhas been a steady part of Kuwait’s foreign policy, \r\nemanating from our conviction that advancing the \r\neconomic situations of developing countries and \r\nhelping them achieve their development goals will be \r\nbeneficial to all and will expand the horizons of \r\npartnership and cooperation, further strengthening \r\ninternational trade and economic systems. \r\n Since its establishment in 1961, the Kuwait Fund \r\nfor Arab Economic Development has been providing \r\ngrants and loans to finance infrastructure projects in \r\nmany developing countries. The gross total amount of \r\neasy loans and grants has exceeded $12 billion and has \r\nbenefited more than a hundred countries, 40 per cent of \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n5 08-55233 \r\n \r\nwhich are African countries. Two years ago, Kuwait \r\ncontributed $300 million to the Islamic Development \r\nBank for combating poverty in Africa. The Fund has \r\nalso contributed to numerous rehabilitation \r\nprogrammes and is given credit for its participation in \r\nmaking the first phase of the programme to combat \r\nriver blindness a success, with a total contribution of \r\n$100 million. This is in addition to Kuwait’s \r\ncontributions to many development funds in Africa, \r\nsuch as the African Development Fund, the Arab Bank \r\nfor Economic Development in Africa and the African \r\nDevelopment Bank. \r\n In response to the suffering in many developing \r\ncountries resulting from difficult economic conditions \r\nin particular increases in food and energy prices, the \r\nState of Kuwait established the Decent Life Fund with \r\na capital of $100 million to develop and improve \r\nagricultural production in developing countries. \r\nKuwait also announced the donation of $150 million to \r\nthe fund that was established at the most recent \r\nSummit Conference of the Organization of Petroleum \r\nExporting Countries in Riyadh, dedicated to \r\nconducting research and studies in the fields of energy, \r\nenvironment and climate change. \r\n In this regard, we stress what was mentioned in \r\nthe Secretary General’s report (A/63/206), that while \r\nthe recent increase in food prices is threatening the \r\nprogress that has been made in fighting poverty, it \r\nnonetheless offers an opportunity for African countries \r\nto increase their spending on agricultural and rural \r\ndevelopment to 10 per cent of public expenditure in \r\nline with the Maputo Declaration and to launch an \r\nAfrican green revolution within the framework of the \r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme. It can also provide an opportunity for \r\nfurther regional integration. \r\n Before concluding, I would like to make the \r\nfollowing observations. First, it is of vital importance \r\nthat African countries make more efforts to promote \r\nthis initiative on a global scale and not merely focus \r\ntheir efforts on a number of donor States on a specific \r\ncontinent. Secondly, we should endeavour to create \r\nworldwide awareness in order to assist these African \r\ncountries, as well as to incorporate NEPAD in the \r\nstructures of the African Union, provide more support \r\nfor the private sector and increase awareness activities \r\ntargeting civil society. \r\n This partnership is not a temporary operation, but \r\nrather a lasting endeavour that requires patience and \r\nconstant evaluation. We welcome the leadership role of \r\nthe United Nations in mobilizing global support for \r\nthis initiative. \r\n African countries have exerted noticeable efforts \r\nto achieve stability, so as to encourage the donor \r\ncountries and the private sector to provide them with \r\nthe needed economic and technical support. It is time \r\nfor the international community to achieve greater \r\nprogress in fulfilling its commitments and for the \r\nAfrican countries to take the necessary steps that will \r\nlead to the effective implementation of the numerous \r\nprojects and programmes included in NEPAD in order \r\nto create the peaceful atmosphere needed for \r\ndevelopment to thrive. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe United Nations high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs held on 22 September evaluated the \r\nneeds and challenges of African development. The \r\nPolitical Declaration (resolution 63/1) adopted at the \r\nmeeting reflected the common will of all countries to \r\nenhance cooperation and help Africa achieve \r\ndevelopment at an early date. The United Nations high-\r\nlevel event on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) held on 25 September also devoted special \r\nattention to Africa’s achievement of the MDGs. \r\n Today, we are gathered once again to review the \r\nagenda item on African development. This review will \r\ngive us a more comprehensive understanding of the \r\nissue and put the Political Declaration on the fast track \r\ntowards implementation. \r\n In order to implement the political declaration, \r\nthe key is to remain focused and to do that, we must \r\nlisten to African voices, respect African views, \r\naccommodate African concerns and support Africa’s \r\nefforts to implement its own programmes. The New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development shows African \r\ncountries’ determination to gain strength through unity. \r\nThe support of the international community should go \r\nhand in hand with the efforts of African countries.  \r\n There are myriad ways to provide international \r\nsupport, but the following considerations are of great \r\nimportance: first, it is essential to deliver on the \r\ncommitments of assistance to Africa. The international \r\ncommunity, the developed countries in particular, \r\nshould fully honour all assistance commitments to \r\nAfrica and increase their official development \r\nassistance to 0.7 per cent of their gross national \r\nincome. The developing countries should continuously \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 6 \r\n \r\ndeepen South-South cooperation and strengthen mutual \r\nassistance with Africa. \r\n Secondly, it is essential to effectively address \r\nnew challenges. In recent years, climate change, the \r\nfood crisis, financial turbulences and rising energy \r\nprices have not only increased uncertainties in global \r\neconomic growth, but have also eroded the \r\nachievements of African countries and made it harder \r\nfor them to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. As the international community explores ways \r\nto respond to various crises and new challenges, it is \r\nimportant to better appreciate African countries’ \r\nconcerns and desires and to take more substantive \r\naction. \r\n Thirdly, it is essential to help African countries \r\nbuild their capacity. African countries have made \r\ntremendous efforts to take development into their own \r\nhands by improving their governing capabilities and \r\nincreasing their capacity and potential for independent \r\ndevelopment. The international community should \r\noffer African countries favourable conditions in debt \r\nrelief, market access and technology transfer to help \r\nthem overcome development obstacles. In the fields of \r\nglobal economy and finance and trade, it is important \r\nto provide African countries with an enabling external \r\nenvironment for their development. \r\n Fourthly, the United Nations should continue to \r\ngive priority attention to Africa. The United Nations \r\nhas played an important role in urging the international \r\ncommunity to assist Africa. It should continue its input \r\nin terms of political mobilization, resource allocation \r\nand progress monitoring to ensure that the relevant \r\ninternational consensus is truly implemented.  \r\n Peace is the foundation of development, and \r\nwithout development, peace will be fragile. The \r\nreduction and even the elimination of conflict in Africa \r\nare indispensable to the security and happiness of the \r\nAfrican people. Over the past decade, with the support \r\nof subregional, regional, and international \r\norganizations, African countries have made tremendous \r\nefforts to promote peace and stability. The United \r\nNations should continue to play an active part in \r\npromoting dispute settlement through consultation and \r\nnegotiations between the parties concerned and in \r\nsafeguarding and maintaining peace and stability in \r\nAfrica. The international community should bear in \r\nmind its overall interest in Africa’s stability and \r\nprosperity and continue to help African countries \r\ndevelop their economies, eradicate poverty, improve \r\nthe environment, promote social progress and remove \r\nthe root causes of conflicts and instability in Africa. \r\n  Mr. Cujba (Republic of Moldova), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n \r\n China is a friend and partner of Africa. It is our \r\nstrong resolve to enhance friendly cooperation with \r\nAfrican countries and to take concrete measures to \r\nsupport Africa in achieving peace and development. At \r\nthe high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs, \r\nForeign Minister Yang Jiechi outlined how China had \r\nstrengthened its cooperation with Africa and provided \r\nvarious forms of assistance to African countries under \r\nthe framework of South-South cooperation. He also \r\nexpressed China’s readiness to take continued and \r\neffective measures to support African development and \r\npromote a new type of strategic partnership between \r\nChina and Africa. We will continue to provide \r\nassistance and support to African countries in areas \r\nsuch as agriculture, education, health care, medical \r\ncare and clean energy. We will also continue to support \r\nAfrican countries in conflict prevention and settlement \r\nand peacebuilding. \r\n African people are industrious and talented. \r\nAfrica is a promising continent with huge potential. \r\nChina is ready to work with the rest of the world for \r\nlasting peace, prosperity and development in Africa. \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nexpresses its solidarity with the statements delivered \r\nby the representatives of Antigua and Barbuda and of \r\nThailand on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \r\nrespectively. Nonetheless, the Philippines wishes to \r\ndwell on some points. \r\n The 22 September 2008 high-level meeting on \r\nAfrica’s development needs and the 25 September \r\n2008 high-level meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) provided United Nations \r\nMember States with a rare opportunity to review and \r\nrevitalize their commitments to Africa. Many \r\nstatements of support and commitment were made at \r\nthat time. His Excellency Secretary of Foreign Affairs, \r\nDr. Alberto G. Romulo delivered the Philippine \r\nstatement at the meeting on Africa’s development \r\nneeds and Her Excellency President Gloria Macapagal-\r\nArroyo delivered the Philippine statement during the \r\nround table on poverty and hunger at the high-level \r\nmeeting on the MDGs. \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n7 08-55233 \r\n \r\n Those two meetings were held amidst the \r\ndevastating global impact of climate change and the \r\nfood and energy crises. The spectre of another crisis — \r\nthe financial crisis — was not yet globally felt at that \r\npoint. Thereafter, with a speed beyond imagining, the \r\nfinancial crisis hit the international financial markets. \r\nDespite bailout strategies, its catastrophic effects have \r\nyet to be played out. What we are seeing right now are \r\nbasically effects on the stock markets and the banking \r\nand financial sectors of our economies. We are not \r\nquite sure of the exact follow-on effects the financial \r\ncrisis will have on other sectors of our economies, but \r\nthe broad outlines reveal extremely difficult times \r\nahead. That means that Africa will again bear the brunt \r\nof negative consequences. \r\n For the Philippines, the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral issued in relation to Africa’s development \r\nneeds (A/63/130) provides an excellent springboard for \r\nfuture action. The Philippines has added some \r\nobservations regarding the recommendations contained \r\nin that document: we believe that with the uncertainty \r\nof the future of the World Trade Organization (WTO) \r\nDoha Round, Africa stands to suffer disproportionately \r\nas most vulnerable to global imbalances. We must \r\nachieve a breakthrough in the Doha Round, especially \r\nin the reform of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies \r\nin the developed nations.  \r\n In the meantime, the prescriptions on South-\r\nSouth cooperation can help fill the gap and should be \r\naugmented with triangular cooperation. The outcome \r\nof the recent twelfth session of the Intergovernmental \r\nFollow-up and Coordination Committee of the Group \r\nof 77 on Economic Cooperation among Developing \r\nCountries, held recently in Côte d’Ivoire, called in \r\nparticular for the adoption of a global platform for the \r\nSouth, which should be seen in the context of next \r\nyear’s United Nations High-level Conference on South-\r\nSouth Cooperation. However, such South-South \r\ninitiatives should not be considered as substitutes for \r\naid commitments.  \r\n The recommendation on expanding the current \r\ndebt sustainability framework to include middle-\r\nincome countries is a key element that the Philippines \r\nhas consistently advocated in the United Nations. In \r\nthis regard, the Philippines has proposed a debt-for-\r\nequity in MDG projects initiative, as a means not only \r\nof reducing onerous debt burdens but also of attaining \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n Perhaps the most recent pronouncement regarding \r\nthese unsettling events and how they relate to \r\ndeveloping nations, and with special reference to \r\nAfrica, takes shape in the Group of 24 (G-24) \r\nministerial communiqué of 10 October, which called \r\nfor “fundamental reform of the regulatory and \r\nsupervisory framework as well as clearer accounting \r\nrules and transparency”. The communiqué covers many \r\naspects of reform and calls for immediate action, which \r\nare echoed in the halls of the United Nations by \r\ndeveloping countries, to wit: food and fuel prices, the \r\nDoha Development Round, official development \r\nassistance commitments, reform of the Bretton Woods \r\nInstitutions, climate change and next month’s \r\nFinancing for Development conference. \r\n With specific reference to Africa’s special needs, \r\nthe G-24 ministers  \r\n “welcomed and strongly endorsed an additional \r\nchair for Sub-Saharan Africa at the World Bank \r\nGroup’s Board by adding a 25th Executive \r\nDirector position, that would substantially reduce \r\nthe number of countries represented by each \r\nelected Executive Director from the region, and \r\nhence reduce their burden.” \r\nWhat this means is that within the World Bank, the \r\nnew position would allow more attention to be given to \r\nsub-Saharan Africa’s needs. Furthermore, in the \r\ncontext of financing for development, G-24 Ministers \r\nstated: “It is imperative … that the donor community \r\nmeets its commitment to double aid resources to Africa \r\nand raise overall aid disbursements to $130 billion by \r\n2010”. \r\n The development needs of Africa are in great \r\ndanger of being sidelined or even forgotten because of \r\nthe current conspiracy — not just confluence — of \r\ncrises facing us all. No one can deny or cover up the \r\nfact that the new landscape of the global socio-\r\neconomic, financial and natural environment is being \r\nbuffeted by tempestuous forces. As a result of this \r\nconspiracy, it is difficult to grasp a clear and rational \r\napproach from the perspective of a single nation-State. \r\nWe must use the resources of multilateralism to \r\nprovide a clear, rational and equitable way forward.  \r\n The Philippines pledges to do whatever it can to \r\nhelp alleviate the pain and suffering and to share the \r\nburdens that developing countries, and especially in \r\nAfrica, must bear in the present and in the near future. \r\nTogether, as Members of the United Nations, inspired \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 8 \r\n \r\nby its goals and aspirations, strengthened by hope and \r\nfaith and moved by love, we cannot afford to fail. We \r\nmust prevail. \r\n Mr. Khan (Pakistan): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation wishes to align itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n For several consecutive years now the Assembly \r\nhas been jointly considering the progress in the \r\nimplementation of and international support for the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nand the implementation of recommendations contained \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa. We welcome this \r\npractice; it is part of the United Nations effort to \r\nspearhead the global movement to highlight Africa’s \r\nsecurity and development needs and to give them the \r\nprominence that they deserve on the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\n The international community’s resolve to renew \r\nits attention and refocus it on addressing Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs was recently manifested in the \r\nAssembly’s high-level meeting on 22 September. \r\nSeveral key messages came out of the high-level \r\nmeeting. First, the way forward for meeting Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs requires more intense, coordinated, \r\nbalanced and integrated actions to effectively \r\nimplement the development commitments made by the \r\ninternational community to comprehensively address \r\nall challenges to Africa’s development. Secondly, the \r\ncommitment to address the special needs of Africa and \r\nto strengthen support for the implementation of \r\nNEPAD was reaffirmed. Thirdly, it was recognized that \r\nAfrica is particularly challenged on account of the \r\ndangers posed by new and old threats, including the \r\nmultiple crises of food, fuel and finance. Fourthly, in \r\naddition to urgently fulfilling all official development \r\nassistance commitments, particularly for Africa, new \r\nand additional financial resources are needed to \r\naddress adaptation needs arising from the effects of \r\nclimate change. Fifthly, sustained and more intensive \r\nefforts are also needed to achieve long-term debt \r\nsustainability. \r\n The two complementary reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/63/206 and A/63/212) and the \r\nrecommendations of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals Africa Steering Group present a comprehensive \r\npicture of the progress made in promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment and peace and security in Africa over the \r\npast year. The reports also list the formidable \r\nchallenges that must be surmounted to consolidate the \r\ngains and positive trends and to make the progress \r\nirreversible.  \r\n The Secretary-General has also rightly called \r\nattention to the challenges and constraints in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD. In this regard, we \r\nparticularly welcome the actions focused on supporting \r\nAfrican regional and subregional organizations. \r\n The Secretary-General has also noted that the \r\nprogress of the past few years could be offset by new \r\nthreats and the deepening of existing crises. There is \r\nalso concern that the financial and human resources \r\nrequired to solve Africa’s multidimensional, interlinked \r\nproblems will fall far short of what is needed. Clearly, \r\nthe international community has to scale up its efforts \r\nin order to meet all commitments to generate the \r\nresources required for achieving the MDGs. \r\n Pakistan strongly feels that further bolstering \r\ninvestment, expanding trade by allowing greater \r\nmarket access to exports from Africa, and building \r\ncapacity and human resources are the most important \r\ntools for putting Africa on a fast development track. \r\nThese, we believe, should be the three main pillars of a \r\nstrategic partnership between Africa and the rest of the \r\nworld.  \r\n Pakistan has consistently supported the political \r\nand economic aspirations of Africa. We support the \r\neffective and early implementation of NEPAD. We \r\nhave also actively supported and contributed to efforts \r\nto promote durable peace and sustainable development \r\nin Africa.  \r\n Pakistan is committed to supporting United \r\nNations peace efforts in Africa. Our contribution to \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping in Africa has taken the \r\nform of a contingent of nearly 10,000 troops, which \r\ncontinues to be one of the largest two contingents \r\ndeployed in Africa during the past decade.  \r\n Pakistan also has an Africa Plan for Trade \r\nDevelopment, with bilateral trade today reaching \r\nnearly $1.8 billion annually. Furthermore, we also \r\nprovide bilateral assistance in economic, social and \r\ntechnical spheres to a number of African countries in \r\nthe context of South-South cooperation. In particular, \r\nPakistan has been successfully running a special \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n9 08-55233 \r\n \r\ntechnical assistance programme for Africa since 1986. \r\nHundreds of young African professionals from both the \r\npublic and private sectors have received training under \r\nthis programme in different fields, including public \r\nadministration, management, banking, customs, \r\naccounting and diplomacy. \r\n We are in the process of further expanding the \r\nscope and scale of our assistance and cooperation \r\nprogrammes for Africa. Our Prime Minister has \r\nconveyed his desire to help Africa replicate our \r\nprogrammes that focus on the eradication of hepatitis C, \r\nprovision of safe drinking water and low-cost housing \r\nschemes, which are being carried out as his special \r\ninitiatives in Pakistan. \r\n I wish to conclude by saying that the challenges \r\nfaced by Africa are colossal. But the opportunities, \r\nmeans and resources to address those challenges are \r\nalso immense. NEPAD presents a realistic framework \r\nfor action. The African Union is emerging as a \r\ndynamic factor promoting African ownership in \r\ntackling Africa\u0027s problems. The subregional \r\norganizations in Africa are also playing an important \r\nrole. We are hopeful that with commensurate political \r\nwill on the part of the international community, in \r\nparticular in the developed world, to faithfully \r\nimplement the commitments made, Africa can hope to \r\nrealize its full economic and political potential. \r\n Mr. Al-Asmari (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMy delegation is honoured to extend its thanks to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to the \r\nSecretary-General for holding this meeting on \r\nsub-items (a) and (b) of agenda item 57 and item 43, \r\ndealing with cooperation in the field of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). My \r\ndelegation also supports the general statement made by \r\nthe representative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n Development is one of the most important goals \r\nthat the Kingdom is trying to achieve on the \r\ninternational level. The Secretary-General’s invitation \r\nto achieve development in Africa comes as the world is \r\nfacing difficult times, including the economic crisis \r\nthat is directly affecting the economies of African \r\nStates and development in that continent. Africa has \r\nsuffered for many decades from socio-economic \r\nproblems, poverty, unemployment and bad health \r\nconditions, which require that we support development \r\nefforts to bring an end to the suffering of those States. \r\n In the framework of the efforts of the \r\nGovernment of Saudi Arabia to help poor countries \r\nalleviate poverty in them, the Kingdom participated in \r\nthe Ministerial Conference on Middle-Income \r\ncountries hosted by Spain on 1 and 2 March 2007 in \r\ncoordination with DEASA. The Saudi Fund for \r\nDevelopment allocated part of its assistance — 49 per \r\ncent of the accumulative financial commitments over \r\nthe course of the period 1975 to 2006, amounting to \r\n$7.1 billion — to combat poverty in 28 developing \r\ncountries. We also contributed funds through the \r\nIslamic Development Bank Fund to address the \r\nproblems of poverty and its effects. The Kingdom \r\ndonated $1 billion to that fund. The Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia has made annual contributions of $25 million to \r\ndevelopment programmes, including the African \r\nDevelopment Bank, to be disbursed over five years. \r\nThe Kingdom is a member of the African Development \r\nBank and supports the African Development Fund as \r\nwell as the Arab Development Bank. The Kingdom has \r\npledged $18 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria for the period of 2008 \r\nthrough 2010 at the rate of $6 million per year. We had \r\nalready transferred $10 million to that Fund. \r\n Despite the fact that it is a developing country, \r\nmy country continues its assistance to the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs). The Kingdom forgave \r\nmore than $6 billion of debts owed to it by LDCs. It \r\ndonated $500 million to the World Food Programme so \r\nthat they can grapple with the spiralling prices of basic \r\nfoodstuffs. The Kingdom contributes one billion \r\ndollars to the Fund to combat poverty in the Islamic \r\nworld, in addition to contributing to the capital funds \r\nof 18 international financial institutions. The \r\ncontributions and non-refundable assistance as well as \r\nconcessional loans submitted by Saudi Arabia in the \r\nlast three decades exceeded more than $90 billion, \r\nbenefiting 86 developing States. That amount \r\nrepresents 4 per cent of our gross national product, \r\nwhich is higher than the rate required of us by the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n In conclusion, Saudi Arabia is keenly conscious \r\nof the need to bolster NEPAD and to buttress the \r\nimplementation of international obligations to Africa in \r\na manner conducive to achieving lasting peace and \r\nsustainable development therein. \r\n Mr. Mbuende (Namibia): It gives me great \r\npleasure to participate in the debate on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa\u0027s Development: progress in \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 10 \r\n \r\nimplementation and international support. We associate \r\nourselves with the statements delivered earlier at this \r\nmeeting by Antigua and Barbuda, and by Kenya at the \r\n26th meeting, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China \r\nand the African Group, respectively.  \r\n The General Assembly is invited to take stock of \r\nthe progress made in the implementation of the African \r\ndevelopment agenda through the joint mechanism of \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa\u0027s Development \r\n(NEPAD). We are, on the one hand, called to take stock \r\nof what Africa and Africans have done through their \r\nown institutions at the national, regional and \r\ncontinental level to advance the African development \r\nagenda. This is of crucial importance because the \r\ndevelopment of Africa is in the first instance a \r\nresponsibility of Africans themselves. \r\n African countries and their institutions made \r\nprogress in areas such as infrastructure development, \r\nagriculture, health, education, environment, information \r\nand communications technology, science and \r\ntechnology, gender mainstreaming and civil society \r\ninvolvement. Notwithstanding that progress, there is \r\nstill widespread poverty and the continent is not on \r\ncourse to meet the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n The international community has recognized that \r\nAfrica has special needs that should be addressed \r\njointly with development partners. In that regard, we \r\nshould also take stock of the international community’s \r\nsupport for Africa’s development. The report of the \r\nSecretary-General indicates that of the €60 million \r\npledged for the Africa Water Facility only €19 million \r\nhas been disbursed thus far. On the other hand, official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) to Africa provided by \r\nthe Development Assistance Committee declined in \r\nreal terms in 2006, and continued its downward trend \r\nin 2007.  \r\n The situation is even worse when it comes to \r\nindividual African countries, and more so with regard \r\nto those classified as being of middle income. \r\nFurthermore, members of the G-8 are off-track in \r\nachieving their Gleneagles commitment of doubling \r\nODA to Africa by 2010 and the $60 billion pledge at \r\nthe 2007 Heiligendamm Summit to fight HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in \r\nAfrica also remains unfulfilled. Overall, the support of \r\nthe international community for Africa’s development \r\nis not encouraging. \r\n Namibia believes that foreign direct investment \r\ncan become a significant source of resource flow to the \r\nAfrican development process. To that end, like other \r\nAfrican countries, Namibia has put in place an \r\ninvestment friendly environment characterized by good \r\ngovernance and generous incentives. That notwithstanding, \r\nthe flow of foreign direct investment has not been \r\nencouraging. In 2006 Africa accounted only for 2.7 per \r\ncent of global flows of foreign direct investment. The \r\nflows of foreign direct investment in recent years were \r\nengendered by high commodity prices. They were \r\nconcentrated on the extraction of raw materials for the \r\nmarkets of industrialized countries. It has not served to \r\ntransform the basis of our economy through added \r\nvalue and industrialization. Its contribution to \r\nemployment has been limited, as operations are \r\ncapital-intensive.  \r\n More deliberate measures have to be taken to \r\nensure the transfer of technology, which can lead to the \r\ntransformation of the economic structure and \r\nindustrialization. Sustainable development is unthinkable \r\nwithout such developments. In that regard, well-\r\npackaged official development assistance, leveraged by \r\ndomestic and foreign private capital, could make a \r\nsignificant contribution to the African development \r\nagenda. \r\n Trade and greater market access have the \r\npotential to attract investments that could lead to \r\neconomic diversification and industrialization. The \r\nlack of progress in trade negotiations, especially in an \r\narea of such critical importance to Africa as \r\nagriculture, perpetuates underdevelopment and is \r\ncounterproductive to our efforts to fight poverty. \r\n We are faced with many challenges emanating \r\nfrom global crises, such as the current financial turmoil \r\nand the food and energy crises, which threaten to \r\nreverse the progress we have made to date. We cannot \r\ncontinue with an attitude of business as usual. We need \r\nto take bold measures to ensure that the burden of the \r\nfinancial turmoil is not transferred to Africa and the \r\ndeveloping world at large. We need a crisis mitigation \r\nand development finance package. Such a package \r\nshould finance all critical sectors that can drive \r\ndevelopment. Those include infrastructure, agriculture \r\nand food security, education and training, \r\nmanufacturing, health, information and communication \r\ntechnologies and entrepreneurship development.  \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n11 08-55233 \r\n \r\n Indeed, it was the political will and resolve \r\ndemonstrated through the Marshall Plan that helped \r\nEurope to recover after the Second World War. We are \r\ncurrently witnessing similar resolve in the United \r\nStates and Europe to deal with the financial crisis \r\nthrough bail-outs and other measures. We would like to \r\nsee similar commitment and passion among Africa’s \r\ndevelopment partners to overcome that continent’s \r\ndevelopment challenges. \r\n Mr. Tarragô (Brazil): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation would like to associate itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Less than one month ago in this House, a high-\r\nlevel meeting on Africa’s needs took place just prior to \r\nthe opening of the general debate of the current session \r\nof the General Assembly. A few weeks ago, we also \r\nparticipated in the high-level meeting on the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action, where we debated the benefits \r\nof trade in the promotion of the economic growth of \r\nlandlocked developing countries, half of which are in \r\nAfrica. \r\n The importance attached by Member States to the \r\ndevelopment of Africa is unquestionable. We all agree \r\non the removal of the impediments that stand in the \r\nway of the realization of the economic potential of \r\nAfrican countries, and that that should be the subject of \r\nserious commitments by all of us. In addition to \r\nmaintaining the momentum of those two other events, \r\ntoday’s meeting provides us an opportunity to take \r\nstock of our commitments and of the international \r\npartnership undertaken with African countries through \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD). \r\n In our view, NEPAD stands out vis-à-vis other \r\ninitiatives in that it emphasizes the leadership and \r\nownership of African countries in their respective \r\ndevelopment processes. That gives exceptional strength \r\nto NEPAD. If well managed and delivered, it can \r\nbecome a resounding success and an example of \r\ninternational cooperation. We also view it as an \r\nexceptional contribution to the maintenance of peace \r\non the African continent. \r\n For Brazil, NEPAD equals partnership. We have \r\nunderstood the message and set about to establish close \r\npartnerships with many African countries while using \r\nNEPAD’s economic and political objectives for \r\nguidance. Brazil views its reinforced cooperation with \r\nAfrican countries not simply as a partnership for \r\nAfrica, but a partnership with Africa. Brazilian \r\ncooperation with African countries is multifaceted and \r\nreflects the diversity of national situations and \r\ncapabilities. Nevertheless, my delegation wishes to \r\ndraw attention to four specific areas which can have a \r\nconsiderable impact on the continent’s prospects, \r\nnamely, those of health, agriculture, energy and \r\ncapacity-building. \r\n Brazil has been assisting many countries through \r\nHIV/AIDS projects, either by directly donating life-\r\nsaving drugs or by helping to establish local \r\ninfrastructure to prevent and deal with the effects of \r\nthe disease. Moreover, we have started to integrate and \r\ncoordinate an international technical cooperation \r\nnetwork to promote the transfer of technology for the \r\nproduction of antiretroviral drugs in Africa. I have the \r\npleasure to inform the General Assembly that \r\ntomorrow, during President Lula’s visit to \r\nMozambique, Mozambican authorities will inaugurate \r\nthe first phase of a plant built with the support of \r\nBrazil to produce antiretroviral drugs, which we hope \r\nwill benefit not only that country but also all of \r\nsouthern Africa. \r\n With regard to agriculture and the food crisis \r\nsituation, my delegation is very pleased to recall last \r\nyear’s establishment in Ghana of the first overseas \r\noffice of Brazil’s agricultural and livestock research \r\nagency EMBRAPA, which has played a critical role in \r\nfostering the green revolution that has taken place in \r\nBrazil over the past 30 years. Our cooperation is \r\ndemand-driven and includes projects to produce \r\ntropical fruits, cotton, rice, cashew nuts and manioc, \r\nwhich are plants of great relevance to many countries \r\nin the region. We are also envisaging trilateral \r\ncooperation in Western and Central Africa between \r\nEMBRAPA and the International Fund for Agricultural \r\nDevelopment, with the involvement of other \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\n In the field of energy, Brazil is also working with \r\nAfrica on projects for the production of clean energy \r\nand renewable sources of energy, namely, sugar cane-\r\nbased ethanol and biodiesel. The soil and climate in \r\nmany parts of Africa are suitable to producing crops to \r\nbe used for such energy products. We believe that the \r\npotential economic and social impacts of such \r\ncooperation can be far-reaching and very positive. \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 12 \r\n \r\n With regard to capacity-building, Brazil has been \r\nworking with many countries in that very critical area \r\nfor development. In response to requests by the \r\ncountries concerned, Brazil is planning to provide \r\nassistance to build professional training centres, first in \r\nPortuguese-speaking African countries and later in \r\nother countries of the continent. \r\n Finally, my delegation would like to refer to the \r\nfact that Brazil is coordinating the work of the Guinea-\r\nBissau configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nWe have taken on that coordination as part of our \r\nsolidarity with a sister country and as a contribution by \r\nBrazil to achieving NEPAD’s objective of \r\nconsolidating peace on the African continent. \r\n Mr. Lintini (Zambia): My delegation wishes to \r\ncongratulate the President on the able manner in which \r\nhe is presiding over this session. \r\n My delegation fully associates itself with the \r\nstatements delivered by the representative of Antigua \r\nand Barbuda, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nand the representative of Kenya, on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group. \r\n We wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreports (A/63/206 and A/63/212) submitted under \r\nsub-items (a) and (b) of agenda item 57, entitled “New \r\nPartnership for Africa\u0027s Development: progress in \r\nimplementation and international support” and “Causes \r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa”, as well as for the \r\ndetailed note contained in document A/63/219, \r\nsubmitted under agenda item 43, “2001-2010: Decade \r\nto Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa”. \r\n As we all know, the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is an initiative of the African \r\nUnion that provides a strategic framework for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment by promoting socio-economic development \r\nand encouraging policy measures and reforms in the \r\nareas of infrastructure, agriculture, health, education \r\nand training, information and communication \r\ntechnology, and the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\namong others. In the widest context, NEPAD is at the \r\nheart of putting Africa on the global agenda and \r\ncatalysing the involvement of African institutions in \r\nthe implementation of its various objectives and \r\nprogrammes. \r\n Zambia fully subscribes to the aims and \r\nobjectives of NEPAD. Earlier this year, Zambia signed \r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme, which is an initiative of NEPAD and the \r\nAfrican Union at the highest policy-level framework \r\nfor the development of agriculture in Africa. The \r\nZambian Government, with the participation of key \r\nstakeholders in the agricultural sector, has agreed on \r\nthat priority Programme, which will bring about the \r\nrequired higher growth in Zambia’s agricultural sector. \r\nWith a view to finding sustainable solutions, \r\nparticipants under the Programme have agreed to pay \r\nparticular attention to the escalating costs of farm \r\ninputs, especially seeds, fertilizers and fuel; the \r\nensuing reduced access to food for vulnerable \r\npopulations brought about by rising fuel and food \r\nprices; the increased use of food crops for biofuels; and \r\nthe effects of climate change. \r\n Within the framework of NEPAD, Zambia has \r\nbeen working on the Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya \r\nInterconnector Power Project, which will facilitate the \r\ninterregional power trade and interconnect the \r\nSouthern African Power Pool to the East African Power \r\nPool, thereby facilitating greater regional cooperation \r\nand integration. It is expected that, when the first phase \r\nof the project is completed, in 2012, it will facilitate \r\nthe transfer of some 200 megawatts of electric power \r\nbetween eastern and southern Africa, with a further 200 \r\nmegawatts coming on line later on, thereby bringing \r\nthe total to 400 megawatts by 2014. Estimated to cost \r\njust under $800 million, Zambia is seeking financing \r\nfor the project, which will benefit from the generation \r\ncapacity currently being developed. \r\n At this point I would like to focus on malaria, \r\nwhich continues to be the number one killer disease in \r\nseveral regions of the world, particularly in many parts \r\nof Africa, including my own country of Zambia. Since \r\nthe inception of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the \r\nworld has seen the advent of the Global Fund and \r\nmany other funds and efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria. The world has also seen \r\ngrowing political will and increased financial \r\ncommitments directed at controlling malaria.  \r\n The 2006 malaria control survey estimated that \r\nan annual 247 million episodes of malaria worldwide \r\nresulted in 881,000 fatalities, with women and children \r\nbeing the most vulnerable. Many developing countries \r\nwhere malaria is endemic, including Zambia, support \r\nall the efforts made by the international community in \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n13 08-55233 \r\n \r\ncombating malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other \r\ninfectious diseases. \r\n Since 2000, the Zambian Government has \r\nidentified malaria control and prevention as an urgent \r\nhealth priority. The Government has consequently \r\nimplemented the Roll Back Malaria Strategy at the \r\ncountry level since 2001. The Strategy sets the target of \r\nachieving 60 per cent coverage for access to \r\ninsecticide-treated bed nets and preventive medicines \r\nby 2008. As stated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, other targets achieved by my country include \r\nrelatively high ownership and use of insecticide-treated \r\nbed nets. In addition, indoor spraying and the provision \r\nof preventive and life-saving medicines have made \r\nZambia a world leader in the fight against malaria. \r\n The effective implementation of those positive \r\nintervention programmes has resulted in saving many \r\nlives. That has been possible through the support of \r\npartnerships at the global, regional, subregional, \r\ncountry and community levels. It is encouraging to \r\nnote that our partners have continued to support our \r\nnational malaria strategy plan in order to accelerate the \r\nachievement of the Abuja targets, and indeed the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. That has contributed \r\nto donor confidence in the implementation of the \r\nnational malaria programme. \r\n As a result of those interventions, Zambia has \r\nmade significant advances in preventing and \r\ncontrolling the disease, as evidenced in the malaria \r\nindicator survey of 2008, including the following. The \r\nprevalence of the malaria parasite in children was \r\nreduced by 50 per cent between the two national \r\nmalaria surveys. Moderate to severe anaemia was \r\nreduced by more than 60 per cent between the two \r\nnational malaria surveys. Between 2002 and 2007, the \r\npercentage of Zambian households with at least one \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito net increased from 14 per \r\ncent to 60 per cent. The use of insecticide-treated \r\nmosquito nets has risen steadily, from 6.5 per cent to \r\n38 per cent for children under 5 and from 5 per cent to \r\n40 per cent for pregnant women. More than 80 per cent \r\nof pregnant women have received at least one dose of \r\npreventive medicine, with more than 65 per cent of \r\nthem having received two or more doses. Those results \r\nhave been achieved thanks to the partnerships that the \r\nMinistry of Health has established. \r\n In conclusion, the achievements to which I have \r\nreferred must be maintained. Zambia must press for \r\ngreater successes. We need to redouble our efforts so \r\nthat the country’s vision of a malaria-free nation by \r\n2015 is attained. The realization of that vision will not \r\nbe possible without the commitment of additional \r\nresources in order to respond to the challenges. In that \r\nregard, we urge the international community to fulfil \r\nits commitments to enable us to meet the goals and \r\ntargets that have been set. \r\n Ms. Núñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): First of all, my delegation would like to \r\nassociate itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n Prior to the triumph of the revolution in 1959, \r\nCuba’s neocolonial society, which was subordinate to \r\nthe interests of foreign capital, barely recognized its \r\nmixed identity or the African heritage that is deeply \r\nrooted in the material and spiritual life of the nation. \r\nThe cry for freedom from the Spanish metropolis that \r\narose on 10 October 1868 was accompanied by a \r\nhighly symbolic gesture. On the very day that Cubans \r\ntook to the battlefield to fight for the independence of \r\nthe island, Carlos Manuel de Céspedes granted \r\nfreedom to his slaves.  \r\n The historical monuments placed at the \r\nTriunvirato in Matanzas and at the El Cobre mines in \r\nSantiago de Cuba perpetuate the memory of the rebel \r\nspirit of the Lucumis, Carabalis, Congos, Gangas, \r\nMandingas, Minas, Bibis and Yorubas who, having \r\nbeen torn from their homelands, refused to accept the \r\ndestiny determined for them by the colonizers of the \r\ntime. It was only thanks to the zeal of the Cuban \r\nrevolution to build a new society that concrete \r\nexpression was given to what our national poet Nicolás \r\nGuillén called color Cubano. That phrase embodies \r\nboth what we are and what we aspire to be. Africa is an \r\ninseparable part of our existence and of our island \r\nethos. No one should therefore be surprised that Cuba \r\nhas come to the Hall today to reiterate its commitment \r\nof unqualified support to the sister nations of Africa. \r\n The most profound internationalist convictions of \r\nthe Cuban revolution have allowed our country to stand \r\nconsistently by Africa — from our unconditional \r\nsupport for anti-colonialist struggles to our cooperation \r\nprojects in numerous areas of the continent’s economic \r\nand social development. The privilege of having been \r\nable to make our humble contribution to the progress \r\nof African peoples in very different areas has been a \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 14 \r\n \r\nsource of honour and pride for us. Today, in the \r\nframework of continental integration, Cuba strongly \r\nsupports the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, the African Union — which is \r\ncontinuing to make progress in establishing its \r\ninstitutions — and other initiatives conceived by and \r\nfor Africa. \r\n My country has also pursued cooperation with the \r\ncontinent in its capacity as an observer member of the \r\nAfrican Union practically from the very establishment \r\nof that important organization. To that end, we recently \r\nsigned a comprehensive memorandum of understanding \r\nbetween our Government and the Commission of the \r\nAfrican Union. We hope that it will soon bear fruit as \r\nregards exchanges and cooperation in a great number \r\nof varied fields. \r\n At the recent high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs, world leaders reiterated their \r\nassistance commitments to the continent. Without \r\nexception, every leader recognized the enormous \r\nobstacles that the region faces in meeting the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the importance of \r\nhonouring the promises made, especially in the area of \r\nfinancing for development. If our small country, which \r\nfaces heightened challenges to its own development \r\nfrom the unjust and criminal blockade imposed against \r\nus for almost five decades, has amply demonstrated \r\nthat political will is the only thing needed to support \r\nthe efforts of the continent, what could be achieved if, \r\ninstead of empty promises, concrete actions were \r\nundertaken to benefit the region? \r\n As in the past, Cuba will continue to contribute \r\nits human capital and experience to work with many \r\nAfrican countries and regions. More than 1,900 Cuban \r\ndoctors and health technicians are working in \r\n35 African countries today. In 2007 alone, they \r\nprovided nearly 7 million medical consultations, \r\npresided over some 100,000 deliveries and performed \r\nalmost 200,000 operations. Moreover, our country is \r\npursuing its cooperation with African countries in the \r\ntraining of human capital. At present, 2,253 young \r\npeople from 45 African countries are studying in our \r\nuniversities and polytechnic institutes. To date, more \r\nthan 32,000 young Africans have graduated in various \r\nspecialties. \r\n Allow me to reiterate what was said by the First \r\nVice-President of the Council of State and Ministers of \r\nthe Republic of Cuba, who headed the Cuban \r\ndelegation to the high-level meeting on Africa to which \r\nI have referred:  \r\n “It is time to put an end to rhetoric. Africa’s \r\nplight will not be resolved by condolences, \r\nlamentations and limited charitable aid while \r\nfortunes are squandered in the North on luxuries \r\nand extravagance. There is a need for new \r\nrelations of solidarity and full cooperation with \r\nour African brothers.” \r\n The peoples of Africa understand and share the \r\nideals of justice and equity that must prevail in the \r\nworld. To that end, it is essential to establish a new \r\ninternational order, for the current one has plunged \r\n80 per cent of the world’s population into poverty and \r\nhunger. Our commitment to working tirelessly to \r\nachieve that is the message that we must convey to \r\nAfrica and to the world. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): In taking \r\nthe floor for the first time before the plenary at the \r\nsixty-third session of the General Assembly, I would \r\nlike to reiterate the congratulations of the Senegalese \r\ndelegation to the President and to all members of the \r\nBureau as well as our wishes to him for great success \r\nin discharging his duties. As affirmed from this rostrum \r\nby the President of the Republic, Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, \r\nhe can count on the full support of the representatives \r\nof Senegal. \r\n The joint debate that brings us here today on \r\nagenda items 57 (a) and 43, dealing respectively with \r\nprogress in implementation and international support \r\nof and for the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and with the Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica, is occurring at a very special time. In fact, the \r\ndebate at this sixty-third session has been replete with \r\nevents that have allowed us exhaustively to review \r\nAfrica’s needs in terms of development and to assess \r\nthe performance of the continent with regard to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). That has \r\nallowed us, among other things, to identify the major \r\nobstacles, including malaria, that are hindering Africa’s \r\nprogress as we approach 2015. \r\n While the two agenda items under discussion \r\nhave already been thoroughly debated by our heads of \r\nState and Government, that, of course, in no way \r\ndiminishes our interest in considering the two reports \r\nthat have been submitted by the Secretary-General in \r\ndocuments A/63/206 and A/63/219. \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n15 08-55233 \r\n \r\n The report on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment concludes with an observation largely \r\nshared by my delegation, namely, that significant \r\nprogress has been made in the implementation of \r\nNEPAD. The measures taken by Africa in the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism to build the “great green \r\nwall” and to establish a high-speed fibre-optic \r\nconnection among African States confirm that progress.  \r\n Regarding the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\nto date, 29 African countries have joined it, 14 of \r\nwhich are quite advanced in the relevant review \r\nprocess. Our satisfaction is all the greater since, with \r\nthe launching of the Mechanism, Africa has passed a \r\ncritical stage in its efforts to strengthen the credibility \r\nof its institutions both internally and in the eyes of the \r\ninternational community. We will thus be able to \r\ncommit our core resources and the imagination of our \r\nchildren to the rectification of our economic situation, \r\nand no longer to war or social and political upheaval. \r\n The great green wall, as explained by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal in this very Hall a \r\nfew weeks ago, constitutes a barrier that the continent \r\nhas committed to erecting to stop the desert’s advance \r\nalong 7,000 kilometres, from Dakar to Djibouti. The \r\ninnovative aspect of that NEPAD project is that each of \r\nthe countries through which the wall passes shall \r\nassume responsibility for building it on its territory by \r\nengaging or seeking the necessary resources. Senegal \r\nhas already begun to implement its part in the project. \r\n The high-speed fibre-optic network that the \r\nCyberAfrica Committee of NEPAD is working to \r\nestablish in order to reduce Africa’s digital divide is \r\nanother good example of the sound path of NEPAD, \r\nparticularly in synergizing small African \r\ntelecommunications operators and large African and \r\ninternational investors.  \r\n Those three examples do testify to progress, but \r\nlet us acknowledge that there have been many \r\ndifficulties that may ultimately jeopardize NEPAD’s \r\nchances of success. African countries note on the one \r\nhand, NEPAD’s tendency to copy the programmes of \r\nother continental bodies instead of focusing on the \r\neight priority sectors that have been selected; and, on \r\nthe other, the inoperative nature of the management \r\nstructure of the implementation committee. \r\n Africa has been well aware of such dangers and \r\nhas responded in kind by convening, on 15 April, \r\nsummit in Dakar on reorienting NEPAD objectives. \r\nThanks to the African Union summit held last July in \r\nSharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, which adopted the \r\nconclusions of the Dakar meeting, we can now say that \r\nNEPAD is once again back on track. \r\n With respect to development partners, there has \r\nalso been no lack of difficulties. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report tells us that, for many NEPAD sectors, \r\nthe support of backers is still being assessed in terms \r\nof pledges to invest and that, in cases where such \r\ncommitments have materialized, the effective \r\ncontributions have still been largely below what was \r\npromised. With the current food, fuel and financial \r\ncrises, the risk is great that the situation will \r\ndeteriorate, but we hope that decisions to be taken at \r\nthe donors conference next month in Accra and at the \r\nDoha Follow-up International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development will manage to avert the threat. \r\n However, whatever efforts are deployed both by \r\nAfrica and in terms of international support, only an \r\nAfrica free of pandemics, such as malaria, will be in a \r\nposition to derive full benefit from the opportunities \r\noffered by NEPAD. How could it be otherwise since, as \r\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) report \r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General tells us, 91 per cent \r\nof 881,000 malaria-related deaths in 2006 occurred in \r\nAfrica? Along with its heavy toll in human lives, \r\nmalaria, which mainly affects children less than five \r\nyears old and pregnant women, also places a major \r\nburden on fragile African economies, particularly in \r\nterms of reducing productivity.  \r\n In such a context, the WHO report issues an \r\nunappealable verdict in affirming that in Africa there is \r\nno evidence that cases of malaria and malaria-related \r\ndeaths have declined since 2006. The WHO \r\nconclusion, which Senegal endorses, is that in the final \r\nyear that separates us from the end of the decade, we \r\nwill need to redouble our commitments if we wish to \r\nachieve the objective of ridding Africa of the burden of \r\nmalaria by 2010. \r\n On the basis of its own experience, Senegal is of \r\nthe view that the expansion of the Millennium Villages \r\nproject throughout the continent could provide a \r\ncritical contribution. \r\n Before concluding, I would like to commend the \r\nSecretary-General for the quality of his reports on the \r\nitems on our agenda for today.  \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 16 \r\n \r\n Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): First of all, I would like to \r\njoin previous speakers in thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports covering important agenda \r\nitems intertwined with the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) brought before us for our \r\ndeliberation today. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Kenya on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group and of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China. \r\n My delegation wishes to make its statement on \r\nthe two major issues being considered within this \r\ncluster: progress in implementation and international \r\nsupport of NEPAD and the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa, and the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica. Allow me to present our perspectives on both \r\nissues. \r\n To begin with, my delegation appreciates the \r\nSecretary-General’s report under agenda item 60 (b), \r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support: causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa”, as contained in \r\ndocument A/63/212. \r\n My delegation also notes with appreciation the \r\nefforts deployed by the Secretary-General, the Security \r\nCouncil, the concerned United Nations departments \r\nand the international community at large to address the \r\nroot causes of conflicts in Africa. My delegation \r\nwishes in particular to express its satisfaction and \r\nappreciation for the support provided by the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to African countries for \r\nbuilding peace and rehabilitating economic and social \r\nservices in post-conflict situations. \r\n As clearly indicated in NEPAD, addressing the \r\nroot causes of conflict, in particular social and \r\neconomic problems, is a matter of priority. In that \r\nregard, the African Union, under its peace and security \r\narchitecture, has been carrying out multifaceted \r\nactivities related to peace with a view to helping \r\nAfrican countries prevent and resolve conflicts. \r\n My delegation, in that connection, wishes to note \r\nwith satisfaction the encouraging support which the \r\nAfrican Union’s peacekeeping forces are getting from \r\nthe United Nations. African peacekeeping capacity \r\nneeds to be further strengthened with continued all-\r\nround support from the United Nations system. \r\n The African Union has been playing a major role \r\nin the prevention and mediation of various conflicts in \r\nAfrica with a view to ensuring peace and security, as \r\nwell as creating an atmosphere conducive to the \r\nachievement of sustainable development throughout \r\nthe continent. \r\n The role of the African Union in that area must be \r\nfurther coordinated with the relevant organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council. \r\nEthiopia believes that such coordination and \r\ncooperation between the African Union and the United \r\nNations are indeed a matter of crucial importance. In \r\nthat regard, the United Nations needs to enhance its \r\nsupport for the African Union’s conflict prevention and \r\nmediation activities through technical and resource \r\nassistance. \r\n Ethiopia wishes to draw the attention of this \r\nAssembly to the statement contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report in paragraph 15 under the title \r\n“Ethiopia-Eritrea”, which needs some factual \r\ncorrection. The paragraph does not fully and correctly \r\nreflect the real context of the existing situation. \r\n Security Council resolution 1827 (2008), adopted \r\non 30 July and cited by the Secretary-General in this \r\nreport, does not include the phrase: “failure to accept \r\nthe rulings of the independent boundary commission”. \r\nRather, the resolution actually states:  \r\n“... regretting that Eritrea’s obstructions towards \r\nthe United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and \r\nEritrea (UNMEE) reached a level so as to \r\nundermine the basis of the Mission’s mandate and \r\ncompelled UNMEE to temporarily relocate from \r\nEritrea … and recalling the Security Council’s \r\nprevious condemnation of Eritrea’s lack of \r\ncooperation”. (Security Council resolution 1827 \r\n(2008), fifth preambular paragraph) \r\nMy delegation would therefore like to request the \r\nSecretary-General to take that into proper account and \r\ncorrect the paragraph in accordance with the resolution \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n I now turn to the other equally important agenda \r\nitem, as reported by the Secretary-General in his note \r\nin document A/63/219. \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n17 08-55233 \r\n \r\n Some current scientific statistics inform us that \r\nover 2,000 people die per day worldwide from malaria. \r\nMore worryingly, however, is that, even as we speak, \r\nmalaria is reported to kill one African child every \r\n30 seconds. In fact, malaria is already labelled one of \r\nthe three top killer diseases in the world today. It is \r\ntrue that the majority of the world’s poor live in places \r\nwhere malaria and related socio-economic instabilities \r\nprevail. As a result, the issue has kept on attracting \r\nworldwide attention, particularly among developing \r\nand least developed countries that remain the most \r\naffected by that killer disease. \r\n Most of the malaria-affected African countries, \r\nwhich are said to number approximately 42 and where \r\nmalaria has reached a severe chronic stage, are \r\nbelieved to have virtually no access to and low \r\ncapacity to make effective use of the various medicines \r\navailable to combat and roll back the disease. \r\n Ethiopia, like other malaria-endemic countries in \r\nAfrica, bears the heaviest burden of the scourge. Fifty-\r\ntwo million of our people live in malaria-risk areas and \r\nare exposed to its widespread infection. About 75 per cent \r\nof Ethiopian territory is prone to malaria. Although the \r\nprevalence of malaria is largely seasonal, it sometimes \r\naffects new places in the form of an epidemic. \r\n Cognizant of the severe negative socio-economic \r\nimpact of malaria, the Government of Ethiopia has \r\nadopted a national strategy to contain the huge \r\nsocio-economic challenge posed by the disease. \r\nMalaria prevention and control in Ethiopia are guided \r\nby a five-year strategic plan developed within the \r\ncontext of the 20-year Health Sector Development \r\nProgramme and are based on the 2010 and 2015 targets \r\nof the Roll Back Malaria movement. Malaria \r\nprevention and control is also an integral part of the \r\nPlan for Accelerated and Sustainable Development to \r\nEnd Poverty, which draws on and feeds into the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals at \r\nthe national level. \r\n In order to effectively counter, steadily control \r\nand irreversibly put an end to the enormous challenge \r\nand burden of malaria, the Government of Ethiopia has \r\nadopted responsive programmes and initiatives like the \r\nMalaria Control Support Team which, as an example \r\npar excellence, is led by the Federal Ministry of Health \r\nand is composed of relevant governmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, as well as concerned \r\nbilateral and multilateral partner agencies and \r\nsocieties.  \r\n Moreover, over the past decade, the Government \r\nhas carried out a national effort in two phases. The first \r\nfive-year strategic plan, which covered the period \r\n2001-2005, was successfully completed. Over the past \r\nfive years, the task of malaria control has been the \r\ncentral focus of the country’s comprehensive health \r\nstrategy. The second five-year plan, which covers the \r\nperiod 2005-2010, is aimed at further decreasing the \r\nmalaria burden by at least 50 per cent. \r\n Thanks to those proactive measures taken by the \r\nGovernment, which also include increased malaria \r\ndiagnosis and treatment, the proportion of infection \r\nand mortality rates resulting from malaria has been \r\nsignificantly reduced. In the past five years, the \r\nnumber of deaths caused by malaria has also been \r\nreduced, as have the prevalence and coverage of the \r\ndisease. The number of patients seeking malaria \r\ntreatment has decreased by 67 per cent. Likewise, the \r\nnumber of patients admitted to hospitals due to malaria \r\nhas decreased by 54 per cent. \r\n Taken together, those data have made Ethiopia \r\none of the most successful countries in combating the \r\nomnipotent challenges of malaria, as indicated by \r\nProfessor Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University at the \r\nhigh-level event on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals only a couple of weeks ago here at the United \r\nNations as part of this sixty-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Against the background of such encouraging \r\ndevelopments, however, one thing has to be \r\nre-emphasized before this Assembly — the need to \r\nfurther strengthen international solidarity and \r\ncollaboration in the broad endeavour to stop and \r\neffectively control the alarming advance of malaria as a \r\nglobal threat to development. Even though the tireless \r\nefforts of Governments at their respective national \r\nlevels are vital to the achievement of the desired \r\nsuccess in that field, the continued assistance of the \r\nUnited Nations and our development partners, as well \r\nas other concerned stakeholders, remains of crucial \r\nimportance. \r\n In conclusion, on behalf of my delegation I would \r\nlike to call upon all stakeholders, particularly the \r\ndeveloped countries and the various pertinent \r\ninternational organizations, including the United \r\nNations, to increase and redouble the financial and \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 18 \r\n \r\ntechnical assistance necessary to help further intensify \r\nthe ongoing fight against malaria and to do more in the \r\narea of capacity-building programmes with a view to \r\nuplifting developing and least-developed countries, \r\nparticularly those on the worst affected continent, \r\nAfrica, in the shared spirit of this Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): First of all, please allow me to congratulate \r\nthe Secretary-General on the reports that he has \r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly under items 57 (a) \r\nand 57 (b) of the agenda on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) (A/63/206) and on the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa (A/63/212). \r\nWithin those congratulations, I wish to include all the \r\nUnited Nations staff who work night and day for the \r\nwell-being of Africa.  \r\n Cameroon supports the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Kenya and of Antigua and Barbuda \r\non behalf of the Group of African States and the Group \r\nof 77 and China, respectively. \r\n The debate on the aforementioned items is taking \r\nplace only a few weeks after the high-level meeting on \r\nAfrica’s development needs held on 22 September \r\n2008. I need hardly mention that the organization of \r\nthat special meeting on Africa was in itself proof of the \r\nmixed results of the declarations of good intentions \r\nthat are constantly renewed but rarely ever made \r\nspecific. Indeed, all recent research on the situation in \r\nAfrica agrees that the continent is far from achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and \r\nabove all the development goals agreed upon at the \r\ninternational level.  \r\n Therefore, I am pleased to congratulate \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for setting up the \r\nMDG Africa Steering Group, the recommendations of \r\nwhich have the benefit of highlighting our responsibilities. \r\nThe Group advocates mobilizing $72 billion per year \r\ninternationally so that Africa can hope to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in 2015. Fulfilling that \r\nrecommendation will doubtless mean pursuing and \r\nboosting courageous action in the field of development \r\nfinancing. Indeed, the report of the Secretary-General \r\non NEPAD reminds us that official development assistance \r\ntowards Africa has actually fallen 20.5 per cent between \r\n2006 and 2007. \r\n I believe it important to stress results-oriented \r\nmanagement and the principles of predictability, \r\nharmonization and the delinking and alignment of \r\nassistance with the priority of African countries, as \r\ndefined in NEPAD. It is also highly desirable that we \r\nadopt an innovative sectoral division of resources in \r\norder to strike the right balance between the social \r\nsector, which is currently prioritized by donors, and the \r\nproductive sector, which guarantees sustainable \r\ngrowth, job creation and the improvement of \r\npurchasing power. \r\n It is true that the financial crisis affecting the \r\nworld today makes the possibility of any immediate \r\nincrease in resources allocated to Africa doubtful. \r\nHowever, we have been somewhat reassured by the \r\nstatements of Africa’s development partners at the \r\ncurrent debate and at the high-level meeting of \r\n22 September 2008. \r\n Furthermore, international support for NEPAD \r\nshould not be limited to the volume and quality of aid. \r\nIt also implies the creation of a multilateral trade \r\nsystem that is fairer and thus a change in the \r\narchitecture of international trade. An increase in the \r\nshare of African countries in world exports could \r\ngenerate substantial resources for the continent’s \r\ndevelopment. There is also a need to improve \r\nconditions that would favour the flow of private capital \r\ntowards Africa. \r\n We know that an increase in foreign direct \r\ninvestment is conditioned by the need for peace and \r\nsecurity. In that regard, we welcome the ever-\r\nincreasing assumption of responsibility by the African \r\nUnion, subregional organizations and countries in \r\npeacekeeping and in the prevention and resolution of \r\nconflict. \r\n We also note the support of the United Nations \r\nfor such organizations and welcome the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1809 (2008), in which the \r\nSecurity Council welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal to set up an African Union-United Nations \r\npanel of distinguished persons to consider in-depth the \r\nmodalities of how to support peacekeeping operations \r\nin Africa. \r\n We believe that particular emphasis should be \r\nplaced on conflict prevention that is less costly both for \r\nStates themselves, as well as for international and \r\nregional organizations. It is in that sense that \r\nCameroon supports the rationalization and \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n19 08-55233 \r\n \r\nstrengthening of the Department of Political Affairs, \r\naimed, inter alia, at providing a stronger presence on \r\nthe ground and intensifying preventive diplomacy to \r\nmanage brewing conflicts through a network of \r\nregional bureaux in line with the desires expressed by \r\ncountries. \r\n Cameroon, like other countries in the subregion \r\nof Central Africa affected by a variety of conflicts, \r\nbelieves that the proposed subregional bureau is more \r\nnecessary than ever in that part of the world. \r\n In that context, we believe that today’s debate \r\nillustrates the need to take urgent action and once again \r\ngives us the opportunity to reaffirm that the primary \r\nresponsibility for the well-being of African populations \r\nlies with Africans themselves. That requires the \r\nadoption of realistic policies and programmes, good \r\ngovernance, fighting corruption and entrenching \r\ndemocratic values in our Governments’ list of \r\npriorities.  \r\n African countries have made that commitment \r\nwithin the framework of the African Union and \r\nNEPAD. It is true that progress still needs to be made, \r\nbut the results obtained to date are substantial, as \r\nconfirmed by the reports under consideration.  \r\n Cameroon has made NEPAD’s aims its own, as \r\nreflected in the drafting and implementation of our \r\nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy. Many actions \r\nhave been undertaken, but I will just cite two examples \r\nin the fields of education and agriculture. \r\n In the field of education, our country has set up \r\ntwo national and regional virtual universities in the \r\nframework of South-South cooperation. We have also \r\nopened a regional agricultural college and set up a free \r\nuniversity area within the framework of the Economic \r\nand Monetary Community of Central Africa.  \r\n In the field of agriculture, Cameroon has set \r\nborder markets and an agricultural bank that will \r\nfacilitate farmers’ access to credit with a view to \r\nincreasing production and storage capacity for \r\nagricultural products towards the creation of \r\nsubregional food security stockpiles. With our \r\nsubregional partners and in the framework of NEPAD, \r\nwe have embarked on a sizeable infrastructure plan to \r\nlink up the countries of the subregion.  \r\n On the other questions raised in the documents \r\nbefore us, Cameroon would like to see the next reports \r\nclearly underscore the efforts made by funds, \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies to follow up on \r\nthe directives of paragraph 28 of resolution 57/7 of \r\n2002, whereby the General Assembly requested them \r\nto strengthen further their existing coordination and \r\nprogramming mechanisms as a means of enhancing \r\nsupport to African countries in the implementation of \r\nthe New Partnership. It is also important to emphasize \r\nthe specific actions undertaken by different institutions \r\nto bolster programmes, administrative structures and \r\nbudgetary priorities for Africa. \r\n What our continent truly needs is the cooperation \r\nof all its partners in building its capacities to manage, \r\npromote and support sustainable development for the \r\nwell-being of Africans. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation welcomes this debate on the progress in \r\nimplementation and international support of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa; and on the \r\n2001-2010 Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Kenya and \r\nAntigua and Barbuda on behalf of the African Group \r\nand the Group of 77 and China, respectively. \r\n We have taken note of the Secretary-General’s \r\nreports on the items under consideration. They are \r\nparticularly instructive with respect to the many \r\nactions undertaken by Africa with the support of the \r\ninternational community to promote the establishment \r\nof vital infrastructure for its social and economic \r\ndevelopment, ensure conflict prevention and reinforce \r\nmeasures taken at various levels to build peace and \r\naccelerate recovery in post-conflict countries. \r\n We are pleased to note that genuine synergy has \r\nbeen established among the various regional, national \r\nand international actors in the pursuit, through coherent \r\nstrategies, of objectives defined in various coordinating \r\nmeetings held during the reporting period. We agree \r\nwith the Secretary-General that such coordination \r\nshould be strengthened, especially between the NEPAD \r\nsecretariat, the African Union and regional economic \r\ncommunities in order to accelerate the achievement of \r\ninfrastructure objectives called for under NEPAD. \r\n The Secretary-General’s exhaustive report on \r\nNEPAD notes ongoing initiatives in all areas under \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 20 \r\n \r\nconsideration. We are pleased with the resources \r\nmobilized, which should be freed up and appropriately \r\nutilized to stimulate momentum for progress. Such \r\nmomentum alone will allow Africa to meet the many \r\nchallenges it faces in the various areas covered by \r\nNEPAD. We are pleased to note that, in all those areas, \r\nsignificant action is being taken to meet the objectives. \r\nWe note that even Africa’s external debt has seen a \r\nsteady decline relative to export earnings  and the gross \r\nnational product over the past 10 years. \r\n The Secretary-General is right to stress \r\nworrisome situations that merit special attention with \r\nrespect to the difficulties encountered by countries in \r\nachieving their objectives due to the upheavals related \r\nto the external shocks they have experienced. The \r\ninternational community should consider taking special \r\nmeasures to help those countries to maintain a \r\nsustainable long-term debt burden. \r\n It is regrettable that Africa’s share of direct \r\nforeign investments has remained insignificant despite \r\nthe slight increase we have seen, which has benefited \r\nonly a few countries and sectors. Even that slow \r\nevolution is now in danger of being derailed by the \r\ncurrent international financial crisis, even though \r\nAfrica has made considerable efforts to implement the \r\nreforms necessary to improve the investment \r\nenvironment. \r\n We hope that voluntary political measures are \r\ntaken by Africa’s development partners to consolidate \r\nthe anticipated gains. Promoting the participation of \r\nAfrica in international trade is, from that standpoint, a \r\nnecessity. We welcome measures being contemplated \r\nfor the least developed countries under the Enhanced \r\nIntegrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical \r\nAssistance through substantial contributions to the \r\nspecial Trust Fund for that instrument. \r\n Beyond such measures, we must ensure equity in \r\nthe economic partnership agreements currently being \r\nnegotiated between the different regional groups in \r\nAfrica, which will allow us to ensure the viability of \r\ntheir economies. Emerging countries that are \r\nestablished in Africa’s trade with the outside world \r\nmust help to create a new model on the basis of \r\nreciprocal advantage and of promoting economic \r\nrationality compatible with the challenges that remain \r\nbefore Africa. \r\n We are pleased with commitments undertaken \r\nwithin such strategic meetings as the recent Fourth \r\nTokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment, the India-Africa Summit, the Africa-\r\nAmerica economic summit and the recent Africa-\r\nTurkey summit. Similarly, my delegation supports the \r\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment to promote South-South cooperation, in \r\nparticular with respect to oil-producing countries, \r\nwhich are called on to invest more of their sovereign \r\nfunds in continental infrastructure. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral welcomes the growing number of countries \r\nthat are joining the African Peer Review Mechanism. \r\n Here, Benin is pleased to belong to that group of \r\ncountries. We are even preparing to host, in Cotonou \r\nfrom 23 to 27 October 2008, the First Extraordinary \r\nSummit of the African Peer Review Mechanism Forum \r\nin order to consider the dossier of two member \r\ncountries. The Government of Benin would like to \r\nthank in advance the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, a strategic partner of the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism Forum, for its significant \r\nassistance in organizing that important meeting. It is \r\nobvious that the considerable efforts being made by \r\nAfrica to honour its commitments in the development \r\npartnership cannot have the sought-after effects unless \r\ndonors commit the promised resources.  \r\n In that regard, we are concerned about the \r\nevolving statistics for official development assistance \r\n(ODA). At the Group of Eight summit in Japan in July, \r\nindustrialized countries confirmed the commitments \r\nthey undertook in Gleneagles in 2005 to make \r\nsustained efforts to double ODA for Africa by 2010 by \r\nproviding an additional $25 billion, in order to bring \r\nthe figure to 0.7 per cent of their gross national income \r\n(GNI) by 2015. However, assistance fell from \r\n$104.4 billion, 0.31 per cent of their GNI in 2006, to \r\n$103.6 billion in 2007, 0.28 per cent of their GNI, \r\nwhich is almost $1 billion less.  \r\n In fact, we have encountered a considerable \r\ndecline in the volume of assistance. Even the President \r\nof the World Bank is concerned and emphasizes that \r\nthe current financial crisis has already had nefarious \r\neffects on the financial commitments of rich countries. \r\nTo find the enormous resources required to rescue \r\nfloundering banks, we will need to pool savings from \r\nthe rest of the world. That will mean less money for \r\ndevelopment financing, as was rightly noted by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Benin, Mr. Boni Yayi, \r\nwhen he participated in the high-level meeting on \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n21 08-55233 \r\n \r\nAfrica’s development needs held on 22 September \r\n2008, on the sidelines of the general debate of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. \r\n Africa needs investment to sustain growth and \r\nreforms. Without resources there can be no \r\ndevelopment. Reforms already offer an appropriate \r\nframework and environment for ensuring exponential \r\ngrowth of resources allocated to Africa. The crisis \r\ncannot be used to justify the decline in assistance. The \r\ndecline could, however, be exacerbated by the crisis, \r\nwhich is what we fear. Africa should not have to bear \r\nthe burden of the financial crisis. We therefore call on \r\nthe rich countries to do their utmost to meet their \r\ncommitments to Africa in a sustained fashion, applying \r\nthe measures recommended to promote the \r\neffectiveness of ODA in spite of the financial crisis.  \r\n In that way, we will maintain the momentum \r\ntowards overcoming the challenges encountered by \r\nAfrica, as demonstrated by the difficulties cited in the \r\nSecretary-General’s note on the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n(A/63/219). Those difficulties are due to a lack of \r\nresources to accelerate the protection of populations \r\nfrom the pandemic. The Secretary-General’s note refers \r\nto the net reduction of the disease in low-income \r\ncountries that have been able to distribute a large \r\nnumber of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and offer \r\nanti-malaria treatments. Those countries were thus able \r\nto reduce malaria-related morbidity by 50 per cent \r\nbetween 2000 and 2007.  \r\n Benin is making considerable efforts in that field. \r\nIn 2007, we launched a campaign to distribute \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets and to institute a \r\nnational day on 10 October. The campaign was recently \r\nlaunched again this year on the same date. The free \r\ndistribution of anti-malaria mosquito nets and \r\nmedication primarily targets children under five and \r\npregnant women. Once again, we need significant \r\nresources to continue that thrust. \r\n Africa’s mobilization for development must go \r\nhand in hand with a proactive conflict prevention \r\npolicy. My delegation welcomes the specific measures \r\ntaken at various levels to assist United Nations action \r\nin that area. Over the past few years, the United \r\nNations has established new structures to offer \r\nsystematic peacebuilding and mediation support to \r\ncountries. The General Assembly recently considered \r\nthe exhaustive report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission.  \r\n Benin reiterates here its deep appreciation for the \r\nimportant work of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund, the major beneficiaries of \r\nwhich are African countries emerging from a conflict \r\nor a deep crisis. From that perspective, we must pursue \r\nUnited Nations reform and we hope that the measures \r\nbeing contemplated to strengthen the operational and \r\nanalytic capacity of the Secretariat’s Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs will soon come into effect. The \r\nMediation Support Unit and the on-call mediation team \r\nalready established are, in and of themselves, an \r\nencouraging outline of the reform, which an African \r\ncountry like mine can only welcome. My delegation \r\nwill do its utmost to ensure its successful conclusion.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s report also emphasizes \r\nmeasures taken by the United Nations specifically to \r\nmeet the needs for peace and security in Africa. We \r\nwelcome actions to strengthen the capacities of the \r\nAfrican Union and to improve coordination and \r\ncooperation with subregional organizations. The new \r\npeace and security architecture in Africa, established in \r\nstrict conformity with the provisions of Chapter VIII of \r\nthe Charter, must be strengthened and take its rightful \r\nplace within the collective security system headed by \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n In addition to institutional support, Benin \r\nwelcomes the ongoing improvement of the strategic \r\nframework for conflict prevention and resolution, \r\nwhich emphasizes the promotion of youth employment \r\nby preparing operational country programmes, \r\nstrengthening education and training, and combating \r\nthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons in \r\norder to put an end to the climate of violence afflicting \r\na number of African countries. \r\n We need significant investment for development \r\nand not for weapons for young bandits. Prioritizing the \r\npromotion of a culture of peace alongside UNESCO is \r\na fundamental aspect of ongoing efforts.  \r\n In conclusion, Benin pleads for a dedicated \r\nfollow-up of measures that would allow Africa to \r\ncreate conditions for sustainable peace and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Mr. Hart (Nigeria): Nigeria highly appreciates \r\nthe Secretary-General’s complete and succinct reports \r\non agenda items 57 (a) and (b) and 43, now under \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 22 \r\n \r\nconsideration, and aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade on those subjects by the representatives of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda and Kenya on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China and the African Group, \r\nrespectively. \r\n The New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) no doubt remains the continent’s home-\r\ngrown model and symbol of self-help and of a \r\nsustainable development flagship. It is heartening to \r\nnote that, as per the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/63/206) on item 57 (a), Africa, through the \r\nProgramme, has made some degree of progress in \r\nsectors including infrastructure, agriculture, health, \r\neducation, environment, science and technology, \r\ninformation and communication technology and gender \r\nmainstreaming and civil society. In 2007 and 2008, \r\nthree additional countries acceded to the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism, bringing the total number of \r\nmember States that have signed up to 29. As of today, \r\neight more countries, including Nigeria, have been \r\npeer-reviewed — a sure sign that a culture of \r\naccountability, transparency, sincere self-examination \r\nand other tenets of good governance are taking root in \r\nthe continent. \r\n It is also heartening to note that the continent has, \r\nover the past year, continued to enjoy multilateral and \r\nbilateral debt relief to the extent that, by June 2008, 19 \r\nAfrican countries had reached the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative completion point and \r\nalso benefited from the debt relief package of the \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Also, according to \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment, foreign direct investment flows to the \r\ncontinent rose to a record level of $53 billion. \r\nFurthermore, 13 African countries have launched \r\nMillennium Villages, a step in the right direction \r\ntowards the attainment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). \r\n It is apparent that those modest achievements \r\ncould not have been possible without the support of the \r\ninternational community, the United Nations system \r\nand other development partners. Nigeria thanks Japan, \r\nthe European Union, South America and South-South \r\ncountries, such as China, India and Turkey, that have \r\nhosted summits to facilitate joint development \r\ninitiatives as well as to boost the continent’s overall \r\ndevelopment efforts.  \r\n Nigeria further thanks the United Nations system \r\nfor its unyielding commitment to strengthening the \r\nRegional Consultation Mechanism in Support of the \r\nAfrican Union and its NEPAD Programme, including \r\nthe United Nations Ten-Year Capacity-building \r\nProgramme for the African Union (AU). Also, the 2007 \r\nlaunching of the MDG Africa Steering Group by the \r\nSecretary-General readily comes to mind. \r\n With regard to item 57 (b) on the causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa, it is indeed heart-\r\nwarming that the peacekeeping efforts of the United \r\nNations, in collaboration with the AU or its subregional \r\noutfits, have helped to restore peace and order to most \r\nof the continent’s hot spots. Preventive and mediatory \r\nefforts, such as those of the Mediation Support Unit of \r\nthe Department of Political Affairs working with \r\nsimilar bodies such as the African Union Panel of \r\nEminent Persons, have in recent times helped to \r\nprevent conflicts from festering into open and tragic \r\nsores across the continent. Also most gratifying is the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which, for the period \r\nunder review, provided invaluable financial and other \r\ncritical support for countries just transiting from \r\npeacekeeping towards peace, development and \r\nprogress. Nigeria further welcomes the capacity-\r\nbuilding assistance extended to the AU by other United \r\nNations agencies. \r\n The year 2007 witnessed a decline in overseas \r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa, largely due to the \r\nphasing out of external debt relief. The pledges made \r\nin 2005 by the international community to double aid \r\nto the continent by 2010 with an additional $25 billion \r\nwere scarcely redeemed. While the Doha trade \r\nnegotiations have largely collapsed, the advanced \r\neconomies continue to indulge in unfair trade practices, \r\nsuch as distorting agricultural subsidies, to the \r\ndetriment of poor African farmers.  \r\n It is sad that, in spite of the Joint European \r\nUnion-Africa Strategy and Action Plan adopted at the \r\nEuropean Union-Africa summit in Lisbon in 2007, the \r\neconomic partnership agreements between the two \r\ngroups have made little progress. Also, in spite of the \r\nvarious inputs made to contain crises in the continent, \r\nthe basic requirements for durable peace and \r\nsustainable development are yet to be consolidated \r\nacross the continent. The Security Council therefore \r\ncontinues to invest over 60 per cent of its time in \r\nAfrica. \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n23 08-55233 \r\n \r\n As the Assembly is already aware, the \r\naforementioned problems and challenges, coupled with \r\nthe current worldwide food, energy and financial \r\ncrises, have the potential to reverse or completely wipe \r\nout the moderate development gains made so far by \r\nAfrica through NEPAD. That must not be allowed to \r\nhappen. It is on that score that Nigeria, in addition to \r\nfully endorsing the recommendations and conclusions \r\nin the Secretary-General’s reports in documents \r\nA/63/206 and A/63/212, once again urges the \r\ndeveloped countries and other development partners to \r\nresist the temptation to see debt relief as a substitute \r\nfor official development assistance. \r\n Nigeria stresses the imperative need to develop \r\nand sustain the political will to revive and ensure the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Doha Round of \r\nnegotiations. Unfair trade practices — including \r\ndistorting agricultural subsidies, high tariffs and the \r\npossible recourse to protectionism in the face of the \r\ncurrent rise in commodity prices and the financial \r\ncrisis — must be robustly resisted. Also, the ongoing \r\nnegotiations on the draft outcome document of the \r\nforthcoming Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development to Review the \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus must be \r\nguided by commitment, understanding and flexibility \r\nto meet development challenges, especially in Africa. \r\n Malaria remains a major killer disease in Africa. \r\nIts impact on Africa’s human resource capacity is a \r\nmajor hindrance to the attainment of the MDGs, and \r\nindeed to the development of Africa. Nigeria is \r\nencouraged by the international response, under the \r\nleadership of the United Nations system, to find a \r\ndurable solution. We are firmly committed to the goals \r\nof the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa. We also acknowledge \r\nthe work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria and the progress achieved so \r\nfar, especially with regard to the provision of \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets and artemisinin-based \r\ntherapy. My delegation believes that the efficacy of \r\nthose strategies could be boosted by giving equal \r\nattention to the prevention approach in order to shore \r\nup the hope of achieving a malaria-free Africa. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to call for \r\nthe cooperation of all stakeholders. In that regard, it is \r\nimperative that all hands should be on deck to show \r\npractical care for the needy and downtrodden citizens \r\nof the world. That is the only way that the political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs adopted on \r\n22 September 2008 at the level of heads of State or \r\nGovernment can be meaningful and achieved.  \r\n NEPAD is glowing testimony of Africa’s \r\ndetermination to take its destiny in its own hands and \r\nto shed the yoke of underdevelopment and of being a \r\nhaven for crises so as to take its rightful place in the \r\ncomity of nations. It therefore behoves the United \r\nNations to put in place measures, including an \r\nelaborate monitoring mechanism, to review the full and \r\ntimely implementation of all commitments related to \r\nthe continent’s development. \r\n Mr. Hamza (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nPermit me at the outset to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation of the due attention that the President has \r\ngiven to Africa since he assumed office. We are equally \r\ngrateful to the Secretary-General for putting Africa \r\nhigh on the agenda of the United Nations. We welcome \r\nthe recommendations of the Secretary-General’s \r\nMillennium Development Goals Africa Steering Group, \r\nthe political declaration on Africa’s development \r\nneeds, the Accra Agenda for Action on aid \r\neffectiveness and the outcome of the twelfth United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and \r\nby the representative of Kenya, on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group. \r\n The recent developments in the area of peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa are encouraging. As noted in the \r\nreport (A/63/212) of the Secretary-General, Africa has \r\nmade significant achievements in the reduction of \r\narmed conflicts and civil wars in the past decade. It is \r\nnotable that Africa has yet to consolidate basic \r\nconditions for sustainable peace and development. \r\nLikewise, it is evident that, despite the progress \r\nhighlighted in the report, Africa is lagging behind on \r\nseveral fronts, including in the socio-economic area, as \r\nhighlighted at the recently held high-level event on \r\nAfrica’s development needs and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n The series of current global crises further point to \r\na gloomy and challenging future. The rise in the price \r\nof food and oil, the global instability of financial \r\nmarkets and the negative impacts of climate change are \r\ncauses for growing concern as regards both \r\ndevelopment and political stability. More traumatic \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 24 \r\n \r\nstill is the possibility that there will be a resumption of \r\nconflicts as the result of the failure of the State to \r\ndeliver peace dividends in countries emerging from \r\nconflicts and the diminishing prospects for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and stability in countries that have \r\nrecorded positive growth indicators relative to \r\nprosperity and peace. \r\n Peace is an essential prerequisite for development \r\nto take off and become sustainable. The more \r\nsustainable development becomes, the higher the \r\nprospects for stability and prosperity. It is therefore \r\nlogical that poverty, social deprivation and the lack of \r\ndevelopment are among the root causes of conflict and \r\ninstability. Other causes may include gross violations \r\nof human rights, socio-economic inequality and the \r\npolitical marginalization of some groups in society. \r\n My delegation remains convinced that peace and \r\nstability in Africa will be nurtured and sustained if the \r\nconditions for development and growth are in place. \r\nOnce that is achieved, the two processes become \r\nmutually supporting and reinforcing. Under the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\ninvestment in human development and infrastructure to \r\naugment trade as an engine for growth is critical to the \r\nachievement of development and prosperity in Africa. \r\nThat is where peace, prosperity and stability are \r\nanchored. \r\n African Governments have therefore taken bold \r\nsteps in creating the conditions necessary for growth. \r\nIn line with NEPAD, our Governments have committed \r\nto work towards improving governance, harnessing \r\ndemocracy and maintaining partnerships between \r\ndomestic resources and external development inputs, \r\nsuch as official development assistance, debt \r\ncancellation and foreign direct investment. \r\n Conscious of the need for ownership of the \r\nprocess and of taking primary responsibility, the \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) was \r\ndeveloped as a tool to address governance deficits. \r\nGovernance issues have been continuously addressed \r\nthrough the APRM, and the results thus far are evident. \r\nTo date, 29 countries have acceded to the Mechanism \r\nand seven countries have already been reviewed. \r\nTanzania is in the advanced stages of preparation for its \r\nreview. That is an example of what Africa has been \r\ndoing at the national and continental levels to promote \r\nconditions conducive to political pluralism, good \r\ngovernance and the rule of law as the foundation for \r\npublic-private partnership in development. \r\n As noted in the reports, African Governments \r\nhave struggled to sustain partnerships with multilateral \r\ndonors and the private sector to secure the necessary \r\nresources for investment in infrastructure development \r\nand in the social sector, such as in the areas of health \r\nand education. There is also room for civil society, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and philanthropic \r\norganizations to complement development initiatives \r\nby Governments and their bilateral and multilateral \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\n It is undisputed that the role of donors and \r\nmultilateral institutions in facilitating and financing \r\ndevelopment projects has been important in the strides \r\nthat we have made. Debt relief, for instance, has \r\nresulted in providing African Governments with \r\nsubstantive resources to invest in health and education. \r\nHowever, investments in the critical sector of \r\ninfrastructure that would create conditions for \r\npeacebuilding and sustainable development are yet to \r\nbe fully explored and realized, as is the potential for \r\npartnership in that critical area. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General stresses the \r\nneed for African Governments to embark on \r\nappropriate institutional and policy reforms to attract \r\nprivate capital and to develop private-public \r\npartnerships for financing infrastructure projects. As \r\nmuch as we welcome the suggestion, we are also of the \r\nview that aid-for-trade is essential to enhancing the \r\ntrade capacity of developing countries. The reform of \r\nthe international trade regime under the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round is an overarching necessity in \r\nincreasing the stake of developing countries in \r\ninternational trade. \r\n As highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa demands that we deal with the \r\nsystematic causes of conflicts. In view of that premise, \r\nmy delegation would like to commend the steps that \r\nhave been taken by the Secretary-General in the areas \r\nof prevention and mediation, including the \r\nestablishment of the Mediation Support Unit. Likewise, \r\nwe would like to underscore the institutional support in \r\nterms of capacity-building provided to the African \r\nUnion and the regional security architecture in Africa. \r\n In line with the need to increase the role of good \r\noffices in mediation and to strengthen early warning \r\n A/63/PV.27\r\n \r\n25 08-55233 \r\n \r\nmechanisms such as the APRM, it is important that due \r\nattention be given to peacebuilding and post-conflict \r\nreconstruction to help countries avoid slipping back \r\ninto conflict a few years after the end of hostilities. In \r\nthat respect, my delegation wishes to commend the \r\ngood work of the Peacebuilding Commission, as \r\nreflected in its annual report (A/63/92), which was \r\nrecently presented and debated in the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n We in the Great Lakes region of Africa are about \r\nto enter a period of post-conflict reconstruction \r\nfollowing the entry into force of the Pact on Security, \r\nStability and Development in the Great Lakes Region \r\non 21 June 2008. In that respect, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the involvement of the working group of the \r\nUnited Nations Inter-Agency Task Force for the Great \r\nLakes Region in assisting the secretariat of the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \r\nwith technical aspects related to the implementation of \r\nthe programme of action enshrined in the Pact. We \r\nwould therefore like to take this opportunity to call for \r\nthe continued support of the United Nations system and \r\ninterested partners in financing reconstruction projects \r\nthrough the recently established special fund for \r\nreconstruction and development, which is to be \r\nlaunched in near future. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to assure the \r\nGeneral Assembly of its continuous support and \r\ncooperation in conflict mediation and resolution in \r\nAfrica in search of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment on the continent. \r\n Ms. Jahan (Bangladesh): Bangladesh applauds \r\nthe Secretary-General for the comprehensive reports \r\n(A/63/206, A/63/212 and A/63/219) before us today. \r\nWe align ourselves with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n The challenges that Africa faces today in the \r\nareas of poverty, hunger, malnutrition, deadly diseases, \r\nthe environment, peace and security are daunting. The \r\ncurrent global food crisis, climate change, soaring \r\nenergy prices and volatility in the international \r\nfinancial markets are making the lives of Africans even \r\nmore difficult. All those have put at high risk the \r\nsustainability of the hard-won progress achieved in \r\nfighting hunger and malnutrition in the continent. \r\n In recent years, African countries have made \r\nsome significant progress in the economic and social \r\nfields, as well as in promoting democratic processes \r\nand good governance. By adopting the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\nAfrican countries have put the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals at the centre of their development \r\nagenda. The African Peer Review Mechanism is a \r\nconcrete sign of the commitment of African countries \r\nto good governance. There has also been progress in \r\nthe area of conflict resolution and in bringing about \r\nstabilization in a number of countries in Africa. A 2007 \r\nreport of the Secretary-General states that “Africa \r\ntoday is afflicted by far fewer armed conflicts than it \r\nwas a decade ago” (A/62/204, para. 5). As Africa \r\nmarches ahead to address its own challenges, the \r\ninternational community has a moral responsibility to \r\nextend a firm hand of cooperation. \r\n Trade is critically important for Africa. The \r\ninternational community should correct the trade \r\ndistortion and expand trade opportunities for African \r\ncountries. We call upon major economies to conclude \r\nthe Doha negotiations immediately, with full \r\nimplementation of its development agenda and bearing \r\nin mind the special concerns of African and least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs).  \r\n We are also hopeful that the New Partnership for \r\nDevelopment Act being considered by the Congress of \r\nthe United States will pave the way for duty-free \r\nmarket access to the United States market for all \r\nproducts from all LDCs. Bangladesh would like to \r\nwork closely with African LDCs to ensure that that \r\ninitiative is truly non-discriminatory and pro-\r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are deeply concerned that, since 2005, the \r\nratio of official development assistance (ODA) to gross \r\nnational income of developed countries has declined to \r\n0.28 per cent. That falls far short of the pledge made by \r\nthe Group of Eight (G8) at Gleneagles to double aid to \r\nAfrica by 2010. Conditionality, unpredictability and \r\nthe earmarking of ODA are further key impediments to \r\nensuring aid effectiveness. ODA for infrastructure and \r\nproductive sectors is important to stimulate growth, \r\ngenerate employment and reduce poverty in Africa. \r\nThe countries of the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development will need to \r\nsubstantially increase their ODA to deliver on the \r\ncommitment made at the G8 summit at Gleneagles. \r\n The external debt situation remains a source of \r\nserious concern for sub-Saharan Africa and LDCs. The \r\nA/63/PV.27  \r\n \r\n08-55233 26 \r\n \r\ncurrent debt relief initiative has been slow and \r\ninadequate, in particular for countries not part of the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. There \r\nis an urgent need to ensure that all creditors, and \r\nespecially private creditors, deliver on their burden-\r\nsharing obligations. \r\n Malaria is a complex and deadly disease. \r\nApproximately 40 per cent of the world’s population, \r\nliving mostly in LDCs, is at risk of malaria. \r\nSub-Saharan Africa remains the hardest hit region, \r\nalthough malaria is endemic in many regions of the \r\nworld. In countries where the disease is particularly \r\nacute, it consumes as much as 40 per cent of \r\nGovernment health budgets. That has a crippling effect \r\non economic growth, welfare and development. \r\n We congratulate the Secretary-General on his \r\ninitiative to ensure universal coverage for malaria \r\ntreatment by the end of 2010. That is no doubt a \r\nsignificant undertaking. Successful research and \r\ndevelopment for long-term control and eradication \r\nefforts will remain critically important. The \r\ninternational community must also increase investment \r\nin developing new and improved technologies to \r\ncontrol malaria, especially effective drugs, insecticides \r\nand vaccines. We also urge developed countries to \r\nensure access to essential malaria medicines through \r\nthe transfer of technology. \r\n Bangladesh has been an active and ardent \r\nproponent of peace and development in Africa. There \r\nhas hardly been a United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmission in Africa in the past two and half decades in \r\nwhich Bangladesh has not participated. Currently, \r\naround 10,000 Bangladeshis are working in 12 United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions. We send our \r\npeacekeepers even to the highest risk areas. We do so \r\nin line with our deep commitment to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and in a spirit of solidarity with our \r\nAfrican brethren. Our blue-helmeted soldiers have \r\nbeen working shoulder to shoulder with our brothers in \r\nAfrica to restore peace in that region. \r\n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nBangladesh supports the Commission’s development \r\nefforts in Burundi, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and \r\nthe Central African Republic. I would like to reiterate \r\nthe firm commitment of the Government of Bangladesh \r\nto further strengthening our support and cooperation \r\nfor the development of Africa by stabilizing peace and \r\ncreating prosperity. \r\n Within the framework South-South cooperation, \r\ncountries like Bangladesh can meaningfully contribute \r\nto Africa’s sustainable development. Over the years, \r\nBangladesh has successfully adopted a number of \r\ninnovative ideas for development, such as microcredit, \r\nnon-formal education and women’s empowerment. \r\nMicrocredit has now been replicated in around 100 \r\ncountries across the world, including many in Africa. \r\nThe Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee and \r\nGrameen, which are two of our largest \r\nnon-governmental organizations, already have a \r\npresence in Africa. We remain ready to share our \r\nexperiences with African nations. Despite our many \r\nand varied problems, Bangladesh has succeeded in \r\noutpacing our huge population growth, generally with \r\nagricultural productivity. Bangladesh is willing to \r\nshare its Green Revolution experiences with fellow \r\nLDCs, especially those in Africa.  \r\n Africa’s development cannot be achieved without \r\nthe social and economic emancipation of the majority \r\nof its long-neglected nations. We are speaking here \r\ntoday to address that challenge. We must not falter in \r\nour commitment to promoting the peace, development \r\nand prosperity of Africa.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m. \r\n"
