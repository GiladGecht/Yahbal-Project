(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 103 \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly will now \r\nproceed to the election of five non-permanent members \r\nof the Security Council to replace those members \r\nwhose term of office expires on 31 December 2008. \r\n The five outgoing non-permanent members are \r\nthe following: Belgium, Indonesia, Italy, Panama and \r\nSouth Africa. Those five States cannot be re-elected. \r\nTheir names, therefore, should not appear on the ballot \r\npapers. \r\n Apart from the five permanent members, the \r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2009 the \r\nfollowing States: Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Croatia, \r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Viet Nam. The names \r\nof those States, therefore, should also not appear on the \r\nballot papers. \r\n Of the five non-permanent members that will \r\nremain in office in the year 2009, three are from Africa \r\nand Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. Consequently, \r\npursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly \r\nresolution 1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December 1963, the \r\nfive non-permanent members should be elected \r\naccording to the following pattern: two from Africa \r\nand Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nand two from Western Europe and other States. The \r\nballot papers reflect that pattern. \r\n In accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the two States to \r\nbe elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from \r\nAfrica and one from Asia. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of \r\nseats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of \r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of those present and \r\nvoting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie \r\nvote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted \r\nballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an \r\nequal number of votes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot and there shall be no nominations. \r\n Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by \r\nthe Chairpersons of the respective regional groups of \r\nthe following. For the two vacant seats from among the \r\nAfrican and Asian States, there are three candidates, \r\nnamely, Uganda, the Islamic Republic of Iran and \r\nJapan. Of those three candidates, Uganda is an \r\nendorsed candidate.  \r\n Members are reminded that, in keeping with \r\nestablished practice, of the two States to be elected \r\nA/63/PV.28  \r\n \r\n08-55626 2 \r\n \r\nfrom Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa and \r\none from Asia. \r\n For the one vacant seat from among the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, there is one endorsed \r\ncandidate, namely, Mexico. For the two vacant seats \r\nfrom among the Western European and other States, \r\nthere are three candidates, namely, Austria, Iceland and \r\nTurkey.  \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers that have been distributed. \r\n May I ask representatives to write clearly on the \r\nballot papers marked “A”, for the African and Asian \r\nStates, the names of the two States for which they wish \r\nto vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the name of the one \r\nState for which they wish to vote; and on the ballot \r\npapers marked “C”, for the Western European and \r\nother States, the names of the two States for which they \r\nwish to vote. \r\n A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains \r\nmore names of Member States from the relevant region \r\nthan the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will \r\nalso be declared invalid if all the names of the Member \r\nStates on that ballot do not belong to the relevant \r\nregion. If a ballot paper contains names of Member \r\nStates that do not belong to that region, the ballot \r\nremains valid, but only the names of the Member \r\nStates that belong to the relevant region will be \r\ncounted. The names of Member States that do not \r\nbelong to that region will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Stone \r\n(Australia), Ms. Del Águila-Castillo (Guatemala), \r\nMs. Kiruthu (Kenya), Ms. Beshimova (Kyrgyzstan), \r\nMr. Zilgalvis (Latvia) and Mr. Mallia (Malta) \r\nacted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and resumed \r\nat 11.40 a.m. \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A — African and Asian States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   192 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   192 \r\nAbstentions:     1 \r\nNumber of Members voting:  191 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  128 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Uganda     181 \r\n Japan     158 \r\n Iran (Islamic Republic of)  32 \r\n Madagascar    2 \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   192 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   192 \r\nAbstentions:     6 \r\nNumber of Members voting:  186 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  124 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Mexico     185 \r\n Brazil     1 \r\n Group C — Western European and other States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:   192 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   192 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of Members voting:  192 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  128 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Turkey     151 \r\n Austria     133 \r\n Iceland     87 \r\n Australia     1 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nthe following States were elected members of the \r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning \r\n1 January 2009: Austria, Japan, Mexico, Turkey \r\nand Uganda.  \r\n A/63/PV.28\r\n \r\n3 08-55626 \r\n \r\n The President: I congratulate the States that have \r\nbeen elected members of the Security Council, and I \r\nthank the tellers for their assistance in this election. \r\n This concludes our consideration of sub-item (a) \r\nof agenda item 103. \r\nThe meeting rose at 11.45 a.m. \r\n"
