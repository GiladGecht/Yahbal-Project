(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 57 and 43 (continued) \r\n \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support \r\n \r\n (a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and international \r\nsupport \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/206) \r\n \r\n (b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/212) \r\n \r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/219) \r\n \r\n Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statements made by Antigua \r\nand Barbuda at the 27th meeting and Kenya at the \r\n26th meeting on behalf of the Group of 77 and China \r\nand the Group of African States, respectively. \r\n I would like to extend my gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports on progress in \r\nimplementation of and international support for the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\n(A/63/206), and the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/63/212), and for his note \r\nentitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa” (A/63/219). \r\n Regarding progress in implementation of and \r\ninternational support for NEPAD, Rwanda welcomes \r\nthe adoption of the political declaration (resolution \r\n63/1) at the conclusion of the high-level meeting on \r\nAfrica’s development needs on 22 September 2008, as \r\nwell as the recommendations of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Africa Steering Group. We firmly \r\nbelieve that, if implemented, they offer Africa a way \r\nforward in addressing the many challenges we face. \r\n Rwanda is committed to addressing her peculiar \r\ndevelopment challenges under the umbrella of NEPAD \r\nand through the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and other internationally \r\nagreed development goals, and we have undertaken a \r\nnumber of initiatives to realize those commitments. \r\n Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Rwanda places information and communication \r\ntechnology (ICT) at the heart of its development \r\nstrategy. The Kigali protocol, signed in Kigali on \r\n29 August 2006, is the protocol on the policy and \r\nregulatory framework for the NEPAD ICT broadband \r\ninfrastructure network. The protocol came into force on \r\n13 February 2008 and will guide the implementation of \r\nthe NEPAD ICT broadband infrastructure network, \r\ncomprised of Uhurunet — the submarine segment — \r\nand Umojanet — the terrestrial segment — in order to \r\nprovide quality and affordable telecommunications \r\nconnectivity to Eastern and Southern Africa and to the \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 2 \r\n \r\nrest of the African continent. This network will be a \r\nmajor step towards interconnecting the African \r\ncontinent and helping to bridge the digital divide. We \r\ntherefore urge those countries that have yet to ratify the \r\nKigali protocol to do so to ensure its implementation. \r\n The NEPAD e-Schools Demonstration Project — \r\nthe Demo — aims to equip African schools with \r\nappropriate ICT, equipment and apparatus to ensure \r\nthat African youth graduate from primary and \r\nsecondary schools with the relevant skills and to \r\ncontribute towards improving education on the \r\ncontinent by introducing appropriate ICT through \r\ntraining and by providing appropriate digital content to \r\nall African schools to enable them to function \r\neffectively in the information society and knowledge \r\neconomy. The e-Schools Demo is being implemented \r\nthrough the Information Society Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (INSPAD), and under INSPAD \r\nleadership, two companies — Cisco and Microsoft — \r\nhave formed a consortium in support of Rwanda. \r\n Rwanda’s African Peer Review Mechanism \r\n(APRM) country review report was published in \r\nNovember 2005. Since then we have registered \r\ntremendous progress in all the focus areas of the \r\nAPRM. \r\n On democracy and good political governance, \r\nRwanda has conducted successful elections at the local \r\nand national levels, and after our recently concluded \r\nparliamentary elections women, for the first time in \r\nhistory, hold 56 per cent of the parliamentary seats, \r\nleading not only Africa but the world. We have also \r\nregistered significant progress in decentralization and \r\nin reform of the judicial sector. \r\n On economic governance and management, \r\nRwanda is now fully compliant with the best practices \r\nfor budget transparency. We remain committed to a \r\nzero-tolerance policy on corruption and have \r\nestablished institutions to enforce that policy. There \r\nhas been significant progress in corporate governance \r\nthrough enacting corporate legislation and in \r\nsocio-economic development through our Vision 2020 \r\nand second-generation Economic Development and \r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy. \r\n The progress Rwanda and Africa have made in \r\nimplementing their commitments under NEPAD is \r\nthere for all to see. However, that progress risks being \r\neroded by the food, energy and economic crises, all of \r\nwhich impact on Africa far more than they do on any \r\nother continent. It is therefore imperative that the \r\ninternational community respond to those crises \r\npromptly and decisively through the full \r\nimplementation of the political declaration on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs (resolution 63/1) and of the \r\nrecommendations of the MDG Africa Steering Group. \r\nHowever, trade and investment are Africa’s true \r\nguarantors for economic and social development, and it \r\nis critical that the Doha Development Round resume to \r\nensure that Africa plays its rightful role in the global \r\ntrading system. \r\n Concerning causes of conflict and the promotion \r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica, Rwanda welcomes the various initiatives that \r\nhave been undertaken by the international community \r\nto prevent conflict in Africa. We particularly welcome \r\nthe partnerships between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union to prevent and respond to conflict in \r\nAfrica. I wish to emphasize that Rwanda strongly \r\nbelieves that prevention remains the best and preferred \r\nmethod to promote peace and sustainable development \r\nin Africa. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report (A/63/212) paints \r\nan optimistic picture of the situation in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, and we would very much wish \r\nto share his optimism. However, as recent events have \r\nshown, the situation remains far from optimistic. The \r\nfailure comprehensively to address the threat posed by \r\nthe genocidal forces of the Forces démocratiques de \r\nlibération du Rwanda and the ex-Forces armées \r\nrwandaises/Interahamwe to the people of Rwanda and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, as set out in the \r\nNairobi communiqué and in Security Council \r\nresolution 1804 (2008), has led to the perpetuation of \r\nconflict. We therefore call upon the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that the United Nations Observer \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo implement their commitments, as set out in the \r\nNairobi communiqué and Security Council resolution \r\n1804 (2008). \r\n Rwanda welcomes the partnerships that regional \r\norganizations have forged with the United Nations on \r\npeacekeeping operations, in particular the African \r\nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. \r\nRwanda remains firmly committed to its role as a \r\nmajor troop contributor to that force. \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n3 08-55671 \r\n \r\n(spoke in French)  \r\n With regard to the 2001-2010 Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica, the report transmitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s note (A/63/219) shows the progress made, \r\nespecially in Africa, in the struggle to eliminate \r\nmalaria.  \r\n The World Malaria Report indicates that Rwanda \r\nhas managed to reduce the cases of malaria by 66 per cent \r\nover a six-year period. By 2012, we aim to reach the \r\npreliminary phase of eradicating that disease, which \r\nmeans that we will then have less than one case of \r\nconfirmed malaria per 1,000 inhabitants. Our progress \r\nhas been possible particularly as a result of the \r\nfollowing actions: the promotion of massive \r\ndistribution of moderately priced long-lasting \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets, prompt and specific \r\ntreatment through appropriate artemisinin combination \r\ntherapy — ACT — medicines, the implementation of \r\nhome-based management of fever by community health \r\nworkers, control of the disease through campaigns of \r\nindoor spraying of homes, an increase in the use of \r\nhealth services, and an increase in the number of \r\nindividuals with health insurance. \r\n Rwanda remains fully committed to the fight to \r\neradicate the disease in Rwanda and Africa. \r\n Mr. Terzi de Sant’Agata (Italy): First of all, I \r\nshould like to thank the representative of France for his \r\nstatement on behalf of the European Union, with which \r\nI fully agree. I also wish to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive report on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) (A/63/206).  \r\n In its capacity as incoming President of the \r\nGroup of Eight (G8), Italy has taken note of the call \r\nmade by the President of the General Assembly — \r\nwhich was reiterated by Kenya on behalf of the African \r\nUnion and by many other colleagues, including the \r\nrepresentative of Rwanda, who just spoke — to prevent \r\nthe current turbulence in world markets from pushing \r\nAfrica’s needs off the radar screen of the international \r\ncommunity. Let me reassure the Assembly that we will \r\ndo everything in our power to that end. Indeed, this is \r\nthe time for the G8 to relaunch its partnership with \r\nAfrica and to act as a catalyst for renewed efforts at all \r\nlevels in support of NEPAD. \r\n The United Nations is the natural and necessary \r\nplace where our efforts should be coordinated and our \r\nstrategies defined, in full accordance with the vision of \r\nthe African membership. The High-Level Meeting on \r\nAfrica’s development needs was a very significant \r\nopportunity. I would like to recall that, at the \r\nG8 Summit held in Genoa seven years ago, Italy \r\nproposed an Africa Action Plan that was later approved \r\nat the G8 Summit held in Kananaskis, Canada. The \r\nplan is focused on the very same objectives that \r\nNEPAD is pursuing: an Africa free of conflicts, hunger \r\nand violations of human rights.  \r\n A collective commitment to targeted action in the \r\nareas of aid and trade was widely requested by African \r\nleaders during the High-Level Meeting. Italy intends to \r\nconvey that sense of urgency at the 2009 G8 Summit. \r\nThe elements emerging from this debate will therefore \r\nbe equally and duly reflected in our proposals for the \r\nSummit. \r\n We have taken careful note of the expectation in \r\nAfrica for enhanced resource flows. Indeed, improving \r\nthe quality of assistance is a key priority. Governance \r\nin Africa is improving at both the national and the local \r\nlevels. At the same time, assistance should become \r\nbetter coordinated and more predictable; it should be \r\nless bound to conditions. We should seek greater \r\nharmonization among donors, avoiding useless \r\nduplication. The High-Level Forum held in Accra \r\nunderscored the depth of those concerns. After the \r\nRome, Paris and Accra declarations, we see next \r\nNovember’s Doha Conference as a key opportunity for \r\nfurther progress in those areas.  \r\n The goal of a conflict-free Africa, set by the \r\nheads of State and Government of the African Union, is \r\nequally strategic. Our common denominator should \r\nremain the promotion of African ownership in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security on the continent. \r\n My Government is committed to supporting \r\nstrengthened African institutions in the areas of early \r\nwarning, preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping, \r\npeacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction. The \r\n10-year capacity-building programme for the African \r\nUnion should be seen as a keystone of the cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations, \r\nsuch as the European Union, that are active in Africa. To \r\nthat end, my Government has contributed €40 million to \r\nthe African Peace Facility. \r\n Action in the field should be supported by a clear \r\npolitical vision. That is why the decision-making \r\nprocess at the United Nations should respect and act on \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 4 \r\n \r\nthe principle of African ownership, which we recognize \r\nfor regional and subregional organizations in Africa. \r\nAs an elected member of the Security Council, my \r\ncountry is committed to abiding by that principle. We \r\nbelieve that further improvement in the cooperation \r\nbetween the Council and the main regional \r\nstakeholders would constitute a strong asset in ensuring \r\nconcrete results in the area of crisis management. The \r\njoint meeting held on 16 April 2008 between the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council and members of the \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council was a \r\nsignificant step in that process. \r\n Nevertheless, the sustainability of our policies \r\nwill depend on our success in tackling the root causes \r\nof instability. Combating extreme poverty, youth \r\nunemployment, and environmental degradation, as well \r\nas pandemics such as malaria, which undermine \r\nAfrica’s human resources, is a truly collective interest. \r\nIt is therefore essential that each member of the \r\ninternational community be fully committed to facing \r\nthose challenges. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation would like to express its support for the \r\npolitical declaration (resolution 63/1) adopted on \r\n22 September 2008 on the occasion of the High-Level \r\nMeeting on the theme “Africa’s development needs: \r\nstate of implementation of various commitments, \r\nchallenges and the way forward”. The Declaration \r\nreaffirms the belief of Member States in a prosperous \r\nfuture for Africa in which the core human values of \r\ndignity and peace are fully enshrined. \r\n Kazakhstan supports the efforts of the United \r\nNations and of the international community as a whole \r\nto mobilize resources for the implementation of \r\nprogrammes and projects within the framework of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\nwhich is considered a central agenda in the field of \r\ndevelopment for the continent. We also thank the \r\nSecretary-General for establishing the Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa to leverage international \r\nsupport for NEPAD. \r\n Substantial progress has been made globally in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nand other internationally agreed goals. However, \r\nKazakhstan notes with regret that, as we approach the \r\nmidpoint for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, specified in 2000, Africa remains the only \r\ncontinent that is lagging behind on every Goal, despite \r\na very encouraging recent rise in the rate of economic \r\ngrowth and overall improvement in the policy \r\nenvironment on the continent. \r\n Acknowledging the leading role of the United \r\nNations in the implementation of NEPAD, we believe \r\nthat the Organization and its structural divisions should \r\nreconsider their approach to the distribution of funds in \r\norder to strengthen their support for African countries \r\nin their efforts to achieve the MDGs by the specified \r\ndeadline. The recent rise in food prices is putting great \r\npressure on African economies and threatening to \r\nunravel hard-won progress in fighting hunger and \r\nmalnutrition. However, the crisis also offers a window \r\nof opportunity for increasing needed expenditures in \r\nthe area of agriculture and to remove the obstacles to \r\nan open trading system for agricultural commodities to \r\nbenefit African countries. \r\n As a landlocked country facing trade problems, \r\nwe understand Africa’s difficulties in overcoming trade \r\nbarriers that hinder the export of produce to the \r\ninternational markets and raw production-related \r\nexport. As reflected in the recent outcome document of \r\nthe High-Level Meeting on the midterm review of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action (resolution 63/2), \r\nAfrica’s infrastructure needs must be addressed in a \r\nregional manner if countries are to reap the benefits of \r\neconomies of scale, to develop intra-African trade and \r\nto enhance competition in the global economy. In that \r\nregard, the Doha Round of negotiations should \r\ndetermine the trade preferences to be granted to Africa \r\nin order to accelerate its development. \r\n As a country with an economy in transition and \r\nlarge deposits of natural resources, Kazakhstan is very \r\nwell aware of the problems faced by African countries \r\nseeking to enter the system of international economic \r\nrelations. In that regard, Kazakhstan fully supports the \r\nefforts of the Group of Eight and other donor countries \r\nto ease the debt burden through both multilateral and \r\nbilateral means, and to promote foreign direct \r\ninvestment that would enable the expansion of \r\ncapacities, the diversification and development of \r\nregional markets and the creation of a highly qualified \r\nhuman resources pool. \r\n We believe that the primary responsibility for \r\nachieving development goals remains with African \r\nGovernments, which have shown tremendous \r\nleadership in recent years. However, in order to \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n5 08-55671 \r\n \r\nachieve the MDGs, external public financing for \r\ndevelopment must be raised to $72 billion per year. \r\n In that regard, my delegation is concerned about \r\nthe decrease in official development assistance (ODA) \r\nto Africa in recent years and believes that the United \r\nNations should be playing a critical role in achieving \r\nthe Goal that addresses partnership development and in \r\nensuring that donor countries fulfil their commitments \r\non the attainment of the MDGs, especially in Africa. At \r\nthe same time, it is important not only to increase the \r\nvolume of external resources but also to improve aid \r\nquality in alignment with countries’ priorities. \r\n It is with great satisfaction that we acknowledge \r\nthe active cooperation that has been taking place in the \r\ncontext of South-South cooperation between \r\ndeveloping countries and middle-income countries. We \r\nbelieve that such cooperation will enable Africa’s \r\ndevelopment to make progress. For our part, as a \r\ncountry that could overcome its crisis stemming from \r\nits economy in transition, we are ready to cooperate \r\nwith countries from the African continent within the \r\nSouth-South cooperation framework and provide \r\ntechnical assistance in the financial and agricultural \r\nsectors, the training of experts and the diversification \r\nof the economy. \r\n Taking into consideration the unstable situation \r\non the continent that hinders well-rounded human \r\ndevelopment, we support the proposals to expand the \r\nSecurity Council to provide the maximum number of \r\nseats to African States in order to encourage greater \r\ninvolvement by those countries in the resolution of \r\npeace and security issues. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that, in fulfilling its \r\ncommitment to the continent that is appropriately \r\nnamed the cradle of humankind, the international \r\ncommunity will join efforts to help the peoples of \r\nAfrica in their quest for a decent life. \r\n Mr. Gioia (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States congratulates the members of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) on \r\ntheir continued solid performance in the \r\nimplementation of programmes that are enhancing \r\ngood governance and economic growth across Africa. \r\nWe remain a staunch supporter of NEPAD and believe \r\nthat its activities are central to fulfilling the vision that \r\neach generation should do better than the one before it, \r\nin freedom, prosperity and security. \r\n Along with good governance, infrastructure \r\ndevelopment and creating the conditions for sustained \r\nprivate investment, support for Africa’s farmers \r\nremains central to achieving poverty eradication and \r\nthe fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). As the Assembly knows, the African Union \r\nand President Bush hosted a meeting of global leaders \r\nfrom business, foundations and non-governmental \r\norganizations to help contribute to promoting food \r\nsecurity by identifying commitments to partnerships \r\nalong the agricultural value chain.  \r\n In response to the Africa Union’s commitment to \r\nfast track the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme (CAADP), the United States \r\nhas pledged to work to tackle the key barriers to the \r\nimplementation of the Programme. In addition to \r\nPresident Bush’s $5.5 billion commitment to combat \r\nhunger and promote agricultural development, United \r\nStates private-sector leaders have also responded. \r\n Monsanto has announced that it is investing \r\naround $3 million per day, or over $1 billion a year, \r\nmainly in the areas of plant breeding and \r\nbiotechnology, to develop better corn, cotton, soybeans \r\nand vegetable seeds. John Deere is focused on the \r\nexpansion of appropriate farm equipment and \r\ntechnologies to significantly improve productivity with \r\nreduced tillage. Land O’Lakes partners with farmer \r\ngroups and cooperatives in Africa to improve the \r\nincomes of poor small farmers and produce higher \r\nquality and more affordable dairy products for \r\nconsumers. The Gates Foundation is working with a \r\nwide range of partners, seeking to enhance the \r\ncomplete agricultural value chain — from planting the \r\nhighest quality seeds and improving farm management \r\npractices to bringing crops to market — and has \r\ncommitted more than $900 million to help small \r\nfarmers in Africa and South Asia boost their \r\nproductivity and incomes. \r\n Already, the Millennium Challenge Corporation \r\n(MCC), founded in 2004, has made more than half its \r\ntotal grants of $5.5 billion in agricultural and rural \r\ndevelopment, with $1.7 billion going to African \r\nagriculture alone. The Millennium Challenge \r\nCorporation has also announced a collaborative venture \r\nbetween it and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in \r\nAfrica. \r\n The United States remains committed to \r\nsupporting the NEPAD Comprehensive Africa \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 6 \r\n \r\nAgriculture Development Programme. We support the \r\nCAADP in six countries that are meeting their pledges \r\nand through the Initiative to End Hunger in Africa, \r\nwhich provides assistance in three areas: science and \r\ntechnology, linking producers to markets and reaching \r\nout to the vulnerable. Our support for the CAADP over \r\na five-year period is approximately $200 million per \r\nyear. \r\n I would like to update the General Assembly on \r\nprogress made under President Bush’s Malaria Initiative \r\n(PMI). In 2005, we pledged more than $1.2 billion \r\nthrough 2010 for 15 of the hardest hit African countries. \r\nThe PMI is partnering with host Governments, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and faith-based and \r\ncommunity groups to create access for the poorest of \r\nthe poor to indoor residual spraying to keep deadly \r\nmosquitoes at bay, distribute insecticide-treated \r\nbednets and provide preventive malaria treatment for \r\nexpectant mothers during their pregnancies.  \r\n The PMI also provides capacity-building for \r\nnational implementation strategies. After two years of \r\nimplementation, I can say that the PMI is making a \r\nsignificant impact. For example, in Zanzibar, the \r\npercentage of children who tested positive for malaria \r\ndropped from 20 per cent in 2005 to less than 1 per cent \r\ntoday. The United States has also become the largest \r\ncontributor — $2.5 billion so far — to the Global Fund \r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \r\n Finally, we thank the Secretary-General and the \r\nmembers of the Secretariat who have provided us with \r\nthe report (A/63/206) on the progress on \r\nimplementation and international support for the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. In that regard, \r\nwe urge the United Nations Development Programme \r\nto continue and enhance their support in the field for \r\nAfrican States and the implementation of NEPAD \r\nprogrammes. \r\n In sum, as shown by our commitment to the \r\nAfrican people in the areas of agriculture and the \r\ntreatment and prevention of malaria, as well as in our \r\nmany other initiatives to assist sub-Saharan Africa, the \r\nUnited States continues to stand with our African \r\npartners in achieving lasting poverty eradication and \r\nthe promise of a better life for all. \r\n Mr. Matenje (Malawi): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing my delegation’s gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the progress achieved in the \r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/63/206); his report on \r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in \r\nthe report on the causes of conflict and the promotion \r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n(A/63/212); and his note transmitting the report on the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa (A/63/219).  \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of Kenya on behalf of \r\nthe African Group and by the representative of Antigua \r\nand Barbuda on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The reports before us indicate that there are many \r\npositive developments taking place in Africa. The \r\nlaunch of the African Union and its socio-economic \r\ndevelopment programme NEPAD; increased African \r\nleadership in resolving conflicts on the continent; a \r\ngrowing commitment to people-centred development \r\nand regional integration; and an increased willingness \r\nto discuss and tackle difficult political and \r\nsocio-economic questions through the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism, and to make the necessary \r\nreforms: these are all positive trends.  \r\n Despite those positive trends, Africa still faces \r\nchallenges, including rising food and energy costs, \r\nclimate change, the failure of the Doha Development \r\nRound and the collapse of international financial \r\nmarkets. Furthermore, due to deepening poverty, \r\ncurrent economic gains being achieved on the \r\ncontinent and in individual African countries have yet \r\nto be translated into the visible wealth necessary to \r\neradicate poverty, particularly among the poorest, who \r\nlive on less than 1 dollar a day. Unless the \r\ncommitments for achieving the NEPAD’s objectives \r\nare fulfilled urgently and in full, Africa in general is \r\nunlikely to meet the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), within the agreed time \r\nframes. \r\n It is therefore no wonder that at the high-level \r\nmeeting on Africa’s development held on 22 September \r\n2008, many African leaders issued a call to address the \r\nurgent need to promote international trade, foreign \r\ndirect investment and infrastructure development in \r\nAfrica, including in the agriculture, health and \r\ntransport fields and in combating climate change. \r\nMalawi supports that call.  \r\n For its part, Malawi is currently implementing \r\nvarious agricultural initiatives, including an \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n7 08-55671 \r\n \r\nagricultural subsidy programme targeted at poor \r\nsmallholder farmers, with a view to achieving food and \r\nnutrition security and fighting poverty and hunger at \r\nthe national level. Malawi is also developing green \r\nbelts along its rivers and lakes in order to increase \r\nagricultural production to support its predominantly \r\nagro-based economy. Malawi hopes that such \r\ninitiatives will enable us to achieve MDG 1. \r\n In an effort to reduce transport costs and promote \r\naccess to international trade, Malawi, Mozambique and \r\nZambia have submitted a project to NEPAD and the \r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) to \r\nopen a water channel along the Shire river in Malawi \r\nand Mozambique and the Zambezi river in \r\nMozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe to the Indian \r\nOcean port of Chinde in Mozambique. We believe that \r\nthe Shire-Zambezi Waterway Project constitutes an \r\nurgent solution to the transport challenges faced by \r\nMalawi, Zambia and the hinterland of Mozambique in \r\naccessing international trade. This is an example of the \r\nurgent solutions to Africa’s development challenges \r\nenvisaged in paragraph 39 of the Political Declaration \r\non Africa’s development adopted at the conclusion of \r\nthe high-level meeting on Africa’s development held \r\non 22 September 2008 (resolution 63/1). Malawi \r\nwelcomes the adoption of that Declaration. \r\nAccordingly, we look forward to receiving the support \r\nof the international community in implementing the \r\nShire-Zambezi Waterway Project. \r\n In this regard, we join those who have called on \r\nthe industrialized countries to fulfil their NEPAD \r\ncommitments to increase official development \r\nassistance and make it available as soon as possible to \r\ndeveloping countries. We also call for an early \r\nresumption and conclusion of the Doha Development \r\nRound in order to give developing countries equitable \r\naccess to international trade and enable them to create \r\nthe wealth that is so badly needed to reduce poverty. \r\nWe hope that the Follow-up International Conference \r\non Financing for Development to Review the \r\nImplementation of the Monterrey Consensus will \r\npresent an opportunity for the international community \r\nto resolve the deadlock over the trade talks. \r\n Malawi recognizes that economic development in \r\nAfrica cannot be achieved without genuine peace and \r\nsecurity. Accordingly, we welcome the progress \r\nachieved so far under the auspices of the United \r\nNations to prevent new conflicts and resolve existing \r\nones in Africa. We also commend the efforts of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to foster sustainable peace \r\nand security in conflict-afflicted areas in Africa. \r\nMalawi will continue to play its part in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security as evidenced by its \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\non the continent and beyond. \r\n Malaria continues to be one of the greatest threats \r\nto Africa’s development. Its devastating effects are \r\ncompounded by tuberculosis and HIV and AIDS, which \r\naffect millions of people. It is a major public health \r\nproblem in Malawi and remains the most common \r\ncause of illness and death among children under \r\n5 years of age and expectant women. Malaria alone \r\naccounts for 40 per cent of outpatient consultations at \r\nmost health facilities in the country. To address the \r\nproblem, the Malawi Government is implementing a \r\nMalaria Strategic Plan, which it formulated in line with \r\nthe Roll Back Malaria Initiative. Under that plan, the \r\nGovernment has intensified the fight against malaria \r\nthrough measures including the distribution of \r\ninsecticide-treated bednets, particularly to mothers and \r\nchildren under 5, and the prompt and effective \r\ntreatment of malaria within 24 hours of the onset of \r\nillness. It is expected that 97 per cent of all households \r\nin our country will have at least one bednet by 2015. \r\n While preventive measures such as the \r\ndistribution of insecticide-treated bednets are most \r\nwelcome, we believe that fundamental reforms must be \r\nmade to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \r\nIntellectual Property Rights with a view to making \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and HIV drugs readily available \r\nand affordable in Africa. In addition, cross-border \r\ninitiatives should be intensified in order to make Africa \r\na malaria-free continent. \r\n In conclusion, Malawi appreciates the support it \r\nreceives in the fight against malaria from its \r\ndevelopment partners, including the United Nations \r\nand its institutions, the Global Fund and President \r\nBush’s Malaria Initiative. We also welcome the Global \r\nMalaria Action Plan announced by Mr. Ray Chambers, \r\nthe Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for \r\nMalaria. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 49/2 of \r\n19 October 1994, I now call on the observer for the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies. \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 8 \r\n \r\n Ms. Ritola (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): The International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \r\n(IFRC) is honoured to take the floor in this important \r\nannual debate. \r\n The IFRC’s approach to African development \r\nstarts from communities. We believe that sustainable \r\ndevelopment efforts should be based on enabling the \r\npoor and the vulnerable to better handle current and \r\nfuture risks. Empowering communities and making \r\nthem the centre of action is at the heart of the IFRC. \r\n Today, Africa is facing a development emergency, \r\naccumulated by the ongoing food and energy crises, \r\nclimate change and the growing intensity of natural \r\ndisasters. Those multidimensional challenges \r\ncontribute to the increasing risk potentials and make \r\nmore and more people vulnerable. The \r\nnon-achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) would further aggravate those \r\nvulnerabilities. Therefore, political will and \r\ncommitment are as essential for human development as \r\na successful pro-poor outcome in Doha. \r\n Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, as \r\nauxiliaries to their public authorities and with a \r\npresence virtually everywhere in the African continent, \r\nhave a unique capacity to work with Governments to \r\nstrengthen communities and drive development.  \r\n The role of National Societies is crucial, \r\nparticularly in mobilizing millions of trained and \r\nrespected volunteers to raise awareness on health and \r\ndisaster risks, to promote good community practices \r\nand to support improved access to water and food \r\nresources. Our approach is consistent with the view of \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) of the importance of partnership-building. \r\nNo Government or organization alone can make a \r\nsignificant difference to the challenges confronting \r\nAfrica. The value of partnerships cannot be \r\noverestimated, and they must also involve communities \r\nin order to be truly effective. \r\n The IFRC has responded to the food crisis by \r\nlaunching a five-year strategic food security framework \r\nwith 15 National Societies in southern Africa. The \r\npurpose is to scale up our efforts in the area of national \r\nfood security programming and to provide at least 20 \r\nper cent of the most vulnerable populations with \r\nlonger-term food security support to enhance their \r\nresilience.  \r\n In Mali, as an effort to combat food insecurity in \r\nthe Goundam Circle area, the Mali Red Cross has \r\nhelped to improve the prospects of 43,000 people in \r\nthe area and has given communities a new sense of \r\npurpose and hope.  \r\n In Burundi, as part of a three-year organizational \r\ndevelopment project, 30,000 volunteers have been \r\ntrained in order to ensure that, by the end of the \r\nproject, elected village committees will be supporting \r\nthe provision of community services in more than \r\n2,700 villages. The project has the generous support of \r\nthe President of the Republic and others in \r\nGovernment, who see it as a crucial step in Burundi’s \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n The IFRC’s malaria programmes, with long-life \r\ninsecticide-treated nets — more than 12 million of \r\nwhich have been distributed in malaria-endemic \r\ncountries since 2002 — have been instituted with a \r\nwide range of partners, and their results have been \r\ntruly remarkable in terms of reducing mortality and \r\nrestoring community confidence. Our Global Alliance \r\non HIV is a paradigm for returning Africa to the good \r\nhealth and prosperity that its people so richly deserve. \r\nThese are not just programmes for public health, but \r\nessential ingredients in development programming.  \r\n Those examples are partnerships at work for \r\nAfrica’s development, reflecting the IFRC’s \r\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWe are taking this debate further ourselves. The \r\nseventh Pan-African Conference of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies is convening in Johannesburg as we \r\nspeak, bringing together 53 African National Societies \r\nand observers from around the world, including \r\nGovernments and the United Nations itself. It is our \r\nhope to dedicate ourselves to a new partnership stage \r\nunder the slogan “Together for action in Africa”. We \r\nlook forward to presenting the outcomes of that \r\nimportant meeting and today express our sincere \r\nappreciation to the Government and the Permanent \r\nMission of South Africa for their consistent support for \r\nour objectives. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the observer of the Observer State of the Holy \r\nSee. \r\n Mr. Bené (Holy See): Unfortunately, the Permanent \r\nObserver of the Holy See Mission is not able to be \r\nhere, and I am making this statement on his behalf.  \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n9 08-55671 \r\n \r\n My delegation is grateful for the extensive report \r\nof the World Health Organization (see A/63/219) on the \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolution \r\n62/180, entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica”, and notes both the challenges in combating \r\nthat disease and the progress made thus far. \r\n The General Assembly’s recent decision to give \r\ngreater attention to developing countries, especially in \r\nAfrica, is a positive step in the right direction, \r\nparticularly because it recognizes that malaria can be \r\nsubstantially reduced through public awareness, \r\neducation and the committing of resources to research \r\nand treatment. Given that, over the past 15 years, there \r\nhas been an increased prevalence of the disease — \r\nwhich could well double the death rate over the next \r\n20 years — it is imperative that the international \r\ncommunity work together to fight this pandemic. \r\n Each year, between 300 million and 500 million \r\npeople contract malaria, which kills more than \r\n1 million people, with at least one death occurring \r\nevery 30 seconds. According to the World Health \r\nOrganization, 90 per cent of such deaths occur in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, and the majority of victims are \r\nchildren under 5 years of age, with nearly 3,000 \r\nchildren dying every day in that region. Furthermore, \r\nthe next-largest group of victims is composed of \r\npregnant mothers. Malaria remains a major threat to \r\nhuman security. Because of the cost of prevention and \r\ntreatment, those who live in poverty are those most \r\nsusceptible to this serious disease. \r\n A great number of committed individuals, \r\nespecially skilled health personnel, are working in \r\nprimary health centres and through various faith-based \r\norganizations in many of the most affected areas to \r\ncare for and properly treat those who have been \r\ninfected. These providers, who often go unnoticed, \r\nperform heroic acts of service by caring for those in \r\nneed. \r\n Our focus in addressing this disease must remain \r\non research, prevention and treatment. We know that a \r\nreduction in malaria transmission is achieved through \r\nprevention of mosquito bites and control of the \r\nmosquito population. From that perspective, it seems \r\nopportune to recall the Abuja Declaration, which calls \r\nfor, among other things, the development of \r\nmechanisms to facilitate the provision of reliable \r\ninformation to decision-makers at various \r\nepidemiological levels in order to enable health \r\nauthorities to devise appropriate control and \r\nsurveillance strategies. \r\n Individuals must be able to receive affordable, \r\nsafe and, where necessary, free diagnostic testing and \r\ndrugs. Proper diagnosis is available, and infected \r\nindividuals can make a full recovery if provided with \r\nadequate means. Efforts should be made so that \r\nappropriate treatment is accessible to those who are \r\nsuffering. \r\n Resources must continue to be allocated to \r\nongoing research into the development of new, safe and \r\ncost-efficient vaccines, as well as medicines to treat \r\nthose infected. Success in such endeavours will not fail \r\nto translate into a gradual reduction in the overall \r\nnumber of infections. \r\n In particular, my delegation calls attention to \r\npositive efforts to assist those in need. One is reminded \r\nof the importance of educating families and helping \r\nthem to care for their loved ones who have contracted \r\nmalaria. Many Catholic organizations are deeply \r\ninvolved in that field, with wide and directed \r\ncampaigns. Furthermore, they train community groups \r\nto educate parents and caregivers of young children \r\ninfected with malaria. \r\n Notwithstanding other serious infectious diseases \r\nsuch as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, which demand \r\nequal attention, our efforts on malaria cannot be \r\nsidelined. Clearly, the global community must remain \r\ncommitted to fighting all diseases that threaten human \r\nlives and security. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on these \r\nitems. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The President: Our debate has been wide-\r\nranging and informative and has served to sustain the \r\nmomentum within the Assembly to build understanding \r\nand support for Africa’s development. \r\n I was particularly reassured by the emphasis that \r\nspeakers gave to the deteriorating international \r\nfinancial environment in which we are working and \r\nwithin which Africa is struggling to find its rightful \r\nplace in the world. Speakers cautioned that the global \r\nfinancial crisis that is unfolding must not undermine \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 10 \r\n \r\nthe funding, the technical cooperation and the opening \r\nof markets in the North that Africans are counting on. \r\n The solidarity expressed by industrialized \r\ncountries, particularly by representatives of Europe, \r\nand the developing countries in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean and Asia and the Pacific regions, \r\nunderscores the strong commitment that has been \r\nreinforced by the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) framework. South-South \r\ncooperation is stronger than ever. The representatives \r\nfrom Africa have been clear about taking the leading \r\nrole in the complex process of bringing good \r\ngovernance, peace and security and development to all \r\nAfricans through regional and national initiatives \r\ninspired in no small part by NEPAD. \r\n NEPAD, it is pointed out, has created an effective \r\nleadership process for engaging development partners \r\non issues such as international trade arrangements, debt \r\nrelief and official development assistance (ODA). \r\nSpeakers have noted that progress will accelerate \r\nsignificantly if G8 countries reverse the decline in \r\nODA and keep their promise to double ODA to Africa \r\nby 2010. \r\n Additionally, as recommended by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, African countries should allocate \r\nmore resources towards NEPAD priorities and \r\nencourage private-sector participation in partnership \r\nprojects, particularly those public-private projects for \r\ninfrastructure. There were also recommendations to \r\nlaunch an African green revolution and improve both \r\neconomic and political governance through the \r\nincreasingly effective African Peer Review \r\nMechanism, an innovation that is recognized for \r\ncreating an enabling environment in matters of \r\ngovernance and accountability. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report on the causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa points out that \r\nAfrica has made sustained efforts to promote peace, \r\ndeepen its commitment to democratic processes and \r\ngood governance over the past 10 years. \r\n The African Union’s Peace and Security Council \r\nand other structures at the regional level are playing an \r\nincreasing role in mediating disputes between and \r\nwithin African countries. These mechanisms have also \r\nenabled Africans to address the terrible problems \r\nrelating to the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons. \r\n Still, our debate reminds us of the enormous \r\ncomplexity of the problems facing Africa. Today we \r\nhave given special attention to the report on the \r\ncampaign against malaria, which is of direct concern to \r\nhalf of the world’s people. The stark fact is that 91 per \r\ncent of the deaths from that disease are in Africa. It is \r\nimperative that donors sustain the funding required to \r\ncut this mortality rate in half by 2010 and meet the \r\nrelated objectives within the Millennium Development \r\nGoal (MDG) framework. \r\n Our debate must be seen in the broader and \r\nongoing context of the General Assembly’s special \r\nconcern for Africa. It closely follows the high-level \r\nmeeting on Africa’s development needs held on \r\n22 September and the High-level Event on the MDGs \r\nheld on 25 September, which focused again on Africa. \r\nWe will deepen the process at the Doha Review \r\nConference on Financing for Development at the end \r\nof November. \r\n Clearly the deteriorating international financial \r\nenvironment highlights the urgent need for the \r\ninternational community to develop a comprehensive \r\nstrategic plan that addresses both the unresolved causes \r\nof continuing violent conflict on the continent and the \r\nneed for a proactive approach to new issues as they \r\nemerge. As President, I am committed to work with \r\nMember States to promote such an effort. \r\n With each opportunity, we stand witness to the \r\nemergence of new African leaders who are working to \r\nensure that Africa’s development benefits Africans \r\nfirst. We clearly support this new paradigm. I think the \r\nDeputy Permanent Representative of China put it very \r\nclearly when he stated that we must listen to African \r\nvoices, respect African views, accommodate African \r\nconcerns and support Africa’s efforts to implement its \r\nown programmes. This is our collective responsibility \r\nand it is gratifying to know how seriously it is being \r\ntaken. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 57 and its sub-items (a) \r\nand (b) and agenda item 43. \r\n \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n11 08-55671 \r\n \r\nAgenda item 106 \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the commemoration of the two-\r\nhundredth anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/213) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/63/L.5) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to \r\nmake some remarks regarding our consideration of this \r\nagenda item. The abolition of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade in 1808 seems to have happened long ago, but I \r\nbelieve most of us appreciate the importance of \r\nbringing this historic event to the attention of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the world. \r\n The abolition of the slave trade, which criss-\r\ncrossed the Atlantic from Africa to Europe, Latin \r\nAmerica and North America for hundreds of years, did \r\nnot actually end slavery. However, it was an important \r\nstep towards this ban, marking one of the early \r\ndecisions by the international community to join forces \r\nto combat the brutal and enormously lucrative slave \r\ntrade. \r\n It is a tragedy that the slave trade and slavery \r\nitself continue to have deep, though largely invisible, \r\neffects on our world today. \r\n This year, on 25 March, the International Day of \r\nRemembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the \r\nTransatlantic Slave Trade was commemorated for the \r\nfirst time. I have always been an advocate of \r\nforgiveness and reconciliation. But the slave trade \r\nconstitutes one of those horrendous crimes against \r\nhumanity that many Africans have been generous \r\nenough to forgive but that none of us, anywhere in the \r\nworld, should forget. \r\n The slave trade, it is widely recognized, was an \r\ninstitution that not only devastated a continent but \r\npoisoned the roots of societies, young and old, by its \r\ncorrosive presence. We all continue to suffer the \r\nconsequences of that exploitation — obviously, some \r\nof us much more than others. \r\n In virtually all societies around the world, slavery \r\nremains with us, often invisible and tolerated on an \r\ninternational scale. \r\n Slavery was a socio-economic model that treated \r\npeople like goods, a system of social relations based on \r\ndomination and the denigrating treatment of people, \r\none of the worst forms of discrimination and social \r\nexclusion. Transatlantic slavery was for centuries a \r\nscourge in the world. Millions lost their lives in the \r\nlong march through Africa and the subsequent \r\ntransatlantic crossing. Millions were exploited under \r\nbrutal conditions, and on their shoulders and lives an \r\nalien society was built that excluded them and denied \r\nthem their status as human beings. \r\n Sixty years ago, in 1948, the General Assembly \r\nproclaimed in article 1 of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights that “All human beings are born free \r\nand equal in dignity and rights” and in article 2 that: \r\n“Everyone is entitled to all the rights and \r\nfreedoms set forth in this Declaration, without \r\ndistinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, \r\nlanguage, religion, political or other opinion ... or \r\nother status.”  \r\nAfterwards, in 1955, the Convention on Slavery \r\nentered into force. \r\n Years later, in 2001, we adopted the Durban \r\nDeclaration, which stated that  \r\n“slavery and the slave trade, including the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade, were appalling tragedies \r\nin the history of humanity not only because of \r\ntheir abhorrent barbarism but also in terms of \r\ntheir magnitude, organized nature and especially \r\ntheir negation of the essence of the victims, and \r\n[we] further acknowledge that slavery and the \r\nslave trade are a crime against humanity and \r\nshould always have been so, especially the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade and are among the major \r\nsources and manifestations of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance, and that Africans and people of \r\nAfrican descent, Asians and people of Asian \r\ndescent and indigenous peoples were victims of \r\nthese acts and continue to be victims of their \r\nconsequences”. \r\n The adoption of all these instruments was the \r\nfruit of titanic struggles to eradicate imperial \r\ndomination from peoples’ minds and from legal \r\nsystems and to finally recognize that human rights are \r\nfor everyone. \r\n On this commemoration of the abolition of \r\nslavery, we must recognize that the rich countries \r\nestablished the foundations of their economies in the \r\nsweat and lives of millions of African slaves. States \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 12 \r\n \r\nmust not be content with removing slavery from their \r\nlegal systems; we must identify new forms of slavery \r\nand combat them and eradicate them from the planet. \r\nWe must do the same with regard to their \r\nconsequences: neocolonialism, systems of \r\ndiscrimination, economic inequalities and the demands \r\nof multilateral organizations to hand over reserves and \r\nnatural resources as interest payments on an immoral \r\nexternal debt. \r\n In the nineteenth century and even in the \r\ntwentieth century, many laws on the abolition of \r\nslavery provided compensation for slave owners. \r\nToday, States must think of different ways to \r\ncompensate for the cultural, economic and social \r\noutrages committed against African countries. Plans \r\nand coherent strategies are needed for material, moral \r\nand ethical compensation. We cannot limit ourselves to \r\nmonetary reparation, because it is not a question of \r\npaying and forgetting. We must never forget and return \r\nto that infamy. We must ask forgiveness and \r\nconsciously acknowledge the damage done by one part \r\nof humanity. Accepting it by the other part should not \r\nbe a passive acceptance, but active and transformative. \r\nAs the people of Africa say today, they would like to \r\nbe the creators and protagonists of their own political \r\nmodels and of their human and liberating development. \r\n I now call on the representative of Guyana to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/63/L.5. \r\n Mr. Talbot (Guyana): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\ngroup of countries at the United Nations, along with \r\nthe African Group and other Member States sponsoring \r\nthis text, to introduce for adoption today draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.5, entitled “Permanent memorial to \r\nand remembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”. \r\n The draft resolution before us today, which is \r\nessentially procedural in nature, seeks to address \r\ndevelopments that have taken place since the adoption \r\nof resolution 62/122 last December. Two years ago, we \r\nacknowledged in this very Hall that slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade represent one of the low points \r\nin the history of humanity. We recalled the forced \r\nremoval of more than 18 million people, over a period \r\nof 500 years, from Africa to the Americas, including \r\nthe Caribbean, the United States, Brazil and other parts \r\nof Latin America, as well as to Europe. \r\n We recall that 25 March has been designated as \r\nan annual International Day of Remembrance of the \r\nVictims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, \r\nbeginning in 2008. In that context, on behalf of the \r\nStates members of CARICOM, I wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the update provided in his report \r\n(A/63/213) on activities held earlier this year to \r\ncommemorate the anniversary of the abolition of \r\nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade. We look \r\nforward to collaborating with you, Mr. President, the \r\nSecretary-General and the Department of Public \r\nInformation for similar commemorative activities on \r\n25 March 2009.  \r\n The significance of that date is of historic \r\nproportions, since some 200 years ago on that date the \r\nfinal reward was granted to the abolition advocates \r\nwhen their untiring efforts led to the passage in the \r\nBritish Parliament of the act for the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade in the British Empire, and \r\nsubsequently the end of slavery throughout the world. \r\nThe annual remembrance day, linked to the \r\naccomplishment of the abolitionists, will serve as a \r\nvaluable complement to the existing UNESCO \r\nInternational Day for the Remembrance of the Slave \r\nTrade and its Abolition, whose date of 23 August aptly \r\nrecognizes the historically important contribution of \r\nthe slaves of Haiti themselves, who rose up in \r\nresistance to slavery and engineered their own \r\nemancipation. \r\n In 2001, the international community gathered in \r\nSouth Africa for the World Conference Against \r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and \r\nRelated Intolerances, which was held under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations and subsequently issued \r\nwhat is commonly referred to as the Durban \r\nDeclaration. We view the permanent memorial project \r\nin a wider context, as a partial fulfilment of paragraph \r\n101 of the Durban Declaration, which, inter alia, calls \r\nupon the international community to honour the \r\nmemory of the victims of slavery. Consequently, we \r\nhave sought in the third preambular paragraph to \r\nreaffirm the commitment made by States in 2001. \r\n We cannot help but recall the horrific and \r\ndehumanizing nature of slavery and the slave trade, \r\nwhereby the captives were forced into detention and \r\ntransported as human cargo, packed into the foul holds \r\nof ships as mere chattels and taken across the Atlantic \r\nto the so-called New World. They were emasculated, \r\nsold and robbed of their culture, and their skins were \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n13 08-55671 \r\n \r\nbranded by hot irons and imprinted with the label of \r\ntheir owners. Those horrific images still jolt the \r\nconscience, recalling and reinforcing the depths of \r\nman’s inhumanity to man. For that reason, we thought \r\nit fitting to stress in the fourth preambular paragraph \r\nthe importance of educating and informing future \r\ngenerations about the causes, consequences and lessons \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade and slavery. \r\n The permanent memorial will stand as an \r\nacknowledgement of one of the most horrific tragedies \r\nof modern history that is often forgotten. It will stand \r\nas a reminder of the struggle against and triumph over \r\nthe enslavement and dehumanization of a single race \r\nover five centuries for economic gains and the legacy it \r\nhas left behind; hence the theme “acknowledging the \r\ntragedy, considering the legacy, lest we forget”. We \r\nregard the placement of that memorial at the United \r\nNations as a significant symbol of what this \r\nOrganization represents — the promotion and \r\npreservation of the dignity and worth of all human \r\nbeings, which are principles central to the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\n In view of the importance of the permanent \r\nmemorial to humankind and the universal nature of \r\nsuch a monument, we believe that it should be erected \r\nin a place of prominence that would be accessible not \r\nonly to the representatives of this house, but to all who \r\nvisit the United Nations. We have therefore sought to \r\nclarify the language used in the previous resolution, \r\nwhich referred to the halls of the United Nations. \r\nIndeed, it is the widely held view that a place of \r\nprominence at the United Nations, easily accessible to \r\nrepresentatives, United Nations staff and visitors, such \r\nas the plaza at the visitors’ entrance, would be a more \r\nappropriate location for a monument of such great \r\nsignificance. In such a setting, the memorial will truly \r\nbe accessible to all people and all nations. \r\n Through the draft resolution, the Assembly will \r\nendorse the establishment of the committee of \r\ninterested States, referred to in operative paragraph 2, \r\nto oversee the permanent memorial project. The \r\ncommittee is being drawn from all geographical \r\nregions of the United Nations. Importantly, the States \r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community and the African \r\nUnion are playing a primary role in advancing the \r\nwork of the committee and Jamaica has already been \r\nelected to serve as its Chairman. Additionally, the \r\ncommittee, given its inclusive nature, collaborates with \r\nnon-State partners, such as the Secretariat, UNESCO, \r\nthe Schomburg Center and civil society representatives. \r\n Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n A voluntary fund, the Permanent Memorial Fund, \r\nestablished in keeping with resolution 62/122, has been \r\nset up under the custody of the Permanent Mission of \r\nJamaica towards the realization of the memorial. \r\nHowever, in the interest of further transparency and \r\naccountability, it is proposed that the wider committee \r\noversee the Fund. At the same time, the committee is \r\nseeking to explore, with the Secretariat, methods of \r\nensuring enhanced transparency and accountability for \r\nthe management of the Fund in a manner that would be \r\nacceptable to all Member States. \r\n In response to enquiries about the budgetary \r\nimplications arising from the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution, let me say categorically that there are no \r\nsuch implications for the permanent memorial project. \r\nIt is our hope that the permanent memorial will become \r\na reality through the generous contributions given \r\nvoluntarily by Member States, as well as any fund-\r\nraising activities that may be organized by the \r\ncommittee. On behalf of the group of CARICOM \r\nStates, I wish therefore to acknowledge with \r\nappreciation contributions and pledges towards the \r\nFund already received from Member States, while also \r\nencouraging Member States and other interested parties \r\nto join in that important effort. \r\n We would also like to place on record our sincere \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, the Secretariat \r\nand members of the Committee for their invaluable \r\nsupport, technical advice and assistance towards the \r\nimplementation of the permanent memorial project. \r\n Racism, racial discrimination and prejudice \r\ncontinue to cast a destructive stain on societies across \r\nthe globe, and the roots and linkages with the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade and slavery are clearly \r\nestablished; hence, the call to action by States.  \r\n It is in that context that, in paragraph 6, we \r\nreiterate the request contained in resolution 61/19 of \r\n28 November 2006 for Member States that have not \r\nalready done so to develop educational programmes, \r\nincluding through school curricula, designed to educate \r\nand inculcate in future generations an understanding of \r\nthe lessons, history and consequences of slavery and \r\nthe slave trade. \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 14 \r\n \r\n We welcome the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nwhich provides an update on the Secretariat’s activities \r\nto establish, for the first time, an educational outreach \r\nprogramme to mobilize, inter alia, educational \r\ninstitutions and civil society on the subject of \r\ncommemorating the transatlantic slave trade and \r\nslavery. We believe that this will help to address the \r\nignorance and knowledge gap, primarily among young \r\npeople, in understanding the impact and consequences \r\nof slavery and the slave trade. Through the draft \r\nresolution, the General Assembly would request that \r\nthe Secretary-General, in collaboration with and \r\nbuilding upon the work undertaken by UNESCO \r\nthrough the Slave Route Project, continue the outreach \r\nprogramme to inculcate future generations with an \r\nunderstanding of the causes, consequences and lessons \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade and to inform them of \r\nthe dangers of racism and prejudice. \r\n The General Assembly would, by its consensus \r\nadoption of this important draft resolution, recognize \r\nthe continuing impact of slavery and the horrific \r\ntransatlantic slave trade on the African diaspora and its \r\ndescendants, many of whom are in the Assembly Hall \r\ntoday. That has added significance as we prepare to \r\ncelebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights later this year. \r\nIt will engage in a practical and deliberate educational \r\noutreach programme with a view to addressing the \r\ndangers of racism and prejudice that continue to \r\nthreaten the full realization of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. \r\n In conclusion, the CARICOM group of Member \r\nStates sincerely thanks the many sponsors and \r\nsupporters of the current draft resolution and now \r\ninvites the General Assembly to give its unequivocal \r\nsupport to its adoption with a view to bringing to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion the process begun in 2006 in this \r\nour United Nations. \r\n Mr. Muita (Kenya): The African Group is \r\npleased to render its support to the important draft \r\nresolution before us today (A/63/L.5) at a time when \r\nwe are both introducing and taking action on it in the \r\nAssembly. At the outset, we wish to convey our \r\nsincerest appreciation to the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) group of countries for the initiative and \r\nefforts that have allowed all of us to reflect on our past \r\ndeeds, our amazing ability to endure and overcome \r\nimmense adversity, and the collective action that led to \r\nthe demise of the most immoral and dehumanizing \r\naspect of history. \r\n On behalf of the States members of the African \r\nGroup, I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nthe update provided in his report on activities held \r\nearlier this year to commemorate the anniversary of the \r\nabolition of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. \r\nWe look forward to working with the President, the \r\nSecretary-General and the Department of Public \r\nInformation on similar commemorative activities next \r\nyear. \r\n On 25 March 1807, Britain legally abolished the \r\nslave trade and formally brought to a close the most \r\nhorrific experiences man has ever known. That action \r\nwas thereafter separately replicated by other Powers of \r\nthe time. Notwithstanding that seemingly noble action, \r\nslavery was tolerated, condoned and allowed to \r\ncontinue in practice a long time. Man continued to \r\nenslave fellow man, treating him like personal property \r\nand thereby robbing him of all his dignity. The process \r\nof fighting for rights and taking back human dignity \r\nwas characterized by profound risk, danger and \r\nsacrifice. It took collective efforts and great courage to \r\nfight against and defeat slavery. With our discussion on \r\nthis subject, humanity is turning a page on a very \r\npainful past indeed. Useful lessons are discernible from \r\nthose actions, which took place in not so distant a past. \r\nBesides the abolitionists, the unsung heroes are the \r\nslaves themselves. \r\n We face many challenges today. We can draw \r\ninspiration from those who rallied against the slave \r\ntrade and slavery just over two centuries ago. \r\nCollective efforts worked before and we believe that \r\nthey are the surest way to address our challenges. The \r\ndraft resolution is proposing the construction of a \r\npermanent memorial at the United Nations as a \r\npermanent reminder of man’s inhumanity to his fellow \r\nman and as an injunction against such a horrendous \r\ninstitution ever being allowed to manifest itself in our \r\nsociety again. \r\n The permanent memorial dedicated to the victims \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade and slavery can never be \r\nan atonement for the wretched suffering of humankind, \r\nbut is just a token of appreciation to all those heroes \r\nwho stood steadfastly, who pitted their lives against \r\ninjustice, who opposed slavery and fought for freedom, \r\nas well as those who fell victim to cruel and inhuman \r\ntreatment meted out against them by unscrupulous \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n15 08-55671 \r\n \r\nprofiteers, slave masters and unjust societies. The \r\npermanent memorial will serve to remind us of the \r\nheroic actions of the slaves, abolitionists and the \r\nnumerous unheralded men and women of conscience \r\nwho stood up to be counted in the face of grave danger \r\nand adversity. \r\n The permanent memorial will be a memory, a \r\nhistory, a journey through a difficult time, a reminder \r\nof the atrocities of the Middle Passage, the cruel \r\ntransatlantic journey and the seasoning camps. The \r\nmemorial will also be an educational resource and a \r\nstatue of lifelong learning. It will be a reconstruction of \r\nthe past in order to mould the future. It will be a \r\nconstant reminder of the vulnerability of humanity. \r\n The permanent memorial will also be a reminder \r\nof the challenges that we continue to face today. Vices \r\nsuch as racism, xenophobia and discrimination, all akin \r\nto slavery, have begun rearing their ugly heads again. \r\nThere have been incidences of bias, incitement to \r\nhatred and hate crimes in our societies. We are called \r\nupon to firmly stand up to and reject any and all \r\nnotions of supremacy or supremacist ideology. We \r\nhave to guard against the danger of slipping back into \r\nbarbarism. \r\n By adopting the draft resolution, we shall point \r\nout the importance of gaining a better understanding of \r\nthe slave trade and slavery in general. We shall be \r\ncommitting ourselves to ensuring that information \r\nrelating to the slave trade and slavery is available and \r\ndisseminated to all segments of society, particularly \r\nthrough institutions of learning, so that they can join in \r\nthe efforts to promote a cohesive international society \r\nbased on knowledge and understanding of our history. \r\nBy encouraging learning about slavery, we shall reduce \r\nthe danger of making the same mistakes in the future. \r\n The construction of the permanent memorial will \r\nrequire resources and we invite the international \r\ncommunity to join in the endeavour and donate \r\ngenerously so that we may preserve our memory. Those \r\nwould be resources put to good use. I urge us to heed \r\nthe wise words of the Nigerian Nobel Laureate \r\nProfessor Wole Soyinka when he stated that “a people \r\nwho do not preserve their memory are a people who \r\nhave forfeited their history”. Let us give new impetus \r\nto the words “never again”. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the African \r\nGroup’s support for the draft resolution and for the \r\nconstruction of a permanent memorial in honour of all \r\nthe victims of the slave trade, the brave abolitionists \r\nand the collective international efforts that led to the \r\nabolition of the slave trade and slavery. I urge all \r\nMember States to support the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): My delegation wishes to \r\nassociate itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Guyana on behalf of the 14 States \r\nMembers of the Caribbean Community and of Kenya \r\non behalf of the 54 members of the African Group of \r\ncountries. \r\n It is an honour and privilege for me to speak on \r\nagenda item 108, “Follow-up to the commemoration of \r\nthe two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”. It is a well known fact that \r\nmy own region’s history is deeply rooted in the legacy \r\nof slavery, having been colonized first by the Spanish \r\nin the 1500s. Thereafter, most Caribbean countries \r\nremained under British colonial rule for more than 300 \r\nyears. During the colonial period, our region’s ports \r\nwitnessed the arrival of numerous vessels transporting \r\nhundreds of thousands of Africans across the Atlantic \r\nto fortify the labour-intensive market created by the \r\nthen-ruling British plantocracy. \r\n It took the international community almost 200 \r\nyears to acknowledge slavery and the slave trade as \r\ncrimes against humanity. We have been asked why we \r\nbother to rehash an event that happened so long ago. \r\nBut for us, the people of the Caribbean and of Africa, \r\n200 years is really not very long ago. As descendants \r\nof those who lived and died during those 500 years, it \r\nremains our solemn obligation to ensure that their \r\nmemories are honoured and that their suffering is never \r\nforgotten. \r\n It should also be recalled that among the most \r\npernicious legacies of slavery and the slave trade is the \r\nexistence of apartheid and racism, which remained \r\nentrenched in southern Africa until towards the end of \r\nthe twentieth century. Those scourges were uprooted \r\nonly thanks to the indomitable spirit and struggle of the \r\npeoples of the entire African continent to break free \r\nfrom the dehumanization and hardship which they \r\nfaced. \r\n Consequently, it is with a sense of duty and deep \r\nhumility that we seek to honour the memories of our \r\nancestors who were brought to the Caribbean region as \r\na result of the transatlantic slave trade. We firmly \r\nbelieve that the permanent memorial that was \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 16 \r\n \r\nmentioned by the Chair of the Caribbean Community \r\nand endorsed by the General Assembly last year should \r\nbe viewed as a tangible source of hope and a means of \r\nremembrance of the struggles to break free of the \r\nhardships faced under colonial rule. \r\n I take this opportunity to express appreciation to \r\nthe members of the committee that was established to \r\noversee the permanent memorial project and for \r\nelecting Jamaica as Chair and temporary custodian of \r\nthe voluntary fund. We thank the committee for the \r\nconfidence it has bestowed on us and we will strive to \r\nfulfil the objective of executing the project in the most \r\neffective and efficient manner. I make this point to \r\nhighlight the fact that, with the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution before us today, we seek to broaden the \r\nlatter responsibility so that the committee will oversee \r\nthe fund while it seeks to explore with the Secretariat \r\nmethods of ensuring enhanced transparency and \r\naccountability for its operation in a manner that would \r\nbe acceptable to all Member States. \r\n With members’ indulgence, I also wish to express \r\nsincere appreciation for the kind generosity of the \r\nGovernments of those countries that have already made \r\ndonations to the Permanent Memorial Fund. We are \r\nthankful for the show of solidarity in acknowledging \r\nthe legacy of this dark period of history. In that regard, \r\nI wish to publicly thank the following countries: \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Belize, \r\nBotswana, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Haiti, Luxembourg, \r\nMozambique, Namibia, Portugal, Qatar, Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, \r\nSyria, Turkey and, of course, my own country, \r\nJamaica. We envisage that other countries will follow \r\nin their footsteps in making contributions to the \r\nPermanent Fund. \r\n In closing, I would also like to make special \r\nmention of those countries from which we have so far \r\nreceived pledges: Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain \r\nand, of course, the United Kingdom. \r\n Finally, I took forward to collaborating with the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Department of Public Information and \r\nother Member States in the preparatory activities to \r\nmark the annual commemorative event on 25 March in \r\nhonour of the anniversary of the abolition of slavery \r\nand the slave trade. \r\n Mrs. Núñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The transatlantic African slave trade was one \r\nof the greatest tragedies in the history of humankind \r\nand the most serious violation of human rights ever \r\ncommitted in terms of its scale and duration. Between \r\n1450 and 1850, some 12 million African men, women \r\nand children were torn from their homes, sold as slaves \r\nand forced to cross the Atlantic Ocean from their \r\ncountries of origin to the American continent. Many \r\nmillions more perished en route. For each slave \r\ntransported and sold, three died. More than 60,000 \r\nvoyages were necessary. Considered by many as the \r\nlargest human deportation in history, the transatlantic \r\nslave trade had an irreversible effect on the enslaved \r\nAfrican population because, with the exception of \r\nsome small groups, millions of Africans were never \r\nable to return to their country of origin. \r\n However, the crime of imposed deportation was \r\nnot enough. The slave trade was accompanied by \r\nstrong racist ideology. Black people were classified as \r\ninferior beings, frequently as animals. They were \r\nconsidered to have no rights under the law and were \r\ntherefore treated legally as objects.  \r\n In Cuba, deep traces of that sordid chapter \r\nremain. During the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth \r\nand nineteenth centuries, approximately 1.3 million \r\nAfricans were forcibly transported to Cuba to be \r\nenslaved on plantations and in services of various \r\ntypes. During the colonial period in our country, \r\nAfricans and their descendants alike suffered the \r\nravages of racism, discrimination, a total lack of rights \r\nand marginalization even after slavery was prohibited \r\nin the second half of the 1880s. Unfortunately, Cuba \r\nwas not the only country in the American continent that \r\nwas a victim of the transatlantic slave trade. Stories \r\nsimilar to Cuba’s were re-enacted throughout nearly \r\nthe entire American continent and the Antilles. \r\n The so-called triangular slave trade was part and \r\nparcel of the bloody exploitation and impoverishment \r\nof the African continent and the cruel discrimination \r\nthat African descendents in the western hemisphere \r\nsuffered for years. The inhuman business of the slave \r\ntrade was profitable only for the colonial metropoles \r\nthat started, developed and maintained it over \r\ncenturies. It had disastrous consequences for the \r\neconomic development of the only affected areas, in \r\nparticular in the African continent, which was plunged \r\ninto several centuries of economic backwardness and \r\npolitical disorder that continued with the formal \r\ncolonization of the so-called scramble for Africa of the \r\nnineteenth century. \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n17 08-55671 \r\n \r\n Paradoxically, nowadays many purport to be \r\nunaware of, justify or, worse still, erase that sad \r\nchapter from our history. The opposition of the former \r\ncolonial metropolises to any formula aimed at \r\nhonouring an historical debt to those who endured \r\nslavery over centuries has become entrenched.  \r\n Those who amassed huge fortunes at the expense \r\nof the slaves’ sweat and blood, and plunged our nations \r\ninto the disastrous consequences of monoproduction \r\nand monocrop economies cannot wash their hands now \r\nof their dark past by means of a self-induced historical \r\namnesia in the midst of a neoliberal globalization \r\nwhereby the rich — the very same as those of times \r\npast — have grown ever richer and our nations have \r\nbeen reduced to exclusion and impoverishment. \r\n Cuba attaches great importance to the United \r\nNations endeavours to combat racism and xenophobia, \r\nand particularly the actions agreed at the World \r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, \r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance held in Durban, \r\nSouth Africa, in August and September 2001, to focus \r\ndue attention on the needs of the victims of slavery, the \r\nslave trade, servitude imposed on indigenous peoples \r\nand colonialism, as well as their descendants. \r\n Despite being subject to a tight economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed by the \r\nUnited States Government for more than four decades, \r\nCuba has developed and will continue to develop \r\ncooperation programmes with African, Caribbean and \r\nother third world sister nations as part of a joint effort \r\nto reverse the consequences of the slave trade and other \r\nsad moments of colonialism and neocolonialism. \r\n We will continue to insist that slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade be declared crimes against \r\nhumanity and that the descendants of the victims of \r\nthose criminal practices, colonialism and the genocidal \r\nexploitation of indigenous peoples be given the \r\nreparations and compensation they deserve as an \r\noutstanding measure of historical justice. \r\n The commemoration of the two-hundredth \r\nanniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade is also an opportunity to remember contemporary \r\nforms of slavery: trafficking in persons, forced \r\nprostitution, forced labour in slave conditions and the \r\nuse of children in international drug trafficking. Those \r\nforms continue to flourish today, mostly as the result of \r\ndiscrimination, social exclusion and vulnerability, \r\nwhich are all exacerbated by poverty. The international \r\ncommunity must be aware of that fact. Their \r\neradication is a goal for all of us. \r\n Mr. Chabar (Morocco) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, and as this is the first time I take the floor in the \r\nplenary, allow me to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his accession to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session and on the \r\ninitiatives he has undertaken to mobilize Member \r\nStates to confront the challenges of today. His wisdom \r\nand his erudition will be precious assets in uniting and \r\nbringing together the international community on its \r\npath towards a safer, fairer and more human world. He \r\nmay rest assured of our delegation’s support. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Kenya on \r\nbehalf of the African Group, and wishes to add the \r\nfollowing comments. \r\n Today, commemoration and remembrance \r\ncombine as the General Assembly prepares to adopt a \r\nbeacon draft resolution at the initiative of the States \r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\non the creation of a permanent memorial to the victims \r\nof slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco welcomes that \r\ndecision, whereby the international community speaks \r\nin one voice against collective amnesia regarding one \r\nof the most sinister episodes of human history during \r\nwhich, over four centuries, millions of Africans were \r\ndeported to the new world and reduced to slavery, a \r\nlucrative trade that contributed to the development of \r\nthe Americas and Europe. According to estimates, the \r\ndifferent phases of the transatlantic slave trade \r\ndeprived 25 to 30 million individuals of their freedom, \r\nwithout counting the 17 million who died on ships \r\nplying the Atlantic Ocean.  \r\n On this solemn occasion, we remember with \r\nemotion the tenacious struggle of abolitionists whose \r\nnames remain indelibly etched in the stone of the \r\npantheon of history: Toussaint Louverture, Frederick \r\nDouglass, William Wilberforce, Harriet Tubman and \r\nVictor Schoelcher. \r\n The creation of a permanent memorial to the \r\nvictims of slavery will offer States Members and staff \r\nof and visitors to the United Nations a place and a \r\nsymbol that invites them to reflect on the historical \r\nroots, the modus operandi and the consequences of the \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 18 \r\n \r\ninexcusable tragedy of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. \r\n Beyond the duty of remembrance, it is \r\nfundamental to raise awareness of the upheavals that \r\nthe trade of souls brought upon the various people \r\nconcerned. The slave trade, as a large-scale forced \r\nmigration, also led to cultural exchanges that deeply \r\nmarked habits, beliefs, social relations and knowledge \r\non several continents.  \r\n The cultural footprint of the victims of slavery \r\nand the slave trade connects fields as varied as \r\nknowledge and the arts, oral patrimony, musical \r\ngenres, philosophy and literature. Slaves were \r\nnecessarily the vectors of a civilizational legacy that \r\nresulted in the fusion of cultures from Europe, Africa, \r\nthe Indian Ocean, the Caribbean and the Americas. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco, by commemorating \r\n“the greatest tragedy of human history in scale and \r\nduration”, in the words of the French historian Jean-\r\nMichel Deveau, wishes to readdress the intellectual \r\nlegitimization of slavery and its ideological basis in the \r\ndoctrinal formulation of anti-black identity and its \r\nlegal organization through the Code Noir of 1685. \r\n The international community has a sacred duty to \r\ndeconstruct racial prejudice and to fight ideologies of \r\nhatred of the other and intolerance. Of course, those \r\nobjectives involve the promotion of dialogue between \r\ncultures, religions and, more broadly speaking, \r\ncivilizations. Thus, Morocco participates actively in a \r\nnumber of initiatives, including the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, and untiringly works to promote \r\ninternally and internationally such values as tolerance, \r\ndialogue and respect for others. \r\n Such values are not accidental; they are the result \r\nof the millennial history of Morocco, which embodies \r\noverlapping and enmeshing African, Arab, European \r\nand Andalusian identities. \r\n We invite all States to contribute to the financing \r\nof the memorial, which we wish to see serve as a \r\npermanent testimony to our rejection of the \r\nexploitation of the other, racism and historical amnesia. \r\nAs an African State, the Kingdom of Morocco calls for \r\na tightening of the bonds between Africa and its \r\ndiaspora and for the promotion of a relaxation of \r\ntensions and reconciliation with others, through an \r\nobjective and uncompromising reflection on the impact \r\nof this tragedy on Africans and their transatlantic \r\ndescendants. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nKenya on behalf of the African Group in support of \r\ndraft resolution A/63/L.5, which is before the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Ghana attaches great importance to this draft \r\nresolution and is pleased to be a part of this initiative \r\nwhich acknowledges one of the worst violations of \r\nhuman rights in the history of humanity: the \r\nenslavement and dehumanization of people of African \r\ndescent over hundreds of years. \r\n We express our appreciation to the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) for leading the initiative to \r\nerect in a place of prominence in the corridors of the \r\nUnited Nations a permanent memorial in honour of \r\nthose sons and daughters of Africa who perished in the \r\nMiddle Passage, in resistance to slavery or as a result \r\nof the indignities and alienation they suffered in the \r\nNew World. In this regard, we once again pledge our \r\nsupport for the establishment of a permanent memorial \r\nfund to bring the project to fruition. \r\n The memorial will make a significant \r\ncontribution towards our global efforts to carry out the \r\naction plan adopted in 2001 at the Durban Anti-Racism \r\nConference aimed at eradicating the scourge of racism, \r\nxenophobia and discrimination. Indeed, the placement \r\nof this monument at the United Nations will reaffirm \r\nand attest to what our noble Organization stands for: \r\nthe promotion, protection and preservation of the \r\ndignity and worth of all peoples. \r\n We should all follow up to ensure that the \r\nnecessary resources for effective fulfilment of this \r\nproject are made available through our generous \r\ncontributions so that the preparations may proceed as \r\nplanned. \r\n In conclusion, Ghana wishes to reiterate its \r\nsupport for this important draft resolution. \r\n Mr. McMahan (United States of America): This \r\ndebate is indeed a fitting reminder of a despicable \r\npractice that devalued human life and dignity. After a \r\ncivil war that sought to reconcile the words and \r\nconcepts that gave birth to our republic with a brutal \r\nreality of a largely agrarian society fuelled by the \r\nblood and sweat of human bondage, the thirteenth \r\namendment to the United States Constitution was \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n19 08-55671 \r\n \r\nadopted on 6 December 1865, officially abolishing \r\nslavery in the United States of America.  \r\n While the transatlantic slave trade ended \r\ncenturies ago, a contemporary form of slavery thrives \r\ntoday under a different name: trafficking in persons, or \r\nhuman trafficking. Like the early slave traders, today’s \r\ntraffickers use many of the same tools: kidnapping, \r\nfraud, threats and beatings, all aimed, just as in earlier \r\ncenturies, at forcing men, women and children into \r\nlabour and sexual exploitation.  \r\n Trafficking is a crime that respects no borders. \r\nEach year, an estimated 800,000 men, women and \r\nchildren are trafficked across international borders, and \r\nmillions of others are trafficked within their own \r\ncountries. And in virtually every country around the \r\nworld, including the United States, men, women and \r\nchildren are held in domestic servitude, forcibly \r\nexploited for commercial sex and coerced to work in \r\nfactories and sweatshops. In some countries, children \r\nare forcibly recruited as soldiers. These forms of \r\nhuman trafficking are in fact modern-day slavery. \r\n The United States has taken a broad range of \r\nactions to halt these practices, because we strongly \r\nbelieve it is the right thing to do. We remain committed \r\nto recognizing the abolition of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade, commemorating its victims and reversing its \r\nharms. We are proud to be in a position to co-sponsor \r\nthe draft General Assembly resolution regarding a \r\npermanent memorial to the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade, which we are about to adopt. \r\n Mr. Rogachev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): At the outset, allow me to extend the Russian \r\nFederation’s gratitude to the delegations of the \r\ncountries of the Caribbean Basin for their draft \r\nresolution entitled, “Permanent memorial to and \r\nremembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade” (A/63/L.5), which the \r\nRussian Federation co-sponsors. We consider the \r\nattention devoted to this problem by the United \r\nNations to be entirely justified.  \r\n As is well known, our Organization was born in \r\nresponse to the horrors that afflicted the world during \r\nthe years of the Second World War. And even though \r\nthat war and the transatlantic slave trade were \r\nseparated by 150 years, the underlying causes of those \r\ntwo historic events are very similar. Here we are \r\nreferring to a perverted concept that claims that one \r\ngroup is allegedly superior to another. It seems \r\nespecially important to us that the draft resolution \r\ninclude provisions regarding the raising of awareness \r\nabout the causes and consequences of the slave trade \r\nand the lessons to be drawn from its legacy. We are \r\nconvinced that the current generation and those to \r\ncome should not forget about this tragic chapter of \r\nhumankind’s history. \r\n It is not often that the United Nations addresses \r\nhistorical wrongs. Indeed, Member States focus first \r\nand foremost on the most pressing and current \r\nproblems. Here, however, we have an example of a \r\ncase where a historical event is of a global scale; where \r\nits effects can be seen on the course of humankind’s \r\nhistory and it will continue to have a clear impact on \r\nour present and future. \r\n Ms. Bethel (Bahamas): I would like first of all to \r\nalign myself with the statement made by Guyana on \r\nbehalf of the Caribbean Community and Common \r\nMarket (CARICOM) member States. It was just about \r\ntwo years ago that the CARICOM member States, with \r\nthe proud co-sponsorship of numerous countries, \r\nincluding those from our ancestral home Africa, \r\nushered through the General Assembly the resolution \r\nthat established the basis for the commemoration of the \r\ntwo-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade. The adoption of that \r\nresolution was indeed historic and, as was noted at the \r\ntime, its mission would be to erect a bridge spanning \r\ntwo hundred years across the seas and lands of Africa, \r\nEurope, the Americas and the Caribbean. \r\n The legacy of the slave trade highlights, among \r\nother things, the capacity in all of us to take principled \r\naction, to speak out against injustice and to conquer \r\nvictimization by living, surviving, advancing and \r\nforgiving, even in the face of seemingly \r\ninsurmountable odds. Looking at the lives of the \r\npeople enslaved for centuries in the Americas and the \r\nCaribbean teaches us much about the capacity of \r\nhuman beings to strive and be hopeful, even under the \r\nmost dehumanizing conditions. The triumph over \r\nslavery is a testimony to the human spirit, which can \r\nemerge from the harshest victimization, exploitation \r\nand oppression, with remarkable joy, creativity and \r\ninventiveness. \r\n The indelible etchings of Africa on every aspect \r\nof our life in the Caribbean are the bedrock of our \r\nsustenance as a people and will always be the source of \r\nour creativity and perseverance. On the stage of \r\nA/63/PV.29  \r\n \r\n08-55671 20 \r\n \r\nhistory, ours has not always been a joyful and \r\ntriumphant lot, and yet we participate here today in this \r\nworld body with utmost pride and determination, the \r\nsame pride and dogged determination that served to \r\nensure the survival of our forebears even under the \r\nmost cruel and dire of circumstances. The depths of \r\ntheir humanity, the unyielding core of their spiritual \r\nhome, have become the wellspring of our undying \r\nvision of a peaceful world that is at once hopeful, \r\ndiverse, tolerant and forward looking — essential \r\nelements that must underpin the future in order to \r\nensure the survival of humankind. \r\n Last year, in order to help inculcate in future \r\ngenerations knowledge about the causes, consequences \r\nand lessons of slavery, as well as to inform of the \r\ndangers of racism and prejudice, the sixty-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly adopted resolution \r\n62/122, designating 25 March as an annual \r\nInternational Day of Remembrance of the Victims of \r\nSlavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Our \r\nwatchword must forever be, lest we forget. \r\n For the same compelling reasons, the Bahamas is \r\ngreatly heartened by the progress made in the ongoing \r\ncampaign to establish a permanent memorial here at \r\nthe United Nations to the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade, in acknowledgement of that \r\ntragedy and in consideration of its legacy. As a sponsor \r\nof draft resolution A/63/L.5, we wish to express our \r\nappreciation to the Permanent Mission of Jamaica for \r\nthe pivotal role it has played in moving the process \r\nforward, to reiterate our sincere appreciation to all \r\nthose who have contributed to that undertaking and to \r\nexpress our hope that many more will support that \r\nnoble and worthy project. I am pleased to report that \r\nthe Government of the Bahamas has made a pledge to \r\nthe fund that will be forthcoming in short order. \r\n Mr. Vishvjit P. Singh (India): I am pleased to \r\nparticipate in the general discussion on the agenda item \r\nentitled “Follow-up to the commemoration of the two-\r\nhundredth anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”. I thank the Member States of \r\nthe Caribbean region for bringing that important item \r\non to the agenda of the General Assembly. I firmly \r\nsupport the statement made by the representative of \r\nGuyana on behalf of the Caribbean States. \r\n Former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru \r\ncalled slavery and the transatlantic slave trade an \r\ninfinite tragedy. In the Swahili language, it is \r\nsometimes referred to as Maafa, meaning holocaust or \r\ngreat disaster. It is often overlooked that the tragic \r\ncrime of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery \r\nextended over more than five centuries. Scholars have \r\nestimated that during that period the Atlantic slave \r\ntrade led to the loss of at least 50 million potential \r\nAfrican lives. Had that not happened, Africa’s \r\npopulation in 1850 would have been 100 million \r\ninstead of 50 million. The horror of the Middle Passage \r\nis unique; during which, without food and basic \r\namenities, at least one sixth of those transported died \r\nin loneliness, darkness and trauma. \r\n India shares the pain and suffering of the affected \r\ncountries. We remember our own tragedy of \r\ncolonialism and the export of indentured labour. The \r\nracism that was an inevitable dimension of slavery \r\nbecame part of the rationale for colonialism. There was \r\na boomerang effect. Nazism was simply that racism \r\napplied within Europe. As the great Caribbean poet \r\nCésaire said, the poison was slowly distilled into the \r\nveins of Europe, and Nazism, before engulfing the \r\nwhole edifice of Western civilization in its reddened \r\nwaters, had oozed and trickled from every crack. \r\n We welcome the resolution adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly two years ago on the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade and the General Assembly’s \r\ndecision to commemorate that in the United Nations by \r\nconvening a special meeting of the General Assembly \r\non 26 March 2007. I would also like to welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/63/213) on the \r\nprogramme of educational outreach on the transatlantic \r\nslave trade and slavery. \r\n We are honoured to co-sponsor this year’s draft \r\nresolution entitled “Permanent memorial to and \r\nremembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”. A permanent memorial will \r\nsymbolize that colossal tragedy and remain before our \r\neyes as a permanent remembrance to stir us to thought \r\nand action. We join the Caribbean Community \r\ncountries in requesting that Member States contribute \r\nto that memorial and adopt that draft resolution. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Before proceeding to take action on draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.5, I should like to announce that, \r\nsince the introduction of the draft resolution, the \r\n A/63/PV.29\r\n \r\n21 08-55671 \r\n \r\nfollowing countries have become co-sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution: Belgium, Bolivia, Bulgaria, China, \r\nColombia, Croatia, Fiji, Finland, France, Greece, \r\nHonduras, Iraq, Japan, Lichtenstein, the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, Monaco, New Zealand, Papua \r\nNew Guinea, the Russian Federation, Samoa, Serbia, \r\nSlovenia, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Turkey, the United States of America and \r\nUruguay. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n I now call on the representative of Cape Verde on \r\na point of order. \r\n Mr. Lima (Cape Verde) (spoke in French): The \r\ndraft resolution that we are about to adopt is an \r\nimportant draft resolution, as we have seen from the \r\nstatements of the various representatives who took the \r\nfloor on this issue.  \r\n Personally, I cannot understand that all Africa can \r\nbe represented only by this month’s Chairman of our \r\nGroup. I request that all the States of Africa be listed as \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution, and not only be \r\nrepresented by the Chairman of the African Group. I do \r\nnot understand the decision that has led to this draft \r\nresolution, which is of fundamental importance to all \r\nAfrica, being limited to being sponsored only by this \r\nmonth’s Chairman of the African Group.  \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly takes note \r\nof the clarification made by the representative of Cape \r\nVerde. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n The Assembly will now take action on draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.5, entitled “Permanent memorial to \r\nand remembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”. May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/63/L.5? \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.5 was adopted (resolution \r\n63/5) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 108? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The President in the Chair \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): May I inform \r\nmembers that consideration of agenda item 41 entitled \r\n“Implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on \r\nHIV/AIDS and the Political Declaration on \r\nHIV/AIDS”, scheduled for Monday, 3 November 2008, \r\nhas been deferred to a subsequent date that will be \r\nannounced in due course. May I also bring to the \r\nattention of members that document A/INF/63/4/Rev.1 \r\nhas been published. It contains a revised version of the \r\nGeneral Assembly programme of work and the \r\nschedule for plenary meetings for the period from \r\n22 October to December 2008. \r\n I should also like to remind members that the lists \r\nof speakers for items listed in document \r\nA/INF/63/4/Rev.1 are open. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.45 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
