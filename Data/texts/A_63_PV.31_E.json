(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 80 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/276) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/63/L.6) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now invite \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, to introduce the \r\nreport of the Agency for 2007, which has been \r\ntransmitted to the General Assembly by the note by the \r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/63/276. \r\n Mr. ElBaradei (International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency): We meet at a time of heightened anxiety and \r\ninsecurity in the world. The global financial crisis is \r\nhitting rich and poor countries alike, but the poorest of \r\nthe poor — the so-called bottom billion — are \r\nparticularly vulnerable. Concern about the proliferation \r\nof nuclear weapons and the possibility of extremist \r\ngroups getting hold of nuclear or radioactive material \r\nhas not diminished in the 12 months since I last spoke \r\nto the General Assembly.  \r\n The work of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) is at the nexus of development and \r\nsecurity. In that context, I will give the Assembly an \r\nupdate on the Agency’s work over the past year and \r\nhighlight some of the challenges that need to be \r\naddressed. \r\n The Agency’s work in technical cooperation is \r\nsometimes seen — wrongly — as an adjunct to our real \r\nwork in nuclear safety, security and non-proliferation. \r\nThat is unfortunate. Technical cooperation should not \r\nbe seen as part of a political balance between the \r\ndevelopment and other activities of the Agency. Our \r\nrole as a development agency is as important as \r\nanything else we do. To that end, we have established \r\neffective partnerships with agencies such as the World \r\nHealth Organization and the Food and Agricultural \r\nOrganization of the United Nations. Thanks to those \r\npartnerships, many thousands of people receive \r\nradiation therapy for cancer, grow higher-yielding food \r\ncrops and have access to clean drinking water. \r\n In the past year, the surge in global food prices \r\nhas pushed millions of people deeper into poverty and \r\nhunger. That clearly increases the importance of the \r\nwork done by the IAEA to boost food supplies and \r\ncombat pests and animal diseases. In some areas, the \r\nIAEA role is unique. For example, the best technology \r\nfor mapping water resources cannot be deployed \r\nwithout the IAEA because it involves nuclear \r\ntechniques. \r\n A recent World Bank report showed that some \r\n1.4 billion people in the developing world live on less \r\nthan $1.25 per day. The number of poor people in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa has nearly doubled since 1981 to \r\naround 380 million. The international community has a \r\nresponsibility to ensure that those people and others \r\nlike them are not cut off from technologies that will \r\naccelerate economic development and help to ensure \r\nthat their basic needs are met. \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 2 \r\n \r\n Energy is the engine of development. Nearly \r\nevery aspect of development requires reliable access to \r\nmodern energy services. The global energy imbalance \r\nremains dramatic. The developed countries that make \r\nup the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment consume electricity on average at a per \r\ncapita rate of 8,600 kilowatt-hours per year — roughly \r\n170 times more than is consumed in Africa. It is \r\nunderstandable that many developing countries, \r\ntherefore, should see nuclear power as a key source of \r\nthe energy they need to lift their people out of poverty. \r\n Nuclear power is undergoing something of a \r\nrenaissance. That is a remarkable development. Just 10 \r\nyears ago, nuclear power had stopped growing in the \r\ndeveloped countries and its future globally looked \r\nuncertain as fears about safety were predominant. Now \r\nit is seen as offering part of the solution to surging \r\nglobal demand for energy, uncertainty about energy \r\nsupply and concern about climate change. In the past \r\ntwo years, some 50 Member States have expressed \r\ninterest in considering the possible introduction of \r\nnuclear power and asked for Agency support. Twelve \r\nof those countries are actively preparing to introduce \r\nnuclear power. Increased demand for assistance has \r\nbeen particularly strong from developing countries. \r\n There are now 439 nuclear power reactors \r\noperating in 30 countries and the number of new plants \r\nunder construction stands at 36. The IAEA advises \r\ncountries considering the introduction of nuclear \r\npower, helping them to identify their options and the \r\nbest energy mix for them. To ensure that newcomers \r\nuse nuclear energy efficiently, safely, securely and with \r\nminimal proliferation risk, we impress upon them the \r\nneed to plan properly, to build the human resources and \r\ninfrastructure, to establish independent and effective \r\nregulators and to adhere to international safety, security \r\nand non-proliferation instruments. We offer advice in \r\ndrafting national nuclear legislation and we train \r\nregulators and operators. \r\n Above all, we stress that the primary \r\nresponsibility to ensure safety and security lies with \r\nthe countries concerned. However, we also make the \r\ncompanies and countries that supply the equipment and \r\nexpertise aware of their responsibility. That is because \r\nfailures of either safety or security can have \r\nconsequences stretching well beyond national borders, \r\nas the Chernobyl accident demonstrated. Recipients \r\nand suppliers alike of nuclear technology owe a duty of \r\ncare to the world at large. \r\n Overall, safety is much better than it was 10 years \r\nago, but vulnerabilities remain. We can never be \r\ncomplacent about safety. A single nuclear accident \r\nanywhere in the world could undermine the future of \r\nnuclear energy everywhere, so it is in all our interests \r\nto ensure that the highest safety standards be upheld \r\neverywhere. \r\n One implication of a nuclear renaissance is the \r\nspread of nuclear material to many more countries. That \r\nnaturally increases the risk that nuclear material could \r\nbe diverted to make nuclear weapons. It is worth noting \r\nthat countries that master uranium enrichment and \r\nplutonium separation become de facto nuclear-weapons-\r\ncapable States. That means they have the ability to \r\ndevelop nuclear weapons in a very short time if they \r\nwalked out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), or managed to do so in a \r\nclandestine manner. That is clearly too narrow a margin \r\nof security. Those countries may genuinely have no \r\nintention today of ever making nuclear weapons, but \r\nthat can change in a short time if their perception of the \r\nrisks to their national security changes. And as we \r\nknow, security perceptions can change very rapidly. \r\n That is why we need to think seriously about \r\nsome form of multinational control over the fuel cycle. \r\nIt should provide assurance that every country that \r\nwants nuclear energy and is in compliance with its \r\nsafeguards obligations has guaranteed access to a \r\nsupply of nuclear fuel that will not be interrupted for \r\npolitical reasons. I first made that proposal five years \r\nago. Several ideas have been put forward since then on \r\ndeveloping a new, multilateral framework for the \r\nnuclear fuel cycle. That could be done, obviously, in \r\ndifferent ways, but, I believe that any such framework \r\nmust be global and non-discriminatory. \r\n The ideal scenario, in my opinion, would be to \r\nstart with a nuclear fuel bank under IAEA auspices. \r\nThen we should agree that all new enrichment and \r\nreprocessing activities should be placed exclusively \r\nunder multilateral control. Ultimately, all existing \r\nfacilities should also be converted from national to \r\nmultilateral control. That is a bold agenda and it is \r\nclearly not going to happen overnight, but bold \r\nmeasures, including controlling the spread of sensitive \r\nnuclear technology, are vital if we are ever going to \r\nhalt the proliferation of nuclear weapons and succeed \r\nin eliminating them altogether. However, make no \r\nmistake — any mechanism that smacks of inequality or \r\ndependency will never get off the ground. \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n3 08-56886 \r\n \r\n The possibility of terrorists obtaining nuclear or \r\nother radioactive material remains a grave threat. The \r\nnumber of incidents reported to the Agency involving \r\nthe theft or loss of nuclear or radioactive material is \r\ndisturbingly high — nearly 250 in the year to June \r\n2008 alone. Equally troubling is the fact that much of \r\nthat material is not subsequently recovered. Sometimes \r\nmaterial is found which had not been reported missing. \r\nThe Agency helps countries improve their border \r\ncontrols, strengthen the physical protection of nuclear \r\nmaterial and radioactive sources, and enhance nuclear \r\nsecurity at major public events, such as the Beijing \r\nOlympic Games this summer. \r\n Effective nuclear verification requires four \r\nessential elements: adequate legal authority, state-of-\r\nthe-art technology, timely access to all relevant \r\ninformation, and sufficient human and financial \r\nresources. Despite some progress, we still have \r\nshortcomings in all four areas. With respect to legal \r\nauthority, it has been over 10 years since the Model \r\nAdditional Protocol was approved by the IAEA Board \r\nof Governors. Of the 163 States with safeguards \r\nagreements, only 88 now have additional protocols in \r\nforce — not much more than half. \r\n It is also disconcerting that 30 States party to the \r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty have not even \r\nbrought into force their required comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements with the Agency. As I have said \r\nrepeatedly, without safeguards agreements, the Agency \r\ncannot provide any assurance about a State’s nuclear \r\nactivities, and without additional protocols we cannot \r\nprovide credible assurances regarding the absence of \r\nundeclared nuclear material and activities. \r\n Concerning the technological aspect of our work, \r\nto take just one example, we remain uncomfortably \r\ndependent in our verification work on satellite imagery \r\nand environmental sampling analysis provided by \r\nMember States. We clearly need a minimum \r\nindependent capability to ensure our credibility. \r\n Earlier this month, the authorities of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea briefly \r\nwithheld access to the Yongbyon nuclear facilities from \r\nour inspectors, who had been monitoring and verifying \r\nthe shutdown of the facilities. Access was subsequently \r\nrestored following an agreement between the United \r\nStates and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\non a verification protocol. I naturally still hope that \r\nconditions can be created for the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to return to the NPT soon and for \r\nthe resumption by the Agency of comprehensive \r\nsafeguards. \r\n Mr. Salgueiro (Portugal), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Six years have elapsed since the Agency began \r\nworking to clarify Iran’s nuclear programme. \r\nSubstantial progress has been made under a workplan \r\nagreed with Iran to clarify outstanding issues, \r\nincluding, importantly, the nature of Iran’s enrichment \r\nactivities. The Agency has been able to continue to \r\nverify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in \r\nIran. \r\n However, I regret that we are still not in a \r\nposition to achieve full clarity regarding the absence of \r\nundeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. That \r\nis because the Agency has not been able to make \r\nsubstantive progress on the alleged studies and \r\nassociated questions relevant to possible military \r\ndimensions to Iran’s nuclear programme. \r\n I reiterate that the Agency does not in any way \r\nseek to pry into Iran’s conventional or missile-related \r\nmilitary activities. Our focus is clearly on nuclear \r\nmaterial and activities. I am confident that \r\narrangements can be developed which will enable the \r\nAgency to clarify the remaining issues while ensuring \r\nthat Iran’s legitimate right to protect the confidentiality \r\nof sensitive information and activities is respected. I \r\ntherefore urge Iran to implement all the transparency \r\nmeasures required to build confidence in the \r\nexclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme at \r\nan early date. That will be good for Iran, good for the \r\nMiddle East region and good for the world. \r\n I have often expressed concern that the Agency \r\nlacks sufficient legal authority and adequate resources \r\nto do its job properly. Last year, I appointed an \r\nindependent Commission of Eminent Persons to \r\nexamine our work and make recommendations for the \r\nfuture of the Agency up to 2020 and beyond. The \r\nCommission, chaired by the former President of \r\nMexico, Ernesto Zedillo, produced its report earlier \r\nthis year. Its recommendations make compelling \r\nreading. I will highlight a few of them. \r\n First, the Commission says that the Agency, \r\nworking with supplier and donor States, should help \r\n“newcomer” States to put in place the necessary \r\ninfrastructure to launch nuclear energy programmes \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 4 \r\n \r\nsafely, securely and peacefully. The Agency should \r\nalso give high priority to establishing multilateral fuel \r\ncycle arrangements, covering everything from \r\nassurance of supply of nuclear fuel to waste disposal. \r\n Secondly, the Commission says our Technical \r\nCooperation Programme, focusing on using nuclear \r\napplications in food and agriculture, human health and \r\nnatural resources, needs to be significantly expanded. \r\nTechnical cooperation funds continue to lag well \r\nbehind the pressing needs of developing countries. \r\n Thirdly, in order to help address the threat of \r\nnuclear terrorism, the Commission urges Member \r\nStates to negotiate binding agreements — not \r\nvoluntary, as at present — to set effective global \r\nnuclear security standards and to give the Agency the \r\nresources and authority to help ensure they are \r\nimplemented. \r\n Fourthly, the Commission proposes that the \r\nAgency should lead an international effort to establish \r\na global nuclear safety network, also based on binding \r\nagreements. Countries should submit to mandatory \r\ninternational nuclear safety peer reviews. \r\n Fifthly, the Agency’s safeguards activities should \r\nbe strengthened. That means better tools, more human \r\nand financial resources, as well as more legal authority. \r\nOn safeguards, I should note that nuclear disarmament, \r\nthe core of the NPT, has been on the back burner for \r\nfar too long. As the Commission says, “States must \r\nrecommit to the vision of a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons”. The Commission notes that, naturally, the \r\nIAEA is not the lead agency for nuclear disarmament, \r\nbut it rightly points out that “progress towards \r\ndisarmament, or the lack of it, deeply affects the \r\nIAEA’s non-proliferation mission”. \r\n The sums of money proposed by the Commission \r\nof Eminent Persons for measures to enhance the \r\nAgency’s effectiveness are very modest. But this is not \r\njust about money. The Agency does not work in a \r\nvacuum. Political commitment to the goals of the \r\nAgency needs to be renewed at the highest level to \r\nencourage the transfer of nuclear technology to the \r\ndeveloping world, to enhance safety and security, to \r\nstrengthen non-proliferation and, naturally, to \r\naccelerate the process of nuclear disarmament. \r\n Furthermore, the problems facing the world in the \r\nnuclear arena are plain for all of us to see. The Agency \r\ncan do much to address them if given the authority, \r\ntechnology and resources. Much more than the future \r\nof the Agency is at stake. We are talking about \r\ninternational development and security, and ultimately \r\nabout the sort of world we want to leave to our \r\nchildren. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.6. \r\n Mr. Benmihidi (Algeria): Allow me at the outset \r\nto welcome Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nand to extend to him, on behalf of the Algerian \r\ndelegation, our sincere thanks for the introduction of \r\nthe annual report of the work of the Agency for 2007 \r\nand for the valuable information he provided on the \r\nactivities of the Agency during the period covered. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to commend \r\nthe work of Mr. ElBaradei at the head of the Agency \r\nand to pay tribute to the tireless efforts he has deployed \r\nduring his mandate and to the actions he has \r\nconducted, in particular, those aiming at achieving the \r\ngoals and aspirations of all Member States in \r\npromoting the principle of the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. \r\n The Algerian delegation is deeply honoured to \r\nhold the chairmanship of the Agency’s Board of \r\nGovernors for this year. In that capacity, I have the \r\nhonour to introduce the draft resolution contained in \r\ndocument A/63/L.6. I would thank all sponsors listed \r\nin that document and in the addendum, which will be \r\nissued later. I would also like to say that the list of \r\nsponsors is still open. \r\n The draft resolution submitted for the Assembly’s \r\nconsideration reflects a broad consensus among the \r\nmember States of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), reached during earlier consultations in \r\nVienna. It is a simple, concise and factual text based on \r\nresolution 62/2, which the Assembly adopted by \r\nconsensus at its sixty-second session. The proposed \r\nresolution takes note of the annual report of the IAEA \r\nand the resolutions adopted by the Agency’s General \r\nConference, held in Vienna from 29 September to \r\n4 October 2008. It reaffirms the Assembly’s strong \r\nsupport for the indispensable role of the Agency in \r\nencouraging the development and practical application \r\nof atomic energy for peaceful uses and in technology \r\ntransfer to developing countries, as well as in nuclear \r\nsafety, verification and security. It also appeals to \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n5 08-56886 \r\n \r\nMember States to continue to support the work of the \r\nAgency. \r\n It is my hope that the General Assembly will \r\nadopt the draft resolution without a vote, as it did in its \r\nprevious session. \r\n Mr. De Rivière (France) (spoke in French): I am \r\nhonoured to take the floor on behalf of the European \r\nUnion and Croatia and Albania. The European Union \r\nwould like to congratulate the Secretariat of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, its Director General, for the \r\nAgency’s excellent work in the course of the past year. \r\nWe would also like to thank the Director General for \r\nhis report on the activities of the IAEA in 2008. \r\n The European Union member States are pleased \r\nwith the outcome of the 52nd General Conference of \r\nthe IAEA, held in Vienna from 29 September to \r\n4 October 2008, particularly with the resolutions and \r\ndecisions that were adopted there. \r\n As in the past, the European Union has \r\nco-sponsored the draft resolution on the report of the \r\nIAEA (A/63/L.6) and we support its content. The draft \r\nresolution, co-sponsored by more 41 countries, reflects \r\na broad agreement among the member States of the \r\nIAEA. We sincerely praise the efforts made by the \r\nChair of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and we \r\nhope that the draft resolution will be adopted by \r\nconsensus, as was the case last year. \r\n The three pillars of the IAEA Statute — \r\nverification, safety and nuclear applications — are \r\nmore topical than ever, with nuclear proliferation \r\nbuilding up throughout the world. As a result, the \r\nEuropean Union attaches great importance to the \r\ncontent of those pillars, because they contribute \r\nsignificantly to promoting peace and security in the \r\nworld. \r\n The European Union reaffirms its full support for \r\nthe work carried out by the Agency in serving the \r\nobjectives of peaceful nuclear cooperation and nuclear \r\nsafety. The IAEA remains the best qualified forum to \r\nensure responsible use of the inalienable right to the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy. We also acknowledge \r\nthat it plays a crucial role in the field of nuclear \r\nverification at the global level. That role is all the more \r\nvital, as the world is currently facing very disturbing \r\nproliferation crises. \r\n With respect to nuclear safety, we would like to \r\nmention once again the Agency’s Nuclear Security \r\nFund, which the European Union consistently supports. \r\nWe invite all States to commit to contribute to that \r\nFund without delay. \r\n The general safeguards agreements and additional \r\nprotocols of the Agency constitute the standard in the \r\narea of verification. The European Union believes that \r\nthey are prerequisites to an effective and credible \r\nsafeguards system. All member States of the IAEA \r\nmust honour all their obligations with respect to those \r\nsafeguards agreements.  \r\n The European Union is also working to make the \r\nadditional protocol a condition for the export of nuclear \r\nmaterials. Additional protocols have been in force since \r\nMay 2004 in all member States of the European Union. \r\nWe urge all States that have not yet done so to ratify \r\nthat protocol without delay. Adhering to that instrument \r\nis, indeed, one of the crucial ways to verify that States \r\nparties have respected their obligations under article III, \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. Equally, we call on all States that have not \r\nyet done so to sign and implement without delay their \r\nrespective safeguards agreements and additional \r\nprotocols, because those two instruments strengthen the \r\ninternational non-proliferation regime. They contribute \r\nto the safety of all States and increase the confidence \r\nnecessary for international cooperation with a view to \r\nthe exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy. \r\n In that regard, the European Union is pleased that \r\nimplementation of the additional protocol and \r\ntransparency measures that go beyond that instrument \r\nhas allowed the IAEA to conclude that there are no \r\nlonger any pending issues concerning verification in \r\nLibya and that inspections there can continue routinely. \r\n Through our joint action within the framework of \r\nthe European Union’s collective security and foreign \r\npolicy, we support the Agency’s nuclear verification \r\nand safety activities. We also support the strengthening \r\nof legislative competence and national regulations for \r\nthe implementation of international instruments on \r\nnuclear safety and on verification of nuclear materials \r\nand other radioactive matter. \r\n Strengthening the ability of States to detect and \r\nfight the illicit trade in nuclear materials and other \r\nradioactive matter is another significant area of \r\ncooperation between the European Union and the \r\nAgency. The safety and security of radioactive sources \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 6 \r\n \r\nand the role of the Code of Conduct adopted by the \r\nGeneral Conference of the Agency in 2003 are of \r\nparticular importance to us all. That is why the \r\nEuropean Union has made a commitment to respect the \r\nCode, in accordance with the European directive on the \r\ncontrol of high-activity sealed radioactive sources and \r\norphan sources. The European Union urges all \r\ncountries to declare their willingness to respect the \r\nCode and to implement the instructions for the import \r\nand export of radioactive sources. \r\n The Agency continues to play a fundamental role \r\nin the global fight against nuclear terrorism and the \r\nspread of nuclear weapons. It is important for the \r\nmembers of the Agency to recognize the true value of \r\nits impartial expertise. \r\n The European Union regrets that more than 100 \r\nStates have yet to sign additional protocols and to \r\nimplement them. We urge those States to do so without \r\ndelay. \r\n The Agency must continue to contribute \r\nresolutely to reducing all risks linked to nuclear \r\nactivity, both from the point of view of safety and the \r\ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime. In that \r\nregard, the European Union believes that it is time to \r\ndevelop practical measures with respect to multilateral \r\napproaches to the fuel cycle. Balanced multilateral \r\nmechanisms would significantly contribute to meeting \r\nthe concerns of beneficiary countries concerning the \r\nsafety of supply by facilitating access to nuclear fuel \r\nand associated services, by reducing the need to invest \r\nin complex and expensive cycle technologies and by \r\nreducing concerns with respect to nuclear proliferation \r\nand safety.  \r\n Additionally, the EU is currently carefully \r\nconsidering the possibility of making a financial \r\ncontribution to the ambitious nuclear fuel bank project \r\nunder the auspices of IAEA. The EU would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the Agency for its efforts in \r\ncreating a more peaceful and safer world and would \r\nlike to reaffirm its full support. It is our great pleasure \r\nto once again this year sponsor the draft resolution on \r\nthe Agency’s report. \r\n Mr. De Macedo Soares (Brazil) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to speak on behalf of \r\nthe Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) \r\nmember and associated States: Argentina, Brazil, \r\nBolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, \r\nUruguay and Venezuela.  \r\n MERCOSUR member and associated States \r\nwould like to thank the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nMr. Mohammed ElBaradei, for his presence and his \r\npresentation of the main aspects of the Agency’s \r\nactivities. We would like to thank the Algerian \r\ndelegation for its presentation of the draft resolution \r\n(A/63/L.6) on the Agency’s report. We would also like \r\nto express our satisfaction with the successful \r\nconclusion of the Presidency of the Board of \r\nGovernors by Chile, one of the MERCOSUR member \r\nand associated States. \r\n The IAEA constitutes a fundamental multilateral \r\nforum dedicated to the promotion of the peaceful uses \r\nof atomic energy. Our countries highly appreciate the \r\nAgency and the efforts undertaken to define its future \r\nactivities. In this connection, MERCOSUR member \r\nand associated States would like to thank the Director \r\nGeneral for the creation of the Commission of Eminent \r\nPersons, charged with the task of analysing the \r\nevolution of the needs and circumstances that will \r\naffect the work and functions of the Agency until 2020 \r\nand beyond. \r\n The Commission constitutes a valuable initiative \r\nthat can contribute to a better understanding of the \r\nfuture challenges of the Agency and the issues that will \r\nneed to be discussed by member States, which continue \r\nto be the ones responsible for determining the priorities \r\nof the Agency’s future activities. \r\n The report tackles issues of different nature and \r\ncomplexity, and its suggestions will undoubtedly be of \r\ngreat use in the analysis and discussions among \r\nmember States about the role of the Agency until 2020. \r\nWe take note of the increasing importance attributed by \r\nthe Agency’s report to its safeguards activities. We \r\nconsider that such activities constitute one of the \r\nstatutory pillars and should not serve to weaken the \r\npromotional functions of the Agency. \r\n MERCOSUR member and associated States are \r\nconcerned about compliance by all States parties to the \r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) with their \r\nobligations in the fields of nuclear disarmament, \r\nnuclear non-proliferation and the promotion of \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. In this context, we \r\nunderline the inalienable right of States to develop \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes in accordance \r\nwith article IV of the NPT. \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n7 08-56886 \r\n \r\n Allow me to stress that any intent to redefine the \r\ndelicate balance of rights and obligations contained in \r\nthe Treaty, and, in so doing, to question the legitimacy \r\nof member States’ aspirations to technological \r\ndevelopment for exclusively peaceful purposes may \r\ncontribute to a weakening of the system that the Treaty \r\nhas created and that enjoys general acceptance. \r\n MERCOSUR member and associated States \r\nexpress full support for the authority of the Agency as \r\nthe competent body to verify compliance on the part of \r\nmember States with their obligations under safeguards \r\nagreements.  \r\n In connection with the so-called assurances of \r\nsupply of nuclear fuel and the Agency’s potential role \r\nin that regard, we believe the issue still requires a deep \r\nanalysis by all member States. It is imperative that this \r\nconcept not weaken the rights enshrined in the NPT nor \r\ndisturb the delicate balance of the Treaty. \r\n We recognize the importance of technical \r\ncooperation and assistance in the multilateral field \r\nthrough active participation in the IAEA Technical \r\nCooperation Programme and the Cooperation \r\nAgreement for the Promotion of Nuclear Science and \r\nTechnology in Latin America and the Caribbean, under \r\nthe presidency of Argentina since last September. \r\n We also recognize with satisfaction the efforts of \r\nthe Agency and member States aimed at strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation in the field of nuclear and \r\nradiological security, transport and management of \r\nwaste. In particular, we would like to highlight the \r\nprogress achieved in the various activities aimed at \r\nmaintaining and increasing security, such as the \r\ninformation and telecommunication networks for \r\nnuclear radiological safety and the national and \r\nregulatory infrastructure in charge of radioactive \r\nsources. \r\n We also underline the efficacy of the IAEA \r\nverification system as an instrument to assure the \r\ninternational community of the peaceful purposes of \r\nnuclear programmes. Without prejudice, we consider \r\nthat efforts to improve the efficiency of safeguards \r\nshould continue, with the help of member States. \r\n Allow me to make special mention of the \r\ncommon system of accounting and control applied by \r\nthe Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and \r\nControl of Nuclear Materials, as well as the valuable \r\ncooperation between this Agency and the IAEA. At the \r\nbilateral level, we welcome the letter, dated 3 March \r\n2008, sent by Argentina and Brazil to the IAEA on the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\n Given the medium-term projections of a \r\nsubstantial increase in the use of nuclear electric \r\nenergy and cognizant of the fact that access to viable \r\nsources of sufficient energy is fundamental to \r\ndevelopment, we support the efforts undertaken by the \r\nIAEA to strengthen activities related to nuclear science \r\nand technology and their growing contribution to the \r\nresolution of key issues for member States in vital \r\nareas such as agriculture, food, human health, energy \r\nproduction, management of water resources and \r\nenvironmental protection. \r\n Similarly, we note the work of the Agency with \r\nregard to the renewed interest in nuclear electric \r\nenergy, and we support efforts to ensure that all \r\ndevelopments in that field are accessible to all those \r\ninterested in nuclear energy. \r\n We believe the long-term management and \r\ndisposal of spent fuel and waste continues to be a \r\nchallenge in light of the growing use of nuclear electric \r\nenergy and the increase in the spent fuel inventory. We \r\nrecognize the efforts of the secretariat on the options \r\nfor the final geological disposal of high-level waste, \r\nlong-lived waste and spent fuel. \r\n To conclude, allow me to express our support for \r\nIAEA efforts to combat nuclear and radiological \r\nterrorism and for the activities of the Agency aimed at \r\nthe universal application of international legal \r\ninstruments on the physical protection of materials in \r\nnuclear installations and radioactive sources. \r\n Ms. Chabau (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): Cuba \r\nconsiders that the technical cooperation activities of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) play \r\nan essential role, since they enable the application of \r\nnuclear technologies and sciences to benefit social and \r\neconomic development. \r\n The Agency’s technical cooperation pillar must \r\nbe strengthened and given the necessary resources, \r\nunconditionally and in accordance with its priority. The \r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy, for instance, \r\nis evidence of the benefits of nuclear technology in \r\nimportant areas for people. Such programmes must be \r\ngiven the necessary resources for their effective \r\nimplementation. \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 8 \r\n \r\n Nuclear technologies are applied in Cuba in vital \r\nareas, namely public health care, agriculture, food, \r\nhydrology and environmental protection. That explains \r\nour strong commitment to the promotion of IAEA \r\ntechnical cooperation activities. \r\n Last year, Cuba met its financial obligations with \r\nrespect to the IAEA Technical Cooperation Fund on \r\ntime and in full. Over 90 per cent of our national \r\nprojects were implemented, and our country provided \r\n30 international experts and 11 professors. \r\n The priority Cuba accords to cooperation among \r\ndeveloping countries is evidenced by our participation \r\nin Coordinated Research Programmes and the Regional \r\nCooperative Arrangements for the Promotion of \r\nNuclear Science and Technology in Latin America. \r\n Cuba’s commitment and capacity to participate in \r\nactions under the important IAEA technical \r\ncooperation pillar are adversely affected as a \r\nconsequence of the illegal and criminal economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade that the United \r\nStates Government has imposed on Cuba for nearly \r\nfive decades. According to conservative calculations, \r\nas of December 2007 the blockade has resulted in \r\nlosses of over $93 billion for Cuba.  \r\n As a result of this criminal policy, it continues to \r\nbe difficult for our country to acquire the very \r\nimportant equipment and reagents needed for technical \r\ncooperation projects. Likewise, the visas for Cuban \r\nspecialists are denied to prevent them from \r\nparticipating in the IAEA technical meetings that take \r\nplace in the United States. \r\n All the fields in which the IAEA acts under its \r\nmandate are important and an adequate balance among \r\nthem must be kept. Cuba rejects any attempt to favour \r\nthe rest of the Agency’s pillars to the detriment of the \r\ntechnical cooperation, which needs stable and \r\npredictable resources. \r\n Cuba will actively participate in the consideration \r\nof the report on the role of the IAEA up to 2020 and \r\nbeyond. We are convinced that the elaboration of the \r\nAgency’s vision for the future has to be the outcome of \r\na comprehensive and deep analysis process, which \r\nincludes the active participation of all member States. \r\n Our country rejects any attempt to use nuclear \r\nfuel supply as a means of political or economic \r\ncoercion or as a mechanism to establish the monopoly \r\nof a few countries over the distribution of such fuel. \r\nLikewise, we oppose any attempt to impose safeguards \r\nobligations on some States that go beyond their legal \r\ncommitments. \r\n Cuba attaches great importance to radiation \r\nsafety. We continue, in our country, to develop the \r\nrequired infrastructure and to train the necessary staff \r\nin this field. Our country is proud of its results \r\nconcerning non-proliferation, reflected in the report \r\nsubmitted to the IAEA Board of Governors in March. It \r\nis important to highlight that — merely 4 years after \r\nCuba signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, full-\r\nscope safeguards agreements and an additional \r\nprotocol — we find ourselves in a small group of \r\n47 countries in which the IAEA secretariat did not find \r\nany diversion of declared nuclear material nor any \r\nindication of non-declared nuclear material or \r\nactivities. \r\n We reaffirm that the Agency’s verification \r\nactivities must be carried out in an impartial and \r\nunbiased manner. All attempts to put pressure on or \r\nimproperly interfere with verification activities, which \r\njeopardize the efficiency and credibility of such \r\nactivities, must be rejected. Verification must preserve \r\nits essentially technical character. \r\n Cuba reaffirms its conviction that only \r\nunconditional dialogue based on equality and mutual \r\nrespect will lead to the solution of the so-called Iran \r\nnuclear case. The inalienable right of States, including \r\nIran, to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, \r\nwithout discrimination and in accordance with their \r\nrespective legal obligations, must be strictly respected. \r\nThe IAEA is the only relevant authority that can verify \r\nthe fulfilment of the obligations undertaken under the \r\nsafeguard agreements of member States. \r\n Notwithstanding the proclaimed end of the cold \r\nwar, there are some 25,000 nuclear weapons in the \r\nworld, 10,200 of which are ready for immediate use. \r\nNuclear weapons upgrading programmes have not been \r\nhalted. Instead of supporting nuclear disarmament, \r\nwhich is and must continue to be the highest priority in \r\nthe field of disarmament, we see the promotion of \r\nstockpiling arms and wasting money on new weapons \r\nand weapons systems. The mere existence of nuclear \r\nweapons and doctrines based on their possession and \r\nuse, poses a serious danger to international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Cuba rejects the selective implementation of the \r\nNPT. Issues related to nuclear disarmament and the \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n9 08-56886 \r\n \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy must not continue to be \r\ndisregarded while horizontal non-proliferation \r\nflourishes. I would like to close by reiterating Cuba’s \r\nfull support for the important work of the IAEA in the \r\npromotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in a \r\nsecure way. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my gratitude to \r\nMr. ElBaradei, Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his valuable efforts \r\nand for the insightful report to the General Assembly on \r\nthe main activities of the Agency during the year 2007.  \r\n As he rightly mentioned, access to reliable and \r\nadequate sources of energy is essential for \r\ndevelopment. The demand for energy around the world \r\nhas been growing significantly in the past decade and \r\nwill continue to do so in the future. As a renewable \r\nsource of energy, nuclear energy provides an attractive \r\nand appropriate option for many countries. Nuclear \r\npower would not only help to meet the increased \r\ndemand for energy, but would also serve as a \r\nclimatically benign source of energy. That has led a \r\nsubstantial number of countries, in particular \r\ndeveloping countries, to embark upon planning for the \r\nconstruction of nuclear power reactors as well as \r\nsignificant expansions in their existing programmes. \r\n As Mr. ElBaradei also mentioned, a nuclear \r\nrenaissance is on the horizon. In this context and given \r\nthe mandate and scientific capabilities of the IAEA, the \r\nAgency has a special mandate in relation to the \r\nmanagement and strengthening of civilian use of \r\nnuclear power. Efforts to strengthen those technical \r\ncooperation activities of the Agency aimed at \r\nimproving the capabilities of developing countries in \r\nnuclear energy production as a component of their \r\nenergy mix should be pursued as a matter of priority. \r\n The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) has reaffirmed the important objective \r\nof the Agency and recognized the inalienable right of \r\nall NPT States parties to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. Under article IV of the NPT, States parties have \r\nundertaken to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of \r\nequipment, materials and scientific and technological \r\ninformation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In \r\nfact, the inalienable right of all NPT States parties to \r\nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes, without \r\ndiscrimination, constitutes one of the three major \r\npillars upon which the NPT is founded. \r\nNotwithstanding such requirements, cooperation by \r\ndeveloped countries, the main suppliers of nuclear high \r\ntechnology, with developing nations has remained at an \r\nunsatisfactory level. \r\n In fact, nuclear cooperation between suppliers and \r\nrecipients has been beset by restrictions, obstacles and \r\ndisruption. Instead of promoting cooperation, a nuclear \r\nhaves club, replete with discrimination and lack of \r\ntransparency, has been created, inter alia, to hamper the \r\naccess of NPT-party developing countries to nuclear \r\npower technology under the pretext of non-proliferation \r\nconcerns. To remedy this shortcoming, the IAEA could \r\nand should play a decisive role by vigorously pursuing \r\na balanced and non-discriminatory application of the \r\nprovisions of the NPT and the IAEA safeguards. \r\nAttempts to politicize the work of the IAEA, including \r\nits technical cooperation programme, are in violation of \r\nthe IAEA Statute and will only impede the ability of the \r\nAgency to carry out its responsibilities in an orderly \r\nfashion. \r\n The application of safeguards is among the main \r\nfunctions of the Agency. While great efforts have been \r\nmade by the Agency to apply and promote the \r\nuniversality of the safeguards to all relevant nuclear \r\nactivities, it is distressing that some members of the \r\nAgency have yet to conclude their Comprehensive \r\nSafeguards Agreements. We call on all such members \r\nto fulfil their obligations at the earliest possible \r\nopportunity. \r\n Furthermore, there is a dangerous trend at work \r\nthat seeks to move away from preserving the NPT and \r\nensuring its universality. Under that trend, those who \r\nhave chosen not to accede to the NPT are not only \r\nsubject to no pressure to do so, but are also encouraged \r\nand rewarded in various ways including through \r\nnuclear cooperation. As an example, the Zionist regime \r\nhas been allowed to acquire a sizeable stockpile of \r\nnuclear weapons in the volatile Middle East region and \r\nto defy the will of all regional States and the \r\ninternational community to turn the Middle East into a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. \r\n I note the concerns raised today by Mr. ElBaradei \r\non the security aspects of the issue and the possible \r\ndiversion of peaceful nuclear activities into \r\nweaponization programmes. In this regard, I would like \r\nto emphasize the major concern there is about the \r\nnuclear activities of countries that are not party to the \r\nNPT and have nuclear weapons programmes. However, \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 10 \r\n \r\nwe should be cautious against creating the impression \r\nthat membership in the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon \r\nState may be an impediment to the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear technology. \r\n I would like to make some points regarding the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran’s peaceful nuclear program. \r\nIran, as a party to the NPT, considers the development \r\nof nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to be its \r\ninalienable right and has thus invested extensive \r\nhuman and material resources in the field of nuclear \r\npower. This policy is based on long-term planning \r\naimed at meeting the growing energy needs of the \r\ncountry. As we have stressed time and again, Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme has been, is and will remain \r\ncompletely peaceful. All reports issued by the IAEA \r\nsince November 2003 bear witness to the peaceful \r\nnature of the Iranian nuclear programme and the \r\nAgency has repeatedly reaffirmed that it has not seen \r\nindications of diversion of nuclear material to nuclear \r\nweapons or other nuclear explosive devices. As a result \r\nof Iran’s proactive cooperation and full transparency in \r\nthe implementation of the work plan agreed between \r\nIran and the IAEA in the summer of 2007, all \r\noutstanding safeguard implementation issues have been \r\nresolved and closed, as indicated by Mr. ElBaradei \r\ntoday. Naturally, according to the modality agreed in \r\nthe work plan recorded in IAEA document \r\nINFCIRC/711, the implementation of safeguards in \r\nIran must become normalized. In that regard, the IAEA \r\nsecretariat’s observance of the mutual understanding as \r\nreflected in the agreed work plan is key.  \r\n What have been characterized as alleged studies \r\nare nothing but fabricated documents given to the \r\nAgency by a certain country. They have nothing to do \r\nwith the verification issues emanating from the \r\nimplementation of the safeguards agreement regarding \r\nnuclear activities. In the meantime, Iran has been \r\ndenied originals or even copies of documents relating \r\nto those allegations. As a gesture of good faith, to the \r\nextent possible, we have already provided the IAEA \r\nwith our assessments of alleged studies.  \r\n Without a doubt, rather than stemming from \r\nso-called proliferation concerns, the move to bring the \r\nIranian nuclear file to the Security Council and the \r\nintention of the sponsors of resolutions adopted thus \r\nfar have emanated from their ulterior motives and \r\nnarrow national considerations in order to deprive the \r\nIranian people of their inalienable rights. In that \r\nregard, the demand for the suspension of enrichment is \r\nillegal, ultra vires and in contravention of the \r\nprovisions of the NPT. The Iranian nation will never \r\naccept illegal demands. \r\n The President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in \r\nhis address to the General Assembly on 23 September \r\n2008, reiterated that the Iranian nation is for dialogue. \r\nBy presenting various offers, including its proposed \r\npackage for constructive negotiations to the 5+1 Group \r\nin May 2008, Iran has already demonstrated its firm \r\ndetermination to hold negotiations without \r\npreconditions to find solutions to issues arising from \r\nthe unjust and prejudicial approach of certain Powers. \r\nThe 5+1 Group has yet to provide its response to Iran’s \r\nproposed package. The policy of a few Powers to insist \r\non suspension as a precondition for negotiations bears \r\nzero relation to reality and is an irrational and failed \r\npolicy. Instead of applying economic leverage and \r\npolitical pressure, a solution that is based on reality, \r\ncommon concerns and obligations should be pursued as \r\na viable alternative. \r\n Finally, the people and the Government of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran are determined to exercise \r\ntheir inalienable right to nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful purposes and to build on their own scientific \r\nadvances in developing various peaceful aspects of that \r\ntechnology, including the fuel cycle. Iran’s \r\ncommitment to its obligations under the NPT is \r\nsteadfast. We ask nothing more than to exercise our \r\ninalienable rights.  \r\n Mr. Baum (Switzerland) (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of my delegation, I would like to thank \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and all \r\nthe staff of the Agency’s secretariat for the excellent \r\nwork they have done in the past year. The latest annual \r\nreport (see A/63/276) is a testament to the excellent \r\nquality and scope of their work. We express our full \r\nsupport for the Agency. We are pleased to once again \r\nbe a sponsor of the draft resolution (A/63/L.6) on the \r\nIAEA’s annual report. We hope that the draft resolution \r\nwill, as usual, be adopted by consensus. \r\n The IAEA is currently at a crossroads, to employ \r\nthe word used by Mr. ElBaradei at the opening of the \r\nAgency’s fifty-second General Conference in \r\nSeptember of this year. That word is fully justified \r\ngiven two important developments that have emerged \r\nsince the last session of the General Assembly, which \r\nwe wish to refer to by way of illustration. \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n11 08-56886 \r\n \r\n First, the report of the Commission of Eminent \r\nPersons on the future of the agency, headed by former \r\nMexican President Ernesto Zedillo, which is known as \r\nthe 20/20 report, stressed the fact that progress in the \r\narea of nuclear disarmament is essential to advancing \r\nthe guarantee agenda. \r\n Secondly, the decision by the Nuclear Suppliers \r\nGroup to waive the application of generalized \r\nguarantees as a condition for nuclear cooperation with \r\nIndia undoubtedly creates new challenges with regard \r\nto the application of the IAEA system of generalized \r\nguarantees, including the Additional Protocol. It is \r\nnecessary to acknowledge that the non-proliferation \r\nregime as we know it has reached a turning point and \r\nthat we must, without further delay, initiate a process \r\nof reflection in order to establish the appropriate basis \r\nto achieve the goal of a universal non-proliferation \r\nregime. \r\n My delegation believes that those two aspects are \r\nclosely linked. We must be careful to ensure that \r\ncertain recent developments do not further complicate \r\nthe increasing challenge faced by the IAEA because of \r\nthe balance that it must preserve between its activities \r\nin the area of cooperation on civil nuclear technology, \r\non the one hand, and its activities to control the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear technology, on the other. \r\nSwitzerland, which is currently a member of the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors, will continue to strongly support \r\nthe Agency as its carries out its mission. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nBelarus, which was present at the founding of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), very \r\nactively supports the Agency’s activities. We are \r\nsatisfied that the Agency has become a highly regarded \r\nand cautious organization that strives to ensure that \r\nnuclear energy is used in the safest possible manner \r\nand for exclusively peaceful purposes. The Agency \r\nalso works actively to resolve a set of pressing \r\ninternational problems. Its activities are characterized \r\nby a high degree of professionalism.  \r\n Belarus reiterates its consistent position with \r\nregard to the need to strengthen the Agency’s status. \r\nWe believe that global trends in the areas of energy and \r\neconomic development require a further strengthening \r\nof the role of the IAEA. In order to ensure its \r\nsustainable economic development, Belarus took the \r\ndecision to build its first nuclear power plant. That was \r\npreceded by a long, in-depth and comprehensive \r\nanalysis. The need to ensure energy security, reduce \r\ncarbon emissions and increase trust in safety indicators \r\nregarding the operation of nuclear power plants, as \r\nwell as the economic advantages and competitiveness \r\nof nuclear energy, were all factors that had an impact \r\non our decision to develop a peaceful national nuclear \r\nprogramme. \r\n Work is currently under way in Belarus to \r\nestablish and improve the necessary capacity and \r\ninfrastructure to implement a large-scale nuclear \r\nenergy project. We are drafting and adopting nuclear-\r\nenergy-related legislation and improving the structures \r\nthat regulate nuclear and radiological safety. Work is \r\nalso under way to select a site for the construction of \r\nthe nuclear power plant.  \r\n Belarus is keen to establish the closest possible \r\ncooperation with the IAEA in implementing our \r\nnational nuclear programme. We believe that the active \r\ntechnical and expert cooperation provided by the \r\nAgency to States implementing nuclear programmes is \r\nof critical importance to establishing the basic \r\nfoundations for the safe utilization of nuclear energy \r\nthroughout the world. Belarus gives priority attention \r\nto nuclear safety issues. We are especially interested in \r\ninternational cooperation in the area of the safe and \r\nreliable operation of nuclear facilities, including the \r\nmanagement of radioactive sources and spent nuclear \r\nfuel.  \r\n More than anyone else, we in Belarus are aware \r\nof the possible consequences of the lack of appropriate \r\nsafety mechanisms in the operation of nuclear power \r\nplants. Belarus has suffered more than any other \r\ncountry in the world as a result of the worst man-made \r\ndisaster of the twentieth century, which occurred at the \r\nChernobyl nuclear power plant. Belarus intends to \r\ncontinue to cooperate closely with the IAEA on issues \r\npertaining to the rehabilitation of areas that were \r\ncontaminated in the Chernobyl disaster. We expect the \r\nAgency to participate actively in the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Action Plan on Chernobyl to 2016 \r\nand in the Decade of Recovery and Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of the Affected Regions.  \r\n Belarus does not intend to limit itself to the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear energy. We have decided that \r\nindependence from any single source in the operation \r\nof any system — from financial systems to energy \r\nsystems — makes it possible to avoid crises, including \r\nglobal ones. We are resolute supporters of diversifying \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 12 \r\n \r\nenergy sources and supplies, including by \r\nmainstreaming alternative technologies and renewable \r\nsources of energy. That is one of the foundations of the \r\npolicy of responsible international cooperation in the \r\narea of energy championed by Belarus. \r\n There is a need to ensure fair access by all States \r\nto energy conservation technologies that are clean and \r\neconomically rational and that exploit new sources of \r\nenergy through a global United Nations mechanism to \r\nregulate the process. In that regard, during the course \r\nof this session of the General Assembly, we intend to \r\nhold a thematic debate on ensuring access by all States \r\nto energy conservation technologies and the use of \r\nalternative and renewable sources of energy while, of \r\ncourse, taking into account the issue of intellectual \r\nproperty rights.  \r\n It is clear that there is a need for a comprehensive \r\napproach to the energy crisis. That is why we welcome \r\nthe decision of Mr. ElBaradei, Director General of the \r\nIAEA, to establish an international energy \r\norganization. We share the view regarding the need for \r\ncoordinated efforts in the area of energy and related \r\nfields, such as socio-economic development, climate \r\nchange and poverty reduction. \r\n One of the core functions of the IAEA’s activities \r\nis to strengthen the international nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime established. Belarus believes \r\nthat, while taking into account the provisions of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT) and the Statute of the IAEA, existing \r\ninternational mechanisms must work together to ensure \r\nequal and non-discriminatory access by all interested \r\nStates to the benefits of nuclear energy. We cannot \r\nagree to a practice whereby the readiness to cooperate \r\nin the area of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is \r\nused by developed States as a way to exert political \r\npressure on developing States. We believe that such a \r\npeaceful nuclear bludgeon should not be used in cases \r\nwhere Governments comply with their commitments in \r\nthe area of non-proliferation.  \r\n In current circumstances, given the new threats \r\nand challenges facing the international community, the \r\nrole of the NPT and that of the IAEA as the sole \r\ninternational organization established to ensure the \r\nnecessary balance between the development of the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy and compliance with \r\nthe regime established by the Treaty is increasingly \r\nimportant. Belarus attaches great importance to the \r\nAgency’s work to improve and strengthen the \r\neffectiveness of its efforts in the area of safeguards.  \r\n By signing an additional protocol to its safeguards \r\nagreement in 2005, my country once again reaffirmed \r\nits commitment to the principles of the non-proliferation \r\nof nuclear weapons and the strengthening of the \r\nAgency’s authority in that area. We also recognize the \r\nrole of the international export control regime. We in \r\nBelarus have established an effective national system \r\nfor exports control. As a member of the Nuclear \r\nSuppliers Group, Belarus strictly abides by the Group’s \r\nGuidelines on the supply and control of products.  \r\n We believe that the international community’s \r\nnon-proliferation efforts must be complemented by \r\nconcrete steps in the area of nuclear disarmament and \r\nby the establishment and development of confidence-\r\nbuilding measures between nuclear and non-nuclear \r\nStates. At the same time, we base our policies on the \r\nusefulness of a comprehensive and realistic approach \r\nto processes related to non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament. In that regard, we should bear in mind \r\nthat one of the most important goals of those processes \r\nis to establish a sound basis for enabling States to \r\nexercise their right to peaceful nuclear activities in \r\naccordance with the provisions of the NPT and the \r\nStatute of the IAEA. \r\n In conclusion, we wish the Agency and its \r\nDirector General every success in their multifaceted \r\nefforts in the area of the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. \r\n Mr. Gumbi (South Africa): South Africa would \r\nalso like to congratulate the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the \r\nAgency’s annual report (see A/63/276) for 2007. The \r\nreport shows that the Agency’s activities are still \r\nrelevant and vital to enhancing the use of nuclear \r\nenergy for economic and social development and in \r\npreventing its diversion to non-peaceful uses. The \r\nreport also instils confidence in the Agency’s \r\ndetermination to accelerate and enlarge the \r\ncontribution of atomic energy to health and prosperity \r\nthroughout the world in a professional, efficient and \r\nresponsible manner. \r\n My delegation would also like to thank the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria, in its capacity as Chairperson \r\nof the IAEA Board of Governors, for introducing the \r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/63/L.6 for the \r\nAssembly’s usual consensus adoption. \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n13 08-56886 \r\n \r\n South Africa concurs with the observation of the \r\nAgency regarding the central role of nuclear power at a \r\ntime of a growing shortfall in energy and rising fossil \r\nfuel prices. It is encouraging that, in making that \r\nobservation, the Agency has been equally mindful of \r\nthe need to continue to seek innovative technologies \r\naimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of \r\nnuclear power through the International Project on \r\nInnovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO). \r\nSouth Africa has gained much from its active \r\nparticipation in INPRO, which has proven to be a \r\nuseful forum for studying innovative nuclear energy \r\nsystems and associated requirements. South Africa \r\nwelcomes the publication by the Agency of \r\nrecommendations on INPRO methodology for the \r\nevaluation of different innovative nuclear energy \r\nsystems. South Africa is certain that more benefits will \r\naccrue from INPRO’s second phase, which will focus \r\non innovative approaches to infrastructure and \r\ninstitutional development for countries beginning \r\nnuclear power programmes and on the establishment of \r\ncollaborative projects between its members. My \r\ndelegation also commends the activities of the \r\nGeneration IV International Forum and the role played \r\nby that initiative in research activities on six next-\r\ngeneration nuclear energy systems. \r\n South Africa believes that the Agency’s role in \r\ncreating an enabling environment for applications of \r\nnuclear technology — including as regards plant \r\nbreeding for greater food security, the sterile insect \r\ntechnique to control insect pests, the effective \r\nmanagement of water and life-saving medical \r\nprocedures — constitutes a creative contribution to the \r\nimprovement of living standards and the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n With regard to the food and agriculture sector, my \r\ndelegation would like to encourage the Agency to \r\ncontinue to assist Member States with tools for rapid \r\ndiagnosis and protocols for animal disease early \r\nwarning systems, as well as the provision of training to \r\nincrease the use of nuclear and nuclear-related \r\nmolecular diagnostic technologies. South Africa has \r\nnoted with appreciation that the Agency’s technical \r\ncooperation and coordinated research projects in the \r\narea of agriculture and food production supported more \r\nthan 60 Member States in 2007. \r\n My delegation likewise looks forward to greater \r\ncooperation between the Agency and South Africa’s \r\ncitrus industry in the fight against the false codling \r\nmoth by integrating the use of the sterile insect \r\ntechnique with other control tactics. My delegation \r\nalso welcomes the progress made by the Agency in \r\nexamining the feasibility of using the sterile insect \r\ntechnique against the malaria-transmitting mosquito. \r\n Like many other developing countries, South \r\nAfrica is very much aware of the instrumental role of \r\nwater security in advancing socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. It is for that reason that my delegation \r\nfully supports the Agency’s activities in the \r\nmanagement of water resources, including its efforts to \r\nbring isotope hydrology into the mainstream of \r\nnational and international water-resources-related \r\nprogrammes.  \r\n South Africa believes that human health is yet \r\nanother important area where the applications of \r\nnuclear technology play an important role. In that \r\nconnection, my delegation welcomes the strengthening \r\nof collaboration between the Agency, the World Health \r\nOrganization, UNICEF and other partners in the area of \r\nnutrition and cancer. South Africa strongly supports the \r\nAgency’s programme of action on cancer therapy, as \r\nmore than 40 per cent of all cancers can be prevented \r\nand more than 30 per cent can be cured if detected \r\nearly and treated. \r\n Although the Agency’s annual report for 2007 \r\nstates that the nuclear industry has continued to \r\ndemonstrate a high level of safety and security around \r\nthe world, South Africa believes that nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity is an important area that deserves continuous \r\nserious attention. It is a cause of concern that in the \r\nperiod under review there was slow progress in the \r\nnumber of accessions to and ratifications of the various \r\nsafety conventions, which are important in improving \r\nsafety performance and raising public confidence. \r\n Despite those shortcomings, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the Agency’s publication of new safety \r\nrequirements and guides, as well as the use of safety \r\nservices to support the wider application of those \r\nstandards. My delegation also commends the Agency \r\nfor its activities in the areas of the control of \r\nradioactive sources, the management of radioactive \r\nwaste and decommissioning, radiation protection for \r\npatients, incident and emergency preparedness and \r\nresponse, and civil liability for nuclear damage. With \r\nregard to nuclear security, my delegation encourages \r\nthe Agency to continue its good work to enhance the \r\nsecurity of nuclear and other radioactive material. \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 14 \r\n \r\n South Africa agrees that the threat of nuclear \r\nterrorism is one of the major challenges facing the \r\nworld today. The issue of protecting against nuclear \r\nterrorism is important to South Africa, especially as we \r\nmay draw from the Agency’s expertise and require \r\nequipment in the overall security measures to be put in \r\nplace for the soccer world championship to be held in \r\nSouth Africa in 2010. \r\n My Government shares the Agency’s view that \r\nsafeguards and verification are instrumental in \r\nfacilitating the peaceful use of nuclear applications for \r\ndevelopment. However, additional work still needs to \r\nbe done. The Agency needs to be continuously \r\nequipped with the appropriate tools to instil \r\ninternational confidence in the fact that declared \r\nnuclear material around the world is fully accounted \r\nfor and that the IAEA is able to verify that nuclear \r\ncapabilities are being used for peaceful purposes only, \r\nas well as to provide assurances regarding the absence \r\nof undeclared nuclear materials and activities. \r\n South Africa believes that it is incumbent upon \r\nall States to build confidence and provide assurances \r\nthat nuclear capabilities are being used for peaceful \r\npurposes only. In that connection, my delegation urges \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to heed the calls regarding the \r\nactions they must undertake with regard to the \r\nimplementation of their NPT safeguards agreements \r\nwith the Agency. South Africa also calls on member \r\nStates to increase their cooperation with the Agency in \r\ndealing with the illicit network of nuclear proliferation \r\nactivities. \r\n South Africa recognizes the indispensable role \r\nthat the additional protocol can play as a further \r\nmeasure to provide the necessary confidence and the \r\ndesired assurances that member States apply their \r\nnuclear technology solely for peaceful purposes and \r\nthat no declared or undeclared material is diverted to \r\nweapons programmes. Inasmuch as the additional \r\nprotocol is voluntary, South Africa believes that it is an \r\nimportant confidence- and security-building measure \r\nthat continues to play an essential role in creating a \r\nconducive environment for nuclear disarmament and \r\nnuclear non-proliferation. But it should not be used as \r\na condition of supply for nuclear material. \r\n It would be remiss of my delegation to conclude \r\nits statement without reference to the Agency’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Fund. South Africa believes that \r\nthe Agency’s Technical Cooperation Fund deserves \r\nurgent and decisive action. The Fund is a statutory and \r\npolitical commitment that needs to be realized. The \r\nAgency’s technical cooperation projects constitute \r\nimportant building blocks to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and to implement the projects of \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development, \r\nespecially in the areas of water security and combating \r\ndisease, hunger and poverty. \r\n Over the years, developing countries have \r\nrepeatedly stressed the need for the funding of the \r\nAgency’s cooperation projects to be sufficient, \r\npredictable and assured. They have also stressed the \r\nneed to increase the technical cooperation budget, as it \r\nis clearly insufficient. South Africa believes that the \r\ntime has arrived to conclusively correct the mistake of \r\nthe past 50 years by incorporating the funding of \r\ntechnical cooperation projects into the regular budget. \r\n As we have done in the past, I would like to \r\nconclude my statement by reiterating South Africa’s \r\nstrongly held view that continuous and irreversible \r\nprogress in nuclear disarmament and other related \r\nnuclear arms control measures remains fundamental to \r\nthe promotion of nuclear non-proliferation. The \r\nsystematic and progressive elimination of all nuclear \r\nweapons and the assurance that they will never be \r\nproduced again remain the only guarantee against their \r\nuse. That should remain our goal. Nuclear disarmament \r\nand nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same \r\ncoin and are mutually reinforcing. The verifiable and \r\nirreversible elimination of nuclear weapons would \r\nprevent their use, irrespective of whose hands they \r\nwere in. That would effectively curb their proliferation, \r\nbecause you cannot proliferate what you do not have. \r\n Mr. Orkeldeen (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I should like to express my gratitude to \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his \r\nintroduction of the Agency’s annual report (see \r\nA/63/276) for the consideration of the General \r\nAssembly. I should also like to thank him for the \r\ninformation it contains about the Agency’s plans and \r\nprogrammes of action in the area of technical \r\ncooperation to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy and maintain the international nuclear safety \r\nand security facilities. All of that attests to the growing \r\nrole of the Agency as regards the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy and development. \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n15 08-56886 \r\n \r\n The Sudan attaches special importance to \r\ntechnological nuclear applications in the area of food \r\nsecurity and the use of state-of-the-art technologies to \r\ncontrol insects and manage hydrological resources, \r\nboth of which are necessary components in the \r\ndevelopment of irrigation and large-scale agricultural \r\nprojects. We therefore hope that we will continue to \r\nenjoy cooperation with UNICEF in the fields of \r\neducation and agriculture and with the World Health \r\nOrganization in those areas. The Agency’s assistance to \r\nStates in carrying out their development projects serves \r\nto complement those efforts. We hope that the Agency \r\nwill continue to expand its sanitation projects on the \r\nregional and continental levels to combat insects that \r\ncarry infectious diseases such as malaria, so that the \r\ncontinent can combat such deadly diseases and \r\npromote its social and economic development, as well \r\nas the MDGs. \r\n The delegation of Sudan underscores the \r\ninalienable right of peoples and States to engage in the \r\nuse of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without \r\ndiscrimination. We also underscore the principle that \r\nStates must refrain from politicizing the vital role of \r\nthe Agency lest they damage its credibility. On the \r\nbasis of that principle, we would like to see those \r\nissues addressed in a fair, equitable manner through \r\ndialogue and negotiations in order to find appropriate \r\nsolutions.  \r\n Sudan would like to underscore its support for \r\npeoples’ aspirations to turn certain regions of the world \r\ninto nuclear-weapon-free zones, which is one of the \r\nfundamental principles for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Unfortunately, \r\nalthough for decades now it has striven to achieve that \r\nobjective, the Middle East is far from that goal. \r\nUnfortunately, Israel, the only State that possesses \r\nnuclear weapons in the region, has, to date, refused to \r\nplace its nuclear programme under IAEA safeguards \r\nand has disregarded all appeals by the international \r\ncommunity to comply. A commitment by Israel to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand its Additional Protocol would strengthen the \r\nmaintenance of peace in the region.  \r\n My country’s delegation welcomes the Agency’s \r\nefforts on the African continent. We welcome the \r\nincreased budget for fighting disease and for medical \r\nsupport in that field. We call upon the Agency to \r\ndevote additional resources to the fight against disease \r\nand poverty throughout the world and the African \r\ncontinent in particular.  \r\n Mr. Alazemi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly is discussing today an important \r\nitem on its agenda that is closely associated with the \r\nprinciples on which the United Nations was founded, \r\nnamely, the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Having reviewed the annual report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the State \r\nof Kuwait expresses its most sincere appreciation to \r\nthe Director General of the Agency, Mr. Mohamed \r\nElBaradei, and all his staff for the efforts they have \r\nmade and for their tireless work to achieve the \r\nobjectives and aspirations of the world’s peoples and \r\nStates by strengthening the principles of the peaceful \r\nuse of nuclear energy for the good of humanity. \r\n We also convey our thanks and gratitude to the \r\nPermanent Representative of Algeria for introducing to \r\nthe General Assembly the draft resolution on the report \r\nof the IAEA for the year 2007 (A/63/L.6), for which \r\nmy country will vote. \r\n The State of Kuwait, since it joined the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) on \r\n15 August 1986, has concentrated on cooperation with \r\nthe Department of Technical Cooperation of the IAEA \r\nand on the implementation of a set of projects dealing \r\nwith building its own capacities and establishing \r\nspecial laboratories to measure the level of radioactive \r\nisotopes found in Kuwait’s water and soil. On the basis \r\nof its belief in the vital importance of training qualified \r\nnational professionals in the fields of protection from \r\nnuclear radiation and the safe handling of radioactive \r\nmaterials, my country took the initiative of hosting \r\nregional workshops in cooperation with the IAEA. \r\nMoreover, it continues to send trainees to attend \r\ntraining courses held at IAEA headquarters. \r\n Through its Technical Cooperation Programme, \r\nthe Agency plays a key role in the exchange and \r\ntransfer of nuclear information and know-how to \r\nmember States, in particular developing countries. The \r\nprogramme aims at facilitating the use of nuclear \r\nscience and related technologies and at meeting, in a \r\nsustainable manner, the economical and social needs of \r\nmember States through the safe use of nuclear power \r\nfor food production, health care, water resource \r\nmanagement and environmental protection. \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 16 \r\n \r\n In that context, we endorse what was contained in \r\nthe annual report of the Agency for 2007 concerning \r\nenhancing the capabilities of the member States in \r\napplied nuclear technologies. Such technologies are \r\naimed at removing obstacles to achieving sustainable \r\nfood security through the use of technology to remedy \r\nsoil deterioration, achieving a sustainable \r\nintensification of crop outputs and livestock \r\nproduction, combating pests by using sterile insect \r\ntechnology, improving the quality and safety of food \r\nand consolidating the efforts of the Agency to achieve \r\nsustainable food security. That is particularly important \r\nin the light of the international food crisis that most \r\nStates are witnessing. \r\n The vital and important role of the IAEA in \r\npreventing the use of nuclear power for military \r\npurposes and in promoting its exploitation for peaceful \r\npurposes in the safest possible ways can only be \r\nfulfilled through the concerted efforts of all States. The \r\nSupreme Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council has \r\ntherefore recommended that its member countries \r\nconduct a study to create a joint programme on nuclear \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes in accordance with \r\ninternational standards and regimes. \r\n We would also like to note that it is unfortunate \r\nthat, although the Agency has called on some States \r\nwith advanced nuclear capabilities and activities to join \r\nthe NPT and implement the IAEA comprehensive \r\nsafeguards, those calls have gone unheeded, with \r\nnegative effects for international peace and security. \r\n In that context, the goal of achieving peace and \r\nstability in the Middle East region will never be \r\naccomplished as long as Israel remains the only \r\ncountry in the region that refuses to subject its \r\nfacilities to the IAEA safeguards regime. That \r\nrepresents a key obstacle to achieving universality for \r\nthe NPT and seriously impedes the strengthening of the \r\nNPT regime. If that irregular situation persists, it could \r\nencourage other States in the region to seek the \r\npossession of nuclear weapons or to manufacture them, \r\nciting the Agency’s laxity in dealing with the countries \r\nthat refuse to subject their installations to inspection. \r\n In view of the intransigence of the Israeli position \r\non that matter, we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to pressure Israel to join the NPT and \r\nsubject all of its nuclear facilities to the safeguards \r\nregime of the IAEA. We affirm the right of all States in \r\nthe region to obtain the technology, know-how and \r\nneeded expertise to use nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes within the framework of the relevant \r\ninternational conventions, thus making the Middle East \r\nregion, including the Gulf area, free from nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. \r\n As regards the development of the Iranian nuclear \r\nissue and proceeding from our conviction of the need \r\nto respect international legitimacy and the principle of \r\npursuing a peaceful resolution to conflicts, the State of \r\nKuwait calls upon the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nto continue its cooperation with the IAEA with \r\ntransparency, in order to dispel the fears and doubts \r\nsurrounding the nature of its nuclear programme, \r\naddress all outstanding issues and give diplomatic \r\nefforts time to reach a peaceful solution through a \r\ndemonstration of flexibility, wisdom and responsibility \r\nby all parties concerned. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express my \r\ncountry’s hope that the international community will \r\ncontinue its support for the IAEA in its work to ensure \r\nthe full, non-selective implementation of all \r\ninternational agreements related to disarmament, \r\nincluding the NPT, with its three main pillars: nuclear \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy. \r\n Mr. Wang Qun (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation would like to thank Mr. ElBaradei, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), for the report (see A/63/276) on the \r\nwork of the Agency in 2007. We appreciate the \r\nenormous efforts and important role of the Agency in \r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and \r\npreventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. \r\n Over the past year, the Agency has come a long \r\nway in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\nThe Agency has provided assistance to member States \r\nthrough its nuclear power, nuclear applications and \r\ntechnical cooperation programmes to address \r\nchallenges they encounter in the areas of energy \r\nsupply, food security and environmental protection. \r\nPositive progress has been made in those areas.  \r\n Meanwhile, the Agency has also played a pivotal \r\nrole in safeguarding the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nmaterial and facilities and in preventing the \r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. China appreciates the \r\npositive role of the Agency in facilitating the peaceful \r\nresolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula \r\nand the Iranian nuclear issue. Over the past year, the \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n17 08-56886 \r\n \r\nAgency has applied safeguards in over 160 countries \r\nand worked actively to promote the signing of \r\nadditional protocols and implement the integrated \r\nsafeguards framework. \r\n The international momentum to develop nuclear \r\npower is today very strong. How to promote the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy by member States \r\nwhile preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\nis an important issue that has a bearing on the future \r\norientation of the Agency. China is of the view that the \r\nrole and function of the Agency should be adequately \r\nenhanced.  \r\n First, it is essential that the expertise of the \r\nAgency should be further enhanced so that it can better \r\nassist member States in establishing their nuclear \r\npower and applications infrastructure and in \r\naccelerating the pace and broadening the scope of the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy.  \r\n Secondly, the Agency should work further to \r\nstrengthen its nuclear safety regulatory system and \r\ncontinue to assist member States to establish sound and \r\neffective nuclear security systems.  \r\n Thirdly, the Agency should continue to address \r\nverification issues in an impartial and balanced manner \r\nand work to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of \r\nits safeguards system, so as to further promote the \r\nuniversality and effectiveness of the Additional \r\nProtocol. \r\n China has always actively supported and \r\nparticipated in the Agency’s technical cooperation \r\nprogrammes. We enjoy close cooperation with the \r\nAgency and the relevant member States. I am happy to \r\nrecall the very fruitful cooperation on nuclear security \r\nbetween China and the Agency during our preparations \r\nfor the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. The Agency sent \r\nqualified experts to China to provide advice and \r\ntraining. It also provided China with much-needed \r\nnuclear detection equipment. In May of this year, in the \r\nwake of the devastating earthquake that struck \r\nWenchuan in China’s Sichuan province, through its \r\ntechnical cooperation programme the Agency provided \r\nradioactive material detection equipment and relevant \r\ntraining. That played an important role in post-quake \r\nsearch operations using radioactive sources. The \r\nChinese Government wishes to express its sincere \r\nthanks to the Agency for all those efforts. \r\n As always, China will support the Agency and \r\nwill continue to work with other member States and the \r\nsecretariat to ensure that there is further progress in the \r\nAgency’s work. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I take great pleasure in welcoming \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and in \r\nthanking him for introducing the Agency’s annual \r\nreport. \r\n For over 50 years, the Agency has been the global \r\ncentre of cooperation in the field of the peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear energy. Russia has consistently championed \r\npromoting the Agency’s role and standing. We will \r\ncontinue to actively support the multifaceted activities \r\nof the IAEA. We appreciate the efforts of \r\nMr. ElBaradei, to whom the Agency owes a great deal \r\nof its success. \r\n We believe that further improving the IAEA’s \r\nactivities should be based on a balanced approach to \r\nthe implementation of all its mandated functions. We \r\nbelieve that the main task for the near future is to \r\nestablish the conditions under which all States parties \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) can freely and fully make use of the \r\nbenefits of nuclear energy in conformity with the \r\nrequirements of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. \r\n An example of successful cooperation is the \r\nAgency’s International Project on Innovative Nuclear \r\nReactors and Fuel Cycles, which has been implemented \r\non Russia’s initiative since 2000. We highly appreciate \r\nits results, the heightened international prestige it has \r\nacquired and the new positive trends in its \r\nimplementation and development. We intend to \r\ncontinue to support that project, including through \r\nfinancial means. \r\n The Russian Federation regards issues related to \r\nensuring access to nuclear-fuel-cycle services and \r\nresolving the problem of spent nuclear fuel and \r\nradioactive waste management as key to the large-scale \r\ndevelopment of nuclear energy. It is very clear that the \r\nAgency has a central role in promoting multilateral \r\napproaches, and we will actively support the Agency in \r\nthat regard. We are ready to work with all interested \r\nStates to define and harmonize initiatives as regards \r\nmultilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, where \r\nthat is feasible and possible. We have therefore \r\nconsistently implemented the Russian initiative to \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 18 \r\n \r\nestablish a global nuclear energy infrastructure, which \r\nwill enable us to ensure equitable access to nuclear \r\nenergy for all interested parties in strict compliance \r\nwith the provisions of the regime established by the \r\nNPT.  \r\n To achieve the goals set out in that initiative, an \r\ninternational uranium enrichment centre was \r\nestablished jointly with the Republic of Kazakhstan in \r\n2007 in the Russian Federation at the federal Angarsk \r\nElectrolytic Chemical Plant. We are grateful to the \r\nIAEA for its favourable assessment of Russia’s \r\ninitiative, in particular as regards the establishment of \r\nthe international centre, which is open for participation \r\nby third-party States without any political conditions. \r\nAt present, procedures are being finalized for the \r\naccession of Armenia and Ukraine. In January 2008, \r\nthe IAEA was officially informed about the inclusion \r\nof the centre on the list of Russian nuclear fuel-cycle \r\nfacilities that can be covered by IAEA safeguards. \r\n Given the number of ideas that exist with regard \r\nto ensuring fuel supplies, it is clear that the time has \r\ncome to consider harmonized approaches to \r\nestablishing such guaranteed fuel supplies. The vision \r\nof what those principles should be was presented \r\nduring the fifty-second session of the IAEA General \r\nConference. We believe that it is necessary to build up \r\nthe capabilities of the Agency as the only international \r\nbody with the requisite authority to assess States’ \r\ncompliance with their obligations in the area of nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation.  \r\n One of the Agency’s effective instruments in that \r\nfield is the additional protocol to the safeguards \r\nagreement. In the future, the additional protocol stands \r\nto become a universal norm for verifying compliance \r\nby NPT States parties with their obligations and an \r\nessential new standard in the field of nuclear export \r\ncontrol. We intend to continue assisting the Agency in \r\nreinforcing the IAEA safeguards system, including \r\nthrough our national programme of scientific and \r\ntechnological support safeguards. \r\n Russia ratified its Additional Protocol in October \r\n2007. We hope that all the States that have not yet \r\nacceded to that important instrument — first and \r\nforemost, those engaged in significant nuclear \r\nactivities or possessing significant stockpiles of \r\nnuclear materials — will do so as rapidly as possible. \r\n Today, one of the most important factors in \r\nensuring the national security of an individual State \r\nand the international community as a whole is the \r\nability to respond in an adequate and timely manner to \r\nthe threat of nuclear terrorism. In that respect, we note \r\nthe valuable contribution of IAEA experts to the \r\nimplementation of the Global Initiative to Combat \r\nNuclear Terrorism. The Initiative significantly \r\nenhances and complements IAEA activities in the \r\nframework of the implementation of the Agency’s \r\nNuclear Security Plan for 2006-2009. We intend to \r\nfurther improve the parametres for our practical \r\ncooperation in that field, including in terms of resource \r\nsupport. \r\n We back the IAEA’s active cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and other \r\ninternational organizations and structures on the issue \r\nof countering the threat of nuclear terrorism. The \r\nRussian Federation has ratified the amendment to the \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterials. We call upon States that have not yet done \r\nso to promptly sign and ratify both the International \r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear \r\nTerrorism as well as the Convention on the Physical \r\nProtection of Nuclear Material and its amendment. \r\n One of the three pillars on which all IAEA \r\nactivity is based is ensuring nuclear and radiation \r\nsafety. We welcome the efforts of the Agency to assist \r\nStates in establishing and strengthening national \r\nregulatory systems in that field. We intend to continue \r\nto lend effective support to IAEA efforts to strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation in the field of nuclear and \r\nradiation safety, the safe transport of nuclear and \r\nradioactive materials, and the management of \r\nradioactive waste. \r\n We attach great importance to the implementation \r\nof technical cooperation projects related to the removal \r\nof highly enriched uranium from Soviet-designed \r\nresearch reactors. In 2007, the Russian Federation \r\nprovided technical assistance in the removal of fuel \r\nfrom Viet Nam, Poland and the Czech Republic. \r\n Russia intends to assist Ukraine in improving the \r\nsafety of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant site and \r\naccelerating the start of the facility’s decommissioning. \r\nWe will allocate $17 million for that purpose to the \r\nNuclear Safety Account and the Chernobyl Shelter \r\nFund. \r\n An important area of the Agency’s activities is \r\nthe implementation of the Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme. The Russian Federation has been and \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n19 08-56886 \r\n \r\nintends to continue to pay its voluntary contributions to \r\nthe IAEA Technical Cooperation Fund in full. We are \r\nin favour of preserving the current mechanism for \r\nfinancing the Technical Cooperation Fund on the basis \r\nof contributions paid by member States in national \r\ncurrencies, the amount of which is assessed under the \r\nUnited Nations scale in accordance with existing \r\npractice. \r\n The Russian Federation intends to assist the \r\nRepublic of Armenia in improving the safety of the \r\nArmenian nuclear power plant. We plan to provide that \r\nassistance within the framework of the IAEA Technical \r\nCooperation Programme and to allocate $10 million to \r\nthat end. \r\n I reaffirm our support for the draft resolution on \r\nthe IAEA report (A/63/L.6). As a sponsor of the draft, \r\nRussia attaches great importance to the work of the \r\nAgency and is confident that it will be continued in the \r\nfuture in the interests of strengthening international \r\nsecurity. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I wish \r\nto begin by welcoming the report (see A/63/276) \r\nintroduced by the Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its contents, \r\nreviewing the wide range of important and diverse \r\nactivities of the Agency in 2007. \r\n I also wish to confirm our absolute confidence in \r\nthe effective ability of the Agency to perform its task in \r\npromoting a balanced focus on the three main pillars of \r\nits activities: technology, safety and verification. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The year 2007 marked the completion of five \r\ndecades since the establishment of the IAEA, during \r\nwhich it contributed, inter alia, to the implementation \r\nof comprehensive safeguards regimes, the enhancement \r\nof nuclear safety and security standards, and increased \r\nuse of safe nuclear energy. Accordingly, in 2007, some \r\n439 nuclear reactors provided 15 per cent of the \r\nworld’s electricity, while dozens of others were either \r\nunder construction or in the planning phase. \r\n Egypt has supported the IAEA since its \r\nestablishment, convinced of its role in enhancing \r\ninternational peace and the peaceful use of nuclear \r\ntechnology in areas that serve the development \r\naspirations of developing countries and address \r\ninternational needs in a large array of fields. \r\n Since it was entrusted with the establishment and \r\nmanagement of comprehensive safeguards for \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States, the importance of the \r\nAgency’s role has grown even further. All States of the \r\nMiddle East have thus realized the central importance \r\nof acceding to the IAEA comprehensive safeguards \r\nregime, except for Israel, the only State that remains \r\noutside the regime, despite the adoption at the 2003 \r\nIAEA General Conference of a resolution entitled \r\n“Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East”, \r\ncalling upon Israel to join the IAEA comprehensive \r\nsafeguards regime in order to facilitate the \r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East and to enhance regional stability and \r\nconfidence-building. \r\n There is no doubt that the presence of nuclear \r\nfacilities not subject to the safeguards regime and not \r\ncomplying with international safety or security \r\nstandards in the Middle East is a matter that calls for \r\nan effective regional and international response, \r\nespecially since the absence of international oversight \r\nof such facilities threatens the security and stability of \r\nthe entire region. \r\n We appeal to countries that have not recognized \r\nthe importance of Arab calls for the IAEA to seriously \r\naddress Israel’s nuclear capabilities to reassess their \r\nunconstructive approach in preventing the \r\nconsideration of a draft resolution of such importance \r\nat the IAEA General Conference. That trend was \r\nconfirmed again at the 2008 session and will further \r\ncomplicate the crisis and increase nuclear threats in the \r\nMiddle East, and eventually weaken the role of the \r\nAgency itself. \r\n It is important to prove by practical means the \r\nsincerity of the support, often reiterated in our \r\nstatements to the General Assembly and its First \r\nCommittee, for the central role played by the IAEA in \r\nthe field of verification. Such practical means could \r\ninclude providing the Agency with the financial \r\nresources it needs and strengthening its legal authority \r\nthrough the universalization of the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards regime, thus allowing it to demand \r\nadditional commitments from States to strengthen its \r\nverification capabilities. \r\n At a time when developing countries’ need is \r\ngrowing for clean and inexpensive energy sources to \r\naddress their development plans and promote their \r\nsocio-economic situations, Egypt sees a crucial role for \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 20 \r\n \r\nthe Agency in widening the horizons of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and in effectively facilitating the \r\nsatisfaction by non-nuclear-weapon States signatories \r\nto the NPT of their growing nuclear energy needs. That \r\nshould proceed in a context that secures them the \r\ninalienable right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, \r\nas provided for in article IV of the NPT. \r\n The importance of the IAEA’s role has increased \r\neven further as the international community continues \r\nto witness qualitative and quantitative limitations on \r\nnuclear energy-related technology transfers from \r\ndeveloped to less developed countries. It is indeed \r\nregrettable that efforts continue to impose unjustified \r\nrestrictions on the acquisition by non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates of the necessary material and technology to \r\ndevelop their peaceful nuclear programmes, on the one \r\nhand, while on the other, current efforts are being made \r\nto facilitate the acquisition by non-NPT member States \r\nof nuclear technologies and materials exceeding those \r\nwhich have ever been granted to non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates. Egypt believes that such an approach \r\nsignificantly endangers the universality of the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards regime and undermines \r\nefforts to avoid politicizing it in a manner that \r\njeopardizes its validity and value and the feasibility of \r\nthe NPT itself. \r\n In that context and despite the fact that nuclear-\r\nweapon States have not fulfilled their nuclear \r\ndisarmament obligations under the NPT, the 1995 \r\npackage of the Review and Extension Conference and \r\nthe Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference, \r\nthose States and others that enjoy nuclear protection \r\nunder them are still working to impose additional \r\ncommitments on non-nuclear-weapon States in the \r\nform of additional safeguards. They are doing so while \r\nignoring the voluntary nature of any additional \r\ninternational commitment beyond the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards regime, as well as the logical inevitability \r\nof achieving the universality of the IAEA’s \r\ncomprehensive safeguards system prior to any attempt \r\nto change the system in a discriminatory manner. \r\n Through 2007 and up until now, the Agency has \r\ncontinued to consider the technical, legal and \r\noperational dimensions of a number of current \r\nproposals on nuclear fuel assurances based on a \r\nmultilateral approach to the nuclear fuel cycle. Egypt’s \r\nposition is in line with the statement made by the \r\nDirector General of IAEA in his June 2007 report to \r\nthe Board of Governors, to the effect that there is no \r\nbasis for assuming that multilateral approaches to the \r\nnuclear fuel cycle should in any way restrict free \r\nnational choices in that regard, in accordance with the \r\ninalienable right guaranteed by the NPT to \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States without restrictions to that \r\nright. \r\n Egypt reiterates its interest in supporting the \r\nactivities of the Agency in the area of technical \r\ncooperation with ourselves and other developing \r\ncountries that benefit from technical cooperation \r\nprogrammes for the use of nuclear technologies in the \r\nsectors of health, agriculture, food, water resources, \r\nradioactive isotopes and irradiation. In that context, we \r\nreiterate our belief in the importance of enhancing the \r\nrole of the Agency in the area of technology transfer by \r\nsecuring and increasing the financial resources \r\nallocated for technical cooperation activities, given that \r\nsuch activities represent a main pillar of the Agency’s \r\nkey area of activities under its statute. \r\n Taking into consideration the role of the Agency \r\nas the international multilateral forum in applying the \r\nhighest safety standards to nuclear energy reactors, \r\nEgypt, as a State seeking nuclear energy on its route to \r\ndevelopment, cooperates with the Agency in that \r\nregard. That cooperation includes assessing energy \r\nrequirements and technical advice with regard to the \r\nsafe and effective development of national capabilities \r\nin the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We look forward \r\nto the continued support of the Agency for our efforts \r\nin that area. \r\n Finally, I take this opportunity to express our \r\nparticular appreciation to the staff of the Agency and \r\nDirector General Mohamed ElBaradei for the \r\noutstanding and balanced role he has played in leading \r\nthe Agency since he assumed his post in 1997. I also \r\nwish to express our gratitude for the results achieved \r\nunder his responsible leadership in terms of developing \r\nthat most sensitive and important international body. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to reaffirm that Egypt will \r\ncontinue to support the Agency in all possible ways in \r\norder to preserve the value that the entire international \r\ncommunity attaches to its balanced role and to the \r\ncontribution that it makes to security, stability, \r\nscientific advancement and welfare. \r\n Mr. Chow (Singapore): Singapore joins other \r\nmembers of the General Assembly in thanking the \r\nDirector General and his dedicated staff for the \r\ncomprehensive report (see A/63/276) and their \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n21 08-56886 \r\n \r\nexcellent work. That is testimony to the leadership and \r\nskills of the Director General. We would like to \r\nreaffirm our full support for the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) as the global focal point for \r\nnuclear cooperation, in line with its three pillars of \r\ntechnology, safety and security and verification. \r\n The year 2007 marked the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nthe founding of the IAEA, which was a concrete \r\nexpression of the international community’s hopes for \r\nand aspirations to “atoms for peace”. After five \r\ndecades of important progress, the Agency’s activities \r\nremain vital in advancing the peaceful applications of \r\nnuclear science and technology for economic and \r\nsocial development. In that context, Singapore \r\nwelcomes the Agency’s initiative to reflect on the \r\nchallenges and opportunities that it will face in the \r\nyears to come. The recent work of the Commission of \r\nEminent Persons on the future of the Agency \r\nconstitutes a timely exercise to review how the three \r\npillars of nuclear safety, nuclear technology and \r\nnuclear verification can be strengthened. To that end, \r\nSingapore extends its full support to the Agency and \r\nstands ready to work with all stakeholders. \r\n At a time when nuclear energy is becoming \r\nincreasingly attractive as an alternative source of \r\nenergy for a growing number of countries, the IAEA’s \r\nprimary role of ensuring the peaceful, safe and secure \r\nuse of nuclear energy has gained renewed importance. \r\nAt the end of 2007, a total of 34 nuclear power plants \r\nwere under construction around the world. I understand \r\nfrom the Director General’s recent statement that that \r\nnumber has increased to 36. The increased interest in \r\nthe use of nuclear power is notably centred in Asia, \r\ncorresponding to the region’s rapid economic growth \r\nand accompanying rise in energy demand. \r\n Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, States have the sovereign right to \r\ndevelop nuclear energy for peaceful means. At the \r\nsame time, there is also a grave responsibility to \r\ncarefully consider safety and security issues that arise \r\nfrom the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The \r\nChernobyl tragedy is a solemn reminder of the \r\nprofound and long-term detrimental consequences \r\nresulting from a serious nuclear power plant accident. \r\nThe impact on the affected people and the surrounding \r\neconomies continues to be felt today. We should heed \r\nthat lesson because the world can ill afford a repeat of \r\nChernobyl. \r\n Unfortunately, despite advancements in science \r\nand technology and the introduction of earthquake-\r\nproof designs for today’s nuclear power plants, \r\naccidents can still happen. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa \r\nnuclear power plant and the earthquake of 16 July 2007 \r\nprovide a stark reminder of how accidents can occur. \r\nFortunately, the nuclear power plant was designed to \r\nwithstand shocks above its recommended seismic \r\nthreshold. That helped to avert a potentially serious \r\nnuclear disaster. In that case, Japan’s responsible \r\napproach to design safety was commendable.  \r\n However, we can never afford to be complacent, \r\nespecially when more States are considering \r\ndeveloping nuclear energy as an alternative source of \r\nenergy. States undertaking such nuclear options should \r\nnot neglect or compromise the safety of their people \r\nand the neighbouring region. Plant designs and site \r\nlocations in particular should be carefully considered. \r\nFor example, locating nuclear reactors within \r\nearthquake zones or active volcanic areas can be \r\npotentially deadly. The effects of a nuclear accident are \r\ntransboundary and can affect the region at large. It is \r\ntherefore imperative that regional safety concerns also \r\nbe taken into serious consideration when new nuclear \r\npower plants are planned and built. \r\n At the twelfth summit of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), held in Cebu, the \r\nPhilippines, ASEAN leaders, acknowledging that the \r\nregion needed to explore alternative sources of energy, \r\ntasked officials to look into a regional nuclear safety \r\nregime. The leaders again reaffirmed their decision to \r\nforge ASEAN-wide cooperation to establish a regional \r\nnuclear safety regime by signing the ASEAN \r\nDeclaration on Environmental Sustainability at the \r\nthirteenth ASEAN summit.  \r\n We believe that the IAEA can play an \r\ninstrumental role in helping our region to adopt a set of \r\ncommon norms and best practices that are in line with \r\ninternational standards for the design of nuclear power \r\nplants and nuclear technology management and \r\ndevelopment. Regional safety and security regimes \r\nunder the IAEA auspices can be critical in helping \r\nStates to develop capacity based on the IAEA’s safety \r\nprotocols and standards. Singapore will continue to \r\nwork closely with the IAEA and regional partners to \r\ndevelop and promote a regional framework of \r\ncollaboration and cooperation, as well as to adopt the \r\nbest practices in that field. In that way, the region can \r\ntake a constructive and responsible step forward in \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 22 \r\n \r\nfostering a culture of safety among nuclear regulators \r\nand operators. \r\n Looking ahead, we believe that it is also timely to \r\nexamine the future role of the IAEA. A number of \r\nimportant recommendations made by the Commission \r\nof Eminent Persons are worth considering. They \r\ninclude the further harmonization of regional nuclear \r\nstandards, a move on the part of countries from \r\nvoluntary to mandatory international peer reviews, and \r\ncompulsory inspections to assess compliance with \r\nnuclear standards in order to help increase safety \r\nworldwide and enhance public confidence. \r\n In conclusion, Singapore would like to express its \r\ncontinued support for the important work of the IAEA \r\nin the areas of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, \r\nsafety and security, and verification. We strongly urge \r\nall States — especially those with outstanding \r\nobligations and issues — to cooperate fully with the \r\nIAEA to further strengthen cooperation and \r\nconfidence-building as part of the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to enhance global peace and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): On behalf of the \r\nIndonesian delegation, I would like first to express our \r\nappreciation to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), for his presentation of the 2007 annual report \r\nof the IAEA (see A/63/276). His tenure has come at a \r\ntime of complex global challenges. Our gratitude goes \r\nto him for his long years of excellent service and \r\nsteadfast efforts, which have seen the Agency grapple \r\nwith those challenges in an effective manner while \r\npreparing to meet future ones. \r\n Among the greatest achievements of the IAEA \r\nare its contributions in advancing human progress in \r\nnuclear applications, promoting socio-economic \r\ndevelopment and maintaining world peace and security. \r\nWe would therefore like to express our sincere \r\nappreciation for the role that the Agency has long \r\nplayed in promoting nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes under the three pillars of its mandate. \r\n Indonesia attaches great importance to technical \r\ncooperation with the Agency, which contributes \r\nsignificantly to development in Member States. But it \r\nis our obligation to ensure that the IAEA has sufficient, \r\nguaranteed and predictable resources for its activities. \r\nFor its part, Indonesia has been supportive of technical \r\ncooperation activities and has consistently paid its \r\nannual share of the targets of the Technical \r\nCooperation Fund. For the Fund’s 2009 target, \r\nIndonesia has pledged the amount of $100,000. \r\n In our view, the current funding system for the \r\nFund, which relies on voluntary contributions, is \r\nneither fair nor capable of meeting the essential needs \r\nof Member States, especially developing countries. In \r\norder to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of its \r\ntechnical cooperation, the IAEA should pursue a more \r\nbalanced distribution of its budget in order to reflect \r\nthe equal importance of the Agency’s three pillars, \r\nthereby maintaining a balance among its various \r\nstatutory activities. \r\n It remains imperative to strengthen the \r\neffectiveness of the Agency — including its \r\nperformance in technical cooperation activities — so \r\nthat it can face the challenges of changing \r\ncircumstances and the diverse needs of Member States. \r\nIn that regard, we value the Director General’s \r\ninitiative to establish the Commission of Eminent \r\nPersons to reflect upon the nature and scope of the \r\nAgency’s programme until 2020 and beyond. We share \r\nthe hope that the report will trigger discussions among \r\nMember States so that its recommendations will \r\ncontribute to the achievement of development goals \r\nand will enhance the Agency’s credibility and \r\neffectiveness.  \r\n Indonesia has long been a strong supporter of \r\npromoting nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and \r\nthe IAEA has a large and active technical cooperation \r\nprogramme in my country. Indonesia greatly \r\ncommends the Agency’s work in areas of vital \r\nimportance, such as food and agriculture, including its \r\nwork to enhance the capacity of Member States to \r\nensure sustainable food security and productivity \r\nthrough the application of nuclear techniques. The \r\nreinvigoration of agriculture and support for research \r\non a variety of technologies, including better-adapted \r\ncrop varieties and agriculture techniques, are key. It is \r\nwithin the Agency’s mandate to contribute strongly to \r\nthose global efforts to alleviate food shortages by \r\nhelping to implement all technological and scientific \r\nresources available within its capacity.  \r\n Bearing in mind that the major health issues of \r\nour time, such as cancer, require concerted \r\ninternational cooperation, we also support the IAEA’s \r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy. The \r\nProgramme has played a growing role in international \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n23 08-56886 \r\n \r\nefforts against cancer in the developing world. \r\nIndonesia is interested in benefiting from the \r\ncooperation with the IAEA in that important \r\nProgramme. \r\n It is positive to note that the IAEA has increased \r\ninternational awareness about the future role of nuclear \r\nenergy in tackling the grave challenge of climate \r\nchange. We are pleased that the Nuclear Technology \r\nReview 2008 highlighted the results of the thirteenth \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nheld in Bali, Indonesia, last December, which charted \r\nthe way for what will, we hope, be an effective \r\npost-2012 Kyoto agreement on climate change. The \r\nReview rightly indicated that the Conference had \r\nmarked a step forward in managing risks related to \r\nglobal climate change. \r\n We commend the work of the International \r\nProject on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel \r\nCycles (INPRO). Indonesia, as a member of INPRO, \r\ncontinues to support its activities to meet global energy \r\ndemands and to promote sustainable economic and \r\nsocial development.  \r\n As part of the efforts to strengthen the \r\ninternational nuclear safety regime, we have \r\nparticipated actively in the Asian Nuclear Safety \r\nNetwork (ANSN). It has played an important role in \r\npromoting nuclear safety networks and contributes to \r\nthe nuclear safety activities of Asian countries. We \r\nencourage other countries in Asia to join ANSN, which \r\nis the sole network for promoting nuclear safety in the \r\nregion. We encourage the Agency to continue its \r\nsupport for the regional nuclear safety activities carried \r\nout within the framework of ANSN. \r\n Indonesia, as an archipelagic State, continues to \r\nsupport the efforts of the IAEA to strengthen \r\ncooperation and coordination, to address the potential \r\nfor accidents or incidents during the transportation of \r\nspent fuel and high-level nuclear waste and radioactive \r\nmaterials by sea, and to thwart possible dangers to \r\nhuman health in and the environment of the transit \r\ncountries. We share the view that the expansion of \r\nnuclear power will create opportunities as well as \r\nchallenges and that we need to find a solution with \r\nregard to spent-fuel management and waste disposal in \r\norder to ensure the sustainable development of nuclear \r\nenergy. \r\n Nevertheless, it is important that the measures to \r\nstrengthen nuclear security not hamper international \r\ncooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, \r\nthe exchange of nuclear material for peaceful purposes \r\nand the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\n Indonesia continues to support the Agency’s work \r\nto strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nsafeguards system. The safeguards system is both a \r\nfundamental part of the global nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime and an essential element in \r\nthe pursuit of nuclear disarmament. My delegation is \r\npleased to state that as a party to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to \r\nthe Treaty on the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-\r\nFree Zone, Indonesia has put a comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreement and an additional protocol into \r\nforce, and has implemented integrated safeguards in \r\ncollaboration with the Agency. However, we share the \r\nconcern that progress on the universalization of \r\nsafeguards agreements and additional protocols has \r\nbeen slower than expected. The universalization should \r\nbe applied equally, to both non-nuclear and nuclear-\r\nweapon States. \r\n Indonesia attaches great importance to the NPT \r\nand hopes that, in the future, the parties will be able to \r\nformulate a consensual text that could be recommended \r\nfor adoption at the 2010 Review Conference. At the \r\nConference, all countries should renew their \r\ncommitment to nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation and intensify their efforts to realize \r\nthe three pillars of the NPT in a balanced, \r\ncomprehensive and non-discriminatory manner. The \r\nAgency should prepare, and should be ready to respond \r\nto the technical needs of verification for future nuclear \r\ndisarmament. Since nuclear non-proliferation and \r\nnuclear disarmament are mutually reinforcing, the \r\nAgency should not cover only verification in the \r\ncontext of both fulfilment of non-proliferation \r\ncommitments. \r\n We are of the view that the creation of a \r\nmultilateral fuel cycle arrangement that would, inter \r\nalia, guarantee the security of the nuclear fuel supply, \r\nwould provide a complementary mechanism for \r\nstrengthening the existing non-proliferation regime and \r\nshould be discussed in a non-discriminatory and \r\ninclusive manner. The objectives and modalities to \r\nestablish such arrangements should not terminate or \r\nrestrict the right of each State to develop nuclear \r\ntechnology. \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 24 \r\n \r\n For a long time now, the General Conference of \r\nthe IAEA has devoted attention to the situation in the \r\nMiddle East. Sadly, however, there has been no \r\nprogress in the efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zone in the Middle East. We are concerned by that \r\nsituation, and we stress the demand that Israel place all \r\nits nuclear installations under Agency safeguards and \r\naccede to the NPT, as it has already been called upon \r\nto do by a number of resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly and the General Conference of the IAEA.  \r\n Indonesia appreciates the overall contribution of \r\nthe IAEA, despite the difficulties, in making progress \r\nin the implementation of safeguards agreements in \r\nsome countries.  \r\n To conclude, my delegation would like to stress \r\nthat Indonesia is deeply committed to the cause of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes and fully supports \r\nthe work of the IAEA. Challenges that confront us \r\nshould be met through concerted and concrete actions \r\nin which all Member States, working together, must \r\nbear their responsibility. Strengthening the Agency is a \r\nshared interest and a commitment for all States \r\nmembers of the Agency. We believe that further \r\nconstructive debate among the member States is \r\nimperative to ensure that demands, concerns and \r\npriorities, particularly those of the developing \r\ncountries, are duly addressed. \r\n Mr. Tarar (Pakistan): The delegation of Pakistan \r\nwould like to begin by expressing its appreciation for \r\nthe annual report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) (see A/63/276) and the efforts made by \r\nthe Agency and its Director General, Mr. Mohamed \r\nElBaradei, in that regard. \r\n The IAEA’s role as the world’s focal point in \r\npromoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy assumes \r\ngreater significance in view of the fast-growing global \r\ndemand for energy and the shortage of fossil fuel \r\nreserves, as well as the diverse challenges of \r\nenvironmental impacts and proliferation. The IAEA \r\ncan make a significant contribution in meeting the \r\nneeds and challenges of the twenty-first century by \r\nensuring equitable access to nuclear materials, \r\ntechnology and equipment for peaceful purposes. \r\n In order to ensure the realization of every State’s \r\nright to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, there is a \r\nneed to develop universal and non-discriminatory \r\ncriteria for international cooperation in the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy, including nuclear power \r\ngeneration. In this regard, principles should be placed \r\nabove expediency and commercial interests. A \r\nnon-discriminatory approach in the promotion of \r\ncivilian nuclear cooperation would help reinforce \r\nconfidence and credibility in the IAEA safeguards \r\nsystem and strengthen the non-proliferation regime. \r\n In the context of peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nit would be pertinent to recall the words of United \r\nStates President Eisenhower, who in his “Atoms for \r\nPeace” address to the General Assembly at its \r\n470th plenary meeting, in 1953, stated the following: \r\n “It is not enough to take this weapon out of the \r\nhands of the soldiers. It must be put into the \r\nhands of those who will know how to strip its \r\nmilitary casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.” \r\n It is imperative to place the “Atoms for Peace” \r\nparadigm, the founding spirit of the IAEA, at the centre \r\nof any future vision for the Agency. That can only be \r\nensured through maintaining balance between the \r\npromotional activities of the Agency and its work in \r\nthe areas of verification, nuclear safety and security. \r\nWe should not lose sight of the fact that the IAEA’s \r\nstatutory mandate in the areas of verification, safety \r\nand security is aimed at facilitating the pursuit of the \r\nprimary objective of the Agency, namely the promotion \r\nof peaceful uses of atomic energy. \r\n It is essential that the IAEA, as one of the most \r\nefficient technical organizations in the United Nations \r\nsystem, maintain focus on its technical promotional \r\ncharacter. The promotional activities of the Agency are \r\nbest reflected in its Technical Cooperation Programme. \r\nThis dynamic process of technical assistance has \r\nbrought about tangible benefits to developing member \r\nStates. \r\n Pakistan has been one of the major beneficiaries \r\nof the Agency’s Technical Cooperation Programme. \r\nThe Agency has made a valuable contribution to the \r\ndevelopment of our peaceful nuclear programme. We \r\nwould like to express our deep appreciation to the \r\nDepartment of Technical Cooperation for achieving a \r\nhigh rate of implementation, and for its excellent \r\nprogramme delivery. \r\n For our part, we have made — and remain \r\nprepared to continue to make in the future — our \r\ncontribution towards the Agency’s promotional \r\nactivities, by sharing our experience, offering training \r\nplacements and providing the services of experts. As \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n25 08-56886 \r\n \r\none of the Agency’s earliest member States, Pakistan \r\nhas long been a strong advocate of promoting and \r\nharnessing nuclear technology for peace, progress and \r\nprosperity for all.  \r\n Pakistan has developed the entire range of \r\nnuclear fuel cycle facilities. We now have two nuclear \r\npower plants in operation, while a third is under \r\nconstruction. We have plans to establish a uranium \r\nconversion and enrichment facility to cater for the \r\nneeds of our nuclear power plants. As announced \r\nalready, Pakistan intends to place that facility under \r\nIAEA safeguards. We look forward to the IAEA’s \r\nassistance in the completion of our nuclear power \r\ngeneration plan, including assistance in exploration and \r\nprospecting for uranium in the country, so that this \r\nclean source of power production is exploited to the \r\nmaximum possible extent in the place of reliance on \r\nfossil fuels. \r\n Parallel to the development of the nuclear fuel \r\ncycle, an extensive programme for the application of \r\nnuclear technology and radioisotopes in agriculture, \r\nhydrology and the medical and industrial sectors is also \r\nunder way in Pakistan. \r\n Since the foundation of its atomic energy \r\ndevelopment programme, Pakistan has always \r\nrecognized that nuclear safety and security in both \r\nnational and international contexts is a vital objective. \r\nAlthough the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority \r\n(PNRA) was established as an independent body in \r\n2001, the genesis of the physical protection of nuclear \r\nfacilities and security of nuclear and radioactive \r\nmaterials goes back decades to when safety and \r\nsecurity were internally managed by the Pakistan \r\nAtomic Energy Commission.  \r\n In the area of nuclear security, Pakistan has \r\nalways strived to follow the existing international \r\nstandards. The IAEA document INFCIRC/225, entitled \r\n“The Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and \r\nNuclear Facilities”, though a voluntary guidance for \r\nmember States, has been used as a basis for inspection \r\nand enforcement in Pakistan. We are also following the \r\nguidance contained in the IAEA Code of Conduct on \r\nthe Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and are \r\nparticipating in the IAEA’s Illicit Trafficking Database. \r\n The law establishing the Pakistan Nuclear \r\nRegulatory Authority (PNRA) mandates that body to \r\nensure that appropriate measures for the physical \r\nprotection of nuclear installations and nuclear materials \r\nare taken by all licensees. It also requires the Authority \r\nto ensure enforcement of regulations prohibiting \r\nunauthorized access to, possession of or use of nuclear \r\nand radioactive material and facilities containing such \r\nmaterials. \r\n Since its establishment, the Authority has adopted \r\na body of regulations and upgraded those that already \r\nexisted to bring them into line with international \r\nstandards on nuclear safety and security.  \r\n Since June 2006, the Authority has been \r\nimplementing the national nuclear security action plan \r\nin Pakistan. The Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority \r\nhas used IAEA safety standards as the basis for \r\nnational regulations to regulate nuclear installations \r\nand facilities. The Authority has established fruitful \r\ncooperation with the Agency and we deeply appreciate \r\nvaluable assistance received from the Agency in the \r\nareas of nuclear safety and security. However, we urge \r\nthe Agency to work out ways and means to facilitate \r\ntransfers of safety-related technology. We also urge \r\nStates with advanced nuclear technology to move \r\nbeyond emphasizing the significance of nuclear safety \r\nand security and to take steps to remove unjustified \r\nrestrictions on transfers of related technology and \r\nequipment in order to promote the objective of nuclear \r\nsafety and security worldwide. \r\n I would like to conclude by placing on record \r\nPakistan’s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. \r\nOur track record on IAEA safeguards has been \r\nimmaculate and we have always fulfilled our \r\nobligations. We have effective controls in place on the \r\nexport of goods, technologies and facilities related to \r\nnuclear weapons and their delivery systems. These \r\ncontrols meet existing international standards. On the \r\nbasis of our moral and political commitment to its \r\nobjectives, we believe that the global non-proliferation \r\nregime must be strengthened by the application of its \r\nnorms in a non-selective, non-discriminatory and \r\nequitable manner. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): At the outset, let \r\nme thank International Atomic Energy Agency Director \r\nGeneral Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei for his \r\ncomprehensive report and his statement on the recent \r\nmajor developments regarding the activities of the \r\nAgency. \r\n We welcome the outcome of the fifty-second \r\nGeneral Conference of the Agency held in Vienna \r\nbetween 29 September and 4 October 2008, including \r\nA/63/PV.31  \r\n \r\n08-56886 26 \r\n \r\nthe approval of the Sultanate of Oman, Kingdom of \r\nLesotho and Papua New Guinea for membership of the \r\nAgency. We also welcome States that became members \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in \r\n2007, namely, Bahrain, Burundi, Cape Verde, Congo \r\nand Nepal. \r\n The IAEA annual report for 2007, which marks \r\n50 years of the Agency’s indispensable and outstanding \r\nwork, indicates that the Agency is continuing to \r\ndevelop its activities in many areas of nuclear \r\ntechnology of great interest and importance to the \r\nhuman community. We wholeheartedly support the \r\nneed for the Agency to expand technical cooperation in \r\nthe application of nuclear technology in the areas of \r\nfood, agriculture, medicine and natural resources.  \r\n Today, we are going to adopt the annual draft \r\nresolution reaffirming the strong support of the General \r\nAssembly for the indispensable role of the IAEA in \r\n“encouraging and assisting the development and \r\npractical application of atomic energy for peaceful \r\nuses, in technology transfer to developing countries \r\nand in nuclear safety, verification and security” \r\n(A/63/L.6, para. 3). Indeed, the role and goals of the \r\nAgency, which serves as one of the main instruments \r\nof the nuclear-weapon non-proliferation regime, cannot \r\nbe overestimated. Unfortunately, the conflicts and \r\nthreats in that area have not diminished.  \r\n The international community had failed to resolve \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation issues owing to the \r\nabsence of consensus. The IAEA should play a leading \r\nrole under the three pillars of its mandate to monitor \r\nthe technology, safety and verification of nuclear use \r\namong nations. We support the strengthening of the \r\nAgency’s function as a non-proliferation watchdog, \r\nverifying the production, possession, use and import \r\nand export of all nuclear material. \r\n As a member of the Agency, Kazakhstan is \r\nundertaking effective measures to implement of its \r\nobligations to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, \r\nincluding the Additional Protocol to the Agreement on \r\nthe Application of Safeguards between Kazakhstan and \r\nthe IAEA. We are interested in deepening cooperation \r\nwith the Agency to meet our intention to increase \r\nuranium production under strict IAEA control. \r\n As the IAEA report indicates, continuing \r\npopulation growth and longer human lifespan are \r\ncreating challenges for energy supply. The ongoing \r\ncrises and disruption in energy security create a \r\ngrowing demand for nuclear energy. The latest IAEA \r\nprojections estimate that global energy consumption \r\nwill grow by 53 per cent by 2030, with 70 per cent of \r\nthe growth coming from developing countries, where \r\n17 of the 29 nuclear reactors currently under \r\nconstruction are located. \r\n Kazakhstan possesses approximately 19 per cent \r\nof the world’s explored uranium reserves, which is \r\naround 1.5 million tons. In 2007 uranium production in \r\nKazakhstan was 6,637 tons; compared with the \r\n5,281 tons produced in 2006, this represents a growth \r\nrate of 25.7 per cent. In 2008, we plan to produce \r\napproximately 9,600 tons of uranium. In that \r\nperspective, we plan to bring annual production of \r\nnatural uranium to more than 15,000 tons by 2010, \r\nmaking Kazakhstan the world’s leading uranium \r\nproducer. \r\n Taking those facts into account, the Government \r\nof Kazakhstan adopted a national programme of atomic \r\nenergy development, which envisions the \r\nintensification of cooperation with the IAEA and its \r\nmember States. With the expansion of nuclear activities \r\nin Kazakhstan, the Government is planning to create a \r\nspecial authority to coordinate national programmes \r\nfor the peaceful use of atomic energy. \r\n Kazakhstan is actively implementing the new \r\nedition of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and \r\nSecurity of Radioactive Sources. Projects for \r\nstrengthening controls on ionizing radiation sources \r\nand on safe and secure management of strong sources \r\nare being successfully implemented. Instruments have \r\nbeen prepared to introduce the national register of \r\nsources of ionizing radiation and an inventory of \r\nradioactive sources on Kazakhstan’s territory is being \r\ncarried out. In implementing these and other similar \r\nprogrammes, we are thankful for the support and \r\neffective assistance of the IAEA and countries taking \r\npart in the projects. \r\n During the IAEA General Conference in Vienna \r\nthis year, we organized an exhibition on Kazakhstan’s \r\nrenunciation of nuclear weapons, the seventeenth \r\nanniversary of the closing of the Semipalatinsk nuclear \r\ntest site and the role of our country in strengthening the \r\nnon-proliferation and nuclear material control regimes. \r\nThat event also reflected Kazakhstan’s nuclear-fuel-\r\ncycle capacity through the examples of the work being \r\ndone at the Ulbinsk plant and at the research reactors \r\nof the National Nuclear Centre, as well as our \r\n A/63/PV.31\r\n \r\n27 08-56886 \r\n \r\ncooperation with foreign companies in the production \r\nof innovative and export-oriented materials. \r\n From 18 to 22 May 2009, Kazakhstan will host \r\nthe IAEA International Conference on Remediation of \r\nLand Contaminated by Radioactive Material/Residues. \r\nWe also welcome the IAEA’s readiness to work \r\ntogether with its partners in drafting a study, \r\nKazakhstan: a Country Profile on Sustainable Energy \r\nDevelopment. \r\n With the support of our Government, the joint \r\nstock company Nuclear Technology Park has \r\ncommenced operations in Kurchatov. It is expected to \r\nlay the groundwork for the development of \r\napplications for the peaceful uses of atomic energy, \r\nincluding nuclear power. Last year, a heavy-ion \r\naccelerator was launched at Astana, and the \r\nconstruction of the Kazakhstan tokamak for materials \r\ntesting is currently under way in Kurchatov; the project \r\nis moving towards the fabrication and installation of \r\nbasic equipment. A nuclear-medicine centre is being \r\nplanned in Almaty, and its construction is also \r\nsupported by the Government. \r\n We welcome the conclusion, set out in the report \r\nunder consideration, that in 2007 the nuclear industry \r\ncontinued to demonstrate a high level of safety and \r\nsecurity around the world. Kazakhstan, while \r\ncontinuing to combat the nuclear threat, recognizes the \r\nright of any nation to develop nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful purposes under strict international controls, in \r\nparticular those of the IAEA. The Agency’s \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreements and additional \r\nprotocols constitute its current verification standards. \r\nWe call on States that have not yet brought into force \r\ntheir IAEA safeguards agreements or additional \r\nprotocols to do so in an expeditious manner. \r\n We must find ways to resolve the conflict \r\nsituations that have recently arisen. Such means should \r\nnot infringe on the right of countries to technological \r\ndevelopment or hamper their access to knowledge and \r\nshould restore the confidence of the international \r\ncommunity with regard to peaceful nuclear activities.  \r\n Kazakhstan is taking measures to strengthen \r\nborder radiation monitoring and to further upgrade its \r\nsystem for combating the illicit trafficking of nuclear  \r\nand other radioactive materials. We have joined the \r\nGlobal Nuclear Energy Partnership initiative and \r\nsigned a Statement of Principles during the second \r\nministerial meeting of the Partnership, held on \r\n16 September 2007 in Vienna. Our country fully agrees \r\nwith the main principles of the Global Partnership and \r\nits vision of nuclear energy cooperation aimed at the \r\nsafe and secure expansion of civilian nuclear energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes. We believe that the Partnership \r\nprovides new momentum for the development of \r\nnational nuclear and energy industries.  \r\n Kazakhstan fully complies with all commonly \r\naccepted norms in its export control policy. As a \r\nmember of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, our country is \r\ntaking effective measures to meet its obligation to \r\nstrengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime. A \r\nsystem for combating illicit nuclear trafficking has \r\nbeen established and is being improved on a day-to-day \r\nbasis. At the same time, we call for thorough scrutiny \r\nof any new restrictions on the transfer of nuclear \r\ntechnologies, with a view to avoiding unjustified \r\nbarriers to peaceful atomic development. \r\n Mindful of the potential threat posed by highly \r\nenriched materials, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral \r\nResources of Kazakhstan has adopted a five-year \r\nprogramme to convert the VVR-K research reactor to \r\nlow-enriched fuel. The safe decommissioning of the \r\nBN-350 fast breeder reactor in Aktau is also in \r\nprogress.  \r\n In conclusion, I should like to reaffirm \r\nKazakhstan’s full support for the activities of the IAEA \r\nin accordance with article II of the Agency’s statute, \r\nwhich states, “The Agency shall seek to accelerate and \r\nenlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity throughout the world”. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I wish to inform members \r\nthat the consideration of agenda item 104 (a), “Election \r\nof twenty members of the Committee for Programme \r\nand Coordination”, scheduled for today, Monday, \r\n27 October 2008, has been postponed to a later date to \r\nbe announced. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n"
