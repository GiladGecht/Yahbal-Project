(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Nsengimana \r\n(Rwanda), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 80 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/276) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/63/L.6) \r\n \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): I join others in thanking \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his \r\npresentation to the General Assembly of the annual \r\nreport of the Agency for 2007. It was a year of notable \r\nsuccess for the Agency in its efforts to ensure that the \r\nbenefits of nuclear technology were shared globally for \r\neconomic and social development. \r\n My delegation shares the concern of the IAEA \r\nthat the Agency’s Technical Cooperation Fund \r\ncontinues to lag behind the pressing needs of \r\ndeveloping countries. In this regard, my delegation \r\nreiterates the need for the IAEA to ensure an equitable \r\nbalance between the three pillars of its mandate: \r\nnuclear applications, particularly through technical \r\ncooperation; nuclear safety and security; and nuclear \r\nverification. This is especially important with the \r\nemerging convergence of a global nuclear energy \r\nrenaissance with the need to ensure the efficient use of \r\nnuclear power while also addressing nuclear safety, \r\nsecurity and the verification of nuclear weapons \r\nnon-proliferation safeguards by the IAEA. \r\n The emerging global food crisis requires the \r\nattention of the IAEA in collaboration with the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \r\n(FAO). In view of the proven benefits of nuclear \r\ntechnology applications in food production and \r\nagriculture, my delegation supports the continued \r\noperation of the FAO-IAEA Joint Division and looks \r\nforward to progress in dealing with the crisis with the \r\nassistance of these important international \r\norganizations. \r\n It is in that spirit that my delegation looks forward \r\nto the new three-year IAEA Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme cycle, which puts emphasis on food and \r\nagriculture, human health, natural resources and nuclear \r\npower, in line with growing demand for technical \r\ncooperation for both peaceful non-power and power \r\napplications of nuclear technology from developing \r\nmember States. Towards this end, resources for the \r\nmanagement of technical cooperation for development \r\nunder IAEA Major Programme 6 must be increased. \r\n With regard to the call for the establishment of \r\nappropriate mechanisms to ensure that the resources \r\nfor the Fund are sufficient, assured and predictable, \r\nMalaysia supports the idea of changing the status of \r\ncontributions to the Fund from voluntary to more \r\nobligatory for all IAEA member States. Nevertheless, \r\nMalaysia fully supports the call to employ hedging \r\nmechanisms to protect against the erosion of the \r\nFund’s value owing to currency fluctuations. We also \r\nA/63/PV.32  \r\n \r\n08-57118 2 \r\n \r\nsupport the establishment of appropriate criteria for \r\nsetting Fund targets in order to avoid the unfavourable \r\nexperience that recipient member States currently have \r\nto go through in negotiating Fund targets. In order to \r\nencourage more recipient States to provide \r\nextrabudgetary contributions to the IAEA in line with \r\nthe concept of shared responsibility — such as those \r\nmade to projects under the Regional Cooperation \r\nAgreement for Research, Development and Training \r\nrelated to Nuclear Science and Technology in Asia and \r\nthe Pacific — Malaysia calls on the IAEA to exempt \r\nsuch contributions from programme support costs. \r\n For its part, Malaysia has consistently honoured \r\nits obligations to contribute on time and in full to both \r\nthe regular budget and Fund of the Agency, in addition \r\nto making extrabudgetary contributions for the \r\nRegional Cooperation Agreement. As a member State \r\nthat has benefited from the Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme, Malaysia has also, in return, supported the \r\nProgramme and other IAEA activities through in kind \r\ncontributions, by providing experts and fellowship \r\ntraining opportunities to other member States and by \r\nhosting various Agency activities. \r\n In this regard, my delegation wishes to thank the \r\nIAEA and to put on record our appreciation of the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Department’s continuing \r\nsupport for the implementation of IAEA technical \r\ncooperation projects and various other activities in \r\nMalaysia, including the trust shown to Malaysia in \r\nallowing it to continue hosting the IAEA Postgraduate \r\nEducational Course in Radiation Protection and the \r\nSafety of Radiation Sources. My delegation also wishes \r\nto express our gratitude to other member States that \r\nhave shown interest in the course, which has attracted \r\ncandidates from not only within our region but beyond. \r\n With regard to the application of full-scope \r\nsafeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East, \r\nMalaysia regrets that there has been no progress on \r\nconsultations on the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in that region. In this regard, \r\nMalaysia wishes to reiterate the need for a prompt \r\nestablishment of such a zone, as recognized in relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. Malaysia views with \r\nserious concern the fact that certain nuclear facilities \r\nand materials in the Middle East are not subject to \r\nIAEA comprehensive safeguards. Thus Malaysia calls \r\non Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), to refrain from engaging in \r\nnuclear military activities and to unconditionally open \r\nall its nuclear facilities and activities to IAEA \r\ninspections and safeguards in order to clarify the extent \r\nof its past and present nuclear activities. Only then \r\ncould the goal of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone in the Middle East be achieved. \r\n My delegation firmly believes that the future of \r\nthe IAEA should be based on the fundamental bargain \r\nunderlying the NPT, in particular, the inalienable right \r\nof all the States parties to the Treaty to develop, \r\nresearch, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes without discrimination and in conformity \r\nwith articles I, II and III of the NPT. That approach \r\nshould encompass the need to respect the choice and \r\ndecision of each country with regard to the range of \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy that they wish to \r\nundertake without jeopardizing their respective \r\nnational policies or international cooperation \r\nagreements and arrangements for peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy and its fuel cycle. \r\n Another fundamental principle is for developed \r\nMember States to promote the satisfaction of the \r\nlegitimate needs for nuclear energy of developing \r\ncountries by allowing them to participate to the fullest \r\nextent possible in the transfer of nuclear equipment, \r\nmaterials and scientific and technological information \r\nfor peaceful purposes with a view to achieving the \r\ngreatest possible benefit, and by applying relevant \r\naspects of sustainable development to their activities. \r\n On the issue of nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, Malaysia firmly believes that any \r\nconcern that any party may have on such matters can be \r\nbest addressed through multilaterally negotiated, \r\nuniversal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory \r\nagreements. Malaysia also firmly believes in the need \r\nfor nuclear weapon non-proliferation control \r\narrangements to be transparent and open to participation \r\nby all States, and to ensure that they do not impose \r\nrestrictions on access to the material, equipment and \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes required by \r\ndeveloping countries for their continued development. \r\n It is also a matter of extreme importance that the \r\nIAEA secretariat be allowed to maintain and enhance \r\nits impartiality and professionalism, particularly in \r\ncarrying out its safeguards verification activities. \r\nMalaysia strongly rejects any attempt by any party to \r\npoliticize the work of the IAEA, including its \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme, as that is \r\ntantamount to a violation of the statute of the IAEA. \r\n A/63/PV.32\r\n \r\n3 08-57118 \r\n \r\n In parallel, there is also a need for nuclear-\r\nweapon States and all States that are not parties to the \r\nNPT to exercise greater political will in favour of \r\ngeneral, complete and irreversible nuclear \r\ndisarmament, as called for under the Treaty. \r\n At the operational level, Malaysia firmly believes \r\nin the need for the IAEA to sustain a proper balance of \r\nemphasis between the three pillars of its mandate on \r\npeaceful applications of nuclear technology, including \r\ntechnical cooperation, nuclear safety and security, and \r\nnuclear weapon non-proliferation safeguards and \r\nverification. In that regard, Malaysia does not see any \r\nneed to impose any new or additional legally binding \r\nsafeguards obligation on NPT States parties as a \r\nprerequisite for the peaceful use of nuclear technology \r\nbeyond those of the Comprehensive Safeguards \r\nAgreements and the Model Additional Protocol. \r\n In order to preserve the relevance of the IAEA to \r\nthe needs of its developing member States, renewed \r\nattention should be directed to the promotional aspects \r\nof the Agency’s mandate in terms of technical \r\ncooperation. In view of the respective obligations of \r\nmember States concerning IAEA safeguards, Malaysia \r\nrejects any approach that would have the effect of \r\ngranting a right for the IAEA secretariat to exclude \r\ncertain technologies from the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. \r\n Malaysia believes that any notion of a global \r\nnuclear order should not worsen the dichotomy \r\nbetween developing and developed member States by \r\nendorsing an emerging regime of nuclear technology \r\nsuppliers and recipients on top of an existing regime of \r\nnuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States. \r\nThat is especially important in the current period, \r\nwhere more developing States need to develop \r\nlegitimate peaceful nuclear power programmes to \r\nensure their energy security and long-term sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Malaysia further believes that any initiative to \r\ndevelop any multilateral approach to the nuclear fuel \r\ncycle and fuel supply assurances should not create such \r\na new regime of nuclear technology haves and have-\r\nnots. Malaysia firmly believes that the establishment of \r\nany such multilateral approach or regime should be \r\nbased on extensive, comprehensive and transparent \r\nconsultation between all interested parties and member \r\nStates, and that all decisions should be taken by \r\nconsensus. \r\n Finally, Malaysia would like to express once \r\nagain its appreciation to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, \r\nDirector General of the IAEA, as well as to the IAEA \r\nsecretariat for their significant and valuable work in \r\nfulfilling the three pillars of the Agency’s mandate. \r\nMalaysia pledges its full support to the IAEA, as one \r\nof the organizations of the United Nations system, so \r\nthat it may continue to uphold and maintain its central \r\nand universal role in addressing the enormous \r\nchallenges ahead. \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): I would like to express \r\nJapan’s appreciation to the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for having submitted the \r\nAgency’s annual report. \r\n The IAEA plays a crucial role in maintaining \r\npeace and promoting global prosperity. It disseminates \r\nthe benefits of nuclear technology for humanity. It \r\nverifies non-proliferation. It provides services to \r\ndeveloping countries. Those functions are becoming \r\nincreasingly important. \r\n Japan has been making significant contributions \r\nto the IAEA as a member of its Board of Governors \r\nsince its foundation and also as a lead country in \r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Japan \r\nadheres to the three non-nuclear principles and is \r\ncommitted to strengthening the IAEA safeguards \r\nsystem by sharing its advanced safeguards technology. \r\nThe scientific knowledge and technology acquired by \r\nJapan is shared with many developing countries \r\nthrough the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme. \r\n Nuclear energy provides great capacity and \r\npotential for ensuring a reliable and clean energy \r\nsupply. The value of nuclear energy has been \r\nrediscovered in our common efforts to combat global \r\nwarming. In the recent years of the so-called nuclear \r\nrenaissance, a growing number of countries are \r\nexpressing their interest in introducing or expanding \r\nnuclear power programmes. \r\n Nuclear power programmes must be developed in \r\nthe most secure way and strictly for peaceful purposes. \r\nIt is vitally important that non-proliferation safeguards, \r\nnuclear safety and nuclear security — in other words, \r\nthe “three S’s” — be ensured. The role of the IAEA is \r\ntherefore becoming ever more important. Earlier this \r\nyear, an international initiative proposed by Japan on \r\nthree S’s-based nuclear energy infrastructure was \r\nlaunched at the Hokkaido Toyako summit of the Group \r\nA/63/PV.32  \r\n \r\n08-57118 4 \r\n \r\nof Eight. In cooperation with the Agency, Japan would \r\nlike to take measures to follow up that initiative and \r\nexpand support to those countries planning to start up \r\nnuclear power generation. \r\n As the only country that has endured atomic \r\nbombings, Japan is determined to continue to work \r\nstrenuously for the elimination of all nuclear weapons. \r\nAs part of such efforts, Japan, together with many \r\nsponsors, has just presented a draft resolution on \r\nnuclear disarmaments to the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nwill provide another important opportunity. The second \r\nsession of the Preparatory Committee, held in April to \r\nMay this year, was more substantive than that held last \r\nyear, and it successfully adopted a procedural agenda. \r\nWe hope that the third session will be productive and \r\nthat it will pave the way to a successful Review \r\nConference. \r\n The International Commission on Nuclear \r\nNon-proliferation and Disarmament, established this \r\nyear by Japan and Australia, has commenced its \r\nactivity by holding its first meeting in Sydney last \r\nweek. We hope that the Commission will also make \r\nmeaningful contributions to the success of the 2010 \r\nReview Conference. \r\n Nuclear non-proliferation must be verified \r\nthrough the internationally credible and objective \r\nsafeguards system. Japan has made every effort to earn \r\ninternational confidence in its extensive activities by \r\nfully cooperating with the IAEA and maintaining a \r\nhigh level of transparency. As a result, the IAEA has \r\nconcluded that Japan’s nuclear programmes are \r\nexclusively for peaceful purposes. The integrated \r\nsafeguards system has now been implemented in Japan \r\nand the world’s first site level integrated safeguards \r\napproach was introduced last month for facilities, \r\nincluding a reprocessing plant, in the most efficient \r\nmanner. \r\n The nuclear development undertaken by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is a threat to \r\nthe peace and security not only of Japan, but also of \r\nEast Asia and the entire international community. It \r\nrepresents a serious challenge to the NPT regime. In \r\nthe Six-Party Talks, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea has not yet agreed to a concrete framework of \r\nverifications. \r\n The establishment of an effective verification \r\nframework by the Six-Party Talks is essential for the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula. By first \r\nstriving towards an expeditious agreement of such a \r\nframework, Japan will continue to actively work \r\ntowards the peaceful resolution of nuclear issues within \r\nthe framework of the Six-Party Talks. \r\n Iran has, regrettably, continued and even \r\nexpanded its uranium enrichment-related activities, \r\ndespite repeated calls by the international community. \r\nIn order to remove concerns and to gain the confidence \r\nof the international community, Iran has to fully \r\ncooperate with the Agency and respond sincerely to the \r\nrequirements set forth by the relevant IAEA Board and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Japan continues to work \r\ntowards a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the \r\nissue. \r\n The vital missions of the IAEA continue to grow. \r\nI assure the Assembly that Japan will continue to play a \r\nleading role in contributing to the work of the IAEA \r\nwith its experience and knowledge. Japan has fielded \r\nAmbassador Yukiya Amano, the former Chairman of \r\nthe Board of Governors of the IAEA, as a candidate to \r\nbe the next Director General of the IAEA. I strongly \r\nurge members’ support for his candidacy. \r\n Mr. Gatan (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nwelcomes the report introduced by the Director General \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nrecognizes the importance of the Agency. At the same \r\ntime, the Philippines agrees with the Director General’s \r\nassessment that the Agency is at a crossroads. Since it \r\nwas founded some 50 years ago, the IAEA has helped \r\nmember States achieve their development goals and \r\ncontributed to international peace and security. The \r\nworld today faces a complex web of challenges, such as \r\nthe fluctuating and unpredictable cost of fossil fuel, \r\nclimate change, food and financial crises and a political \r\nenvironment that impinges on the relevance and \r\neffectiveness of the Agency. The Philippines believes \r\nthat, for the Agency to move forward to meet the \r\nchallenges and opportunities of the coming decades, an \r\nenabling environment for a reinvigorated global nuclear \r\norder is necessary. \r\n The Philippines foresees a renaissance of nuclear \r\nenergy over the next two decades that will be an \r\noverarching force that will create opportunities as well \r\nas challenges for member States and the IAEA itself. \r\nDriven by fluctuating fossil fuel prices and the fact that \r\n A/63/PV.32\r\n \r\n5 08-57118 \r\n \r\nthis energy source is finite and harmful to the \r\nenvironment, many countries are increasingly turning \r\nto nuclear energy. \r\n Given that development, there must be training \r\nfor a new generation of human resources; the design of \r\nreactors that are safe, secure, economical and \r\nproliferation-resistant; an assured supply of nuclear \r\nfuel; radioactive waste management, including \r\ndisposal; effective and quick radiological emergency \r\nresponse system; and public acceptance. Towards those \r\nends, the Philippines supports strengthened \r\ncooperation at the regional and international levels. \r\n The Philippines is also of the view that the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy — specifically the use \r\nof nuclear power, which can lead to sustained \r\ndevelopment — provide immense benefits for \r\ndeveloping countries. In that regard, the Philippines \r\nGovernment is reassessing the possibility of using \r\nnuclear power as one of the sources of energy to meet \r\nthe ever-growing demands from our energy sector, \r\nbrought about by a robust and growing economy. \r\n Enlarging the contribution of nuclear applications \r\nis important not only for their contributions to the well- \r\nbeing of humanity, but also for the concept of the \r\nuniversality of benefits to member States. The \r\nPhilippines believes that an expansion of the mandate \r\nof the Agency in that regard will strengthen the support \r\nof the developing countries for the IAEA. We reiterate \r\nthe critical role of the Agency’s safeguards and \r\nverification activities in ensuring nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation. The Philippines commends the \r\nefforts of the Director General and the Secretariat in \r\nthat regard. \r\n The Philippines and the IAEA have expansive \r\nlinks in other areas of technical cooperation, and that \r\npartnership has accomplished much in terms of \r\nincreasing industrial productivity, the irradiation of \r\nfood exports, access to clean drinking water and \r\naddressing other environmental challenges. \r\n The Philippines and the IAEA also cooperate in \r\nthe important field of cancer therapy through the \r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT). The \r\nPhilippines is pleased that the Agency made that a \r\npriority activity, given the rise in number of cancer \r\npatients, particularly in the developing world. That \r\ncollaboration with PACT will lead to enhanced cancer \r\ntraining capabilities in the region in the context of the \r\nregional cancer training network. The Philippines urges \r\nmember States to continue to support the Programme \r\nthrough additional contributions. \r\n The Philippines commends the achievement of \r\nthe Agency in its comprehensive programme to combat \r\nthe risk of nuclear terrorism and to assist Member \r\nStates in strengthening their nuclear security. The \r\nPhilippines appreciates the Agency’s assistance in \r\nstarting its nuclear security programme. \r\n As more countries look to the possibility of \r\nadding nuclear power to satisfy their ever-increasing \r\nenergy needs and as demand for technical cooperation \r\nfrom developing countries continues to increase to \r\nmeet development needs, the Agency must continue to \r\nplay its vital role in enabling developing countries to \r\nuse science and technology for development and for \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. Needless \r\nto say, the IAEA can do so only with a renewed sense \r\nof cooperation and strong partnerships with Member \r\nStates. \r\n In closing, let me reiterate the continuing \r\ncooperation and commitment of the Philippines to the \r\nIAEA as we meet the challenges and opportunities of \r\nthe twenty-first century. \r\n Mr. De Figueiredo (Angola): Allow me to join \r\nprevious speakers in congratulating Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann on his election to preside over the \r\nsixty-third session of the General Assembly. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our appreciation to the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the \r\nAgency’s secretariat for the comprehensive 2007 annual \r\nreport, through which we have learned more about the \r\nactivities carried out by the Agency in the past year \r\nunder the three pillars of its mandate: technology, \r\nsafety, and security and verification. The 2007 annual \r\nreport confirms that the Agency’s activities are central \r\nto the maximization of the use of nuclear technology \r\nfor socio-economic development and for preventing its \r\nmisuse for non-peaceful purposes. \r\n The Republic of Angola attaches paramount \r\nimportance to the Technical Cooperation Programme of \r\nthe IAEA, as it considers it to be an efficient tool for \r\nthe use of nuclear science and technology for peaceful \r\npurposes. It contributes to the solution of problems in \r\nareas such as human and animal health, agriculture and \r\nfood, industry, groundwater management, energy \r\nproduction and the environment. In that connection, the \r\nA/63/PV.32  \r\n \r\n08-57118 6 \r\n \r\nAngolan Government has noted with appreciation the \r\ninformation contained in the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Report 2007, indicating that 122 member \r\nStates and territories benefited from the technical \r\nassistance provided by the IAEA in the year 2007. \r\nThirty-seven African countries benefited from that \r\nassistance in the same year, with the Agency’s support \r\nessentially concentrated on human health, agriculture \r\nand food. \r\n The eradication or control of cancer, sleeping \r\nsickness, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and pest \r\ninsects is one of the important preconditions for the \r\nreduction of extreme poverty and hunger by \r\n50 per cent by 2015, as foreseen by the United Nations. \r\nIn that regard, the Government of Angola strongly \r\nsupports the Agency programme for the application of \r\nthe sterile insect technique in member States to combat \r\nthe tsetse fly. Research with a view to utilizing that \r\ntechnique against anopheles, locusts and other pest \r\ninsects should be intensified. \r\n The cooperation with the African Union and other \r\npertinent regional and international institutions aimed \r\nat harmonizing all efforts in conformity with the \r\nAfrican Union’s Pan-African Tsetse and \r\nTrypanosomosis Eradication Campaign should be \r\nstrengthened. \r\n The partnership between the IAEA and the Food \r\nand Agriculture Agency of the United Nations (FAO) \r\nhas successfully resulted in a strengthening of the \r\ncapacity to apply nuclear technology in key agriculture \r\nprojects. That includes the efficiency and sustainability \r\nof land and water management; breeding new crops \r\nwith special qualities and adapted to marginal \r\nenvironments; improving animal production and \r\nhealth; controlling insects that are major pests for \r\nplants and livestock; and increasing food safety while \r\nfacilitating international trade. Taking into \r\nconsideration all the aforementioned benefits deriving \r\nfrom that partnership, the Government of Angola \r\nexpresses its deep concern about the intention of the \r\nFAO to terminate that valuable cooperation at the end \r\nof this year, and appeals to both organizations to \r\nreview the issue. \r\n With the support of the Agency, the Angolan \r\nGovernment is implementing eight national projects \r\nand participating in 15 regional ones. The national \r\nprojects deal with the establishment of the first \r\nradiotherapy centre in the country; the introduction of \r\nnuclear medicine techniques in clinical practices; \r\nveterinary drug residue monitoring; isotope techniques \r\nto study the effect of bio and inorganic fertilizers; \r\nmutation breeding; and the establishment of a \r\nnon-destructive testing laboratory for industrial \r\napplications. \r\n In 2007, Angolan technicians benefited from \r\nscientific visits and research grants abroad. In that \r\ncontext, special mention is to be made of the field of \r\nionizing radiation. The regulation of its use for medical \r\npurposes in several hospitals in the capital, the \r\ninspection of various health-care centres in the country \r\nand the installation and use of X-ray equipment and \r\nother radioactive sources oriented towards industrial \r\nradiography have greatly contributed to providing \r\nbetter assistance to the population. My Government \r\nwishes to strengthen its cooperation with the Agency \r\non matters concerning radiotherapy and nuclear \r\nmedicine in order to strengthen the National Oncology \r\nCentre. \r\n For the 2009-2011 cycle, the Angolan \r\nGovernment seeks support for the implementation of \r\nseven projects in the areas of nuclear physics, \r\nagriculture, human health, water resources, industrial \r\napplications and radiation protection. Four have \r\nalready been selected: the establishment of a phase II \r\nlaboratory for teaching nuclear physics; strengthening \r\nnational capability in medical physics; strengthening \r\nnational capability in the prevention, maintenance and \r\nrepair of scientific instruments and nuclear medicine \r\nequipment; and national regulatory control and \r\noccupational radiation protection programmes. \r\n With regard to the implementation of the IAEA \r\nsafeguards, the Angolan Government recognizes the \r\nright of all States to make full use of nuclear \r\ntechnology and scientific applications without \r\ndiscrimination and in conformity with the Agency’s \r\nstatute. \r\n To conclude, the Government of the Republic of \r\nAngola recommends the approval of the report of the \r\nIAEA by the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): It is a profound honour \r\nand pleasure to address this Assembly on behalf of my \r\ndelegation on the important agenda item before us for \r\nconsideration in this plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly today. In that regard, I would like at the \r\noutset to express my deepest appreciation and gratitude \r\nto the Director General of the International Atomic \r\n A/63/PV.32\r\n \r\n7 08-57118 \r\n \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Mohammed ElBaradei, \r\nfor his informative report on the work of the Agency. \r\n I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nnote (A/63/276) transmitting the report of the Agency \r\nto the General Assembly. I am very confident that both \r\ndocuments will make a useful contribution to an \r\ninformed consideration of, in particular, draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.6, submitted for adoption in \r\nconnection with the agenda item now being discussed. \r\n As we all know, the IAEA has been working for \r\nthe realization of the “Atoms for Peace” vision since \r\nthe day of its establishment. It is indeed gratifying to \r\nrecall that the Agency and its Director General won the \r\n2005 Nobel Peace Prize for their outstanding \r\ncontribution to global peace and security. We felt a \r\nmodest sense of satisfaction at seeing the Agency \r\ncelebrate its fiftieth anniversary with such a \r\nmagnificent achievement.  \r\n As a founding member of the IAEA, Ethiopia has \r\nalways attached and will continue to attach great \r\nsignificance to the maintenance of global peace and \r\nsecurity, all the more so in connection with the specific \r\narea upon which the Agency is entrusted and mandated \r\nto focus. \r\n As regards the use of nuclear energy, I am \r\npleased to inform this gathering that Ethiopia is \r\nengaged in a number of national and regional projects \r\napplying nuclear techniques with the aim of addressing \r\nvarious socio-economic development problems in the \r\nareas of agriculture, human health, water resource \r\nmanagement, energy planning, non-destructive testing, \r\nnuclear instrumentation and radiation protection. The \r\ncountry is pursuing a focused approach in areas of high \r\nrelevance to promoting socio-economic development \r\nobjectives. \r\n Our biggest technical cooperation project with \r\nthe IAEA is aimed at eradicating the tsetse fly from the \r\n25,000 square kilometres in the southern Rift Valley \r\narea of Ethiopia. Initiated in 1997, the project uses the \r\nsterile insect technique (SIT) as part of an integrated \r\npest management approach. It is still of the highest \r\npriority in Ethiopia’s technical cooperation with the \r\nAgency, particularly since over 240,000 square \r\nkilometres of fertile agricultural land in the western \r\nand southern parts of the country are infested by five \r\ndifferent species of tsetse fly that transmit \r\ntrypanosomiasis. \r\n The project includes three major components: \r\nsuppression of the existing fly population, \r\nestablishment of a centrally operated sterile insect \r\nproduction plant, and a field operation to control and \r\neradicate the fly population using SIT technology. The \r\nsuppression activities have already reduced the \r\nprevalence of trypanosomiasis among the livestock in \r\nthe treated area. A tsetse fly-breeding and irradiation \r\nfacility in Addis Ababa was officially inaugurated in \r\nFebruary 2007, and the first pilot release of sterile \r\ntsetse flies was successfully carried out, with the \r\nencouraging result of a 95-per-cent survival rate two to \r\nthree weeks after release. \r\n The project has made significant progress with \r\nthe support of the IAEA, the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization and the OPEC Fund for International \r\nDevelopment, as well as with generous assistance from \r\nthe Governments of the United States of America and \r\nChina. The African Development Bank and the United \r\nNations Trust Fund for Human Security, funded by the \r\nGovernment of Japan, have also joined our efforts to \r\nmake that model project a success story in Africa, \r\nwhere about 37 countries are believed to have been \r\nseriously affected by the problem. We are greatly \r\nencouraged by the firm commitment of all those \r\ninternational organizations and development partners \r\nto continue to support the efforts of the Ethiopian \r\nGovernment, for which we remain sincerely grateful. \r\n Ethiopia’s technical cooperation activities with \r\nthe Agency in the areas of human health and water \r\nresource management have also resulted in a modest \r\nnational infrastructure for the application of nuclear \r\nmedicine, radiotherapy and isotope hydrology. The \r\ncountry recently acquired a new cobalt machine, with a \r\nnew source, through a cost-sharing arrangement \r\nbetween the Agency and the Government to help \r\nimprove the only radiotherapy centre still serving the \r\ncountry’s more than 77 million people. \r\n Some preliminary data indicate that only about \r\n400 cancer patients out of an estimated 115,000 new \r\ncancer cases per annum are treated by means of \r\nradiotherapy. That clearly shows the inadequacy of the \r\nservices in that critical area of concern. For that reason \r\nthe Government of Ethiopia, in collaboration with the \r\nIAEA, has developed an action plan to extend \r\nradiotherapy and nuclear medicine services to five \r\nhospitals located in different parts of the country. We \r\ntherefore call on all our development partners to step \r\nup their generous technical and financial support to \r\nA/63/PV.32  \r\n \r\n08-57118 8 \r\n \r\nhelp us implement the action plan and save the lives of \r\nthousands of people dealing with cancer through well-\r\nequipped and expanded radiotherapy and nuclear \r\nmedicine services in the country. \r\n In addition, our technical cooperation with the \r\nIAEA to apply isotope techniques in managing our \r\nwater resources has enabled us to build some basic \r\ncapacity to generate useful isotopic data. The \r\nestablishment of an isotope hydrology laboratory at \r\nAddis Ababa University and a national groundwater \r\ndatabase system, as well as training the necessary \r\npersonnel, constitute some of the major strides made so \r\nfar in laying the basic infrastructure for an Ethiopian \r\ngroundwater resources programme, which is part of the \r\nGovernment’s 15-year water sector development \r\nprogramme. \r\n The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) \r\nhas shown some promising steps towards enhancing \r\nthe relevance and efficiency of its activities, including \r\nthrough its Joint Division with the IAEA, which is \r\nimportant for developing and least developed countries \r\nin particular. The Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear \r\nTechniques in Food and Agriculture has been \r\nespecially instrumental in creating synergy between the \r\ntwo organizations and, from our perspective, in \r\nsupporting our efforts to eradicate the tsetse fly and \r\ntrypanosomiasis. Ethiopia believes that any measure to \r\nterminate the Joint FAO/IAEA Division would \r\nadversely affect that synergy, with a shared objective \r\nof contributing to the maintenance of global food \r\nsecurity. We therefore call for the reinforcement of that \r\nuseful partnership between the two global \r\norganizations. \r\n We also firmly believe that provision of adequate \r\nand predictable resources to the Agency’s programmes \r\nand, more importantly, balanced distribution of \r\nresources to the Agency’s safeguards, nuclear safety \r\nand technical cooperation activities need to be ensured. \r\nThe Technical Cooperation Programme plays a crucial \r\nrole in transferring nuclear technology to developing \r\nmember States of the Agency. \r\n As the IAEA is expected to increase its efficiency \r\nand effectiveness in nuclear verification, nuclear safety \r\nand technology transfer, Ethiopia realizes the Agency’s \r\nneed to upgrade its laboratory and computation \r\nfacilities and to enhance its management information \r\nsystem, so as to maintain its competence and \r\nindependence. In line with that, implementation of the \r\nexternal auditor’s recommendation to adopt \r\nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards and \r\nan Agency-wide information system for programme \r\nsupport needs to be adequately addressed and \r\nsupported by Member States. \r\n Ethiopia believes that promoting the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear programmes would have manifold benefits \r\nfor all member States and humanity at large. In that \r\nregard, ratification and implementation of the \r\nadditional protocol to the safeguards agreement and the \r\nmodified small quantities protocol would help to \r\nenhance the verification process by the IAEA as the \r\ncompetent global authority mandated to do so. \r\nHowever, in addition to all that, universal application \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons is truly critical to ensuring global peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n As one of the founding members of the Agency, \r\nEthiopia is cognizant of its responsibility to control \r\nradioactive and other nuclear materials and to promote \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear applications for global and \r\nregional security. Moreover, as an outgoing member of \r\nthe IAEA Board of Governors, Ethiopia has also had \r\nthe honour and pleasure of serving member States of \r\nthe Agency to its level best in that capacity. We wish \r\nthe incoming members of the Board of Governors \r\nevery success and assure them of our continued \r\ncooperation and commitment to the lofty ideals of the \r\nAgency. \r\n Ethiopia has ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty and the Pelindaba Treaty on the \r\nAfrican Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. We have done so \r\non the basis of our long-standing commitment to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand, ultimately, to a nuclear-threat-free world. In that \r\nregard, it is important to underscore that nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation efforts can lead eventually to a \r\nnuclear-threat-free world if, and only if, they are \r\ncomplemented by genuine disarmament measures by \r\nall nuclear-weapon States. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to reiterate our profound \r\nthanks and appreciation to the IAEA, in particular to its \r\ngovernance and leadership, for their dedication to \r\nstrengthening crucially essential technical cooperation \r\nactivities between the Agency and my country. I would \r\nalso like to reassure the Assembly that, apart from \r\nabiding by its international obligations as a member \r\nState, Ethiopia will continue to do its utmost to further \r\n A/63/PV.32\r\n \r\n9 08-57118 \r\n \r\nenhance the positive spirit of cooperation with the \r\nAgency and with our development partners, who have \r\nthus far made generous contributions to our \r\ndevelopment endeavours in this particular field. \r\n Mr. Pramudwinai (Thailand): It is with great \r\nappreciation that the delegation of Thailand took note \r\nof the 2007 annual report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) (see A/63/276). Having just \r\ncompleted our term as a member of the Agency’s \r\nBoard of Governors for the period 2006 to 2008, \r\nThailand takes this opportunity to reaffirm its \r\ncontinued support for the Agency’s indispensable role \r\nin promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy and \r\nstrengthening the non-proliferation regime. Thailand \r\nbelieves that the IAEA’s role in enhancing human \r\nsecurity and the capacity of Member States to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals should be \r\naccentuated. \r\n Over the years, nuclear applications in the fields \r\nof human health and agriculture have been the \r\nhallmarks of partnership between Thailand and the \r\nIAEA. My delegation commends the Agency’s \r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy and its \r\nrecently formalized partnership with the World Health \r\nOrganization, which is geared towards preventing \r\ncancer and reducing cancer rates in developing nations. \r\nWe also support the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of \r\nNuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. Thailand \r\nsees the merit of continuing the FAO/IAEA partnership \r\nwith a view to responding to the demands and needs of \r\nMember States vis-à-vis food safety and food security. \r\n For developing countries to reap the benefits of \r\nnuclear technology, the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme remains the key component. \r\nOn our part, we have maintained active collaboration \r\nwith the Agency in various capacity-building activities. \r\nWe will continue to do so in the years to come.  \r\n Thailand believes that, as the Agency charts its \r\nfuture course in the so-called global nuclear order, \r\neffective management of the Agency will be crucial to \r\nenable it to respond adequately to various proliferation \r\nchallenges. We believe that it is important for the \r\nAgency to be provided with sufficient, assured and \r\npredictable resources to do its job. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation commends the Director General’s initiative \r\nto establish the Commission of Eminent Persons on the \r\nfuture of the Agency. We take note of the report of the \r\nCommission, which will be an important contribution \r\nin improving the work of the Agency between now and \r\n2020, and beyond.  \r\n Regarding another area of the global nuclear \r\norder, Thailand wishes to mention our proposal, along \r\nwith that of the countries of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), for the \r\nestablishment of the South Asian nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone. We support the establishment of nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree zones in all regions of the world. Any possible \r\nforum for an exchange of experiences on nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones should be welcomed as \r\nconstructive. The efforts of Mongolia in hosting the \r\nmeeting of the focal points of all regional nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones in April 2009 are highly \r\ncommendable. \r\n Strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime is a common and shared responsibility of the \r\ninternational community. Thailand is fully committed \r\nto the implementation of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We \r\nunderscore the role of the IAEA as the sole multilateral \r\nauthority for safeguards and verification. We also \r\nsupport efforts to enhance the effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the Agency’s safeguards system, \r\nincluding the Agency’s comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreements and additional protocols. As we approach \r\nthe convening of the third session of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference, \r\nwhich is to be held in New York next year, my \r\ndelegation hopes that the deliberations will lead to \r\nfurther progress on substantive issues. In that regard, \r\nThailand is also hopeful that the international \r\ncommunity will further step up its efforts to honour its \r\nNPT commitments, on both the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and the nuclear disarmament fronts. \r\n My delegation takes note of the Director \r\nGeneral’s report to the Board of Governors on the \r\nimplementation of safeguards in the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran throughout the past year. While we fully \r\nsupport the inalienable right of every NPT State party \r\nto develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, we \r\nmust ensure that that right is pursued in accordance \r\nwith the obligations under the NPT, the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements and the additional protocols. \r\nThailand looks forward to a peaceful settlement of the \r\nIran nuclear issue. We urge all parties concerned to \r\nstay the course of diplomacy and to refrain from \r\nconfrontation. \r\nA/63/PV.32  \r\n \r\n08-57118 10 \r\n \r\n On the recent developments in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Thailand expresses its \r\nsupport for the ongoing dialogue within the framework \r\nof the Six-Party Talks aimed at achieving long-term \r\npeace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. We \r\nwelcome the progress made towards the full and \r\nbalanced implementation of the 2005 Joint Statement. \r\nOn our part, Thailand will continue to work closely \r\nwith our partners in the ASEAN Regional Forum to \r\ncontribute to progress in the complete and verifiable \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \r\n We commend the IAEA’s role as a cornerstone of \r\nthe global non-proliferation regime and join other \r\nmembers of the international community in praising \r\nthe Agency’s annual report, which not only reflects a \r\ntrack record of accomplishments but also provides a \r\nrealistic outlook of where future challenges lie. In that \r\nregard, Thailand reiterates its full confidence in the \r\nintegrity, impartiality and professionalism of Director \r\nGeneral Mohamed ElBaradei and the IAEA secretariat \r\nin continuing that important work. \r\n Mr. Kyslytsya (Ukraine): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to congratulate the new member States joining the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), namely, \r\nthe Sultanate of Oman, the independent State of Papua \r\nNew Guinea and the Kingdom of Lesotho. I wish them \r\nevery success in their work at the Agency. The \r\nenlargement in the Agency’s membership is evidence \r\nof the growing prestige of that organization. \r\n Ukraine is satisfied with the fact that the Agency \r\nhas continued to act in accordance with the three main \r\npillars of its activity, that is, technology, safety and \r\nverification. Ukraine, which has 15 operational units at \r\nfour nuclear power plants, fully recognizes the role of \r\nthe Agency in developing nuclear power applications. \r\nNuclear power will remain an important energy \r\ncomponent providing for the economic security of the \r\nState from a middle- and long-term perspective, as \r\nenvisaged in Ukraine’s energy strategy for the period \r\nuntil 2030. \r\n The Technical Cooperation Programme continues \r\nto be one of the principal mechanisms for carrying out \r\nthe Agency’s basic mission. In 2007, Ukraine hosted \r\neight regional and interregional events within the \r\nframework of the Programme. Their topics reflected \r\nboth Ukraine’s considerable expertise and its needs \r\nwith regard to the dissemination of knowledge and \r\ntraining in the field of nuclear safety and security. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to mention the fact that \r\nUkrainian experts took an active part in the work of the \r\nAgency’s Safety Standards Committees. \r\n We welcome the Agency’s activities in the area of \r\nnuclear safety. Of particular importance for Ukraine in \r\nthat field are the problems of radioactive waste \r\nmanagement during the decommissioning of the \r\nChernobyl nuclear power plant and the transformation \r\nof the shelter object into an ecologically safe system. \r\nThe Agency continues to provide assistance in the \r\nremediation of the affected territories in Ukraine. The \r\nresults of the Agency’s recent activities in those areas \r\nlaid the groundwork for the United Nations Action Plan \r\non Chernobyl to 2016, which was prepared this year by \r\nthe Inter-Agency Task Force on Chernobyl. We hope \r\nthat the attention devoted to the Chernobyl issue will \r\nnot decrease, since further joint efforts are required in \r\norder to resolve that challenge to the entire \r\ninternational community.  \r\n Ukraine notes with satisfaction that, last year, the \r\nAgency completed a range of projects on the \r\nharmonization of safety assessment processes and the \r\ndemonstration of safety during the decommissioning of \r\nnuclear facilities. Of the 32 nuclear reactors being \r\ndismantled around the world, 4 are in Ukraine, and we \r\nbenefit from the lessons learned in that regard. \r\n We welcome the fact that, last year, the Agency \r\ncontinued to develop projects in the area of human \r\nhealth. In particular, Ukraine would like to emphasize \r\nthe importance of the Agency-initiated Programme of \r\nAction on Cancer Therapy, from which my country \r\nalso benefits. In 2007, the Agency provided assistance \r\naimed at improving nuclear security arrangements \r\nthrough the Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plans, \r\nin which Ukraine also actively participated. In \r\nparticular, the Agency continued to strengthen border \r\ncontrol capabilities in many Member States by \r\nproviding radiation-detection instruments and by \r\ntraining hundreds of people in the area of nuclear-\r\nsecurity-related responsibilities. \r\n I would like to note with appreciation that, in \r\n2007, the Agency continued its efforts to develop \r\nnuclear fuel supply assurances. Ukraine, which \r\npossesses sufficient deposits of uranium, looks forward \r\nto participating in future consortiums and to providing \r\nuranium ore to meet relevant needs. We are open to \r\ninternational cooperation in that area. As a potential \r\nuranium exporter, Ukraine welcomes the formulation \r\n A/63/PV.32\r\n \r\n11 08-57118 \r\n \r\nby the Agency last year of draft best practices in the \r\nareas of radiation management, health and safety, \r\nwaste and the environment and related regulatory \r\naspects of uranium mining. \r\n We appreciate the Agency’s support for the \r\nprocess of converting research reactors from highly \r\nenriched uranium to low-enriched uranium fuel. \r\nUkraine fully supports that programme and took an \r\nactive part in repatriating highly enriched uranium to \r\nits country of origin.  \r\n We highly value the Agency’s International \r\nProject on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel \r\nCycles. Last year, Ukraine decided to provide the \r\nproject with a cost-free expert. \r\n Ukraine wishes to reaffirm its support for \r\nactivities to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of \r\nthe safeguards system and welcomes the Agency’s \r\nefforts to prevent the diversion of nuclear energy from \r\npeaceful uses to military purposes, to detect covert \r\nweapon activities and to reduce the risk of nuclear and \r\nradiological terrorism. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express our great \r\nappreciation for the efforts of Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, \r\nDirector General of the Agency, and of the Agency’s \r\nsecretariat to strengthen international cooperation in \r\nthe area of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which \r\nwere demonstrated last year. Through its nuclear \r\npower, nuclear applications and technical cooperation \r\nprogrammes, the Agency continues to meet global \r\nchallenges and to assist member States in addressing \r\nissues such as energy supply, nuclear safety, human \r\nhealth, food security, water availability, resource \r\nconservation and environmental protection. \r\n Finally, I wish to state that Ukraine fully supports \r\ndraft resolution A/63/L.6, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”. \r\n Mr. Kim Bonghyun (Republic of Korea): My \r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his \r\ncomprehensive briefing on the Agency’s broad range of \r\nactivities. We are pleased to take note of the Agency’s \r\nrecent achievements in the fields of nuclear energy, \r\nnuclear applications, safety and security and \r\nverification, as described in the annual report of the \r\nIAEA for 2007 (see A/63/276). \r\n The Republic of Korea underlines the importance \r\nof the IAEA in promoting the safe, secure and peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear science and technology, and we would \r\nlike to reaffirm our commitment to cooperate with the \r\nAgency in all areas of its activities. \r\n My delegation also commends the recent report \r\nentitled Reinforcing the Global Nuclear Order for \r\nPeace and Prosperity: The Role of the IAEA to 2020 \r\nand Beyond. In our view, that report was timely, and \r\nthe global nuclear system should be consolidated and \r\nreinforced in order to address the new opportunities \r\nand challenges arising from the expanded use of \r\nnuclear energy. The IAEA, with its expertise and \r\nprofessionalism, should continue to play a crucial role \r\nin supporting the nuclear renaissance in the coming \r\nyears. \r\n In that regard, my delegation would like to touch \r\nupon some issues that we consider relevant to the \r\nfuture work of the IAEA. \r\n First, the universalization of the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreement and the additional protocol is an \r\nessential means to improve the current safeguards and \r\nverification regime. We would like to call upon those \r\nStates that have not yet done so to conclude such \r\nagreements and bring them into force without delay. \r\nThe additional protocol should become a verification \r\nstandard, as recent events have suggested that the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement alone is no \r\nlonger adequate in enabling the Agency to fully \r\nimplement its mandate. \r\n Secondly, the Republic of Korea attaches great \r\nimportance to the issue of a new multilateral \r\nframework for guaranteeing the supply of nuclear fuel. \r\nAny new mechanism should provide economical, \r\nreliable and equitable access to nuclear fuels, while \r\nlimiting proliferation risks. As a major user of nuclear \r\nenergy, the Republic of Korea will continue to \r\nparticipate in and make positive contributions to the \r\nrelevant discussions on that issue. \r\n Thirdly, nuclear terrorism remains the most \r\nimminent threat to the peace and security of the \r\ninternational community. The Nuclear Security Report \r\n2008, in our view, contains very useful information \r\nthat will assist State and non-State actors alike in \r\naddressing certain aspects of that grave issue. We \r\nrecognize the important role of the Agency as a focal \r\npoint in facilitating the enhancement of nuclear \r\nsecurity at both the national and the international \r\nA/63/PV.32  \r\n \r\n08-57118 12 \r\n \r\nlevels. The Agency’s experiences should be shared \r\nwith other international organizations and with relevant \r\nglobal initiatives. \r\n The expanded use of nuclear energy requires the \r\nstrengthening of nuclear non-proliferation and \r\nheightened security measures as never before. In that \r\nregard, my delegation would like to emphasize that the \r\npeaceful resolution of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea nuclear issue is vital to securing \r\nlasting peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula \r\nand in North-East Asia. My delegation would like to \r\nreiterate that the framework of the Six-Party Talks \r\nremains the most effective tool for resolving the \r\nnuclear issue related to the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea.  \r\n Since last June, we have witnessed ups and \r\ndowns with regard to that issue. The Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea submitted a declaration of \r\nits nuclear programme in June of this year and, at the \r\nheads of delegation meeting of the sixth round of the \r\nSix-Party Talks, held in Beijing last July, the \r\nparticipants reached a consensus on the full \r\nimplementation of the second-phase actions and agreed \r\nto establish a verification mechanism and a monitoring \r\nmechanism within the Six-Party Talks process. \r\n We welcome the Six-Party Talks being brought \r\nback on track through the recent agreements on \r\nverification, the subsequent United States action to \r\nremove the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nfrom the list of State sponsors of terrorism, and the \r\nresumption of disablement measures by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. We hope that the next \r\nround of Six-Party Talks will be held as soon as possible \r\nand that a verification protocol will be concluded among \r\nthe six parties for verifying the completeness and \r\ncorrectness of the declaration submitted by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n My delegation would like to highlight the IAEA’s \r\ncontinued essential role in the verification process. As \r\nthe Six-Party Talks process proceeds, my Government \r\nwill continue to work closely with all parties concerned \r\nto resolve the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s \r\nnuclear issue in a peaceful manner, and trusts that the \r\ninternational community will continue to render its \r\nvaluable support in the denuclearization process. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): \r\nMr. President, my delegation would like to thank you \r\nfor having convened this meeting to consider the report \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It \r\nwould like to voice its appreciation to the Director \r\nGeneral of the Agency for having given a most \r\nimpressive statement this morning and for having \r\nhighlighted the challenges now confronting the \r\ninternational community in the area of the exploitation \r\nof nuclear energy in the present context. \r\n One thing particularly struck us. The acquisition \r\nof the technological capacity for uranium enrichment \r\nand the isolation of plutonium makes the countries that \r\nbenefit from cooperation with the Agency potential \r\nnuclear-weapon States, given the ease with which \r\nnuclear material can be diverted to military purposes. \r\nThat observation is all the more concerning since the \r\ngrowing demand for energy is prompting a nuclear \r\nrenaissance and consequently an increase in the \r\nnumber of countries that wish to have access to nuclear \r\nenergy as a way to meet their needs. \r\n Access to nuclear energy is an inalienable right of \r\nall sovereign States. Nevertheless, it is important that \r\nthe international community be endowed with the \r\nmeans to prevent an exponential increase in nuclear-\r\nweapon States. It is therefore necessary to strengthen \r\nthe authority of the Agency to ensure unfailing \r\nmonitoring of nuclear energy production activities \r\nthrough more binding methods of preventing the misuse \r\nof existing production capacity for military purposes. \r\n We support the proposal of the Agency to create a \r\nmultilateral fissile material bank to ensure the ongoing \r\nsupply of fissile fuel to all existing nuclear installations \r\nor those yet to be built, free from political influence. \r\nThe inability of the IAEA to provide assurances on the \r\nnuclear activities of States without an additional \r\nprotocol or the various other factors that ensure the \r\nperceived security of States offer no effective \r\nguarantee regarding access to nuclear weapons. \r\n In our view, there is a need to encourage the \r\ncreation and transfer of a technology for nuclear energy \r\nproduction that does not directly confer the capability \r\nof acquiring nuclear weapons. European countries have \r\nstated over the last few years that they are making \r\nprogress in that direction, and that deserves the support \r\nof the international community. \r\n The Agency should become further involved in \r\nresearch to widen the technological gap between the \r\ncapacity to use nuclear energy peacefully and that to \r\nproduce nuclear weapons. Generally speaking, Benin \r\nsupports the recommendations of the Commission of \r\n A/63/PV.32\r\n \r\n13 08-57118 \r\n \r\nEminent Persons convened by the Agency to secure the \r\nuse of nuclear energy for peaceful ends while reducing \r\nthe risks of proliferation, which are now at an \r\nunacceptable level. The international community, \r\nhowever, must also strengthen the multilateral \r\nmechanism for the settlement of disputes concerning \r\nnuclear materials. The role of the Agency in that \r\nrespect is critical. \r\n A second major challenge that emerges from the \r\nAgency’s annual report is the exacerbation of the risks \r\nof proliferation to non-State actors in situations \r\ninvolving the spread of registered fissile materials. The \r\nfact that in an impressive number of cases the theft of \r\nfissile materials has never been resolved exposes us to \r\nterrible danger. \r\n The international community should strengthen \r\nits capacity to monitor fissile materials and to locate \r\nand ensure the recovery of stolen materials. To that \r\nend, there is a need to make full use of the potential for \r\ncooperation and exchange of information offered by \r\nresolution 1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction to non-State actors. All \r\nStates must understand and be aware of the risks linked \r\nto that phenomenon and strive to identify a systematic \r\npolicy of prevention. The creation of a global network \r\nfor cooperation and the exchange of information would \r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of those means which the \r\nUnited Nations is using to move forward in that area. \r\n We encourage efforts to promote the use of \r\nnuclear energy for the purposes of development, in \r\nparticular in the areas of agriculture and health. Those \r\nare purposes highly beneficial to humanity that will \r\nhelp us to meet existential challenges. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation will support the \r\ndraft resolution to be adopted on the report of the \r\nAgency. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n Before giving the floor to the representative of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, who \r\nwishes to speak in explanation of position on the draft \r\nresolution, I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote or position are limited to 10 minutes and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Sin Song Chol (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): The delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea wishes to stress its position \r\nwith regard to draft resolution A/63/L.6, entitled \r\n“Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency”.  \r\n As described in the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) report and resolution GC(52)/RES/14, \r\ncited in the draft resolution before us, the Agency has \r\nnot yet abandoned its prejudiced and unfair position on \r\nthe nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. \r\n The nuclear issue that we are talking about here \r\nis a direct product of the hostile policies of the United \r\nStates of America towards the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, and the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is still designated by the United \r\nStates as a target for a pre-emptive nuclear strike. \r\n In spite of those undeniable facts, the IAEA has \r\npersistently ignored the root causes of the nuclear issue \r\nand disregarded the honest and sincere efforts of the \r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea to settle the issue. Worse yet, the Agency \r\nattempted to infringe upon the sovereignty of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, insisting on \r\nspecial inspections in our country in concert with the \r\nUnited States, which generated the nuclear issue. That \r\nbiased and unjust attitude of the IAEA only \r\ncomplicated the process of attempting to resolve the \r\nnuclear issue. \r\n Unless the IAEA takes an impartial position \r\ntowards the settlement of the problem, in keeping with \r\nits assigned mission, no measures taken or resolutions \r\nadopted by the IAEA will help to resolve the nuclear \r\nissue. That has been vividly demonstrated throughout \r\nthe process of attempting to resolve the nuclear issue.  \r\n As a result of those considerations, the delegation \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea strongly \r\nrejects resolution GC(52)/RES/14, adopted at the \r\nGeneral Conference of the IAEA. The delegation of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will closely \r\nmonitor the future stands and activities of the IAEA \r\nvis-à-vis the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. \r\n The Government of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is consistent in its position that the \r\nnuclear issue should be resolved peacefully through \r\ndialogue and negotiations. As is well known, there is, \r\non the one hand, the 19 September 2005 Joint \r\nStatement, which was agreed by the six parties at the \r\nTalks and welcomed by the international community, \r\nand, on the other, the principle of action for action, \r\nwhich constitutes a criterion for assessing its \r\nA/63/PV.32  \r\n \r\n08-57118 14 \r\n \r\nimplementation. To date, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea has faithfully honoured all of its \r\ncommitments under every agreement reached by the \r\nsix parties at the Talks, including the Joint Statement, \r\nin conformity with the principle of action for action, \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\ncontinue to do so. If the other parties at the Talks do \r\nthe same by faithfully fulfilling their own obligations, \r\nthe process of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula will \r\nadvance smoothly.  \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to conclude its \r\nexplanation of position by disclosing Japan’s true \r\nmindset regarding the nuclear issue. Although it is a \r\nparty to the Talks and loudly pretends that it is \r\ninterested in the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula, Japan tends to be negative and insincere \r\nregarding the resolution of the nuclear issue. Indeed, \r\nthat attitude is a deliberate, ill-natured move to \r\nhamstring the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula.  \r\n As we have witnessed on various occasions \r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly, \r\nmost countries, in speaking about the nuclear issue, \r\nwelcome the recent agreement between the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States and \r\nexpress the hope that the Six-Party Talks will make \r\nprogress. But Japan has been unique in exposing its \r\nstereotypes, assigning blame and complaining \r\nwherever and whenever opportunities to do so are \r\nprovided.  \r\n It is already widely known that Japan is a very \r\ndisruptive country that is trying at any cost to avoid \r\nmeeting its obligations and that has only created \r\nartificial obstacles in the process of the Six-Party \r\nTalks. What now concerns Japan is that, if the hostile \r\npolicies of the United States towards the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea are terminated, the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula is realized \r\nand lasting peace and stability is achieved in the region \r\nof North-East Asia, Japan will no longer have a pretext \r\nfor fulfilling its ambition to reinvade the region. Even \r\nnow, the only thing that Japan wants to do is reclaim \r\nthe sacred territory of Korea by reviving its militaristic \r\nghosts and disregarding the devastation wrought by its \r\ntremendous and large-scale past crimes against \r\nhumanity, rather than sincerely honour all its \r\ncommitments under the agreements reached at the Six-\r\nParty Talks.  \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea firmly believes that, if Japan had \r\nbeen excluded from the process of the Six-Party Talks, \r\nmuch greater and better progress would have been made \r\nby now in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe only speaker in explanation of position. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.6. Before proceeding to take action on \r\nthe draft resolution, I should like to announce that, since \r\nits introduction, the following countries have become \r\nsponsors: Albania, Angola, Armenia, Australia, Belize, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, \r\nColombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, \r\nEcuador, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, India, Iraq, Ireland, \r\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, \r\nMonaco, Montenegro, New Zealand, Nigeria, Panama, \r\nPeru, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, \r\nRomania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Singapore, \r\nSlovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/63/L.6?  \r\n Draft resolution A/63/L.6 was adopted \r\n(resolution 63/6). \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now \r\ncall on those representatives who wish to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat, in accordance with General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nexercise its right of reply in response to the explanation \r\nof position made by the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.  \r\n The allegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea that Japan is insincere in pursuing \r\nthe settlement of the denuclearization issue of the \r\nKorean peninsula is entirely groundless, and we are \r\ncertainly strongly opposed to that statement. The claim \r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that \r\nJapan seeks to become a military Power is totally false, \r\nand we categorically reject that allegation. In fact, it \r\nwas the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that \r\ncreated a great threat to peace and security in North-\r\nEast Asia when it announced that it was carrying out a \r\n A/63/PV.32\r\n \r\n15 08-57118 \r\n \r\nnuclear weapons test and launching ballistic missiles. \r\nThe Security Council made it clear in its resolutions \r\n1695 (2006) and 1718 (2006), which it adopted \r\nunanimously, that those acts constituted a clear threat \r\nto international peace and security. The sanctions \r\nimposed on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nhave the backing of the entire international community. \r\nIn order to remove the military threat it has created, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea must continue \r\nto make efforts towards full implementation of the \r\njoint statements of the Six-Party Talks of September \r\n2005. And the statement that our delegation made on \r\nthe draft resolution earlier today remains valid, which \r\nis to say that the nuclear development undertaken by \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is a threat \r\nto the peace and security, not only of Japan but also of \r\nEast Asia and the entire international community. And, \r\ntherefore, in order to solve this issue, Japan will \r\ncontinue to very sincerely pursue the settlement of this \r\nproblem. \r\n Mr. Sin Song Chol (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea) (spoke in French): The delegation \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea believes \r\nthat the Japanese delegation has not yet understood or \r\ngrasped the thrust of the statement that we made as an \r\nexplanation of position before the vote. In fact, it is our \r\nduty to make known to the international community \r\nwhat the attitude of Japan is to this nuclear problem. \r\nFor that purpose, my delegation would like to simply \r\nmention some specific cases that show clearly and \r\naccurately how Japan is trying in vain and futilely to \r\nhalt the process of the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Japan is now behaving very shamelessly in \r\ninsisting that it will not fulfil its commitment to make \r\neconomic compensation as agreed upon by the six \r\nparties at the Talks. Japan has never tried to implement \r\nthe issues discussed and agreed upon by the six parties \r\nbut has instead conducted hectic diplomacy to persuade \r\nthe United States not to cross the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea off its list of State sponsors of \r\nterrorism. Unfortunately, these efforts ended with an \r\nofficial announcement by the United States \r\nGovernment, removing the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea forever from the list. By insisting \r\nthat it will not participate in the aforementioned \r\neconomic compensation, Japan is deliberately \r\nneglecting and disturbing the October 3 agreement. It \r\nis the ulterior intention of Japan to create hurdles and \r\ncomplexities in the path of the Talks at any cost, in a \r\nbid to block resolution of the issue and steadily put \r\nstrain on the situation on the Korean peninsula.  \r\n The Japanese delegation has also mentioned the \r\nSecurity Council resolution, which, I would like to \r\nremind every delegation present in this Hall, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\ncategorically rejected. In order to understand the \r\nmotivation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea to reject that resolution, it is very important for \r\neveryone gathered here to understand what is at the \r\nroot of that so-called resolution. I would like to remind \r\nall delegations that that Security Council resolution is a \r\nproduct of the hostile United States policy toward the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. That is why \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\ncategorically rejected that resolution, which it \r\nconsiders a product of United States anti-Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea policies.  \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): I will be very brief. I would \r\nlike to draw the attention of the Members of the United \r\nNations to the statement that was just made by the \r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, in which it was stated that the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea rejected — I repeat, \r\nrejected — the Security Council resolutions, which \r\nwere adopted unanimously. And I think this says much \r\nabout the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s \r\nsincerity on this issue. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude \r\nits consideration of agenda item 80? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 105 \r\n \r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments \r\n \r\n (g) Appointment of members of the Committee  \r\non Conferences \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/107) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): As indicated \r\nin document A/63/107, since the terms of office of \r\nBurundi, El Salvador, France, Lesotho, Malaysia, the \r\nPhilippines and the Russian Federation will expire on \r\n31 December 2008, it will be necessary for the \r\nA/63/PV.32  \r\n \r\n08-57118 16 \r\n \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to appoint, during \r\nthe current session, seven members in order to fill the \r\nresulting vacancies. These members will serve for a \r\nperiod of three years, beginning on 1 January 2009.  \r\n After consultations with the Chairmen of the \r\nGroups of African States, Asian States, Eastern \r\nEuropean States and Western European and other \r\nStates, I have appointed the Congo, France, Malaysia, \r\nMozambique, the Philippines and the Russian \r\nFederation as members of the Committee on \r\nConferences for a period of three years, beginning on \r\n1 January 2009.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly takes \r\nnote of these appointments? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): Regarding the \r\nremaining vacant seat to be filled by a Latin American \r\nor Caribbean State, I will continue to hold \r\nconsultations with that regional Group. \r\n We have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (g) of agenda item 105. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 109 \r\n \r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the  \r\nUnited Nations \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now turn to agenda item 109 entitled \r\n“Implementation of the resolutions of the United \r\nNations”. It is my understanding that there is no \r\nrequest to consider this item at the present session. \r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to defer consideration of this item to the \r\nsixty-fourth session and to include it in the provisional \r\nagenda of the sixty-fourth session? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): This \r\nconcludes of our consideration of agenda item 109. \r\nThe meeting rose at 4.50 p.m. \r\n"
