(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 7 (continued) \r\n \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\n  Second report of the General Committee \r\n(A/63/250/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): In the first \r\nparagraph of its report, the General Committee decided \r\nto recommend to the General Assembly that an \r\nadditional item entitled “Recognition of sickle-cell \r\nanaemia as a public health priority” be included in the \r\nagenda of the current session under heading B, \r\n“Promotion of sustained economic growth and \r\nsustainable development in accordance with the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly and \r\nrecent United Nations conferences”. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include that item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading B? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): In paragraph \r\n1 (b), the General Committee further recommends that \r\nthe item be considered directly in plenary meeting. \r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to \r\nconsider that item directly in plenary meeting? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like \r\nto inform members that the item entitled “Recognition \r\nof sickle-cell anaemia as a public health priority” \r\nbecomes item 155 on the agenda of the current session. \r\n In paragraph 2 (a) of the report, the General \r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nan additional item entitled “Granting of observer status \r\nfor the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea in \r\nthe General Assembly” be included in the agenda of \r\nthe current session under heading I, “Organizational, \r\nadministrative and other matters”. May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides to include that item in the \r\nagenda of the current session under heading I? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): In paragraph \r\n2 (b), the General Committee further recommends that \r\nthe item be allocated to the Sixth Committee. May I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to allocate \r\nthe item to the Sixth Committee? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like \r\nto inform Members that the item entitled “Granting of \r\nobserver status for the International Fund for Saving \r\nthe Aral Sea in the General Assembly” has become \r\nitem 156 of the agenda of the current session. \r\n The Chairman of the Sixth Committee will be \r\ninformed of the decision just taken by the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n In paragraph 3 of the same report, the General \r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nitem 58 entitled “Report of the Human Rights Council” \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 2 \r\n \r\nbe considered in plenary meeting as well as in the \r\nThird Committee, on the understanding that the Third \r\nCommittee would consider and act on all \r\nrecommendations of the Human Rights Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, including those that deal with the \r\ndevelopment of international law in the field of human \r\nrights, without prejudice to the right of Member States \r\nto present draft resolutions and decisions on all issues \r\nconsidered in the report.  \r\n Taking into account this recommendation, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in plenary meeting, will consider \r\nthe annual report of the Human Rights Council on its \r\nactivities. It is also understood that the current \r\narrangement is in no way a reinterpretation of \r\nresolution 60/251 and will be reviewed before the \r\nbeginning of the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n May I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\napproves that recommendation? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Chairman \r\nof the Third Committee will be informed of the \r\ndecision just taken by the General Assembly. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of the second report of the General \r\nCommittee. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 66 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Court of Justice \r\n \r\n  Report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/63/4) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/229) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it \r\nthat the General Assembly takes note of the report of \r\nthe International Court of Justice?  \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): In connection \r\nwith this item, the Assembly also has before it a report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the Secretary-General’s \r\nTrust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement of \r\nDisputes through the International Court of Justice, \r\nwhich has been circulated in document A/63/229.  \r\n I call upon Ms. Rosalyn Higgins, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. \r\n Ms. Higgins: I am pleased to address the General \r\nAssembly today under the presidency of His \r\nExcellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, senior \r\nadviser on foreign affairs of Nicaragua. I warmly \r\ncongratulate you, President D’Escoto, on your election \r\nas President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session \r\nand wish you every success in that Office. \r\n This is the third time that I have had the privilege \r\nof addressing the General Assembly on the occasion of \r\nits consideration of the report (A/63/4) of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. The current report \r\ncovers the period 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008, a \r\nperiod of intense judicial activity. \r\n All 192 United Nations Members are, of course, \r\nipso facto parties to the Court’s Statute. Of those, 66 \r\nhave accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \r\nin accordance with article 36, paragraph 2, of the \r\nStatute. In addition, some 128 multilateral conventions \r\nand 166 bilateral conventions envisage that the Court \r\nwill be resorted to for the settlement of disputes arising \r\nfrom their application or interpretation. \r\n For the past two years, I have reported to the \r\nAssembly on the working methods that the Court has \r\nbeen applying to maximize its throughput — dealing \r\nwith always more than one case at a time, producing \r\njudgments in a timely fashion while never sacrificing \r\nquality, and clearing the backlog of cases ready for oral \r\nhearing. By applying those working methods, the Court \r\nhas been able to manage a very full schedule of cases \r\nas well as to be in a position to respond swiftly to \r\nunanticipated requests for the indication of provisional \r\nmeasures. \r\n Last year I informed the Assembly that the Court \r\nhad had a very productive year. This year I can inform \r\nthe Assembly that the Court has had the most \r\nproductive year in its history. It has handed down four \r\nsubstantive judgments and one order, on a request for \r\nthe indication of provisional measures. Another order \r\nfor provisional measures was given just two weeks \r\nago, falling technically outside of the period covered \r\nby the annual report but, of course, within the calendar \r\nyear. Furthermore, in that reporting period, the Court \r\nhas held hearings in four cases.  \r\n First, in December, it heard oral argument on the \r\nmerits in the case concerning sovereignty over Pedra \r\nBranca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South \r\nLedge (Malaysia/Singapore), delivering its Judgment \r\nin May. Secondly, in January, the Court completed \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n3 08-57795 \r\n \r\nhearings in the case concerning Certain Questions of \r\nMutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. \r\nFrance) and issued its Judgment in June. Thirdly, in \r\nMay, the Court heard oral argument on preliminary \r\nobjections in the case concerning Application of the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia). That Judgment \r\nis now under preparation. Fourthly, in June, the Court \r\nheld hearings on a request for the indication of \r\nprovisional measures submitted by Mexico within the \r\ncontext of a Request for Interpretation of the Judgment \r\nof 31 March 2004 in the Case concerning Avena and \r\nOther Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of \r\nAmerica). The Court issued its Order on provisional \r\nmeasures one month later. The Court is currently \r\ndeliberating on the underlying request for \r\ninterpretation. \r\n In addition, in September, the Court held hearings \r\non the merits in the case concerning Maritime \r\nDelimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine). \r\nThat case is under deliberation as well. In August, we \r\nreceived a new case, submitted by Georgia, concerning \r\nApplication of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \r\n(Georgia v. Russian Federation). Georgia also \r\nrequested provisional measures. Since the Court’s \r\nStatute provides that such requests have priority over \r\nall other proceedings, the Court held hearings in \r\nSeptember and issued its Order on provisional \r\nmeasures two weeks ago. \r\n The cases we have decided in the past year have \r\ninvolved States from every United Nations regional \r\ngroup: Asia, Africa, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, \r\nNorth America and Latin America. The Court thus \r\nmanifestly remains the court of the entire United \r\nNations. The universal character of the Court is also \r\nreflected in the subject matter of the past year’s cases, \r\nwhich has ranged from human rights to territorial \r\nsovereignty to mutual legal assistance to maritime \r\ndelimitation to interpretation of an earlier Judgment. \r\n In the past year, five new cases were submitted to \r\nthe Court: Maritime Dispute (Peru v. Chile); Aerial \r\nHerbicide Spraying (Ecuador v. Colombia); the \r\nRequest for Interpretation between Mexico and the \r\nUnited States, the Georgia v. Russian Federation case \r\nand the Assembly’s request for an advisory opinion on \r\nthe unilateral declaration of independence by the \r\nProvisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo. \r\nThe current number of cases on the docket stands at 14. \r\n Today, as is traditional, I will report on the \r\njudgments rendered by the International Court during \r\nthe reporting period. I will also briefly address the \r\nOrder on provisional measures issued two weeks ago. I \r\nshall deal with the decisions in chronological order. \r\n In October 2007, the Court handed down its \r\nJudgment in the case concerning Territorial and \r\nMaritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in \r\nthe Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Honduras), the \r\nhearings of which had been held in March 2007. The \r\ndispute concerned the maritime boundary between the \r\ntwo countries, as well as sovereignty over four cays in \r\nthe Caribbean Sea. In respect of sovereignty over the \r\nislands of Bobel Cay, Savanna Cay, Port Royal Cay \r\nand South Cay, located in the area in dispute, the Court \r\nconcluded that it had not been established that either \r\nHonduras or Nicaragua had title to those islands by \r\nvirtue of uti possidetis juris. Having then sought to \r\nidentify any post-colonial effectivités, the Court found \r\nthat sovereignty over the islands laid with Honduras, as \r\nit had shown that it had applied and enforced its \r\ncriminal and civil law, had regulated immigration, \r\nfisheries activities and building activity, and had \r\nexercised its authority in respect of public works there. \r\n As for the delimitation of the maritime areas \r\nbetween the two States, the Court found that no \r\nestablished boundary existed along the fifteenth \r\nparallel on the basis of either uti possidetis juris or a \r\ntacit agreement between the parties. It therefore \r\ndetermined the delimitation itself. In view of the \r\nparticular geographical circumstances of the area, it \r\nwas impossible for the Court to follow the preferred \r\npractice of establishing an equidistance line. The Court \r\nthus drew a bisector — that is to say, the line formed \r\nby bisecting the angle created by the linear \r\napproximations of the coastlines. The bisector method \r\nprovided the delimitation line with greater stability, as \r\nit was less affected by the changing nature of the \r\nparticular coastline.  \r\n It also greatly reduced the risk of error. The Court \r\nadjusted the course of the line to take account of the \r\nterritorial seas around the islands. The Court fixed the \r\nstarting point of the bisector at a distance of three \r\nnautical miles out to sea from an agreed point. The \r\nCourt instructed the parties then to negotiate in good \r\nfaith with a view to agreeing on the course of a line \r\nbetween the present agreed endpoint of the land \r\nboundary and the starting point of the maritime \r\nboundary thus determined. In respect of the endpoint of \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 4 \r\n \r\nthe maritime boundary, the Court stated that the line \r\nwhich it had drawn continued until it reached the area \r\nwhere the rights of certain third States might be \r\naffected. \r\n In December 2007, the Court decided another \r\ncase involving Nicaragua: Territorial and Maritime \r\nDispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia). This time, the case \r\nwas at the stage of preliminary objections. After \r\ncareful consideration of the parties’ arguments, the \r\nCourt found that the treaty signed by Colombia and \r\nNicaragua in 1928 settled the issue of sovereignty over \r\nthe islands of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa \r\nCatalina within the meaning of the Pact of Bogota, \r\ninvoked by Nicaragua as a basis of jurisdiction in the \r\ncase. There was no extant legal dispute between the \r\nparties on this question and the Court could not \r\ntherefore have jurisdiction on that point. On the other \r\nhand, as regards the question of the scope and \r\ncomposition of the rest of the San Andrés archipelago, \r\nthe Court considered that the 1928 treaty failed to \r\nprovide answers as to which other maritime features \r\nformed part of the archipelago.  \r\n The Court thus held that it had jurisdiction under \r\nthe Pact of Bogota to adjudicate on the dispute \r\nregarding sovereignty over those other maritime \r\nfeatures. As for its jurisdiction with respect to the \r\nmaritime delimitation area, the Court concluded that \r\nthe 1928 treaty and its 1930 protocol had not effected a \r\ngeneral delimitation of the maritime boundary between \r\nColombia and Nicaragua and that, as the dispute had \r\nnot been settled within the meaning of the Pact of \r\nBogota, the Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate upon \r\nit. The Court thus upheld Colombia’s preliminary \r\nobjections to its jurisdiction only insofar as they \r\nconcerned sovereignty over the islands of San Andrés, \r\nProvidencia and Santa Catalina. The Court has now set \r\ntime limits for the filing of the written pleadings on the \r\nmerits. \r\n In May 2008, the Court, sitting under the \r\npresidency of the Vice-President, delivered its \r\njudgment in a further case involving sovereignty over \r\nmaritime features, this time involving two States from \r\nAsia which had come to the Court by special \r\nagreement: Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu \r\nPuteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/ \r\nSingapore). The Court first indicated that the Sultanate \r\nof Johor, Malaysia’s predecessor, had had original title \r\nto Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, a granite island on \r\nwhich Horsburgh lighthouse stands. It concluded, \r\nhowever, that, by the date when the dispute \r\ncrystallized, 1980, title had passed to Singapore, as \r\nattested to by the conduct of the parties, in particular \r\ncertain acts performed by Singapore à titre de \r\nsouverain and Malaysia’s failure to react to \r\nSingapore’s conduct. \r\n The Court consequently awarded sovereignty \r\nover Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh to Singapore. As \r\nfor Middle Rocks, a maritime feature consisting of \r\nseveral rocks that are permanently above water, the \r\nCourt observed that the particular circumstances which \r\nhad led it to find that sovereignty over Pedra \r\nBranca/Pulau Batu Puteh rested with Singapore clearly \r\ndid not apply to Middle Rocks. It therefore found that \r\nMalaysia, as successor to the Sultanate of Johor, should \r\nbe considered to have retained original title to Middle \r\nRocks. Finally, with respect to the low-tide elevation \r\nSouth Ledge, the Court noted that it fell within the \r\napparently overlapping territorial waters generated by \r\nPedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh and by Middle Rocks. \r\nRecalling that it had not been mandated by the parties \r\nto delimit their territorial waters, the Court concluded \r\nthat sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the \r\nState in whose territorial waters it lies. \r\n After this series of territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes, the Court delivered a judgment in June in a \r\ncompletely different type of case: Certain Questions of \r\nMutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. \r\nFrance). This was the fist occasion it fell to the Court \r\nto pronounce on a dispute brought before it by an \r\napplication based on article 38, paragraph 5, of the \r\nRules of Court — forum prorogatum. This, of course, \r\nis when a State submits a dispute to the Court, \r\nproposing to found the Court’s jurisdiction upon \r\nconsent yet to be given or manifested by the State \r\nagainst which the application is made. So it will, I \r\nthink, attract much attention in the world of \r\ninternational law for that reason alone. \r\n In this case, France did give its consent in a letter \r\nto the Court, specifying that this consent was  \r\n “valid only for the purposes of the case, within \r\nthe meaning of Article 38, paragraph 5, i.e. in \r\nrespect of the dispute forming the subject of the \r\nApplication and strictly within the limits of the \r\nclaims formulated therein” \r\nby Djibouti. The parties disagreed as to exactly what \r\nFrance had agreed to. Reading Djibouti’s application \r\ntogether with France’s letter, the Court determined the \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n5 08-57795 \r\n \r\nextent of the mutual consent of the parties and resolved \r\nthat problem. \r\n The dispute before the Court concerned whether \r\nFrance had violated its obligations under the 1986 \r\nEuropean Convention on Mutual Assistance in \r\nCriminal Matters. In that Convention, judicial \r\ncooperation is envisaged, including the requesting and \r\ngranting of letters rogatory — usually the passing, for \r\njudicial purposes, of information held by a party. The \r\nConvention also provided exceptions to that envisaged \r\ncooperation. A key question was — given that at the \r\nend of the day the French judicial authorities declined \r\nto pass the requested case file — whether that refusal \r\nfell within the permitted exceptions.  \r\n Also at issue was whether France had, in other \r\nregards, complied with different provisions of the 1986 \r\nConvention. The Court held that the reasons given by \r\nthe French investigating judge for refusing the request \r\nfor mutual assistance fell within the scope of article \r\n2(c) of the Convention, which entitles the requested \r\nState to refuse to execute a letter rogatory if it \r\nconsiders that execution is likely to prejudice its \r\nsovereignty, its security, its ordre public or other of its \r\nessential interests. The Court did, however, conclude \r\nthat, as no reasons were given in the letter whereby \r\nFrance informed Djibouti of its refusal to execute the \r\nletter rogatory, France had failed to comply with its \r\ninternational obligation under article 17 of the 1986 \r\nConvention to provide reasons. \r\n In addition to those substantive judgments, the \r\nCourt has pronounced on two requests for provisional \r\nmeasures. In July, the Court ruled on a request for the \r\nindication of provisional measures submitted by \r\nMexico against the United States in connection with its \r\nRequest for Interpretation of the Judgment of 31 March \r\n2004 in the Case concerning Avena and Other Mexican \r\nNationals (Mexico v. United States of America).  \r\n In its order, the Court stated that the United \r\nStates was to take “all measures necessary” to ensure \r\nthat five Mexican nationals “are not executed pending \r\njudgment on the Request for interpretation” submitted \r\nby Mexico, “unless and until [they] receive review and \r\nreconsideration consistent with paragraphs 138 to 141 \r\nof the Court’s [Avena] Judgment”. The Court also held \r\nthat the United States was to inform it of “the measures \r\ntaken in implementation” of the order. The underlying \r\nrequest for interpretation is under deliberation and the \r\nCourt will be issuing a decision in the near future. \r\n A further request for an order on provisional \r\nmeasures came to the Court on 14 August 2008 in \r\nconnection with the case concerning Application of the \r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian \r\nFederation). The next day, acting in accordance with \r\nthe powers conferred by article 74, paragraph 4, of the \r\nrules of Court, I addressed an urgent communication to \r\nthe parties, calling upon them “to act in such a way as \r\nwill enable any order the Court may take on the request \r\nfor provisional measures to have its appropriate \r\neffects”.  \r\n The Court held three days of hearings in \r\nSeptember and issued its Order two weeks ago, \r\nrequiring both parties to, inter alia, do all in their \r\npower to ensure the security of persons, the right of \r\npersons to freedom of movement and residence and the \r\nprotection of property of displaced persons and of \r\nrefugees. The parties are also called upon to facilitate \r\nhumanitarian assistance. \r\n In February 2009, the Court’s composition will \r\nchange when the new members, elected by the General \r\nAssembly and Security Council voting simultaneously, \r\nwill take their place on the bench. Until that time, we \r\nare working hard on the preparation of our judgments \r\nin the Croatia v. Serbia, Mexico v. United States of \r\nAmerica and the Romania v. Ukraine cases. I am also \r\nglad to inform the Assembly that the Court has decided \r\nto open hearings in early March 2009 in the Dispute \r\nregarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica \r\nv. Nicaragua). Later in the year, we will hold hearings \r\nin the case concerning Pulp Mills on the River \r\nUruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay) and we will certainly \r\nbe giving appropriate attention to the Assembly’s \r\nrecent request for an advisory opinion on whether the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence by the \r\nProvisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo \r\nwas in accordance with international law. On \r\n17 October, we already issued an Order relating to \r\nprocedural steps in that matter. \r\n It will be recalled that last year I informed the \r\nAssembly that, due to a prodigious effort, we had \r\ncleared the backlog of cases that had built up over the \r\nyears, and I am pleased to report that the backlog \r\nremains clear. States thinking of coming to the Court \r\ncan be confident that as soon as they have finished \r\ntheir written exchanges, we will be able to move to the \r\noral phase in a timely manner. \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 6 \r\n \r\n Last year, the Court requested the creation of nine \r\nlaw clerk posts, a post for a senior legal officer in the \r\nDepartment of Legal Matters and a temporary post of \r\nindexer/bibliographer in the Library for the 2008-2009 \r\nbiennium. While the latter two posts were granted, for \r\nwhich the Court is grateful to the General Assembly, \r\nonly three of the nine law clerk posts were approved. \r\nYet they remain as necessary as ever in order to enable \r\neach judge to benefit from personalized legal support \r\nfor research, fact analysis and management of the case \r\nfile. The situation remains that the International Court \r\nof Justice is the only major international court or \r\ntribunal which does not have one law clerk assigned to \r\neach judge. The pace of work of the Court which has \r\nmade it possible, with difficulty, to ensure that States \r\nobtain justice without unreasonable delay, cannot be \r\nsustained without such assistance. \r\n In its budget submission for the 2010-2011 \r\nbiennium, the Court will therefore reiterate its request \r\nfor the creation of the six law clerk posts that have yet \r\nto be granted to it. Further, the Court would note that \r\nthe General Assembly has unfortunately not provided it \r\nwith the means to create an effective documents \r\ndivision by merging the Library and the Archives \r\nDivision, as we had been advised to. It will therefore \r\nresubmit the request for a post reclassification, which \r\nby itself would enable the Court to implement the \r\nmerger for the sake of greater productivity. \r\n The Court will also be requesting certain \r\nadditional new posts. It will seek funds for the \r\nreplacement and modernization of the conference \r\nsystems and the audio-visual equipment in its historic \r\ncourtroom, the Great Hall of Justice, which will be \r\nrenovated in cooperation with the Carnegie \r\nFoundation, the owner of the Peace Palace. The amount \r\nrequested will also cover the installation of the most \r\nup-to-date information technology on the judges’ bench \r\nand the tables occupied by the parties to cases. That \r\ntechnology is essential to enhancing communication \r\namong the judges and the parties during the oral \r\nhearings. It will facilitate the immediate sharing of data \r\nand documents and the clear display of maps and \r\nimages relevant to the case. The objective is to make \r\nthe Great Hall of Justice a courtroom that serves the \r\nprofessional needs of those who use it, bench and bar. \r\nNo court today can operate without those electronic \r\nfacilities. The principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations cannot work as a court with archaic facilities. \r\nIt is all part and parcel of greater efficiency. \r\n Under article 31 of the Statute, a party to a \r\ndispute before the Court, when no judge of that \r\nnationality is sitting on the bench, is entitled to \r\nnominate a judge ad hoc to serve in full equality for the \r\nduration of that case. \r\n Our heavy docket, combined with the wide array \r\nof States using the Court, means there has been a very \r\nsubstantial take up of that possibility. In relation to the \r\ncurrent docket, the Court has 20 judges ad hoc. Over \r\nthe past six years we have had 40 judges ad hoc. Of \r\ncourse, they perform admirable service while at the \r\nCourt. They receive the comparable daily rate of a \r\nregular judge for all work, together with travel and \r\nlodging. Judges ad hoc now represent 2 per cent of the \r\nCourt’s annual budget, and offices and secretarial \r\nsupport are also required for them. \r\n In the Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia) \r\ncase of 1999, neither party had a national on the bench \r\nand they informed the Court that they had jointly \r\nagreed not to appoint a judge ad hoc each, both having \r\nfull confidence in the Court as constituted in its regular \r\nmembership. Given the increasing percentage of \r\nInternational Court costs associated with judges ad \r\nhoc, the Court believes that where two States appear \r\nbefore it, neither of which has a national on the Bench, \r\nthey might want to give very careful consideration to \r\nwhat I will term the Botswana/Namibia model. \r\n I take this opportunity to note with appreciation \r\nthe decision of the General Assembly to meet the \r\nconcerns expressed by the Court during the year under \r\nreview with regard to resolution 61/262. The Court is \r\ngrateful to the Assembly for having resolved that \r\nmatter by its decision 62/547 of 3 April 2008. The \r\nprinciple of equality among judges, which is enshrined \r\nin our Statute and which, in turn, is annexed to the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, is central to our function as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations. We are \r\npleased to see that it has now been reaffirmed. \r\n The Court finds it of great importance that the \r\nproposed pension scheme for judges in service and for \r\nretired judges and their dependents should not lead to a \r\ndecrease in real terms. If, without further adjustments \r\nbeing in place, the pension would be calculated on the \r\nbasis of the annual net base salary, excluding post \r\nadjustment, a decrease in real terms would ensue. In \r\naddition, the Court notes that, notwithstanding its \r\nrepeated requests on this point, no mechanism is yet in \r\noperation to adjust effectively for cost-of-living \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n7 08-57795 \r\n \r\nincreases and fluctuations in the value of the United \r\nStates dollar. It therefore foresees the possibility of a \r\nfurther significant decline in the years ahead of the \r\npurchasing power of retired judges and their surviving \r\nspouses, in particular those residing in the euro zone. \r\nThe Court is counting on the understanding of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as to those points. \r\n The sheer number and variety of cases that have \r\nbeen entrusted to the International Court during the \r\nperiod under review affirm its role as the Court of the \r\nUnited Nations. Whether it is a complex case on \r\nmaritime delimitation with thousands of pages of \r\npleadings or an urgent request for provisional measures \r\nconcerning an ongoing conflict, States are turning to \r\nthe International Court for the peaceful settlement of \r\ntheir disputes. The Court greatly values the trust placed \r\nin it by the Members of the United Nations and, as \r\nalways, stands ready to play its role in attaining the \r\ncardinal principle of the Charter, the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n The President: I thank Judge Rosalyn Higgins, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for her \r\nexcellent and comprehensive report. I think that we all \r\nagree that the world Court is one of the organs of the \r\nUnited Nations about which we have every right to feel \r\nvery proud. I hope that we will find it within our means \r\nto provide the support that Judge Higgins has requested \r\nwith regard to a few lawyers to assist the judges. They \r\nare short-handed and the amount of work, as the \r\nAssembly has heard, is really immense. Once again, I \r\nthank Judge Rosalyn Higgins. \r\n Mr. Morrill (Canada): On behalf of Canada, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand (CANZ), I would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, for her excellent report \r\n(A/63/4) on the work of the Court over the past year. \r\n CANZ continues to strongly support the Court in \r\nits role as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. The diversity of cases before the Court, in \r\nboth subject matter and geographic circumstances, \r\ndemonstrates the universal character of the Court as \r\nwell as the unique role it plays in international justice. \r\nWe see that the cases referred to the Court are growing \r\nin factual and legal complexity and continue to include \r\ncutting-edge issues. CANZ appreciates that the \r\nsignificant workload of the Court requires it also to \r\njuggle urgent requests for indication of provisional \r\nmeasures while maintaining the forward momentum of \r\nother cases, including the consideration of preliminary \r\nmatters. \r\n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.  \r\n As we review the status of the Court for this year, \r\nwe see that once again the International Court has a \r\nfull caseload, with 14 cases formally pending. During \r\nthe past judicial year, the Court handed down four \r\njudgments and one order on a request for the indication \r\nof provisional measures, and held hearings in four \r\ncases. \r\n CANZ notes that the Judgment in the case \r\nconcerning Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in \r\nCriminal Matters (Djibouti v. France) is one of the few \r\nto have been decided by the Court on the basis of \r\nforum prorogatum, whereby the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt is founded on the conduct of the respondent \r\nState in relation to a unilateral application by another \r\nState. \r\n CANZ appreciates the ongoing efforts made by \r\nthe Court to increase its efficiency and sustain its \r\nincreased workload. CANZ also welcomes the \r\nincreased public accessibility to the work of the Court \r\nthrough its enhanced website, which now includes the \r\nentire jurisprudence of the Court as well as of its \r\npredecessor, the Permanent Court of International \r\nJustice. We recognize that, for the Court to continue \r\nthe consideration of several cases at the same time, \r\nregular replacement and modernization of \r\ntechnological systems and equipment is required. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n We also know that the Court has a very full \r\nagenda for the year ahead, as States continue to \r\nreaffirm their confidence in the Court’s ability to \r\nresolve their disputes. In that regard, we note that the \r\nCourt has already received two cases in the current \r\njudicial year, including the request by the General \r\nAssembly for an advisory opinion on Kosovo’s \r\nunilateral declaration. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n CANZ welcomes the vital role of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in the peaceful settlement \r\nof international disputes and in strengthening the \r\ninternational legal order as mandated by the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Wider acceptance of its \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction enables the Court to fulfil its \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 8 \r\n \r\nrole more effectively. Accordingly, we continue to urge \r\nMember States that have not done so to deposit with \r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations a \r\ndeclaration of acceptance of the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction. \r\n Finally, CANZ would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to express our deep appreciation and \r\nthanks to Judge Rosalyn Higgins for her tremendous \r\nleadership and contribution to the development of \r\ninternational law through her work as Judge and \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice. We wish \r\nher well in her future endeavours. \r\n Ms. Defensor-Santiago (Philippines): As this is \r\nthe first time that I take the floor during the current \r\nsession, allow me to convey my warmest felicitations \r\nto the President on his well-deserved election. I convey \r\nthe same sentiments to the Vice-Presidents, whose role \r\nthe President has made visible through effective \r\nteamwork and the sharing of responsibilities. With his \r\ndedication, commitment and spiritual zeal, and guided \r\nby the theme he has chosen for the sixty-third session, \r\nhis stewardship will be crowned with achievements \r\ndespite the grave crises the world is facing today. \r\n On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of the \r\nPhilippines, I am honoured and privileged to address \r\nthe General Assembly during its consideration of the \r\nreport of the International Court of Justice for the \r\nperiod 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008. Before turning \r\nto the report, my delegation wishes to commend Judge \r\nRosalyn Higgins, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, for her dedicated stewardship of the Court. \r\nHer term will end on 5 February 2009 and she will, no \r\ndoubt, leave a legacy that will further enhance the \r\nprestige and integrity of the Court. Her appointment as \r\nthe first woman member of the Court was itself an \r\nhistoric and significant event and we urge all Member \r\nStates to ensure that we maintain in the Court a policy \r\nof gender balance. \r\n My delegation commends the efforts of the Court \r\nto increase its efficiency, including the regular \r\nre-examination and review of its procedures and \r\nworking methods. These efforts have led to the \r\nsuccessful conduct of four hearings and the \r\npromulgation of an order on a request for the indication \r\nof provisional measures and have enabled the conduct \r\nof oral proceedings in the case concerning the maritime \r\ndelimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine) for \r\nthe judicial year 2008-2009. \r\n My delegation also commends the International \r\nCourt of Justice for the speed with which it acted on \r\nthe request submitted by Georgia for the indication of \r\nprovisional measures in the case concerning the \r\napplication of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \r\n(Georgia v. Russian Federation), as well as on the latest \r\nrequest of the General Assembly for an advisory \r\nopinion contained in resolution 63/3, dated 8 October \r\n2008, on the question of whether or not the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence by the Provisional \r\nInstitutions of Self-Government of Kosovo is in \r\naccordance with international law. \r\n My delegation has also taken due note of how the \r\nGeneral Assembly has contributed to sustaining the \r\nefforts of the Court aimed at streamlining its working \r\nmethods and making them more efficient by providing \r\nthe much-needed additional posts in the Court’s \r\nRegistry. The General Assembly’s response, in its \r\nresolution 61/262, to the Court’s concerns regarding \r\nconditions of service of members of the Court that \r\ncould lead to inequality and inequity, was also \r\nfavourable in this regard. The Philippines reiterates its \r\ncall for United Nations Member States to continue to \r\nprovide the Court with the necessary means to ensure \r\nits proper, effective and efficient functioning. \r\n The variety of cases pending before the Court, \r\ninvolving issues or controversies between States in \r\nEurope, Latin America and Africa, truly reflects the \r\nuniversality of the International Court of Justice. The \r\nPhilippines again registers its approval of the work \r\ndone by the Court aimed at making its decisions more \r\nwidely accessible to the public through the effective \r\nuse of the worldwide web. Making these decisions \r\nmore widely known will help strengthen the \r\nfoundations of, and enhance respect for, the rule of law \r\nand promote its effective implementation. \r\n The complexities of living in an increasingly \r\ninterdependent world indicate quite clearly the need to \r\nrely on the rule of law. The cases that are brought \r\nbefore the International Court of Justice demonstrate \r\nthe reality that, though territorial disputes are still the \r\nstaple of the Court, other complex or emerging issues, \r\nsuch as allegations concerning massive human rights \r\nviolations or the management of shared natural \r\nresources as a consequence of global interdependence, \r\nare now also being handled by the Court. \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n9 08-57795 \r\n \r\n The formal regime of jus ad bellum is long past, \r\nbut the new millennium has ushered in a reality of \r\narmed conflicts that demands our serious attention to \r\nethnic and religious differences. The civil strife and \r\nsocial cleavages that are involved in those conflicts \r\nrepresent the new challenges to international public \r\norder, enhancing the qualitative importance of \r\ninternational humanitarian law, which the Court itself \r\nhas referred to as “lex specialis” in parallel application \r\nwith international human rights law. \r\n The past few years have witnessed a steady rise \r\nin the number of States, entities and even individuals \r\nresorting to specialized tribunals and forums in an \r\nattempt to cope with the demands of increasing \r\ninterdependence. My delegation views this \r\ndevelopment not as a decline in confidence in the \r\nauthority of the International Court of Justice to \r\nadjudicate contentious legal issues, but as an increase \r\nin the reliance on the rule of law as a bulwark against \r\nbrutal force and war. Indeed, this development is a \r\nvisible demonstration of people’s faith in and respect \r\nfor the rule of law, which the International Court of \r\nJustice has unceasingly helped to propagate. In this \r\nregard, the Philippines is counting on the Court’s \r\nnorm-elucidation function to provide the basic \r\nframework of case law and norms for the guidance of \r\nthese specialized tribunals: a harmony of jurisprudence \r\nin general international law. \r\n The Philippines once again strongly affirms its \r\nunconditional support for the work of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and the invaluable role it plays in \r\npromoting an international legal order founded on the \r\nprimacy of the rule of law and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. As the principle judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations and, therefore, as the report under \r\nconsideration states, the only international court of a \r\nuniversal character with general jurisdiction, the Court \r\nis the primary institution invested with the duty and \r\nresponsibility to ensure respect for the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations.  \r\n In short, the increased workload of the Court \r\nheralds an increasing trust and confidence in the \r\nsupremacy of the International Court of Justice to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law, its universality and general \r\njurisdiction. These are salient features that augur well \r\nfor the future of the Court in particular and for a more \r\npeaceful and secure world in general. \r\n Mr. Voto-Bernales (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Rosalyn Higgins, for being with us \r\nthis morning and for her interesting and detailed \r\npresentation on the work carried out by the Court over \r\nthe past year. Once again, I am happy to congratulate \r\nher on her competence and leadership, which bolster \r\nthe high prestige enjoyed by the International Court of \r\nJustice. \r\n Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nestablished that States must seek to bring about the \r\nsettlement of international disputes by peaceful means \r\nand in conformity with the principles of justice and \r\ninternational law. This means then that the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes is established as a general \r\nprinciple of international law, whereby States must \r\nabstain from the use or threat of force. To bring these \r\nprinciples into effect, the International Court of Justice \r\nwas established; its Statute is integral to the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. The Court is the only international \r\nbody of a universal character with general jurisdiction. \r\nIts judgments put an end to legal disputes brought \r\nbefore it by States and help to build international \r\npeace. Furthermore, through its advisory opinions, the \r\nCourt contributes to the development of international \r\nlaw and to upholding of the rule of law. The juridical \r\nquality of its decisions, as well as its independence and \r\nimpartiality, has earned the Court a great legitimacy. \r\nThe proof is in the fact that, despite the sensitive nature \r\nof the disputes put before it — such as questions of \r\nterritorial limits, the exercise of jurisdiction and the \r\nsystem of immunities, among others — States have \r\npreferred to resort to the Court for the definitive \r\nresolution of those disputes. \r\n Peru’s commitment to the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is included in the 1948 \r\nAmerican Treaty on Pacific Settlement — the Pact of \r\nBogotá — whereby States parties agreed to always \r\nseek peaceful means of resolving disputes, among \r\nwhich is recourse to the Court. Peru has also \r\nrecognized, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article \r\n36 of the Statute of the Court, its contentious \r\njurisdiction. \r\n Consequently, Peru believes it is of the greatest \r\nimportance that the jurisdiction of the Court be \r\nuniversally accepted. In this regard, we appeal to States \r\nthat have not yet done so to accept the Court’s \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction in contentious cases. We States \r\nare obligated to comply with the Court’s decisions. \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 10 \r\n \r\nPeru, as a State that respects the international legal \r\norder, reiterates its commitment to fulfil its obligations \r\nflowing from the Statute of the Court and urges other \r\nStates to comply with its decisions. \r\n With regard to the contentious cases, the Court \r\nhas had a heavy load in the past year, with the \r\npresentation of four new cases, in one of which Peru is \r\na party. In this session, the General Assembly has also \r\nsubmitted a request for an advisory opinion. In addition \r\nto those new tasks, there are the cases pending, as well \r\nas the requests for provisional measures already \r\nsubmitted.  \r\n In affirming our full support for the Court, we \r\nshould at the same time recognize the distinguished \r\nwork of its judges. It is not only their high legal \r\nabilities that stand out, but also their managerial \r\nabilities, as the measures adopted to review procedures \r\nand working methods have increased their efficiency.  \r\n It is also appropriate to highlight the outreach \r\nwork that has been done, particularly with regard to the \r\nwebsite. It is an invaluable tool allowing access to \r\ninformation about the Court’s work. Peru trusts that the \r\narchives of audio-visual material of hearings will soon \r\nbe included in the website. \r\n States must ensure that the Court has sufficient \r\nresources to carry out the tasks entrusted to it. It must \r\nhave the necessary legal support staff and the means \r\nenabling it to manage the documentation required for \r\nits daily work. That will enable the Court to quickly \r\nresolve the disputes before it and to issue advisory \r\nopinions for the benefit of the international community. \r\nIn this regard, Peru supports, with complete conviction, \r\nthe reasonable requirements set out by the Court’s \r\nPresident, Judge Rosalyn Higgins.  \r\n Finally, a matter which must not escape the \r\nconcern of States is the high costs that a State must \r\nface in order to gain access to the Court. In some cases, \r\nthose costs can be an impediment to access. That is \r\nwhy the establishment of a Trust Fund has enabled \r\nStates to rely in part on financial assistance they need \r\nto carry out such a procedure. Peru therefore wishes to \r\nexpress its gratitude to those that have contributed to \r\nthe fund and joins with the appeal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to all States and bodies to cooperate with it. \r\n Ms. Kumari Singh Deo (India): At the outset, we \r\nthank the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, for her excellent \r\nintroduction of the report contained in document \r\nA/63/4. We welcome the opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the report of the Court. \r\n We commend President Higgins for her dedicated \r\nstewardship of the Court and for the Court’s impressive \r\nachievements over the period under review. That will \r\nno doubt further enhance the international community’s \r\nconfidence in this unique organ of international law, \r\nwhich has made a distinctive contribution to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n Over the last 60 years, the Court has dealt with a \r\nvariety of legal issues. Its judgments have covered \r\ndisputes concerning sovereignty over islands, \r\nnavigational rights of States, nationality, asylum, \r\nexpropriation, law of the sea, land and maritime \r\nboundaries, enunciation of the principle of good faith, \r\nequity and legitimacy of use of force. \r\n The issues presently before the Court are equally \r\nwide ranging, and its judgments have played an \r\nimportant role in the progressive development and \r\ncodification of international law. Despite the caution it \r\nhas exhibited and the sensitivity it has showed to the \r\npolitical realities and sentiments of States, the Court \r\nhas asserted its judicial functions and consistently \r\nrejected arguments to deny it jurisdiction on the ground \r\nthat grave political considerations were involved in a \r\ncase in which it otherwise found proper jurisdiction for \r\nitself. Thereby the Court clearly emphasized the role of \r\ninternational law in regulating inter-State relations, \r\nwhich are necessarily political. \r\n The advisory function of the Court contributes to \r\nclarifying law and removing ambiguities, thus assisting \r\nthe United Nations and its organs in carrying out the \r\nobjectives of the Organization. \r\n In recent years, the docket of the Court has grown \r\nsignificantly and it continues to enjoy universal \r\nsupport and respect. Another significant development \r\nthat needs to be welcomed is that, unlike in the past, \r\nwhen the jurisdiction phases of cases occupied most of \r\nthe Court’s time, the Court is now being frequently \r\ncalled upon to deal directly with a diversity of complex \r\nsubstantive issues of international law from all regions \r\nof the world. \r\n The year under review has been the most \r\nproductive in the Court’s history. It has handed down \r\nfour substantive judgments and two orders on requests \r\nfor the indication of provisional measures. Further, the \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n11 08-57795 \r\n \r\nCourt has held hearings in four cases and has three \r\njudgments under deliberation. That has been possible \r\ndue to the streamlining of the procedures and internal \r\nworking methods, which has led to scheduling of cases \r\nwithout significant delay. We appreciate the efforts of \r\nthe Court to eliminate the backlog. \r\n We also note that the Court’s request for nine law \r\nclerk posts was not agreed to. We hope that the General \r\nAssembly will be able to approve that request, as such \r\nassistance is critical, given the increasing number of \r\nfact-intensive cases. Judges of all other tribunals enjoy \r\nthat facility. The Court’s request for individualized \r\nlegal assistance for all its members is reasonable, and \r\ngranting it would enable the Court to carry out its \r\ndesignated functions more efficiently as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. \r\n The recent period has witnessed the creation of a \r\nnumber of specialized regional and international courts \r\nand bodies. Along with that development have come \r\nconcerns about the fragmentation of international law. \r\nThere is apprehension that similar legal issues or \r\ndisputes may well be subjected to final and binding \r\ninterpretations by two different bodies, with potentially \r\ndiffering views.  \r\n There is also considerable apprehension that the \r\nexpansion of the field has created problems not only of \r\ncoherence, but also of priority between different \r\ndispute settlement procedures. The challenge is to find \r\na balance between, on the one hand, the need for \r\ndiversity and specialized regimes and solutions, and, \r\non the other hand, the importance of maintaining an \r\noverall framework or system of international law that \r\noffers a sufficient degree of security and coherence. We \r\nwelcome the initiative taken by the President of the \r\nCourt aimed at regular dialogue between the \r\ninternational courts and tribunals and the exchange of \r\ninformation with a view to improving the unity of \r\ninternational law and addressing the problems of \r\noverlapping jurisdictions and the fragmentation of \r\ninternational law. \r\n The Court’s phenomenal docket explosion attests \r\nto the high standing of the Court not only in the United \r\nNations system, but in the international community \r\nitself. It also represents an affirmation of faith in the \r\nCourt. \r\n President Higgins will soon be completing her \r\nterm in the Court. We thank her immensely for her \r\nenormous and invaluable contributions to the work of \r\nthe Court and wish her the very best in her future \r\nendeavours. \r\n Ms. Negm (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I should like to express Egypt’s appreciation to \r\nJudge Rosalyn Higgins, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, for her valuable presentation of the \r\nreport of the International Court of Justice (A/63/4) on \r\nits work over the past year. I should also like to \r\nreaffirm Egypt’s conviction that the Court plays a \r\ncentral role in ensuring the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of international law, in settling disputes \r\nbetween countries and in providing advisory opinions \r\nto countries and international organizations to assist \r\nthem in carrying out their functions more effectively. \r\n Since its establishment, the Court has promoted \r\nimportant principles and rules of public international \r\nlaw through its advisory opinions on the legality of the \r\nthreat of use or the use of nuclear weapons and on the \r\nlegal consequences of the construction of the \r\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory, as \r\nwell as its judgments related to land and maritime \r\nboundary disputes, opinions and judgments that \r\ncontribute to the prevention of armed conflict \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n In that connection, the Egyptian delegation \r\nstresses the need to enhance the capacity of countries, \r\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies to \r\nrequest advisory opinions from the Court in important \r\ncases, because the Court’s opinions develop and codify \r\nthe rules of international law and consolidate the \r\nprinciples of justice and equality at the international \r\nlevel. Furthermore, their great moral and legal value \r\nassists in promoting international peace and security. \r\n If the United Nations reform process is to be \r\ncomprehensive and inclusive, it should include the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, which is one of the \r\nprincipal organs of the Organization. That would \r\nensure that the Organization is effective and can meet \r\nthe demands of today’s world, in particular since the \r\nprinciple of the rule of law now prevails both in \r\ninternational relations and at the national level. \r\n Although the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1) mandated the Member States to \r\nconsider means of strengthening the Court’s work, the \r\nUnited Nations has yet to discuss any initiatives or \r\nstudies in that regard. Therefore, we should take a clear \r\nposition and serious measures to enhance the Court’s \r\nrole and to make the best use of its legal capacities. For \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 12 \r\n \r\nits part, the Court should present its views on the \r\nadvancement of its legal and judicial roles. In that \r\nconnection, Egypt proposes that the General Assembly \r\nhold an informal interactive debate, led by its President \r\nand with the participation of the Court’s President and \r\nRegistrar, to identify the main problems preventing the \r\nCourt from operating as efficiently as possible, as well \r\nas proposals to overcome those problems. Such a \r\ndebate could take place after the Court has completed \r\nits ongoing review of its proceedings and working \r\nmethods, as mentioned in paragraph 18 of the report. \r\n In that context, the Egyptian delegation stresses \r\nthe need to benefit from the Court’s experiences in \r\nconsolidating established law related to the \r\nresponsibility of States to protect their citizens and \r\nrespect international law, whether through diplomatic \r\nprotection or consular relations, as well as abuse by \r\nStates of the principle of universality of specialized \r\njurisdiction, in contravention of the principle of the \r\nterritoriality of national laws, and differentiation \r\nbetween legitimate military struggle in pursuit of the \r\nright of self-determination, on the one hand, and \r\nterrorism, on the other.  \r\n Furthermore, it is essential that the Court render \r\nadvisory opinions on controversial issues arising from \r\nnew ideas being discussed in the corridors of the \r\nUnited Nations, whether they concern human rights, \r\ncontrol of natural resources or other issues being used \r\nas a pretext for interference in States’ internal affairs, \r\nin violation of the principles of international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The Egyptian \r\ndelegation expresses its appreciation for the Court’s \r\npioneering role in consolidating the principle of the \r\nrule of law. \r\n The Egyptian delegation commends the steps \r\ntaken by the Court to increase the efficiency of its \r\nwork so that it can keep abreast of its constantly \r\nincreasing workload. Egypt supports the Court’s \r\nrequest for the creation of six new law clerk posts from \r\nthe regular budget and for the resources needed to \r\nestablish an effective documents division by merging \r\nthe Library and Archives divisions. Egypt also supports \r\nthe idea of providing the Office of the Registrar with \r\nthe necessary resources and of modernizing the Court’s \r\ntechnology to promote greater productivity. In \r\naddition, it is important that we effectively address the \r\nissues related to the pension scheme for current and \r\nretired judges. The Egyptian delegation will work with \r\nother countries in the Fifth Committee to meet those \r\ndemands, in particular because they have come at a \r\ntime of increasing international efforts to enhance the \r\nOrganization’s role and capacity to carry out its \r\nmandate, in accordance with international legitimacy, \r\nto maintain the public international order, as agreed \r\nwhen the United Nations was established.  \r\n Finally, the Egyptian delegation expresses its \r\ngratitude to all the Court’s judges, its Registrar and its \r\nemployees for their efforts over the past year. We wish \r\nthem every success in fulfilling the Court’s aspired role \r\nin the future. \r\n Mr. Amil (Pakistan): First, I would like to thank \r\nHer Excellency Judge Roslyn Higgins, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for the excellent report \r\nthat she presented to the Assembly on the work of the \r\nCourt during the past year (A/63/4). The report \r\nadequately covers matters related to the Court’s \r\nfunctioning as well as substantive judicial issues \r\nrelated to the Court’s work. \r\n The need for the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\ncould never have been felt more seriously than at the \r\npresent time. It has been mandated by the development \r\nand progress of human society, as well as by the havoc \r\nwrought upon human society by the frequent use of \r\nforce by State and non-State actors. It is through the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention \r\nthat we could ensure justice, equality and peace in our \r\nworld. \r\n The International Court of Justice, as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, provides \r\nMember States and United Nations organs with the best \r\nplatform for that endeavour. It is an international court \r\nof a universal character, with twofold general \r\njurisdiction.  \r\n In the first place, it decides upon disputes freely \r\nsubmitted to it by States in the exercise of their \r\nsovereignty. One hundred ninety-two States are parties \r\nto the Statute of the Court, 66 of which have also \r\naccepted the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. Pakistan \r\nis a party to the Statute and has accepted the Court’s \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction. Additionally, more than 300 \r\nbilateral and multilateral treaties provide for the Court \r\nto have jurisdiction in the settlement of disputes arising \r\nout of interpretation of those treaties. The Court also \r\nenjoys jurisdiction in forum prorogatum situations. \r\n The Court is playing a valuable role as far as its \r\nhandling of cases related to its primary jurisdiction is \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n13 08-57795 \r\n \r\nconcerned. We are happy to note that the number of \r\ncases decided by the Court during the past 10 years has \r\nsubstantially increased compared with the previous \r\n10-year period through efficient handling of the cases \r\nbrought before the Court. However, the problem comes \r\nfrom the States that are reluctant to accept the Court’s \r\njurisdiction in the area of dispute settlement owing to \r\nthe weakness of their cases or to other political \r\nconsiderations. We hope that, with the passage of time, \r\neven those who are reluctant today will move forward \r\nand accept the Court’s jurisdiction for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention. \r\n The Court’s second type of jurisdiction is that of \r\nadvisory opinion, in accordance with article 69 of its \r\nStatutes, which covers consultations by the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council on legal questions \r\narising within the scope of their activities. In the recent \r\npast, more cases of the use of force under Chapter VII \r\nof the Charter were noted, as compared to the referral \r\nof disputes to the Court for peaceful resolution under \r\nparagraph 3, Article 36 of Chapter VI of the Charter. \r\nThe United Nations Charter recognizes in Article 1 that \r\nsettlement of international disputes “by peaceful \r\nmeans, and in conformity with the principle of justice \r\nand international law” is one of the basic purposes of \r\nthe United Nations. Chapter VI of the Charter offers \r\nvast possibilities for the United Nations and its organs \r\nto play an important role in the pacific settlement of \r\ndisputes. We strongly believe that better utilization of \r\nthe Court for the peaceful settlement of disputes and \r\nconflict prevention will serve as the basis for the long-\r\nterm peaceful coexistence of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n We are happy to note that the Court has handed \r\ndown judgments on three important cases. The Court’s \r\njudgment in the case concerning Territorial and \r\nMaritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in \r\nthe Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Honduras) is helpful \r\nin understanding the Court’s approach to the difficult \r\nlegal questions. The Court was to decide the \r\nsovereignty of Nicaragua or Honduras over the islands \r\nof Bobel Cay, Savanna Cay, Port Royal Cay and South \r\nCay. It was important to note that the Court first \r\nwanted to base its decision on the principle of uti \r\npossidetis juris. The Court sought to identify any post-\r\ncolonial effectivités after it concluded that the title of \r\nthe islands could not be established by virtue of uti \r\npossidetis juris. We are of the view that this approach \r\ncould help settle disputes related to small islands and \r\nthat the decision should not serve as a general \r\nprecedent for the handling of such cases. \r\n The Court also handed down its judgment in the \r\ncase concerning Territorial and Maritime Dispute \r\n(Nicaragua v. Colombia). The case was related to the \r\nobligation of parties under treaties and the interpretation \r\nof treaties. It also highlighted the willingness of \r\nNicaragua and Colombia to settle these disputes through \r\npeaceful means. The Court’s judgment in the case \r\nconcerning sovereignty in the Malaysia/Singapore case \r\nwas also an important outcome. We have noted that \r\nmany aspects of the Court’s judgment in these cases \r\nwere put to vote and had to be decided on the basis of a \r\nmajority decision. We have been carefully studying \r\nthese judgments and their precedent-setting implications \r\non international law. \r\n We have noted with appreciation that the Court \r\nhas been systematically and regularly re-examining its \r\nongoing proceedings and work methods. The Court’s \r\nefforts to enhance its productivity, especially through \r\nregular meetings devoted to strategic planning of its \r\nwork are praiseworthy. We have also noted that the \r\nCourt has set for itself a particularly demanding \r\nschedule of hearings and deliberations and has cleared \r\nthe backlog of cases. We appreciate the Court’s \r\nassurance to Member States that oral proceedings on \r\nthe cases can now be started in a timely manner, \r\nimmediately after finishing the written exchanges. \r\n The international legal institutions, especially the \r\nInternational Court of Justice have an important role in \r\ndefining and implementing justice and rule of law in \r\ntoday’s world. The principles of peaceful coexistence \r\nand respect for basic human rights can only be ensured \r\nthrough respect for the rule of law and justice. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice, through its impartial and \r\nindependent decisions, could contribute to a rule-of-\r\nlaw-based international society. However, it is the \r\nwillingness of Member States, General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council that will play pivotal role in \r\ndefining and promoting a rule-of-law-based \r\ninternational legal system. \r\n Mr. Bula-Bula (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): The delegation of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has carefully \r\nstudied the report presented to the General Assembly \r\nby the President of the International Court of Justice \r\ncovering the period from 1 August 2007 to 31 July \r\n2008. During this period we note that the Court has \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 14 \r\n \r\ndealt with 15 cases. The delegation of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo will offer observations on the \r\nfour following subjects that relate to eight judicial \r\ndecisions of great interest: Firstly, emerging \r\njurisprudence relating to the environmental rights and \r\nthe right to development; secondly, decisions relating \r\nto applications against State organs; thirdly, matters \r\nrelating to international peace and security and lastly, \r\ncases relating to consular rights. \r\n It would seem, to my delegation, somewhat \r\nunnecessary to dwell on conventional jurisprudence \r\nrelating to the law of the sea, although some who have \r\nbrought applications to the Court have remained \r\nunsatisfied. A similar fate indeed awaits the Diallo case \r\nrelating to diplomatic protection, a remnant of the past \r\nthat archaeologists in the legal arena seek to excavate, \r\nindulging in ideological speculation about a so-called \r\ndiplomatic protection by substitution, which is \r\nunknown in contemporary international law. There is \r\nstill time for the parties to spare the international \r\njudges from having to hear this case, for, as Charles \r\nRousseau said, they are far removed from the many \r\ndomestic laws relating to this unfortunate \r\nmisunderstanding between the parties. \r\n We are grateful to the Court, and particularly the \r\nPresident of the Court, for having so quickly made real \r\nprogress in maximizing its throughput. \r\n The Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case (Hungary \r\nv. Slovakia), the Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay \r\n(Argentina v. Uruguay) and the Aerial Herbicide \r\nSpraying case (Ecuador v. Colombia) are three rulings \r\nwhich, apart from providing a solution for the parties, \r\nrelate to the law of the environment, which is so closely \r\nlinked to the right to sustainable development. \r\n The Court has a duty to ensure balance between \r\nenvironmental and developmental considerations. Did \r\nthe international judge know, at the time of taking that \r\ninitial decision on 25 September 1997, that he was \r\nestablishing a very fruitful precedent for cases brought \r\nbefore the Court and perhaps also for advisory \r\nopinions sought in the future, for example, on climate \r\nchange and who knows what else? \r\n The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ \r\nRights for the first time enshrined the right to \r\ndevelopment and environmental rights, and is now part \r\nof general international law. By recognizing that its \r\ndecisions are long term, the International Court of \r\nJustice should and does know that, with the \r\nGabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, it has opened up a \r\nnew chapter in jurisprudence, the main idea being the \r\nright to development of the individual, of peoples, of \r\nStates, of humanity, spanning space and time as \r\nMr. Dupuy has said. \r\n Following the case of the arrest warrant of \r\n11 April 2000, there has been a tendency to bring \r\ncriminal complaints against the organs of the State to \r\nthe Court, namely the case concerning Certain criminal \r\nproceedings in France (Republic of Congo v. France); \r\nand Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in \r\nCriminal Matters (Djibouti v. France). That case is \r\ntherefore still pending before the Court. However, the \r\nfindings of the judgment handed down on 4 June 2008 \r\nin the case concerning Certain Questions of Mutual \r\nAssistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France), \r\ntwo and a half years after the case was submitted on \r\n9 January 2006, does not appear to have addressed the \r\nissue of the immunity of organs of a foreign State, \r\nwhich is not to be confused with impunity.  \r\n The case concerning Avena and Other Mexican \r\nNationals (Mexico v. United States of America) is \r\nsimilar to the historic LaGrand case (Germany v. \r\nUnited States of America). Avena has to do with the \r\nviolation of consular rights. As we know, in that case \r\nthe Court said that orders for provisional measures \r\nunder article 41 of its Statute were mandatory. Such \r\nmeasures entail legal consequences for parties that do \r\nnot implement them. Unfortunately, however, that did \r\nnot happen in the case of the order issued on \r\n5 February 2003, which has not been implemented. A \r\nyear and a half after they were issued, with the \r\nInternational Court acknowledging that they were \r\nbinding, the mandatory nature of provisional measures \r\nmust not be allowed to become a dead letter. At stake is \r\nthe credibility of the Court’s decisions — a fortiori, in \r\nthis case, the effective implementation of the 31 March \r\n2004 judgment. The jurisprudence emanating from the \r\nLaGrand case must be safeguarded. \r\n The case concerning Armed Activities on the \r\nTerritory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo v. Uganda) entails an extreme example of what \r\nArticle 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United \r\nNations referred to as the  \r\n“use of force against the territorial integrity or \r\npolitical independence of any State, or in any \r\nother manner inconsistent with the purposes of \r\nthe United Nations”. \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n15 08-57795 \r\n \r\n That case, which was decided by the judgment of \r\n19 December 2005, overruled the 1949 case of the \r\nCorfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland v. Albania), the 1986 Nicaragua case \r\nand the 2003 case involving oil platforms. Although, as \r\nsome have rightfully pointed out, the decisions of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice could have been more \r\nprecise in their findings, they are no less well \r\nestablished, regardless of the wording employed. In \r\nthat regard, it is important to read the entire judgment \r\ncarefully, especially paragraphs 153, 304 and 345. \r\nGiven the friendly relations of cooperation that are \r\ngradually being restored between the two former \r\nbelligerents, the delegation of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo expects that the matter of compensation \r\nwill be justly, equitably and speedily resolved through \r\nthe means prescribed by the judgment of 19 December \r\n2005.  \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a State \r\nthat is unique in having brought five cases to the Court \r\nin the period of a decade and has made an enormous \r\ncontribution to the effectiveness of international \r\njudicial settlement and therefore to that of the main \r\nlegal organ of the United Nations. The delegation of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, its Government \r\nand its national group on the Permanent Court of \r\nArbitration believe that, as a State that has so amply \r\ndemonstrated that it believes in the rule of law and \r\nrespects international law — sometimes as applicant \r\nState and others as respondent — our country has built \r\nup a wealth of experience that it would like to share \r\nwith the international community. That is the \r\nunderlying motivation for the first candidacy submitted \r\nby the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, namely, my own modest \r\ncandidacy, as a former ad hoc Judge of the Court, for \r\nthe elections to be held on 6 November 2008. That \r\ncandidacy, which fully meets all of the requirements \r\nfor professionalism and high moral character, also \r\ncontributes to striking a perfect balance at the Court in \r\nline with the provisions of articles 2 and 9 of the \r\nStatute, regarding the world’s main forms of \r\ncivilization and the practice legal systems, as well as \r\nthe practice of equitable geographic rotation.  \r\n Those are the comments that the delegation of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo wanted to make \r\nwith regard to the serious, clear and well-organized \r\nreport that has been submitted by the Court.  \r\n Mr. Appreku (Ghana): My delegation wishes to \r\nthank to Her Excellency the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Dame Rosalyn Higgins, \r\nfor introducing the report (A/63/4) on the role and \r\nfunctioning of the Court during the period under \r\nreview. We also wish to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report (A/63/229). \r\n As this happens to be the last time that Judge \r\nHiggins may be addressing the General Assembly in \r\nher capacity as President and Judge of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, my delegation wishes to place on \r\nrecord Ghana’s deep appreciation for Judge Higgins’ \r\ndistinguished contribution to the renaissance in the \r\nworking methods of the Court, thus helping to lift the \r\nimage of the Court as an indispensable judicial organ \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of international disputes. \r\n Thanks to the prodigious efforts of President \r\nHiggins and the other judges of the Court, the record \r\nshows that a growing number of States are turning to \r\nthe International Court of Justice as the pre-eminent \r\njudicial forum to which States may refer the resolution \r\nof their legal disputes in accordance with the principles \r\nof justice and international law. The confidence of \r\nStates parties to the Statute of the Court — even for \r\nStates that have yet to accept the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction — is further expressed in the number of \r\ntreaties and other international agreements, including \r\nthose to which Ghana is party, that contain provisions \r\nfor the settlement of disputes by the Court in the event \r\nof a failure in the processes of negotiations, mediation, \r\nconciliation or arbitration. \r\n As a result of the varied nature of cases that the \r\nCourt is called upon to adjudicate — ranging from the \r\ntraditional areas of disputes concerning territorial \r\nclaims and the treatment of nationals to cutting-edge \r\nissues such as allegations of massive violations of \r\nhuman rights — the Court is significantly defining and \r\nrefining the rules that should govern the behaviour of \r\nStates, nations and individuals. The Court’s influence \r\nis increasingly being felt in fields such as international \r\nhuman rights and humanitarian law, as well as with \r\nregard to laws about the environment, shared natural \r\nresources and diplomatic and consular relations, thus \r\nmaking an invaluable contribution to the codification \r\nand progressive development of international law. \r\n At the global level in general, and in Africa in \r\nparticular, there is a happy coincidence in the \r\ndecreasing incidence of armed conflicts that were \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 16 \r\n \r\nprevalent over the past decade and the increasing \r\nnumber of cases of disputes that have been submitted \r\nto the courts for peaceful resolution, many of which \r\ninvolve African States as parties. According to the \r\nreport before us, during the period under review, the \r\nregional diversity of the cases that came before the \r\nCourt from the world over reflected its universality.  \r\n Ghana notes with satisfaction that regular \r\ndialogue between the Court and other international \r\ntribunals such as the International Criminal Court and \r\nthe ad hoc Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, \r\nRwanda and Sierra Leone, among others, ensures the \r\npromotion of universality, not only in regional or \r\ngeographical terms, but also in terms of jurisprudence. \r\nGhana would also urge that dialogue between the \r\nInternational Court and the newly created regional and \r\nsubregional courts in Africa be encouraged in order to \r\nstrengthen capacity-building and deepen the rule of law \r\nat the regional and subregional levels. \r\n Ghana believes that the Court’s endeavours to \r\nuphold the principles of the strict equality of parties \r\nand due process, as well as its own impartiality, \r\nindependence and judicial integrity, have contributed in \r\nno small measure to inspiring renewed confidence in \r\nthe Court.  \r\n Besides its role as an avenue for the settlement of \r\ndisputes through peaceful means, the Court’s role in \r\nconflict prevention through the promotion of respect \r\nfor the rule of law cannot be underestimated. It should \r\nbe recalled that a recent assessment by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report to both the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council indicated that it is much less \r\nexpensive to prevent armed conflicts than to resolve \r\nthem. Ghana therefore believes that no effort should be \r\nspared to meet the request contained in the Court’s \r\nreport for adequate human and material resources, \r\nincluding the recruitment of the requisite number of \r\nlaw clerks, in order to enable the Court, with the \r\nsupport of its Registry, to handle more effectively and \r\nexpeditiously its cases, which, according to its report, \r\nare growing in factual and legal complexity. \r\n The need for adequate funding of the Court \r\nbecomes even more urgent, given that a significant \r\nnumber of cases have direct or indirect bearing on the \r\nthree pillars of the United Nations agenda, namely \r\npeace and security, human rights and development, \r\nwhich are essentially interwoven and interdependent, \r\nas neither of them can be pursued without the other, \r\nnor can any one of them be realized without justice \r\nbeing anchored in the rule of law. \r\n Ghana also welcomes steps taken by the Court \r\nnot only to improve the quality of justice but also to \r\nensure greater accountability in the management of \r\nbudgetary resources through the reporting mechanism, \r\nunder which the Registrar reports more frequently to \r\nthe Budget and Finance Committee of the Court. \r\n My delegation recognizes the contribution of the \r\nSecretary-General’s Trust Fund in facilitating access to \r\nthe Court by less-endowed States. Ghana commends \r\nthe Court’s open-door policy, which allows all people, \r\nincluding political leaders, scholars and students alike, \r\nto visit the Court’s premises, and facilitates access to \r\ninformation about the work of the Court through the \r\nInternet, thus helping to demystify the law and \r\nenhancing the Court’s legitimacy and authority in the \r\nworld. Ghana will continue to do whatever it can to \r\nsupport the noble work of the International Court of \r\nJustice for the advancement of the rule of law \r\neverywhere. \r\n Finally, my delegation would like to congratulate \r\nMs. Rosalyn Higgins for her distinguished record as \r\nJudge and President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. We wish her the very best in all her future \r\nendeavours. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like, first of all, to express my thanks to Judge \r\nRosalyn Higgins for her eloquent presentation of the \r\nannual report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/63/4). She has painted a detailed picture of the \r\nachievements and the active role that the Court \r\ncontinues to play under the Charter of the United \r\nNations, specifically the promotion of the ideals of law \r\nthrough the peaceful settlement of disputes, the \r\nnon-recourse to the use of force, the promotion of \r\ninternational law and the primacy of the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations. \r\n In the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document, \r\nour heads of State and Government forcefully \r\nreaffirmed the obligation of States to settle their \r\ndisputes by peaceful means in accordance with Chapter \r\nVI of the Charter and, when appropriate, to bring them \r\nbefore the International Court of Justice. \r\n The judgments of the Court over more than six \r\ndecades have dealt with a very varied set of disputes. \r\nThe judgments of the Court and its advisory opinions \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n17 08-57795 \r\n \r\nhave significantly contributed to increased respect for \r\ninternational law, as well as to its progressive \r\ncodification. \r\n The factual and legal diversity and complexity \r\nand the increasing number of cases brought before the \r\nCourt clearly display the increased confidence of a \r\nwide range of parties in the jurisdiction, impartiality \r\nand independence of this institution.  \r\n Algeria welcomes the judgments handed down by \r\nthe Court during the year 2007-2008 in the case of the \r\nterritorial and maritime dispute in the Caribbean Sea \r\nbetween Nicaragua and Honduras, the territorial and \r\nmaritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia, the \r\nsovereignty of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle \r\nRocks and South Ledge between Malaysia and \r\nSingapore, and in the case pertaining to mutual \r\nassistance in criminal matters between Djibouti and \r\nFrance. The Court has also ruled on the request for \r\nprovisional measures submitted by Mexico with regard \r\nto a request for interpretation of the judgment handed \r\ndown by the Court on 31 March 2004 in the case of \r\nAvena and other Mexican nationals. \r\n This kind of result is undoubtedly due to the \r\nintense efforts by the judges despite the logistical \r\ndifficulties pointed out on numerous occasions by the \r\nsuccessive Presidents of the Court in their reports. It is \r\nregrettable that the principal judicial body of the \r\nUnited Nations continues to suffer from a lack of \r\nbudgetary resources. The budgetary requests expressed \r\nby the Court have only been partially satisfied. \r\nMember States, by means of the General Assembly, \r\nmust make available to the Court the human and \r\nfinancial means that will allow it to carry out its \r\nmission. \r\n We would like here to congratulate the Court for \r\nits ongoing endeavours to improve its procedures and \r\nworking methods and increase its productivity, in \r\nparticular by holding regular strategic planning \r\nmeetings. This display of dynamism and self-discipline \r\nhas made it possible for the Court to clear its backlog, \r\nwhich is something we must welcome. \r\n Judge Higgins has reminded us of the many cases \r\nthat the Court has examined and the judgments and \r\nopinions issued since it was created. Respect for and \r\nimplementation of the judgments it has issued are of \r\ncapital importance for the parties concerned and for the \r\nentire international community. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations entrusted the Security Council with a \r\nrole in that area. \r\n With regard to another important aspect of the \r\nCourt’s activities — the advisory opinions rendered by \r\nthis principal judicial organ of the United Nations — \r\nmy delegation believes that they are not merely points \r\nof view, but rather reaffirmations of principles of \r\ninternational law and contributions to its enrichment \r\nand development. At a time when the primacy of \r\ninternational law is being reaffirmed more and more \r\neach day because of the growing complexity of \r\ninternational relations, we believe that advisory \r\nopinions should be taken into consideration by all \r\nMember States and, first and foremost, by the principal \r\nUnited Nations organs, in particular the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council.  \r\n The Court’s opinions must not remain dead \r\nletters. In particular, the recent opinion on the legal \r\nconsequences of the construction of the wall of \r\nseparation in the occupied Palestinian territory \r\nenshrines the principle of the inadmissibility of \r\nacquiring land by force and must be taken into account \r\nby the principal United Nations organ responsible for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nMember States must continue to have recourse, \r\nthrough various United Nations organs, to the Court’s \r\njurisdiction by requesting advisory opinions on issues \r\ninvolving or concerning them — as the General \r\nAssembly did on the issue of Kosovo’s unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence. Such requests will \r\nundoubtedly enrich the Court’s jurisprudence and \r\nensure that the principles and ideals promoted by the \r\nCharter’s authors will prevail.  \r\n Finally, we wish to reaffirm once again our \r\nsupport for the role of the International Court of Justice \r\nand our confidence in its members, who have been \r\nfaithfully represented by the presidency of Judge \r\nHiggins. While we wish her a very enjoyable and well-\r\ndeserved retirement, we are convinced that she will \r\ncontinue to serve justice. \r\n Mrs. Miculescu (Romania): Let me start by \r\nexpressing Romania’s appreciation for the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (A/63/4), which is — as it \r\nis every year — comprehensive and enlightening as to \r\nthe complex activities carried out by the Court. Our \r\ncongratulations go to the Honourable Judge Rosalyn \r\nHiggins, President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nand all members of the Court on their outstanding work. \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 18 \r\n \r\n The report proves once more that the International \r\nCourt of Justice is pivotal in strengthening respect for \r\ninternational law by resolving the disputes submitted to \r\nit by States in accordance with the relevant norms. My \r\ncountry is deeply devoted to conducting its \r\ninternational relations on the basis of full observance of \r\ninternational law and is committed to settling all \r\ndisputes exclusively by peaceful means. In that respect, \r\nRomania attaches great importance to the crucial role \r\nplayed by the International Court of Justice in \r\npromoting the rule of law in international relations. \r\n That is clearly proved by the fact that Romania \r\nbrought before the Court the issue of maritime \r\ndelimitation concerning the continental shelf and the \r\nexclusive economic zones of Romania and Ukraine in \r\nthe Black Sea. We did so only after a long and intense \r\nnegotiation process and after it had become obvious \r\nthat the bilateral talks on that issue could not lead to a \r\nmutually agreed solution within a reasonable period of \r\ntime. The decision to bring that matter before the Court \r\nrepresented our clear recognition of the Court’s \r\nprofessionalism and, in particular, its extensive \r\nexpertise in the field of maritime delimitation. It was \r\nalso an expression of our full confidence in the \r\nimpartiality of the principal legal organ of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The most recent development in the case, namely, \r\nthe hearings that took place in September in The \r\nHague, occurred after the period covered by the report. \r\nWe are now expecting the delivery of the judgment. \r\nLet me stress that Romania is extremely satisfied at the \r\nswift development of the proceedings in this case and \r\nhighly appreciates the efforts of all the Court services \r\nthat were involved. In that context, I would like to \r\nexpress our gratitude for the very effective and \r\ncourteous assistance provided by the Registry in all \r\nprocedural matters. \r\n Romania is fully confident that the Court will find \r\nan equitable solution with regard to the delimitation of \r\nthe maritime spaces of the two countries through \r\ncorrect application of the relevant international law and \r\nthe method developed by the Court in its well-\r\nestablished jurisprudence on the matter. It goes without \r\nsaying that Romania is committed to complying with \r\nthe decision taken by the Court. We are pleased that \r\nUkraine has also stated its commitment to abide by the \r\njudgment rendered. Those pledges are, I believe, a \r\ndemonstration of maturity and also of the friendly \r\nrelations that our two countries enjoy. \r\n Furthermore, our confidence in the Court, as well \r\nas our ongoing support for its activities, were \r\ndemonstrated by our positive vote requesting an \r\nadvisory opinion of the Court with respect to the \r\nconformity with international law of the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence by Kosovo’s Provisional \r\nInstitutions of Self-Government. Romania also notes \r\nwith appreciation the Court’s activities in the other \r\ncases mentioned in the report, given that the Court’s \r\nworkload has increased considerably in recent years. It \r\nis reassuring to see that the Court has been successful \r\nin maintaining the high standards of legal rigour and \r\nclarity that have always characterized its work. It is \r\nnoteworthy that the judgments rendered by the Court \r\nduring the period under review addressed many \r\nimportant points of law, ranging from the method to be \r\napplied in maritime delimitation to the immunities \r\nenjoyed by State officials. Romania wishes to \r\nacknowledge the significant contribution that those \r\njudgments by the Court make to the development of \r\ninternational law by reinforcing, refining and further \r\nenriching the long-established rules of international \r\nlaw. \r\n I now turn to the future. A look at the Court’s \r\ncurrent docket shows that many new challenges lie \r\nahead. The Court will have to deal with additional \r\ncomplex cases regarding matters of great importance, \r\nboth for the States directly concerned and for the \r\ninternational community. That shows the international \r\ncommunity’s increasing confidence in the impartiality \r\nof the Court and in the high quality of its work, as well \r\nas in the increased role that it is called to play in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n In closing, I would like to add that we have no \r\ndoubt that the solutions to be found in each of these \r\ncases by the International Court of Justice will be the \r\nresult of thorough evaluation of the applicable norms \r\nand the relevant facts, thus further helping to \r\nstrengthen the international legal order, which is one of \r\nthe major roles that the Court has to play in this ever \r\nmore complicated world. \r\n Mr. Bristol (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation \r\nwarmly welcomes Her Excellency Judge Rosalyn \r\nHiggins, President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nand thanks her for the report of the Court (A/63/4) and \r\nfor her immense contributions to the progressive \r\ndevelopment of international law in the three years \r\nduring which she has been President of the Court. We \r\nare also appreciative of her briefing on 27 October to \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n19 08-57795 \r\n \r\nthe legal advisers of ministries of foreign affairs of \r\nMember States and to Sixth Committee representatives. \r\nWe welcome that enlightening annual exchange.  \r\n We are delighted that the Court is working \r\ntirelessly and consistently in the discharge of its \r\ntwofold mandate of adjudicating the legal disputes \r\nsubmitted to it by States in the exercise of their \r\nsovereignty and rendering advisory opinions on legal \r\nquestions referred to it by duly authorized United \r\nNations organs and specialized agencies. It is \r\nheartening to note that the past year was the most \r\nproductive in the Court’s history and that the Court, \r\nduring that period, handed down four substantive \r\njudgments and two orders and held hearings in four \r\ncases, with three judgments currently under \r\ndeliberation. Five new cases have also been submitted \r\nto the Court, including the General Assembly’s request \r\nfor an advisory opinion.  \r\n In addition, approximately 300 bilateral and \r\nmultilateral treaties provide for the Court to have \r\njurisdiction in the resolution of disputes arising from \r\ntheir application or interpretation. \r\n The Court is also seized of cases concerning more \r\ncutting-edge issues such as allegations of massive \r\nhuman rights violations, including genocide, and the \r\nmanagement of shared natural resources. Needless to \r\nsay, that continuing increase in the Court’s caseload \r\nrequires adequate and commensurate resources. \r\n We therefore thank the Court for the various \r\nprocedural innovations and initiatives that it has adopted \r\nto be more efficient and to eliminate the backlog of \r\ncases. Those innovations include simplifying the Court’s \r\ndeliberations, continuously improving its working \r\nmethods, issuing periodic practice directions, reaching \r\nout to other international courts and tribunals and taking \r\nfull advantage of information technology through the \r\nlaunching of a new website. \r\n The foregoing is a positive development, \r\nespecially in view of the fact that the value of the \r\nCourt is not to be judged only by the number of cases it \r\nhandles but more by its contribution to the progressive \r\ndevelopment of international law. The invaluable \r\nnature of the Court’s contributions was only slightly \r\nrevealed when the President addressed legal advisers \r\non 27 October, through her reference to but a few \r\ncases. Her discussion of the cases threw light on some \r\nof the issues that the Sixth Committee is currently \r\ndeliberating. \r\n My delegation notes with satisfaction the \r\nrefreshing interchange and regular dialogue between \r\nthe Court and other international courts and tribunals. \r\nIssues decided by other international or regional \r\njudicial bodies arise in Court cases, and the judicial \r\nwork of other international courts and tribunals has \r\nrelevance to Court findings. That development is \r\nhighly commendable, especially as it could help in \r\nforestalling fragmentation of international law. We \r\ntherefore commend the Court for its cooperation with \r\nthose international judicial bodies. \r\n In recognition of the indispensable and \r\ndependable nature of the Court’s work, my country \r\nsubmitted to the Court’s jurisdiction in its dispute with \r\nCameroon, a neighbouring country. In the same vein, \r\nsince the Court’s judgment in 2002 we have \r\npainstakingly taken steps to implement the judgment, a \r\nprocess that was completed on 14 August 2008. \r\n In that unprecedented achievement, Nigeria \r\nclearly demonstrated its deep commitment to \r\ninternational peace and security by adhering to the \r\nCourt’s ruling, thereby shunning the option of \r\nbelligerence. We urge Member States to take disputes \r\nbefore the Court. That will ensure the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes and broaden the spectrum of the \r\nCourt’s contribution to the further development and \r\ndissemination of international law. \r\n Mr. Muita (Kenya): At the outset, allow me to \r\njoin other delegations in commending the President for \r\nthe excellent manner in which he continues to guide \r\nour deliberations in the Assembly. \r\n My delegation would like to commend Judge \r\nRosalyn Higgins, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, for her valuable contribution to the work of \r\nthe Court. As she approaches retirement, my delegation \r\nwould like to thank her most sincerely and wish her \r\nwell in her future endeavours. \r\n We thank Judge Higgins for her introduction of \r\nthe report of the Court contained in document A/63/4, \r\ndetailing the work accomplished by the Court over the \r\npast year. The report discloses the Court’s contribution \r\nto the global administration of justice. My delegation \r\nunderscores the importance of that role and of respect \r\nfor the rule of law as the only guarantee of lasting \r\npeace in the world. \r\n We note that the past judicial year has been very \r\nactive for the Court, having been seized of six cases, \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 20 \r\n \r\nwhich it has dealt with expeditiously. The diversity of \r\ncases before the Court illustrates the Court’s \r\nuniversality. That demonstrates the crucial role played \r\nby the Court in the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes, thereby contributing immensely to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and stability, as \r\nprovided in the United Nations Charter. \r\n In that regard, we urge States that have not done \r\nso to accept the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, in \r\naccordance with Article 36 of the Statute of the Court. \r\nWe also encourage States, in the exercise of their \r\nsovereignty, to freely submit disputes to the Court.  \r\n In addition, it is within the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt to be consulted by States, the General Assembly \r\nor the Security Council on any legal question arising \r\nfrom the scope of their activities. Similarly, other \r\norgans of the United Nations and agencies so \r\nauthorized by the General Assembly may seek advisory \r\nopinions from the Court, to clear any doubt that they \r\nhave regarding any matter of interest. In that regard, \r\nwe wish to point out that increasing compliance with \r\nthe Court’s decisions contributes to the credibility of \r\ninternational law. \r\n Kenya attaches great importance to the work of \r\nthe Court and appreciates the mechanisms that have \r\nbeen put in place to disseminate information about its \r\nactivities. Such information encompasses the decisions \r\nof the Court, which we recognize for their contribution \r\nto the progressive development of international law. \r\nGiven the significance of the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations, we encourage the Court to \r\ncontinue disseminating its decisions and other \r\npublications to the relevant institutions and Member \r\nStates so as to create more awareness about its work, \r\nfunctions and jurisdiction. \r\n In our view, the official visits to the Court by \r\nheads of States and Government and other high-\r\nranking Government officials reflect the recognition \r\nconferred on the Court and play an important role in \r\nenhancing its image as a central organ for the \r\nresolution of international disputes. We encourage such \r\nvisits as part of the awareness programmes, and we \r\nappreciate the measures to educate officials from \r\nMember States during such visits. \r\n We note from the report the need for \r\nmodernization of the facilities of the Court to enable it \r\nto operate in an environment that meets established \r\nstandards and criteria. My delegation has further noted \r\nthe pension claim for judges of the Court. We are of the \r\nopinion that both claims have merit. We therefore think \r\nthat the two issues, in addition to that of staffing levels \r\nin the Court’s Department of Legal Matters, deserve \r\nthe positive consideration of Member States. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that peace and justice \r\nare inextricable. Whether the two must go together is a \r\ncomplex issue. It is certain that peace can only be \r\nsustained if the issues of justice are properly put in \r\nplace. \r\n Mr. Nhleko (Swaziland): Let me congratulate the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for a productive session \r\nand thank it for the comprehensive report in document \r\nA/63/4, presented to us by the President of the Court, \r\nRosalyn Higgins. \r\n As the International Court of Justice is the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, its work \r\ncontributes to international peace and security and is \r\nwidely appreciated. The Court has significantly \r\nadvanced the international rule of law with landmark \r\ndecisions and advisory opinions characterized by the \r\ndiverse and rich legal background of its members. It is \r\nindeed a cornerstone of the international legal order. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland reaffirms its strong \r\nsupport for the Court.  \r\n My delegation notes with satisfaction that over \r\nthe past year, the number of cases pending before the \r\nCourt remained high and that some of them involved \r\ndeveloping States. The Kingdom of Swaziland supports \r\nthe use of the Court by Member States and the right of \r\nUnited Nations institutions to seek advisory opinions \r\non questions relating to their functions. We underline \r\nthat it is of the utmost importance for States to comply \r\nwith the decisions of the Court.  \r\n Upon becoming a Member of the Organization in \r\n1968, the Kingdom of Swaziland declared its readiness \r\nto accept the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. \r\nConsequently, we urge those States that have not yet \r\ndone so to consider accepting the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nin accordance with its Statute. \r\n Notwithstanding its financial difficulties, the \r\nCourt continues to soldier on and to respond with \r\ndetermination in offsetting an increased workload with \r\nmaximum efficiency. My delegation is pleased to note \r\nthat the Court has managed to clear its backlog of cases \r\nand that in an effort to increase and expedite the \r\navailability of Court documents and reduce \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n21 08-57795 \r\n \r\ncommunication costs it has launched a new website \r\nthat makes it possible to access the Court’s entire \r\njurisprudence since 1946, thus ensuring wider global \r\nawareness of its activities. Further, we applaud the \r\nCourt for its contributions as part of its current role in \r\npromoting the rule of law, following the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1). \r\n For a judicial body of the magnitude of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to function effectively, it \r\nmust be accorded the support it deserves. Accordingly, \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland appeals to the Organization \r\nto provide the Court with the tools it needs for its \r\nservice to humanity. \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): It is my pleasure and honour \r\nto address the Assembly on behalf of the Government \r\nof Japan. My delegation would like to express its \r\ngratitude to President Rosalyn Higgins for her in-depth \r\nreport describing the current situation of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and its appreciation and \r\nsupport for the achievements in the work of the Court \r\nduring the past year. We welcome the fact that Member \r\nStates are in principle trying to resolve disputes \r\nthrough international law. Close cooperation between \r\nMember States and the Court to that end should \r\ncontinue. \r\n The Court’s devoted work and profound legal \r\nwisdom in seeking peaceful settlement of disputes have \r\nbeen attracting the respect and support of international \r\nsociety. In the present international community, where \r\nwe continue to witness armed conflicts and acts of \r\nterrorism, the firm establishment of law and order is \r\ntruly indispensable. Indeed, there has been an \r\nincreasing awareness among nations that international \r\nsociety must recognize the value and share the goal of \r\nestablishing and maintaining the primacy of \r\ninternational law. In that regard, the role of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations cannot be overstated. \r\n As a State resolutely devoted to peace and firmly \r\ndedicated to the promotion of the rule of law and \r\nrespect for the principle of the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, Japan appreciates the strenuous efforts and \r\nwork of the Court over the past year in delivering \r\ndecisions based on exhaustive deliberation. We believe \r\nthat the Court must bring to bear not only a profound \r\nknowledge of international law but also a farsighted \r\nview of the international community, given that the \r\nworld is now experiencing such rapid change and that a \r\nvariety of international disputes continue to arise. \r\nJapan respects the Court’s ability to meet that \r\nrequirement and continues to fully support its work.  \r\n Japan has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of \r\nthe Court since becoming a Member State of the \r\nUnited Nations. We urge Member States that have not \r\nyet done so to accept the Court’s jurisdiction in order \r\nto facilitate establishment of the rule of law in the \r\ninternational community. \r\n In concluding my statement, I wish to reiterate \r\nthe great importance the international community \r\nattaches to the lofty cause and work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. Japan, for its part, will \r\ncontinue to contribute to the invaluable work of the \r\nCourt. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nfirst to extend my warmest congratulations to \r\nMs. Rosalyn Higgins, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, and to the other judges and all of the \r\nCourt’s staff for the excellent work they have \r\naccomplished as part of that institution. \r\n As an international court with a general character, \r\nthe International Court of Justice is indubitably the \r\nprincipal link in the international legal system that, in \r\nits day-to-day work, promotes international justice, the \r\ndevelopment of international law and the strengthening \r\nof the ideals of peace and justice that oversaw the \r\ncreation of the Organization.  \r\n My delegation is pleased to be participating once \r\nagain in the consideration of the annual report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (A/63/4). It is also an \r\nexcellent opportunity to highlight the constructive \r\nwork of the Court and to confirm Senegal’s keen \r\ninterest in its diverse activities. \r\n My delegation is pleased to see the increased \r\nnumber of requests being made to the International \r\nCourt of Justice, which reflects the widespread \r\nacceptance of the primacy of law and the interest that \r\nStates accord to the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\nThe importance of the role of the International Court of \r\nJustice as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations in settling disputes can be gauged by the \r\ngrowing confidence placed in it by States that \r\nincreasingly are turning to the wisdom of its judges. \r\n In promoting the legal resolution of disputes, the \r\nsupreme court of the United Nations participates in \r\nestablishing peaceful relations between States and \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 22 \r\n \r\ngreatly contributes to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. Likewise, in basing its action on \r\npromoting the rule of law, the International Court of \r\nJustice also contributes to respect for the rule of law at \r\nthe international level. In addition, the decisions and \r\njudgments of the Court serve as jurisprudence and \r\nlegal interpretations in many situations, thus \r\ncontributing to the enrichment, codification and \r\nunification of international law.  \r\n My delegation therefore reiterates its strong \r\nsupport for the International Court of Justice and its \r\ncommendable efforts to maintain its current \r\neffectiveness and we plead for all necessary assistance \r\nto that end.  \r\n As I had occasion to recall during the Sixth \r\nCommittee’s consideration of the report of the Special \r\nCommittee on the Charter of the United Nations and on \r\nthe Strengthening of the Role of the Organization \r\n(A/63/33) at this session of the General Assembly, the \r\nbeneficial effects of the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nare evident. \r\n The reference in the United Nations Charter to \r\nthe settlement of disputes “by peaceful means, and in \r\nconformity with the principles of justice and \r\ninternational law” being one of the primary purposes of \r\nthe United Nations and the main instrument for \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, sums up \r\nthe importance of that type of settlement. \r\n Thus, the United Nations has a special \r\nresponsibility to promote the settlement of disputes, \r\nincluding legal disputes, by the International Court of \r\nJustice. That is why my delegation is greatly interested \r\nin the Trust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement of \r\nDisputes through the International Court of Justice. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to echo the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal to States to make substantial and \r\nregular contributions to the Trust Fund.  \r\n Mr. García González (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of El Salvador wishes to \r\nexpress its gratitude to Judge Rosalyn Higgins, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for her \r\nintroduction of the Court’s excellent report (A/63/4) to \r\nthe General Assembly, covering the period from \r\n1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008.  \r\n We also wish to congratulate the Court on its \r\nefforts to achieve the objectives that Judge Higgins set \r\nforth in her statement. This is of prime importance in \r\nincreasing the confidence of the international \r\ncommunity in that high court of justice, which \r\nsignificantly contributes to maintaining international \r\npeace and security by exercising its jurisdiction. \r\n That growing confidence in the Court is reflected \r\nin the number of litigious disputes and requests for \r\nadvisory opinions being brought before it, and in the \r\ndiversity of the States that are party to them. As the \r\nreport clearly states, that shows the universality of the \r\nCourt.  \r\n We very much welcome the range of disputes \r\nbrought before the Court. As well as dealing with \r\ntraditional territorial disputes, maritime delimitation \r\ncases and disputes linked to the treatment of nationals \r\nof one State by other States, the Court is also now \r\nexamining very topical matters, such as those \r\nconnected with human rights and shared natural \r\nresources. Those disputes have gained in complexity \r\nnow that they involve several phases as a result of \r\npreliminary objections raised by respondents with \r\nregard to the jurisdiction or admissibility, as well as the \r\nrequests for provisional measures that need urgent \r\nexamination.  \r\n The Republic of El Salvador acknowledges the \r\ngreat legal value of the judgments of the Court both to \r\nthe States party to a dispute and to all other States in \r\nthe international community, since they establish \r\nguidelines that contribute to the codification and \r\nprogressive development of international law and the \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law.  \r\n In that regard, our country is delighted to \r\nwelcome the establishment of the Court’s new website, \r\nlaunched last year, not only because of the amount of \r\ninformation it provides, but also because of the efforts \r\nto include material in the official United Nations \r\nlanguages. That not only extends the global reach of \r\nthe Court, but also means that, from the outset of their \r\nstudies, future generations of lawyers will know and \r\nbecome familiar with the large body of jurisprudence \r\nestablished by the International Court of Justice and \r\nunderstand the important role that the Court plays in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to recall that, in a few \r\ndays, in the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil the election of judges to the five vacant seats \r\non the International Court of Justice will take place. \r\nWe call on those who are elected to ensure that their \r\nwork in the Court is as committed and dedicated as that \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n23 08-57795 \r\n \r\nwhich has been carried out to date, since it represents \r\nthe great civilizations and principal judicial systems of \r\nthe world. \r\n Ms. Kok (Singapore): My delegation would like \r\nto express our appreciation to Her Excellency Judge \r\nRosalyn Higgins, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, to the other members of the Court, and to \r\nthe Registrar and the staff of the Court for the \r\ncomprehensive report (A/63/4) documenting the work \r\nof the International Court of Justice for the period \r\n1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008. Singapore \r\ncongratulates the Court on the conclusion of another \r\nindustrious and productive year. \r\n Singapore attaches great importance to \r\ninternational law, and we have always sought to \r\nconduct ourselves in conformity with it. We have \r\nworked with other like-minded States to strengthen the \r\nrule of law in the world. We believe in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. When States cannot resolve \r\ntheir differences by consultations, negotiations or \r\nmediation, we believe that it is preferable to refer a \r\ndispute to a binding third-party procedure. That can \r\ntake the form of either arbitration or adjudication.  \r\n The International Court of Justice provides States \r\nwith the latter recourse. It is an efficient mechanism \r\nestablished to settle, in accordance with international \r\nlaw, legal disputes submitted to it by States. The Court \r\nplays an important role in enunciating principles of \r\ninternational law that help to develop predictability and \r\nconsistency in inter-State relations. For those reasons, \r\nSingapore wishes to stress its firm belief in the \r\nimportance of the Court and the critical role it plays in \r\nupholding the rule of law in the world and the corollary \r\nmaintenance of international peace and order. \r\n Singapore notes that there are numerous \r\nspecialized courts and tribunals in the United Nations \r\nsystem. While there is no formal hierarchy of courts in \r\ninternational law, the International Court of Justice is \r\nthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations and \r\nis primus inter pares, or first among equals. \r\nNotwithstanding its increasing workload, the Court has \r\ndischarged its responsibilities with impeccable \r\nprofessionalism and expertise. \r\n As stated in the report, on 23 May 2008, the \r\nCourt delivered its judgment in the case concerning \r\nSovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, \r\nMiddle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore). \r\nThe Court found that sovereignty over Pedra Branca \r\nbelongs to Singapore and sovereignty over Middle \r\nRocks belongs to Malaysia. The Court also found that \r\nsovereignty over South Ledge belongs to the State in \r\nthe territorial waters of which it is located. \r\n The judgment marks an end to a long-standing \r\ndispute between Malaysia and Singapore. As close \r\nneighbours that wish to maintain good bilateral \r\nrelations, we decided to refer the matter to binding \r\nthird-party adjudication, and thus we brought the case \r\nbefore the Court in 2003. \r\n From the very beginning, when the decision was \r\nmade to submit the matter to the Court, both Malaysia \r\nand Singapore agreed to abide by the judgment of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. This joint commitment \r\nto honour and abide by the judgment of the Court and \r\nfully implement its decision has been repeatedly \r\nconfirmed by both Malaysia and Singapore, most \r\nrecently after the judgment was delivered. To ensure \r\nthe implementation of the judgment in a peaceful and \r\namicable manner, Malaysia and Singapore have set up \r\na joint technical committee to resolve issues arising \r\nfrom the judgment. \r\n Most importantly, the commitment to abide by \r\nthe decision of a third-party adjudicator by both sides \r\nto a dispute is fundamental to upholding and respecting \r\nthe rule of international law, which is necessary for \r\npeaceful inter-State relations and the maintenance of \r\nworld order. This idea is another aspect and subset of \r\nthe principle of States upholding their international \r\nobligations in good faith. \r\n Singapore has always marvelled at how the Court \r\nmanages to do so much with the funds allocated. \r\nSingapore takes note of the Court’s appropriate and \r\ntimely development plans as described in its report. We \r\napplaud the Court’s efforts to modernize its system in \r\nline with current practices.  \r\n Singapore is sympathetic to the Court’s need for \r\nmore manpower. Given that it continues to fulfil its \r\nmandate responsibly and given its core function as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations system, \r\nthe Court should be readily supported by all Member \r\nStates. It is important that we ensure that the Court is \r\nadequately provided for. Singapore supports the \r\ncontinued allocation of resources from the United \r\nNations regular budget to the Court for its effective \r\nfunctioning. \r\nA/63/PV.34  \r\n \r\n08-57795 24 \r\n \r\n In summary, I would like to reiterate that \r\nSingapore places great emphasis on the rule of law, \r\nboth domestic and international. As a member of the \r\npeaceloving United Nations community, Singapore \r\nfirmly believes that each of us shares a special \r\nresponsibility to ensure continued respect for and \r\nobservance of the rules of international law. We can do \r\nour part in this endeavour by showing our support for \r\nthe Court and respecting its decisions. The Court can \r\nbe assured of Singapore’s steadfast regard for it, and \r\nmy delegation wishes the Court all good fortune as it \r\nengages in the work ahead. \r\n Mr. Serradas Taveres (Portugal): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. Let me also \r\ncongratulate President Higgins for her work at the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and thank her again for \r\nthe comprehensive report on the work of the Court \r\nover the period under review. \r\n The International Court of Justice, it should be \r\nrecalled, is the only international court of a universal \r\ncharacter with general jurisdiction. As the principal \r\njudicial body of the United Nations, the Court holds \r\nimportant responsibilities in the international \r\ncommunity, playing a fundamental role in the judicial \r\nsettlement of disputes between States and in the \r\nstrengthening of the international rule of law. \r\n The workload of the Court confirms its relevant \r\nrole in the international legal system. As Judge Higgins \r\nreminded us in her statement, the past year has been the \r\nmost productive year in the Court’s history. In July \r\n2008, the number of cases on the docket stood at 12. In \r\nthe period under review the Court issued four judgments \r\nand an order on a request for indication of provisional \r\nmeasures. Further, it held hearings in four cases. \r\n It is worthwhile highlighting that these cases \r\ncome from all over the world, relate to a great variety \r\nof subject matters and are growing in factual and legal \r\ncomplexity. The Court has undertaken an impressive \r\neffort in order to respond to this high level of demand \r\nfor its services. However, it is also important for States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to acknowledge the \r\nCourt’s need for adequate resources. \r\n The Court plays a crucial role in the international \r\nlegal system, and this role is increasingly being \r\nrecognized and accepted. As of 31 July 2008, the \r\n192 States Members of the United Nations were parties \r\nto the Statute of the Court, and 66 of them had \r\nrecognized its jurisdiction as compulsory. Moreover, \r\napproximately 300 bilateral and multilateral treaties \r\nprovide for the Court to have jurisdiction in the resolution \r\nof disputes arising out of the application or interpretation \r\nof such treaties. Portugal would like to encourage all \r\nStates that have not yet done so to consider accepting the \r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction. \r\n Portugal is confident that the Court will continue \r\nto overcome the challenges that will increasingly \r\nimpinge upon it. These challenges may be considered \r\nto be a good sign, as their existence means that States \r\nhave confidence in the Court for the settlement of \r\ndisputes and for the strengthening of the international \r\nrule of law towards justice and peace. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I would like first of all to extend my deepest \r\nthanks to Judge Rosalyn Higgins, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for the excellent report \r\nshe has just submitted to us on the work of the Court \r\nduring the period from 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008. \r\n I wish to say to the President of the Court that for \r\nthe peoples of the United Nations, the role entrusted to \r\nthat very noble institution that she has the difficult and \r\ndelicate task of heading, is irreplaceable in terms of \r\nfinding peaceful settlement to international disputes \r\nand in promoting the rule of law. \r\n That is why it is correct to note that, at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, the leaders of the entire world met \r\ntogether here in this very Hall committed to \r\nemphasizing the obligation imposed on States to settle \r\ntheir disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with \r\nChapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nincluding, should it be necessary, the obligation to bring \r\nsuch disputes before the International Court of Justice. \r\n In our ongoing search for a society in which law \r\nprevails, we see the International Court of Justice as \r\nthe best means for ensuring a brighter future for future \r\ngenerations.  \r\n Cameroon is convinced of the importance of law \r\nin inter-State relations and would therefore like to take \r\nthis opportunity to confirm once again its support for \r\nthe role played by the International Court of Justice as \r\nthe principal judicial organ of the Organization and the \r\nonly universal court with general jurisdiction. Not only \r\ndoes the Court decide disputes that States bring to it \r\nfreely in exercise of their sovereignty, but the Court \r\n A/63/PV.34\r\n \r\n25 08-57795 \r\n \r\ncan also be consulted on any legal issue by the General \r\nAssembly or the Security Council.  \r\n Despite the high level and complexity of the \r\nmatters brought to it, the Court has never been as \r\nsuccessful and productive as it has been in recent years.  \r\n In the period under review, it has issued four \r\njudgments and one order on a request for the indication \r\nof provisional measures. Moreover, the cases brought \r\nto the Court have come from all corners of the globe. \r\nThat admirable vitality of the Court derives from the \r\nintrinsic worth and the high moral probity of the men \r\nand women who work there. It also derives from the \r\nseriousness of the decisions rendered by the Court and \r\nfrom its enduring desire to deal swiftly with matters \r\nbrought before it. \r\n Cameroon welcomes the successes recorded by \r\nthe Court for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Those results would not have been \r\npossible unless the Court were inspired by a constant \r\ndesire to improve its productivity. The Assembly may \r\nbe assured of my country’s support for the significant \r\ncontribution made by the Court, for the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations and for the remarkable efforts the \r\nCourt has made to quickly settle matters submitted to it. \r\n Since it was founded in 1946, the Court has \r\nhanded down over 92 judgments, of which more than \r\none fifth have been in the last 10 years. That increase is \r\nproof of the confidence that the authority of the Court \r\ninspires in more and more States. Cameroon believes in \r\nthe rule of law, and we believe that trust in the Court \r\nshould be reflected in universal acceptance of its \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction, in accordance with Article 36, \r\nparagraph 2 of the Statute of the Court. As of 31 July \r\nthis year, of the 192 Member States of the United \r\nNations, only 66 have made declarations recognizing \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. That is less \r\nthan one third of the membership. \r\n The increase in the number of cases brought \r\nbefore the Court is an ongoing challenge, but it is one \r\nwe must face if we are to achieve universal jurisdiction \r\nand confirm our support for Article 36. \r\n May I turn now to the matter of the resources the \r\nCourt needs to proceed impartially with its work. For \r\nthe biennium 2008-2009 the Court had requested a \r\nnumber of posts, not all of which were approved. \r\nCameroon believes that if we do not respond \r\nfavourably to the Court’s financial requests, we run the \r\nrisk of hampering the good normal functioning of the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations. We will \r\nclosely follow the proposals that the Assembly’s Fifth \r\nCommittee makes on this matter, on the basis of \r\ntechnical advice from the Advisory Committee on \r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions, which has \r\nalways supported allocations to modernize the tools \r\nand working methods of the Court and to improve the \r\nconditions of service of the judges. We have to be \r\nsupportive of the Court as it increases its productivity, \r\nin particular as regards the progressive development of \r\ninternational law. \r\n In conclusion, may I say once again that my \r\ncountry truly believes in the primacy of law in \r\ninternational relations and, thus, in the fundamental \r\nrole of the International Court of Justice in promoting \r\nthe rule of law.  \r\n My country’s commitment to the Court and to \r\nlaw is illustrated by the Bakassi case, which we \r\nbrought before the Court. The case resulted in a \r\nsuccessful outcome between Cameroon and the sister \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, thereby opening up a new era of \r\npeace and enhanced economic cooperation between the \r\ntwo countries. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to \r\ninform members that agenda item 58, “Report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council”, will be considered on \r\nTuesday, 4 November 2008, in the morning.  \r\n I should also like to announce the following \r\nactivities. The 2008 United Nations Pledging \r\nConference for Development Activities will be held on \r\nMonday, 10 November 2008, in the morning, in \r\nConference Room 2. The Pledging Conference for the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations and the World Food Programme will be held in \r\nthe afternoon of the same day, Monday, 10 November \r\n2008, also in Conference Room 2. \r\n The announcement of voluntary contributions to \r\nthe 2008 programmes of the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\nwill take place on Wednesday, 10 December 2008, at \r\n11 a.m., in the Economic and Social Council Chamber.  \r\n Members are requested to consult the Journal for \r\nfurther details on those activities. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n"
