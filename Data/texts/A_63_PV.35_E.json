" United Nations  A/63/PV.35\r\n  \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly \r\nSixty-third session \r\n \r\n35th plenary meeting \r\nFriday, 31 October 2008, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York \r\n \r\nOfficial Records\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of \r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original \r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature \r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room \r\nC-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. \r\n08-58347 (E) \r\n*0858347* \r\nPresident: Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Abdelaziz \r\n(Egypt), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 66 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Court of Justice  \r\n \r\n  Report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/63/4) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/229) \r\n \r\n Mr. Hernández García (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The Mexican delegation is extremely grateful \r\nto the International Court of Justice for its hard work \r\nthis year. We would also like to congratulate the \r\nPresident of the Court, Judge Rosalyn Higgins, for her \r\noutstanding work at the helm of the highest legal body. \r\nWe wish to pay tribute to her as the first woman to be \r\nelected as a judge of the Court. Under her leadership, \r\nthe Court has adopted a variety of measures that, with \r\nthe passing of time, have had an impact on its \r\nefficiency. Her upcoming retirement will certainly pose \r\nan important challenge to the Court. On behalf of my \r\ndelegation, I wish her every success in her future \r\nendeavours. \r\n Mexico is fully confident that the renewal of the \r\nCourt that will take place in the days to come will \r\nallow it to continue its outstanding work, ensuring that \r\nthe primary legal systems and the various regional \r\nperspectives and views are duly represented. \r\n It is important to highlight the 15 cases before the \r\nCourt and the five judgments it issued in the period \r\nunder consideration. Undoubtedly, that activity \r\ndemonstrates the confidence that the international \r\ncommunity has placed in the Court as one of the \r\nprincipal international juridical organs. Although there \r\nhas been a constant increase in the number of cases \r\nbrought before the Court, we are pleased that it has not \r\nfallen behind, which attests to the positive impact of \r\nthe amendments made to the Courts’ rules of procedure \r\nand working methods. Proof of that is the fact that, in \r\nthe judicial year 2007-2008, the Court was able to \r\nconsider six cases simultaneously. \r\n My delegation welcomes the Court’s achievement \r\nof its objective of clearing the backlog in its docket. As \r\nJudge Higgins stated, that has made it possible to \r\nensure that States obtain justice without unreasonable \r\ndelay. \r\n Nevertheless, Mexico notes with concern another \r\nimportant issue raised in the report — the urgent need \r\nto increase human resources to support the activities of \r\nthe Court. In that respect, we agree that there is an \r\nurgent need for the Court’s members to have \r\npersonalized legal support so that they can spend more \r\ntime in consideration and deliberation. The creation of \r\na documents division by merging the Library and the \r\nArchives Division is also essential to the proper and \r\nflexible functioning of the Court. Given the Court’s \r\nheavy workload, it is important for the General \r\nAssembly to heed the call to increase the number of \r\nlaw clerk posts and to create the aforementioned \r\ndocuments division. \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 2 \r\n \r\n The current report (A/63/4) clearly and concisely \r\ndescribes the disputes now before the Court, which \r\nreflect its universal character. My delegation notes that \r\nfive of the 15 cases before the Court in the reporting \r\nperiod involve Latin American States, and that two \r\ncases involving the region were resolved this year. One \r\nof the two judgments issued on Latin American \r\ndisputes was the decision in the case concerning \r\nTerritorial and Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua \r\nand Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. \r\nHonduras) in which sovereignty over Bobel Cay, \r\nSavanna Cay, Port Royal Cay and South Cay was \r\ndecided. The ruling of the Court stated that neither of \r\nthe two States had title to those islands by virtue of the \r\nprinciple of uti possidetis juris. The Court ultimately \r\nestablished the sovereignty of Honduras, based on the \r\nprinciple of effective sovereignty. \r\n Equally important was the Court’s decision to \r\nreject the equidistance line method to delimit maritime \r\nzones between the two States, instead preferring to \r\ncarry out a complex delimitation process using a \r\nbisector line. The decision also demonstrates the \r\nCourt’s capacity to deal with topics that are highly \r\ncomplex both technically and legally, while \r\nsafeguarding the rights of third States that could be \r\naffected. \r\n As the Assembly will recall, Mexico participated \r\nfor the first time in a dispute before the International \r\nCourt of Justice in the Case concerning Avena and \r\nOther Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of \r\nAmerica). In that case, the Court specified the scope of \r\nobligations set forth in article 36 of the Vienna \r\nConvention on Consular Relations with regard to the \r\nright to notification and information on consular \r\nassistance and clarified those aspects that the parties \r\nwanted to be defined in the LaGrand (Germany v. \r\nUnited States of America) ruling. The report notes \r\nMexico’s filing of a request for interpretation of the \r\nAvena Judgment, based on article 60 of its statute. The \r\nrequest was accompanied by a request for the granting \r\nof provisional measures to stay the execution of José \r\nErnesto Medellín and four other Mexican nationals in \r\nTexas. Mexico’s recourse to the Court is based on its \r\ntrust in that principal international tribunal as the \r\nsuitable forum for the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nbetween States. \r\n Today the International Court of Justice \r\nintervenes in the settlement of disputes dealing with \r\nsubjects that are very different from those it has \r\ntraditionally addressed, such as territorial and maritime \r\ndelimitation disputes. Today’s issues are related to the \r\ntreatment of nationals by other States, the denunciation \r\nof massive human rights violations such as genocide, \r\nor the management of shared natural resources. \r\n My delegation welcomes the detailed information \r\nin the report on the role of the International Court of \r\nJustice in the promotion of the rule of law, as well as \r\nthe Court’s contribution to the analysis of that topic in \r\nthe General Assembly. We agree with the Court’s \r\ninterpretation regarding its fundamental role in the \r\npromotion of the rule of law as the tribunal of justice \r\nand as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Finally, we wish to highlight the importance of \r\ndisseminating the Court’s decisions through its \r\npublications and website. As my delegation has noted \r\nbefore, the United Nations Secretariat has translated \r\nonly a very few of the Court’s decisions into all the \r\nOrganization’s official languages. We encourage the \r\nOrganization to continue its efforts, in a gradual \r\nmanner, to make the work of the Court available to \r\nMember States in all the official languages. \r\n Mexico reiterates before the Assembly its full \r\nsupport for and commitment to the International Court \r\nof Justice. \r\n Mr. Elshareef (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation believes that the International Court of \r\nJustice is one of the strongest citadels of justice and an \r\nhonest guardian of the rules of international law. Thus \r\nit deals with matters concerning the rule of law rather \r\nthan matters on the law of domination, hegemony, \r\nviolence and the use of force in relations among States. \r\nMy delegation is also pleased to express its deep \r\nappreciation to Ms. Rosalyn Higgins, the President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, for her presentation \r\nof the report (A/63/4), which described all of its \r\nactivities and highlighted its most significant \r\nachievements in the fulfilment of its tasks.  \r\n The many legal disputes from all over the world \r\nthat are submitted for consideration by the Court \r\ninclude those between European States, between Latin \r\nAmerican States and two African countries, as well as \r\nother regional and maritime disputes, and they are the \r\nbest proof of its universality. We note here the growing \r\nnumber of cases before the Court and the many issues \r\nthat it has decided on, as indicated in the report. That \r\nconfirms and strengthens trust in the Court and its \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n3 08-58347 \r\n \r\nability to play its role and to discharge the most urgent \r\nand important task of the United Nations, namely the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes under the umbrella of \r\nthe rules of international law. \r\n Here we also wish to note the increasing trust of \r\nMember States in the Court, as evidenced in the \r\naccession of 192 States to its Statute and the fact that \r\n66 States, including the Sudan, have deposited with the \r\nSecretary-General a declaration of their acceptance of \r\nits compulsory jurisdiction. \r\n My delegation wishes to stress the necessity of \r\nstrict compliance with the Court’s decisions. We \r\nnoticed that some parties pay no heed to the advisory \r\nopinions of the Court which negatively impacts its \r\nperformance and promotion of the rule of law. My \r\ndelegation commends the Court’s efforts to broadly \r\ndisseminate its publications and documents. That \r\nprovides a good opportunity for people to become \r\nacquainted with its decisions and opinions and \r\nenhances awareness and relations with other legal \r\nentities. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate our belief in the \r\nprincipal role of the Court. We express our thanks to all \r\nof its judges, who perform their tasks with great \r\nprofessionalism and transparency. We reiterate our \r\nsupport for the Court in its efforts to achieve its noble \r\nobjectives, namely justice and the rule of law. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 66. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item \r\n66? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 69  \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/323) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/471) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In addition to the note by \r\nthe Secretary-General transmitting the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, the Assembly has before \r\nit a report of the Secretary-General on expenses \r\nincurred and reimbursement received by the United \r\nNations in connection with assistance provided to the \r\nCourt. \r\n I call on Mr. Philippe Kirsch, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. \r\n Mr. Kirsch (spoke in French): I am very pleased \r\ntoday to present the fourth annual report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) to the United \r\nNations (see A/63/323). \r\n Ten years ago, the General Assembly set the stage \r\nfor the creation of the International Criminal Court \r\nwhen it decided to convene the Rome Conference to \r\ndraw up the Statute of the Court. Since then, the Court \r\nhas grown into a full-fledged independent judicial \r\ninstitution backed by 108 States parties. \r\n In my remarks today, I would like to update the \r\nAssembly on developments at the Court over the past \r\nyear, take stock of where the Court stands today, ten \r\nyears after the Rome Conference, and share some \r\nthoughts on the future of the Court. \r\n During the past year four situations were before \r\nthe Court. Three were referred to the Court by States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute and concern events that \r\ntook place on their own territories. The fourth was \r\nreferred to the Court by the Security Council, acting \r\nunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. In \r\nthat regard, it is useful to recall that, while the Statute \r\nprovides for the Prosecutor to begin an investigation \r\nproprio motu in accordance with certain conditions, he \r\nhas not yet used that option. All the situations before \r\nthe Court today are there at the will of States or the \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\n In the situation in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, referred to the Court by that State, preparations \r\nfor the trial of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo before Trial \r\nChamber I continued. He is accused of having enlisted \r\nand conscripted children under 15 and having made \r\nthem take an active part in hostilities. On 13 June \r\n2008, the Trial Chamber ordered a stay of the \r\nproceedings, having determined that a fair trial was not \r\npossible at that time due to the non-disclosure by the \r\nProsecutor of potentially exculpatory evidence. On \r\n2 July, the Trial Chamber consequently ordered \r\nThomas Lubanga’s immediate release. The decision to \r\nsuspend the proceedings was upheld by the Appeals \r\nChamber on 21 October. However, the same day, that \r\nChamber reversed the decision of the Trial Chamber \r\nconcerning Thomas Lubanga’s immediate release. The \r\nAppeals Chamber found the Trial Chamber had not \r\nconsidered all relevant factors and remanded the issue \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 4 \r\n \r\nof the defendant’s release to the Trial Chamber for \r\nreconsideration.  \r\n In the meantime, but separately from the judicial \r\nproceedings, the Prosecutor worked with the providers \r\nof the potentially exculpatory evidence to lift the \r\nconfidentiality restrictions that have prevented him \r\nfrom disclosing those materials to the defence or from \r\nmaking them available to the judges. The Prosecutor \r\nhas submitted a new application for the judges to \r\nreview those materials. The decision on Thomas \r\nLubanga’s release and the Prosecutor’s new application \r\nare currently under consideration by the Trial Chamber. \r\n In the same situation, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo surrendered Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui to the \r\nCourt on 7 February 2008. His case was subsequently \r\njoined with that of Germain Katanga, who had been \r\nsurrendered to the Court in October 2007. In \r\nSeptember 2008, Pre-Trial Chamber I confirmed seven \r\ncharges of war crimes and three charges of crimes \r\nagainst humanity against each of those two individuals. \r\nLast Friday, the joint file of Mr. Katanga and \r\nMr. Ngudjolo was transmitted to a new Trial Chamber, \r\nwhich is beginning preparations for their trial. \r\n In the situation in the Central African Republic, \r\nreferred to the Court by that State, Belgium \r\nsurrendered Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo to the Court on \r\n3 July 2008. He is suspected of having committed war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. Pre-Trial \r\nChamber III has begun preparations for a hearing on \r\nthe confirmation of the charges against Jean-Pierre \r\nBemba. A date for that hearing is still to be decided. \r\n In other cases, proceedings continued to a limited \r\ndegree owing to the fact that the following individuals \r\nhave not been arrested or surrendered to the Court: in \r\nthe situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nBosco Ntaganda; in the situation in Uganda, referred to \r\nthe Court by that State, Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, \r\nOkot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen; and in the \r\nsituation in Darfur, Sudan, referred to the Court by the \r\nSecurity Council, Ahmad Harun and Ali Kushayb. \r\n The Court has issued requests for arrest and \r\nsurrender to States on whose territories those persons \r\nmay be found. Under the Statute of the Court, States \r\nparties must arrest and surrender those persons in \r\naccordance with their national laws. Where they need \r\nassistance, the support of other States and international \r\norganizations is indispensable.  \r\n On 14 July 2008, the Prosecutor applied to Pre-\r\nTrial Chamber I for an arrest warrant for the President \r\nof Sudan, Omer Al-Bashir. That application is pending \r\nbefore the judges, who will decide independently \r\nwhether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe \r\nthat Mr. Al-Bashir committed crimes within the \r\njurisdiction of the Court. On 15 October, the Chamber \r\nrequested the Prosecutor to provide by 17 November \r\nadditional supporting materials in relation to some \r\naspects of that application. \r\n The Prosecutor’s Office continued the \r\ninvestigations in the four situations I have described. In \r\naddition, that Office examined information on crimes \r\nthat may have been committed within the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court in other situations. Thus, the Prosecutor \r\nhas publicly indicated that he is looking into situations \r\nconcerning Colombia, Georgia, Afghanistan, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and Kenya. \r\n(spoke in English)  \r\n Now, I would like to turn to where the Court \r\nstands today, 10 years after the Rome Conference was \r\nconvened by the General Assembly.  \r\n The ICC was born out of the international \r\ncommunity’s experience. Fifty years after the historic \r\nNuremberg and Tokyo tribunals, serious international \r\ncrimes continued to be committed with impunity. \r\nJustice was too often bargained away for the prospects, \r\nno matter how unlikely, of short-term political gains, \r\nno matter how minimal. As a result, victims endured \r\nthe double indignation of suffering harm and being \r\ndenied recourse to justice. Entire regions were \r\ndestabilized, as widespread or systematic crimes \r\ntriggered or exacerbated conflict. Societies seeking to \r\nemerge from conflict often struggled with \r\nreconciliation and with the re-establishment of the rule \r\nof law. \r\n Against that background, the creation of the ICC \r\nreflected the resolve of States to give a permanent \r\ninstitutional dimension to a fundamental shift in \r\ninternational relations that had started a few years \r\nearlier — from a culture of impunity to an approach \r\nbased on respect for justice and the rule of law. The \r\nCourt did not displace existing national or international \r\nmechanisms for resolving conflicts and ensuring \r\njustice. It was set up by States to complement, where \r\nnecessary and only where necessary, their own national \r\njurisdictions.  \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n5 08-58347 \r\n \r\n The Rome Statute reaffirms the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, and, while not \r\na part of the United Nations system, the ICC exists in \r\nrelationship with the United Nations. The Court is, \r\nnevertheless, a fundamentally different institution. Like \r\njustice itself, the Court is impartial and enduring. As a \r\npermanent and independent institution, it stands as a \r\nbulwark against the temptation, no matter how well \r\nintentioned, to bargain away justice. It does not partake \r\nin political negotiations to start or to stop \r\ninvestigations or proceedings. All are equally liable for \r\ncrimes committed within the jurisdiction of the Court. \r\n Since the entry into force of the Rome Statute in \r\n2003, the Court has adhered strictly to its independent \r\nand impartial mandate. Before beginning each of the \r\nfour current investigations, the Prosecutor analysed the \r\navailable information and concluded there was a \r\nreasonable basis to begin an investigation. The judges \r\nscrutinized each application by the Prosecutor for a \r\nwarrant of arrest to ensure that the objective criteria of \r\nthe Rome Statute were met. In all of their judicial \r\nproceedings, the Pre-Trial, Trial and Appeals Chambers \r\nhave faithfully upheld the Rome Statute, guaranteeing \r\nthe rights of accused persons and suspects and giving \r\neffect to the rights of victims. \r\n The accomplishments of the Court are not its own \r\nalone. They are due in large part to the States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society that have \r\nsupported it. The significance of those contributions \r\nhas been evident in the last three years.  \r\n First, States have entrusted the Court to \r\ninvestigate and prosecute crimes fairly and \r\nindependently where national courts are unwilling or \r\nunable to do so. As mentioned earlier, the Prosecutor \r\nhas not yet taken up any situation proprio motu. Each \r\nsituation under investigation has been referred to the \r\nCourt by a State party or by the Security Council. In \r\nthree of those four situations, States have asked the \r\nCourt to look into situations on their own territories. In \r\nother words — and I wish to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to this point — the Court has never yet \r\nchosen itself to intervene in any situation, any region \r\nor any country. It has only complied with its judicial \r\nmandate as requested by the States concerned or by the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Secondly, the cooperation of States, international \r\norganizations and civil society has been essential to the \r\nCourt’s functioning. The Court’s judicial proceedings \r\nwere made possible by States surrendering suspects, \r\nprotecting victims and witnesses and providing \r\nrelevant information. I am pleased to report that the \r\nUnited Nations has consistently provided exemplary \r\ncooperation to the Court. Civil society has been an \r\nequally vital source of support for the Court, \r\nencouraging ratification of the Rome Statute, assisting \r\nStates to develop necessary implementing legislation \r\nand providing a useful critical review of the Court’s \r\nactivities. \r\n Thirdly, States, international organizations and \r\ncivil society have been indispensable in ensuring \r\nrespect for the Court’s judicial mandate. The Court has \r\nbeen effective only because it is respected as an \r\nindependent, purely judicial institution whose \r\ndecisions will be enforced. The Court has earned that \r\nstatus in part through its own strict adherence to the \r\nRome Statute, but also as a result of the cooperation \r\nand public support of others. In that regard, the Court \r\ngreatly appreciates the Secretary-General’s continued \r\nassistance and his reiteration of the independence of \r\nthe Court. Similarly, a number of States parties and \r\nStates not party to the Rome Statute have helped to \r\ncreate a climate of support through their words and \r\nactions. Where States have been silent, civil society \r\nhas critically filled the void.  \r\n I would like to turn now briefly to the future of \r\nthe Court. This is a critical stage for the ICC. It is still \r\nfar too early to pass judgment on the success of the \r\nCourt, which is a very young institution. Its \r\ndevelopment has been faster than expected and the \r\nearly indications are decidedly positive, but the Court’s \r\nsuccess in the long term will depend on a number of \r\nfactors. Most fundamentally, it will depend on the \r\nCourt properly fulfilling its own mandate. The Court \r\nmust and will continue to do its part to ensure its \r\njudicial independence and impartiality. It will \r\ninvestigate and prosecute crimes within its jurisdiction \r\nin accordance with the principle of complementarity. It \r\nwill guarantee the rights of the accused and of \r\nsuspects. It will interpret the Rome Statute and develop \r\na body of jurisprudence. It will protect victims and \r\nwitnesses. It will give further effect to the rights of \r\nvictims to participate. It will address questions of \r\nreparations to victims. And in all those proceedings, it \r\nwill continue to strive for the highest standards of \r\nefficiency and transparency. \r\n However, it is important to bear in mind at all \r\ntimes that the ICC and the ICC system with its checks \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 6 \r\n \r\nand balances and limitations on the power of the Court \r\nwere created by States as a judicial mechanism to assist \r\nin the achievement of certain objectives mentioned in \r\nthe preamble of the Rome Statute, including the end of \r\nimpunity, as a way to assist in achieving peace, \r\nsecurity and the well-being of the world. That system \r\ncan work effectively only if all actors in the system \r\nplay their part and do so consistently. The success of \r\nthe Court will therefore also depend on the actions of \r\nothers.  \r\n The extent of ratification of the Rome Statute will \r\naffect the ability to which the Court can exercise its \r\njurisdiction. Doing so truly globally, reaching universal \r\njurisdiction over time, remains an indispensable goal. \r\n The Court will continue to require the \r\ncooperation of States, international organizations and \r\ncivil society. Legal obligations to cooperate with the \r\nCourt must be met and additional cooperation will be \r\nneeded. Most obviously, States need to execute \r\nwarrants of arrest or support the execution of those \r\nwarrants in accordance with the Rome Statute and their \r\ninternational obligations. Broader support will also be \r\nneeded in protecting witnesses and agreeing to enforce \r\nsentences. States which have not yet done so are \r\ninvited to enter into negotiations with the Court to \r\nconclude agreements on the protection of witnesses \r\nand the enforcement of sentences. \r\n Most critically, it is vital that States, international \r\norganizations and civil society continue to respect and \r\nto ensure respect for the Court’s independence and its \r\npurely judicial mandate. Their statements or their \r\nsilence in certain circumstances can have significant \r\nimpact on the effectiveness of the Court. Similarly, it is \r\nimportant to avoid any misperceptions with respect to \r\nthe judicial nature of the Court or to the relationship \r\nbetween justice and peace. The creation of the ICC in \r\n1998 was based on the conviction of States that justice \r\nand peace are complementary. The Court’s mandate \r\nand its independence must then be reaffirmed and \r\nrespected. It is particularly important to do so where \r\nthe circumstances seem difficult. \r\n As well as the tenth anniversary of the Rome \r\nConference, this year marks the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption by the General Assembly of two \r\ngroundbreaking legal texts: the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The \r\nformer made clear the fundamental and universally \r\naccepted principle that the prevention of the worst \r\ncrimes requires that perpetrators be punished. The \r\nlatter gave voice to the equally fundamental and \r\nuniversal principle that justice must be independent, \r\nimpartial and equally applied without distinction.  \r\n Those principles today are embodied in the Rome \r\nStatute, as was the will of States and in the activities of \r\nthe International Criminal Court. That there was need \r\nfor the Court is a testament to how often those \r\nprinciples were violated in the past.  \r\n That the Court was in fact created is a testament \r\nto the international community’s commitment to \r\nputting an end to impunity and to establishing a new \r\npolitics based on justice and the rule of law. How well \r\nwe succeed in realizing those commitments is up to us. \r\nThe Court will do its part, but the support of this \r\nbody — the General Assembly — and all of its \r\nMember States, which worked so tirelessly for the \r\ncreation of the Court, will be critical. \r\n Mr. Renié (France) (spoke in French): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The \r\ncandidate countries Croatia and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia, and the European Free Trade \r\nAssociation country Iceland, member of the European \r\nEconomic Area, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of \r\nMoldova and Armenia, align themselves with this \r\nstatement. \r\n I would first like to express my gratitude to the \r\nPresidents of the International Court of Justice and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for the submission \r\nof their respective reports (A/63/4 and A/63/323). The \r\nInternational Criminal Court’s fourth very \r\ncomprehensive report demonstrates that it is an active \r\ninstitution that is now able to accomplish the mission \r\nfor which it was established. \r\n In the period under review, namely, 2007 to 2008, \r\nthe International Criminal Court indeed made \r\nsubstantial progress in conducting investigations and \r\nprosecutions in the four ongoing proceedings, \r\ninvolving in particular the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, the Central African Republic and the Sudan. \r\nSignificant developments have also taken place in \r\ncourt proceedings. The Court has been asked to rule on \r\nprocedural issues that are critical to the trials ahead. \r\nThat is especially the case as regards the participation \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n7 08-58347 \r\n \r\nof victims and the rights of the defence, which are two \r\nfundamental aspects on which the judges had to rule as \r\npart of the case of The Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga \r\nDyilo. \r\n During the same period, the Court continued to \r\nenjoy the active and necessary support of States, \r\nprimarily the member States of the European Union, in \r\norder to promote the goal of universality, which \r\nunderpins the full application of the Rome Statute. \r\n The latest ratifications from Suriname and the \r\nCook Islands, which were very symbolic in that they \r\nwere made during the tenth anniversary \r\ncommemoration of the signing of the Rome Statute, \r\nhave helped bring the number of States parties to 108. \r\nThe progress also illustrates that the efforts made to \r\npromote the universality of the Rome Statute have been \r\nsuccessful. In that context, the European Union and its \r\nmember States are more willing than ever to maintain \r\ntheir support to ensure the membership of as many \r\nStates as possible and guarantee the integrity of the \r\nRome Statute. \r\n Effective cooperation with the International \r\nCriminal Court is essential to enable the Court to \r\naccomplish its mission, as evidenced by the arrests of \r\nGermain Katanga, Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui and Jean-\r\nPierre Bemba, which would not have been possible \r\nwithout the support of States parties. \r\n The action of the Court must continue to be \r\nmatched by all States, so as to ensure that persons \r\nsubject to an arrest warrant are handed over and that \r\njustice is served. In that regard, the European Union is \r\nfirmly committed to supporting the Court, so that all \r\narrest warrants are executed quickly, especially in \r\nDarfur and Uganda. It recalls the Government of the \r\nSudan’s obligation to cooperate with the Court under \r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 1593 \r\n(2005). The obligation to cooperate with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court is non-negotiable. The \r\nEuropean Union once again calls on the Government of \r\nthe Sudan to fully cooperate with the ICC in order to \r\nimplement the decisions of the Court. \r\n The European Union continues to believe that \r\ncombating impunity and realizing the Court’s \r\nobjectives also include implementing the principle of \r\ncomplementarity established by the Rome Statute. \r\nHowever, that principle presupposes that States have \r\nimplemented the provisions of the Statute at the \r\nnational level and that they have in place a judicial \r\nsystem that allows them to prosecute and try in the first \r\ninstance those who have committed the most serious \r\ncrimes on their territory. \r\n In that regard, in a context where the use of \r\nuniversal jurisdiction is currently under debate — and \r\nnot without some confusion — it is worth recalling that \r\nthe Court is an international court that draws its \r\nlegitimacy and prerogatives from the terms of an \r\ninternational treaty. \r\n Lastly, we should note that there have been \r\nsignificant new developments in relations between the \r\nEuropean Union and the Court: first, with the signing \r\nof a cooperation agreement in 2006, and then, last \r\nApril, with the formalization of arrangements for the \r\nexchange and protection of classified information. \r\nThose developments have paved the way for further \r\noperational cooperation. As the report indicates, an \r\noperation under the European Security and Defence \r\nPolicy, namely, the European Union military operations \r\nin Eastern Chad and North-Eastern Central African \r\nRepublic, will, for the first time, support the Court in \r\nChad, mainly in terms of security and logistics. \r\n I should now like to say a word regarding the \r\nfunctioning of the Court in order to welcome the \r\nelection of new judges and a new Registrar. In \r\naddition, we would like to emphasize that we believe \r\nthat the recent appointment of former ICC Judge \r\nNavanethem Pillay as United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights can only serve to \r\nstrengthen the natural link between the protection of \r\nhuman rights and international criminal justice. \r\n Finally, with regard to victims, the European \r\nUnion welcomes the Court’s advocacy and \r\ncommunication efforts, especially in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Uganda. We urge that those \r\nefforts be extended to all situations. \r\n The European Union is also pleased to note the \r\nparticipation of victims at trial. Being able to involve \r\ncivil society and to reach the people affected is indeed \r\nessential. We also hope that the work of the Trust Fund \r\nfor Victims will soon be fully visible to all and that it \r\nwill remind the victims of crimes within the \r\njurisdiction of the Court that the Statute was also \r\nestablished for them. \r\n The Court is a fundamental tool, both to combat \r\nimpunity when the most serious crimes undermining \r\nthe very essence of humankind are committed and to \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 8 \r\n \r\nprevent and deter the use of violence. The European \r\nUnion is, and will remain, firmly committed to the \r\nCourt in achieving those goals. \r\n Ms. Guy (Trinidad and Tobago): Trinidad and \r\nTobago has the honour and privilege to speak on behalf \r\nof the members of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) that are States parties to the Rome Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC) on the report \r\nof the Court contained in document A/63/323. We \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank Judge \r\nKirsch, President of the ICC, for his report on the work \r\nof the Court. \r\n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court. We were pleased to be part of the \r\nactivities that commemorated that landmark event here \r\nat United Nations Headquarters. During the \r\ncelebrations, we joined others in saluting the efforts of \r\nthe international community aimed at establishing the \r\nonly permanent international tribunal charged with \r\nprosecuting those accused of war crimes, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and genocide.  \r\n Of particular significance to us was the honour \r\nbestowed on former President and Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, The Honourable \r\nArthur N. R. Robinson, for his contribution to \r\ninternational criminal justice and his pioneering work, \r\ntogether with others, that led to the establishment of \r\nthe Court. We continue to play our part towards \r\nachieving the universality of the Rome Statute. In that \r\nregard, we also wish to congratulate Suriname on its \r\naccession to the Statute in July of this year. \r\n In a relatively short period, 108 States Members \r\nof the United Nations have become parties to the \r\nStatute and have undertaken to bring an end to \r\nimpunity by holding accountable those persons accused \r\nof committing crimes that shock the conscience of \r\nhumankind. Those States have conferred on the ICC \r\njurisdiction to prosecute those crimes referred to in \r\narticle 5 of the Statute. Over the past 10 years, the ICC \r\nhas shown that it is an independent and impartial \r\ntribunal with a bench of highly qualified judges and a \r\ncadre of competent professional staff. \r\n The achievements of the Court in respect of \r\nmatters emanating from the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, Uganda, the Sudan and the Central African \r\nRepublic show that it is at the centre of the system of \r\ninternational criminal justice. The ICC has surpassed \r\nthe expectations of its supporters and dumbfounded \r\nsome of its staunchest detractors.  \r\n The Court continues to demonstrate fairness and \r\nimpartiality, and at the same time it has scrupulously \r\nobserved the fundamental tenets of due process. Such \r\nimpartiality and independence were observed in the \r\ncase of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, where Trial Chamber I \r\nissued a stay of proceedings and ordered the \r\nunconditional release of Mr. Lubanga, subject to \r\nappellate proceedings. We eagerly await the outcome \r\nof the case, which has been referred back to the Trial \r\nChamber for determination by the Appeals Chamber. \r\nWe remain firm believers in the integrity of the judicial \r\nprocess and the neutrality of the judges. \r\n Without the cooperation of States parties, it \r\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, for the ICC to \r\nfulfil its mandate. We are of the view that States must \r\nrespect their treaty obligations and cooperate with the \r\nCourt to the benefit of all of us who are advocates for \r\njustice, and especially to bring relief to the hapless \r\nvictims of crime. The effective and timely cooperation \r\nof States parties is essential to the execution of arrest \r\nwarrants, the surrender of accused persons and the \r\nprotection and relocation of witnesses. The cooperation \r\nof States would also ensure that the rights of victims to \r\nparticipate in the trials of alleged offenders are not \r\ncompromised. We therefore call on all States parties, \r\nespecially situation countries, to cooperate fully with \r\nthe Court in the interest of promoting international \r\npeace and justice and an end to impunity. Nonetheless, \r\nwe recognize the progress made by the Court in \r\nconducting its business with the aid of States parties \r\nand other entities. \r\n We nevertheless must stress that it would be \r\ndifficult, especially in situation countries, to promote a \r\nregime of international peace and justice without \r\ncooperation with the Court. Peace and justice are twin \r\nideals that are recognized in both the United Nations \r\nCharter and the Rome Statute. The pursuit of either one \r\nmust never be allowed to imperil the attainment of the \r\nother. \r\n The Rome Statute contemplates an ICC that has \r\ncomplementary jurisdiction with those of national \r\ncourts. States parties have an obligation to implement \r\nin their domestic legal systems legislation to give full \r\neffect to their obligations under the Statute. \r\nConsequently, we request that States parties take the \r\nnecessary measures to enact domestic legislation, in \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n9 08-58347 \r\n \r\nkeeping with their commitments under the Statute, as \r\nsoon as possible. Additionally, we also appeal to States \r\nthat have not as yet done so to ratify the Agreement on \r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the ICC. \r\n The preamble to the Rome Statute contemplates \r\ncooperation between the ICC and the United Nations. \r\nDuring the past year, we have witnessed increased \r\ncooperation between both bodies, most notably in the \r\nCentral African Republic and the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo. Such collaboration is further testimony \r\nto the importance of multilateral initiatives in \r\naddressing issues of grave concern to all members of \r\nthe international community.  \r\n Moreover, pursuant to the provisions of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the ICC, the United Nations was able to provide \r\nfacilities and services for the successful hosting of both \r\nthe sixth and the resumed sixth sessions of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties. The hosting of the \r\nAssembly at United Nations Headquarters has resulted \r\nin increased participation by States parties and \r\nenhanced the visibility of the Court to the wider United \r\nNations system. \r\n Article 36 of the Rome Statute provides for very \r\ncomplex criteria for the election of judges to the ICC. \r\nCARICOM States parties recognize the need for the \r\nCourt to have judges who not only are highly qualified \r\nand of high moral character, but who also possess the \r\nrequisite experience in international law, or criminal \r\nlaw and procedure, and who qualify for appointment to \r\nthe highest judicial offices in their countries. We \r\nstrongly believe that any derogation from those \r\nstandards could negatively affect the ability of the \r\nCourt to adjudicate on those crimes provided for in \r\narticle 5 of the Rome Statute.  \r\n It is for that reason that CARICOM has endorsed \r\nthe candidature of Justice Mohamed Shahabbudeen of \r\nGuyana for election as a judge of the ICC at the \r\nelections scheduled for the resumed seventh session of \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties in January 2009. That \r\ncandidature has also been endorsed by the Group of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States. Justice \r\nShahabbudeen has served as a judge on the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and is currently a judge \r\nin the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda, as well as a judge on the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former \r\nYugoslavia. We would therefore welcome the support \r\nof all States parties for the candidature of that \r\nillustrious and eminently qualified jurist. \r\n In conclusion, CARICOM States parties reiterate \r\nour commitment to the principles and objectives \r\nenshrined in the Rome Statute of the ICC. We remain \r\nconvinced that an important pillar in the maintenance \r\nand promotion of the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels is the existence of a permanent \r\ninternational criminal tribunal with jurisdiction to \r\nprosecute all those whose actions undermine \r\ninternational peace and security. The imminent closure \r\nof the ad hoc tribunals established by the Security \r\nCouncil makes the ICC an essential element of the \r\ninternational criminal justice system. There must be no \r\nsafe haven for the perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community. We \r\nwill continue to work with States and other entities to \r\nprovide for a strong, independent and effective ICC \r\nthat we can bequeath to future generations. \r\n Mr. Hill (Australia): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of Canada, New Zealand and Australia \r\n(CANZ). We thank Judge Philippe Kirsch, President of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), for his \r\npresentation of the report of the important work of the \r\nICC. \r\n The Court, in our view, is making significant \r\nsteps forward. In the past year, the Court has issued \r\nfour new warrants of arrest — three in the situation in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and one in the \r\nsituation in the Central African Republic. CANZ \r\nwelcomes and commends the actions of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo in surrendering Germain \r\nKatanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui to the Court and \r\nBelgium in arresting and surrendering Jean-Pierre \r\nBemba Gombo to the Court. Those surrenders provide \r\nexamples of the results that can be achieved through \r\nclose cooperation with the Court. \r\n CANZ recognizes that the Court continues to face \r\nchallenges, particularly where it is entirely reliant on \r\ncooperation and support from others to fulfil its \r\nmandate. It is of the utmost importance that States rise \r\nto meet those challenges. Failure to do so risks the \r\ninternational community betraying the victims of \r\nserious crimes. CANZ encourages all States to assist \r\nthe Court through practical measures. \r\n CANZ also calls upon all relevant actors, \r\nincluding the authorities in Uganda and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, to cooperate closely with the \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 10 \r\n \r\nCourt and one another in ensuring the full \r\nimplementation of their obligations under the Rome \r\nStatute, including the execution of outstanding arrest \r\nwarrants, and in assisting the Court to fulfil its \r\nmandate. \r\n We again call on the Government of the Sudan to \r\nhelp bring an end to impunity for the most serious \r\ninternational crimes. In particular, we urge the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan to cooperate with the Court \r\nand to take all necessary steps to arrest Minister of \r\nState for Humanitarian Affairs Ahmad Harun and to \r\ntransfer him and militia leader Ali Kushayb to the \r\nCourt for trial. Acting on the arrest warrants will \r\ndemonstrate not only respect for the rule of law, but \r\nalso support for international criminal justice generally. \r\n The judicial work of the Court has continued \r\napace, with preparations for trials continuing and the \r\nCourt deciding on the confirmation of charges and \r\napplications for victim participation. Those are all \r\nsigns of a Court that is conducting itself professionally, \r\nexpeditiously, without political interference and \r\naccording to its mandate. \r\n Universal ratification of the Rome Statute is \r\ncrucial to the Court’s success. If we are to ensure that \r\nthe perpetrators of the world’s most egregious crimes \r\nare denied a safe haven, we must step up our collective \r\nefforts to promote the universality of the Rome Statute. \r\nWe are pleased that there have been three additional \r\nratifications and accessions to the Rome Statute in the \r\npast year. We welcome Madagascar, Suriname and the \r\nCook Islands as parties to the Rome Statute. It is \r\nnotable that there are now 108 States parties — over 55 \r\nper cent of the United Nations membership. \r\n CANZ have continued its efforts at the regional \r\nlevel to encourage further ratification. Australia and \r\nNew Zealand, for example, have worked over the past \r\nyear with Pacific island States to encourage their \r\nratification and implementation of the Rome Statute. In \r\nAugust, New Zealand and Australia participated in a \r\nregional seminar held by the Samoan Government to \r\nraise awareness of the Court and develop a model \r\nPacific law for the Statute’s implementation. \r\n Since September 2000, Canada’s Global Peace \r\nand Security Fund has provided more than $10 million \r\nin funding to support events and projects that promote \r\nratification and implementation of the Rome Statute, \r\nassist with the effective functioning of the Court and \r\nother international criminal tribunals, and provide \r\neducation and outreach related to the Court and other \r\ninternational criminal tribunals. Through the Fund, \r\nCanada supported the publication of the third edition of \r\nthe Manual for the Ratification and Implementation of \r\nthe Rome Statute. \r\n On 17 July 2008, we celebrated the tenth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute. The \r\nanniversary provided an opportunity to reflect on the \r\nCourt’s achievements and reinforce our collective \r\nsupport for it. In that relatively short period of time, \r\nthe Court has established itself as a central institution \r\nof international criminal justice. \r\n Providing a permanent, impartial and fair process \r\nfor the investigation and prosecution of those accused \r\nof serious international crimes is a key component in \r\nthe fight for international justice. We are convinced \r\nthat having mechanisms to promote and ensure justice \r\nin conflict situations can only contribute to sustainable \r\npeace. \r\n As noted earlier, the Court has now reached a \r\ncrucial stage of its development, and it has become \r\nclear that the establishment of a global justice system \r\nbrings with it many challenges. The Court needs our \r\nfull support and cooperation to bring individuals \r\nresponsible for the most serious violations of \r\ninternational law to justice without delay. In particular, \r\nwe must ensure that any use of article 16 to defer cases \r\nis only contemplated in exceptional circumstances. To \r\nfail to do so would represent a failure to ensure justice \r\nfor egregious international crimes. \r\n With the Court now six years old, we are firmly \r\non the path to justice being a reality for perpetrators of \r\nserious crimes worldwide. That path will lead to \r\nenhanced respect for, and adherence to, the \r\ninternational rule of law. CANZ will continue to \r\nprovide the Court with our strong and unwavering \r\nsupport. We call on all Member States to do the same. \r\n In closing, it would be remiss of me, on the \r\noccasion of President Kirsch’s final report to this \r\nAssembly, not to express, on behalf of CANZ, our deep \r\nappreciation for his impressive leadership of the Court \r\nover its formative years and to wish him well in his \r\nfuture endeavours. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation would first like to thank President Philippe \r\nKirsch for his presentation of the fourth annual report \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC) (see \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n11 08-58347 \r\n \r\nA/63/323), reviewing the Court’s work and the main \r\nfacts concerning its relations with the United Nations. \r\nWe would also like to express our gratitude to all the \r\nstaff members of the Court for their work and for their \r\ndaily efforts to accomplish their extremely difficult \r\ntasks. \r\n While the Statute provides the Court with the \r\nlegal means to fulfil its tasks, it does not grant it the \r\ncompetence to implement its decisions. The Court \r\ntherefore relies heavily on the cooperation of States to \r\naccomplish its tasks. In that regard, we very much \r\nwelcome the cooperation of certain States, which has, \r\nin particular, made possible the transfer, in the course \r\nof the year under review, of three defendants in \r\nconnection with the situations in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the Central African \r\nRepublic.  \r\n However, we are concerned that at the moment no \r\nless than seven arrest warrants are still pending \r\nexecution. In that connection, my delegation would \r\nlike to reiterate that, in accordance with the Rome \r\nStatute and obligations under the Charter of the United \r\nNations, it is the responsibility of States to support the \r\nCourt and to cooperate fully with it. Without the \r\ncooperation of States, the Court will simply not be able \r\nto fulfil the mandate that has been entrusted to it. \r\n As underlined in the report presented by \r\nPresident Kirsch (see A/63/323), the cooperation of \r\nStates is not limited to the execution of arrest warrants \r\nbut also covers other activities, such as the protection \r\nof witnesses. That cooperation concerns in particular \r\nthose States affected by situations being examined by \r\nthe Court, as well as their neighbouring States. \r\nSwitzerland considers the protection of witnesses to be \r\na central element in the proper administration of \r\ninternational criminal justice. We therefore commend \r\nthe measures taken and the new methods of protection \r\nput in place, in cooperation with national and local \r\nauthorities, to strengthen witness protection. \r\n Also in the area of cooperation, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the continuing collaboration between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Court. That cooperation is \r\nessential at several levels, especially for the facilitation \r\nof the Court’s operations on the ground. It is \r\nimperative that it should continue in the future. \r\n Over the past year, some criticism of the Court \r\nhas been voiced in connection with the institution of \r\nproceedings and with requests for arrest warrants. My \r\ndelegation believes that such criticism is proof and \r\nexample of the fact that the Court today is well \r\nestablished and anchored in the international system \r\nand that its activities have a tangible impact. The \r\ndebates with regard to the Court demonstrate the \r\nimportance and the relevance that it has acquired since \r\nthe adoption of its Statute 10 years ago. \r\n Finally, my delegation would like to reiterate that \r\nSwitzerland continues to believe that justice and peace \r\nare mutually reinforcing and fundamentally \r\ncomplementary, and even inextricably linked. \r\nInternational criminal justice is a key element in the \r\nfight against impunity and in the strengthening of the \r\nrule of law. Those elements are central in all societies \r\nthat have experienced the devastation of war. The most \r\nserious crimes affecting the international community as \r\na whole must not go unpunished. There can be no \r\ndoubt that the prosecution of those crimes contributes \r\nto peace and reconciliation. That is why Switzerland \r\nbelieves that peace processes that aim at establishing \r\nlasting peace and security cannot dispense with justice. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to stress once again \r\nthat Switzerland remains committed to and continues \r\nto support the Court, its activities and its \r\nindependence. \r\n Mr. Barriga (Liechtenstein): We would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), Mr. Philippe Kirsch, for presenting the report of \r\nthe ICC (see A/63/323) to the General Assembly.  \r\n We are satisfied that the Court has continued to \r\nmake progress in its judicial work, considering in \r\nparticular that in the early stages of its life the Court \r\nhas had to take difficult decisions that will serve as \r\nprecedents for many years to come.  \r\n We particularly welcome the additional arrests \r\nmade with respect to the situations in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the Central African \r\nRepublic. During the reporting period, the number of \r\nsuspects in custody of the Court rose from one to four. \r\nIt is expected that up to three trials will take place in \r\n2009. At the same time, we are gravely concerned that \r\nseven arrest warrants are still awaiting execution; some \r\nof them have waited for more than three years. \r\n The Court today shows many signs of being a \r\nhealthy judicial institution, including a vibrant legal \r\ndialogue between its organs as several cases move \r\nalong. That should be encouraging for States parties \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 12 \r\n \r\nand observers alike. It may be true that the \r\nProsecutor’s actions receive the greatest attention in \r\nthe media, as is often the case with judicial institutions, \r\nbut the actual record of the Court over the past year \r\nshows that there is a clear balance between all the \r\norgans of the Court, as envisaged by the Rome Statute.  \r\n At every step of the proceedings, decisions are \r\ndelivered by judges acting in chambers — collegial \r\norgans composed of fully independent and impartial \r\npersonalities representing all the regions and legal \r\nsystems of the world, with almost half of them being \r\nwomen. We fully trust their capabilities and integrity, \r\nwhich they have proven many times already during the \r\nfirst years of the Court’s existence, in the interests of \r\ndue process and justice. \r\n While the Court has continued to fulfil its \r\nmandate under the Rome Statute and in accordance \r\nwith the United Nations Charter, its activities have \r\nreceived extraordinary attention in the public sphere \r\nover the past months. That is particularly true for the \r\nProsecutor’s application for a warrant of arrest against \r\nthe President of the Sudan, which is currently under \r\nconsideration by a pre-trial chamber. As a State party \r\nto the Rome Statute, we fully respect the independence \r\nof the Court and will therefore not comment on the \r\nspecifics of cases before the Court.  \r\n We have also on several occasions commented on \r\nwhat is often, in simplistic terms, referred to as the \r\nquestion of peace versus justice, which would require \r\nits own separate debate. Our views on that complex \r\nissue are well known. They are based on the principle \r\nthat amnesty or any other form of impunity for \r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are \r\nunacceptable under international law. We would, \r\nhowever, like to take this opportunity to comment on \r\nquestions raised in that context regarding the \r\njurisdiction of the Court.  \r\n The ICC is an independent judicial institution \r\nestablished by a treaty, the Rome Statute. At the same \r\ntime, however, its jurisdiction is in principle based on \r\ntwo different and separate legal authorities. On the one \r\nhand, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction on the \r\nbasis of the consent of States, most importantly via the \r\nratification of the Rome Statute or a special declaration \r\nto that effect. Three out of the four current cases are \r\nbased on such State consent. In fact, those three States \r\nhave specifically asked the Court to open \r\ninvestigations into crimes committed on their territory.  \r\n On the other hand, the Court may exercise \r\njurisdiction on the basis of a Chapter VII mandate by \r\nthe Security Council. In that instance, the ICC acts \r\nvery much like an ad hoc tribunal established by the \r\nSecurity Council itself. The obligation for all States \r\nconcerned to cooperate with the investigation emanates \r\nnot solely from the Rome Statute, but from a Security \r\nCouncil resolution — such as resolution 1593 (2005), \r\nreferring the situation in Darfur to the ICC. That \r\nobligation to cooperate is firmly rooted in the United \r\nNations Charter and is in principle not any different \r\nfrom the obligation to cooperate with the Tribunals for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. We therefore \r\ncall on all States concerned to abide by their \r\nobligations under international law and to cooperate \r\nfully with the Court. \r\n We welcome the new States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, bringing its number to 108 and thus another \r\nstep closer to universality. We also respect the \r\napproach of some States that continue to evaluate the \r\nmerits of ratification or accession. We encourage them, \r\nonce again, to enter into a dialogue with the Court and \r\nwith other States parties on related questions. We \r\nwould suggest that the argument I made earlier \r\nregarding the two distinct bases for the Court’s \r\njurisdiction also has important implications for any \r\nnon-State party assessing the value of joining the Rome \r\nStatute. \r\n As a matter of fact, every State in the world is \r\nalready potentially subject to the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nby way of a Security Council referral. In that sense, \r\nevery State is already part of this common venture to \r\nend impunity, and incurs important legal obligations. \r\nHowever, only States parties to the Rome Statute are \r\nalso rewarded with important rights. States parties find \r\nthemselves under the protection of the Court, which \r\nmay open investigations into crimes committed on a \r\nState party’s territory, thereby contributing to the \r\nprevention of such crimes. That protection applies not \r\nonly to crimes committed by nationals of States parties, \r\nbut also to crimes committed by foreign forces.  \r\n Furthermore, States parties have the right to \r\ncontribute to the institutional framework of the Court, \r\ninter alia; by nominating and electing judges and other \r\nsenior officials and by deciding on the Court’s budget. \r\nThe Rome Statute provides an elaborate system of \r\naccountability in which States Parties play a central \r\nrole.  \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n13 08-58347 \r\n \r\n In sum, becoming a State party to the Rome \r\nStatute brings clear benefits to any State that is \r\ncommitted to preventing and punishing genocide, war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity on its territory. In \r\nturn, every ratification of the Rome Statute constitutes \r\nanother step towards more effective rule of law at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n I would like to emphasize that Liechtenstein has \r\nbeen a long-standing supporter of the International \r\nCriminal Court and that we are proud to have been \r\nentrusted with the presidency of the Assembly of States \r\nParties for the next three sessions. During that time, \r\nStates parties will discuss possible amendments to the \r\nRome Statute, most prominently with respect to the \r\ncrime of aggression. The Review Conference at which \r\nthe respective decisions will be made is now only \r\nabout a year and a half away. We encourage all \r\ndelegations to continue to participate actively and with \r\na constructive spirit in its preparation. The Conference \r\nhas the potential to turn the Rome Statute into an even \r\ngreater achievement than it already is today. \r\n Mr. Chávez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, Judge Philippe Kirsch, for being with us today \r\nand for his interesting presentation on the work of the \r\nCourt in the past year. \r\n On 17 July, we commemorated the tenth \r\nanniversary of the establishment of the International \r\nCriminal Court. Significant progress has been made \r\nsince the Court took up its functions on 1 July 2002, \r\nbut the Court, States and the United Nations still have a \r\nlong way to go.  \r\n First of all, true universality must be achieved. \r\nUnfortunately, many States still have neither ratified \r\nnor acceded to the Rome Statute. Peru therefore calls \r\non those States that have not yet done so to ratify or \r\naccede to the Statute in order to give it a truly universal \r\nscope. \r\n Moreover, if the Court is to achieve its \r\nobjectives, the cooperation of States is also necessary. \r\nIn that regard, States must comply with their \r\nobligations under the Rome Statute by facilitating the \r\nexchange of information; enforcing the warrants issued \r\nby the Court; detaining the accused and, when \r\nnecessary, transferring them to the Court; protecting \r\nwitnesses and victims; and implementing and aligning \r\ntheir national laws with the Statute. It is therefore of \r\nconcern that individuals for whom the International \r\nCriminal Court has issued warrants of arrest have not \r\nyet been detained for trial or delivery to the Court. \r\nPeru urges those States wherein those individuals are \r\nlocated to cooperate with the Court, to immediately \r\ndetain them or to provide information on their possible \r\nlocation. We recall that there can be no lasting peace or \r\nsecurity if the perpetrators of crimes enjoy impunity.  \r\n With regard to the progress made in Peru’s \r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Court, I \r\nnote that my country has already integrated a section \r\npertaining to international judicial cooperation into our \r\ncriminal procedural code, which is dedicated to the \r\nfurther development of part 9 of the Rome Statute to \r\nensure its effective implementation. Such concrete \r\naction can be replicated and we therefore call upon \r\nthose States that have not yet done so to implement the \r\nRome Statute in their national laws.  \r\n With regard to cooperation between the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and the United Nations, \r\nthe Relationship Agreement between both institutions \r\nhas enabled the Court to accomplish valuable work, \r\nparticularly in those regions where the United Nations \r\nis operating in the field, and to publicize and raise \r\nawareness of the Court’s work. We trust that such \r\ncooperation will be increasingly close and coordinated \r\nso that the Court can draw on the support of the \r\ndifferent organs of the United Nations, especially the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Mr. Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n However, the Court needs more than such \r\nsupport. It also needs its own premises in order to be \r\nable to carry out its work in the best possible \r\nconditions. For that reason, Peru wishes to thank the \r\nOversight Committee for its work in preparing for the \r\nestablishment of the headquarters of the Court. We \r\nhope that at the next meeting of the States parties \r\nefforts will continue to ensure that the construction of \r\nthe Court’s headquarters may begin shortly. \r\n During the current judicial year, 3,443 \r\ncommunications were received in accordance with \r\narticle 15 of the Rome Statute. We also wish to \r\nunderscore that States and the Security Council alike \r\nhave referred situations for consideration to the Court. \r\nThat deserves the attention of the international \r\ncommunity, as those situations may include potential \r\ncases of war crimes, crimes of genocide or crimes \r\nagainst humanity. Therefore, Peru wishes to reaffirm \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 14 \r\n \r\nits full support for the work of the International \r\nCriminal Court, and wishes in particular to \r\nacknowledge the outstanding work of the judges and \r\nofficials who are working in the fight against impunity \r\nand thus towards peace, security and the well-being of \r\nhumankind. \r\n Finally, one pending task is the definition of the \r\ncrime of aggression. The work accomplished by the \r\nSpecial Working Group on the Crime of Aggression \r\nhas made a valuable contribution in this regard. Peru \r\nhopes that, at the seventh session of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties to the Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court, further substantial progress can be \r\nmade towards defining the crime of aggression with a \r\nview to the upcoming Rome Statute Review \r\nConference in 2009. \r\n Mr. Pírez Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ncountry has supported and will continue to support the \r\nestablishment of an impartial, non-selective, efficient \r\nand just International Criminal Court that complements \r\nnational justice systems, is truly independent and free \r\nfrom subordination to political interests that could \r\ndistort its essence. \r\n The International Criminal Court’s lack of \r\nindependence is a cause for concern, given how its \r\nrelationship with the Security Council has been \r\ndefined. Article 16 of the Rome Statute grants power to \r\nthe Council to suspend the Court’s investigations or \r\nindictments, and article 5 purports that the future \r\nregulation of jurisdiction of the Criminal Court’s be \r\nsubject to the Security Council’s determination of \r\nwhether or not an act of aggression has been \r\ncommitted by a State. Those two elements cast doubt \r\non the true efficiency and independence of the Court. \r\n The Cuban delegation has participated with \r\nparticular interest in all phases of the process to \r\nestablish the International Criminal Court and \r\nrecognizes the relevance of the Rome Statute to \r\ninternational law. However, even the most modest \r\nexpectations raised at the outset of the process, such as \r\nthe elaboration of a definition of the crime of \r\naggression, have not yet been met. We hope that the \r\nSpecial Working Group on the Crime of Aggression, \r\nwhich is open to participation by all United Nations \r\nMember States on an equal footing, can satisfactorily \r\ncomplete as soon as possible its work to draft a broadly \r\naccepted definition of that crime that will permit its \r\nperpetrators to be tried and sentenced. In that \r\nconnection, we believe that the Assembly of States \r\nParties should give the Working Group more \r\nopportunities to function by allocating it more time in \r\nits programme of work and by holding intersessional \r\nmeetings if necessary.  \r\n For Cuba, a small country that is under an \r\neconomic and financial blockade and that has been a \r\nvictim of constant aggression by the greatest Power in \r\nhistory, it is very difficult to accede the Rome Statute \r\nwithout a clear and precise definition of the crime of \r\naggression. We continue to hold a constructive position \r\non the establishment of an international criminal \r\njustice system that is truly impartial, efficient, \r\nindependent and complementary to national \r\njurisdictions. In that connection, we have followed \r\nwith interest the development and functioning of this \r\nnew institution through, inter alia, our participation as \r\nobserver in meetings of the Assembly of States Parties \r\nto the Rome Statute. \r\n My delegation reaffirms its readiness to \r\ncontribute to the application of truly effective \r\ninternational criminal justice that abides by the norms \r\nof international law and, in particular, the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Mr. Barttfeld (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina expresses its appreciation and gratitude to \r\nMr. Philippe Kirsch, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, for presenting the fourth report of the \r\nCourt to the General Assembly (see A/63/323). \r\n This year, we are pleased to celebrate the tenth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute and \r\nthe recognition in the field of international law that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court has achieved since then. \r\nThe fight against impunity for crimes against humanity, \r\ngenocide and war crimes is one of the elements that \r\nhave contributed most to the achievement of peace and \r\nstability in international relations. There can be no true \r\nnational reconciliation in countries in conflict or during \r\nthe subsequent peacebuilding phase, if we do not \r\nensure adherence to those universal values by bringing \r\nto justice all perpetrators of such crimes without \r\ndistinction. That linkage was stressed by Argentina on \r\nmany occasions when it was a Security Council \r\nmember in 2005 and 2006. \r\n There are a number of positive elements to \r\nhighlight in the report, which covers the period \r\n1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008. While the Rome \r\nStatute had received 60 ratifications by 2002, 108 \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n15 08-58347 \r\n \r\nStates are now parties as of this year. That \r\ndemonstrates that the efforts to achieve the universality \r\nand full implementation of the Rome Statute are \r\nproducing results. It should also be stressed that 63 \r\nStates have already become parties or signatories to the \r\nAgreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Court. \r\n During the period covered by the report, the \r\nsituations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nUganda, Darfur in the Sudan, and the Central African \r\nRepublic were referred to the Court, and legal actions \r\nwere initiated in each of those cases. Three of those \r\nfour States referred the situations to the Court \r\nthemselves. However, the Court depends on the \r\ncooperation of States, international organizations and \r\ncivil society in carrying out its work. While three \r\npersons were handed over to the Court, enabling it to \r\ntake legal action against all of them, we are concerned \r\nthat there are still seven outstanding arrest warrants.  \r\n There has been some progress in the area of \r\ncooperation, which is reflected, for example, in the \r\nsupport that the Court has received from the United \r\nNations field missions in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and the Central African Republic. We \r\nshould also highlight the headquarters agreement \r\nbetween the International Criminal Court and the host \r\ncountry, which entered into force on 3 March 2008. It \r\nhas strengthened cooperation and facilitated the \r\nCourt’s functioning in The Hague. \r\n As the Court has no police force of its own, \r\ncooperation among States, the United Nations, regional \r\norganizations and other actors is essential if we are to \r\nattain the objectives set out in the preamble of the \r\nRome Statute by the States parties. That is why, at the \r\nend of 2006, Argentina implemented, within the \r\nframework of its domestic legislation, the provisions of \r\nthe Rome Statute and relations of cooperation between \r\nthe Argentine State and the International Criminal \r\nCourt and ratified the Agreement on Privileges and \r\nImmunities of the Court, enabling the Court to carry \r\nout its work without impediments on Argentine \r\nterritory. \r\n Finally, because the purposes and principles set \r\nout in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt reflect those of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand are therefore universal, Argentina urges all States \r\nthat have not yet done so to accede to or ratify the \r\nRome Statute in order to guarantee the universality of \r\nthe fight against impunity. \r\n Mr. Moeletsi (Lesotho): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of my delegation. We warmly welcome \r\nJudge Philippe Kirsch, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, and thank him for his presentation \r\ntoday. We also wish to register our highest regard and \r\nrecognition with respect to the elaborate report (see \r\nA/63/323) that was presented today to the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session.  \r\n Lesotho maintains that a balanced and \r\nconstructive relationship between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court is extremely \r\nvaluable, as it ensures the well-being of the Court \r\nwhile preserving the independence that it should have \r\nto ensure its proper functioning. My country is \r\ncommitted to the mandate of the Court and will \r\ncontinue to support endeavours to ensure an effective, \r\nimpartial, non-selective, efficient and just Court that \r\npromotes and protects the interests of all States parties \r\nto the Rome Statute of the Court.  \r\n It is our considered view that the Court has \r\nalready demonstrated its positive impact in identifying \r\nthe perpetrators of systematic atrocities, thus \r\nstrengthening the system of international justice and \r\nmaking an important contribution to the search for \r\npeace and the promotion of democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw. It will be noted, however, that those tangible \r\nmilestones are being realized by the Court despite its \r\nhandicap of having limited powers in some instances. \r\nTo my delegation, that only reaffirms the importance of \r\nUnited Nations and State cooperation aimed at the \r\nfuture effectiveness of the Court. \r\n My delegation believes that the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the Court \r\nprovides many avenues for mutually beneficial \r\ncooperative efforts to establish the rule of law and to \r\nend impunity. Ending crimes of impunity requires \r\ndetermined cooperation on the part of interlocutors \r\nwho have international peace, justice and security as \r\ntheir common goals and aspirations. Cooperation is \r\nnecessary in the fields of communication, \r\ntransportation, logistics and security, including \r\nprotection of victims, witnesses and investigators, and \r\nin providing access to suspects and enabling the \r\ncollection of evidence and documents. \r\n Lesotho is a strong supporter of the International \r\nCriminal Court and has consistently and actively \r\ndefended the integrity of the Rome Statute, and it will \r\ncontinue to do so. The establishment of the Court is \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 16 \r\n \r\nbeyond doubt the most significant development in \r\nrecent years in the long struggle to eradicate impunity \r\nfor the most serious international crimes and thereby \r\nadvance the cause of justice and the rule of law.  \r\n That point brings me to address an issue of \r\nconcern to my delegation that was clearly articulated \r\nby the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lesotho, \r\nMr. Mohlabi Kenneth Tsekoa in the plenary of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session on \r\n27 September 2008. The issue in question relates to the \r\nabuse of the principle of universal jurisdiction. The \r\nSharm el-Sheikh Assembly of the African Union was \r\nseized with the issue of the abuse of the principle of \r\nuniversal jurisdiction by some countries that seem \r\ninclined to use this principle to target certain African \r\nLeaders. \r\n We recognize that universal jurisdiction is a \r\nprinciple of international law, the purpose of which is \r\nto ensure that individuals who commit grave offences, \r\nsuch as genocide, war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity, and who have heretofore enjoyed impunity \r\nare brought to justice. This noble principle should be \r\nimpartially and objectively applied, so that it may not \r\nbe abused for the political ends of some individuals or \r\ncountries, as that could endanger international order \r\nand security. It is a well known fact that the application \r\nof this principle by individual States has been rendered \r\nunnecessary by the creation of the International \r\nCriminal Court.  \r\n If a State is unable or unwilling to deal with \r\ncertain grave situations, such a matter should be \r\nreferred to the International Court, which would deal \r\nwith it impartially. Even the Security Council refers \r\ncertain situations to the Court. We need only emphasize \r\nthat the International Criminal Court was created by \r\nthis world body and must enjoy the support and trust of \r\nthe entire membership of the United Nations. It must \r\nalso be immune from external influences. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to reiterate \r\nthat Judge Philippe Kirsch’s report has reflected \r\ncontinued commitment to international criminal justice \r\nand to the importance of the rule of law in the United \r\nNations system and in the international community at \r\nlarge. \r\n Mrs. Juul (Norway): Let me start by expressing \r\nNorway’s ongoing support for and full recognition of \r\nthe work of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nduring the past year. Norway welcomes the Court’s \r\nfourth annual report and would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Court, Judge Philippe Kirsch, for the \r\ndetailed and informative report (see A/63/323) and his \r\npresentation, which reflect the progress made during \r\nthe period under review. \r\n This July, the States parties to the Rome Statute \r\nalong with civil society organizations celebrated the \r\ntenth anniversary of the adoption of the Statute. \r\nCelebrations were held in a number of locations to \r\ncommemorate the milestone reached ten years ago \r\nwhen a Court was created that would prevent impunity \r\nfor mass atrocities and bring perpetrators of such \r\ncrimes to justice when national systems were not able \r\nor willing to do so. \r\n The relationship between the International \r\nCriminal Court and the United Nations is of great \r\nimportance. Bringing a climate of impunity to an end \r\nrequires determined cooperation between actors who \r\nhave international peace, justice and security as their \r\ncommon goals and ambition. The International \r\nCriminal Court is independent, but has strong legal, \r\nhistorical and operational ties with the United Nations. \r\n The United Nations seeks to promote both peace \r\nand justice based on human rights. These are distinct \r\nbut closely related objectives. They may be difficult to \r\nachieve simultaneously, but we must strive to do so. In \r\nthis quest, the International Criminal Court is an \r\neffective and important tool for ending impunity and \r\npromoting the rule of law. \r\n The interplay between the International Criminal \r\nCourt and the United Nations is made clear, both in the \r\nRome Statute itself and in the Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the two parties. The preamble of the Rome \r\nStatute reaffirms the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. In particular, all States \r\nshall refrain from the threat or use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any \r\nState, or in any other manner inconsistent with the \r\npurposes of the United Nations.  \r\n Norway welcomes the strengthening of the \r\nrelationship between the International Criminal Court \r\nand the United Nations. We urge all States and \r\ninternational organizations to support the Court and the \r\nUnited Nations in their efforts to reach their common \r\ngoals. Justice is also an important building block for \r\npeace, and the international community must ensure \r\nthat the foundation for peace is solid and stands the test \r\nof time. \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n17 08-58347 \r\n \r\n The mere existence of the International Criminal \r\nCourt is making a significant impact on national \r\nsystems, which are increasingly geared towards \r\nprevention and prosecution. The success of the \r\nInternational Court should therefore never be evaluated \r\nsolely on the basis of the number of cases it hears. The \r\nsuccess of the Rome Statute should be measured in \r\nterms of the overall decrease in impunity for such \r\ncrimes and not in terms of the number of defendants \r\nbrought to The Hague. Moreover, whenever national \r\nauthorities investigate, prosecute or issue judgements \r\nin cases involving serious international crimes, that in \r\nitself reaffirms the core objective of the International \r\nCriminal Court, namely that perpetrators of such \r\ncrimes be held accountable. \r\n However, when national systems are not willing \r\nor able to bring perpetrators to justice, the principle  \r\nof complementarity provides a safety net. This \r\nmechanism requires international cooperation, which is \r\nof the utmost importance to the activities of the Court. \r\nThis idea is also stressed in the report itself. \r\n During the period under review, three individuals \r\nwere surrendered to the International Criminal Court, \r\nenabling the Court to begin judicial proceedings \r\nagainst each of them. However, seven arrest warrants \r\npertaining to the situations in Darfur, Uganda and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo remain outstanding. \r\nThis situation is a matter of grave concern for Norway. \r\n The credibility of the Court is not solely \r\ndependent on the number of cases brought before it. \r\nNevertheless, the outstanding arrest warrants, four of \r\nwhich have been outstanding for over three years, give \r\ncause for concern. We urge all the States involved to \r\nfulfil their obligation to make these warrants effective.  \r\n With regard to the situation in Darfur, the \r\nProsecutor has reported to the Security Council that the \r\nSudanese Government, in the period under review, is \r\nstill failing to comply with its legal obligations under \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1593 (2005). We therefore \r\nurge the Sudan to cooperate fully with the Court and to \r\ncomply with its legal obligations without further delay. \r\n We are pleased to note that, with the entry into \r\nforce of the Rome Statute for Suriname and the Cook \r\nIslands on 1 October 2008, there are now 108 States \r\nparties to the Statute. That is an important step towards \r\nuniversality. The number of States Parties is rising year \r\nby year, and Norway strongly hopes that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court will enjoy universal \r\nadherence in the future. Furthermore, several States \r\nbecame signatories to the Agreement on the Privileges \r\nand Immunities of the International Criminal Court, \r\nbringing the total number of signatories to 63 States by \r\nthe end of the period under review. We urge more \r\nStates to follow suit. \r\n The International Criminal Court is dependent on \r\nthe cooperation of the States parties. As stressed in the \r\nreport, the Court relies on cooperation in areas such as \r\nfacilitating investigations, arresting and surrendering \r\npersons, protecting witnesses and enforcing sentences. \r\nAll States parties must do their utmost to provide the \r\nICC with the best possible working conditions. Norway \r\nexpects States with legal obligations under the Statute \r\nor that have entered into cooperation agreements with \r\nthe Court to fulfil their obligations and to demonstrate \r\ntheir commitment to justice in practice. We also urge \r\nmore States to enter into agreements with the Court. \r\n Finally, I would like to reiterate Norway’s firm \r\nand long-standing commitment to the integrity of the \r\nRome Statute and to an effective and credible \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We believe that the ICC \r\nshould enjoy the broadest possible support from all \r\nStates. We also believe that the long-term interests of \r\nall nations, irrespective of size, region or political \r\norientation, are served by strengthening the rule of law \r\nand promoting justice. We all share the universal \r\nvalues attached to the protection of human dignity. \r\nThat protection is enhanced by taking concerted action \r\nto suppress the most serious crimes affecting the \r\ninternational community as a whole. \r\n Mr. Appreku (Ghana): My delegation wishes to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his note accompanying \r\nhis submission of the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) (A/63/323) in accordance with \r\narticle 6 of the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the ICC. My delegation also takes \r\nnote of the Secretary-General’s report on expenses \r\nincurred and reimbursements received by the United \r\nNations in connection with assistance provided to the \r\nICC (A/63/471). My delegation also thanks the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court, Judge \r\nPhilippe Kirsch, for introducing the fourth report of the \r\nICC with his thought-provoking address. \r\n The adoption of the Rome Statute demonstrated \r\nthe commitment of the international community to \r\ndeterring and punishing impunity through the \r\nstrengthening of mechanisms for international justice. \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 18 \r\n \r\nThe Rome Statute, with its emphasis on individual \r\naccountability, serves in many respects to complement \r\nand reinforce the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\nhas State responsibility as its central focus. \r\n The Rome Statute contributes to ongoing efforts \r\nto resolve the prevailing tensions and often conflicting \r\ntendencies existing between the principle of  \r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of States and the \r\nundertaking by States Members of the United Nations \r\nto honour the obligations they assume under the \r\nCharter, including scrupulous respect for their \r\nobligation to respect human rights. Through the \r\nInternational Court of Justice’s South-West African \r\ncases and the various resolutions declaring apartheid to \r\nbe a crime against humanity, that tension seems to have \r\nbeen settled on the side of a presumption in favour of \r\nnot allowing States and individuals to claim that \r\nmatters are essentially within their domaine réservé as \r\nfar as cases of egregious violations of human rights are \r\nconcerned. \r\n The Rome Statute as properly understood aims at \r\nreinforcing that trend, thus ensuring that individuals \r\nwho commit acts of genocide, war crimes, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and ethnic cleansing cannot justify \r\nsuch heinous acts by abusing the concept of State \r\nsovereignty by invoking it as sword of impunity, and \r\nthen by turning around and trying to hide behind that \r\nsame State sovereignty by invoking it as a shield of \r\nimmunity. \r\n In keeping with that positive attitude, the African \r\nUnion actually took the lead in some respects by \r\nenshrining in its Constitutive Act the right of member \r\nStates to intervene in cases of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes. In Africa, we call that \r\nprinciple the doctrine of non-indifference, as opposed \r\nto non-interference. However, both the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect — on which African countries \r\nwere instrumental in achieving a consensus on having \r\nit be included in paragraphs 138 and 139 of the \r\n2005 Summit Outcome Document — and Africa’s \r\ndoctrine of non-indifference require further \r\nclarification to ensure certainty and predictability as to \r\nthe circumstances under which they could be engaged \r\nwith less controversy. To be sure, efforts to promote \r\nthe universality of the Rome Statute must be sustained \r\nif the authority and legitimacy of the International \r\nCriminal Court is to be enhanced. \r\n My delegation notes that cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the ICC continued at a satisfactory \r\npace during the period under review. Ghana welcomes \r\nthe entry into force on 3 March 2008 of the \r\nHeadquarters Agreement between the ICC and the host \r\nState, the Netherlands, which, as acknowledged in the \r\nICC’s report, has further enhanced cooperation and has \r\nfacilitated the Court’s smooth operations in The Hague, \r\nthus bringing more clarity and certainty to issues that \r\nwere not adequately covered by the interim \r\narrangements.  \r\n Ghana further welcomes the project concerning \r\nthe digitization of the entire legislative history of the \r\nRome Statute, which is funded by the Court and being \r\nundertaken by the secretariat of the Assembly of States \r\nParties and the Codification Division of the Office of \r\nLegal Affairs for the benefit of the Court itself, \r\npractitioners, academics and the general public. My \r\ndelegation looks forward to the possibility of having \r\nthat project linked to the audio-visual library project \r\nthat was launched by the Under-Secretary-General and \r\nthe Legal Counsel on Tuesday of this week, which \r\ntogether will strengthen the programmes for the wider \r\ndissemination of international law as a universal \r\nlanguage.  \r\n The role of various partners, including civil \r\nsociety organizations, is also commendable and must \r\nbe enriched through greater dialogue.  \r\n In his introductory address, the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Judge Philippe Kirsch, \r\nhighlighted a number of challenges facing the Court \r\nthat require our collective attention, including the need \r\nfor adequate resources, some of which will be \r\nconsidered during the forthcoming session of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties, in which Ghana looks \r\nforward to participating actively. It is also hoped that \r\nfactors leading to the slow response to requests for the \r\nconclusion of agreements for the enforcement of \r\nsentences, as well as ways to improve witness \r\nprotection programmes, will be addressed among other \r\noutstanding and pending issues. \r\n My delegation notes that the ICC has not yet \r\ncompleted the full cycle from the trial phase to appeal \r\nin any of the cases currently before it. It is our \r\nexpectation that, by the time the Review Conference \r\ntakes place in 2010, a sufficient corpus of \r\njurisprudence will have been developed to facilitate a \r\nmore meaningful review of the Rome Statute. \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n19 08-58347 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to commend \r\nthe work of the liaison offices of the ICC, as well as \r\nthe working groups in New York and The Hague. \r\nGhana would like to reaffirm its commitment to the \r\nRome Statute, aimed at strengthening the rule of law. \r\n In closing, Ghana wishes to express profound \r\nappreciation to Judge Philippe Kirsch for his \r\npioneering role in the establishment of the ICC as a \r\nnovel mechanism. The greatest tribute that we can pay \r\nto him — as we hear that he will retire next year — is \r\nto rededicate ourselves to ensuring that this unique \r\ninstitution for the promotion of international criminal \r\njustice can stand the test of time and become an \r\nenduring legacy.  \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): Let me begin by thanking \r\nPresident Philippe Kirsch for his insightful report (see \r\nA/63/323) on the most recent work of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) and by congratulating the Court \r\non its increasingly important role in the fight against \r\nimpunity in the international community. \r\n Japan believes that we are now experiencing a \r\ncrucial period for the ICC to define its role in the \r\ninternational community. In 2002, the ICC was \r\nestablished as the first permanent international criminal \r\ncourt. In contrast to the procedure for ad hoc \r\ninternational criminal tribunals, any State party may \r\nrefer a situation to the Court, and the Security Council \r\nalso has the authority to refer a situation to it. In the six \r\nyears since the Court’s establishment, three States \r\nparties have referred their situations to the ICC and one \r\nsituation has been referred by the Council. \r\n On the basis of our relatively brief experience, \r\nwe have been able to strongly reaffirm the importance \r\nof cooperation by States. In cases in which full \r\ncooperation has been extended by the States concerned, \r\nthe ICC is making steady progress. Where such \r\ncooperation is not available, the ICC is faced with \r\nserious challenges. \r\n Ten years have passed since the adoption of the \r\nRome Statute, but we must not forget the difficulties \r\nthat we encountered during the negotiations for its \r\ncreation. Although we finally came to agreement on the \r\ntext and the Statute entered into force in 2002, unless \r\nits provisions are implemented with the utmost \r\nprudence, we will not succeed in firmly establishing \r\nthe credibility and reputation of the ICC.  \r\n One of the most important principles to be kept in \r\nmind is that of complementarity. Every State has the \r\nduty to exercise criminal jurisdiction over those \r\nresponsible for the most serious crimes, and the role of \r\nthe ICC is complementary to such national criminal \r\njurisdictions. States parties must do their best to \r\nexercise their national jurisdiction before referring a \r\nsituation to the ICC. Moreover, in referring a situation, \r\na State party must be prepared to cooperate fully with \r\nthe ICC by fulfilling the obligations set out in the \r\nRome Statute. \r\n The Security Council also may refer a situation to \r\nthe ICC. However, the decision to bring a situation \r\nbefore the Court entails heavy responsibility, and the \r\nCouncil must continue to cooperate closely with the \r\nICC on the implementation of its decision. If the \r\nSecurity Council makes the decision to refer a situation \r\nto the ICC, in accordance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, States Members of the United Nations \r\nare legally bound by the Council’s decision. They are \r\nrequired to cooperate fully with the ICC in its \r\ninvestigation and prosecution. The ICC, for its part, \r\nmust provide a full explanation of its actions so that it \r\ncan enjoy the full support of United Nations Member \r\nStates.  \r\n Today, there are 108 States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute. Japan is pleased to observe the steady increase \r\nin that number. Nevertheless, in order to enhance the \r\nrole of the ICC in the international community, the \r\nCourt’s membership must become more universal. To \r\nthat end, it is essential that more States become parties \r\nto the Rome Statute. Japan will play its role in efforts \r\nto increase the number of States parties, especially in \r\nthe Asian Group, which is less well represented than \r\nother regions. \r\n It is Japan’s hope that the ICC will continue to \r\nwork diligently to eradicate the culture of impunity and \r\nto consolidate its reputation. In that regard, Japan is \r\ndetermined to continue and strengthen its contribution \r\nto the ICC and to the development of the international \r\ncriminal tribunal system as a whole. \r\n Mr. Ahmed (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation \r\nthanks the Secretary-General for the report on the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for the judicial year \r\n2007-2008 (see A/63/323), submitted to the General \r\nAssembly in accordance with article 6 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the Court. My delegation also thanks Judge \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 20 \r\n \r\nPhilippe Kirsch, President of the ICC, for the clarity of \r\nhis address. We are appreciative of the Court’s \r\nrelentless efforts in carrying out its mandate as an \r\nindependent judicial institution charged with \r\ninvestigations into and trials of individuals for the most \r\nserious crimes of international concern — genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes. \r\n Nigeria is deeply committed to the ICC, whose \r\nestablishment we recognize as one of the great \r\nadvances in the area of international law. The Court’s \r\nfunction of ensuring accountability for grave crimes is \r\nvital to the maintenance of lasting international peace \r\nand security. In order to strengthen its ability to \r\neffectively discharge that most important \r\nresponsibility, the Court relies on the cooperation of \r\nStates, international organizations and civil society, in \r\naccordance with the Rome Statute and international \r\nagreements concluded by the Court. Such cooperation \r\nis critical to ensuring proper investigations, the \r\nexecution of outstanding warrants of arrest, the \r\nsurrender of persons, the protection of witnesses, the \r\nenforcement of sentences and the enhancement of the \r\nCourt’s credibility as an effective tool to end impunity \r\nand contribute to the prevention of future crimes. \r\n We welcome the increasing number of States that \r\nhave become States parties to the ICC treaty. With \r\nmore than two thirds of the United Nations \r\nmembership having signed or ratified the treaty, there \r\nis clear movement towards the Court’s universality. \r\nThis welcome development is worthy of further \r\nsupport by those States who have yet to sign or ratify \r\nthe Rome Statute. \r\n We have taken note of efforts by the ICC to \r\nimprove geographical representation, gender balance \r\nand the representation of the different legal systems of \r\nthe world in its recruitment activities in accordance \r\nwith resolution ICC-ASP/1/Res.10 of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties. As we commend those efforts, we wish \r\nto underscore the need for the ICC to achieve the target \r\nof wide geographical representation and gender \r\nbalance, especially in regard to the African region, \r\nwhich, in spite of the fact that it provides most, if not \r\nall of the situations before the Court, is still \r\nunderrepresented. We believe that the necessary \r\nbalance can be attained without compromising the \r\nquality of staff selected. \r\n The Nigerian delegation considers victims as a \r\ncritical component of the justice system and believes \r\nthat for them to have the necessary closure, efforts \r\nmust be made to bring about healing. We are therefore \r\ndelighted that the Court has so far received \r\napplications from 960 victims for participation in the \r\ntrials and that 168 of them are already so participating. \r\n The ICC currently has four situations — Uganda; \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo; Darfur; The \r\nSudan; and the Central African Republic — and six \r\ncases before it. twelve arrest warrants have been \r\nissued, with seven of them still pending. With the \r\nexpected increase in the number of cases in 2009, \r\nadditional funding will be needed. We therefore call on \r\nall States to disburse their outstanding contributions to \r\nthe Court to enable it attain its 2009 budget of \r\n€105.1 million. \r\n We are pleased to note that the Court has already \r\nentered into 10 agreements with States on the \r\nprotection and relocation of witnesses and \r\n2 agreements with States on the enforcement of \r\nsentences. We believe that, in order to encourage more \r\nStates to enter into such agreements with the Court, the \r\nCourt needs to become more proactive in exploring \r\nways to facilitate the participation of more developing \r\nStates in that regard. \r\n The Nigerian delegation realizes that family visits \r\nto accused persons involve costs, especially since \r\ncourts are located far away from the normal places of \r\nresidence of family members. Although family visits \r\nmay not be considered a fundamental right, refusal of \r\nsuch visits could nonetheless demoralize both family \r\nmembers and the accused themselves. We understand \r\nthat the issue will be discussed during the seventh \r\nsession of the Assembly of States Parties, to be held at \r\nThe Hague in November. We hope that due \r\nconsideration will be given to all aspects of that \r\nimportant matter before arriving at a decision. \r\n The situation in the Darfur region of the Sudan \r\nhas aroused a great deal of interest in the international \r\ncommunity, especially since the ICC Prosecutor’s \r\ninitial report to the Security Council (see S/PV.5216). \r\nSince then, there has also been a request for deferral \r\nduly brought under article 16 of the Rome Statute of \r\nthe ICC. We believe that the request — which is a \r\nlegally backed process and which does not imply a \r\nconflict between peace and justice — should be \r\nallowed to run its course. We are also confident that the \r\ninternational community will not allow a politicization \r\nof the process. \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n21 08-58347 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, the Nigerian delegation reiterates \r\nits commitment to and continued support for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. \r\n Mr. Muita (Kenya): My delegation believes that \r\nthe establishment of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) is an enormously significant advancement in \r\ninternational law. We recognize the Court’s unique \r\njudicial role and, in particular, the important part it is \r\nplaying in our efforts to put an end to impunity through \r\nthe prevention of the most serious international crimes \r\nand guaranteeing lasting respect for the rule of law. \r\nImpunity not only encourages the recurrence of abuses, \r\nbut also strips human rights law and humanitarian law \r\nof their deterrent effect. Therefore, the Court provides \r\nan enforcement mechanism to prevent that. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm \r\nKenya’s commitment to its obligations under the Rome \r\nStatute. We appreciate the ongoing cooperation and \r\nconsultation between the ICC and the Office of the \r\nKenya Attorney-General on a broad range of issues. \r\nThis attests to the recognition and support that my \r\ncountry gives the Court. \r\n My delegation pays tribute to Judge Philippe \r\nKirsch, President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nand his team for their excellent stewardship of the \r\naffairs of the Court. Judge Kirsch’s unquestioned \r\ncommitment to justice has contributed to the \r\ndevelopment and success of the Court to date. As he \r\napproaches the end of his term, we wish him all the \r\nvery best. \r\n Kenya welcomes the report of the ICC for the \r\nperiod 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008 (see A/63/323). \r\nIt provides us with a very useful framework for \r\nevaluating the successes and challenges faced by the \r\nCourt. As we have seen, implementing the Rome \r\nStatute is challenging. My delegation believes the \r\nsuccess of the ICC hinges on the collective cooperation \r\nof Member States, the United Nations and the Security \r\nCouncil. In particular, the success of the Court depends \r\non widespread ratification of its Statute, given that it is \r\ntreaty-based and largely depends on the compliance of \r\nStates parties with their obligations under the law. \r\n We are very encouraged that the number of States \r\nparties increased during the reporting period from 105 \r\nto 108. This is testimony to the growing acceptance of \r\nthe universality of the Statute. More recently, the \r\nratification and accession by Madagascar, the Cook \r\nIslands and Suriname was most welcome. \r\n The increasing number of States parties to the \r\nRome Statute and to the Agreement on Privileges and \r\nImmunities is testimony to the global judicial character \r\nof the Court. In that respect, Kenya congratulates \r\nMexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the United \r\nKingdom on becoming parties or signatories to the \r\nAgreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Court. \r\nWe urge the States that have not done so to consider \r\nbecoming parties to the ICC Statute. \r\n My delegation is concerned that the definition of \r\nthe crime of aggression is still pending. Similarly, the \r\nfact that the Court has not conducted a full cycle of \r\nproceedings since its inception is worrying. That state \r\nof affairs will have an impact on the first review of the \r\nStatute of the Court. However, Kenya believes the \r\nchallenges are not insurmountable if States \r\ndemonstrate a willingness, inter alia, to cooperate. That \r\nis especially true considering that the Rome Statute \r\naffords us the opportunity to deal with serious crimes \r\nagainst humanity under domestic law before the ICC \r\ncan assume jurisdiction. We are convinced that the \r\nprinciple of complementarity is a positive aspect that \r\ncan help us build upon our quest to promote and \r\nprotect human rights. \r\n I am pleased to report that Kenya is on course in \r\nits endeavour to implement internal mechanisms to \r\nexpedite domestication of the Rome Treaty. In \r\nrecognition of our responsibilities with regard to the \r\nrule of law and, in particular, the Rome Statute, the \r\nGovernment enacted the Witness Protection Act on 31 \r\nOctober 2006 and has now commenced a witness \r\nprotection programme, which was launched at the \r\nUnited Nations Office in Nairobi on 1 July 2008. The \r\nlaunch of that programme is a landmark in our \r\ndomestic criminal justice system. We believe that the \r\nincorporation of a financial allocation into the national \r\nbudget for the 2008-2009 fiscal year will give impetus \r\nto our efforts. \r\n Kenya fully supports the inter-Court seminars and \r\ndiplomatic briefings held under the auspices of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and the International \r\nCourt of Justice, among other international judicial \r\nbodies. Those seminars and briefings will certainly \r\npromote awareness about the activities of the Court. \r\nWe also appreciate the Court’s outreach programme \r\nand the progress achieved through it. Such activities \r\nare crucial to our strategy to promote and enhance the \r\ndialogue needed to realize the plan of action for the \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 22 \r\n \r\nachievement of the universality and full \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute. \r\n My delegation is gratified by the strengthened \r\nand enhanced cooperation between the Court and the \r\nUnited Nations, in line with the Relationship \r\nAgreement. That cooperation is instrumental to the \r\nsuccess of the activities of the Court and should be \r\nsustained. We commend the role being carried out by \r\nthe Court’s liaison office in New York. We propose the \r\nestablishment of a similar framework for the \r\ndeveloping world, especially Africa. \r\n The completion of the first phase of the \r\ndigitalization of the entire legislative history of the \r\nRome process by the Assembly of States Parties and \r\nthe Codification Division of the Office of Legal \r\nAffairs, funded by the Court, is a milestone in the \r\neffort to disseminate information about the Court. This \r\nresource will be of invaluable use to the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Given that the operations of the International \r\nCriminal Court are in harmony with the principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nCourt’s work contributes to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. For that reason, my \r\ndelegation appeals to States to uphold the model law \r\nthat they have helped to establish. The commitment of \r\nStates and all other relevant actors should transcend \r\npolitical considerations in order to help preserve the \r\nCourt’s independence and integrity. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): I should \r\nlike at the outset to express my heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Philippe Kirsch, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, on the quality of the \r\nwork that he has accomplished at the helm of that \r\ninstitution and on the detailed information contained in \r\nhis statement. I also congratulate his fellow judges and \r\nthe other personnel of that institution. \r\n As members are already aware, Senegal was the \r\nfirst country to ratify the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. In addition, one hardly \r\nneed recall that my country was among the first to sign \r\nthe international appeal for the establishment of an \r\ninternational criminal court. For those reasons, I once \r\nagain welcome the opportunity provided by the review \r\nof the annual report of the Court (see A/63/323) to \r\nreaffirm Senegal’s interest in that institution’s \r\nactivities.  \r\n Of course, it is difficult to precisely gauge the \r\nreal impact of the International Criminal Court a few \r\nyears after it commenced its work. However, Members \r\nwill certainly agree with me that, in the light of the \r\nCourt’s report, one can say without risk of being wrong \r\nthat the Court has revived the glimmer of hope that its \r\nestablishment gave to victims whose hopes and \r\nexpectations for justice were so constantly \r\ndisappointed. Today, after several years of tireless \r\nefforts and struggles, we have put in place the \r\ninstrument so eagerly awaited by all women and men \r\nof goodwill, who have arduously devoted themselves \r\nto ending the horrors and atrocities that have shaken \r\nand shattered all humankind.  \r\n Obviously, the advent of the International \r\nCriminal Court is one of the most valuable \r\nachievements of our time in combating the impunity of \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes. Indeed, with its \r\nestablishment, the Court has contributed, through its \r\ndeterrent effect on potential perpetrators of serious \r\ncrimes, to a decline in the number of atrocities \r\nthroughout the world that were so common, \r\nparticularly during the twentieth century.  \r\n Moreover, six years after it began its work on \r\n1 July 2002, we can boast of having established a \r\npermanent Court with a universal mission — a Court \r\nthat is fully operational, with ongoing investigations \r\nand judicial proceedings in four situations, and that has \r\nbeen acceded to by 108 States parties and enjoys the \r\nactive support of more than 2,500 non-governmental \r\norganizations and civil society. We have also been able \r\nto establish a system in which victims participate in \r\nproceedings and benefit from protection and assistance.  \r\n In short, as so well stated by the Prosecutor of the \r\nCourt, Mr. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, in November \r\n2003 during the oath-taking ceremony for the Deputy \r\nProsecutor, Mr. Serge Brammertz,  \r\n “The creation of the International Criminal Court \r\nrepresents, for the international community, a \r\nstep comparable to the evolution of over \r\n10 centuries of national criminal justice systems”.  \r\n However, the very significant progress made \r\nduring the life of our young institution should clearly \r\nnot prevent us from fully understanding the complexity \r\nand scale of the enormous challenges that we must face \r\nin order to complete our joint effort to build an \r\ninternational justice system that can fulfil the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of peoples to peace and justice. \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n23 08-58347 \r\n \r\nThat is why we must never lose sight of the principles \r\nthat guided the drafting of the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court: the need for an \r\ninternational, independent, non-political and \r\nrepresentative Court that can work efficiently and \r\neffectively to bring to justice those responsible for the \r\nmost serious crimes; the right of States to shoulder the \r\nresponsibility for prosecuting such crimes, if they are \r\nwilling and able to do so; the need to guarantee \r\nreparation and adequate compensation to the victims of \r\nsuch crimes; and the need to protect the rights of \r\naccused persons and the role of the Security Council in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThose principles must always guide the Court if we \r\nwish to fully succeed, without any legal tricks or \r\ndevices, in making it an effective, transparent and non-\r\nselective institution.  \r\n In reaffirming our commitment to and unfailing \r\nsupport for the International Criminal Court, as well as \r\nour commitment to do our utmost to ensure that it has \r\nthe independence and credibility necessary to eradicate \r\nimpunity throughout the world, I should like to \r\nconclude by solemnly appealing to the entire \r\ninternational community to provide the Court with the \r\ncooperation and support it needs to carry out its noble \r\nmissions.  \r\n Mr. Hernández (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Mexico would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court, Judge \r\nPhilippe Kirsch, for his presentation of the Court’s \r\nfourth annual report (see A/63/323), pursuant to the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the Court. I would like to pay tribute to that jurist, \r\ndiplomat and magistrate for all his effort, first in \r\nachieving the adoption of the Rome Statute and, \r\nsecondly, in making the Court fully operational. The \r\ninternational community is indebted to Judge Kirsch. \r\n The report’s delivery comes on a special \r\noccasion, as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute, which established \r\nthe International Criminal Court. Mexico celebrates the \r\nfirst decade of existence of an international court \r\nwhose fundamental challenge is to meet the desire \r\ncherished by the international community since the \r\nbeginning of the last century: to put an end to impunity \r\nfor the gravest crimes of concern to all of humankind. \r\nTen years following the adoption of the Rome Statute, \r\nits universalization remains both a shared aspiration \r\nand a task to be pursued jointly, in the interest of \r\nachieving the objectives of international criminal \r\njustice, as enshrined in the Statute itself. The \r\nGovernment of Mexico congratulates Madagascar on \r\nits ratification of the Rome Statute and congratulates \r\nSuriname and the Cook Islands on their accession to \r\nthe Rome Statute during this year, bringing the number \r\nof States parties to 108.  \r\n Mexico enthusiastically welcomes the \r\nachievements made in the four and a half years since \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction came into effect, without losing \r\nsight of the difficulties and challenges that have arisen \r\nin the fulfilment of its mandate. As my delegation has \r\npreviously stated, both the goal and the challenge of \r\nthe Court lie in its becoming a model of expeditious, \r\neffective and transparent justice. In this context, I \r\nwould like to convey a number of considerations on \r\nbehalf of my Government on this judicial body’s work. \r\n I turn first to expeditious and effective justice. \r\nTen years ago, the plenipotentiary representatives of \r\nthe United Nations gathered in Rome to provide the \r\nStatute with the necessary minimum tools and \r\nmechanisms to fulfil the principle of effective and \r\nexpeditious justice. To that end, the Rome Statute was \r\nequipped with clear and precise Rules of Procedure to \r\nsafeguard the rights and interests of the parties \r\nconcerned in specific cases. Mexico underscores the \r\neffectiveness of those tools and mechanisms and deems \r\nthe Rules of Procedure adequate to guarantee full \r\nrespect for the rights of the accused, victims and other \r\nactors. Their application at the various stages of \r\nproceedings and the gradual consolidation of the \r\nCourt’s jurisprudence will ensure that the expectations \r\nof a model of agile and effective justice are satisfied.  \r\n Despite these promising signs, Mexico expresses \r\nits concern that, more than two and a half years after \r\nthe surrender of the first accused to the Court, it has \r\nstill not been possible to begin its first trial. My \r\nGovernment is fully aware of the challenges that arise \r\nin initiating intrinsically complex judicial proceedings \r\nand acknowledges that the creation of the Court’s own \r\njurisprudence is, by definition, a difficult task. Mexico \r\nfurther recognizes that a lack of cooperation, which I \r\nwill address later, has been one of the main \r\ncomplicating factors in all areas of the Court’s work. \r\nEven in this context, the early removal of possible \r\nprocedural obstacles is fundamental to allowing the \r\nCourt to exercise its jurisdiction effectively and \r\nefficiently, especially when alleged perpetrators are in \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 24 \r\n \r\nthe custody of the Court. It is fundamentally important \r\nto ensure proper preparation of cases, both throughout \r\nthe investigation phase and in the manner of obtaining \r\nand presenting evidence.  \r\n The Court should begin its first trial primarily to \r\nbring justice to victims, but also to move forward in \r\nbuilding its jurisprudence. It is up to States to fulfil all \r\ntheir obligations without delay, and it is up to the Court \r\nto prepare and handle cases in the most diligent fashion \r\npossible at every stage, in order to avoid any situation \r\nthat could encumber its progress and to guarantee full \r\nrespect for the rights of the accused. \r\n Regarding international cooperation, it was clear \r\n10 years ago that one of the fundamental premises for \r\nthe International Criminal Court to fulfil its mandate \r\nwas the full cooperation of States parties in the \r\ninvestigation and prosecution of crimes under the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction. This fundamental pillar was \r\nembodied in article 9 of the Statute. Given the very \r\nnature of the investigations carried out by the Court, it \r\nis unquestionable that the Court must be able to rely on \r\nthe firm and immediate support of those States in \r\nwhich investigations are taking place: the situation \r\ncountries. Moreover, the complexity of the Court’s \r\nwork also obliges the rest of the international \r\ncommunity, including international and regional \r\norganizations, to cooperate fully with the Court. In this \r\nregard, it is essential that States respond rapidly to the \r\nCourt’s requests for cooperation and, above all, that \r\nthey execute its orders, particularly arrest warrants \r\nissued against presumed perpetrators.  \r\n Mexico recognizes with satisfaction that, in \r\nseveral instances, the level of cooperation has been \r\nexcellent; proof of this is the detention and surrender to \r\nthe Court of Mr. Thomas Lubanga, Mr. Germain \r\nKatanga and Mr. Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui by the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the \r\nrecent detention and surrender of Mr. Jean-Pierre \r\nBemba Gombo by Belgium. My Government wishes to \r\nextend its deep appreciation to those States for their \r\nactions. \r\n Similarly, the cooperation and assistance for the \r\nCourt’s activities extended by various bodies and \r\noffices of the United Nations, as outlined in the report, \r\ndeserve acknowledgment. In spite of this progress, \r\nthere is still considerable distance to go before the full \r\ncooperation required by the Statute is achieved. Seven \r\nof the arrest orders issued to date have not yet been \r\nexecuted, and a number of the investigations being \r\ncarried out by the Prosecutor’s Office in situation \r\nStates are constantly hindered by a lack of assistance \r\nfrom local authorities. The international community is \r\nconcerned at the lack of cooperation from the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan, with regard to both the \r\ninvestigations taking place on its territory and the \r\narrest and surrender of suspects of crimes within the \r\njurisdiction of the Court.  \r\n International and non-governmental organizations \r\ncontinue to report the existence of generalized attacks \r\nagainst the civilian population in the Sudan. As of \r\ntoday, there have been over 200,000 civilian casualties \r\nand nearly 2 million displaced persons from the region \r\nsince the outbreak of the conflict.  \r\n It is equally indispensable that we enhance \r\nsecurity for the international humanitarian personnel \r\ndeployed by the United Nations, who have been the \r\ntarget of attacks. In the case of the United Nations \r\nMission in the Sudan the lack of security has resulted \r\nin the death of 38 people. Given these numbers, the \r\nexistence of a peace process in the region is not \r\nsufficiently clear. \r\n Mexico is convinced that peace and justice are \r\ninseparable components of any endeavour to end any \r\narmed conflict. A false dichotomy between peace and \r\njustice only damages the performance of the \r\ninstitutions created to preserve international peace and \r\njustice. While these institutions may have different \r\nmandates, their role is to complement and reinforce \r\none another. Their role is to ensure that political \r\nprocesses include the elements needed to ensure that \r\nthere is no room for impunity. The rendering of justice \r\nstrengthens the search for lasting and peaceful \r\nsolutions. \r\n The international community cannot ignore the \r\ngravity of such situations. On the contrary, it should \r\nstrengthen its efforts to act on the basis of a model of \r\njustice that values the end to impunity more than a \r\npolitical agreement. \r\n With respect to financial efficiency, ten years ago \r\nthe International Criminal Court was conceived as a \r\nmodel international institution in terms of financial \r\nmanagement and administration. The complex and \r\ndiverse activities assigned to the Court naturally \r\nrequired a large budget to enable it and its different \r\norgans to carry out their respective duties. It has been \r\n \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n25 08-58347 \r\n \r\nthe Court’s responsibility and challenge to find ways to \r\nachieve a proper, diligent and transparent \r\nadministration using the resources granted to it.  \r\n Mexico has closely followed the Court’s financial \r\ndevelopment and acknowledges the efforts made and \r\nmeasures taken to use its resources responsibly and \r\nefficiently. Nevertheless, there is room for \r\nimprovement in every financial model. My \r\nGovernment is of the view that there are certain areas \r\nthat can be fine-tuned to render the Court more fully \r\ncost-effective and at the same time ensure that it be \r\nable to fulfil its mandate.  \r\n Adequate and comprehensive budgetary planning, \r\nbetter financial practices in certain areas and the proper \r\nrationalization of resources are fundamental to \r\nachieving this goal, particularly in times such as these, \r\ntimes of general financial crisis. Therefore, Mexico \r\nwill participate actively in the upcoming examination \r\nof the Court’s budget by the Assembly of States parties \r\nand invites all other States to act accordingly. \r\n Ten years ago, 160 States successfully overcame \r\nserious difficulties and differences in pursuit of a \r\ncommon cause that finally materialized in the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute and the creation of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Today, 108 States have \r\nconfirmed their commitment to that same cause. \r\nMexico is convinced that they will not waver until \r\njustice prevails and all persons responsible for \r\ncommitting the most heinous crimes are held \r\naccountable before the International Criminal Court. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nhave examined with regret the content of the report \r\npresented to the General Assembly on the activities of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), including in \r\nthe Sudan (see A/63/323). It is a document full of \r\nexasperating political deceit that is directed at the \r\nPresident of our Republic himself, the symbol of our \r\ndignity and of our nationhood. The author of the report \r\nis an international prosecutor who has acted \r\nunprofessionally and is motivated by a political agenda \r\nthat has now been unmasked by his fervent hysterical \r\npolitical actions, which are not those of a respectable \r\nman of justice and undermine both justice and his \r\nposition.  \r\n The catastrophic actions of the Prosecutor of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court has led him to issue an \r\narrest warrant for the President of our Republic, which \r\nis but one additional link in the conspiracy chain that \r\nmakes up his shameful political agenda. This action \r\nhas led to outrage and criticism from all regional \r\norganizations, which have asked him to correct the \r\nsituation in order to ensure peace and security in the \r\nSudan. \r\n The Sudan is not a party to the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich set up the International Criminal Court. This is \r\nSudan’s sovereign right, which stems from the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law and from \r\nthe 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, \r\nwhich clearly stipulates that the pacta sunt servanda \r\nprinciple is an important one and that Member States \r\nare not bound by commitments that they have not taken \r\nof their own free will. The attempt therefore to impose \r\na convention on a State that is not a member of that \r\nconvention undermines all norms and established rules \r\nof international law.  \r\n The ICC should not be a tool in the hands of \r\npolitical organs, since that would undermine its \r\ncredibility and impartiality. Security Council resolution \r\n1422 (2002), adopted following the entry into force of \r\nthe Rome Statute, states that States that are not party to \r\nthe Rome Statute and therefore not members of the \r\nICC are not bound by the provisions of the Rome \r\nStatute. They will continue to fulfil their \r\nresponsibilities in their national jurisdictions. That is \r\nwhat the Sudan is doing, thanks to its competent court \r\nsystem, which is known for its efficiency.  \r\n Resolution 1593 (2005), which referred the \r\nsituation in Darfur to the Prosecutor of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, is a faulty resolution and \r\ncontradicts resolution 1422 (2002), which deals with \r\nthe obligations of States parties and States not party to \r\nthe Rome Statute. In addition, resolution 1593 (2005) \r\nclearly recognizes that States not party to the Rome \r\nStatute have no obligation under the Statute. Is that the \r\nthrust and universality of the justice that he preaches \r\nand seeks? This is the justice of might makes right. Is it \r\nright that this report should remain silent about \r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity that \r\nare committed on a daily basis throughout the Middle \r\nEast and Asia? The report resorts to holding the Sudan \r\nhostage. If the pretext is based on the policy that \r\nMember States must submit to the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt, why then are those States that are in a state of \r\nwar in regions such as the Middle East and Asia not \r\nthemselves dealt with by the Court?  \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 26 \r\n \r\n That is a selective approach based on a system of \r\ndouble standards. That is why the African Union \r\nSummit, convened in July 2008 at Sharm el-Sheikh in \r\nEgypt, adopted a historic and important decision, in \r\nwhich the African Union expressed its concerns and \r\ndenounced what is known as universal jurisdiction. All \r\nday today we heard nothing but the names of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and the \r\nCentral African Republic, but we have not heard \r\nanything about Iraq or Afghanistan — only about the \r\nSudan, Darfur, the Central African Republic and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.  \r\n The Rome Statute, which established the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, stipulates that its \r\nprovisions shall not run counter to established norms of \r\ninternational law. In that regard, the actions of the \r\nProsecutor are incompatible with the Rome Statute, for \r\nhe has disregarded well-established immunities under \r\ninternational law in respect of the President of a State, \r\na case that was dealt with by the International Court of \r\nJustice. The violation of immunities undermines the \r\nprinciples of sovereignty and leads to chaos, which \r\nshould not be allowed by the international community. \r\nPeace in the Sudan is the best guarantee of \r\ninternational justice. Justice is not achieved by merely \r\nturning to a court.  \r\n The experience in South Africa is itself proof of \r\nthe primacy of law, which is an integral part of the road \r\nmap involving the Sudan, the African Union and the \r\nUnited Nations, which is based on four tracks. The four \r\ncomponents of the peace process are the hybrid \r\npeacekeeping operation, the humanitarian tier, \r\nrehabilitation and development. The actions of the \r\nProsecutor do not comply with that road map, but open \r\nthe door wide to situations fraught with danger with \r\nregard to the security of the Sudan and the region as a \r\nwhole.  \r\n We are confident that the international \r\ncommunity supports the peace efforts brought about by \r\nthe Sudan’s People’s Initiative, in close cooperation \r\nand coordination with the chief negotiator, Djibril \r\nBassolé, in accord with the African-Arab initiative \r\nunder the presidency of Qatar. The Sudan reiterates its \r\ncommitment to comply with all of its obligations with \r\nregard to the African Union and the United Nations. \r\nThe international community must protect the peace \r\nprocess against any political schemes. The slogan of \r\njustice should not be used as a pretext to exert pressure \r\nand to blackmail States. Throughout the day, we have \r\nheard nothing but references to Darfur, the Congo and \r\nthe Central African Republic.  \r\n Ms. Cabello de Daboin (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of my \r\nGovernment, I would like to convey the support of the \r\ndelegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for \r\nthe leadership shown by Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann and to offer him the cooperation necessary \r\nfor the success of this and future meetings on such \r\nimportant issues as international peace, security and \r\njustice, which are the guarantees of the well-being of \r\nhumankind. \r\n Similarly, we would like to thank Judge Philippe \r\nKirsch, President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), for his introduction of the report of the Court \r\n(see A/63/323) and to commend him on the results \r\nachieved by the ICC in the past year. \r\n From the first discussions on drafting the text of \r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, \r\nmy country played an active and resolute role in \r\nestablishing the ICC, based on the premise that the \r\nmost serious crimes, which constitute a threat to the \r\ninternational community, must not go unpunished. \r\n In that regard, it is necessary to underscore the \r\nimportance for States to adopt national measures, \r\naimed at strengthening international cooperation, thus \r\nensuring that those crimes are in fact brought to \r\njustice. \r\n It is fitting to recall that my country was the first \r\nin Latin America to ratify the Rome Statute and has \r\nalways upheld the integrity of that instrument against \r\nsteps taken to undermine it, not only through the \r\nrejection of the special immunity agreements \r\nestablished or at times imposed on other countries, but \r\nalso through the condemnation of the many resolutions \r\nthat have sought to distort the independence of the \r\nCourt and undermine the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to achieve universal criminal jurisdiction. \r\n My delegation would like to emphasize that the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela has placed particular \r\nemphasis on preserving the independence and \r\nautonomy of the ICC and of its Statute in the ongoing \r\nnegotiations to define the crime of aggression. Our \r\nactions have included submitting a proposal aimed at \r\nsafeguarding to the utmost the independence of the \r\nCourt when it is to handle a case involving the alleged \r\ncommission of a crime of aggression, thus firmly \r\n A/63/PV.35\r\n \r\n27 08-58347 \r\n \r\nopposing those who seek to subordinate the \r\nproceedings of that international organ of justice to the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Our delegation believes that the competencies of \r\nthe Security Council and the ICC are well defined and \r\nmust not give rise to false dilemmas with regard to \r\nsteps to be taken against crimes already classified or \r\nwith respect to the crime of aggression, which we shall \r\ndefine in the near future, because that crime must be \r\nrepudiated and condemned in all its forms. \r\n We would like to use this occasion to call on \r\nthose States that have not yet done so to accede to the \r\nRome Statute, on the premise that the Court should be \r\nestablished as the supreme authority to end impunity \r\nand to try the perpetrators of the most serious crimes \r\nthat affect the international community as a whole, be \r\nit genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanitarian or \r\nacts of aggression. \r\n The legal order is responsible for establishing and \r\nmaintaining peace, an unconditional and absolute \r\npeace where each human being can exercise his or her \r\nfreedom under the rule of law. A truly democratic State \r\nbased on the rule of law is founded on truth, fairness \r\nand social justice. \r\n In conclusion, we must point out that the search \r\nfor truth is not in conflict with achieving justice. Truth \r\nis devalued when it is not associated with justice, and \r\nthe application of justice without the understanding \r\nthat truth imparts engenders the worst iniquities. In \r\nturn, peace and justice are inseparable. We cannot and \r\nmust not sacrifice one for the other. Justice is crucial \r\nfor the development of societies, including an \r\ninternational society. \r\n Mr. Butagira (Uganda): My delegation is very \r\npleased that Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann is chairing our \r\nmeetings, and we pledge our full commitment to work \r\nwith him and his Bureau.  \r\n We also take this opportunity to thank Judge \r\nPhilippe Kirsch, President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, for the detailed and informative report (see \r\nA/63/323). We shall endeavour to elucidate some of the \r\npoints raised in the report, placing special emphasis on \r\nthose pertaining to Uganda. \r\n We welcome the report, especially those parts \r\nthat recognize the efforts made by the Government of \r\nUganda to cooperate with the Court with a view to \r\nexecuting the arrest warrants. As recently as June 2008, \r\nregional Governments met in Kampala and agreed on \r\njoint operations against the notorious Lord’s Resistance \r\nArmy. We call on those States that have the means to \r\nreinforce those efforts to end that affront to the resolve \r\nof the international community to bring to justice the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes. One way \r\nwould be to revise the mandate of the United Nations \r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, to make it robust so as to include the \r\napprehension of the leadership of the Lord’s Resistance \r\nArmy. Unless the culprits are brought to justice, the \r\nLord’s Resistance Army will continue to cause \r\nmayhem in the region, as it is currently doing. \r\n The Lord’s Resistance Army is a cancer that \r\nneeds to be eradicated urgently before it can spread any \r\nfurther. It is common knowledge that it started its \r\nheinous criminality in northern Uganda. Our forces \r\nfought it and flushed it out of Uganda. Uganda had \r\nwarned right from the beginning that unless there was \r\ncooperation from the international community, the \r\nsituation could turn into a regional disaster with far-\r\nreaching implications. Unfortunately that warning was \r\nnot heeded. As we speak, the Lord’s Resistance Army \r\nis abducting children in eastern Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, in the Sudan and in the Central African \r\nRepublic, and it has reinforced its forces by the \r\nhundreds by adding the kidnapped children to their \r\nnumber. For the sake of those and other victims, we \r\nonce again appeal for concrete action. \r\n We fail to understand the reluctance of those with \r\nthe means to assist in getting rid of this ugly spot from \r\nour midst. What started as a northern Uganda problem \r\nhas slowly but predictably sucked in other surrounding \r\nStates until it has gained the notoriety of a regional \r\ndisaster. \r\n Therefore, for the sake of the victims — the \r\nabducted children, those who have been forced into sex \r\nslavery — and for the sake of the hundreds of children \r\nwho are forced to kill members of their families so as \r\nto initiate them into that heinous organization, we call \r\nfor cooperation in ending this travesty. Without \r\nbringing the perpetrators of those crimes to justice, \r\nthere will be no lasting peace in the region. \r\n Uganda calls on the United Nations and the \r\nMember States to support the International Criminal \r\nCourt so that its credibility might not be doubted. The \r\nCourt must remain independent so that it is not viewed \r\nA/63/PV.35 \r\n \r\n08-58347 28 \r\n \r\nwith suspicion, as an institution designed to settle \r\npolitical scores. \r\n We welcome the outreach programmes of the \r\nCourt in Uganda because they enhance appreciation of \r\nthe international criminal justice system, especially by \r\nthe victims, who are the cardinal stakeholders. For its \r\npart, in order to reinforce this outreach effort, the \r\nGovernment of Uganda has offered to host the first \r\nreview conference of the Rome Statute in 2010 to \r\nfurther enhance the visibility of the Court in the region. \r\nWe welcome the support expressed for Uganda’s offer \r\nto host the review conference. \r\n Uganda will continue to cooperate with and \r\nsupport the International Criminal Court. This is \r\nevident in our effort to provide well-qualified \r\npersonnel to the bench and other organs of the Court. \r\n Uganda does not support impunity. We recognize \r\nthat it is a cardinal objective of the Rome Statute to \r\nend impunity and to bring to justice the perpetrators of \r\nthe most serious crimes. That is why Uganda was the \r\nfirst to make a referral to the Court in order to \r\ninvestigate the Lord’s Resistance Army. Indeed, the \r\nProsecutor’s investigation and application resulted in \r\nindictments and arrest warrants, which, unfortunately,  \r\n \r\nhave yet to be enforced. International cooperation is \r\ncrucial in any effort to secure any arrests, particularly \r\nsince the fugitives are outside the territory of Uganda. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 69.  \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I wish to inform members \r\nof a slight change in the programme of work for \r\nMonday morning, 3 November 2008. The Assembly \r\nwill first take up, in a joint debate, agenda item 40, \r\n“Report of the Economic and Social Council”, and \r\nagenda item 44, “Integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits in \r\nthe economic, social and related fields”. The Assembly \r\nwill then take up, as the second item, agenda item 114, \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand other organizations”, with its sub-items, followed \r\nby agenda item 59, “Holocaust remembrance”, as the \r\nthird item. \r\n \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m. \r\n"
