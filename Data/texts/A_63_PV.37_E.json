Now more than \r\never, regional organizations and arrangements have \r\nplayed a pivotal role in bringing countries together and \r\nnurturing a habit of consultation and cooperation in all \r\nareas of common concern and interest. ASEAN \r\nwelcomes that blossoming and strengthening of \r\nregionalism because we see regionalism as a building \r\nblock of, and a supporting pillar for, the effective \r\nglobal multilateralism that is embodied in the United \r\nNations. \r\n We are also witnessing a blossoming of \r\npartnership between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations. ASEAN welcomes the increasing \r\nemphasis that the United Nations has given to forging \r\npartnerships with many regional organizations in all \r\nregions of the world. Such a partnership in this \r\ninterdependent and globalized world is truly a win-win \r\nrelationship. By engaging with regional organizations, \r\nthe United Nations benefits from their in-depth and \r\nunique understanding about the challenges, concerns, \r\nsensitivities and nuances of those regions. At the same \r\ntime, regional organizations would benefit from the \r\nUnited Nations vast wealth of expertise, best practices \r\nand networks in a broad range of issues. \r\n ASEAN is committed to continuing to advance \r\nthe noble principles and objectives of the United \r\nNations in South-East Asia. For over 40 years since its \r\nfounding in 1967, ASEAN has emerged as a stable \r\nforce for regional peace and security, for enhanced \r\neconomic integration and for the creation of a \r\ncommunity of caring and sharing societies. Through \r\nASEAN, countries of South-East Asia come together \r\nand peacefully interact on all issues of common \r\nconcern for the region. Through habit of working \r\ntogether and consensus-making, ASEAN countries \r\nhave been successful in turning enmity into amity. By \r\nmanaging differences and emphasizing commonalities, \r\nASEAN as a group has managed to overcome \r\nsuccessive challenges facing the region. But ASEAN \r\nknows that we cannot be complacent. And that is why \r\nwe are witnessing a renaissance of ASEAN in South-\r\nEast Asia.  \r\n At the ASEAN summit in Singapore last year, \r\nASEAN leaders came together with common \r\nobjectives in mind: to make South-East Asia a better \r\nplace, to make ASEAN a stronger organization and to \r\nensure that ASEAN will continue to be a strong and \r\neffective partner for international peace, stability and \r\nprosperity.  \r\n At that summit in Singapore, ASEAN leaders \r\ntook a bold step forward by signing a landmark \r\nASEAN Charter, which will provide a legal and \r\ninstitutional framework to make ASEAN a more rules-\r\nbased, people-centred, effective and efficient \r\norganization. The signing of the ASEAN Charter was a \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n3 08-58387 \r\n \r\nsignificant milestone in the ASEAN community-\r\nbuilding process, whose goal is to transform a region \r\nthat is home to over 500 million people into an ASEAN \r\nCommunity by 2015. It is also important to note that, \r\nby signing the ASEAN Charter, ASEAN leaders have \r\ncommitted themselves to the principles of democracy, \r\nthe rule of law and good governance, and respect for \r\nand protection of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms, while respecting the fundamental importance \r\nof amity and cooperation and the principles of \r\nsovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, \r\nnon-interference, consensus and unity in diversity. \r\nToday, the ASEAN member States are working to ratify \r\nthe ASEAN Charter in time for its entry into force at \r\nthe fourteenth ASEAN summit, in Thailand in \r\nDecember 2008.  \r\n Partnership between ASEAN and the United \r\nNations has been long and enduring and has grown \r\nfrom strength to strength. The United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme was designated an ASEAN \r\nDialogue Partner in 1977 and has since been working \r\nclosely with ASEAN in a wide range of regional \r\ndevelopment issues. In 2006, ASEAN was granted \r\nobserver status in the General Assembly. In 2007, the \r\nSecretaries-General of ASEAN and the United Nations \r\nsigned a memorandum of understanding on ASEAN-\r\nUnited Nations cooperation to promote a full range of \r\ncooperation based on mutual benefits.  \r\n However, it took the tragic Cyclone Nargis in \r\nMay 2008 to really test and prove the strength and \r\nresilience of the partnership between ASEAN and the \r\nUnited Nations. In response to that natural disaster, \r\nASEAN firmly adhered to the ASEAN way that \r\nemphasizes understanding, dialogue and, most \r\nimportant, trust and confidence, while being clear \r\nabout the need for the group to act. Thus the ASEAN \r\nHumanitarian Task Force for the Victims of the \r\nCyclone Nargis was established in May this year by \r\nASEAN Foreign Ministers to work closely with the \r\nUnited Nations and Myanmar in coordinating \r\ninternational assistance. In so doing, ASEAN \r\nsuccessfully acted to build a diplomatic bridge with the \r\ninternational community through the United Nations.  \r\n It is evident that the ASEAN-led coordination \r\nmechanism and the Tripartite Core Group subsequently \r\nestablished on the basis of partnership between \r\nMyanmar, ASEAN and the United Nations have played \r\na pivotal role in ensuring the timely, coordinated, \r\nsystematic and effective delivery and utilization of \r\nemergency humanitarian relief supplies, as well as \r\nplanning for recovery and rebuilding efforts over the \r\nlonger term. That partnership has been welcomed by all \r\nsides, including the United Nations, as a successful \r\nmodel of cooperation that could be applied to other \r\nregions facing humanitarian emergencies. \r\n We are determined to sustain and build on that \r\npositive momentum of partnership between ASEAN \r\nand the United Nations. In December this year, the \r\nthird ASEAN-United Nations summit will be held in \r\nThailand. It will provide a good opportunity for \r\nASEAN leaders and the Secretary-General, as well as \r\nheads of United Nations agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes, to forge a comprehensive and system-\r\nwide partnership between ASEAN and the United \r\nNations.  \r\n ASEAN believes that there are many endeavours \r\nin which ASEAN and the United Nations could benefit \r\nfrom working together on critical areas of global \r\nconcern, such as mitigating the impacts of the current \r\nglobal financial crisis and other pressing issues such as \r\nattaining the Millennium Development Goals, food and \r\nenergy security, environmental management and \r\nclimate change, strengthening global and regional \r\ncooperation on disaster management, and fighting \r\nagainst deadly infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and avian flu. \r\n This year, ASEAN will also submit a biennial \r\ndraft resolution on cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations under this agenda item. The draft resolution is \r\nbased on the most recent resolution on that subject \r\n(resolution 61/46), which the Assembly adopted by \r\nconsensus in December 2006. The draft resolution \r\ncontains factual updates on positive developments \r\nregarding cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nASEAN during the past two years. ASEAN hopes that \r\nthis draft resolution will enjoy strong support from our \r\npartners, as in the past. \r\n ASEAN is going through an exciting time in its \r\nevolution. It is transforming itself from a community of \r\nten ASEAN countries into an ASEAN community, from \r\na collection of different markets and production bases \r\ninto a single market and production base, and from a \r\ncommunity of ten identities into a community based on \r\na common identity. \r\n ASEAN is confident that, together as one in the \r\nspirit of ASEAN solidarity, we will succeed in \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 4 \r\n \r\nachieving the goal that we have set for ourselves. \r\nASEAN’s success will be the success of the United \r\nNations because a stronger, more cohesive and \r\neffective ASEAN will be a stronger and more effective \r\npartner for the United Nations. \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): I have the honour to \r\npresent this statement on behalf of members of the \r\nPacific Islands Forum based in New York, namely: \r\nAustralia, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, \r\nNauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, \r\nTuvalu, Vanuatu and New Zealand. \r\n At the outset, I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional and other organizations (A/63/228). The \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nPacific Islands Forum has gained momentum in recent \r\nyears, and we are pleased that the United Nations has \r\nobserver status at the Forum. \r\n We encourage regular consultations between our \r\nForum’s Secretariat and the United Nations, as well as \r\nUnited Nations participation in meetings of Pacific \r\nIslands Forum leaders. \r\n We welcome the cooperation of United Nations \r\nfunds, programmes and specialized agencies to help the \r\nPacific Islands address and overcome the ever-growing \r\nchallenges before us, especially the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The \r\nUnited Nations “delivering as one”, processes are \r\nalready under way in the Pacific region. The \r\ndevelopment of the United Nations development \r\nassistance framework for the Pacific subregion, which \r\ncovers the period from 2008 to 2012 and brings \r\ntogether 15 United Nations agencies located in several \r\ndifferent countries, has been a significant step towards \r\nimplementing this “delivering as one” approach. \r\n We also need to work closely together to ensure \r\nfull and effective implementation of the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the \r\nBarbados Programme of Action and the Johannesburg \r\nPlan of Implementation. \r\n Global financial and economic turbulence and the \r\nthreat of global recession pose great risks to us all. \r\nSmall, isolated economies like many of those in our \r\nregion are especially vulnerable. The Forum’s \r\nengagement with the United Nations and its funds and \r\nprogrammes helps to address those areas of \r\nvulnerability and to strengthen national and regional \r\ndevelopment, thereby strengthening our region’s ability \r\nto engage with the international community. \r\n We can already point to a number of areas of \r\nvaluable cooperation with the United Nations. The \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has \r\nsupported implementation of the Forum’s Pacific Plan, \r\nwhich is the overarching framework for collaboration \r\nand cooperation among Forum countries. We also \r\nappreciate the work done by UNDP and the Economic \r\nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific to \r\nsupport the integration of MDGs into national \r\ndevelopment strategies in our region. Other assistance \r\nhas been provided in the areas of disaster risk \r\nmanagement, human security, anti-corruption, private \r\nsector development and disabilities issues. \r\n Donor coordination and aid delivery in \r\naccordance with the principles of the Paris Declaration \r\non Aid Effectiveness has been a growing focus in our \r\nregion. Pacific leaders have adopted the Pacific Aid \r\nEffectiveness Principles, emphasizing the importance \r\nof this work to all of us. We welcome the work of the \r\nUNDP Pacific Centre on enhancing donor coordination \r\nin the region, and we look forward to continuing to \r\nwork closely with United Nations agencies in that \r\nrespect. \r\n We are grateful too for the work done by the \r\nUnited Nations Environmental Programme in our \r\nregion on sustainable development, and for its support \r\nfor the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment \r\nProgramme (SPREP), which is involved in a range of \r\nenvironmental programmes in the Pacific. UNICEF’s \r\nefforts that focus on improved nutrition, child \r\nimmunization, better quality child-focused data and \r\nbudgeting are much needed. We also welcome \r\nengagement between United Nations agencies and \r\nPacific regional organizations in coordinating our \r\nresponse on HIV and sexually transmitted infections. \r\n These areas of cooperation, and many others not \r\nlisted, are greatly valued, as is the strengthened United \r\nNations presence in our region in recent years. \r\nHowever, we do believe that there is still scope to do \r\nsignificantly more and, in particular, to increase the \r\nimpact of the partnerships between the United Nations \r\nsystem and the Pacific Islands Forum. We urge all \r\nUnited Nations agencies operating in the region to \r\nconstantly assess their role and engagements against \r\nthat of Pacific regional agencies. It is critical that we \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n5 08-58387 \r\n \r\nall look to maximize collaborative action and avoid \r\nduplication. \r\n Finally, we note that the Pacific Islands Forum \r\ncovers a vast region of island States and that our region \r\nis particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate \r\nchange. A draft resolution entitled “Security and \r\nclimate change” (A/63/L.8) has been submitted by \r\nPacific small island developing States under agenda \r\nitem 107. We encourage all Member States to support \r\nthat draft resolution. \r\n Mr. Butagira (Uganda): I have the honour of \r\nspeaking on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC) Group in New York. I would like to \r\nthank and commend the Secretary-General for the \r\ncomprehensive and informative biennial report on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand other organizations (A/63/228). From the outset, I \r\nwish to reiterate the commitment of the OIC to \r\ndeepening its cooperation with the United Nations. \r\n I would also like to acknowledge the successful \r\noutcome of the biennial general meeting on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIC, \r\nheld in Geneva from 8 to 10 July 2008. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report captures some of the major outcomes \r\nof this meeting, some of which I would like to \r\nhighlight today as they merit inclusion in the upcoming \r\nresolution on OIC-United Nations cooperation. \r\n First, the report enumerates the efforts undertaken \r\nby the two organizations in enhancing practical \r\ncooperation and building complementarity through \r\nregular meetings at the level of the Secretaries-General \r\nand through consultations among other critical actors, \r\nincluding the Special Adviser on the International \r\nCompact with Iraq, the Executive Director of the \r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate \r\nand the High-level Coordinator on the issue of the \r\nrepatriation or return of all Kuwaiti and third country \r\nnationals or their remains. \r\n Secondly, the report draws attention to the \r\nInternational Conference on Terrorism, held in \r\nNovember 2007 in Tunisia and coordinated by the two \r\norganizations in partnership with the Government of \r\nTunisia, where a fruitful exchange of views took place. \r\nParticipants dispelled misapprehensions about Islam, \r\nidentified vulnerable areas exploited by terrorists in the \r\nsocial, cultural, ethical and ideological spheres, and \r\nrecommended solutions to make those areas less \r\nconducive to their use. \r\n Thirdly, the report notes that the Geneva meeting \r\nof the representatives of the United Nations system and \r\nOIC and its specialized institutions in July reviewed \r\ncooperation in various fields, including science, \r\ntechnology, trade, development, implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), refugees, \r\nhuman resource development, food security, \r\nagriculture, environment, health, population, arts, \r\ncrafts and promotion of heritage. Both sides also \r\nagreed to improve follow-up mechanisms by \r\nidentifying focal points and exchanging lists of \r\nofficials specializing in areas of common interest. \r\n Fourthly, the report notes that the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs has been \r\ndeveloping a dialogue with OIC to reach out to \r\nnon-governmental organizations and other \r\nhumanitarian actors in Islamic countries, and that \r\nUNICEF has been exploring ways to develop and \r\nformalize its partnership with OIC, including specific \r\ninitiatives linked to the MDGs as part of the OIC Ten-\r\nYear Programme of Action. \r\n I commend the Secretary-General for \r\nhighlighting the aforementioned developments and \r\nurge follow-up in the implementation of agreed \r\nactivities and programmes.  \r\n I would now like to draw attention to several \r\nother equally important issues, undertakings and \r\ndecisions pertaining to OIC-United Nations \r\ncooperation that did not appear in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, which also require follow-up and \r\nimplementation. \r\n First is the general meeting’s acknowledgement \r\nthat the OIC remains an important partner to the United \r\nNations in peace and security and in fostering a culture \r\nof peace at the global level, and the agreement between \r\nthe two sides to continue cooperation in conflict \r\nprevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  \r\n Second is the United Nations offer to inform the \r\nOIC of and invite it to seminars and other training \r\nopportunities in the areas of conflict prevention, \r\nnegotiations, mediation and elections organized by and \r\nfor the United Nations. \r\n Third are the efforts of the two organizations to \r\npromote and facilitate the Middle East peace process in \r\naccordance with relevant Security Council resolutions, \r\nparticularly resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and \r\n1515 (2003), General Assembly resolution 194 (III), \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 6 \r\n \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative, the Road Map and the \r\ncommitments of the Annapolis Conference. Those \r\nshould be recognized, and inter-organizational \r\ncooperation in all fields that serve that goal should be \r\nencouraged. \r\n Fourth, the OIC proposal for greater interaction \r\nbetween the two Secretariats beyond the current \r\nbiennial arrangement to include a periodic review of \r\ncooperation should be acknowledged through \r\nappropriate follow-up directives. \r\n Fifth is the close cooperation between the OIC \r\nSecretariat and the United Nations Alliance of \r\nCivilizations in advancing dialogue and intercultural \r\nunderstanding, including the Secretary-General’s \r\nparticipation in the OIC summit inviting the Alliance to \r\nall major OIC conferences, and holding meetings \r\nbetween the OIC Secretary-General and the High \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations to institutionalize cooperation \r\nbetween the two organizations and finalize a \r\nmemorandum of understanding between the two \r\norganizations. \r\n Sixth is multifaceted cooperation among the OIC \r\nand the United Nations and its specialized agencies in \r\nhumanitarian affairs, which should be welcomed. There \r\nis a need to pursue greater proactive engagement, \r\nresulting in the implementation of concrete \r\nprogrammes in capacity-building, emergency assistance \r\nand strategic partnerships. \r\n Seventh, the two organizations should strengthen \r\ncooperation in fighting poverty in Member States to \r\npromote sustainable development and achieve the \r\nMDGs. \r\n Lastly, at the Annual Coordination Meeting of the \r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Member States of the \r\nIslamic Conference, held on 26 September 2008 here at \r\nthe United Nations, it was decided to celebrate the \r\nfortieth anniversary of the OIC in 2009 with national \r\nand international programmes on different aspects of \r\nthe OIC, highlighting its activities, evolution and \r\nreform. The OIC looks forward to collaborating with \r\nthe United Nations in the commemoration. \r\n I would like to conclude by underlining the \r\nessential role that cooperation between the United \r\nNations and regional and other organizations can play \r\nin the achievement of international peace and \r\nprosperity, including the MDGs. However, our \r\napproach must be pragmatic and holistic to ensure that \r\nagreed activities are implemented. That will require the \r\nwider international community to lend its full support \r\nto attaining that objective. The OIC Group will be \r\ntabling a draft resolution under agenda item 114 — \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand other organizations — and we look forward to the \r\nfull support of all our partners. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Building a collective approach, which is \r\ncrucial to overcome temporary threats and challenges \r\neffectively, requires a gradual strengthening of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand subregional organizations, based on the firm \r\nfoundation of the United Nations Charter, especially \r\nChapter VIII.  \r\n The United Nations and regional organizations \r\nare intended to complement each other harmoniously \r\nand to make use of their specific comparative \r\nadvantages. With respect to the United Nations, that \r\nmeans above all universality of membership and of \r\nareas of activity and universally recognized legitimacy. \r\nIn turn, regional organizations often have a better \r\nunderstanding of local circumstances and more suitable \r\nequipment, as well as their own sources of financing. A \r\nclear division of labour, while maintaining the \r\nprerogatives of the United Nations and its Security \r\nCouncil, will make it possible to increase the capacity \r\nin the international community for dealing with crises.  \r\n We think that regular meetings of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations with leaders of regional \r\norganizations are extremely relevant. The United \r\nNations agenda of cooperation with its regional \r\npartners is becoming more ambitious and multifaceted. \r\nTo peacekeeping and peacebuilding goals have been \r\nadded combating the spread of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons, resolving other destabilizing cross-border \r\nproblems, fighting drug trafficking and organized \r\ncrime and contributing to solving the various complex \r\nsocio-economic issues around the world. \r\n The Russian Federation continues to strongly \r\nsupport further strengthening multifaceted cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization (CSTO), the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States (CIS) and the Eurasian Economic \r\nCommunity (EURASEC), which has made significant \r\ncontributions to overcoming contemporary problems \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n7 08-58387 \r\n \r\nand challenges at both the regional and global levels. \r\nWe welcome the already solid ties those regional \r\nmechanisms have with the United Nations and their \r\njoint implementation of a number of projects and \r\nprogrammes. \r\n Integrated processes in our region have become \r\nmore mature and active and have increasingly drawn in \r\ncountries from neighbouring subregions. The legal, \r\ninstitutional and financial basis for that kind of \r\ncooperation is becoming firmly established. Within the \r\nCIS, CSTO and EURASEC, systematic and \r\ncomprehensive interaction is under way, including in \r\nsuch areas as ensuring security, peacekeeping, fighting \r\norganized and cross-border crime, economic \r\ndevelopment and trade, environmental protection, \r\nhumanitarian relief operations and regulation of \r\nmigration. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCSTO has considerable potential. Within the CSTO, \r\nvery intensive work is under way to establish its own \r\nin-house peacekeeping potential, including for use in \r\nthe framework of United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. There are considerable opportunities for \r\npooling the efforts of those two organizations. \r\n Cooperation between CSTO member States on \r\nUnited Nations issues is based not only on common \r\npositions on many of the current problems on the \r\nUnited Nations agenda, but also on an understanding of \r\nthe need to strengthen its leading role in international \r\naffairs. We are interested in maximizing the collective \r\nmechanisms and potential of the United Nations in \r\nneutralizing challenges to regional security arising \r\nfrom international terrorism and in contributing to \r\neconomic development. \r\n The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is \r\nplaying an increasing role in ensuring stability in the \r\nEurasian region. Its members favour further developing \r\ntheir cooperation with the United Nations in a number \r\nof very important areas, including fighting \r\ninternational terrorism and the illegal drug trade, thus \r\ncontributing to the post-conflict reconstruction of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n In the very near future, the States of the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization intend to raise the issue of \r\nincluding on the agenda of the Assembly’s sixty-fourth \r\nsession a new item on cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. \r\n We also support further strengthening cooperation \r\nbetween the Eurasian Economic Community and the \r\nUnited Nations. EURASEC is developing rapidly at \r\npresent. Cooperation is under way on a number of key \r\nissues, including transport cooperation, energy, \r\ntourism, environmental protection, overcoming \r\nemergency situations, migration, education and other \r\nareas. Within the Community, steps have been taken to \r\nestablish a customs union, a free trade area and a single \r\nenergy market. \r\n Now that intensive and practical activity is fully \r\nin line with the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and further strengthens the \r\ncommitment to the principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter, which is enshrined in the constitutive \r\ndocuments of the Community. The Eurasian Economic \r\nCommunity furthermore has played a key role in the \r\nextensive structures of multilateral cooperation in the \r\nregion aimed at ensuring sustainable development, \r\nstability, peace and security. That makes it an \r\nimportant partner of the United Nations system in our \r\nregion and points to the need to further step up efforts \r\nto develop cooperation between the two organizations. \r\n According to the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nthe main achievements in that area have been \r\nhighlighted. We welcome those achievements, but we \r\nbelieve it is necessary to further strengthen \r\ncooperation. With a view to strengthening the results of \r\nthat cooperation, Russia has, together with Belarus, the \r\ncurrent president of the Community, submitted to the \r\nUnited Nations a draft resolution on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Eurasian \r\nEconomic Community. We attach great importance to \r\nthe adoption of the draft resolution by consensus and \r\nwish to thank all delegations that have taken part in its \r\nelaboration and have joined its original two sponsors.  \r\n We also think that the potential for mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nother integration mechanisms in the territory of the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States is far from \r\nhaving been exhausted. In that context, we expect more \r\nactivity, initiative and openness to dialogue from the \r\nleadership of the United Nations agencies. Russia is \r\nready to do its part to work towards further \r\nstrengthening that cooperation. \r\n I would like also to mention the issue of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Black \r\nSea Economic Cooperation Organization (BSEC). \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 8 \r\n \r\nRussia is an active and concerned member of that main \r\ncomprehensive forum for Black Sea cooperation. We \r\nsupport efforts to further increase the work of that \r\norganization and to adapt it to current realities. We are \r\nconvinced that ensuring stable development, prosperity \r\nand security in the region will require the \r\nimplementation of long-term mutually beneficial \r\neconomic projects carried out in the framework of the \r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. We \r\nthink that projects such as the circular motorway \r\naround the Black Sea and the establishment of a \r\ncircular Black Sea electric power grid are excellent \r\nexamples of that kind of project.  \r\n We support the work already under way in the \r\nBSEC to create a common energy strategy for countries \r\nin the region. We think that cooperation between the \r\nBSEC and the European Union should be based on \r\nequal footing and mutual benefit and the Community \r\npreserve, even augment, its own identity. The BSEC is \r\nalso ready to cooperate with countries outside the \r\nregion. That participation should be based on the \r\nprinciple of non-interference in the development of \r\nmultilateral cooperation between the countries of the \r\nregion on the basis of their interests, capacities, skills \r\nand experience. It would be especially \r\ncounterproductive to try to politicize economic ties in \r\nthe region and cooperation in the framework of the \r\nBSEC.  \r\n We believe the BSEC has an excellent future. The \r\norganization is a functioning part of the overall \r\nEuropean cooperation system and the integration \r\nprocesses on the continent and is able to play a role in \r\nbringing the peoples of the region closer together and \r\nis finding balance and common ground in the Black \r\nSea region. By strengthening its cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations, we will further contribute to that \r\nprogress. Russia fully supports the draft resolution on \r\nthe matter and has become one of its sponsors. \r\n We also think that cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe is moving \r\nalong nicely. The development of cooperation between \r\nthose two organizations will contribute to ensuring \r\npeace and security and will protect human rights, not \r\nonly in Europe but around the world as a whole. \r\n The draft resolution on the cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe \r\n(A/63/L.12), which is being considered by the General \r\nAssembly today, fully meets those goals, and we hope \r\nthat, just as it was two years ago, it will be adopted by \r\nconsensus. \r\n We would like to see further development of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and other \r\nEuropean organizations, including the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the European \r\nUnion, where mechanisms for reacting to emergencies \r\nare being developed. What is essential there is to fully \r\nrecognize the primary responsibility of the United \r\nNations Security Council for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, including the \r\nimposition of mandatory sanctions and political control \r\nover peace enforcement operations. That fundamental \r\nprinciple based upon Chapter VIII of the Charter \r\nshould also govern cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  \r\n We must further increase positive cooperation \r\nbetween the Organization and regional and subregional \r\npartners in Africa, including the African Union, the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States, the \r\nSouthern African Development Community and the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development.  \r\n An important role in seeking peaceful solutions to \r\nthe many problems of their regions will be played by \r\nthe League of Arab States, the Cooperation Council for \r\nthe Arab States of the Gulf, the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, the Organization of American \r\nStates and various Latin American organizations. \r\nRussia has established and is developing dynamic \r\nrelationships with all of those organizations. \r\n Mr. Menon (Singapore): Allow me to first thank \r\nthe Secretary-General and the Secretariat for the report \r\non cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nregional and other organizations (A/63/228). We would \r\nalso like to associate ourselves with the statement \r\nmade by Thailand on behalf of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and commend the \r\nSecretary-General for his leadership and support in \r\nfostering and strengthening cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and ASEAN. \r\n Much of our work in this session has been \r\nclouded by bad news. The lack of progress in the Doha \r\nRound, the food and fuel price crises, the financial \r\nmeltdown on Wall Street and the resultant economic \r\nturmoil across the globe have all cast a long shadow \r\nover our deliberations at the sixty-third session of the \r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. We have had \r\ndebates on the role that the United Nations can and \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n9 08-58387 \r\n \r\nshould play to restore global confidence during this \r\ntime of economic, social and political crises. Smaller \r\ncountries like mine have a strong vested interest in \r\nseeing international institutions strengthened, so that \r\nthey can better deal with the various problems.  \r\n While reform of the United Nations and the \r\nBretton Woods institutions is important and urgent, we \r\ncan also make these international institutions more \r\neffective by encouraging them to forge strong \r\npartnerships with regional institutions that play useful \r\nroles in fostering regional peace and development. \r\nIndeed, even the United Nations Charter recognizes the \r\nrole that regional arrangements can play in helping the \r\nUnited Nations to achieve its various objectives. Take \r\nASEAN as an example: many of you will recall that, \r\nwhen Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar in May this year \r\nand caused a humanitarian crisis in the country, there \r\nwas for several days a stand-off between the Myanmar \r\nGovernment and the international community over the \r\nprovision of assistance. ASEAN had to step in and \r\nbuild a bridge of trust between the Myanmar \r\nGovernment and the international community.  \r\n A tripartite organization involving the United \r\nNations, ASEAN and the Myanmar Government \r\nworked effectively to overcome problems on the \r\nground and ensured that international aid reached the \r\nfurthest corners of the affected area. It also prevented a \r\nsecond wave of deaths from hunger or disease. ASEAN \r\non its own did not have the capabilities to help \r\nMyanmar in a major way, but ASEAN working \r\ntogether with the United Nations and other \r\ninternational agencies was able to make a huge \r\ndifference. In the process, we in ASEAN also learned a \r\ngreat deal about disaster management from bodies like \r\nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\nand the World Food Programme. \r\n Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n However, it is also a fact that every region has its \r\nown distinctive characteristics, which must be taken \r\ninto account when building partnerships between the \r\nUnited Nations and the particular region. It may or \r\nmay not be possible to replicate what ASEAN was able \r\nto achieve with the United Nations in the case of \r\nCyclone Nargis, in other parts of the globe. In short, \r\nthere is no one-size-fits-all model for cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional institutions. \r\nTo expect otherwise would be to ignore the fact that \r\nevery region has its own unique characteristics, \r\npriorities and needs. The Secretary-General’s report \r\nmakes that point and shows how wide-ranging such \r\nmodels of partnership can be. \r\n Unfortunately, instead of celebrating the rich \r\ndiversity that exists in the global community, my \r\ndelegation has observed a tendency on the part of some \r\nMember States to try to impose some of their values \r\nand practices at the regional level on the rest of the \r\nglobal community. They expect the rest of us to \r\nwelcome those values and practices, which are peculiar \r\nto their region, and to embrace them as universal \r\nvalues.  \r\n Some members may recall that, in 2004, my \r\ndelegation took the floor during the debate on this \r\nsame agenda item to object to an attempt by the \r\nCouncil of Europe to impose its views regarding the \r\ndeath penalty upon the rest of us through its resolution \r\non cooperation with the United Nations. In that regard, \r\nmy delegation was baffled by the attempt by the \r\nCouncil of Europe again this year to slip similar and \r\neven more controversial elements into its draft \r\nresolution and to expect all of us to go along with it. \r\nFortunately, consensus on that resolution was \r\npreserved, at least as of now, because the Swedish \r\nchair of the informal consultations exercised strong \r\nleadership and professional objectivity during the \r\nnegotiations. \r\n All of us should acknowledge that in a universal \r\norganization such as the United Nations, there will be \r\nsome occasions when we will not necessarily be able to \r\nagree with one another because of our different values \r\nor practices. Our task will certainly be more \r\ncomplicated if some delegations insist on disregarding \r\nthe valid concerns of others and attempting to impose \r\ntheir views on the rest of the United Nations \r\nmembership. \r\n When we are confronted by multiple crises, either \r\nat home or at the global level, we should all rise to the \r\nchallenge and work in collaboration to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. This is no \r\ntime to be running roughshod over each other’s views. \r\nWe can only achieve a “we community” — a concept \r\nthat the President of the General Assembly has often \r\ntalked about — when we learn the basic rule of respect \r\nand empathy for each other’s views, and that has to \r\nstart here in the Assembly. \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 10 \r\n \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada) (spoke in French): \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations is an essential tool for the achievement \r\nof the objectives of the United Nations and its various \r\nbodies. That cooperation is key to peace and security \r\nefforts. The expertise of and means of regional \r\norganizations complement those of the United Nations, \r\nand thereby enhance the contributions of each.  \r\n Canada has established partnerships with various \r\nplayers, such as the African Union, the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States, the Southern Africa \r\nDevelopment Community, the Organization of \r\nAmerican States (OAS), the Caribbean Community, the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (OSCE), on a host of issues. Those partnerships \r\nillustrate the importance we place on the involvement \r\nof regional players. \r\n We would also like to reiterate the \r\nresponsibilities of Member States to support \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and various \r\norganizations in order to ensure that such cooperation \r\nis effective. For example, donors and countries \r\ncontributing troops to peace missions under the aegis \r\nof various organizations must ensure that those troops \r\nare endowed with the resources they need to carry out \r\ntheir mandates. \r\n The partnership between the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union in Darfur illustrates a number of \r\npossibilities and demonstrates the challenges which \r\nsuch cooperation poses. That cooperation is still \r\nnecessary to foster African solutions to threats to peace \r\nand security on that continent. Because peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa are closely related to the human \r\nrights situation, governance and development, \r\nextensive cooperation among the relevant bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union is also \r\nnecessary. \r\n I would like to highlight further examples of \r\ncooperation with regional partners that are relevant to \r\nthe United Nations. Canada’s working, for example, to \r\ndevelop practical approaches to cooperation with the \r\nASEAN Regional Forum. In addition, we are \r\nmonitoring the cohesion between the efforts of the \r\nOAS and other regional institutions in the Americas. \r\nWe are also following cooperation efforts between the \r\nOAS and all of the parties that support development in \r\nHaiti. We would also like to highlight the joint \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and NATO in \r\nAfghanistan. We welcome the cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, particularly in Kosovo \r\nand Georgia. \r\n The United Nations and regional organizations \r\nmust also cooperate closely to integrate fragile States \r\ninto the world economy. The United Nations must also \r\nwork with regional economic organizations in order to \r\nparticipate in development efforts. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nspecifically address cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie (OIF). The OIF has diplomatic \r\ncapabilities in the areas of prevention and mediation \r\nthat we would like to see strengthened so that the \r\nOrganization can help resolve international crises more \r\neffectively, particularly in certain francophone \r\ncountries, and fully participate in finding collective \r\nand realistic solutions.  \r\n A few days ago, the twelfth francophone summit \r\nwas held in Quebec City, with some 30 heads of State \r\nor Government, the Secretary-General of the OIF and \r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations in \r\nattendance. The summit was an opportunity to discuss \r\nissues that are mobilizing the international community, \r\nsuch as the financial crisis, and to focus on four other \r\nmajor issues within the francophone world: democracy \r\nand the rule of law; governance and economic \r\nsolidarity; the environment; and the French language. \r\n The heads of State or Government adopted the \r\nQuebec City declaration, which contains specific and \r\nconcrete commitments on each of those major issues. \r\nArmenia’s status changed from observer to associate \r\nmember at the summit, and Thailand and Latvia were \r\nadmitted as observers. The OIF is now comprised of \r\n70 States and Governments. \r\n A high point in cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the francophone world came on 28 March \r\n2008, when the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations and the Secretary-General of the OIF reviewed \r\ninternational policy issues and welcomed the similarity \r\nof their views on world peace, peaceful conflict \r\nresolution, the implementation of the Convention on \r\nthe Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of \r\nCultural Expressions, and the dialogue among cultures \r\nand civilizations. They also expressed the desire to \r\nimplement operational mechanisms to facilitate \r\nconsultations, the ability to refer issues to one another \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n11 08-58387 \r\n \r\nand coordination between the two organizations in the \r\ncontext of preventing, managing and resolving \r\nconflicts that may arise in the francophone world. \r\n Cooperation between the two organizations also \r\nrequires the enhancement of the OIF’s involvement in \r\nmobilizing francophone contingents in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. More than half of the troops \r\ndeployed by the United Nations are serving in \r\nfrancophone countries. While the number of such \r\nmissions is increasing, the number of French-speaking \r\npersonnel engaged in those operations is declining, \r\nwhich is causing communications problems on the \r\nground. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOIF also necessitates a stronger OIF presence in \r\nPeacebuilding Commission activities, in particular in \r\nthe country-specific configurations for Burundi, \r\nGuinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic. Other \r\nareas of cooperation, in particular electoral observation \r\nand assistance, may also be enhanced.  \r\n Finally, cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the International Organization of la Francophonie \r\nis also key to the successful implementation of \r\nresolution 61/266, on multilingualism, adopted last \r\nyear. \r\n Resolution 61/7 currently defines the framework \r\nfor cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie. In the \r\ncoming days, Canada will submit a draft resolution \r\ndesigned to update the parameters of that framework in \r\nthe wake of the recent adoption of the Quebec City \r\ndeclaration a few days ago, with a view to guiding joint \r\nactivities in the coming years. We are delighted at the \r\nthought of seeing the results of that cooperation in the \r\ncoming months, which will pave the way for the \r\npreparations for the next Francophonie summit, to be \r\nheld in Madagascar in 2010. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n In conclusion, Canada, in cooperation with other \r\nMember States, will continue to ensure that \r\ncooperation between the two organizations remains \r\nproductive so that francophone experience is used to \r\nthe fullest extent in carrying out the United Nations \r\nmission, and so that the relationship becomes a model \r\nof complementarity between United Nations action and \r\nthat of regional organizations. Our capacity to manage \r\neffectively the wide range of issues facing us will \r\ndetermine how cooperation between the United \r\nNations, especially the Security Council, and regional \r\norganizations develops. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in French): The \r\ndebate that brings us together today gives us an \r\nexcellent opportunity to examine the state of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations and to reflect on how we can strengthen \r\ntheir links of synergy and interaction.  \r\n I take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the information he has provided in his \r\nsummary report on cooperation activities undertaken \r\nthese past two years (A/63/228). The report clearly \r\nshows the genuine will of the United Nations and the \r\nregional organizations concerned to consolidate and \r\ndiversify in various areas and at various levels their \r\ncooperation and their capacity to be complementary. \r\nMy delegation welcomes that fact because it is therein \r\nthat the objective of full cooperation between United \r\nNations and regional organizations takes on real \r\nsignificance and relevance. \r\n My delegation feels that regional cooperation, the \r\nstructure and scope of which have become increasingly \r\nmultidimensional and integrated, is now more than \r\never a supplementary tool for United Nations action \r\nand for the development of multilateralism. \r\nDevelopments on the international scene have clearly \r\nshown that the universality of the United Nations and \r\nthe regional approach can work together towards the \r\nsame objectives and optimize, upstream and down, \r\ntheir action and capacity to better serve the needs of \r\ndevelopment, peace and human understanding, and to \r\ndo so without a conflict of competence or mandate. \r\n Given the growing role that regional \r\norganizations play in international governance and in \r\nthe consensual approach to the situations facing the \r\nworld, my delegation feels that the organizations \r\ninvolved should, in that respect, be integrated as full \r\npartners in the United Nations dynamic. The regional \r\ncooperation dimension is also part of the revitalization \r\nof the United Nations and the achievement of its \r\ndevelopment goals, particularly the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.  \r\n We should remember in that respect that the \r\nSeptember 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \r\nstressed that aspect by recommending that we identify \r\nand adopt measures to strengthen cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations. \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 12 \r\n \r\nMoreover, the various biennial reports adopted under \r\nitem 114 evidence the growing interest that the United \r\nNations community accords to increasing cooperation \r\nand coordination and to the added value that the \r\nregional organizations provide at various levels.  \r\n Additionally, my delegation would like to take \r\nadvantage of this debate to remind regional \r\norganizations to strengthen consultation and \r\ncooperation among themselves, since they are guided \r\nby the common ideals of peace, development and \r\ndialogue among civilizations. \r\n As a member of a number of regional \r\norganizations, Tunisia is convinced that such valuable \r\ncooperation in various areas should be duly \r\nappreciated, better supported and better structured. In \r\nthat regard, cooperation activities between the United \r\nNations and the League of Arab States — the vitality \r\nand strengthening of which we welcome, particularly \r\nin the area of peace — should be further extended to \r\nother sectors more directly linked to development. In \r\npoint of fact, a number of meetings and joint activities \r\nhave taken place, including the coordination meeting in \r\nGeneva in July 2008 between the two parties that led to \r\nthe launching of various projects of common interest in \r\nthe economic, social, environmental, technical and \r\ncultural domains, attesting to the shared will to \r\nstrengthen institutional links, as well as the scope of \r\nand base for cooperation. The follow-up mechanism \r\nestablished on that occasion is certainly an important \r\npillar in the edifice of cooperation. We would have \r\nwished that the report of the Secretary-General had \r\ngiven more information with regard to the mandate and \r\nthe functioning of that mechanism, in particular its \r\nability to make periodic assessments of the status of \r\ncooperation. \r\n My delegation welcomes the fact that, over the \r\npast two years, cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the African Union has taken on another \r\ndimension and opened up new perspectives. There have \r\nbeen many successes, and we are now attempting to \r\naddress the specific needs of our continent, particularly \r\nin the area of peace and conflict management, in \r\nkeeping with the priorities established in the Ten-Year \r\nCapacity-Building Programme for the African Union, \r\npresented in the declaration Enhancing United Nations-\r\nAfrican Union Cooperation: Framework for the Ten-\r\nYear Capacity-Building Programme for the African \r\nUnion, the text of which was signed in Addis Ababa in \r\nNovember 2006. \r\n In that respect, the decision to set up a \r\ncoordination and consultation mechanism between the \r\nPeace and Security Council of the African Union and \r\nthe Security Council of the United Nations, as well as \r\njoint meetings to be held regularly between those two \r\nbodies in that framework undoubtedly meets the needs \r\nof our time, given that Africa is the theatre of most \r\nconflicts, and particularly since it provides edifying \r\nproof that structured, targeted and coordinated \r\ncooperation between the African Union and the United \r\nNations can contribute to the creation of an African \r\ncapacity for conflict prevention, peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n By dint of the political sensitivity of its basic \r\nstructure, cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union on the issues of peace and security \r\nhas monopolized attention, downplaying other aspects \r\nof cooperation — such as economic and social \r\nsupport — that while requiring less involvement and \r\nfewer resources, are nevertheless important. The goal \r\nis to support the process, of development in particular \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, at the national, regional and subregional levels, \r\nespecially since Africa is clearly behind with regard to \r\nthe agreed deadlines. \r\n Before concluding on that point, I would like to \r\nstress that my delegation can only welcome the \r\nsignificant efforts of the United Nations and its \r\nMember States in the area of peace and security in \r\nAfrica, and hopes that questions of economic and \r\nhuman development will enjoy the same level of \r\nattention and commitment. The development of Africa \r\ntoday is at the heart of the United Nations agenda and \r\nof the international community. \r\n My delegation notes with satisfaction the \r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC) in diverse and important economic, \r\npolitical, social and humanitarian fields. The OIC and \r\nits specialized agencies are deployed in various \r\ndomains and with numerous partners in order to \r\ncontribute to the efforts of the international community \r\nin the service of development, peace and security. \r\n In that framework, the international conference \r\nconvened by the United Nations and the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference in Tunis in November 2007, \r\nin cooperation with the Tunisian Government, on the \r\ntheme “Terrorism: Dimensions, Threats and \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n13 08-58387 \r\n \r\nCountermeasures”, has enabled us to identify solutions, \r\nto recommend paths of action and, in particular, to \r\nclear up a good number of misunderstandings at the \r\nheart of a certain erroneous perception of Islam. The \r\nconference illustrated the extent to which cooperation \r\nand exchanges enable us to take the road less travelled \r\nand to find common ground on subjects that are \r\napparently controversial or even conflictual. \r\n On another level, the meeting held in Geneva in \r\nJuly 2008 between the United Nations system and the \r\nOIC and its specialized institutions enabled us to assess \r\nthe level of cooperation and where it could be \r\nstrengthened. \r\n It is a fact that the world today faces many \r\nchallenges, and the fact that they are getting worse is \r\nindisputable. The only way the international \r\ncommunity can rise to those challenges is with \r\neveryone’s help, and a collective commitment. The \r\nprocess of complementarity between the universal \r\naction of the United Nations and the constructive \r\ncontribution of regional organizations itself arises from \r\nthat imperative. \r\n Ms. Negm (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me \r\nto start by expressing our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his excellent report on the cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other \r\norganizations (A/63/228). Egypt attaches special \r\nimportance to such cooperation for its significant role \r\nin helping to achieve the goals of the United Nations in \r\nits three main fields of work: international peace and \r\nsecurity, development in its political and economic \r\ndimensions, and the effective promotion of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report demonstrates the \r\ndepth of the relationship between the United Nations \r\nand regional and other organizations and the increasing \r\nlevels of steady cooperation between them. In that \r\ncontext, the delegation of Egypt welcomes the report’s \r\nfocus on the growing cooperation between United \r\nNations bodies and specialized agencies, on the one \r\nhand, and the African Union, on the other, in the areas \r\nof peace and security; the African Union’s institutional \r\ncapacity-building; mediation and conflict resolution; \r\nthe holding of elections; peacekeeping and support in \r\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) programmes; disarmament, \r\nespecially with respect to small arms and light \r\nweapons; and other areas associated with the \r\npromotion and development of industry, environmental \r\nprotection, refugee issues, and food and food security. \r\n In the field of development, cooperation must be \r\nstrengthened between both parties in order to confront \r\nthe world’s exceptional food, energy, global financial \r\nmarkets and climate change crises. Those crises will \r\naffect Africa more than another region. I also wish to \r\nstress the need to implement the political declaration \r\nissued at the recent high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on Africa’s development needs as well as the \r\nproposals put forward by the leaders at the high-level \r\nevent on the Millennium Development Goals. Those \r\nproposals aim at increasing financing for Africa and to \r\ngive it special consideration during the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus.  \r\n In the area of international peace and security, we \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s initiative to form a \r\njoint United Nations-African Union panel, chaired by \r\nformer Italian Prime Minister Prodi, in support of \r\nAfrican peacekeeping operations. We look forward to \r\nreceiving the panel’s report. Concurrently, we \r\nemphasize the importance of continuing to strengthen \r\ncooperation between the Security Council and the \r\nPeace and Security Council of the African Union so \r\nthat Africa can also contribute to maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security in other regions of the \r\nworld.  \r\n In the same context, I would like to refer to the \r\nimportant role played by the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in African countries emerging from \r\nconflict and its achievements during the first two years \r\nof its existence. The United Nations and the African \r\nUnion should encourage, sustain and support the \r\nCommission’s role. We also stress the need to assist \r\nand strengthen the capacities of the Commission by \r\nproviding the necessary financial resources from the \r\nregular budget of the United Nations, and to take the \r\nregional dimension of the process of reviewing the \r\nwork of the Peacebuilding Fund into consideration in \r\n2009 and 2010, in a manner that would help to \r\nstrengthen cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union. \r\n Cooperation between the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference (OIC) and the United Nations is \r\ngaining importance in the light of the negative \r\ncampaign against Islam and its symbols and of the \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 14 \r\n \r\nefforts of some to defend that campaign by citing \r\nfreedom of expression. This issue requires both \r\norganizations to step up their role in correcting the \r\nerroneous image of the Islamic world and in deepening \r\ncooperation among all peoples, regardless of their \r\nreligions and faiths. That, in turn, would require \r\nworking together in the fields of culture and education \r\nthrough dialogue among civilizations, cultures and \r\nreligions. In that regard, the delegation of Egypt \r\nencourages the holding of seminars and conferences in \r\ncooperation with the member States of both \r\norganizations so that such cooperation will produce \r\nconcrete results in promoting the culture of peace. It is \r\nour hope that the high-level meeting to be held in the \r\nmiddle of this month will constitute a further basis for \r\nstrengthening cooperation among all countries in that \r\nimportant area.  \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nLeague of Arab States is of equal and increasing \r\nimportance, not only because of the leading role of the \r\nUnited Nations in the process of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Middle East question and its role in \r\nthe diplomatic Quartet, but also in promoting the \r\ninternational process of addressing the case of the \r\nPalestinian refugees and ensuring their access to \r\nurgently needed humanitarian assistance, and in \r\nconfirming the fact that the United Nations remains at \r\nthe centre of the political process aimed at establishing \r\nan independent, viable Palestinian State with Jerusalem \r\nas its capital.  \r\n In that regard, it is necessary to immediately \r\ncommence the implementation of the agreement \r\nbetween the two organizations to strengthen the \r\ninstitutional links between their secretariats. The \r\nprocess will lead to the sharing of experience and of \r\nlessons learned, promote their joint efforts, and \r\nenhance their coordination with other regional \r\norganizations for the achievement of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n Regarding cooperation between the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO) \r\nand the United Nations, the delegation of Egypt \r\nwelcomes the consultations between both organizations \r\nin the various fields of international law. The Egyptian \r\ndelegation reiterates and affirms the importance of \r\nstrengthening such cooperation, especially with respect \r\nto the activities of AALCO’s Centre for Research and \r\nTraining to build capacities in the field of international \r\nlaw in all its branches and to ensure effective national \r\nimplementation of international law obligations.  \r\n The delegation of Egypt also affirms the \r\nimportance of strengthening cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie; of expanding it from merely cultural \r\ncooperation to cooperation in the fields of early \r\nwarning, conflict prevention, peacebuilding, \r\npeacekeeping capacity-building; and of developing, \r\nestablishing and implementing national strategies for \r\ndevelopment and other important areas that would \r\nenhance the goals of both organizations. \r\n The delegation of Egypt follows with keen \r\ninterest the growing cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union since the \r\nsigning of the 1996 Cooperation Agreement between \r\nthem; the adoption in 2002 of resolution 57/47 granting \r\nthe Union observer status; the organization of hearings \r\nand common interactive debates on the sidelines of \r\nsuccessive sessions of the General Assembly; and the \r\nparticipation of parliamentarians in the official \r\ndelegations of their countries to the General Assembly. \r\nThat growing cooperation clearly highlights the nature \r\nof the organic relationship between strengthening the \r\nprinciples of democracy, ensuring good governance at \r\nthe national and international levels and broadening the \r\nbasis for parliamentary participation in the multilateral \r\ninternational sphere.  \r\n Owing to the complexity and multifaceted nature \r\nof cooperation between the two organizations with \r\nregard to participation in relevant United Nations \r\nconferences, issues of international peace and security \r\nand efforts to promote and enhance economic and \r\nsocial development, democracy and human rights, and \r\ngiven Egypt’s leading role in promoting such \r\ncooperation during the chairmanship of Mr. Fathi \r\nSorour, Speaker of the People’s Assembly, we support \r\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendation, set out in \r\nparagraph 139 of the report, that the General Assembly \r\npositively consider devoting a specific agenda item to \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union. Egypt will participate \r\nactively in the consultations on that subject, which will \r\nbe considered during negotiations on the annual draft \r\nresolution on this item. \r\n The delegation of Egypt has closely followed the \r\nincreasing cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nmany organizations in Europe, Asia and Latin America, \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n15 08-58387 \r\n \r\nin particular the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization, the Caribbean Community, the Council \r\nof Europe and other organizations covered in the \r\nreport. We will follow up on efforts to enhance such \r\ncooperation in the future with a view to achieving the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. \r\n Mrs. Ithete (Namibia): The Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion (IPU), the world organization of national \r\nparliaments, is the natural institutional link between \r\nthe United Nations and the world of national \r\nparliaments. Namibia is particularly honoured that The \r\nHonourable Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Speaker of the \r\nNational Assembly of the Republic of Namibia, was \r\nelected as President of the IPU. We believe that his \r\nexperience as a former Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and President of the General Assembly \r\nwill certainly contribute to the strengthening of the \r\npartnership between the United Nations and the IPU. \r\n In order to bridge the implementation gap with \r\nregard to United Nations decisions and resolutions and \r\nto ensure greater democratization of the United Nations \r\nsystem, it is important to engage more closely with \r\nnational parliaments and parliamentarians all over the \r\nworld. Such engagement would give parliamentarians a \r\nbetter understanding of the importance of translating \r\ninternational commitments into national legislation and \r\npolicies. It would also provide greater political \r\nmomentum for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and addressing the major global challenges of \r\nour time. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/63/228) \r\ngoes a long way in highlighting the importance of \r\ncooperation among the United Nations system, national \r\nparliaments and the IPU. Namibia supports the \r\nconclusions and recommendations contained in the \r\nreport, particularly those related to the circulation of \r\nthe outcome document of the joint United Nations-IPU \r\nannual parliamentary hearing at the United Nations as \r\nan official United Nations document and the allocation \r\nof a separate General Assembly agenda item to explore \r\ncooperation among the United Nations, national \r\nparliaments and the IPU. \r\n As at previous sessions, the General Assembly \r\nwill be requested to adopt the draft resolution on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the IPU. \r\nThe draft resolution will, inter alia, encourage the \r\nUnited Nations and the IPU to continue to cooperate \r\nclosely in various fields — in particular peace and \r\nsecurity, economic and social development, \r\ninternational law, human rights and democracy and \r\ngender issues — bearing in mind the significant \r\nbenefits of such cooperation between the two \r\norganizations. It will also encourage the IPU’s \r\ncontributions to the work of the General Assembly, \r\nincluding the revitalization of the Assembly, United \r\nNations reform and system-wide coherence. Namibia \r\ntrusts that the draft resolution will be adopted by \r\nconsensus. We therefore urge Member States to support \r\nit. \r\n In conclusion, let me take this opportunity to \r\ninform Member States that Namibia will facilitate the \r\nnegotiations on the draft resolution on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU. We would \r\nalso like to take this opportunity to congratulate Italy \r\non a job well done in facilitating a similar draft \r\nresolution in 2006. \r\n Ms. Chen Peijie (China) (spoke in Chinese): It is \r\nincreasingly important that the United Nations, the \r\nworld’s most universal international Organization, \r\nenhance its cooperation with other international and \r\nregional organizations to address the challenges of \r\nglobalization and myriad issues in the international \r\narena. The Chinese delegation welcomes the General \r\nAssembly’s consideration of the important item, \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand other organizations”. On this occasion, I should \r\nlike to make some brief comments on the cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Asian-African \r\nLegal Consultative Organization (AALCO). \r\n AALCO is the only influential intergovernmental \r\norganization that is composed of Asian and African \r\nStates and dedicated to addressing legal issues. \r\nFounded in 1956, it was a major outcome of the \r\nfamous Bandung Conference of 1955. For more than \r\nhalf a century, AALCO has worked consistently to \r\npromote cooperation and exchanges among Asian and \r\nAfrican States in the spirit of unity, friendship and \r\ncooperation advocated at the Bandung Conference. It \r\nassists Asian and African States in the practice of \r\ninternational law and in their efforts to promote the \r\nprogressive development and codification of such law. \r\nComments and proposals made by AALCO on the \r\nrelevant items on the agendas of the Sixth Committee \r\nand the International Law Commission serve as an \r\nimportant frame of reference for Asian and African \r\nStates as they participate in discussions on the relevant \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 16 \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly items and have great reference value \r\nfor the work of other United Nations legal bodies.  \r\n AALCO enjoys good cooperative relations with \r\nthe United Nations and its relevant organs. Over the \r\nyears, AALCO and specialized United Nations \r\nagencies, such as UNESCO, the United Nations Office \r\non Drugs and Crime, the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the International \r\nLaw Commission, have sent representatives to one \r\nanother’s meetings to actively participate in the \r\nconsideration of relevant items. As a result, the \r\ncooperation among those bodies has been continuously \r\nenhanced and broadened.  \r\n Asia and Africa have the largest number of \r\ndeveloping countries and the largest populations in the \r\nworld. Thanks to their efforts over many years, Asian \r\nand African countries have achieved enormous \r\nprogress in the political, economic and social fields. \r\nTheir status and role in international affairs have \r\ngrown markedly, which has made them an important \r\nforce for world peace and shared development. As an \r\nimportant platform for exchange and cooperation, \r\nAALCO will no doubt play an increasingly positive \r\nrole in enhancing the effective participation of Asian \r\nand African States in promoting democratization and \r\nthe rule of law in international relations. \r\n As a State member of both the United Nations \r\nand the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization, \r\nthe Chinese Government has consistently supported \r\nAALCO’s efforts to enhance cooperation and \r\nexchanges with the United Nations. From this rostrum, \r\nI wish to reiterate that the Chinese Government will, as \r\nalways, continue to contribute to enhancing \r\ncooperation among the Asian-African Legal \r\nConsultative Organization, the United Nations and \r\nother relevant organs. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): The \r\nSenegalese delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Uganda, on \r\nbehalf of the States members of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference (OIC), on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the OIC. However, Senegal, in its \r\ncapacity as Chair of the OIC Summit at its eleventh \r\nsession, would like to share with the Assembly some of \r\nour thoughts with regard to that cooperation. \r\n The important role of regional organizations and \r\nothers in dealing with the major issues on the agenda \r\nof the United Nations General Assembly has been \r\nreaffirmed many times since this debate began. In point \r\nof fact, whether it is terrorism, the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict, peacebuilding, human rights or even \r\nhumanitarian action, organizations such as the African \r\nUnion and the Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\nare well-placed to understand the deep-seated causes \r\nand to provide suitable solutions, either because of \r\ntheir knowledge of the region concerned or because of \r\nthe particular membership of the organizations.  \r\n Let me say that it is with the greatest satisfaction \r\nthat Senegal notes the continued strengthening of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, and we \r\nwelcome the attention paid to the important issues on \r\nthe OIC agenda by His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nas well as his presence in Dakar on 13 March 2008 at \r\nthe signing of the peace agreement between Chad and \r\nthe Sudan, which took place on the margins of the OIC \r\nSummit. That is a good illustration of that ongoing \r\nattention. Added to that is the upcoming high-level \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on dialogue here in \r\nNew York under the auspices of His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, which will provide yet another \r\noccasion for those two organizations to strengthen their \r\nlinks. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/63/228) \r\nnotes in section L of its part II that over and above the \r\nrelations between the Secretariat and the OIC, the \r\ncooperation between that organization and the United \r\nNations has also been extended to other agencies and \r\nbodies of the United Nations system, in particular in \r\nthe form of initiatives taken with UNICEF, the World \r\nMeteorological Organization and the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\n We welcome that dynamism, however we also \r\nhope that those various areas of cooperation will go \r\nbeyond simple talks between staff of the respective \r\nprogrammes for each body or agency and actually lead \r\nto effective synergies that will have a specific impact \r\non projects on the ground. \r\n In that respect, the OIC’s contribution to the \r\nWorld Food Programme in November 2007, the first of \r\nits kind, should serve as an example. In that area, \r\nSenegal would like to propose that the United Nations, \r\nthrough its competent departments and services, take \r\nan active role in the implementation of the OIC \r\nprogramme aimed at providing one half of a million \r\ncomputers to poor countries that are members of the \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n17 08-58387 \r\n \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Such a \r\nprogramme, if implemented, would constitute a major \r\ncontribution to the achievement by those countries of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, which are at the \r\nheart of the United Nations priorities. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to stress the fact that \r\nvirtually all of the United Nations interventions in the \r\narea of peace and security and humanitarian action are \r\ncarried out in countries that are also members of the \r\nOIC. That shows that these are two preferred areas for \r\nthe necessary cooperation between those organizations \r\nand, for that reason, Senegal will spare no effort during \r\nits time in office as Chair of the OIC to increase the \r\nnumber of initiatives and joint actions in those two \r\nareas. \r\n Mr. Aligrudić (Serbia): As a State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of \r\nEurope — of whose Parliamentary Assembly I am a \r\nVice-President — Serbia is a staunch supporter of \r\nthose organizations. By furthering their goals — the \r\npreservation and promotion of human rights, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law and supporting political, \r\nlegal and institutional reforms — the Council of \r\nEurope and the OSCE make important contributions to \r\nconflict prevention, confidence-building and the \r\npromotion of peace. Their cooperation with the United \r\nNations is therefore ever so important. \r\n The importance of the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) of the United \r\nNations was emphasized at the third Summit of the \r\nCouncil of Europe in Warsaw in 2005. The MDGs, as \r\nwell as current challenges such as terrorism and other \r\ncrimes, make it incumbent on the United Nations and \r\nthe Council of Europe to intensify their cooperation \r\nand joint approach, drawing upon hitherto experiences \r\nand available resources to deal with those challenges. \r\nThose issues help to bring into focus again the validity \r\nof the Agreement between the Council of Europe and \r\nthe United Nations Secretariat signed in 1951.  \r\n Cooperation in the field of human rights between \r\nthe Council of Europe and the United Nations, as well \r\nas between the Human Rights Commissioners of the \r\ntwo organizations, should be intensified, particularly in \r\nthe context of the establishment of international \r\nstandards and their practical implementation. \r\n Serbia strongly supports the activities of the \r\nCouncil of Europe aimed at promoting respect for \r\nhuman rights, democracy and the rule of law in Kosovo \r\nand Metohija, the Serbian province under interim \r\nUnited Nations administration, as well as the Council’s \r\nactivities, aimed at implementing international \r\nstandards, particularly with respect to members of the \r\nnon-Albanian communities. All those activities, \r\nhowever, must be designed and implemented in strict \r\ncompliance with Security Council resolution 1244 \r\n(1999), which provides the only legal basis for the \r\nactivities of international organizations in Kosovo and \r\nMetohija. \r\n Considering that the United Nations Interim \r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the \r\nCouncil of Europe concluded the Agreement on \r\nTechnical Arrangements in connection with the \r\nCouncil of Europe’s Framework Convention for the \r\nProtection of and National Minorities in August 2004 \r\nand that the first monitoring cycle relating to the \r\nimplementation of the Convention in Kosovo and \r\nMetohija was completed by the adoption of a \r\nresolution by the Committee of Ministers of the \r\nCouncil of Europe on 21 June 2006, it is of vital \r\nimportance to take the appropriate measures contained \r\nin the conclusions and recommendations of the \r\nresolution. It is equally important to proceed with the \r\nprovisions of the letter sent by the Advisory Committee \r\non the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention to \r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General in \r\nKosovo and Metohija of July 2007 and the report to the \r\nCommittee on the implementation of the resolution in \r\nKosovo and Metohija. It is all the more important now, \r\nas no reply to the letter had been received by May \r\n2008, when a new letter was sent. \r\n Following the conclusion of the Technical \r\nAgreement for the implementation of the European \r\nConvention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman \r\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment between the \r\nCouncil of Europe and UNMIK in August 2004 and the \r\nexchange of letters between the Secretary-General of \r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the \r\nSecretary-General of the Council of Europe in 2006, \r\nthe experts of the European Committee for the \r\nPrevention of Torture were given the possibility to visit \r\nall detention and prison units in Kosovo and Metohija \r\nin order to verify whether the provisions of the \r\nConvention were being complied with and whether the \r\ninspection modalities in the NATO detention units were \r\ndefined. And the fact that the first visit of the \r\nCommittee took place in March 2007 provides \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 18 \r\n \r\neloquent proof that the cooperation of international \r\norganizations is needed and is fruitful. \r\n Of exceptional importance to my country are \r\nfield activities related to the restoration of cultural \r\nheritage in Kosovo and Metohija, particularly those \r\nconducted by the Independent International \r\nCommission for Cultural Heritage, established by the \r\nCouncil of Europe, the European Commission and \r\nUNMIK in the wake of the March 2004 riots against \r\nnon-Albanians.  \r\n The three years of activity of the Reconstruction \r\nImplementation Commission with respect to Serbian \r\nsacred places has confirmed the Commission’s \r\nimportance for the successful implementation of \r\ncultural heritage projects and the promotion of \r\ninter-ethnic cooperation and dialogue. Serbia \r\nappreciates very much the fact that the Commission’s \r\nactivities are pursued under the auspices of UNMIK \r\nand in accordance with Security Council resolution \r\n1244 (1999), with the participation of the Serbian \r\nOrthodox Church. Serbia particularly appreciates the \r\nCouncil of Europe’s contribution to the Commission’s \r\nwork and expects the Council to continue to play its \r\ncooperative role. \r\n The question of refugees continues to be an \r\nextremely burdensome problem for Serbia and the \r\nentire region of South-Eastern Europe. In order to find \r\nlasting and sustainable solutions, it is necessary to \r\nintensify cooperation between the United Nations, in \r\nparticular the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE), in order to solve this problem at the regional \r\nlevel, with the full implementation of the Sarajevo \r\nDeclaration.  \r\n Serbia fully supports the continuation of the \r\nactivities of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo and \r\nMetohija within its current mandate, under the auspices \r\nof UNMIK and on the basis of Security Council \r\nresolution 1244 (1999). This means that the activities \r\nof the OSCE Mission in Kosovo must be status-neutral. \r\nIt is of particular importance that that Mission not \r\nfacilitate by its activities the building and functioning \r\nof those institutions created through the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence of the province. Serbia \r\nexpects the OSCE Mission in Kosovo to become \r\nincreasingly engaged in addressing one of the most \r\ncritical issues for Kosovo and Metohija: the security \r\nand status of the non-Albanian ethnic communities \r\nwhich live in very difficult conditions. In that \r\nconnection, it is necessary that, in addition to \r\ndeveloping democratic institutions and the rule of law, \r\nthe OSCE Mission in Kosovo accentuates in its \r\nactivities the improvement of the status of the ethnic \r\ngroups discriminated against. This implies respect for \r\nhuman rights, security, freedom of movement, property \r\nand labour rights, health protection and education. We \r\ncall on the OSCE Mission in Kosovo to devote special \r\nattention to communities living in enclaves and to \r\nsupport the Serbian proposal to establish new \r\nmunicipalities which would reduce the level of \r\nisolation of the population living in the enclaves.  \r\n A comprehensive programme for the sustainable \r\nreturn of internally displaced persons must be drawn \r\nup, to which the OSCE Mission in Kosovo may render \r\na significant contribution through cooperation with \r\ncompetent Serbian institutions and international \r\norganizations. \r\n The OSCE Mission in Kosovo should also \r\nsupport the protection of the property rights and \r\nindividual tenancy rights of the members of ethnic \r\ncommunities discriminated against; ensure property \r\nrestitution and compensation for destroyed or \r\ninaccessible property; and make sure that the rights of \r\nthe State of Serbia to privatized property or property to \r\nbe privatized are respected. There is no doubt that the \r\nrespect and protection of those rights are among the \r\npreconditions for the safe and sustainable return of \r\ninternally displaced persons to their homes.  \r\n The OSCE Mission in Kosovo should invest \r\nadditional efforts in improving the situation of the \r\njudiciary in Kosovo and Metohija. Those efforts would \r\nbe particularly important in establishing an appropriate \r\njudiciary system in those parts of the province whose \r\npopulation refuses to recognize the secessionist \r\nGovernment. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to underline the \r\nquestion of the destiny of missing persons, namely \r\nSerbs and other non-Albanians in Kosovo and \r\nMetohija, particularly in the light of the testimony \r\npublished in the book by Carla Del Ponte, former Chief \r\nProsecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia. I therefore urge UNMIK to do \r\nits utmost to ensure that all cases are properly \r\ninvestigated. \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n19 08-58387 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 44/6 of 17 October 1989, \r\nI now call on the Secretary General of the Council of \r\nEurope, Mr. Terry Davis. \r\n Mr. Davis (Council of Europe): Some people \r\nargue that a world facing economic turmoil and \r\nterrorist threats should have other priorities than \r\nhuman rights. They could not be more wrong. \r\n Recession and terrorism are two very different \r\nthings, but they both cause insecurity and fear. They \r\nboth put a strain on relations among people and among \r\npeoples. It is at times like these that there is an even \r\ngreater need for the values of humanity; a greater need \r\nfor justice, for equality, for solidarity, for tolerance and \r\nfor mutual respect, both among people and among \r\npeoples.  \r\n History has taught us a harsh lesson every time \r\nthis simple truth has been forgotten or ignored. It was \r\nwith that truth in mind that, 60 years ago, this General \r\nAssembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. And it was with this truth in mind that, 60 years \r\nago, a group of European countries established the \r\nCouncil of Europe and, two years later, adopted the \r\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.  \r\n Today, the General Assembly is discussing draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.12, on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe. I hope that \r\nit will receive the broadest possible support. Its content \r\nreflects the work which the Council of Europe is doing \r\nto protect, promote and expand in Europe the values \r\nand ideals which are common to us all. In our \r\nendeavour, the United Nations is a most important and \r\nvaluable partner. Our cooperation is continuous, close, \r\nwide-ranging, specific and meaningful.  \r\n The draft resolution contains a more detailed \r\ndescription of where our cooperation stands today and \r\nwhere we would like to take it tomorrow. It refers to \r\nour activities, standards, achievements and objectives, \r\nabout all of which we feel very strongly. Some are \r\nuniversally accepted; others, less so. But they were \r\nincluded to inspire dialogue, not to dictate.  \r\n One omission from the draft resolution is a \r\nreference to the abolition of the death penalty. At the \r\nCouncil of Europe, we regard the death penalty as one \r\nof the most inhumane and degrading forms of \r\npunishment. Only one country in Europe, in fact the \r\nonly European country which is not a member of the \r\nCouncil of Europe, still uses the death penalty and we \r\nlook forward to its abolition there as well.  \r\n This is a good illustration of the fact that Europe \r\nis not alone. We know that we are part of the majority \r\nhere in the United Nations General Assembly. That \r\nmakes my final point for me: the Council of Europe \r\ndoes not presume to lecture or to impose its ideas and \r\nvalues on the rest of the world; that was the old \r\nimperialist attitude of Europe. Today we recognize that \r\nwe are only one part of the world. We are proud of our \r\nvalues but we are not too proud to admit that we can \r\nlearn from other continents. We want to work together \r\nwith the rest of the world to define our common values \r\nand translate them into reality. In short, we want to \r\nwork together with the United Nations to change the \r\nworld. I hope for the Assembly’s support. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 33/18 of 10 November \r\n1978 and General Assembly decision 53/453 of \r\n18 December 1998, I now call on the permanent \r\nobserver of the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie. \r\n Mr. Camara (International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie) (spoke in French): As this is the first \r\ntime that I have taken the floor, I should like, on behalf \r\nof Mr. Abdou Diouf, Secretary-General of the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie (OIF), \r\nand on my own behalf, to congratulate the President of \r\nthe General Assembly and the other Assembly officers \r\non the trust placed in them to lead the work of the \r\nsixty-third session. The Secretary-General of the OIF \r\nalso requested that I commend His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon for his excellent relationship with the OIF, for \r\nthe quality of his report (A/63/228) and for his constant \r\navailability. Indeed, the two Secretaries-General have \r\nmet three times in less than two years, which attests to \r\nthe excellent relations between the two organizations.  \r\n I thank the Group of Francophone Ambassadors, \r\nwho, since the moment that I arrived, have made me \r\nfeel welcome and have given me all the individual and \r\ncollective support that an organization can expect from \r\nits members. In particular, I congratulate the \r\nrepresentatives of Latvia and the Kingdom of Thailand, \r\nwhich recently joined the OIF. On behalf of the OIF \r\nSecretary-General, I assure them that they will find \r\nfriendship and solidarity there.  \r\n Because of the comprehensiveness of the report \r\nof the Secretary-General (A/63/228) regarding \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 20 \r\n \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIF, I \r\nneed not list the significant results achieved in that area \r\nover the past two years. As members will have noted in \r\nthe report, the OIF’s activities seek to strengthen the \r\npillars of the United Nations: security, development \r\nand human rights.  \r\n I should like to quickly emphasize the areas in \r\nwhich the OIF would particularly like to highlight its \r\ncooperation with the United Nations in the coming \r\nyears: consolidating activities related to early warning, \r\npreventive diplomacy and the OIF’s mediation at a \r\nseminar following up on the Paris meeting, which was \r\nmentioned this morning; further strengthening the \r\npeacekeeping capacities of French-speaking States and \r\nencouraging them to contribute military contingents \r\nthat include police and civilian components; increasing \r\nelectoral assistance and monitoring to consolidate the \r\nrule of law and assist democratic transitions; and \r\npromoting swifter ratification of major international \r\ninstruments, in particular the Convention on the \r\nProtection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural \r\nExpressions and the Optional Protocols to the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, which has been \r\nratified by all French-speaking countries and whose \r\ntwentieth anniversary will be commemorated in 2009. \r\n The OIF regrets the fact that the francophone \r\ncommunity is affected by several crisis situations. We \r\nare convinced of the added value of our organization \r\nand its ability to make a specific contribution to the \r\nresolution of those crises in accordance, of course, with \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, international law \r\nand the sovereignty of States.  \r\n Therefore, in close cooperation with the United \r\nNations, the OIF will strive to increase its efforts to \r\npromote the rule of law and the restoration of \r\nconstitutional order whenever necessary, in conformity \r\nwith the Bamako Declaration; to promote \r\nimplementation of the Ouagadougou Political \r\nAgreement as well as stability in Chad, the Great \r\nLakes region, Lebanon and Haiti; and to assist the \r\ninclusive political dialogue process in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. \r\n The OIF participates actively in the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission within its country-specific \r\nconfigurations for Burundi, the Central African \r\nRepublic and Guinea-Bissau. Here, we commend the \r\nrespective Chairs of those configurations and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office.  \r\n The Quebec summit, which was, as recalled \r\nearlier, the first North-South forum of heads of State or \r\nGovernment to meet following the outbreak of the \r\nfinancial crisis, called for reform of the international \r\nfinancial system through efforts to find sustainable and \r\nviable solutions within inclusive forums, taking into \r\naccount the concerns and sensitivities felt in all regions \r\nthroughout the world. In that regard, the OIF \r\ncommends the initiative of the President of the General \r\nAssembly to establish an expert group to express \r\nindependent views in relevant forums. The OIF hopes \r\nthat French-speaking experts will be more closely \r\ninvolved in seeking solutions to that terrible crisis. \r\n Given the seriousness of environmental \r\nchallenges and climate change, the OIF reaffirms its \r\nsupport for the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change and for the implementation of the \r\nKyoto Protocol and the Bali Road Map. We are \r\nworking towards the common goal of at least a  \r\n50 per cent reduction in global greenhouse gas \r\nemissions by 2050 and are continuing, within the \r\nframework of the negotiations under United Nations \r\nauspices, to seek a global consensus on concrete \r\nobjectives more closely aligned with the scenarios \r\nformulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange. \r\n Based on the shared values of peace, democracy, \r\nthe rule of law and human rights, as well as the sharing \r\nof the French language, the OIF is particularly \r\nsensitive to respect for the status of languages. That \r\ndemand and that vigilance, which we share with all \r\nother linguistic groups, is reflected in the \r\nimplementation of resolution 61/266, on \r\nmultilingualism, which is understood as achieving \r\nparity among the six official languages of the \r\nOrganization and between the two working languages \r\nof the Secretariat. The twofold commemoration of the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and of the International Year of \r\nLanguages highlights all the meaning and importance \r\nof that principle. \r\n The Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, has \r\nalready shown the way forward. Within a very short \r\nperiod of time, by virtue of his personal commitment \r\nand political resolve, he has made statements that have \r\ntaken into account the reality of diversity. Can the \r\nSecretary-General’s example be followed and \r\nstrengthened to serve the peoples of the United \r\nNations?  \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n21 08-58387 \r\n \r\n In addition to his personal commitment, the \r\nSecretary-General followed up on one of the General \r\nAssembly’s recommendations by appointing \r\nMr. Kiyotaka Akasaka, Under-Secretary-General for \r\nCommunications and Public Information, as \r\nCoordinator for Multilingualism to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations as a forum to set a global agenda. The \r\nOIF congratulates Mr. Akasaka and assures him of its \r\navailability and support. Promoting diversity illustrates \r\nthe old adage: instead of being right alone, let us be \r\nright together; let us prefer being right collectively to \r\nbeing right individually.  \r\n The women and men who, in the silence of \r\nbooths and behind computer keyboards, are busy \r\nmanipulating countless documents — those without \r\nwhom conferences and seminars would be monotonous \r\nand monolingual and who work tirelessly to enable us \r\nto understand and listen to one another — those women \r\nand men, the translators, interpreters, editors, \r\nproofreaders and supervisors of the language and \r\nconference services of the United Nations system, who \r\nrestore to the world its plural identity and linguistic \r\ndiversity, deserve our undivided attention and full \r\nconsideration. On behalf of the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophone, I salute them.  \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 35/2 of 13 October 1980, \r\nI now call on the observer for the Asian-African Legal \r\nConsultative Organization. \r\n Mr. Narinder Singh (Asian-African Legal \r\nConsultative Organization): It is my privilege and \r\nhonour, on behalf of the Asian-African Legal \r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO) and in my \r\ncapacity as President of the forty-seventh session of \r\nAALCO, to address this Assembly, the most \r\nrepresentative and democratic forum of the world. \r\n I extend my sincere congratulations to the \r\nAssembly President and to his colleagues in the Bureau \r\non their elections to those high offices. We are \r\nconfident that, with his wisdom and experience, he will \r\nsteer the session to a very successful outcome. \r\n The Asian-African Legal Consultative \r\nOrganization was one of the tangible outcomes of the \r\nhistoric Bandung Conference, which took place in \r\n1955. It linked together States of the Asian and African \r\nregions, sending a message to the world that whatever \r\nmay be the differences in our political, economic or \r\nlegal systems, we are inextricably linked together as an \r\nAsian-African identity. That message of Bandung has \r\nhad a lasting appeal, which for years has brought \r\nAsian-African countries together in various world \r\nforums. \r\n AALCO has been promoting Asian-African \r\ncooperation on legal matters during the 52 years of its \r\nexistence. The organization was originally founded by \r\nseven States and has grown over time to comprise \r\n47 member States and two observers. We look forward \r\nto enlarging our membership even further, so that we \r\nmay become more representative and better promote \r\nthe views and concerns of the member States of the \r\nregion. I take this opportunity to call upon other \r\ncountries from Asia and Africa to consider becoming \r\nmembers of AALCO. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome document \r\n(resolution 60/1) acknowledged that many of today’s \r\nthreats recognize no national boundaries, are \r\ninterlinked and must be tackled at the global, regional \r\nand national levels in accordance with the Charter and \r\ninternational law, and that regional and other \r\norganizations can play a key role in helping the United \r\nNations face those global challenges. Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \r\nshould seek to capitalize on the strength of each \r\norganization and should be complementary.  \r\n AALCO complements the work of the United \r\nNations in the progressive development and \r\ncodification of international law. AALCO provides an \r\nopportunity to a large number of Asian and African \r\ncountries to contribute actively to the strengthening of \r\nthe rule of law in international relations. It has \r\nundertaken various studies on international legal issues \r\nof common concern and has, in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations, played a significant role in \r\nharmonizing the positions of Asian and African \r\ncountries in the legal area. \r\n AALCO held its forty-sixth and forty-seventh \r\nannual sessions in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2007 \r\nand New Delhi, India, in 2008, respectively, and during \r\nthose sessions a number of items on our agenda \r\ncomplemented the work of the United Nations. At both \r\nthose sessions, we considered the work of the \r\nInternational Law Commission, the law of the sea, the \r\nstatus and treatment of refugees, cooperation against \r\ntrafficking in women and children, human rights, \r\nterrorism, the environment and the United Nations \r\nConvention against Corruption. At the Cape Town \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 22 \r\n \r\nsession, we focused special attention on the ongoing \r\nDoha Round of trade negotiations and on international \r\ncooperation in countering terrorism, while at the New \r\nDelhi session, the topic for special consideration was \r\nissues in international humanitarian law. \r\n The forty-seventh session of AALCO gave rise to \r\nmandates that are pertinent to the work of the United \r\nNations. For example, the secretariat has been asked to \r\nconduct a study to find durable solutions to refugee \r\nproblems. On international terrorism, the AALCO \r\nSecretary-General is exploring the possibility of \r\nholding a workshop in cooperation with the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime to deal with legal \r\naspects of countering terrorism. The secretariat is \r\nconsidering preparing model legislation to implement \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Corruption of \r\n2003, while the work on model legislation against \r\ntrafficking in persons, especially women and children, \r\nis well on its way to completion.  \r\n The topic of climate change was a priority issue \r\nat our most recent session, and the secretariat has been \r\nmandated to follow up on the ongoing negotiations for \r\nan international agreement on stronger action on \r\nclimate change for the period beyond 2012, as laid \r\ndown in the Bali Action Plan. In addition, AALCO will \r\nhold a one-day seminar entitled “Sixty Years of the \r\nInternational Law Commission” in New Delhi on \r\n2 December 2008. The wide range of topics on \r\nAALCO’s agenda clearly illustrates the capacity of the \r\norganization to contribute positively to collective \r\nefforts aimed at tackling the new challenges facing the \r\ninternational community. \r\n In order to assist in the teaching, study, \r\ndissemination and wider appreciation of international \r\nlaw in the Asian-African region, AALCO has launched \r\nan annual training programme on general international \r\nlaw, whose first session will run from 3 to  \r\n14 November 2008 at its headquarters in New Delhi. \r\nWe hope to strengthen that programme further with the \r\nsupport of the relevant United Nations bodies, such as \r\nthe United Nations University and the United Nations \r\nInstitute for Training and Research, with which we are \r\nworking closely. \r\n We need to mobilize all our resources to address \r\nthe tremendous global challenges facing humankind. \r\nUndoubtedly, strengthening cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations is a key \r\nelement in that respect. Expanding relations between \r\nthe United Nations and AALCO could also serve that \r\nobjective and contribute to fulfilling the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations. \r\n In conclusion, may I express our hope and \r\nexpectation for enhanced future cooperation between \r\nour two organizations in all areas of common concern \r\nand in the best interests of our Member States. Finally, \r\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report (A/63/228) on the subject. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/32 of 19 November \r\n2002, I now call on the Secretary General of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union, His Excellency Mr. Anders \r\nJohnsson.  \r\n Mr. Johnsson (Inter-Parliamentary Union): Last \r\nmonth, Sir, one of the predecessors of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly and today the Speaker of the \r\nParliament of Namibia, Dr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, was \r\nelected President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\n(IPU). He has asked me to deliver these remarks on his \r\nand the IPU’s behalf and to assure the President that he \r\nlooks forward to working very closely with him in \r\nstrengthening cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n As the latest report (A/63/228) of the United \r\nNations Secretary-General amply attests, cooperation \r\nbetween our two organizations over the past two years \r\nhas been substantive and widespread. It has covered \r\ninternational peace and security, development, finance \r\nand trade, democracy, gender and human rights. \r\n I do not propose to dwell on the details of this \r\nbroad agenda, but I would like to highlight a few points \r\nof particular relevance for our future work together. \r\nTwo years ago the General Assembly adopted an \r\nambitious resolution (resolution 61/6) on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion (IPU) which welcomed the efforts, then under \r\nway, for a greater parliamentary contribution to the \r\nwork of the United Nations. It urged the IPU to play an \r\nactive role in relation to the newly established United \r\nNations bodies, in particular the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, the Development Cooperation Forum and \r\nthe Human Rights Council. I am pleased to report that \r\ngood progress is being made on all of these fronts. \r\n Since then, the IPU has been working closely \r\nwith the Peacebuilding Commission, based on the \r\ncommon understanding that a key prerequisite for \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n23 08-58387 \r\n \r\nlasting peace is the establishment of strong institutions \r\nof good governance. From this perspective, the \r\ninstitution of parliament, as a forum for national \r\nreconciliation where political parties from the majority \r\nand opposition can forge a consensus on national \r\ndevelopment objectives, requires particular attention. \r\nThe IPU will continue to work with the Commission, \r\nwith a view to more fully engaging national \r\nparliaments in the countries under consideration by the \r\nCommission in efforts to promote democratic \r\ngovernance, national dialogue and reconciliation. At \r\nthe risk of stating the obvious, I will add that \r\ndemocracy will not flourish in a country where the \r\nparliament is neglected. \r\n The IPU is also closely following the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, particularly as it relates to the \r\nuniversal periodic review of the fulfilment of human \r\nrights obligations and commitments by United Nations \r\nMember States. As I speak here today, members of \r\nparliamentary human rights bodies are meeting at IPU \r\nheadquarters in Geneva for discussions with the \r\nCouncil and the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights to develop a programme of action for \r\nparliamentary participation in the review. This is part \r\nof our work to secure deeper involvement by \r\nparliaments everywhere in the international human \r\nrights monitoring and follow-up mechanisms. It means \r\ninvolving members of parliament at an early stage \r\nwhen the periodic country reports to be submitted to \r\nthe United Nations are being drafted. It involves \r\nsubmitting the conclusions and recommendations that \r\nemanate from those main monitoring bodies to \r\nparliament for further consideration and action by \r\nthem, and it involves consolidating the oversight \r\nfunction of parliament as it relates to the \r\nimplementation of international commitments. \r\n As far as the Economic and Social Council \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum is concerned, the \r\nIPU has played a part in shaping its agenda and \r\nworking procedures. In June we convened the \r\nparliamentary segment of a Stakeholder Forum on the \r\nrole of national and local stakeholders in contributing \r\nto aid quality and effectiveness. Its report was \r\nintroduced to the Development Cooperation Forum at \r\nits first substantive session here in New York this July, \r\nand it helped influence the outcome of the third High-\r\nLevel Forum on Aid Effectiveness. Indeed, the Accra \r\nAgenda for Action speaks clearly about the \r\nresponsibility of parliaments to help design national \r\ndevelopment plans, ensuring greater transparency in \r\npublic financial management and overseeing sound \r\nmutual assessment reviews. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report offers many \r\nexamples of the IPU helping to mobilize parliaments in \r\nsupport of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). The newly elected IPU President, who, as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, presided over the \r\ndrafting of the Millennium Declaration, is committed \r\nto redoubling that effort. Under his leadership, the IPU \r\nwill also pursue the parliamentary campaign that it \r\nlaunched last year to build political momentum in \r\nsupport of the current negotiations to address climate \r\nchange. \r\n General Assembly resolution 61/6 also called for \r\nthe development, as joint United Nations-\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union events, of the annual \r\nparliamentary hearing at the United Nations and other \r\nspecialized parliamentary meetings in the context of \r\nmajor United Nations conferences. Each year we hold a \r\nparliamentary meeting during the annual session of the \r\nCommission on the Status of Women, seeking to \r\nmobilize parliamentary action on the main issue under \r\nconsideration by the Commission. This year’s high-\r\nlevel meeting on HIV/AIDS was accompanied by an \r\nIPU-United Nations Development Programme-\r\nUNAIDS organized parliamentary meeting that yielded \r\nsome very practical policy recommendations for \r\nparliaments. This is the second year that the annual \r\nparliamentary hearing at the United Nations will be \r\nconvened jointly by the President of the United \r\nNations General Assembly and the President of the \r\nIPU. One of the subjects on our agenda for the hearing \r\nthis November is the responsibility to protect, on which \r\nwe expect a lively and constructive exchange of views. \r\nThe United Nations Secretary-General recommends, in \r\nhis report, that the report of this hearing be circulated \r\nas an official United Nations document, a proposal \r\nwith which, needless to say, the IPU concurs. We very \r\nmuch hope that we can rely on your support as well. \r\n Last week the President convened an interactive \r\npanel discussion for the General Assembly on the \r\nsubject of the global financial crisis. Two weeks \r\nearlier, members of the 154 parliaments represented in \r\nthe IPU held a similar debate on the occasion of the \r\n119th IPU Assembly. The resolution they adopted on \r\nthat occasion calls for a truly global and multilateral \r\nresponse to a crisis that extends far beyond the world \r\nof finance. The resolution refers repeatedly to the need \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 24 \r\n \r\nto ensure justice, transparency and accountability. It \r\ncalls on parliaments to make sure that safeguards are in \r\nplace to avoid the emergence of similar crises in the \r\nfuture and, more generally, it invites parliaments to \r\nexercise greater democratic oversight of finance and \r\nthe economy. The resolution also exhorts Governments \r\nto remain vigilant, notwithstanding the crisis, in \r\nmeeting international commitments to implement the \r\nMDGs and similar internationally agreed development \r\ngoals. It concludes by giving us a mandate to organize, \r\nas soon as possible, a global parliamentary conference \r\nto examine the causes of the crisis and to suggest \r\navenues for dealing with its consequences. We very \r\nmuch hope to be able to count on your support and \r\ncooperation when we carry this proposal forward. \r\n When the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session took up office, he singled out \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations as one of the \r\nmain themes for consideration by the General \r\nAssembly in the year ahead. We can only welcome his \r\ndecision, as it is a theme to which the IPU itself has \r\nbeen paying considerable attention. \r\n Two years ago, when we last addressed the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the question of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU, the second \r\nWorld Conference of Speakers of Parliament had \r\nrecently taken place here at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters in this very Hall. The parliamentary \r\nleaders then issued a political declaration entitled \r\n“Bridging the democracy gap in international relations: \r\nA stronger role for parliaments”. They expressed \r\nsupport for United Nations reform, including the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and a more \r\nrepresentative Security Council, and they gave voice to \r\nthe need to make the United Nations more democratic \r\nand accountable to the people it serves throughout the \r\nworld. They suggested that cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations, national parliaments and the IPU \r\nneeded to be significantly strengthened and developed \r\ninto a strategic partnership for that to happen. \r\n As the Secretary-General’s report suggests, this \r\nagenda can be advanced through a regular exchange \r\nbetween the United Nations System Chief Executives \r\nBoard for Coordination and the senior leadership of the \r\nIPU, with a view to building greater coherence in the \r\nwork of the two organizations. However, it also needs \r\nto be placed at the forefront of deliberations here at the \r\nUnited Nations. The IPU is ready to engage in such a \r\ndiscussion, and we invite the General Assembly to join \r\nus. In his report, the Secretary-General suggests that \r\nthe Assembly may wish to devote a specific agenda \r\nitem to this issue. We trust that Member States will be \r\nready to support this proposal. It would be one \r\nimportant way in which the Assembly can advance its \r\nagenda of democratizing the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 54/5 of 8 October 1999, I \r\nnow call on His Excellency Mr. Leonidas \r\nChrysanthopoulos, Secretary General of the Black Sea \r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization. \r\n Mr. Chrysanthopoulos (Black Sea Economic \r\nCooperation Organization): The foundations of the \r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization \r\n(BSEC) were laid down in 1992 as a political initiative \r\nfor economic cooperation in the wake of tremendous \r\nchanges that had taken place in the world. It was a \r\nperiod following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The \r\nfounding fathers of BSEC wanted to create an \r\norganization that could promote peace and stability in \r\nthe Black Sea region through prosperity. \r\n In those 16 years, BSEC has become a forum for \r\ndiscussion and cooperation in a wide range of areas, \r\nnamely, energy, transport, trade and economic \r\ndevelopment, small and medium-sized enterprises, \r\nenvironment, tourism, culture, education, science and \r\ntechnology, telecommunications, pharmaceutics, \r\nagriculture, emergency relief and elimination of the \r\nconsequences of natural and human-made disasters, as \r\nwell as combating organized crime and terrorism. \r\n Furthermore, BSEC has built a permanent and \r\nextensive institutional framework of cooperation that \r\ncovers all levels of governance. BSEC has also \r\nelaborated binding agreements and common action \r\nplans on key issues of regional cooperation. The \r\nAgreement on Combating Organized Crime and its \r\nprotocols, the agreements on cooperation in emergency \r\nsituations and the agreements on simplification of visa \r\nprocedures for business-people and for professional \r\nlorry driver nationals are some examples. \r\n Today, BSEC is in the process of implementing \r\nregional projects of major significance for the Black \r\nSea region, as well as for the Eurasian region. These \r\ninclude the Black Sea Ring Highway project and the \r\nproject on the development of the motorways of the sea \r\nin the BSEC region. The memoranda of understanding \r\nrelated to those projects were signed in 2007. The two \r\nprojects pertain to the development of transport links in \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n25 08-58387 \r\n \r\nthe region. They are expected to do much to foster \r\nintra-BSEC trade, as well as tourism, infrastructure, \r\ntransport investments and economic prosperity among \r\nthe countries of the Black Sea. Most importantly, they \r\nwill make a concrete positive difference in the lives of \r\nthe people of the region and bring them closer \r\ntogether — which should be an objective of all \r\ninternational and regional organizations. \r\n The Black Sea Ring Highway project envisages a \r\nfour-lane ring highway system, approximately \r\n7,100 kilometres long, to connect BSEC member States \r\nwith one another. The project on the development of \r\nthe motorways of the sea in the BSEC region concerns \r\nstrengthening the maritime links among the ports of \r\nBSEC member States. That project will make the Black \r\nSea smaller by creating the necessary infrastructure for \r\nbetter connecting the Black Sea ports and the Black \r\nSea with the Mediterranean and the Caspian Seas. \r\n At its fifty-fourth session, the General Assembly, \r\nby its resolution 54/5 of 8 October 1999, granted \r\nobserver status to the Black Sea Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization. Subsequently, General Assembly \r\nresolution 55/211 of 20 December 2000, on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Black \r\nSea Economic Cooperation Organization, opened up \r\nnew avenues for BSEC to develop working \r\nrelationships with other organizations within the \r\nUnited Nations system and beyond. \r\n Since then, BSEC has signed cooperation \r\nagreements with the United Nations Economic \r\nCommission for Europe, the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme, the United Nations Industrial \r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO) and the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP). BSEC has \r\nalso developed cooperation with the United Nations \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization, the World Trade \r\nOrganization, the World Bank, the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM). \r\n I wish to give a brief summary of the \r\ndevelopment of relations between BSEC and the \r\nspecialized agencies and other organizations and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system during the \r\n2007-2008 period. Within the framework of our \r\ncooperation with UNDP, the Black Sea Trade and \r\nInvestment Promotion Programme (BSTIP) was \r\nlaunched in December 2006. BSTIP is the first \r\npartnership project between UNDP and BSEC and the \r\nfirst programme jointly financed by Turkey and Greece \r\nunder the auspices of UNDP. \r\n The overall aim of the Programme is to support \r\neconomic growth and development in the Black Sea \r\nsubregion through closer economic integration and to \r\nexpand intraregional trade and investment links among \r\nBSEC member States. BSTIP is expected to have a \r\npositive impact on the reduction of poverty as well. \r\nNew partnerships will be developed with business \r\nsupport organizations. The beneficiaries of BSTIP are \r\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises and special \r\nemphasis is given to enterprises managed by young and \r\nwomen entrepreneurs. The Programme is being \r\nimplemented in cooperation with local chambers of \r\ncommerce and business support organizations in each \r\nof the BSEC countries. \r\n As far as our cooperation with UNODC is \r\nconcerned, the first joint BSEC-UNODC project has \r\njust recently been completed. The BSEC Regional \r\nAction Plan for Strengthening the Criminal Justice \r\nResponse to Trafficking in Persons in the Black Sea \r\nRegion is a concrete product of that cooperation. That \r\nBSEC Regional Action Plan aims at promoting \r\nexpertise and best practices exchange as well as \r\nenhancing cooperation among BSEC member States in \r\ncombating human trafficking. Along with its policy \r\ndevelopment and capacity-building aspects, the Action \r\nPlan gives special consideration to three basic elements \r\nin fighting human trafficking, namely, prevention, \r\nprotection and prosecution. \r\n As part of our cooperation with IOM, we recently \r\ncompleted a joint BSEC-IOM project on migration \r\nmanagement. A concrete outcome of that cooperation \r\nwas that the Migration Policy Recommendations for \r\nthe Black Sea Region were developed and adopted by \r\nBSEC. The main purpose of the Recommendations is \r\nto encourage the creation of a framework for BSEC \r\nmember States for sharing expertise and best practices \r\nin migration policies in view of preventing irregular \r\nmigration flows and simultaneously facilitating legal \r\nones. The establishment of cooperation between BSEC \r\nand UNIDO’s International Centre for Hydrogen \r\nEnergy Technology is another positive development.  \r\n I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his factual report on the status of \r\ncooperative relationships between BSEC and various \r\nUnited Nations organizations during 2007 and 2008 \r\n(A/67/228). We appreciate his recommendation that the \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 26 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations, the specialized agencies and other \r\norganizations and programmes of the United Nations \r\nsystem should continue to hold consultations with \r\nBSEC and formulate and implement joint programmes \r\npertaining to fields of common interest. \r\n On 25 June 2007, BSEC celebrated its fifteenth \r\nanniversary with a summit in Istanbul. Almost all \r\nheads of State or Government of BSEC member States \r\nattended. This high level of participation was a \r\nreflection of the political support provided by the \r\nmember States as well as the strong credibility of the \r\norganization. \r\n One of the most important conclusions of the \r\nsummit, which finds its reflection in the summit \r\ndeclaration, concerns the redefinition of the focus and \r\npriorities of BSEC in certain areas of cooperation \r\nwhere we can derive tangible results, such as \r\nenvironmental protection, trade, transport, tourism, \r\nenergy, telecommunications, science and technology \r\nand the fight against all forms of organized crime. \r\n In the declaration, the heads of State and \r\nGovernment of BSEC member States reiterated their \r\ncommitment to contribute to the attainment of the \r\nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals at \r\nnational, regional and global levels and instructed the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of Foreign Affairs to examine \r\npossible steps for the achievement of those goals in the \r\nBSEC region. Within that framework, cooperation is \r\nenvisaged with UNICEF and UNDP. \r\n The consequences of the ongoing global financial \r\ncrisis are of concern to all of us. Measures need to be \r\ntaken by all BSEC member States to safeguard their \r\nfinancial institutions so that economic development in \r\nthe BSEC region is not impeded. The BSEC Working \r\nGroup on Banking and Finance will be convened on \r\n18 November to assess the situation. \r\n This assessment will allow the member States \r\nthat have taken measures to protect their financial \r\ninstitutions to share that information with those \r\nmember States that have not yet been affected at the \r\nsame level by the financial crisis. \r\n The global food crisis is one of the themes in the \r\ndebate at this session of the General Assembly, and it is \r\nalso being addressed by our organization. Within the \r\nBSEC working group on agriculture and agro-industry, \r\nBSEC member States have considered the situation \r\nconcerning the consequences of the increase in food \r\nprices and the actions that may be undertaken in order \r\nto reverse such an increase. Acknowledging that the \r\nincrease in food prices is a worldwide trend that affects \r\nboth developed and developing countries, the working \r\ngroup identified various causes that lead to the \r\nincrease.  \r\n In addition to our efforts to achieve food security, \r\nanother area where BSEC wishes to contribute is the \r\nimprovement of respect, understanding and \r\ncooperation among nations and peoples of different \r\ncultures and religions and to counter the forces that \r\nfuel polarization. We believe that any effort in this \r\ndirection is valuable in promoting sustained peace, \r\nsecurity and stability. It is within this framework that \r\nBSEC has decided to open exploratory contacts with \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations.  \r\n Before concluding, I would like to pay tribute to \r\nthe Republic of Albania, the previous chair-in-office of \r\nBSEC, for drafting and introducing the draft resolution \r\nthat is now before the General Assembly (A/63/L.9). I \r\nalso wish to thank the sponsors of the text and hope it \r\nwill be adopted by consensus. Adoption of this draft \r\nresolution will give new impetus to BSEC’s \r\ncooperation with the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies and others in the pursuit of the objectives and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations as well as those contained in the BSEC charter. \r\nBSEC will continue to play its role with determination \r\nin efforts to strengthen multilateral cooperation to meet \r\nthe global challenges of this millennium. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 477(V) of 1 November \r\n1950, I now call on the Permanent Observer for the \r\nLeague of Arab States.  \r\n Mr. Mahmassani (League of Arab States) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like at the outset to commend \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. I would also like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the report \r\nthat he has presented to this session (A/63/228) on the \r\nclose and multifaceted cooperation between the League \r\nof Arab States and the United Nations in confronting \r\nthe challenges and risks posed to international peace \r\nand security.  \r\n The League of Arab States and its specialized \r\nagencies are working on continuing and intensifying \r\ntheir various facets of cooperation with the United \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n27 08-58387 \r\n \r\nNations, as set forth in the Secretary-General’s report. \r\nThe most recent meeting between representatives of \r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States took \r\nplace in Geneva in early July 2008 and covered several \r\npolitical issues. It also discussed and proposed joint \r\nprojects in the economic, environmental, social, \r\nhumanitarian, cultural and technical fields, as well as \r\nin the area of capacity-building. In addition, \r\nparticipants agreed to form a mechanism to follow up \r\nUnited Nations and Arab League resolutions; bolster \r\ninstitutional ties between their two secretariats so as to \r\nexchange experience, expertise and lessons learned; \r\nand raise the level of joint efforts for conflict \r\nprevention. \r\n The United Nations Secretary-General has \r\nsupported the Arab League’s initiative and proposals to \r\nend the political crisis in Lebanon. Cooperation \r\nbetween the two organizations over the Iraqi issue has \r\nprimarily focused on establishing and activating an \r\nexpanded regional dialogue that was initiated in Sharm \r\nel-Sheikh in 2007. The Arab League has also \r\ncooperated closely with the United Nations on the \r\nlaunching and implementation of the International \r\nCompact with Iraq. This cooperation involves several \r\njoint undertakings, including projects in the fields of \r\ncommerce, investment, finance, agriculture, water, \r\nsustainable development and the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \r\n In the field of industrial development, the United \r\nNations Industrial Development Organization has been \r\ncooperating with the Arab Industrial Development and \r\nMining Organization and the Arab League Educational, \r\nCultural and Scientific Organization. Projects related to \r\nthe environment have included implementation of the \r\nsustainable development initiative in the Arab region, \r\nas well as efforts to implement resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme and the \r\nGlobal Ministerial Environment Forum.  \r\n In addition, the Department of Economic and \r\nSocial Affairs (DESA), together with the Arab League, \r\nhas implemented a special capacity-building project in \r\nthe field of evaluating development strategies aimed at \r\nachieving the MDGs in the Arab region. Last March, \r\nDESA, working in collaboration with the Western Asia \r\nregional office of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP) and the Arab League, organized, \r\nin Abu Dhabi the first Round Table Meeting of Experts \r\non Sustainable Consumption and Production in the \r\nArab Region. Participants stressed the importance of \r\ncooperation between the two organizations and the \r\nneed to build confidence in the dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, as well as bolster their alliance and \r\nmaintain the values of peaceful coexistence and human \r\ndignity.  \r\n In this context, the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with the Arab \r\nLeague in order to encourage cooperation in various \r\nfields, including an initiative to support human rights, \r\ntolerance and the exchange of new practices, as well as \r\nfinding opportunities to enrich dialogue between \r\ndifferent cultures and religions.  \r\n The Arab League’s efforts to intensify full \r\ncooperation with the United Nations in all fields makes \r\nit eager to continue consultations and discussions in \r\norder to search for all possible ways and means to \r\nguarantee the implementation of all resolutions issued \r\nby the Organization, whether related to disarmament, \r\ncombating terrorism or to the peaceful settlement of \r\nconflict. \r\n The most important priority for the Arab League \r\nis to find a just and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict, in accordance with resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy, the Madrid terms of reference and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. Strengthening cooperation between \r\nthe two organizations will reinforce ongoing efforts to \r\nconfront international dangers and challenges and \r\nmaintain international peace and security. Moreover, it \r\nwould guarantee a Middle East region free of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction, in \r\naccordance with resolutions of international legitimacy.  \r\n Cooperation between the League of Arab States \r\nand the United Nations emanates from a deep-rooted \r\ntraditional Arab culture which calls for tolerance and \r\npeaceful coexistence with others through dialogue \r\namong civilizations. The draft resolution to be \r\npresented to the General Assembly under this agenda \r\nitem, on cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States (A/63/L.20), would \r\nstrengthen the principles of cooperation between the \r\ntwo organizations. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 114 and its \r\nsub-items (a) to (u). \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolutions A/63/L.7, A/63/L.9, A/63/L.10, A/63/L.11, \r\nA/63/L.12 and A/63/L.13. \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 28 \r\n \r\n Draft resolution A/63/L.7 is entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Asian-African \r\nLegal Consultative Organization”. Before proceeding \r\nto take action on the draft resolution, I should like to \r\nannounce that since its introduction the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors: the Congo, Gabon, \r\nSyrian Arab Republic and Mongolia. May I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.7? \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.7 was adopted (resolution \r\n63/10). \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Draft resolution A/63/L.9 \r\nis entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Black Sea Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization”. Before proceeding to take action on the \r\ndraft resolution, I should like to announce that since its \r\nintroduction the following countries have become \r\nsponsors: Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, \r\nGeorgia, Montenegro and Serbia. May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/63/L.9? \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.9 was adopted (resolution \r\n63/11). \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.10 is entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nEconomic System”. Before proceeding to take action \r\non the draft resolution, I should like to announce that \r\nsince its introduction the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors: Belize, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, \r\nCosta Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, \r\nJamaica and Panama. May I take it that the Assembly \r\ndecides to adopt draft resolution A/63/L.10? \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.10 was adopted \r\n(resolution 63/12). \r\n \r\n The Acting President: We shall now turn to draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.11, entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Preparatory Commission \r\nfor the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nOrganization”. \r\n  A recorded vote has been requested. \r\n \r\n  A recorded vote was taken. \r\n \r\nIn favour: \r\n Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, \r\nBelarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBrazil, Brunei Darussalam, Burundi, Cambodia, \r\nChina, Congo, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Egypt, \r\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, \r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran \r\n(Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, \r\nLithuania, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, \r\nMyanmar, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Portugal, \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Romania, Russian \r\nFederation, Rwanda, San Marino, Singapore, \r\nSlovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, \r\nSweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Togo, United \r\nArab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nYemen, Zambia \r\nAgainst: \r\n United States of America \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.11 was adopted by 64 \r\nvotes to 1 (resolution 63/13). \r\n \r\n [Subsequently, the delegations of Chile, Costa \r\nRica, Ecuador, Japan, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Maldives, the \r\nNetherlands, Slovenia, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom \r\nadvised the Secretariat that they had intended to \r\nvote in favour.] \r\n The Acting President: Draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.12 is entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Council of Europe”. Before proceeding \r\nto take action on the draft resolution, I should like to \r\nannounce that since its introduction the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors: Albania, Andorra, \r\nArmenia, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, \r\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, \r\nIreland, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, \r\nRomania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, \r\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.12?  \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.12 was adopted \r\n(resolution 63/14). \r\n \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n29 08-58387 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.13 is entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Eurasian Economic Community”. May \r\nI take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.13? \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.13 was adopted \r\n(resolution 63/15). \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Belarus to speak in explanation of \r\nposition. \r\n Mr. Rachkov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nBelarus welcomes the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.12, on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Council of Europe. In the resolution, the \r\nGeneral Assembly rightly pays tribute to the Council of \r\nEurope for its advancement and protection of human \r\nrights, including for its work on the issue of trafficking \r\nin human beings.  \r\n We are happy to see mention of the entry into \r\nforce of the Council of Europe Convention on Action \r\nagainst Trafficking in Human Beings. However, the list \r\nof parties to that important document and to a number \r\nof other international treaties of the Council of Europe \r\non issues of combating crime is in fact limited to the \r\nmember States of the Council of Europe. Because of \r\nvarious circumstances, not all States that could and \r\nwould wish to make a meaningful contribution to \r\nachieving the goals of the Convention have access to \r\nthe mechanisms of cooperation contained in it. \r\n One means of developing cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe, \r\nespecially in combating human trafficking, would be \r\nfor the United Nations to promote a global plan of \r\naction on that topic. As is the case with the \r\naforementioned Council of Europe Convention on \r\nAction against Trafficking in Human Beings, not all \r\nStates are parties to other international documents in \r\nthe area of combating human trafficking, including the \r\nPalermo Protocol to Prevent Trafficking in Persons, \r\nespecially Women and Children. We believe that a \r\nUnited Nations plan of action to combat human \r\ntrafficking, designed to draw in all Member States, \r\ncould combine valuable experience in the \r\nimplementation of various regional and international \r\ndocuments in that area in a clear and open plan for \r\nmultilateral cooperation, with a genuinely global \r\nnature. \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-items (b), (d), (g), (j), (m) and (t) \r\nof agenda item 114? \r\n  It was so decided. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n114 and its sub-items (a), (c), (e), (f), (h), (i), (k), (l), \r\n(n) to (s) and (u). \r\n The Acting President: Before proceeding to the \r\nnext item on our agenda, I would like to appeal to \r\nthose Member States intending to submit draft \r\nresolutions on the remaining sub-items to do so as soon \r\nas possible. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 59 \r\n \r\nHolocaust remembrance \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/316) \r\n \r\n Ms. Halpern (United States of America): Albert \r\nEinstein once said “The world is a dangerous place to \r\nlive, not because of the people who are evil but \r\nbecause of the people who don’t do anything about it”. \r\nEinstein was referring to the deafening silence that \r\nprevailed throughout the world while the Holocaust — \r\nthe systematic slaughter of innocents by the Nazis — \r\nwas taking place.  \r\n The lessons of the Holocaust are as real in our \r\nday as they were 70 years ago, on the eve of \r\nKristallnacht. In every generation tyrants rise up to test \r\nthe will of the world. They know from studying the rise \r\nof Hitler that it is possible to promise unspeakable acts \r\nof violence and yet not be opposed. They know that the \r\nworld has the capacity to stand by and let evil flourish. \r\nBut they must also know that we too have studied \r\nhistory and that we too have learned lessons from it. \r\nThe passage of resolution 60/7 by the General \r\nAssembly three years ago, on 1 November 2005, is \r\nproof of that. That resolution sets a new course for \r\ninternational action to memorialize the victims of the \r\nHolocaust and to confront the threat of genocide in our \r\nown day. \r\n The United States welcomes the release of the \r\nSecretary-General’s recent report on the United \r\nNations Outreach Programme and is pleased to \r\nacknowledge the excellent work done so far to \r\nimplement the full range of activities called for by \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 30 \r\n \r\nresolution 60/7. The efforts to educate, conduct \r\noutreach and help raise generations free from the bonds \r\nof hatred are much needed and form the basis of the \r\nwork of the United Nations at all levels.  \r\n The Outreach Programme is to be commended for \r\nthe creative platforms it has used in order to reach \r\nacross the broad spectrum of diverse societies, \r\nincluding seminars, briefings and round tables, online \r\neducational curricula, film screenings, exhibits and \r\nconcerts. Such an all-encompassing approach to \r\nHolocaust remembrance will prove to be indispensable \r\nto the education of today’s young people to the dangers \r\ninherent in hatred and bigotry and to the horrors of \r\nwhat humankind is capable of doing to one another.  \r\n The United States is proud to be a committed \r\nparticipant in those Outreach Programme efforts. \r\nAmerican educators, film-makers, musicians, institutes \r\nof higher education, museums and foundations have \r\ncontributed their resources and talents to the success of \r\nthis Programme.  \r\n The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, \r\nfor example, has been an active partner with the United \r\nNations Programme. The United States Holocaust \r\nMemorial Museum has organized training seminars for \r\nUnited Nations information officers serving in the \r\nfield. The work of memorializing the Holocaust and the \r\nprevention of future genocides must be an abiding \r\nconcern for all free nations because the threat in our \r\nown time is very real. \r\n The same underlying issues of State-sponsored \r\nhatred and intolerance which led to the Holocaust are \r\nas dangerous today as they were then. The false and \r\nanti-Semitic libels that flourished in Europe before the \r\nSecond World War now find new audiences throughout \r\nthe world. The dignity and value of each individual \r\nmust be respected and protected in order to prevent \r\nfuture acts of genocide. The Outreach Programme and \r\nall of the countries that have participated to date are to \r\nbe commended for their tireless efforts in spreading \r\nthat message. \r\n Despite the adoption of resolution 60/7, it \r\nremains inexplicable that one of the Member States, \r\nIran, continues to insist upon denying the truth of the \r\nHolocaust. As the United States has stated many times \r\nbefore, to deny the Holocaust is tantamount to \r\napproving the extermination of the Jewish people in \r\nparticular, and to approving genocide in general. That \r\nis unacceptable and unconscionable. \r\n If the denial of the Holocaust does prove \r\nanything, it is that the lessons of that \r\nincomprehensible, tragic event in human history \r\nremain unlearned. It is for that reason that the Outreach \r\nProgramme is especially important. We hope that the \r\nProgramme will continue to expand and provide the \r\nnecessary resources to counter intolerance and hatred \r\nwhile promoting understanding and respect. The \r\nUnited Nations will continue to support that essential \r\nmission. \r\n Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon could not have \r\nbeen more correct in stating that it is not enough to \r\nremember, honour and grieve for the dead. As we do, \r\nwe must also educate, nurture and care for the living. \r\nWe must foster in our children a sense of responsibility \r\nso that they can build societies that protect and \r\npromote the rights of all civilians. \r\n It is a simple truth, an eternal truth and a truth \r\nworth defending against all those who seek to infringe \r\nupon it. For if we do not affirm and protect the right of \r\nevery human being to live in a world free from \r\nbaseless hatred, racism and bigotry, we can never claim \r\nto be an organization of united nations. \r\n Ms. Shalev (Israel): At the outset, please allow \r\nme to thank the President for convening this meeting.  \r\n One week from today, the United Nations will \r\nmark the 70th anniversary of the Kristallnacht \r\npogrom — the Night of Broken Glass — a single night \r\nthat served as a prelude to the Holocaust. On that night, \r\norganized gangs of Nazi rioters and their supporters \r\nrampaged throughout Germany, destroying more than a \r\nthousand synagogues, as well as thousands of Jewish \r\nshops and businesses. In the massive pogrom, Jews \r\nwere murdered and many thousands more were sent to \r\nconcentration camps. \r\n The anniversary we commemorate is one of many \r\nactivities of the Holocaust and the United Nations \r\nOutreach Programme. It has been organized since its \r\ninception, following the adoption in November 2005 of \r\nresolution 60/7, entitled “Holocaust remembrance”.  \r\n The resolution was a historic and universal \r\nachievement that signalled the first acknowledgement \r\nby the United Nations of the tragedy that befell the \r\nJewish people during the years of the Second World \r\nWar. Indeed, other peoples, cultures and nations also \r\nsuffered severely from Nazi atrocities. However, let us \r\nnot forget that no other nation lost such an enormous \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n31 08-58387 \r\n \r\nproportion of its people as did the Jewish people. In the \r\nwords of Elie Weisel, “Not all victims were Jews. But \r\nall Jews were victims”. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report before us \r\n(A/63/316) details the impressive work of the \r\nHolocaust and the United Nations Outreach \r\nProgramme of the Department of Public Information, \r\nunder the leadership of Mr. Kiyo Akasaka and his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Shashi Tharoor. Israel commends \r\ntheir valuable work and dedication and will continue to \r\nsupport and cooperate with Mr. Akasaka and his staff. \r\n The State of Israel and the Jewish people \r\nappreciate the historic resolution unanimously adopted \r\nby the General Assembly three years ago regarding \r\nHolocaust remembrance. Yet the resolution and the \r\nSecretary-General’s report are not ends unto \r\nthemselves. Holocaust remembrance must be a \r\ndynamic and ongoing effort that requires our \r\ncommitment to adapting the lessons of the Nazi \r\ngenocide to evolving threats in our times. \r\n Thus, we cannot ignore the troubling reality that \r\ntoday — more than 60 years after the Holocaust — we \r\nhave heard from this very rostrum a leader of a \r\nMember State who calls for the destruction of another \r\nMember State and denies the historical realities of the \r\nHolocaust. In this Hall, all Member States swore: \r\n“Never again”. It is therefore incumbent upon us not \r\nmerely to condemn such statements, but to act \r\nimmediately and with resolve against a Member State \r\nwhose leaders declare such despicable and dangerous \r\nwords. For in the end, the Nazi Holocaust did not begin \r\nin the gas chambers. That is where it ended. The Nazi \r\nHolocaust began with the dangerous words of men. \r\n Israel wishes to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis work, as detailed in the report, and my delegation \r\ncontinues to offer its assistance to ensure that the \r\nlessons of the Holocaust continue to promote peace, \r\ncoexistence and tolerance. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Humankind recalls the terrible crimes of \r\nNazism with indignation and grief. The bloodiest of \r\nthose crimes was the Holocaust. In my country, we \r\nremember those who fell victim to Nazism, including \r\nthe six million killed in the Holocaust, half of whom \r\nwere citizens of the Soviet Union. \r\n Russia considers the Holocaust to be not only the \r\nnational tragedy of the Jewish people, but a catastrophe \r\nof humankind as a whole. Current and future \r\ngenerations must understand who encouraged that \r\nhorrific crime and who committed it. It is unacceptable \r\nto whitewash the actions of those who participated in \r\nthe crimes of Nazism and were condemned by the \r\nNuremberg trials, first and foremost, the members of \r\nthe Schutzstaffel, the ideologues and executors of the \r\nHolocaust. \r\n Thus we are very worried about the chauvinistic \r\nand pro-Nazi tendencies in certain countries, which \r\npose a threat to democracy and human rights. In \r\ncivilized countries, it must be unacceptable to glorify \r\nthe memory of Fascism’s accomplices — the \r\nlegionaries of the Waffen SS and other collaborators — \r\nwho destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of \r\npeaceful citizens, prisoners of war and concentration \r\ncamp internees. It is also our responsibility to pay \r\ntribute to all the soldiers who died freeing Europe from \r\nFascism and who saved the Jews and other peoples \r\nfrom slavery and complete destruction. Let us not \r\nforget those who freed the prisoners from Auschwitz-\r\nBirkenau, Majdanek, Treblinka and other death camps. \r\n At the same time, we are seeing cynical attempts \r\nto rewrite history around the world. In some countries \r\nthat declare themselves democratic, the days of victory \r\nover fascism are considered days of tragedy. \r\nMemorials to those who fought fascism are \r\ndemolished. Monuments are erected and official \r\ndecorations awarded to those who fought for fascism \r\nduring the war and whose hands are drenched in the \r\nblood of innumerable innocent victims. Furthermore, in \r\nmany States the accomplices of fascism and those who \r\nwere directly responsible for putting Nazism’s racial \r\ntheories into practice are often seen as representatives \r\nof national liberation movements and freedom fighters \r\nfor their countries. Thus, the very concept of such \r\nmovements is desecrated, since they are considered to \r\nbe undertaken in the name of racial purification. We \r\nbelieve that such an approach to be an insult to the \r\nhistoric memory of peoples, especially to those who \r\nfought against fascism.  \r\n The Second World War cost 50 million people \r\ntheir lives. Having overcome the scourge of Nazism, \r\nthe world paid too high a price to have to accept \r\nattempts to revive it 60 years after the war that led to \r\nthe creation of the United Nations. We need to be very \r\nvigilant in the face of attempts to revive the ideology \r\nthat led to the Holocaust and uncompromising in \r\ncombating neo-Nazism and other forms of racism.  \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 32 \r\n \r\n That is why the Russian Federation requested \r\nthat, at this session of the General Assembly, a draft \r\nresolution to be submitted to the Third Committee on \r\nthe inadmissibility of certain practices that contribute \r\nto fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance \r\n(A/C.3/63/L.49). We are convinced that the adoption of \r\nthe draft resolution would contribute to the \r\nconsolidation of international efforts to overcome those \r\nugly phenomena. We call on all States that condemn \r\nthe crimes of Nazism and fascism and pay tribute to its \r\nvictims to support that initiative. \r\n History has severely condemned National \r\nSocialism. The crimes of Nazism and its collapse are a \r\nformidable warning to all those who incite ethnic \r\ntensions and forget the lessons of the Second World \r\nWar. We cannot allow people to suffer again by \r\npermitting the spread and resurgence of chauvinist \r\ndoctrines.  \r\n Mr. Ripert (France) (spoke in French): I am \r\nhonoured to speak on behalf of the European Union, \r\nCroatia, Ukraine, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n The European Union, like the United Nations, \r\narose out of the ruins of the Second World War. At the \r\nheight of the turmoil, the Holocaust covered our entire \r\ncontinent with its ashes. However, far beyond Europe, \r\nit marked consciences and changed our hearts. The \r\nhuman race will never be the same again. \r\n More than 60 years have passed since the \r\nHolocaust. Where the actual tragedy took place, \r\nEuropeans have together patiently built a Union that \r\nhas consolidated peace throughout the continent and \r\nbrought them security and prosperity. United in their \r\ndiversity, Europeans have learned the errors of their \r\nways. They did not build to forget — quite the \r\ncontrary. The memory of the Holocaust was at the core \r\nof their entire reconciliation process. Europe is aware \r\nof its responsibility towards the survivors, their \r\nchildren and grandchildren. All Europeans must know \r\nand remember so that the barbarity that almost swept \r\nthem away will never emerge again.  \r\n Three years ago, the General Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 60/7, which designated 27 January as \r\nInternational Day of Commemoration in memory of the \r\nvictims of the Holocaust. The European Union \r\nwelcomes the adoption of that resolution, which \r\ncommemorates the liberation of the Nazi camps and \r\nhonours the memory of Holocaust victims, first and \r\nforemost the millions of Jewish victims — men, \r\nwomen and children — but also the Roma, \r\nhomosexuals, political prisoners or prisoners of war, \r\nand the physically and mentally handicapped. \r\n Commemorating Holocaust victims is an integral \r\npart of our common heritage. It demonstrates our \r\ncommitment to doing our utmost to counter the very \r\nidea that the worst might happen again. Unfortunately, \r\nas we have seen in the past, that lesson is still being \r\nrejected, denied or scorned in various parts of the \r\nworld. Even today, as the United Nations meets once \r\nagain to reaffirm its condemnation of the Holocaust \r\nand to perpetuate the memory of its victims, some have \r\ncast doubts in that regard or even deny it ever \r\noccurred. \r\n That is why the Assembly requested that the \r\nSecretary-General establish an outreach programme on \r\nthe theme “The Holocaust and the United Nations” and \r\ntake measures to encourage civil society to mobilize \r\nthroughout the world. The European Union welcomes \r\nthe programme and the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/63/316), which underscores its successful \r\nimplementation since its establishment in January \r\n2006. The programme facilitated the creation of an \r\ninternational network of groups from civil society, \r\nworld-renowned institutions and Holocaust experts to \r\ndevelop as efficient and comprehensive an outreach \r\nprogramme as possible. \r\n By providing civil society with communication \r\ntools to keep the memory of victims alive, the \r\nprogramme is contributing to the fight against \r\nforgetting or denying the Holocaust. As there are \r\nincreasingly fewer Holocaust survivors who can still \r\nbear witness to it, it is essential that we find new ways \r\nto keep the memories of those horrendous crimes alive \r\nfor future generations. \r\n As the President of the Republic of France said at \r\nAuschwitz at the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation \r\nof the camps in 2005,  \r\n “To honour their memory, to honour the \r\nmemory of all those deportees who died \r\ntragically in this place of suffering and Nazi \r\nextermination: that is the duty of all peoples who \r\nrefuse to accept that the insult of oblivion should \r\nbe added to this betrayal of human values … \r\nWhen we remember each and every one of them, \r\nwe give them justice. We prevail over their \r\nexecutioners, who promised them oblivion.”  \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n33 08-58387 \r\n \r\n The purpose of adopting a resolution on \r\nHolocaust denial (61/255) last year was to confront the \r\ndangers of ignorance and scorn. The Holocaust has a \r\nspecific universal character that cannot be denied or \r\nundermined. By commemorating the Holocaust, we \r\nreaffirm our commitment to fighting anti-Semitism, \r\nracism, hatred and all forms of religious, political or \r\nethnic intolerance. For all those reasons, in 2005 the \r\nEuropean Union supported declaring an International \r\nDay of Commemoration in memory of the victims of \r\nthe Holocaust and establishing a specific United \r\nNations outreach programme.  \r\n Members of the Assembly can rest assured that \r\nthe people of Europe, united in the memory of the \r\nhorror and in their desire to promote peace and \r\nsolidarity among all peoples, will continue to act \r\ntogether to repel any temptation to forget and the \r\ndangers of disavowal. That is our honour and our duty \r\nas a free people. \r\n Mr. Pfanzelter (Austria): Austria fully aligns \r\nitself with the statement which has just been made by \r\nthe Ambassador of France on behalf of the European \r\nUnion.  \r\n We thank the Secretary-General for his excellent \r\nand comprehensive report (A/63/316) on the \r\nprogramme of outreach on the Holocaust and the \r\nUnited Nations. The report shows that Member States \r\nall over the world have benefited from the outreach \r\nprogramme since the adoption of resolution 60/7 in \r\n2005. The resolution also urges Member States to \r\ndevelop educational programmes that will inculcate \r\nfuture generations with the lessons of the Holocaust in \r\norder to help prevent future acts of genocide and, in \r\nthat context, specifically mentions the Task Force for \r\nInternational Cooperation on Holocaust Education, \r\nRemembrance and Research. As the current Chair of \r\nthe Task Force, Austria is very grateful for the work \r\ncarried out by the Secretariat under the outreach \r\nprogramme. Let me share some aspects of the Task \r\nForce’s work under the Austrian chairmanship.  \r\n The Task Force’s work is based on the Stockholm \r\nForum Declaration of 2000. The Declaration cites the \r\nquest for mutual understanding as one of the most \r\nimportant lessons to be learned from the Holocaust. \r\nThe commitments it enshrines originate from the \r\nunprecedented character of the Holocaust, which will \r\nalways hold a universal meaning. The Task Force’s \r\nworking groups function as a unique network of \r\ninternational cooperation comprising some of the \r\nworld’s leading experts in the field of education, \r\nremembrance and research. The intention is that \r\nteachers, students and society as a whole learn about \r\nthe Holocaust and the lessons to be drawn from it for \r\npresent and future generations. Task Force efforts to \r\nmobilize support and expertise for Holocaust \r\nmemorials contribute to the culture of Holocaust \r\nremembrance. Special working groups focus on the \r\ngenocide against the Roma, as well as on the Holocaust \r\nand other genocides. \r\n The Task Force by its very nature is particularly \r\nconcerned with tendencies of diminishing or denying \r\nthe Holocaust. The Task Force is comprised of \r\n25 member States, but it carries its mission beyond its \r\nown geographical range. Gaining knowledge about and \r\ndealing with the Holocaust should be further \r\nmainstreamed. That calls for a broader communication \r\nstrategy with the aim of having Holocaust \r\nremembrance generally accepted as part of human \r\nrights education and learning. One of the Task Force’s \r\nmain goals under the Austrian chairmanship is to \r\nimprove medial outreach. Its website serves as an open \r\nand accessible resource for mainstreaming Holocaust \r\neducation, remembrance and research. The Task Force \r\nmakes its tools accessible to the general public and \r\nseeks to deepen its cooperation with other \r\norganizations pursuing similar objectives. \r\n On 10 November 2008, the day of remembrance \r\nof the 1938 pogroms, Task Force member States will \r\ncome together with representatives of the United \r\nNations, the European Union, the Council of Europe \r\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope to discuss common objectives and experiences. \r\nMy delegation is very pleased that the Special Adviser \r\nof the Secretary General for the Prevention of \r\nGenocide, Mr. Francis Deng, will also be present at \r\nthat special event. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): In 2005, when the United \r\nNations Holocaust remembrance programme was \r\ncreated, an invitation was extended to all Member \r\nStates to remember the Holocaust and to build societies \r\nbased on inclusion, human dignity and respect for all \r\npersons. It is not good enough for us to stand here \r\ntoday and say that we remember and mourn what \r\nhappened over six decades ago, for no one can truly \r\ncomprehend the suffering of those who perished in the \r\nHolocaust. But we do understand that the attempted \r\nextermination of the Jewish people was a crime against \r\nA/63/PV.37  \r\n \r\n08-58387 34 \r\n \r\nall of humanity, and we understand that the prevention \r\nof genocide is a fundamental responsibility of the \r\ninternational community today. \r\n Societies built on an ethos of tolerance and \r\nacceptance, where all forms of racism and \r\ndiscrimination are equally unacceptable, are needed \r\nnow more than ever. Today, discrimination and \r\nintolerance have not yet been eradicated. Doing so is \r\ncentral to the task of preventing genocide and crimes \r\nagainst humanity in the future. \r\n Canada is both supportive of and pleased with the \r\nenergy and dedication the United Nations Department \r\nof Public Information has put into implementing \r\nresolution 60/7 of 2005. The Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/63/316) provides an impressive list of activities that \r\nhave been undertaken since then, including initiatives \r\ncommemorating the end of the Holocaust, network-\r\nbuilding, academic seminars, civil society engagement \r\nand developing information products for educators. \r\nCanada would like that work to continue in years to \r\ncome. \r\n We have been struck by the fact that so many \r\ncivil society organizations and artists responded to the \r\nUnited Nations call to work together in ensuring that \r\nthe Holocaust is never forgotten. We note in that \r\ncontext that a Toronto-based multinational group of \r\nchildren came to the United Nations lobby last year to \r\nperform extracts from Oratorio Terezin, a moving piece \r\nbased on poetry written by children in the Terezin \r\nghetto.  \r\n In Canada, we have acted to educate our citizens \r\non the Holocaust. An annual Canadian Holocaust \r\nRemembrance Day has been established, at which the \r\nPrime Minister, political party leaders and \r\nparliamentarians appear with Holocaust survivors on \r\nParliament Hill to ensure that the memory of the \r\nHolocaust is never lost. Canadian archival \r\ncollections — including the Jacob M. Lowy Collection, \r\nwhich contains some of the earliest attempts to \r\ndocument and publicize the Holocaust — have been \r\nmade available for education and research. The \r\nCanadian Government has provided funding to the \r\nMontreal Holocaust Memorial Centre and the \r\nVancouver Holocaust Education Centre, and is \r\ncurrently providing multi-year funding for the creation \r\nof a new human rights museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba. \r\nAlso, Canada has been active in exploring the question \r\nof Holocaust-era cultural property.  \r\n Canada is very pleased to see that the Department \r\nof Public Information has used the entire United \r\nNations network to ensure that the message reach \r\naudiences around the world. We applaud the fact that \r\nthe outreach programme makes every effort to warn \r\nagainst the consequences of anti-Semitism and other \r\nforms of discrimination.  \r\n It is very impressive to see so many events and \r\ncountries in the Secretary-General’s report. That \r\nhaving been said, as United Nations information \r\ncentres are only present in some countries, we all need \r\nto do even more to ensure that this messaging reaches \r\nthe entire world. It is up to national Governments to fill \r\nthe gap where there is no United Nations presence. \r\n Canada also notes the importance of resolution \r\n61/255 of 2007, which urges all Member States \r\nunreservedly to reject any denial of the Holocaust as a \r\nhistorical event, either in full or in part, or any \r\nactivities to that end. \r\n In June 2007, Canada took the first step towards \r\nbecoming a full member in the Task Force for \r\nInternational Cooperation on Holocaust Education, \r\nRemembrance and Research. Membership in the Task \r\nForce will strengthen our ability to contribute to the \r\nconstruction of societies, both in Canada and around \r\nthe world, that are based on human dignity and where \r\nacts like the Holocaust are no longer possible. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n In conclusion, Canadians, like all members of the \r\ninternational community, have a duty to remain vigilant \r\nwith respect to all forms of racism and discrimination, \r\nincluding anti-Semitism. We must ensure that the \r\nmemory of the Holocaust is never lost. Canada, for its \r\npart, is firmly committed to that end. \r\n Mr. Hill (Australia): It is now over 60 years since \r\nthe world saw the defeat of a barbaric and tyrannical \r\nNazi regime that had been set on the systematic \r\neradication of the Jewish people. Australia considers \r\nthe genocide perpetrated against the Jewish people \r\nduring the Holocaust to be the most abhorrent of \r\ncrimes. It cost many millions of lives and caused \r\nimmeasurable damage and dislocation to the lives of \r\nmany millions more. Its effects have been profound for \r\na number of generations and continue to be felt today. \r\n The Holocaust showed the depths to which \r\nhumankind can descend and made clear to the world \r\nthe devastating consequences of anti-Semitism, racial \r\n A/63/PV.37\r\n \r\n35 08-58387 \r\n \r\nhatred and persecution. However, it is a sad fact that \r\nanti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, racism and religious \r\nintolerance continue to exist to this day. \r\n Australia commends the work of the United \r\nNations Programme of outreach on the Holocaust and \r\nthe United Nations, as detailed in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/63/316). Since its establishment in \r\n2006, the programme has worked actively to meet the \r\naims of resolution 60/7 on Holocaust remembrance, \r\nincluding through memorial and educational activities, \r\nexhibitions and media outreach. Raising awareness of \r\nthe Holocaust not only helps us to remember the many \r\nvictims but also serves as a reminder of the need to \r\nremain vigilant and to take steps to prevent such a \r\nhorror from happening again. \r\n Mr. Ndabarasa (Rwanda): My delegation \r\ncommends the Secretary-General for his report, \r\nentitled “Programme of outreach on the ‘Holocaust and \r\nthe United Nations (A/63/316)’”.  \r\n Remembrance of the Holocaust serves first and \r\nforemost to commemorate the victims of the \r\nHolocaust, to educate a generation of young people \r\nabout the Holocaust and genocide, to raise awareness \r\nacross the broader public and to stimulate more people \r\nto use their voice and challenge society’s values. \r\nRwanda, as a nation that has experienced the horrors of \r\ngenocide, fully appreciates the significance of \r\nremembrance and the role it plays in reconciliation and \r\nthe prevention of future genocides.  \r\n My delegation commends the work that the \r\nDepartment of Public Information has undertaken with \r\nvarious stakeholders and through a variety of mediums \r\nto ensure that the lessons from the Holocaust and the \r\ngenocide in Rwanda are disseminated to as wide an \r\naudience as possible. Rwanda has received generous \r\nsupport in exposing what led to the Rwandan genocide \r\nof 1994.  \r\n My delegation appreciates the work of other \r\norganizations that are educating and exposing  \r\n \r\n \r\nintolerance in varied forms that may graduate into \r\ngenocide or acts of genocide. Those noble efforts \r\ndeserve commendation and the good work must be \r\ncontinued, because hate and intolerance are still forces \r\nin our world. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n I now call on the representative of Iran to \r\nexercise the right of reply. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): Today \r\nthe General Assembly heard baseless and absurd \r\ndistortions by certain States against the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran. We reject those distortions and \r\nexpress our concern over and condemnation of the \r\nmisuse of this body by certain circles to pursue some \r\nunwarranted political goals. \r\n We, along with others, have condemned and \r\ncontinue to condemn genocide against any race or \r\nethnic or religious group as a crime against humanity. \r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate that unambiguous \r\nposition here again today. In our view, there is no \r\njustification for genocide of any kind, nor can there be \r\nany explanation for certain unfortunate attempts made \r\nby some, and particularly by the Israeli regime, to \r\nexploit past crimes as a pretext to commit new \r\ngenocides and crimes. \r\n We believe that to be a valid and serious concern \r\nthat the international community should not fail to \r\naddress. Unfortunately, certain political and media \r\ncircles have mischievously interpreted that genuine \r\nconcern and resorted to a campaign of misinformation \r\nand defamation against those who have called for a \r\nthorough examination of the incidents. \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 59. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
