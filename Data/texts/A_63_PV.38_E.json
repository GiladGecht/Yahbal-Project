(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 58 \r\n \r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/63/53 and \r\nAdd.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): In connection \r\nwith this item, I would like to recall that the General \r\nAssembly, on the recommendation of the General \r\nCommittee, decided at its 34th plenary meeting, on \r\n30 October 2008, to consider agenda item 58 in plenary \r\nmeeting and in the Third Committee. \r\n Taking into account that decision, the Assembly \r\nwill consider in plenary meeting the annual report of \r\nthe Human Rights Council on its activities for the year. \r\n Upon the conclusion of the debate in plenary on \r\nthis item, the General Assembly will revert to this \r\nagenda item in the context of its consideration of the \r\nreport of the Third Committee. \r\n The Assembly will now start its consideration of \r\nthe annual report of the Human Rights Council on its \r\nactivities for the year. \r\n The report of the Human Rights Council that is \r\nbeing presented to this sixty-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is a relevant document, particularly \r\nnow, when we are celebrating the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which \r\nis the original source of the rights, freedoms and \r\nethical and legal standards that compel us to recognize \r\nand respect the dignity, freedom and equality of all \r\nhuman beings, without discrimination of any nature, \r\nwhether political, social, religious, ethnic or of any \r\nother type.  \r\n The Universal Declaration is today more relevant \r\nthan ever. The active and motivating power of human \r\nrights compel us to fight together to eradicate the \r\nscourges afflicting today’s society, such as the food, \r\nenergy and financial crises, climate change, the \r\ndegradation of Mother Earth, human trafficking, state \r\nterrorism and violence against women and children, \r\namong other global evils.  \r\n This report of the Council is entirely consonant \r\nwith the Universal Declaration, the International \r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, the \r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural rights, the Vienna Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action and other international human rights \r\ninstruments that affirm that human rights are universal, \r\nindivisible, interdependent and progressive, and that \r\nthey must be addressed in a fair and equitable manner \r\non an equal basis, giving each one of them the same \r\nweight.  \r\n This report appears today before the highest \r\nauthority in the United Nations and provides us with \r\nmuch empirical data but also, above all, with the \r\ntransformative and dialectical force of human rights in \r\nsolving the main problems that oppress our world \r\ntoday. The contents of the report are relevant and \r\ntimely, as they rightly denounce the violations of \r\nhuman rights taking place in various parts of the world \r\nagainst various groups that are excluded and rendered \r\ninvisible and whose humanity is denied. The document \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 2 \r\n \r\nalso proactively shows us the path to follow to prevent, \r\nput an end to and compensate for those human rights \r\nviolations.  \r\n Significant topics such as the eradication of \r\nhunger and extreme poverty, access to water, the \r\nprotection of native peoples, the elimination of all \r\nforms of modern slavery, including human trafficking \r\nand economic exploitation, the eradication of all types \r\nof discrimination, respect for human rights in efforts to \r\ncombat terrorism and violations of the human rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people, are among the topics that this \r\nAssembly will have to deal with in the coming years.  \r\n We must remain committed to institutionalizing \r\nthe Human Rights Council as a forum that nourishes \r\nand enhances all the activities of the United Nations. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of \r\nNigeria and President of the Human Rights Council. \r\n Mr. Uhomoibhi (Nigeria): This past Friday, \r\n31 October 2008, I had the distinct honour and \r\nprivilege to present the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to the Third Committee of the General \r\nAssembly. I come before the Assembly in plenary this \r\nmorning to also apprise members on the activities of \r\nthe Council, in accordance with resolution 60/251. \r\n But permit me at the outset to say how very \r\ndelighted I am, Sir, to see you in the presidency of the \r\nAssembly. I am pleased to reaffirm the support of the \r\nHuman Rights Council to your leadership of the \r\nAssembly and to express our best wishes for your \r\nsuccessful tenure. \r\n Through you, Mr. President, I wish to thank the \r\nGeneral Committee for the decision taken on the \r\nallocation of the agenda item to the Third Committee, \r\nas contained in document A/C.3/63/1/Add.1 of \r\n30 October 2008, which resolved the modalities for the \r\npresentation of the annual report of the Council. It was \r\nindeed a reflection of the flexibility and cooperation of \r\nthe membership that that step was achieved. I hope that \r\nthe outcome will be built upon in the future. \r\n My predecessors, His Excellency Mr. Luis Alfonso \r\nde Alba of Mexico and His Excellency Mr. Doru \r\nRomulus Costea of Romania, had presented the Human \r\nRights Council’s reports to the sixty-first and sixty-\r\nsecond sessions of the General Assembly respectively, \r\ncovering the activities of the Council from June 2006 \r\nto June 2007. My current report covers the period of \r\nthe second cycle of the Council, including the ninth \r\nsession which took place from 8 to 24 September 2008. \r\n It will be recalled that the decision of the General \r\nAssembly three years ago to establish the Council \r\nmarked a significant development in United Nations \r\nefforts to place the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights on the front burner of global discourse. It \r\nreflected the commitment and resolve of Member States \r\nto revitalize the Organization’s role in guaranteeing the \r\nenjoyment of human rights for all peoples. In a very \r\nparticular sense, the decision to empower the Council \r\nto consider human rights situations in all countries \r\nthrough the mechanism of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview not only emphasized the principle of equality \r\namong all States, but also underscored the universality \r\nof all human rights. \r\n Against that backdrop, during its second cycle, \r\nthe Council continued the elaboration and conclusion \r\nof its institution-building process and addressed \r\nthematic and specific human rights situations around \r\nthe world. The Council began to operationalize its new \r\nmechanisms and subsidiary bodies, such as the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review, the Advisory Committee, \r\nthe Social Forum, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights \r\nof Indigenous Peoples, the Forum on Minority Issues \r\nand the special procedures. The Council enhanced its \r\nengagement with various stakeholders, including from \r\nnational institutions and representatives of civil society \r\norganizations. \r\n Although the Human Rights Council is now in its \r\nthird year of existence, it is still very much at an \r\nevolutionary stage. Consequently, the Council \r\nsometimes draws upon aspects of the strengths and \r\nachievements of its predecessor body, the Commission \r\non Human Rights, while striving to avoid its \r\nshortcomings both at the levels of substance and \r\nmethods of work. \r\n Allow me now briefly to highlight some aspects \r\nof the activities of the Human Rights Council. \r\n With regard to the review, rationalization and \r\nimprovement of the mandates of special procedure, \r\nwhich is a key aspect of the institution-building text, \r\nduring its sixth session in September and December \r\n2007, the Council commenced the review, rationalization \r\nand improvement of special procedures mandates at \r\nboth the thematic and country levels. In the review, \r\nrationalization and improvement process, some \r\nmandates were renewed, some were terminated and \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n3 08-58567 \r\n \r\nnew ones were created. In carrying out that process, the \r\nPresident of the Council availed himself of the \r\nmechanism of the Consultative Group to ensure greater \r\nparticipation by Council members in the decision-\r\nmaking process. \r\n At its seventh session, in March 2007, the \r\nCouncil held a high-level segment during which \r\ndignitaries representing States members of the Council \r\nin attendance welcomed the accomplishments of the \r\nCouncil since its inception. Many identified the \r\nchallenges that could be faced by the Council but \r\nexpressed their belief that the institution marked a \r\ndeparture that should bode well for the future of human \r\nrights. Significantly, during the session, the Council \r\nadopted resolutions and decisions covering civil, \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights, including \r\non the prevention of genocide, in commemoration of \r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. \r\n At its eighth session, the Council adopted the \r\noptional protocol to the International Covenant on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights. That was truly \r\nsignificant, as it represented an effort to make civil and \r\npolitical rights equal with economic, social and cultural \r\nrights, all of which are interrelated, interdependent, \r\nindivisible and universal. That important international \r\nhuman rights instrument is before the General \r\nAssembly for adoption at the current session. \r\n On the Universal Periodic Review, during the \r\nsecond cycle the Council began to implement the \r\nmechanism comprehensively. So far, 32 countries have \r\nbeen reviewed in a transparent and equal manner. The \r\noutcomes of the two sessions of the Working Group on \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review, held in April and May \r\n2008, were adopted during the eighth session in June \r\n2008. At the recent session in September, some \r\nMember States that had already been reviewed voluntarily \r\nshared their experiences on the implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the recommendations contained in the \r\noutcomes of the review. \r\n Also, at the ninth session, in September 2008, the \r\nCouncil received updates on the two regional \r\npreparatory meetings for the Durban Review Conference \r\non Racism, Xenophobia and related Intolerance, \r\nscheduled to take place in Geneva in April 2009. The \r\nmeetings were held in Brasilia and Abuja and produced \r\nframework documents as additional inputs for the \r\nreview process. \r\n In conformity with its mandate, the Council \r\naddressed serious human rights situations in various \r\nparts of the world. Accordingly, three special sessions \r\nwere held during the reporting period — regarding the \r\nhuman rights situation in Myanmar, the human rights \r\nviolations emanating from Israeli military attacks and \r\nincursions in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nparticularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, and the \r\nnegative impact of the worsening of the food crisis on \r\nthe realization of the right to food for all. By holding, \r\nfor the first time, a special session on the thematic \r\nissue on the right to food, the Council was able \r\nsubstantively to link its work with what is happening in \r\nthe real world, which has adverse effects on the lives of \r\nmillions of people. \r\n Given that we live in a globalizing world where \r\nan event in one part has the potential to affect life in \r\nother parts, the Council found it necessary to remain \r\nvigilant and to be seized of all situations, namely, of \r\ngrowing inequality, continuing armed conflicts and \r\nother menaces, such as climate change and the food \r\ncrisis. In dealing with those important issues, it is clear \r\nthat Member States must continue to muster the \r\nnecessary political will and commitment to overcome \r\nthe challenges that the world currently faces, mainly in \r\nthe human rights arena, if the Council is to fulfil \r\nexpectations. \r\n In that connection, it was therefore important \r\nthat, at its ninth session, the Council adopted a decision \r\non the holding of a commemorative session on the \r\noccasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. That historic event is \r\nscheduled to take place in Geneva on 12 December \r\n2008. Beyond providing a fitting opportunity for \r\ncommemorating the Universal Declaration on Human \r\nRights, that event is also expected to afford member \r\nStates an opportunity to reaffirm their faith in the core \r\nhuman rights values and principles. \r\n In conclusion, in adopting resolution 60/251, \r\nestablishing the Human Rights Council, three years \r\nago, the General Assembly sought to build an \r\ninstitution that would make a real difference in the \r\ngovernance of human rights at the universal level. It is \r\ngratifying today that the Human Rights Council, as \r\ndistinct from its preceding body, the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights, has already carved out a niche for itself \r\nwith regard to its methods of work. What needs to be \r\ndone is to ensure that the decisions and resolutions \r\nadopted by the Council on the variety of issues placed \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 4 \r\n \r\non its agenda are fully supported by the General \r\nAssembly in order to give concrete meaning and \r\nsubstance to the work of the Council. In that regard, \r\nthe Council needs to be provided with adequate \r\nresources to carry out its work, as requested in the \r\ndecision adopted by the Council at its ninth session \r\nentitled “Strengthening of the Human Rights Council”, \r\nwhich is contained in the report. \r\n All too often, most times without real \r\njustification, the Human Rights Council has been \r\ncriticized on its methods and the outcome of its work. \r\nLet me appeal here for greater circumspection, \r\nobjectivity and patience in assessing the work of the \r\nCouncil. Two years is hardly enough time to be overly \r\ncritical of an institution that we strongly believe holds \r\ngreat promise as a universal human rights body. \r\n I would like to reiterate my personal commitment \r\nto follow the path of my predecessors and to work \r\nclosely with the Council’s members to achieve the \r\nnoble objectives enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter and the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. It is our collective responsibility, working with \r\nobjectivity, candour and commitment, to ensure that \r\nthe Council lives up to its name and to the standards \r\nexpected of it. That is our duty. That is our expectation. \r\nThat indeed is our vocation as Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Ripert (France) (spoke in French): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The \r\ncandidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the potential \r\ncandidates and countries of Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia, as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Armenia, associate \r\nthemselves with this statement. A full version of my \r\nstatement has been distributed, and I should just like to \r\nemphasize a few points. \r\n I should like, first, to thank Ambassador Martin \r\nIhoeghian Uhomoibhi for submitting the third annual \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/63/53) and to \r\nthank Ambassador Doru Costea, former President of \r\nthe Council, who served for most of the period covered \r\nin this report. \r\n Pursuant to the decision on United Nations \r\nreform taken by heads of State at Government during \r\nthe 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly decided \r\nin 2006 to create the Human Rights Council to replace \r\nthe former Commission on Human Rights. Our \r\nobjective was to improve the United Nations human \r\nrights protection machinery in order to make it a \r\nmainstay of our Organization. We all know that peace, \r\nsecurity, development and human rights complement \r\none another, and are mutually reinforcing. It is through \r\ntheir joint promotion that we will strengthen collective \r\nwell-being. \r\n The Human Rights Council has been entrusted \r\nwith a ambitious mandate: to ensure the promotion of \r\nhuman rights for all, to make recommendations on \r\nserious violations of these rights in order to put an end \r\nto them, and to guarantee that human rights are taken \r\ninto account in all United Nations policies. The \r\nprinciples of universality, impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity must guide the Council’s work, which \r\nis based on cooperation and dialogue among States. We \r\nmust stress those guiding principles in the Assembly as \r\nwe review this report. \r\n Since its establishment, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has addressed many issues, on some occasions \r\nleading to major breakthroughs in human rights \r\nprotection. That is how the draft Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples, the draft International \r\nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \r\nEnforced Disappearance and, more recently, the draft \r\noptional protocol to the International Covenant on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights were drawn up. \r\n Three special sessions were held over the past \r\nyear. One dealt with the right to food and another with \r\nthe situation in Burma, which is still cause for great \r\nconcern. If the issue of human rights in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, which was previously addressed \r\nat a special session, must be debated in the Human \r\nRights Council, its members must make sure that they \r\nreach balanced solutions. \r\n The Human Rights Council’s mechanisms must \r\nbe consolidated through our shared commitment. In \r\nthis regard, the special procedures are one of the \r\nCouncil’s key tools. The serious human rights \r\nviolations in some countries justifies maintaining these \r\nprocedures. It must be reaffirmed that the primary \r\nobjective of these special procedures is to promote \r\nexpertise and to make recommendations. We call upon \r\nthe Council to remain vigilant for particularly serious \r\nsituations that deserve our full attention. \r\n The Universal Periodic Review is an innovative \r\nmechanism that should also help improve the human \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n5 08-58567 \r\n \r\nrights situation on the ground through dialogue and \r\ncooperation. Since its inception, 32 States were \r\nreviewed, seven of which are from the European \r\nUnion. We commend the seriousness with which these \r\n32 countries have granted this review. \r\n Although some positive developments have been \r\nnoted, many situations still deserve our full attention at \r\nthe upcoming sessions. The European Union hopes that \r\nthe 48 States that will submit themselves to the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review will do so in good faith and \r\nwith all the necessary rigour. The experience of the two \r\nprevious sessions should allow us to improve the \r\nreview. We must also ensure that the Council’s \r\nrecommendations and the pledges made by States \r\nunder review are effectively implemented. \r\n Due to the regularity of its meetings, the Human \r\nRights Council has become a virtually permanent \r\nentity with an ambitious and challenging mandate. Its \r\npast action provides us a glimpse of its great future \r\npossibilities. However, in order to go from words to \r\nconcrete action, we must ensure that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and its institutions can run smoothly. We \r\nshould all pledge to work towards that end.  \r\n The European Union calls for members of the \r\nUnited Nations to maintain close cooperation in the \r\nspirit of universality, impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity. It is the heritage of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, whose sixtieth \r\nanniversary we will celebrate soon and which must \r\nremain our common landmark. Similarly, the \r\nencouraging outcomes that we have already had within \r\nthe Council will lead to real progress in the effective \r\nenjoyment of human rights for all around the globe. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We thank \r\nAmbassador Uhomoibhi for his excellent presentation \r\nof the report of the Human Rights Council (A/63/53 \r\nand Add.1). Our thanks go also to Ambassador Doru \r\nCostea, who presided over the Council over much of \r\nthe period covered in the report. We welcome this \r\nopportunity to discuss the report in this Assembly to \r\nwhich the Council is a subsidiary body — as we \r\nwelcome the interactive exchange in which the \r\nPresident of the Council engaged with the Third \r\nCommittee last Friday. \r\n It is a pragmatic arrangement that is fully in \r\naccordance with the letter and spirit of resolution \r\n60/251, through which the Assembly created the \r\nCouncil. We hope that this debate will contribute to the \r\nawareness of the work of the Human Rights Council \r\nhere in New York and that our colleagues in Geneva \r\ncan benefit from it in tackling the challenges ahead. We \r\nwould also wish that the schedule of the General \r\nAssembly plenary can in the future be arranged in such \r\na manner that this debate does not coincide with Third \r\nCommittee meetings. We believe that a more energetic \r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nCouncil is desirable and that it should not necessarily \r\nbe limited to the consideration of the report during the \r\nfall season. \r\n The third report of the Council to the Assembly \r\nillustrates the steady progress that has been made in the \r\narea of institution-building. After the adoption of the \r\nrelevant package of measures last year, the Council has \r\nnow gone through the first round of Universal Periodic \r\nReview (UPR), an instrument that we hope will make \r\nan important contribution to the dialogue on human \r\nrights issues and the implementation of human rights \r\nstandards worldwide. In this context, we look forward \r\nto our own presentation under the UPR on 5 December. \r\nWhile it is of course too early to offer a final view on \r\nthe value of the UPR, there are a number of \r\nobservations that we can already offer at this point. We \r\ncertainly welcome the emphasis on the implementation \r\nof human rights standards in the framework of the \r\nUPR. That emphasis is both essential for addressing \r\nthe implementation gap that still exists 60 years after \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, and it is also in keeping with the mandate of \r\nthe Council given to it by the Assembly.  \r\n The first experiences gathered also show \r\nadditional potential. In particular, the relationship \r\nbetween the UPR and the treaty body processes needs \r\nto be addressed. UPR and the presentation before treaty \r\nbodies are of course very different in nature, both as \r\nfar as their legal foundation is concerned and their \r\napplication in practice. Nevertheless, they are the two \r\nessential mechanisms through which States present \r\ntheir human rights record, and we must therefore \r\nexplore synergies between the two. The treaty body \r\nmechanisms can and should be strengthened through \r\nthe UPR. In particular, the outcome of the UPR and the \r\nvoluntary commitments of States should be fed into the \r\ntreaty body processes and become part of the dialogue \r\nbetween States and the treaty bodies, insofar as they \r\nare relevant for the treaty under discussion, of course. \r\nThat would make the two mechanisms mutually \r\nbeneficial while preserving their distinct \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 6 \r\n \r\ncharacteristics. It would also be useful to get \r\nconsolidated input from treaty bodies themselves on \r\nthis question, such input resulting from the ongoing \r\ndiscussions in inter-Committee meetings. \r\n The Council has almost concluded its complex \r\nand challenging review of the special procedures, as \r\nwe have heard from the President of the Council. The \r\nresults are generally satisfactory. While we support \r\nfinalizing the tasks by reviewing one mandate that is \r\nstill outstanding, we also believe that we must now \r\nshift our focus to the cooperation offered by States. \r\nState cooperation with the special procedures offers a \r\nlot of room for improvement and we expect those who \r\nserve as members of the Council to exercise leadership \r\nand set positive examples in that respect.  \r\n All States that are members of the Council have \r\npledged to fully cooperate with it, and issuing a \r\nstanding invitation to special procedures is one of the \r\nbest ways of living up to that pledge in practice. We \r\nhope that the imminent conclusion of the review will \r\nlead a significant number of States — especially those \r\nthat put their names forward for membership on the \r\nCouncil — to issue such invitations. \r\n As a novel development during the reporting \r\nperiod, the Council has for the first time held a special \r\nsession on a thematic issue. We strongly welcome that \r\ndevelopment and hope that the Council will continue to \r\nexplore the potential of such ad hoc thematic meetings \r\nas the one held on the food crisis. We believe that such \r\nmeetings could greatly contribute to the relevance of \r\nthe work of the Council also outside of Geneva and put \r\na renewed emphasis on its thematic work. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I \r\nthank the President of the Human Rights Council for \r\nhaving introduced the report on its activities (A/63/53). \r\nThe Human Rights Council strengthens the universal \r\nsystem for the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights within the United Nations. That unique nature of \r\nthe Council is reflected by the fact that its annual \r\nreport is considered in plenary by the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n I would like to share four main messages with the \r\nAssembly today. First, with the conclusion in June \r\n2007 of the institutional consolidation of the Human \r\nRights Council, the work of that organ gained in \r\nsubstance and the Council is now fully able to \r\ndischarge its functions. The implementation of the \r\nuniversal periodic review as of April 2008 made it \r\npossible to consider human rights situations in 32 \r\ncountries in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation. In \r\nmost cases, it was thus possible to collectively identify \r\nways and means of improving the human rights \r\nsituations in our countries.  \r\n It is important to emphasize that the three reports \r\nthat serve as the basis for the review are an excellent \r\nsource of information about the country concerned. \r\nThe commitment of State authorities at the highest \r\nlevel, as well as the participation of civil society, are \r\nindispensable components if we wish to realize the full \r\npotential of that new mechanism. \r\n The determining factor for its success remains, \r\nhowever, the political will of the States under review to \r\nimplement the recommendations arising from the \r\nreview. Only after a complete review cycle will we be \r\nin a position to genuinely evaluate progress in the \r\nfield, thanks to that new instrument. We also deem it \r\nimportant to take into consideration the contributions \r\nof that new mechanism to our work here in New York. \r\n Secondly, over the past 18 months the Council \r\nhas considered substantive matters and, thanks to its \r\nspecial sessions, responded rapidly to human rights \r\nsituations throughout the world. In addition, for the \r\nfirst time the Council held a held a special session on a \r\nthematic issue: the right to food in the context of the \r\ncurrent world food crisis. In its working methods, there \r\nis still a problem with the Council’s ability to forecast \r\nits activities. That could perhaps be remedied by \r\ncreating a programme of work for the coming year so \r\nas to distribute its workload over three annual sessions \r\nby grouping agenda items, so that each session does \r\nnot have to consider every single item, as is done \r\ntoday. \r\n Similarly, we must find a way to keep our \r\nGovernments, the international and national media and \r\nother interested parties focused not only on the main \r\nsession of the Council held in March, but also on the \r\nother sessions held throughout the year. \r\n Thirdly, the support of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in its \r\ncapacity as the secretariat of the Council, is \r\nindispensable to the smooth operation of its work, and \r\nwe warmly thank the High Commissioner. \r\n We are aware of the fact that, with an organ that \r\nis nearly permanently in session, the intensity of the \r\nwork and the relationship between the High \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n7 08-58567 \r\n \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and member States \r\nhas increased considerably. Nevertheless, we wish to \r\nrecall that the mandate of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights was established in 1993 by the General \r\nAssembly and that its structure is part of the \r\nSecretariat. We strongly oppose any attempt to \r\nestablish Council control over the activities, priorities \r\nand fieldwork of the High Commissioner. The Office \r\nof the High Commissioner must continue to enjoy the \r\nnecessary autonomy to ensure the defence and \r\npromotion of all human rights throughout the world, as \r\nspelled out in its 1993 mandate. \r\n Fourthly and finally, two and a half years after \r\nthe creation of the Human Rights Council — and thus \r\nhalfway to its status review by the General Assembly \r\nin 2011 — we note that we still have no clear notion of \r\nthe attribution of competencies between the Council \r\nand the General Assembly’s Third Committee. \r\nSwitzerland is committed to the complementarity of \r\nthe two organs through reinforcing cooperation and \r\nreducing overlapping. \r\n The General Assembly, as a universal body, \r\nshould serve essentially as a framework for general \r\nreference and play a programming role. The Human \r\nRights Council has an operational part to play in the \r\nimplementation of political commitments assumed by \r\nStates in the light of their pertinent international legal \r\nobligations. The General Assembly could, for instance \r\nask the Council to use its mechanisms to discuss a \r\nparticular theme with respect to a human rights \r\nsituation, and then to report on operational follow-up. \r\n The Council could also propose to the General \r\nAssembly that it discuss a particular topic, and the \r\nAssembly could decide either to send it back to the \r\nCouncil to be discussed and followed up at the \r\noperational level, or to address the matter itself at the \r\nuniversal level, given its importance or its basic nature. \r\nUltimately, by establishing a dynamic and positive \r\ninterrelationship between the Council and the Third \r\nCommittee, both will be strengthened in their \r\nrespective roles and not through a rigid separation of \r\ncompetencies. \r\n In conclusion, the Council has moved ahead by \r\nconsolidating its institutional framework and \r\nstrengthening human rights through dialogue. It is on \r\nthe right path towards a credible and efficient \r\ninternational system of protection. \r\n The Human Rights Council is still a young organ \r\nand it is normal that some adjustments may be \r\nnecessary. That requires all of us, however, to give it \r\nour unswerving commitment in New York and in \r\nGeneva. Switzerland can be relied on to serve as one of \r\nthe engines of the Council’s progress. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, I would like to extend my appreciation to the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council for his \r\ncomprehensive report to the General Assembly today. \r\nWe commend the completion by the Council of the \r\nprocess of institution-building and reviewing and \r\nestablishing the mechanism and its subsidiary bodies \r\nthat enable it to enter the implementation phase of its \r\nprogrammes and mandates, as stipulated in resolution \r\n60/251. Creation of new mandates focusing on \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights, and holding of \r\npanel discussions on a number of important subjects, \r\nare worthy achievements of the Council in its new era. \r\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council, \r\nbased on the valuable experiences and lessons learned \r\nfrom the strengths and shortcomings of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, provided us with new \r\nhope and the necessary motivation to consider human \r\nrights issues that must be addressed if we are to find \r\nsound, decent solutions to the challenges that confront \r\nus. The Human Rights Council must be the focal point \r\nof reliance, hope and participation for all peoples and \r\nGovernments in addressing global human rights \r\nchallenges. As a forum for dialogue, understanding and \r\ncooperation in which to achieve the universal \r\nrealization of human rights, it must be devoid of \r\npoliticization. \r\n We maintain that the reform of the United \r\nNations in the field of human rights will not bear fruit \r\nunless partiality, selectivity and double standards are \r\ndealt with promptly and vigorously. Furthermore, there \r\nis a need to approach human rights issues in a \r\ncomprehensive, cooperative and constructive manner. \r\nManipulation and abuse of the United Nations human \r\nrights mechanisms and machineries have, \r\nunfortunately, become a prevalent tradition and \r\nexercise by certain countries and should no longer be \r\ntolerated, primarily because of their destructive impact \r\non the credibility, efficiency and legitimacy of these \r\nmechanisms and machineries. \r\n In that respect, the mechanism of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review constitutes a breakthrough in United \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 8 \r\n \r\nNations intergovernmental human rights activities. The \r\nmerit of this mechanism is that it ensures universality, \r\nobjectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality in the work \r\nof the United Nations human rights machinery. The \r\nactual performance of the mechanism in a logical \r\ncontext should allow the human rights machinery to act \r\nbeyond political interests. We appreciate the degree of \r\ntransparency and the constructive examination of \r\nsituations under the Universal Periodic Review during \r\nthe discussion of the challenges that lie ahead, given \r\nthat, in any State, there is always room for \r\nimprovement. \r\n My delegation is of the opinion that, as the Third \r\nCommittee’s prerogative, it is necessary and timely to \r\npay greater attention to its designated work and \r\nmandate and to those of the Human Rights Council. In \r\nprinciple, the Third Committee should focus primarily \r\non policy-oriented deliberations and discussions in \r\norder to provide strategic policy recommendations to \r\nthe General Assembly that will, in turn, guide the \r\ninternational community, in particular the Human \r\nRights Council, in further enhancing the promotion and \r\nprotection of all human rights. In that context, the \r\nconsideration of country-specific situation proposals \r\ncategorically falls within the purview of the Human \r\nRights Council and its pertinent mechanism. \r\n The Human Rights Council is the competent \r\nspecialized United Nations organ responsible for \r\nconsidering human rights situations in all countries. In \r\na logical context, the unhindered and smooth \r\nfunctioning of the mechanisms of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, in particular the Universal Periodic Review, \r\nwould enable the human rights machinery to function \r\nwith impartiality, prudence and consistency. The \r\noverwhelming majority of the Member States believe \r\nthat the ongoing selective presentation of country-\r\nspecific human rights resolutions in the General \r\nAssembly runs counter to the mandate of Human \r\nRights Council and undermines its competence and \r\nauthority. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that, at \r\nthis crucial juncture, in which we are facing real \r\nhuman rights challenges in many parts of the world, \r\nthe Human Rights Council should rely on the \r\nprinciples of objectivity, cooperation, transparency and \r\nconsensus, and should, in discharge of its historic \r\nmandate, undertake to rectify the past shortcomings of \r\nthe United Nations human rights machinery. \r\nAccordingly, we are determined to continue our \r\nconstructive cooperation with the Council in favour of \r\nthe promotion and protection of human right all over \r\nthe world. \r\n Mr. Costea (Romania) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme to convey my gratitude to Ambassador Martin \r\nUhomoibhi for his work as President of the Human \r\nRights Council. It falls to him to lead the Council \r\nduring a period in which we will have to show that the \r\ninstitutionalization of the Council and its functioning \r\nin what we could call a normal mode will not mean a \r\nreturn to the routine of the past. That is one of the \r\nchallenges I will address later in my statement. We \r\nwish him every possible success in his work and assure \r\nhim of our full cooperation. Believe me, he will need \r\nit. I have been in his shoes and I know exactly what I \r\nam referring to.  \r\n Romania associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Ambassador of France on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. However, I should like to make a few \r\nadditional comments on the results of the Council’s \r\nwork, the atmosphere surrounding that work during the \r\nmost recent cycle and the challenges that the Council, \r\nand especially the Member States, will have to face in \r\nthe coming months.  \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n Two and a half years ago, the establishment of the \r\nCouncil was decided in this very Hall. It is good to see \r\nthe annual report of the Council addressed again in the \r\nplenary of the General Assembly, proving that we are \r\nindeed on the right track in giving human rights issues \r\nthe priority they deserve alongside the peace, security \r\nand cooperation issues that form the three pillars of the \r\nwork of the United Nations. We echo statements made \r\nat the thirty-second meeting of the Third Committee \r\nlast Friday and encourage Member States to continue \r\nconsideration of future annual reports of the Human \r\nRights Council in the plenary of the General Assembly. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The results of the work that was done during the \r\nsecond cycle of the Council are known and there is \r\nlittle need to recapitulate them. Some aspects are worth \r\nhighlighting, however. \r\n First, the institution-building process was \r\ncompleted and decisions were taken concerning \r\nimportant and highly-sensitive issues, such as the \r\nactual functioning of the Universal Periodic Review; \r\nthe review, rationalization and improvement of the \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n9 08-58567 \r\n \r\nspecial procedures mandates; and the nomination of the \r\nmandate holders. Those three mechanisms are \r\ninnovations in the landscape of the United Nations \r\nhuman rights machinery, and we all know only too well \r\nwhat it takes when change is needed and eagerly \r\nexpected in multilateral organizations. \r\n The Council expanded the use of tools that had \r\nbeen in place for some time now. For the first time, a \r\nspecial session was convened on a thematic issue. \r\nLikewise, panel discussions became part of the \r\noperative paragraphs of various resolutions. Some \r\nprocedural issues were clarified, and others — such as \r\ninteractive dialogue with special procedures mandate-\r\nholders and the participation of non-governmental \r\norganizations in the work of the Council — have now \r\nacquired the status of standard practices. \r\n Secondly, the overall attitude of Council \r\nmembers and observers alike was focused largely on a \r\npragmatic and solution-oriented approach to action, in \r\nparticular when the completion of the institution-\r\nbuilding process was at stake. Cross-regional dialogue \r\nand a certain readiness to try out-of-the-box options \r\nwere keys in that respect. Much work is still needed \r\nwith a view to increasing resistance to the temptation \r\nto politicize debate and expanding the cooperative \r\napproach to substantive issues. \r\n Some encouraging developments may be found in \r\nrelation to the Universal Periodic Review. The 32 \r\ncountries that took part in the exercise also took it \r\nseriously. More than once, it was said that the Review’s \r\neffects could be seen on the ground even before the \r\nReview itself had come to a conclusion. That was \r\npossible as a result of the preparations of various \r\ncountries for the process. Likewise, most of the \r\nrecommendations were accepted by the States under \r\nreview. That is indeed an important step forward, since \r\nit implies a formal commitment to acting with a view \r\nto implementing those recommendations. \r\n Thirdly, several challenges are facing the \r\nCouncil. One of them is ensuring the Council’s \r\ncredibility. Human rights are not mere abstractions, and \r\nEleanor Roosevelt’s often-quoted wise words remind \r\nus of that elementary fact. It follows that gross and \r\nsystematic violations of human rights must not be \r\nignored by the Council and that no attempt to bring \r\nthem before the Council be seen as a sign of \r\nselectivity. \r\n Another challenge is ensuring the effectiveness of \r\nCouncil action. That requires, among other things, \r\nfocused debates and decisions, resolutions that include \r\nconcrete and measurable steps, and follow-up to \r\nresolutions and commitments. Assessing the \r\nimplementation of the Council’s own decisions must \r\nbecome a regular practice; at the same time, new \r\nmechanisms need to be insulated from attempts to \r\nchange them immediately after their adoption. \r\n Last but not least, I should like to discuss what, at \r\nthe beginning of this statement, I called the routine of \r\nthe past. The Human Rights Council replaced the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, and what we need to do \r\nnow, more than ever, is replace the Commission’s \r\nmindset with a new approach. As it develops its \r\nroutine, the Council, as well as its observers, must \r\navoid slipping back into the old routine. The memory \r\nof the Commission’s faults is still very present, and so \r\ntoo is the shadow of the caterpillar that refused the \r\nlipstick yet still wanted to become a butterfly. \r\n Mr. Tarragô (Brazil): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi for presenting \r\nthe report of the Human Rights Council (A/63/53) and \r\nto express my delegation’s appreciation for the diligent \r\nand inclusive manner in which he conducted the work \r\nof the Council at its ninth session. \r\n Having completed the initial phase of \r\nreorganization in a new configuration, the Council is in \r\nthe process of consolidating its central role within the \r\nUnited Nations system in the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights. The Council’s report contains \r\ninformation regarding the extensive debates held on the \r\nvarious and urgent issues on its agenda. It also reflects \r\nthe significant contributions made by Member States, \r\nas well as by representatives of international \r\norganizations and civil society. \r\n The Brazilian delegation has endeavoured to \r\nparticipate actively in the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We initiated the draft resolution on human \r\nrights voluntary goals, which was adopted by \r\nconsensus. That initiative, sponsored by 24 countries in \r\nall regions of the world, seeks to strengthen existing \r\ninstruments in that area. It provides predictability and a \r\nconcrete framework for the achievement of human \r\nrights goals. It is our intention to launch the human \r\nrights voluntary goals during the commemoration of \r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights to be held in Geneva on 12 December. \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 10 \r\n \r\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nreflects the agreed objective, set out in the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome, of reinforcing multilateral \r\ninstruments and means to promote and protect human \r\nrights, which, alongside development and peace and \r\nsecurity, is one of the pillars of the United Nations. In \r\nfulfilling the commitment undertaken by our leaders in \r\n2005, we should maintain the current momentum and \r\ncontinue to pursue an invigorated Council. \r\n Experience has shown that we — developing and \r\ndeveloped countries alike — have to cope with \r\nparticular difficulties and sensibilities when it comes to \r\nhuman rights. We should recognize those difficulties \r\nand sensibilities and strive to address them in a \r\nconstructive and cooperative spirit. We should avoid \r\nfinger-pointing and levelling accusations simply to \r\nobtain political gain. Such practices do not promote \r\nhuman rights, but instead protect vested interests. \r\n Rather than repeating accusations from \r\nloudspeakers, we should make more use of \r\nnegotiations as a way to bring opposing views closer \r\ntogether. We firmly believe that cooperation, rather \r\nthan confrontation, is the best means to achieve the \r\ndesired goal, which should always be to ensure the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. Dialogue \r\nand cooperation should guide us towards that goal. \r\nThere should be no non-negotiable issues on the \r\nagenda of the Human Rights Council. \r\n My delegation is convinced that the best way to \r\nimprove the Council’s methods and operations is to \r\nfully engage in it. In that respect, we should make good \r\nuse of existing mechanisms such as the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review. As a comprehensive and \r\nnon-selective mechanism, the Review is a useful \r\ninstrument for addressing human rights situations \r\nworldwide. Both rigorous and constructive, the Review \r\nmechanism has created an environment of equality. It \r\ngives us an opportunity to recognize our shortcomings, \r\nto share our successful stories and to present solutions. \r\nCooperation, not accusations, should steer the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review exercise. \r\n We should go even further, we should identify \r\ndifficulties and make recommendations. The Council \r\nshould provide solutions and help partners to overcome \r\nexisting challenges. Member States should create a \r\npositive agenda for the Council by seizing the \r\nopportunity given to us by the Review mechanism. \r\n Brazil is ready to take concrete measures to assist \r\ninterested Member States in implementing Universal \r\nPeriodic Review-related recommendations. We are \r\nwilling to share our experiences and good practices \r\nwith interested developing countries through a South-\r\nSouth cooperation initiative. We believe that such an \r\napproach could be constructive and play a central role \r\nin strengthening the Human Rights Council. In \r\naddition, we believe it is necessary to implement the \r\nobjectives set out in resolution 60/251 and in the \r\ninstitutional package adopted last year. \r\n We should avoid overlapping functions among \r\nUnited Nations bodies so as to ensure that the \r\nmultilateral human rights system as a whole works in a \r\ncoherent and efficient manner. In that respect, we \r\ncontinue to regard the plenary of the General Assembly \r\nas the adequate locus for the consideration of the report \r\nof the Human Rights Council. \r\n We face many challenges to human rights these \r\ndays. The sentiment of growing intolerance is a serious \r\nconcern for the Brazilian Government. In a time of \r\nincreasingly harsh laws on migrants, we should not \r\ndepart from the commitment to the fundamental values \r\nof human rights. That matter should be part of our \r\ndialogue with a view to finding mutual understanding \r\nand to overcoming those challenges. \r\n We are also living in a particularly serious \r\nmoment due to the economic and financial crisis. \r\nDeveloping countries suffer the most from the harsh \r\neffects of the financial crisis, especially regarding the \r\nrealization of human rights. We should seek to ensure \r\nthat developing and least developed countries in \r\nparticular do not shoulder the burden of a crisis for \r\nwhich they have not been responsible. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I wish to convey my most heartfelt gratitude to \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAmbassador Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, for the quality of the \r\nCouncil’s report (A/63/53) and for the exemplary \r\nmanner in which he has led that body, whose \r\nstrengthening is of primary importance to my country. \r\n My delegation is gratified by the consensual \r\nformula adopted for the consideration of the report of \r\nthe Human Rights Council in the plenary session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which also enabled the Third \r\nCommittee to consider the recommendations \r\nformulated by the Human Rights Council. Although \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n11 08-58567 \r\n \r\nthat compromise is not entirely satisfactory, it is a \r\nmiddle way that could be copied in upcoming years \r\nwhile waiting for the 2010 review of the status of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. \r\n The consideration of the report of the Human \r\nRights Council, which coincides fortuitously with the \r\ncelebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \r\nprovides me with the opportunity to reaffirm Senegal’s \r\ndedication to the principles of the universality, \r\nindependence and indivisibility of all human rights, \r\nwhich should guide our initiatives and our decisions \r\nwithin the Council. \r\n After just under three years of existence, the \r\nHuman Rights Council provides us with objective \r\nreasons for hope and supports us in our historic choice \r\nto remedy the shortcomings of the former Commission \r\non Human Rights by replacing it with a body more \r\nadapted to the current international context. The \r\npromising results achieved by that young body, which \r\nquite rightly inspires both a great deal of hope and high \r\nexpectations, provide my delegation with objective \r\nreasons for satisfaction and support its belief that a \r\nbright future awaits the Human Rights Council. \r\n Indeed, the progress achieved by the Council \r\nduring its three years of existence is all the more \r\nsignificant given that this new body finalized its \r\ninstitutional architecture within the proposed time \r\nframe with the convening in August 2008 of the \r\ninaugural session of its Advisory Committee. \r\n Better yet, the important resolutions and \r\ndecisions adopted during the nine regular sessions and \r\nseven special sessions, including one devoted in May \r\n2008 to the global food crisis, bear eloquent witness to \r\nthe dynamism of the Human Rights Council and testify, \r\nif there is any need to do so, to the Council’s ability to \r\nrespond to situations that call for its attention and to \r\nconsider the many thematic issues on its agenda. \r\n The effective launch of the new Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism is further grounds for the \r\nsatisfaction and hope of my delegation. That innovative \r\nmechanism has just shown that it is possible to \r\nconsider human rights in an impartial way that is free \r\nof all politicization. The diversity of the first 32 States \r\nexamined within the framework of that mechanism is a \r\nsatisfying guarantee of the effectiveness of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism. \r\n Members of the Assembly will agree with me that \r\nthe mechanism will genuinely contribute to the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights only if it \r\nallows for the establishment of objective, transparent \r\nand constructive dialogue between the various \r\nstakeholders. It is our responsibility to pool our efforts \r\nto achieve that objective, since the smooth functioning \r\nof the mechanism will to a large extent determine the \r\ncredibility of the Human Rights Council. \r\n In fact, the impact of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview mechanism will be gauged only following the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations formulated \r\nduring those sessions. For that reason, my delegation \r\ncalls for the allocation of sufficient resources for the \r\nfund created to meet the technical assistance needs \r\nformulated within the framework of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review. Senegal is already preparing to be \r\nreviewed in 2009 by the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism and is eager to implement the \r\nrecommendations that will result from it. \r\n The encouraging progress made in the \r\nfunctioning of the Human Rights Council should not \r\nlead us to lose sight of the long and arduous road ahead \r\nin ensuring that this new body meets our hopes and \r\nexpectations. The contradictions noted here and there, \r\nwhich reflect the dynamism of our dialogue, must in no \r\nway undermine our determination or inhibit our desire \r\nto consolidate and strengthen the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We must continue to seek areas of \r\nconvergence and to work together to make dialogue \r\nand cooperation the basic principles guiding the work \r\nof that body and to ensure that justice and dignity for \r\nall prevail. \r\n In that respect, Senegal reiterates its support for \r\nthe rationalization and improvement of the special \r\nprocedures system, whose contribution to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights is essential. \r\nIn the same spirit, my delegation calls for prudence in \r\nconsidering the fate of certain mandates so as to ensure \r\nthat the Council’s decisions take into account realities \r\non the ground and the interests of all stakeholders. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s support for the recommendation by the \r\nHuman Rights Council on the adoption of the Optional \r\nProtocol to the International Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights, which will undoubtedly \r\ncontribute to re-establishing the balance between civil \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 12 \r\n \r\nand political rights on the one hand and economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights on the other. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation is grateful to the President of the Human \r\nRights Council, the representative of Nigeria in \r\nGeneva, for his presentation of the report of the \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/63/53), in keeping \r\nwith the importance that human rights deserve within \r\nthe agenda of our Organization.  \r\n Mexico is fully committed to the consolidation of \r\nthe Human Rights Council as the paramount organ \r\nentrusted with the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights by the Organization. My country played a \r\nconstructive role in the negotiations in the General \r\nAssembly that led to the creation of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and played an active part in the institutional \r\ndevelopment of the new organ, with the primary goal \r\nof ensuring its effectiveness.  \r\n Three years after its creation, the Council has the \r\nnecessary tools to tackle the essential goal that was \r\nentrusted to it. Not only has it set in motion the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism, which is \r\nwithout a doubt the most novel and promising tool it \r\nhas, but it has almost completed the process of review, \r\nrationalization and refinement of the special procedure \r\nmandates.  \r\n At the same time, the Council has upheld the \r\nactive participation of civil society in its work and has \r\nencouraged candidate States to present voluntary \r\npledges and commitments in the field of human rights.  \r\n Mexico welcomes the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil on its activities, which covers its work from \r\nSeptember 2007 to June 2008. Through three ordinary \r\nsessions and the same number of special sessions held \r\nduring the same period, the Council clearly \r\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of its new instruments. \r\nAn example of that can be seen in its review of critical \r\nsituations in various parts of the world, the adoption of \r\nseveral substantive resolutions and the renewal of a \r\nnumber of mandates.  \r\n In its task of protecting human rights, the \r\nCouncil, through the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism, has analysed the situations of 32 countries \r\nfrom all over the world on equal footing, thanks to a \r\nparticipatory and novel exercise.  \r\n Mexico has seen how useful that exercise is at the \r\nnational level, as it provided for a substantial dialogue \r\non human rights among the relevant actors. My country \r\nrecently completed the preparation of its national \r\nreport, which was presented yesterday to the Office of \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and which \r\nwill be reviewed by the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism in February 2009. Our report was \r\nelaborated on the basis of a comprehensive and broad-\r\nranging process that involved the legislative and \r\njudicial branches, 29 departments of the Mexican \r\nGovernment and consultations with civil society.  \r\n This year, the Council continued to carry out its \r\nimportant standard-setting activities. The adoption of \r\nthe Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights is a historical \r\nstep in the progressive development of international \r\nhuman rights law. As we declared earlier in our \r\nstatement to the Third Committee, the adoption of that \r\ninstrument by the General Assembly will give a new \r\ndimension to economic, social and cultural rights and \r\nwill thus finally place them on the same level as civil \r\nand political rights. \r\n Mexico promotes the effective coordination of \r\nwork between the General Assembly, in particular the \r\nThird Committee, and the Human Rights Council, in \r\norder to avoid overlapping and ensure specialization. \r\nWe urge all countries to actively participate in that \r\neffort. We appeal to the international community, in the \r\nlight of the upcoming review of the work of the \r\nCouncil in 2011, to redouble its efforts to further \r\nstrengthen that organ and elevate its status within our \r\nOrganization. The Human Rights Council is destined to \r\nplay a significant and relevant role in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights throughout the world. \r\n Mr. Edrees (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike at the outset to express our appreciation for the \r\nstatement by the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil before the General Assembly, which comes \r\nfollowing his valuable statement in the Third \r\nCommittee this past week at the opening of the general \r\ndebate on the report of the Council. The Third \r\nCommittee is the negotiating and expert technical arm \r\nof the General Assembly on all issues related to human \r\nrights and international human rights law, within a \r\nframework that includes all Member States of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n I wish to reiterate in that regard that we went \r\nalong with the ad hoc compromise agreement reached \r\nin the General Committee to consider the report both in \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n13 08-58567 \r\n \r\na plenary meeting of the General Assembly and in the \r\nThird Committee. We did so on the understanding that \r\nthe Third Committee will consider and act upon all the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s recommendations to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, including those dealing with the \r\ndevelopment of international law in the field of human \r\nrights, without prejudice to the right of Member States \r\nto present draft resolutions and decisions in the \r\nGeneral Assembly or the Third Committee on any issue \r\ncontained in the report. \r\n Indeed, the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, as a subsidiary organ of the General \r\nAssembly, has ushered in the dawn of a new and long-\r\nawaited era of joint action, with no politicization, \r\nselectivity or double standards. The Council has \r\ncontributed to establishing a setting that is favourable \r\nto overcoming the obstacles that shackled international \r\nefforts aimed at consolidating universal respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms in the past. \r\nThat was made possible by unifying standards and \r\nadopting a constructive, cooperative approach in \r\ndealing with human rights questions. Such an approach \r\nrests on the provision of advice and necessary technical \r\nand financial support upon the request of national \r\nGovernments, in the light of their responsibility to \r\npromote and protect the human rights of all their \r\ncitizens. The 2005 World Summit Outcome laid down \r\nthat foundation, which was more recently reinforced by \r\nthe launch of the Universal Periodic Review. \r\n Undoubtedly, the coincidence of the discussion of \r\nthe Council’s report this year with the celebration of \r\nthe 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights represents an important occasion to \r\nreiterate the lofty principles and international standards \r\nthat we all agreed to on the basis of our unified \r\ncollective efforts. It is also a reminder of our \r\ncommitment, in accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter and the relevant international instruments, to \r\nwork towards consolidating universal respect for \r\nhuman rights for all, without distinction and without \r\nshifting attention to certain aspects of human rights to \r\nthe detriment of others. \r\n Egypt welcomes the progress achieved in the \r\npractical implementation of the institutional framework \r\nlaid down in the Council this past year, in addition to \r\nthe positive development in reviewing the mandates of \r\nthe special procedures, the elaboration of mechanisms \r\nto deal with complaints and the establishment of the \r\nForum on Minority Issues. In addition, Egypt, as a \r\ncurrent member of the Council, is keen to support the \r\nCouncil’s ongoing efforts to fulfil our common \r\naspirations on the basis of the complementarity \r\nbetween the roles of national institutions and the \r\ninternational community, on the one hand, and of \r\nadditional human rights mechanisms, on the other. \r\n Our mutual desire to promote human rights \r\nthroughout the world and to make them common \r\ndenominators among all societies requires that we \r\ncommit ourselves to applying the fledgling Universal \r\nPeriodic Review to all States, on an equal footing and \r\nwithout exception, within a constructive interactive \r\nframework and with the participation of \r\nnon-governmental organizations and all segments of \r\ncivil society. We must also confront with firm resolve \r\nthe tendency of a few to presume to be the world’s \r\ncustodians of human rights on the basis of the flawed \r\nassumption — which has no substantive grounds — \r\nthat their values, cultures, legal and social justice \r\nsystems and human rights standards are superior to \r\nthose of others. That also means preserving the existing \r\ninstitutional balance among the main United Nations \r\norgans when addressing human rights issues.  \r\n Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Furthermore, we must thwart attempts to \r\ncircumvent the mandate of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil through the submission of country-specific \r\nresolutions — which can only lead to confrontation and \r\ndiscord — and to create structures parallel to the \r\nCouncil by, for example, unnecessarily extending the \r\nauthority of the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights beyond its mandate \r\nor by giving individuals in the offices of United \r\nNations developmental programmes responsibility for \r\nmonitoring the human rights situations in developing \r\ncountries, in contravention of the principle of equality \r\nin monitoring human rights situations in all countries, \r\nwhether developing or developed. \r\n Thus, we should work together with the United \r\nNations system to strengthen early warning capacities, \r\nrelying on authenticated and non-politicized \r\ninformation, and strengthen the cooperation of States \r\nwith the fact-finding missions established by the \r\nCouncil to investigate gross human rights violations, \r\nparticularly those committed against peoples under \r\nforeign occupation and in conflict situations. The \r\ninternational community’s efforts to achieve universal \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 14 \r\n \r\nrespect for human and peoples’ rights will not succeed \r\nunless we completely reject selectivity, politicization \r\nand double standards when addressing human and \r\npeoples’ rights, in particular the inalienable right to \r\nself-determination. \r\n In that context, it is imperative that the Council \r\nremain committed to ensuring respect for human rights \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories and to verifying \r\nfull compliance by Israel with its international \r\nobligations, including its commitment to cooperate \r\nfully with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in the Palestinian territories occupied \r\nsince 1967 and the Council’s fact-finding missions to \r\ninvestigate gross human rights violations. That includes \r\nallowing the required field visits to take place — the \r\nmost recent of which was the high-level fact-finding \r\nmission led by Bishop Desmond Tutu to investigate the \r\ntragic events that had taken place in Beit Hanoun — as \r\nwell as following the recommendations subsequently \r\nadopted by the Council. In that regard, Egypt supports \r\nthe Human Rights Council’s recommendation that the \r\nGeneral Assembly consider the mission’s report with \r\nthe participation of mission participants. The report on \r\nBeit Hanoun should be considered in a special meeting \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n Therefore, the financial resources necessary for \r\nall Council activities should be made available and the \r\nactivities of the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights should be supported so that it can \r\nprovide the necessary technical assistance and \r\nconsultation to Member States, assisting them in the \r\narea of capacity-building in order to achieve \r\ncomplementarity between the role of the Commission \r\nand that of the Council and between the role of the \r\ninternational community and that of national \r\nGovernments. \r\n Clearly, the adoption of the Optional Protocol to \r\nthe International Convention on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights, at the recommendation of the Human \r\nRights Council and following its adoption in the Third \r\nCommittee, represents an important step in restoring an \r\nequal international balance and focus on all aspects of \r\nhuman rights, together with civil and political rights, \r\nand fulfilling the common aspirations of peoples \r\nthroughout the world to exercise the right to \r\ndevelopment, a fundamental right that is profoundly \r\nrelated to all other rights. We hope that that important \r\nstep will strengthen efforts to bridge the gap between \r\nNorth and South and thus create improved living \r\nconditions that will contribute to the promotion of \r\nhuman rights both for individuals and for communities. \r\nWe hope that it will also strengthen efforts to combat \r\nall forms of discrimination throughout the world, \r\nwhether on the basis of race, gender, language or \r\nreligion, within the framework of the follow-up to our \r\nmutual commitments under the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action, in particular with regard to \r\ndiscrimination against women, national, ethnic, \r\nreligious and linguistic minorities, migrants and other \r\ngroups facing varying degrees of marginalization in \r\ntheir societies. In our efforts to that end, we must avoid \r\nany conditionalities that seek to impose on others \r\ncontroversial ideas that do not take into account the \r\ndiffering social, cultural and value systems of various \r\nsocieties or to link such ideas and concepts to \r\ndevelopment assistance and programmes. \r\n Finally, Egypt hopes that our collective efforts to \r\nstrengthen the cooperative approach that the \r\ninternational community has taken in addressing all \r\nhuman rights issues, based on mutual respect and \r\nwithin a framework of commitment to equal rights and \r\nobligations, compliance with the principles of \r\ninternational law and complementarity between \r\ninternational human rights law and international \r\nhumanitarian law, will enable the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to fully play the role to which it aspires and \r\nsend the lofty message for which it was created, in a \r\nmanner that will strengthen our joint quest to \r\nconsolidate universal respect for the human rights of \r\nall, without any exception. \r\n Ms. Banks (New Zealand): New Zealand joins \r\nothers in expressing its appreciation to Ambassador \r\nUhomoibhi for his report on the second cycle of the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/63/53). We also thank \r\nAmbassador Costea for his work as former President of \r\nthe Council. New Zealand wishes to see the Council \r\nlive up to its mandate and reach its full potential to \r\nrespond quickly and effectively to human rights \r\nsituations, while promoting open, inclusive dialogue \r\nand cooperation with concerned countries.  \r\n The Council can help States to effectively address \r\ngaps between the standards embodied in the core \r\nhuman rights treaties and the everyday realities that \r\nindividuals face. As a demonstration of its commitment \r\nto human rights, New Zealand is standing for election \r\nto the Human Rights Council next year, and we hope to \r\nbe the first member of the body from the Pacific \r\nregion. \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n15 08-58567 \r\n \r\n The Council provides an opportunity to focus on \r\ninnovation and the exchange of effective practices in \r\nthe implementation of human rights. The report on the \r\nsecond cycle illustrates the Council’s evolving capacity \r\nto implement its promotion and protection mandate. \r\nBuilding on the foundations laid in the institution-\r\nbuilding package adopted only last year, the Council \r\nhas seen an important consolidation of its institutions \r\nand mechanisms, in particular the renewal of mandates \r\nunder its system of special procedures, including those \r\non specific human rights situations, and the \r\ncommencement of the Universal Periodic Review \r\n(UPR). \r\n Review and assessment are critical elements in \r\nthe effective implementation of human rights. In that \r\nregard, New Zealand very much welcomes the \r\nestablishment of the UPR. We hope that an overarching \r\nand regular review of every country through the UPR, \r\nin addition to the more comprehensive and specific \r\nreporting processes of the treaty bodies, will help \r\nreduce that gap between policy and practice. In New \r\nZealand, we are currently examining our own human \r\nrights performance in preparation for participating in \r\nthe UPR next year and have recently completed a \r\nround of domestic consultations on our own report. \r\n It is only over time that we will all see the true \r\nresults of the UPR. However, our initial view is that \r\nthe UPR has great potential. We are encouraged by the \r\nevolution in the scope of the recommendations that \r\nhave emerged from the first two sessions. We urge \r\nStates to remain committed to the process through the \r\nimplementation of those recommendations. \r\n The exchange of effective practices and the \r\nidentification of capacity-building and technical \r\nassistance needs are essential to the UPR process. For \r\nNew Zealand, a Pacific nation, we expect the UPR to \r\nfacilitate dialogue with our Pacific neighbours on \r\nhuman rights. Earlier this year, we were pleased to \r\nassist the Kingdom of Tonga to prepare its UPR report, \r\nand in support of the UPR, New Zealand will host a \r\nseminar in early 2009 for Pacific countries to exchange \r\nviews on the UPR and to engage in capacity-building. \r\n There are many positive developments in the \r\nCouncil’s working methods and, as with any new body, \r\nthe Council’s working methods will continue to evolve \r\nas it establishes routine practices and learns to manage \r\nits workload. We welcome the increased transparency \r\nof sessions, including the use of webcasting, and are \r\nencouraged by the increasingly open negotiation of \r\nresolutions. \r\n However, New Zealand is concerned at the \r\nincreasing pressures on small delegations that can \r\nundermine their effective participation in the Council \r\nand its working groups. At this juncture, we look to the \r\nCouncil to consider a more predictable and manageable \r\nwork programme, to address the proliferation of \r\nmeetings and to identify ways to consolidate the wealth \r\nof information it processes through its regular and \r\nspecial sessions. \r\n We urge the Council to move towards a clear and \r\npredictable annual programme of work. We encourage \r\nfurther work to be done to make more effective use of \r\nmeeting time for working groups, the streamlining of \r\ntexts and a renewed focus on the implementation, \r\nrather than on mere restatement, of agreed standards. \r\n New Zealand believes the Council can contribute \r\nto development and security through the effective \r\nimplementation of human rights. If we are elected to \r\nthe Council next year, we shall contribute, to the best \r\nof our ability, to the realization of this objective in a \r\nconstructive, fair and open manner. \r\n The Council must not let debate on difficult \r\nhuman rights issues undermine progress on the broad \r\nagenda of human rights, where cooperation and \r\nconsensus have been the norm and where we can and \r\nmust improve the standard of implementation.  \r\n We look to the Council to provide leadership in \r\neffective practices to promote and protect human rights \r\nat the national level, including with respect to the \r\nmanagement of competing priorities in implementing \r\nand reporting on human rights obligations. And we all \r\ntogether look to delegations to focus on the \r\nimplementation of the standards we have agreed in the \r\npast 60 years, which are comprehensive, robust and \r\nuniversal. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation wishes to express its appreciation to the \r\nAmbassador Uhomoibhi, President of the Human \r\nRights Council, for his statement to the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n As a member of the Human Rights Council, we \r\nare pleased to note that one year after its adoption, the \r\nCouncil’s institution-building package has now moved \r\ninto the operational phase of its various mechanisms, \r\nincluding the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 16 \r\n \r\n It is also gratifying to recall that the first group of \r\n32 States, including Ghana, was reviewed under that \r\nreview mechanism. It is our view that this process has \r\nbeen a worthwhile innovation that is designed to \r\naddress the obstacles to the full promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and to assist in \r\nstrengthening States’ capacity to implement human \r\nrights commitments and contributions through dialogue \r\nand cooperation, with a view towards the prevention of \r\nhuman rights violations. \r\n When Ghana was reviewed in May 2008, its \r\ndelegation used the occasion to brief the Council on \r\nmeasures the Government had taken to make Ghana a \r\nmore tolerant society, including through increased \r\nrespect for the rule of law, the strides it had made \r\ntowards democratic rule, and reforms introduced to \r\nnurture a human rights culture to improve, inter alia, \r\nthe lives of children, women and the marginalized \r\nsegments of society. It also addressed the Council on \r\nefforts to address social and traditional mindsets that \r\nlead to human rights abuses and poverty and steps \r\ntaken to make cooperation between State institutions \r\nand civil society groups more productive. \r\n Our delegation also outlined the challenges \r\nfacing the Government, particularly in the promotion \r\nof economic and social rights, including the areas of \r\neducation, health and employment, and accepted most \r\nof the recommendations of the UPR Working Group. \r\nThe Government is committed to ensuring the \r\nimplementation of these recommendations. \r\n Ghana attaches great importance to the UPR \r\nmechanism and believes that it provides an effective \r\nmeans for achieving progress towards greater \r\nresponsibility for human rights. Within this context, it \r\nis worth noting the important lessons that can be drawn \r\nfrom the first sessions of the review exercise, including \r\nthe need for States making recommendations to take \r\ninto consideration the constitutional developments and \r\ncultural specificities of the States under review. \r\n It is also necessary for the Council to abide by the \r\nguiding principles set out in the institution-building \r\ntext to ensure universality, transparency, objectivity \r\nand non-selectiveness in the consideration of human \r\nrights matters. Such an approach will prevent the \r\nselective and discriminatory practices that discredited \r\nthe former Commission, ensure the credibility of the \r\nCouncil and strengthen the degree of commitment by \r\nStates. \r\n In order to maintain the cooperative spirit \r\nachieved in the initial reviews, we advise the Council \r\nto avoid subtle attempts to pressure States to report on \r\nthe implementation of the recommendations of the \r\nUPR prior to the completion of the four-year period \r\nstipulated in the institution-building package. In this \r\nregard, the Council’s work programme should promote \r\nonly the voluntary reporting by States of the \r\ncommitments they have undertaken during the review \r\nprior to the scheduled four-year cycle.  \r\n It is our view that, even though the institution-\r\nbuilding process was completed in the Council’s \r\nsecond cycle, which ended in June 2008, and despite \r\nthe fact that the implementation phase has commenced \r\nwith the third cycle which began in September 2008, \r\nthe Council’s work can benefit from the fine-tuning of \r\nits work programme to facilitate the smooth \r\nfunctioning of its working methods. \r\n It is our expectation that the UPR will develop \r\ninto a meaningful mechanism complementing other \r\nactivities of the Council related to country situations \r\nand to bring real added value to its work. \r\n The Human Rights Council has made appreciable \r\nprogress. However, it remains crucial for the Council \r\nto continue to fulfil effectively its mandate and address \r\nand prevent situations of human rights violations \r\nworldwide. Ghana pledges to work with all \r\nstakeholders to create a strong, effective and efficient \r\nbody capable of promoting and protecting human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms for all. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): It is with dismay and \r\ndisappointment that I address this gathering of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Today, we consider the second \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/63/53 and \r\nAdd.1), a report that reflects how far the Council has \r\ndrifted from its founding principles of impartiality, \r\nuniversality, non-selectivity and objectivity. \r\n Sometimes tragedy is not just the pain we suffer, \r\nbut the opportunities we miss. And today’s report is a \r\nclear demonstration of the opportunities missed by the \r\nHuman Rights Council and, may I say, by the \r\ninternational community as a whole. We all witness a \r\nUnited Nations human rights body targeting Israel in \r\nan obsessive and discriminatory fashion. We can only \r\nwatch in disbelief as the Council ignores human rights \r\nabuses around the world while offering silence at best \r\nand praise at worst to some of the world’s most \r\nruthless, abusive dictators. \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n17 08-58567 \r\n \r\n Since we considered last year’s report, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has adopted a series of seven \r\nresolutions condemning Israel. No other country \r\namong the other 191 members of the United Nations is \r\nthe target of such negative and unreasoned attention. \r\nEach pronouncement against Israel lacks any \r\nsemblance of objectivity — objectivity that the Council \r\nis supposedly based upon. Furthermore, this past year \r\nwitnessed another one-sided special session against \r\nIsrael, bringing the total number of special sessions \r\ntargeting Israel to four. That is more than the number \r\nof all other special sessions combined. Certain \r\nmembers of the Council appear intoxicated with the \r\nautomatic majority they enjoy as they abuse the \r\nCouncil’s procedures and mechanisms. \r\n As we consider today’s report (A/63/53 and \r\nAdd.1), I call upon each and every member of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to pause for a moment and, in a \r\nspirit of honesty, ask himself or herself why Israel \r\nreceives such disparate treatment. Is the Council’s \r\nbehaviour towards Israel truly about combating human \r\nrights abuses in the world? Or is this treatment a \r\nreflection of the political dynamics of the Council and \r\nof the larger United Nations community? The answer \r\nto those questions is very clear. \r\n As a democracy, Israel does not seek to hide its \r\nhuman rights performance, nor should any other State. \r\nIn fact, Israel is proud of its efforts to uphold the \r\nfounding principles of the United Nations and to \r\nengage in constructive debates and dialogues. Yet \r\nIsrael will not sit idly by and acquiesce as the Human \r\nRights Council eschews the principles of balance and \r\nfairness. Israel will not remain silent as the Council \r\nprejudges the outcome of its findings and determines in \r\nadvance Israel’s culpability in a cynical and methodical \r\nmanner. \r\n While the one-sided resolutions and special \r\nsessions that target Israel are grave cause for concern \r\nfor the credibility of the Council, the institutional \r\nframework established against Israel by the Council \r\nthreatens its very integrity and legitimacy. Israel is the \r\nsubject of the Council’s only country-specific agenda \r\nitem. The continued obsession with Israel serves to \r\ndivert the attention of the Human Rights Council from \r\nlegitimate human rights abuses around the world, and \r\nsuch politicization of the human rights agenda \r\ndemonstrates the Council’s commitment to political \r\npoint-scoring, rather than to the real protection of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Furthermore, the Council clings to the mandate of \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights \r\nin the Palestinian territories. That mandate presumes \r\nIsraeli violations and precludes the Special Rapporteur \r\nfrom discussing honestly human rights in a holistic and \r\nimpartial manner. Palestinian terrorism that \r\ndeliberately targets Israeli civilians thus receives \r\nimmunity. How can the Special Rapporteur claim, for \r\nexample, to act in the name of human rights when his \r\nmandate systematically prohibits the discussion of \r\nindiscriminate Qassam rocket attacks on the civilians \r\nof Sderot and Ashkelon? How can the Special \r\nRapporteur claim to uphold universal values of human \r\nrights when he remains deafeningly silent as Hamas \r\nviolates the most basic human rights of its own people? \r\n Compounding that unbalanced mandate is the fact \r\nthat, despite the requirement of the constitutive \r\ndocument that established the Human Rights Council, \r\nthe Special Rapporteur’s mandate has not been \r\nreviewed or scrutinized for over 15 years since its \r\ncreation in 1993. The absence of any review is not for \r\nlack of opportunity, as the mandate was scheduled to \r\nbe reviewed in March and September of this year. Yet \r\non both occasions, the Council evaded its duty. Even \r\nthe Special Rapporteur himself publicly called for the \r\nmandate to be reviewed and updated. \r\n There are millions of people across the world \r\nwho live under the yoke of oppression and who cry out \r\nfor the protection of the Human Rights Council. The \r\nCouncil itself was created to hear those pleas, to offer a \r\nbrighter alternative to the world’s most \r\ndisenfranchised, but for political reasons the Council’s \r\nobsession with Israel stands in the way of its true \r\npotential.  \r\n The report we consider today reflects a Human \r\nRights Council that continues to fail to uphold the \r\nbasic standards of human rights in an impartial, \r\nuniversal, non-selective and objective manner. In a \r\nyear when the world is celebrating the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, the work of the Human Rights Council casts a \r\ndark shadow on the commitment of the international \r\ncommunity to the true principles of human rights. \r\n Mr. Malginov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We wish to convey our gratitude to \r\nAmbassador Martin Uhomoibhi, President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, for having presented his report \r\n(A/63/53 and Add.1).  \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 18 \r\n \r\n The creation of the Human Rights Council was an \r\nimportant stage in the ongoing reform of the United \r\nNations. We are convinced that the transformation of \r\nthe main intergovernmental human rights body of the \r\nUnited Nations system from a functional commission \r\nof the Economic and Social Council into a subsidiary \r\nbody of the General Assembly was a significant step \r\ntowards recognizing the importance of human rights \r\nissues and their rightful place among the \r\nOrganization’s priorities. We believe that, in the course \r\nof the upcoming review of the Council’s activities, \r\nthere will be a need to systematically assess the \r\nstrengths and weaknesses of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s Special Procedures and mechanisms in order \r\nto adopt the necessary decisions on changing or \r\nclarifying the status, mandate, composition, agenda and \r\nprogramme of work of that body.  \r\n It is very important that the process of analysing \r\nthe early results of the Council’s work should begin \r\nnow, in the year of the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, when all of us are thinking about how to make \r\nthe United Nations human rights mechanism more \r\neffective and responsive to the needs of all the peoples \r\nof the world and all individuals. \r\n In our view, one of the most important functions \r\nthat the Council is called upon to undertake in \r\ncompliance with the provisions of resolution 60/251, is \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review of the human rights \r\nsituation in States Members of the United Nations. \r\nRussia backed the creation of that procedure in the \r\nhope that such a review on an equal and mutually \r\nrespectful basis would help to lessen confrontation in \r\nintergovernmental cooperation on human rights.  \r\n We are convinced that, in the future, the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review will have to fully replace \r\nthe seriously discredited practice of introducing one-\r\nsided and politicized country-specific resolutions on \r\nhuman rights situations in individual States. At the \r\nsame time, we reaffirm the need to strictly comply with \r\nexisting intergovernmental agreements on modalities \r\nfor conducting the Review, including on the issue of \r\nincluding various categories of participants in the \r\nprocess.  \r\n One of the most important instruments through \r\nwhich the Human Rights Council discharges its \r\nmandate is the system of Specialized Procedures \r\ninherited by the Council from the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights. Unfortunately, along with their clear \r\nbenefits, the Specialized Procedures also possess a \r\nnumber of shortcomings that have been legitimately \r\ncriticized. \r\n In that respect, it is with satisfaction that we note \r\nthat, during the two years since the creation of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, that system underwent a \r\nprocess of critical re-thinking and was \r\ninstitutionalized. An important outcome of that process \r\nwas the bringing of the main human rights monitoring \r\nactivities into line with the parameters of the Council’s \r\nmandate. The functioning of human rights mechanisms \r\nis now evolving towards depoliticization. A guarantee \r\nof that was the adoption of the Code of Conduct for \r\nSpecial Procedures upon the initiative of member \r\nStates in the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly. We cherish the hope that the further \r\ndevelopment of that system will continue in the same \r\ndirection. \r\n The institutionalization of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil was accompanied by the establishment of new \r\nforms of relations between Governments and civil \r\nsociety, without which the Council would not be in a \r\nposition to fulfil its potential. The Russian Federation \r\nhopes that the basis for the Council’s interaction with \r\nhuman rights non-governmental organizations will be \r\nthe principles of mutual responsibility and constructive \r\ndialogue.  \r\n The Russian Federation supports initiatives aimed \r\nat a more active participation of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in reviewing the main areas of activity of the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nincluding issues related to planning, implementing and \r\nrationalizing leading programmes at the global, \r\nregional and country levels. We are convinced that \r\ncooperation between the Council and the Office must \r\nbe transparent and provide clear reciprocity.  \r\n With regard to better Office and Council \r\nmanagement, we also believe that the same principles \r\nshould be enforced as those that were enforced \r\nbetween the Office and the former Commission on \r\nHuman Rights, including accountability. We base that \r\nopinion on the fact that the provisions of resolution \r\n48/141, especially the section concerning the \r\nCommission’s mandate, are by analogy applied to the \r\nmandate of the Council. More generally, the final \r\nobjective of those efforts and cooperation must be to \r\navoid duplication of efforts between all the \r\n A/63/PV.38\r\n \r\n19 08-58567 \r\n \r\ncomponents of the United Nations system in the field \r\nof human rights, which in turn should not compete with \r\neach other but complement each other.  \r\n The Vienna Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction reaffirmed the principle of the equality of all \r\nhuman rights and their interrelation, interdependence \r\nand mutual complementarity. In that respect, we would \r\nlike to again urge the Human Rights Council to devote \r\nequal attention in its activities to all categories of \r\nhuman rights, norms and standards. We are convinced \r\nthat that principle must be fundamental in determining \r\nthe priorities and programmes of work of the Council \r\nin the near and long-term future.  \r\n We believe that the Council should devote \r\nadditional attention to a number of other conceptual \r\nissues, including the intercivilizational and \r\nintercultural element in the activities of the United \r\nNations overall. We find it quite justifiable that the \r\nleading intergovernmental human rights body should \r\naddress the issue of the relationship and impact of \r\nhuman rights, norms and standards on traditional \r\nvalues. We are convinced that universal standards in \r\nthe field of human rights should draw their inspiration \r\nfrom various civilizations and the cultural and \r\nhistorical traditions of various societies. That is what \r\nunites us rather than divides us in our commitment to \r\nhuman rights, and we believe that a sound basis for \r\nsuch an approach was established by the Council’s \r\nspecial session in March of this year.  \r\n The Human Rights Council is only at the very \r\nfirst stage of its institutionalization. Whether it meets \r\nthe hopes and faith placed in it depends largely on us, \r\nthe Member States. A guarantee of success will lie in \r\nour readiness to listen to each other, to take into \r\naccount and respect other’s views and to implement the \r\ndecisions that we ourselves have adopted. We urge \r\nMember States and representatives of civil society to \r\nbear that in mind in order to turn the Human Rights \r\nCouncil into a genuinely effective and efficient body. \r\n Mr. Pak Tok Hun (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): The international community \r\nestablished the Human Rights Council as a new organ \r\nin the hope that it would deal with the human rights \r\nissues of every country on an equal footing, through \r\nconstructive dialogue and cooperation, discarding the \r\nshortcomings of its predecessor body, the Commission \r\non Human Rights, in which confrontation, \r\npoliticization, selectivity and double standards were \r\nrampant.  \r\n It was with that vision in mind that the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism, now operational within \r\nthe Council, was established. The Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, like many other countries, expected \r\nthat the Universal Periodic Review mechanism process \r\nwould develop into a meaningful mechanism, doing \r\naway with controversial country-specific resolutions.  \r\n However, the Council fails to meet the \r\nexpectations of a vast majority of Member States by \r\nrepeating the same mistakes of selectivity and double \r\nstandards that paralysed the work of the former \r\nCommission on Human Rights. It has become apparent \r\nthat a growing number of countries are opposed to \r\npolitically motivated country-specific resolutions, \r\nwhich have nothing to do with the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights but seek to incite distrust \r\nand confrontation among States. \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\nalways been opposed to country-specific resolutions, \r\nwhich are used only for the political purposes of \r\ncertain countries or groups of countries. Regrettably, \r\nhowever, a stereotypical resolution on our country was \r\nadopted by the Council at its seventh session this past \r\nMarch, in defiance of the repeated calls by a large \r\nnumber of member States to discontinue the adoption \r\nof country-specific resolutions. \r\n My delegation resolutely rejects resolution 7/15, \r\ncontained in the report of the Human Rights Council as \r\ncontradictory to the mission, purposes and methods of \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council. The adoption of \r\nsuch a resolution is the most vivid manifestation of the \r\nact of politicization, selectivity and double standards. \r\nThe resolution is close to paralysing the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism of the Council, the \r\nfunction of which is to handle human rights situations \r\nin all countries on an equal footing, as the resolution \r\ncalls for retaining the post of special rapporteur for an \r\nindividual country, a vestige of the already defunct \r\nHuman Rights Commission. \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nrespects international human rights bodies and attaches \r\nimportance to their activities. However, it does not and \r\ncannot accept any sort of discriminatory treatment \r\nwhatsoever by human rights organs. The resolution \r\nwill only succeed in obstructing cooperation between \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nA/63/PV.38  \r\n \r\n08-58567 20 \r\n \r\nHuman Rights Council and aggravating the mistrust \r\nand confrontation between them. The sponsors of the \r\nresolution will be held fully accountable for all the \r\nunpredictable consequences. \r\n The future of the Human Rights Council will \r\ndepend on how it can meet the expectations of States in \r\nterms of non-politicization, impartiality and \r\nnon-selectivity in its activities. The Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will continue to firmly \r\nguarantee the fundamental freedoms and rights of its \r\ncitizens, both legally and in practice, on the basis of \r\nthe people-centred Juche idea, and will make active \r\ncontributions to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights worldwide. \r\n Mr. Soler Torrijos (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for his introduction of the \r\nCouncil’s report to the General Assembly (A/63/53 and \r\nAdd.1). We think that it is very important to continue \r\nreviewing the performance of the Council within the \r\nAssembly. The Charter of this Organization requires \r\nthat its Members promote respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms without discrimination as to \r\nrace, gender, language or religion. Along with all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, Panama \r\nundertook that obligation and reiterates its firm \r\ncommitment to it.  \r\n In our view, the Human Rights Council is the \r\nmultilateral forum that, par excellence, must concern \r\nitself with infringements of human rights, including \r\nserious and systematic violations, as well as making \r\nrecommendations in that respect. Panama believes that, \r\nrather than punishing human rights violations, \r\nconstructive dialogue and cooperation must take \r\nprecedence, so as to prevent those violations. Although \r\nthe principal responsibility lies with the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, in order to guarantee the effectiveness of its \r\nrecommendations it is necessary to incorporate human \r\nrights into the general activities of the United Nations \r\nsystem and achieve their effective coordination.  \r\n It is crucial that the Human Rights Council avoid \r\nexcessive politicization and favouring interests  \r\n \r\nextraneous to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, which damaged the credibility of its predecessor, \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights. In its work, the \r\nCouncil must be guided by the principles of universality, \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. In that \r\nregard, Panama is concerned by proposals aimed at \r\nweakening or eliminating the Special Procedures that \r\ncould undermine the Council’s ability to function \r\neffectively and independently. We encourage the \r\nmembers of that body to use the review of the Special \r\nProcedures to strengthen the system so that it is better \r\nequipped to support the Council in the protection of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Despite criticism of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, my delegation should like to highlight some \r\nvaluable practices in exercising the Review. In \r\nparticular, we underscore the positive and novel \r\npractice of involving public and private actors in \r\npreparing the report of each State. We emphasize that \r\nhigh-level officials and experts in various fields of \r\nhuman rights have contributed to the Review of \r\nMember States. In our opinion, that reflects the \r\nimportance and seriousness that Member States \r\nattribute to that exercise. Similarly, we welcome the \r\nCouncil’s decision to assign the necessary funds for its \r\nexecution, a step that will guarantee the impartiality of \r\nthat Review.  \r\n We hope that the Human Rights Council will \r\ncontinue to develop in the near future. As Member \r\nStates, we have the responsibility to ensure that that is \r\nthe case. It is still a young body. Its successful \r\ndevelopment for the good of all the world’s inhabitants \r\ndepends on our cooperation. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 58 without prejudice to \r\nsubsequent consideration of the report of the Third \r\nCommittee on the same subject. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
