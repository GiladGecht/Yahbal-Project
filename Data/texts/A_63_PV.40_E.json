The \r\nAssembly will now proceed to vote with respect to the \r\nremaining vacancy.  \r\n Once again, I should like to remind representatives \r\nthat, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,  \r\n  “After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.” \r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers \r\nwill now be distributed.  \r\n All the candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot paper are eligible. The names of the four \r\ncandidates who have already obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes, that is, Mr. Ronny Abraham, \r\nMr. Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, Mr. Antônio Augusto \r\nCançado Trindade and Mr. Christopher Greenwood, \r\nhave been deleted from the ballot. May I remind \r\ndelegations that the name of only one candidate should \r\nbe marked with a cross. Any ballot paper on which \r\nmore than one name is marked will be considered \r\ninvalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names \r\nappear on the ballot papers. \r\n  At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Noni Ismi \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Ms. Yuliana Georgieva \r\n(Bulgaria), Miss Sheree Chambers (Jamaica), \r\nMr. Paul Ballantyne (New Zealand), Mr. Saidu \r\nDodo (Nigeria) and Ms. Louise Ahldén (Sweden) \r\nacted as tellers. \r\n \r\n  A vote was taken by secret ballot.  \r\n \r\nThe meeting was suspended at 12.35 p.m. and resumed \r\nat 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   192 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   192 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of members voting:  192 \r\nRequired absolute majority:  97 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia) 74 \r\n Ms. Miriam Defensor-Santiago \r\n (Philippines)    71 \r\n Mr. Maurice Kamto (Cameroon) 44 \r\n Mr. Sayeman Bula-Bula (Democratic \r\n Republic of the Congo)  3 \r\nA/63/PV.40  \r\n \r\n08-59117 2 \r\n \r\n In view of the lateness of the hour, and since no \r\ncandidate obtained an absolute majority in the previous \r\nround of balloting, further balloting will be postponed \r\nuntil 3 o’clock this afternoon.  \r\nThe meeting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at \r\n3.20 p.m. with Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica), Vice-President, in \r\nthe Chair. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that, \r\nat the end of the two rounds of balloting conducted this \r\nmorning, one candidate remained to be elected. The \r\nAssembly will now proceed to vote with respect to the \r\nremaining vacancy. \r\n Once again, I should like to remind representatives \r\nthat, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,  \r\n  “After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.” \r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers \r\nwill now be distributed. \r\n All the candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot paper are eligible. The names of the four \r\ncandidates who have already obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes — Mr. Ronny Abraham, Mr. Awn \r\nShawkat Al-Khasawneh, Mr. Antônio Augusto Cançado \r\nTrindade and Mr. Christopher Greenwood — have been \r\ndeleted from the ballot. May I remind delegations that \r\nthe name of only one candidate should be marked with \r\na cross. Any ballot paper on which more than one name \r\nis marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast \r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot \r\npapers. \r\n  At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Noni Ismi \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Ms. Yuliana Georgieva \r\n(Bulgaria), Miss Sheree Chambers (Jamaica), \r\nMr. Paul Ballantyne (New Zealand), Mr. Saidu \r\nDodo (Nigeria) and Ms. Louise Ahldén (Sweden) \r\nacted as tellers. \r\n \r\n  A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was suspended at 3.30 p.m. and resumed at \r\n3.55 p.m. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   188 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   188 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of members voting:  188 \r\nRequired absolute majority:  97 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia) 90 \r\n Ms. Miriam Defensor-Santiago \r\n (Philippines)    67 \r\n Mr. Maurice Kamto (Cameroon) 29 \r\n Mr. Sayeman Bula-Bula (Democratic \r\n Republic of the Congo)  2 \r\n Since no candidate has received an absolute \r\nmajority in the previous round of balloting, the \r\nAssembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to \r\nfill the remaining vacancy. \r\n Mr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo) \r\n(spoke in French): I would like to inform the Assembly \r\nthat the Democratic Republic of the Congo has decided \r\nto withdraw Mr. Sayeman Bula-Bula’s candidature. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to express to all the \r\ndelegations that have supported us our gratitude and \r\nappreciation. I would like to call on those delegations \r\nto continue to give us their support in order to enable \r\nthe General Assembly to ensure that the great forms of \r\ncivilization and the principal legal systems of the world \r\nare represented within that august United Nations body, \r\nthe International Court of Justice. \r\n The Acting President: Members have heard the \r\nstatement by the representative of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo that that delegation no longer \r\nwishes their candidate to be considered.  \r\n Taking into consideration the statement just \r\nmade, we shall therefore proceed to the current \r\nunrestricted ballot, and the name of Mr. Sayeman Bula-\r\nBula will be deleted from the next ballot paper. \r\nMembers should remember that, for this round, any \r\nvote for Sayeman Bula-Bula will not be counted.  \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French): \r\nWould you be kind enough, Sir, to explain to us on the \r\nbasis of which article and rule you now invite us to \r\nproceed as you have suggested? I would be grateful if \r\nyou could do so, because if I refer, for example, to rule \r\n150 of the General Assembly rules of procedure, it \r\nsays: \r\n A/63/PV.40\r\n \r\n3 08-59117 \r\n \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n  “The election of the members of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice shall take place in \r\naccordance with the Statute of the Court.”  \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nSo I would like to know upon which article you are \r\nbasing the modus operandi you have just suggested, \r\nSir. \r\n* * * \r\n The Acting President: I apologize for the delay. \r\nIn response to the point that was raised by my \r\ncolleague the representative of Guinea-Bissau, I give \r\nthe floor to the representative of the Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): Articles 11 and 12 of \r\nthe Statute of the International Court of Justice, which \r\ngovern the procedure for elections, do not make \r\nspecific reference to the process of the withdrawal of \r\ncandidates. However, in keeping with the long and \r\nwell-established practice of the Assembly, in the light \r\nof the fact that candidates are nominated by national \r\ngroups of Member States, the withdrawal of \r\nnominations may also occur at any point leading up to \r\nthe election, in accordance with Article 5 of the Statute \r\nof the International Court of Justice.  \r\n Since the candidate from the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo was nominated by one national group — \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo — its request \r\nfor withdrawal is certified by the General Assembly \r\nand is in accordance with Assembly practice. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French): I \r\nnever wanted to question the sovereign decision of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to withdraw its \r\ncandidate. That was not my question. But since the \r\nrepresentative of the Secretariat has referred to, among \r\nothers, Article 12, I would like to read out Article 12 of \r\nthe Statute of the International Court of Justice, which \r\nstates, in paragraph 1, that: \r\n  “If, after the third meeting, one or more \r\nseats still remain unfilled, a joint conference \r\nconsisting of six members, three appointed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly and three by the Security \r\nCouncil, may be formed at any time at the request \r\nof either the General Assembly or the Security \r\nCouncil, for the purpose of choosing by the vote \r\nof an absolute majority one name for each seat \r\nstill vacant, to submit to the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council for their respective \r\nacceptance.”  \r\nThen it refers to the joint conference. That is what \r\nArticle 12 states. Article 12 does not refer to the \r\nsovereign right of a State to withdraw, at its pleasure, \r\nits candidate. \r\n The Acting President: I thank the representative \r\nof Guinea-Bissau for the clarification. I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of the Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I would like to make \r\nreference to Article 11 of the Statute of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, which states: \r\n  “If, after the first meeting held for the \r\npurpose of the election, one or more seats remain \r\nto be filled, a second and, if necessary, a third \r\nmeeting shall take place.” \r\n The General Assembly is now only in the second \r\nmeeting. We are not in the third meeting, because \r\nduring the first meeting we obtained more than the \r\nnecessary number of candidates that fulfilled the \r\nrequirement for an absolute majority. That was the first \r\nmeeting. Then we started the second meeting, and that \r\nwas announced. The subsequent reconvening was not a \r\nnew meeting, but a resumed meeting. We are now still \r\nin the second meeting. We did not adjourn the meeting \r\nin the morning; we closed the first meeting after the \r\nfirst ballot. Now we are still in the second meeting of \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to \r\nCameroon on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): This is not exactly a point of order. I have not \r\nheard an answer to the question asked. We had two \r\nmeetings this morning, because the President opened a \r\nfirst meeting, and he said “The meeting is adjourned” \r\nand we had a second meeting. We are now, this \r\nafternoon, in the third meeting.  \r\n At this third meeting, the voting has not been \r\nconcluded. As a result, we have used up all our \r\nmeetings and we are in the situation described by the \r\nrepresentative of Guinea-Bissau. We are already in the \r\nthird meeting. We have reached the end of the third \r\nmeeting and the vote did not reach a conclusion.  \r\nA/63/PV.40  \r\n \r\n08-59117 4 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I am afraid that the \r\ninterpretation of the representative of Cameroon is not \r\ncorrect, but I will allow the representative of the \r\nSecretariat to explain in the same manner that it was \r\nexplained to my colleague from Guinea-Bissau. I give \r\nthe floor once again to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat, who will very carefully explain what has \r\nstarted, what has finished and what has recommenced. \r\nI will not attempt to do so. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): Let me read from the \r\nPresident’s notes for the 39th meeting, the first plenary \r\nmeeting held this morning: \r\n  “In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1 \r\nof the Statute of the Court, those candidates who \r\nobtain an absolute majority of votes both in the \r\nGeneral Assembly and in the Security Council \r\nshall be considered as elected.  \r\n  “Pursuant to rule 151 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the Assembly, if in the first ballot \r\nthe number of candidates obtaining an absolute \r\nmajority is less than five, the Assembly will \r\nproceed … to a second ballot to fill the remaining \r\nvacancies, until five candidates have obtained the \r\nrequired majority.”  \r\n By way of explanation as to the previous practice, \r\nthe notes read: \r\n  “At its 915th meeting, on 16 November \r\n1960, the General Assembly decided that ballots \r\nshall be unrestricted. That decision has been \r\nfollowed consistently. \r\n  “I should like to bring another matter to the \r\nattention of the General Assembly. Cases have \r\narisen in the Security Council in which more than \r\nthe required number of candidates has obtained \r\nan absolute majority on the same ballot. The \r\nsame also occurred in the General Assembly, at \r\nthe 44th plenary meeting of the sixtieth session, \r\non 7 November 2005. \r\n  “Both organs decided to hold a new ballot \r\non all the candidates, and no notification to the \r\nPresident of the other organ was made until only \r\nthe required number of candidates, and no more, \r\nhad obtained an absolute majority.” \r\n After the first ballot, four candidates — actually, \r\nfive candidates — obtained the absolute majority. That \r\nwas one meeting. An exchange between the President \r\nof the General Assembly and the President of the \r\nSecurity Council was made. Those four candidates that \r\nobtained the absolute majority both in the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council were elected. That \r\nmeeting was adjourned and such adjournment was \r\nannounced by the President. I would now like to quote \r\nfrom the President’s closing words at the adjournment \r\nof the first meeting this morning: \r\n  “In accordance with the provisions of \r\nArticle 11 of the Statute of the Court, it will be \r\nnecessary to hold another meeting to fill the \r\nremaining vacancy.  \r\n  “I propose that the present meeting be \r\nadjourned and that the 40th meeting should be \r\nheld immediately to vote on the remaining \r\nvacancy.”  \r\n The meeting was adjourned and the next meeting, \r\nthe 40th meeting, was reconvened immediately, in \r\nparallel between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council concluded its \r\nmeeting. The General Assembly did not conclude its \r\n40th meeting, since none of the candidates obtained the \r\nnecessary absolute majority. We are therefore \r\ncontinuing with the same meeting until one of the \r\ndelegates obtains an absolute majority.  \r\n The Security Council has already held its meeting \r\nand, as soon as the Assembly gets five candidates with \r\nan absolute majority, the exchange of letters between \r\nthe President of the Security Council and the President \r\nof the General Assembly will occur. If those candidates \r\nare the same, then the election is over. If those \r\ncandidates are not the same, the Assembly and the \r\nCouncil will go into a third meeting. I hope that \r\nclarifies the situation. \r\n The Acting President: Having thought we settled \r\nthe issue, I now reluctantly give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Guinea-Bissau. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau): This matter is a \r\nserious one. It is not a joke. I apologize to any delegate \r\nhere who believes otherwise. It is not joke. We are not \r\nasking for the floor or taking it just for the purpose of \r\nmerely speaking. We are not here to distract or to \r\nentertain anybody.  \r\n I just want to ask a simple question: which \r\nmeeting is this? Is this the second meeting? Or is this \r\nthe third meeting? This is a simple question, after \r\n A/63/PV.40\r\n \r\n5 08-59117 \r\n \r\nwhich we will know where we are. Because if you go \r\nback to rule 151 of the rules of procedure of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Sir, it tells you what we should do. \r\nI just want to know which meeting this is.  \r\n We had the first meeting and we elected four \r\ncandidates because those four obtained an absolute \r\nmajority in both the Security Council and in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and they were declared to be \r\nelected. Then we had the second meeting. As I \r\nunderstand it, we just had a third meeting. But if that is \r\nnot the case, please explain it to me. Then, if we have \r\nto challenge you, Sir, or the Secretariat, we will. But \r\nplease, just tell us whether the official record will show \r\nthat the Secretariat declared that we were in the second \r\nor the third meeting. That is all that I am asking.  \r\n The Acting President: I just want to ask \r\neverybody to remain calm. I assure the representative \r\nof Guinea-Bissau that I did not interpret any rules to \r\ndetermine what meetings we were in. I gave the floor \r\nto the Secretariat. The representative of the Secretariat \r\ndid come to explain which meeting we were in.  \r\n On the basis of the explanations made by the \r\nSecretariat, I thought the representative of Guinea-\r\nBissau was satisfied. Then, at the request of the \r\nrepresentative of Cameroon, the Secretariat went back \r\nto get the transcript from this morning. I took it that the \r\nrepresentative of Cameroon was satisfied with the \r\nreading out of that transcript. If that is not the case, I \r\nwould ask that he so clarify, because I thought that the \r\nexplanation of the Secretariat had been satisfactory. If \r\nnot, then we will just continue the meeting until \r\nwhenever we are able to hold a ballot. As I am merely \r\nsitting in for President d’Escoto Brockmann, there is \r\nno need to challenge me, please.  \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): Pursuant to this \r\ndiscussion, I would like to lodge a parliamentary \r\ninquiry. Whether this meeting is the first or the second, \r\nI am not even sure. But the fact of the matter remains \r\nthat, under the rules, when there is an inadequate \r\nnumber of candidates who have obtained absolute \r\nmajorities in the voting, that same meeting may \r\ncontinue by way of different ballots. A distinction must \r\nbe made between meetings and balloting, so there can \r\nbe a second balloting, a third balloting, a fourth \r\nballoting, still within the first meeting.  \r\n Now my inquiry is — and I have here before me \r\nthe document that was released to us, namely \r\nA/63/186 — whether we are still governed by paragraph \r\n11 of that document, which I will now read out: \r\n  “At the 915th plenary meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, on 16 November 1960, a \r\nprocedural discussion was held as to whether rule \r\n94 (then rule 96) of the rules of procedure of the \r\nAssembly should be applied in elections to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. That rule lays \r\ndown a procedure for restricted ballots in the \r\nevent that, after the first ballot, the requisite \r\nnumber of candidates have not obtained the \r\nrequired majority. By 47 votes to 27, with 25 \r\nabstentions, the Assembly decided that the rule \r\ndid not apply to elections to the Court and \r\nproceeded to elect the requisite number of \r\ncandidates by a series of unrestricted ballots. That \r\ndecision has been followed consistently.”  \r\n I shall continue with paragraph 12 of document \r\nA/63/186:  \r\n  “Accordingly, if in the first ballot in either \r\nthe General Assembly or the Security Council, \r\nthe number of candidates obtaining an absolute \r\nmajority is less than five, a second ballot will be \r\nheld and balloting will continue at the same \r\nmeeting until five candidates have obtained the \r\nrequired majority (rule 151 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the Assembly and rule 61 of the \r\nprovisional rules of procedure of the Council).”  \r\n Now, if we apply paragraphs 11 and 12 that I \r\nhave just read, and assuming that we have approved \r\nthis — because the same was read by the President this \r\nmorning, it would appear to me that the same was \r\nadopted. What the result would therefore be is that an \r\nannouncement of the results only for winning \r\ncandidates cannot be binding, because there should \r\nhave been an unrestricted second balloting until five \r\ncandidates had been elected.  \r\n That, then, is my point of inquiry, namely, \r\nwhether that is the rule. It seems that the Philippines is \r\nsupported by those paragraphs 11 and 12. There cannot \r\nbe an announcement of four elected members in any \r\nround of balloting if five had not obtained the required \r\nmajority. It is necessary that in any announcement of \r\nwinning candidates there must be five winners. \r\n The Acting President: With the indulgence of \r\nthe Assembly, I have been asked by the Secretariat to \r\nA/63/PV.40  \r\n \r\n08-59117 6 \r\n \r\nsuspend the meeting for 10 minutes or so, while they \r\nconsult with the delegations concerned.  \r\nThe meeting was suspended at 4.35 p.m. and resumed \r\nat 5 p.m. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I call on the representative \r\nof the Secretariat for a final, hopefully, clarification, \r\nafter which I propose to proceed to the balloting. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): As I mentioned earlier, \r\nand as the President of the General Assembly was \r\nfollowing, we started today with the 39th meeting of \r\nthe Assembly. The result of the ballot was that five \r\ncandidates got an absolute majority. The Security \r\nCouncil held its plenary meeting in parallel. Letters \r\nfrom both Presidents were exchanged on the results of \r\nthe election in the Security Council and those of the \r\nelection in the General Assembly.  \r\n Four candidates were the same in the results of \r\nthe election in the plenary and in those of the election \r\nin the Security Council. The President of the General \r\nAssembly announced, as I read out earlier, that since \r\nwe do not have five candidates that match in the \r\nelections in the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, we will proceed with the second meeting of \r\nthe Assembly.  \r\n The President adjourned the 39th meeting and \r\nimmediately opened the 40th meeting of the General \r\nAssembly. The same was done simultaneously by the \r\nSecurity Council. We proceeded to another ballot. As a \r\nresult, none of the remaining candidates — we were \r\nvoting to elect one candidate — got the required \r\nabsolute majority, 97 votes, though in the Security \r\nCouncil the vote was conclusive.  \r\n In order to match the results in the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, the Assembly has \r\nto continue the same meeting to proceed with other \r\nballots. The 40th meeting, in which we are now, should \r\ncontinue until we have a candidate with an absolute \r\nmajority. After that result, the Presidents of the two \r\nbodies will exchange letters and give the names of the \r\ncandidates. If the result matches, the election is over. If \r\nnot, the General Assembly will have a third meeting. \r\nThe Security Council will do the same. That is in \r\naccordance with Article 11 of the Statute of the Court:  \r\n  “If, after the first meeting held for the \r\npurpose of the election, one or more seats remain \r\nto be filled, a second and, if necessary, a third \r\nmeeting shall take place.”  \r\n If the voting is still inconclusive at the third \r\nmeeting, or the results at the third meeting in the \r\nSecurity Council and in the General Assembly are not \r\nthe same, then we shall implement Article 12. \r\n The Acting President: We shall now begin the \r\nvoting process. Ballot papers will now be distributed. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of Cameroon \r\non a point of order. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): There are two issues. If the same meeting \r\ncontinues and a candidate withdraws, it cannot be the \r\nsame meeting. That is the first point. \r\n Secondly, when we asked the question, Sir, that \r\nyou clarified, we asked for the Legal Counsel to come \r\nand answer it, so that the issue is fully recorded in the \r\nverbatim records and this confusion does not arise \r\nagain in the future. So ask the Legal Counsel to come \r\nand clarify the issue once and for all. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): The practice of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and even in elections in other \r\nprincipal bodies, is that if a Member State withdraws a \r\ncandidature, it does not mean the Assembly ends the \r\nmeeting and then starts another meeting. We have this \r\nin elections in the Security Council, too. The number \r\nof the meeting is the same.  \r\n The only difference is that if a Member State \r\nwithdraws its candidature in the election for the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, all those national groups \r\nthat recommended that candidate should support the \r\nwithdrawal of the candidate. Since the candidate of the \r\nMember State that requested its candidate be \r\nwithdrawn was supported only by its own national \r\ngroup, we consider that that is a correct request. No \r\nother support is needed, and thus the General Assembly \r\ncan proceed and withdraw that candidature from the \r\nlist for the ballot. \r\n The Acting President: We shall now begin the \r\nvoting process. Ballot papers will now be distributed. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of Cameroon \r\non a point of order. \r\n A/63/PV.40\r\n \r\n7 08-59117 \r\n \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I agree with you, Sir, and I ask you to believe \r\nthat I do not wish to delay this meeting unduly. But the \r\nLegal Counsel should come and say all that, so that it \r\nappears in the verbatim records. That was my other \r\nrequest. \r\n The Acting President: I would like to point out \r\nthe lateness of the hour to my friend and colleague. At \r\nthis point, we do not know if we will be able to obtain \r\nan explanation from the Legal Counsel, but it would \r\nmean that the meeting would have to be suspended and \r\nrisk going closer to 6 p.m. But I am in the hands of the \r\nAssembly. If you are insisting, it means that the \r\nmeeting would have to be suspended. So can I appeal \r\nto my colleague from Cameroon? \r\n I give the floor to the representative of Guinea-\r\nBissau. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau): Please, could the \r\nSecretariat just tell us if it is possible or not to satisfy \r\nthe request made by the representative of Cameroon. \r\nWe are all very reasonable people here. We just want to \r\nknow if it is possible to satisfy his request. He has not \r\nrequested, if my understanding is correct — that is my \r\ninterpretation of his request — that the Legal Counsel \r\nhimself come here, but there is a Legal Office. There \r\nare very competent people there. Whenever there is a \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly, and indeed any \r\nofficial meeting of the United Nations, there should be \r\nat the disposal of that meeting a legal counsel to guide \r\nthe proceedings of the meeting. \r\n Now, is it possible to satisfy that request? As to \r\nthe lateness of the hour, people are paid to work until \r\n6 p.m. at least, and the meeting is still going on here. Is \r\nit possible or not? If not, we will accommodate that.  \r\n We have a different interpretation of rule 151 of \r\nthe rules of procedure of the General Assembly. While \r\nI have the floor, I shall read it out, just because we are \r\ndealing with clever people here.  \r\n  “Any meeting of the General Assembly held \r\nin pursuance of the Statute of the International \r\nCourt of Justice for the purpose of electing \r\nmembers of the Court shall continue until as \r\nmany candidates as are required for all the seats \r\nto be filled have obtained in one or more ballots \r\nan absolute majority of votes.”  \r\n Then we are told that this is the second meeting. \r\nWhat about “shall continue”? But please tell us if it \r\npossible to have somebody come or not, and then if it \r\nis not possible, that is fine with us. \r\n The Acting President: Are there any other \r\nrequests? If not, I give the floor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I have just been told \r\nthat the view of the Legal Counsel of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is reflected in document A/63/186, the \r\nmemorandum by the Secretary-General, which was \r\ncited by Member States. If I may say, not as \r\nrepresentative of Legal Affairs, when it says in rule \r\n151 that “Any meeting of the General Assembly held in \r\npursuance … for the purpose of electing … shall \r\ncontinue until as many candidates as are required for \r\nall the seats to be filled”, our understanding is not that \r\nit is necessarily the same meeting, because the same \r\none is the third on the elections of the Security \r\nCouncil. That means that we cannot break after one \r\nmeeting to have a meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nsomething else, and then come back, but that we will \r\ncontinue with meetings of the Assembly until the \r\nelections are over. Otherwise, how can we coordinate \r\nand be in accordance with Article 11?  \r\n At the same time, we have to work simultaneously \r\nto synchronize the number of our meetings with the \r\nSecurity Council. Imagine that we are working in the \r\nsame meeting and we do not send a communication to \r\nthe Security Council on what has happened here, and \r\nwe are going with the same candidate — I just cannot \r\nimagine the outcome of such a practice. We are \r\nfollowing exactly the same practice as in previous \r\nyears, and the memorandum of the Secretary-General \r\nrepeats exactly the same as in every year.  \r\n The difference, and some delegates raised the \r\nissue, is that we have had more ballots during the first \r\nmeeting. During the last elections, in 2005, at the first \r\nballot there were more candidates with an absolute \r\nmajority than required. That is why there was another \r\nballot within the same meeting. I hope that that \r\nclarifies the situation. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Cameroon. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I note that our friend Mr. Botnaru has tried to \r\nprovide an explanation, but as he is not the Legal \r\nCounsel — and, Sir, if you do not want to invite the \r\nA/63/PV.40  \r\n \r\n08-59117 8 \r\n \r\nLegal Counsel, you can continue — we are not \r\nsatisfied. He is not the Legal Counsel, and I asked for \r\nthe Legal Counsel to provide an explanation. He is \r\nsimply saying that it is already mentioned in the \r\nmemorandum of the Secretary-General, but if you \r\ninsist that we continue, that is fine, but I am not happy. \r\n The Acting President: I thank the representative \r\nof Cameroon for his understanding. I take it that we \r\ncan now proceed. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of Benin on a \r\npoint of order. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation has some concerns. We would like to know \r\nwhether the candidate of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo was actually authorized to withdraw his \r\ncandidature at this state of the proceedings. That is \r\nreally a point of order. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): Yes, as I explained \r\nearlier, it is the sovereign right of Member States to \r\nwithdraw their candidature, and, as I explained earlier, \r\nif the candidate has support from more than one \r\ngroup — from more than its own national group — all \r\nother groups should support that proposal. In this case, \r\nthe candidate is considered withdrawn, and we go \r\nahead. As the candidate has the support of his national \r\ngroup only, the rules are satisfied and we can go ahead \r\nwith elections. \r\n The Acting President: We shall now begin the \r\nvoting process. Ballot papers will now be distributed. \r\nAll the candidates whose names appear on the ballot \r\npaper are eligible. The name of the candidate who has \r\nwithdrawn has been deleted from the ballot. \r\n May I once again remind delegations that the \r\nname of only one candidate should be marked with a \r\ncross. Any ballot paper on which more than one name \r\nis marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast \r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot papers. \r\n  At the invitation of the President, Mrs. Noni Ismi \r\n(Brunei Darussalam), Ms. Yuliana Georgieva \r\n(Bulgaria), Miss Sheree Chambers (Jamaica), \r\nMr. Paul Ballantyne (New Zealand), Mr. Saidu \r\nDodo (Nigeria) and Ms. Louise Ahldén (Sweden) \r\nacted as tellers. \r\n \r\n  A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was suspended at 5.25 p.m. and resumed at \r\n6.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   189 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   189 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of members voting:  189 \r\nRequired absolute majority:  97 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia) 116 \r\n Ms. Miriam Defensor-Santiago \r\n (Philippines)    52 \r\n Mr. Maurice Kamto (Cameroon) 21 \r\n Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf of Somalia has \r\nobtained an absolute majority in the General Assembly. \r\nI have communicated the result of the vote to the \r\nPresident of Security Council. I have received the \r\nfollowing letter from His Excellency Mr. Jorge Urbina, \r\nPresident of the Security Council: \r\n  “I have the honour to inform you that at the \r\n6012th meeting of the Security Council, held on \r\n6 November 2008 for the purpose of electing five \r\nmembers of the International Court of Justice for \r\na term of office beginning on 6 February 2009, \r\nMr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes.” \r\n Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf has therefore \r\nobtained an absolute majority in both the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. He is therefore \r\nduly elected as a member of the International Court of \r\nJustice to serve for a nine-year term commencing on \r\n6 February 2009. I take this opportunity to extend to \r\nhim the congratulations of the Assembly on his election.  \r\n As a result of the independent voting in the \r\nSecurity Council and in the General Assembly, the \r\nfollowing five candidates have obtained an absolute \r\nmajority in both organs: Mr. Ronny Abraham, \r\nMr. Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, Mr. Antônio Augusto \r\nCançado Trindade, Mr. Christopher Greenwood and \r\nMr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf. I thank the tellers for \r\ntheir assistance. \r\n We have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (c) of agenda item 103. \r\n A/63/PV.40\r\n \r\n9 08-59117 \r\n \r\n I give the floor to the representative of \r\nCameroon. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): First of all, I would like to warmly \r\ncongratulate all the judges who have been elected. \r\nGiven the results of the election, I am sure they will \r\nfully and effectively fulfil their mandate at the Court. \r\n Secondly, I wanted to ensure that it is recorded in \r\nthe verbatim records that throughout the election there \r\nwere difficulties, that my delegation requested the \r\nLegal Counsel to come and give an accurate \r\ninterpretation of the rules and that the Legal Counsel \r\ndid not come. \r\n Thirdly, I would like to point out that, in the last \r\nround of elections, the list from which the General \r\nAssembly worked was not the same as in the Security \r\nCouncil, in that in the meantime one candidate had \r\nwithdrawn, which meant that it was different from the \r\nlist that the Security Council used for its own vote. \r\nAccording to the rules, we should have adjourned the \r\nmeeting to enable the Security Council to have the \r\nsame list for the election, and, as that was not the case, \r\nI must express great regret. I would like all those \r\npoints to appear in the verbatim record, so that in the \r\nfuture we avoid the difficulties that occurred during \r\nthis vote. \r\n Once again, my delegation would like to \r\ncongratulate the judges who have been elected and \r\nwish them much success in carrying out their function \r\nas judges of the Court. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
