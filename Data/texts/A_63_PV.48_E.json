(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 45 (continued) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/262) \r\n  \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/127) \r\n  \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/63/L.23 and \r\nA/63/L.24/Rev.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Hermann Gröhe, Minister \r\nof State and Special Envoy of the Chancellor of the \r\nFederal Republic of Germany. \r\n Mr. Gröhe (Germany): On behalf of the Federal \r\nGovernment of Germany, I wish to underline the great \r\nimportance we attach to fostering a culture of peace. \r\nWe therefore welcome the convening of this summit. I \r\nshould like to express my full support for the statement \r\nof the European Union delivered at the 47th meeting \r\nby Alain Juppé on behalf of the French presidency. \r\n Achieving and safeguarding peace and security, \r\nmaking a life in freedom and dignity possible for all \r\npeople — these goals constitute the core of the United \r\nNations mandate. They have not become any less \r\nsignificant in 2008. On the contrary; today they still \r\nrequire us to do everything in our power to reach them. \r\n The past years have shown again and again that \r\nnational and international conflicts demand more than \r\njust national, intergovernmental or international peace \r\nefforts, though those are and will remain necessary. In \r\norder to ensure lasting success, such political efforts at \r\nall levels require the support of a culture of peace \r\nwithin our societies, as well as among States. \r\nAchieving this culture of peace requires the efforts of \r\nthe forces that hold our societies together. That \r\nespecially includes religious beliefs and other \r\nworldviews. \r\n His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia was \r\ntherefore right to ask what contributions religions can \r\nmake to a culture of peace.  \r\n We can find impressive examples throughout \r\nhistory and up to our own time of people in all \r\nreligions who, through their belief in an almighty \r\ncreator, a just judge or a merciful father, were inspired \r\nto perform great acts of humanity and to show \r\ncompassion and love to their fellow human beings, \r\nespecially those in need. At the same time, in all \r\nreligions we find examples of how they are abused in \r\nclaims to political power and even of how they have \r\nclaimed absolute political power for themselves. \r\n Even when religious convictions are misused to \r\njustify hate and violence, general suspicion of a certain \r\nreligion, or of religious beliefs at all, is not \r\nappropriate. For example, if Islamist terrorists and \r\nextremists distort their religion, that in no way justifies \r\nany kind of Islamophobia.  \r\n What is needed in response to such misuses, \r\nhowever, is the willingness of religions to engage in \r\nself-critical reflection on such distortions. This \r\nwillingness must also assure that there is no room for \r\ncondescending arrogance towards those of other faiths. \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 2 \r\n \r\nIt can pave the way for mutual ethical conviction that \r\nlays the foundation for common service to peace, \r\njustice and the preservation of creation. \r\n Consider what people of different religious faiths \r\ncould contribute to a culture of peace if they were \r\naware, for example, that the golden rule of treating \r\nothers as you would like to be treated can be found in \r\nnearly identical language among the teachings of the \r\ngreat Greek philosophers as well as of the philosophers \r\nof the Age of Enlightenment, just as it can be found in \r\nConfucianism, Buddhism and Hinduism, in the \r\nTalmud, the Christian Gospels and in the Islamic \r\nhadith collection.  \r\n We have a common ground for assuming our \r\ncommon global responsibility. At the same time, \r\ndifferences do not have to be denied. The conviction \r\nthat we all share more or less the same beliefs is not \r\nnecessary for us to be able to respect each other or \r\nother cultures and religions. Our readiness to treat each \r\nother respectfully proves itself precisely in those \r\nmoments when we are aware of the differences in our \r\nconvictions and can clearly name them and yet still \r\nview each other as equals. \r\n “All human beings are born free and equal in \r\ndignity and rights.” Today we are still committed to \r\nthis principle, taken from Article 1 of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. In consequence, those \r\ncommitted to universal human dignity, those who want \r\nto engage religious communities and believers of \r\ndifferent faiths, as well as adherents to non-religious \r\nworldviews, for a culture of peace must embrace \r\nfreedom of thought, conscience and religion, as laid \r\nout in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration. \r\n Recognizing the significance of religious freedom \r\nin no way implies that other human rights are less \r\nimportant. When the State exerts strict control over \r\nreligious services, the prayers of the faithful, religious \r\neducation of children or charitable actions, that \r\nexpresses the totality of its claim to power even in the \r\nmost personal aspects of everybody’s life.  \r\n All people must enjoy freedom of religion. The \r\nprinciples of freedom and equality forbid people of a \r\ncertain faith or culture from arbitrarily limiting the \r\nfreedom of those who think differently.  \r\n It is also unacceptable to put the equal dignity \r\nand the equal rights of women in question on the \r\nground of religious or ideological doctrine.  \r\n Time and again, religious feelings have been \r\noffended worldwide. I myself, as a Christian, have \r\nshared the bitter experience of my religious feelings \r\nbeing offended. However, those violations never justify \r\nviolence. The rule of law and respect for others’ \r\nfreedom of thought must also prevail in such difficult \r\nsituations. We cannot accept religious intolerance \r\ntowards those who think differently. We commit \r\nourselves to constantly fight any form of anti-\r\nSemitism.  \r\n Freedom of religion necessarily includes freedom \r\nof choice. A person must be free to decide if she or he \r\nwants to profess a certain faith. This includes that \r\nevery person has the right to convert to another faith. \r\nThus it is unacceptable that laws in some countries \r\neven today threaten those who want to convert with \r\ndeath.  \r\n It is time to put an end to the harassment, terror \r\nand murder that force members of religious minorities \r\nto flee their homes and countries. Freedom of religion \r\nis about the individual’s freedom to practice her or his \r\nreligion or worldview, alone or with others, publicly or \r\nprivately. And it is necessarily about the right of \r\nreligious communities to organize themselves freely, to \r\nserve their members and to contribute to all aspects of \r\npublic life. In doing so, they will play an important \r\nrole for a culture of peace. \r\n The diversity of world cultures and religions is a \r\nfeature that has marked human development. \r\nConsidering worldwide migration and globalization, \r\nregions that are shaped by only one religion are the \r\nexception. Multiculturalism and mutlireligiosity are \r\noften a reality. \r\n Simultaneously, the understandable desire to \r\nconfirm or preserve one’s own identity exists. In this \r\nsituation, it is more vital than ever to provide young \r\npeople in particular with the basics of a culture of \r\npeace and the understanding that all people have the \r\nright to equality and freedom. There is a need to make \r\nyoung people, and ourselves, aware of the silent \r\nharbingers of discrimination and religious intolerance, \r\nof how prejudice is stirred up or of how entire groups — \r\nthose with a different skin colour or different beliefs — \r\nare stigmatized.  \r\n Respect for one another and interest in one \r\nanother must be the basis for an interreligious \r\ndialogue. Treating one another respectfully does not \r\nhave to exclude a search for truth. However, what must \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n3 08-60077 \r\n \r\nbe ruled out is forcing one\u0027s own beliefs on others \r\nthrough violence. In recent decades, there have been \r\nnumerous initiatives for intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue in our societies, between States and at the \r\nlevel of the United Nations. Politics can and should \r\nsupport such initiatives. \r\n At its core, however, this dialogue — and this \r\nalso includes our understanding of religious freedom — \r\nmust be developed within the religious communities \r\nthemselves. What we need is the commitment of \r\nreligious communities, not the creation of new \r\nstructures or institutions at the political level, whether \r\nas part of the United Nations or in other multilateral \r\nforums. \r\n For decades now, important things have been \r\nhappening in dialogues among religious communities. \r\nJews, Christians and Muslims have learned much from \r\nand about one another in these sometimes painful \r\ndebates. The increased participation of other religious \r\ntraditions — not least the great religious traditions of \r\nAsia — would certainly be welcome in these dialogues. \r\n When people can profess their faith without fear, \r\nespecially if they belong to a religious minority, when \r\nreligious communities have the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in shaping human interaction in freedom \r\nand when all people — regardless of their faith or \r\nworld view — enjoy mutual respect for their worth, we \r\nwill know that we are moving towards a culture of \r\npeace. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdulkarim Al-Eryani, former \r\nPrime Minister and Special Adviser to the President of \r\nthe Republic of Yemen. \r\n Mr. Al-Eryani (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): It is \r\ntruly historic and highly significant that this high-level \r\nmeeting is being held within the framework of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to strengthen the culture of peace \r\nand dialogue among representatives of cultures and \r\nreligions in all their diversity. Undoubtedly, the \r\nOrganization is the most appropriate forum in which to \r\npromote dialogue among religions and cultures. As \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said, the \r\nUnited Nations is truly an Organization that can \r\nharmonize cultures and religions and a forum in which \r\npeoples can meet and share the benefits of such \r\ndialogue with their cultures and societies, which \r\nenables them to truly flourish.  \r\n This meeting has been convened to reaffirm that a \r\ngathering of cultures and human beliefs reflects the \r\ndiversity of human civilization. That is why this \r\nmeeting is so important, because it is aimed at \r\npromoting a culture of dialogue among all \r\nrepresentatives of cultures and religions throughout the \r\nworld. This meeting also has a particularly historic \r\naspect, because it was conceived in the city of Mecca, \r\ntowards which the eyes of more than a billion Muslims \r\nturn every day. Here, I should like to refer to the \r\nhistoric initiative launched by King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. This meeting \r\nfollows the Madrid Conference that was held in July of \r\nthis year. Both initiatives were undertaken by the \r\nMuslim World League under the auspices and \r\nleadership of the Saudi King.  \r\n Indeed, the call of Mecca is an appeal for \r\ndialogue based on the Islamic faith, which encourages \r\nus to come to God on the basis of a constructive \r\ndialogue, because, as God told us, you have your faith \r\nand I have mine. This call from Mecca is a tradition \r\nfound in all religious beliefs and philosophical \r\ntraditions throughout the world: human societies are \r\ncalled upon to engage in dialogue, which, in fact, is a \r\nprerequisite for human progress.  \r\n The Madrid Declaration, adopted as the outcome \r\nof the meeting held by the Muslim World League under \r\nthe leadership of the Saudi King, reaffirmed that \r\nequality should prevail among all men and women in \r\nthe diversity of their cultures and faiths. That is one of \r\nthe lessons of the Koran and a prerequisite for human \r\nprogress. Respect for others, for the cultures of peoples \r\nand for their freedom to govern themselves is the basis \r\nof all human relations. It is a teaching found in all \r\nreligions and cultural traditions, and it enables us to \r\nexchange information and knowledge, which can lead \r\nto happiness throughout the world.  \r\n We Muslims, who base our world view on ijtihad, \r\nwhich is a truly exegetical effort to understand the \r\nworld and the other, believe that the Western world \r\nmust revise all of its concepts and notions about \r\nMuslims and the Muslim world. According to Roger \r\nJaroudi there must be a cross-fertilization among \r\ncivilizations and a genuine dialogue, in which all seek \r\nto understand the other without preconditions. \r\n Today, more than ever before, we sorely need a \r\nculture of peace based on dialogue that will overcome \r\nmisunderstanding. No one has a monopoly on truth; \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 4 \r\n \r\nindeed, to believe that is to turn one’s back on truth. \r\nThe tearing down of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist \r\nevents of 11 September 2001 spread fear in the Western \r\nworld about the emergence of a new enemy called \r\nIslam. That belief is born of mutual ignorance, which \r\nhas spread imaginary fears based on the false notion \r\nthat a clash of civilizations is unavoidable. To believe \r\nin a clash of civilizations is to forget that Islam was \r\ncross-pollinated with Greek culture and disseminated \r\nit, thus fostering well-being for humanity as a whole \r\nand helping to inspire the renaissance in Europe. That \r\nwas a historic era, which opened up new horizons for \r\nhumanity.  \r\n It is our duty and responsibility, both within the \r\nUnited Nations and through bilateral or multilateral \r\nchannels, to truly promote genuine dialogue among \r\ncultures and beliefs. We must promote such dialogue \r\nby every means at our disposal. Yemen and \r\nSwitzerland have made their contribution in this area \r\nby holding symposia at which illustrious academic \r\nfigures are invited to speak.  \r\n Finally, we would like to appeal for the adoption \r\nof measures to be followed up by an expert committee \r\ncomprising representatives of all religions, cultures and \r\ncivilizations. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Theodoros Kassimis, Deputy \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Greece. \r\n Mr. Kassimis (Greece): I am truly pleased to \r\ncommend, today, in this forum, Saudi Arabia’s current \r\ninitiative on interreligious dialogue, launched under the \r\nauspices of His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz \r\nAl Saud.  \r\n Greece aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby Mr. Alain Juppé, Special Envoy of the President of \r\nthe French Republic, on behalf of the European Union. \r\n For Greece, this is very much a vindication of our \r\nown policies in this field, as we were among the very \r\nfirst countries in the West to open concrete channels of \r\ncommunication and dialogue with the Muslim world, \r\neven before the Second World War. Such dialogue is \r\nmaintained at many levels. As a State, Greece \r\nmaintains numerous and well-established bilateral \r\ncontacts and is a party to many multilateral forums \r\nwithin the United Nations system, in the European \r\nUnion and in specific activities, such as the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. \r\n However, it is at the level of institutions of faith \r\nthat Greece and the Greek world enjoy a truly \r\nprivileged position, thanks to the crucial role played in \r\nboth ecumenical and interreligious dialogue by the \r\nancient churches of the Greek world. Indeed, although \r\nmost of them are incorporated under the laws of the \r\nlands in which they are established, they are very much \r\nat the root of modern Greek culture and civilization. \r\n Such a background was essential to the Greek \r\nworld’s establishment of a leading position in the \r\ndialogue with Islam and Judaism, thanks to a \r\ncontinuous interaction with both religions for almost \r\n2,000 years, the lack of colonial baggage in its history \r\nand a deep understanding of and respect for the \r\nmentality of the peoples of the area. \r\n At the same time, we are well aware of our \r\nposition in the Western world. Democracy is very \r\nmuch Greece’s own contribution to European and \r\nWestern civilization and the early Greek world was a \r\nmajor contributor to the fashioning of Roman law and \r\nChristian ethics. We thus cherish the community of our \r\nvalues, along with other societies that have been \r\nformed in the same ethical and philosophical matrix. \r\n We also know that we hold most of these values \r\nin common with our Muslim and Jewish partners and \r\nneighbours. In this context, the Saudi initiative on \r\ninterfaith dialogue is most welcome. We look forward \r\nto a close and fruitful collaboration in this context, one \r\nin which Greece and Europe will contribute what they \r\nhave achieved over the years, especially in defining \r\nhuman rights and in incorporating them into their legal \r\nsystems. Indeed, we consider freedom of religion and \r\nworship, together with freedom of thought and \r\nexpression, to be at the very foundations of our \r\nphilosophy on life and on the position of mankind in \r\nthe universe. \r\n Apart from dialogue, however, we need to \r\nembark on a large-scale campaign for religious \r\neducation. We need to inform our peoples about the \r\ntrue message of our respective religions. We live in a \r\nmaterialistic era, in which some are attempting to \r\nuproot the eternal and universal values of our societies. \r\nThis has provided an opportunity to certain forces to \r\nviolently alter the values of faith and to substitute them \r\nwith messages of hate and division. There is, however, \r\nno religion, no religious figure, nor any sacred script \r\nthat preaches hatred among people. On the contrary, \r\nthe divine commandment common to all our faiths is a \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n5 08-60077 \r\n \r\nmessage of love, solidarity, peaceful coexistence and \r\nrespect for all people on Earth. This has to be the \r\nmessage of our dialogue, and it is with this message \r\nthat our children should be brought up. \r\n Eighteen months ago, in an attempt to build \r\nbridges of peace and cooperation in our region, we \r\nlaunched an initiative called “Building the future”. We \r\norganized a summer camp in Greece for children aged \r\n12 to 14 from Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Israel and \r\nGreece. Twenty children from each of these countries \r\nparticipated. Boys and girls, Muslims, Jews and \r\nChristians, lived together for three weeks. We did not \r\nallow anyone to poison them with false messages. We \r\nleft them by themselves, armed with the religious \r\nbeliefs they had from their parents, their pure souls and \r\ntheir passion to enjoy life. These children developed a \r\ndialogue of their own through their games, the \r\ntraditional dances of their homelands, the artwork that \r\nthey crafted together and the happiness that showed on \r\ntheir faces. The outcome of their dialogue could be \r\nseen when the time came to bid farewell and is \r\nreflected in the letters sent by their parents. \r\n Our dialogue here is a more difficult one. We \r\nhave to fight the forces of hatred and division. I am \r\ncertain that if we all pull together and believe in this \r\ncommon cause, we will emerge as victors for world \r\npeace, solidarity and mutual understanding, so that we \r\nmay be able to prove what our respective faiths teach \r\nus: that we all are children of the same God.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Miguel Abdón Saguier, \r\nSenator and member of the Commission of External \r\nRelations and International Affairs of the Republic of \r\nParaguay.  \r\n Mr. Saguier (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nare pleased to be here as further testimony of the \r\nimportance that my country and its Government \r\nattribute to the culture of peace. \r\n Paraguay would like resolutely to uphold the \r\nnoble mission of the United Nations and its Members \r\nin achieving a broad and in-depth understanding among \r\nthe different cultures. That is why we enthusiastically \r\nsupport initiatives of dialogue among different peoples, \r\nGovernments and religions. \r\n Humankind, unique in its origin and diverse in its \r\ncultural manifestation, has, by means of dialogue, its \r\nonly way to try to overcome the injustice and violence \r\nthat demean it. Dialogue has as a starting point \r\nacceptance of the other, even if that “other” is different \r\nthan myself, not only that the “other” may live but live \r\ntogether, not only that the “other” may exist but \r\ncoexist. Unlike dialogue, in violence there is no \r\nacceptance, but only the attempt to eliminate the other. \r\n Dialogue can take place only if we accept, or \r\neven better tolerate, the cultural and religious \r\ncharacteristics that distinguish each people, each \r\nnational society, that form an integral part of \r\nhumankind. \r\n To avoid misunderstandings that can lead to \r\ntragic consequences, it is essential to understand that \r\nsuicidal indifference towards bloody and premeditated \r\nincidents — which in most cases mean that the \r\ninnocent pay for the sinners — is not tolerance. The \r\nprotagonists, the fanatics, want to show by means of \r\nviolence the supposed strength of their demands, when \r\nin fact what they are doing is obscuring the \r\njustification of their grievances. \r\n Justifiably, the Spanish philosopher Fernando \r\nSavater says that fanaticism is in no way strength of \r\nconviction, but, quite the contrary, panic in the face of \r\npossible contamination by what is different. The \r\nfanatic cannot bear to live among those who think \r\ndifferently for fear of discovering that he is not so sure \r\nof what he says he believes. Thus, Nietzsche \r\ndetermined that fanaticism was the only strength of \r\nwill of which the weak are capable.  \r\n A number of leaders pointed out here yesterday \r\nthat religion was not the cause of violence, specifically \r\nterrorism, but rather the pretext of those who corrupt \r\nthe faith of their peoples for political ends. In that way, \r\nthey claim that it is only the end, not the means that \r\nmatters, trying to obscure the fact that the means \r\ndetermine the end. History teaches us that those who \r\ngain power through violence will always have to resort \r\nto violence to maintain that power. That is not the path \r\ntowards humanist ethics or religious piety, whatever \r\nthe religion, be it called Christianity, Judaism, Islam or \r\nany other. \r\n When we speak of tolerance, we cannot forget the \r\nCatholic belief set out in the resolutions of the Second \r\nEcumenical Council of the Vatican and in the \r\nencyclicals of John Paul XXIII and Paul VI, which \r\npresent us with the profound and thought-provoking \r\nideas that even those who are mistaken still retain their \r\nhuman dignity.  \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 6 \r\n \r\n Paraguay and its Government, deeply imbued \r\nwith humanist ideas, pledge their support for the \r\ninitiative before us today (A/63/L.24/Rev.1), in the \r\nhope that this important high-level meeting will \r\nachieve practical results for all nations of the world in \r\nthe search for cooperation, understanding, justice and \r\npeace which are so essential for the moral and material \r\nprogress of all our nations. \r\n We cannot conclude this statement without \r\nexpressing our gratitude to His Majesty, the Custodian \r\nof the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud; the President of the General \r\nAssembly; Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann; and \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for this important \r\ninitiative that has brought us together today. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Masahiko Koumura, \r\nSpecial Envoy of the Prime Minister of Japan. \r\n Mr. Koumura (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I am \r\nhonoured, Sir, to have the opportunity to address you \r\ntoday as the Special Envoy of the Prime Minister of \r\nJapan, Mr. Taro Aso, and on behalf of the Government \r\nof Japan. \r\n We are gathered here today at this high-level \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on dialogue among \r\nreligions and civilizations in response to the strong \r\ninitiative taken by the Custodian of the Two Holy \r\nMosques, King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud of \r\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Japan welcomes the \r\nconvening of this meeting, just as it welcomed and \r\nattached great importance to the Muslim dialogue, held \r\nin Mecca in June, and the World Conference on \r\nDialogue, held in Madrid in July. \r\n In January 1999, as Foreign Minister of Japan, I \r\nmade a speech in Ramallah entitled: \"Building a New \r\nBridge between Japan and the Middle East toward the \r\nTwenty-First Century\". I urged then that we profit from \r\nthe lessons we learned during the century that was just \r\ncoming to a close, filled as it had been with war and \r\nconflict, and make the twenty-first century a time of \r\npeace and prosperity. Instead, in the decade that has \r\npassed since I was in Ramallah, what we have seen in \r\nthe Middle East and too many other regions around the \r\nworld is more conflict and incidents that have only \r\nserved to heighten tensions. \r\n Such disorder, strife and conflict have many \r\ncauses. Tremendous efforts have been made to address \r\nthem in the United Nations and other forums. Yet, if we \r\nare ever to succeed in devising better, more durable \r\nsolutions, it will be because the parties concerned and \r\nthe international community have the political will to \r\ndo so. It will be because we choose to engage in \r\ndialogue over violence. Certainly, it is impossible to \r\nresolve a conflict unless each party first recognizes the \r\nother’s existence and demonstrates respect for their \r\nethnicity, culture and religion. \r\n We need also to take into account the impact that \r\nglobalization has had on the world. Through the rapid \r\nexpansion of trade and the development of information \r\nand communication technologies, the daily lives of \r\nmany people have been made easier. At the same time, \r\nglobalization has removed many of the barriers that \r\nearlier separated groups with different identities and \r\ndifferent ways of life. As they now confront one \r\nanother, conventional authority and order are being \r\nshaken. New tensions are piled on old, a situation that \r\ncan be expected to continue until a new, more stable \r\norder is established. \r\n We have an obligation now to pool our wisdom \r\nso as to maximize the benefits of globalization and \r\nminimize the harm it can do. People who face a crisis \r\nof identity are vulnerable. When a small band of \r\nextremists succeeds in inciting even the slightest \r\nfriction among ethnic or religious groups, the fires of \r\ndistrust and hatred are stoked, and yesterday’s peaceful \r\nneighbours suddenly become wary of one another, or \r\nworse. We should not regard differences in culture or \r\nideology as handicaps. Far from it; they are assets that \r\ncan infuse a society with creativity, causing it to flower \r\nand endow its members with greater tolerance, and \r\neven appreciation, of what each has to offer. For this to \r\nhappen, however, greater political leadership is \r\nrequired. \r\n Equally pressing in confronting the global issues \r\nof our time, the nations and regions of the world must \r\nwork in concert, in a firm and courageous manner, to \r\nsecure the common interests of humankind, which \r\nextend far beyond petty differences. This is clearly \r\nhow we must confront the current financial crisis, \r\nwhich is unprecedented in scale. In contrast to the dark \r\nera nearly 80 years ago, when the Great Depression \r\nplunged the nations of the world into the Second World \r\nWar, today we know that we need to coordinate the \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n7 08-60077 \r\n \r\npolicies we adopt if we are to surmount this challenge \r\nand end the vicious spiral of financial turmoil. \r\n On the issue of climate change, the leaders of the \r\nG-8 said at the Hokkaido Toyako Summit earlier this \r\nyear that they shared the long-term objective of cutting \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent by the \r\nyear 2050. They understood that failure to do so would \r\nlead to even more global warming and deal a massive \r\nblow to humankind and the environment of the planet \r\nthat is our home. \r\n The same can be said about the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We know that the first victims of \r\nnatural disasters and conflicts, no matter where in the \r\nworld they occur, are always the poor. Leaving behind \r\nthose who are weak and vulnerable makes a society \r\nunstable and impedes the progress of the reforms for \r\nwhich we have promised to work. \r\n With this in mind, Japan has been striving to \r\nmake the most effective use of official development \r\nassistance and other tools to assist the nations and \r\nregions of the world to promote stability and prosperity \r\nthrough efforts such as those being made to create a \r\n“corridor of peace and prosperity”. Japan has also been \r\nextending cooperation in such areas as education, the \r\ndevelopment of human resources and helping women \r\nto live independent lives. \r\n We know that in the course of human history \r\nthere have been long periods during which peoples \r\nwhose identities reside in their different cultures, \r\nreligions and ethnicities have coexisted peacefully. \r\nTolerance, religious symbiosis and coexistence have \r\nbeen the norm among followers of Islam and in the \r\nsocieties of the Middle East in general. In Asia, \r\nwhether in India, China or elsewhere, different \r\nreligions have managed for much of history to exist in \r\nproximity to one another without the eruption of \r\nconflict. For its part, Japan has benefited since ancient \r\ntimes from the products of the civilizations of China \r\nand India. Japan has also absorbed the fruits of Western \r\nculture, including universal values such as freedom and \r\ndemocracy.  \r\n Precisely because Japan’s unique culture assumed \r\nits present form in this manner, it knows the value of \r\ndynamic exchange and interaction with other cultures. \r\nJapan, therefore, intends to contribute actively to \r\ndialogue and the promotion of harmony among the \r\nreligions and civilizations of the world. It is already \r\ncooperating with Islamic countries in conducting the \r\ndialogue among civilizations between Japan and the \r\nIslamic world and we shall continue to engage in \r\nexchanges of this kind. \r\n In closing, let me once again express my deep \r\nappreciation to King Abdullah for the initiative he has \r\ntaken and salute the conviction and courage shown by \r\nall those who have supported it. I hope that at this \r\nmeeting we shall reaffirm our determination and \r\ncommitment to take strong, joint action and ensure \r\nsolidarity and peaceful coexistence among the peoples \r\nof the world. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. George W. Bush, President of the \r\nUnited States of America \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the United \r\nStates of America. \r\n Mr. George W. Bush, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. George W. \r\nBush, President of the United States of America, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Bush: Laura and I are pleased to be \r\nback here at the United Nations, and I am grateful for \r\nthe opportunity to once again address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n I want to thank King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia \r\nfor his leadership and for convincing us all to come \r\ntogether to speak about faith. I appreciate the \r\nparticipants who recognize the transformative and \r\nuplifting power of faith.  \r\n One of my core beliefs is that there is an \r\nAlmighty God, and that every man, woman and child \r\non the face of this Earth bears His image. Many years \r\nago, faith changed my life. Faith has sustained me \r\nthrough the challenges and the joys of my Presidency. \r\nAnd faith will guide me for the rest of my days. \r\n I know many of the leaders gathered in this \r\nAssembly have been influenced by faith, as well. We \r\nmay profess different creeds and worship in different \r\nplaces, but our faith leads us to common values. We \r\nbelieve God calls us to love our neighbors, and to treat \r\none another with compassion and respect. We believe \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 8 \r\n \r\nGod calls us to honour the dignity of all life, and to \r\nspeak against cruelty and injustice. We believe God \r\ncalls us to live in peace, and to oppose all those who \r\nuse His name to justify violence and murder. Freedom \r\nis God’s gift to every man, woman, and child, and that \r\nfreedom includes the right of all people to worship as \r\nthey see fit. \r\n Sixty years ago, members of the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly acknowledged this truth when we \r\nadopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\nThe Declaration proclaims that everyone has the right \r\nto choose or change religions, and the right to worship \r\nin private or in public. \r\n The United States strongly supported the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration. In fact, the \r\nAmerican delegation was led by a former First Lady, \r\nEleanor Roosevelt. When we voted for the Universal \r\nDeclaration, the American people reaffirmed a \r\nconviction that dates back to our earliest days. Our \r\nnation was founded by people seeking haven from \r\nreligious persecution. The First Amendment of our \r\nConstitution guarantees the free exercise of religion for \r\nall. And through the generations, our nation has helped \r\ndefend the religious liberty of others — from liberating \r\nthe concentration camps of Europe to protecting \r\nMuslims in places such as Kosovo, Afghanistan and \r\nIraq.  \r\n Today, the United States is carrying on that noble \r\ntradition by making religious liberty a central element \r\nof our foreign policy. We have established a \r\nCommission on International Religious Freedom to \r\nmonitor the state of religious liberty worldwide. We \r\nstrongly encourage nations to understand that religious \r\nfreedom is the foundation of a healthy and hopeful \r\nsociety. We are not afraid to stand with religious \r\ndissidents and believers who practise their faith, even \r\nwhere it is unwelcome.  \r\n One of the best ways to safeguard religious \r\nfreedom is to aid the rise of democracy. Democratic \r\nGovernments do not all look alike. Each reflects the \r\nhistory and traditions of its own people, but one of the \r\ndefining features of any democracy is that it makes \r\nroom for people of all backgrounds and all faiths. \r\nDemocracies allow people with diverse views to \r\ndiscuss their differences and live in harmony.  \r\n The expansion of democracy also represents the \r\nmost promising path to peace. People who are free to \r\nexpress their opinions can challenge the ideologies of \r\nhate. They can defend their religious beliefs and speak \r\nout against those seeking to twist them to evil ends. \r\nThey can prevent their children from falling under the \r\nsway of extremists by giving them a more hopeful \r\nalternative.  \r\n Over the past eight years, I have been privileged \r\nto see how freedom and faith can lift up lives and lead \r\nthe world towards peace. I remember clearly a \r\ncongregation in the State of Kansas in my country \r\nwhose members stayed together and prayed together, \r\neven when a tornado had torn down their church. I \r\nhave seen faithful caregivers on the continent of Africa \r\nwho take AIDS patients given up for dead and restore \r\nthem to health. I have seen mothers across the Middle \r\nEast whose faith leads them to dream of a better and \r\nmore peaceful future for their children — a dream \r\nshared by mothers all around the world.  \r\n I appreciate every nation participating in today’s \r\ndialogue. Through dialogue, we can draw closer to the \r\nday when our prayers for freedom and peace are \r\nanswered and every person on Earth enjoys the rights \r\nand dignity granted by an Almighty God.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe United States of America for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. George W. Bush, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan. \r\n Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Asif Ali \r\nZardari, President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Zardari: We stand at a critical \r\ncrossroads as we gather in this great Hall of the \r\nnations. We hope that we have the opportunity to start \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n9 08-60077 \r\n \r\nafresh and rebuild a better world for our children to \r\nprosper. \r\n Yet, we still confront a dangerous world of \r\nconfrontation and terror, threatening to provoke the \r\nclash of civilizations that this dialogue was instituted \r\nto prevent. There remain those in this world who thrive \r\nin chaos, drawing power by pitting thought against \r\nthought, faith against faith and people against people. \r\nThat was surely not the world that man was gifted by \r\nour God. For the children of Ibrahim, the world was \r\nmeant to be a meeting ground of civilizations, ideas \r\nand human dignity. \r\n As the elected representative of 180 million \r\nPakistanis suffering from that menace of hatred, I \r\nreject those who would divide us and rally around \r\nthose who would unite us as creations of the one and \r\nonly God. I take that inspiration from my elder brother, \r\na man of wisdom and action, the Custodian of the Two \r\nHoly Mosques, His Majesty King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud. I commend and congratulate him \r\non having the courage and vision to convene this \r\nmeeting on interfaith dialogue. Many men talk change. \r\nHe brings it about.  \r\n In taking that initiative, His Majesty has, in fact, \r\nrevived the great Islamic tradition of reconciliation and \r\ninclusion. I find that this worthy act stems from His \r\nMajesty’s wisdom, which is leading his great country \r\ntoday on the path of progress, while following the \r\nfundamentals of our religion.  \r\n On the one hand, wisdom has guided the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia to build its first modern \r\nuniversity for women, designed to be the world’s \r\nlargest female centre of higher education. That may \r\nsurely be considered a historic milestone for the \r\nempowerment of women in the Kingdom and the \r\nMuslim world. On the other, His Majesty is the first \r\nSaudi leader to have travelled to the Vatican, opening \r\ndialogue between the two largest religions of our time. \r\nHis Majesty effectively laid the foundations for \r\nbringing the followers of different religions and beliefs \r\ncloser to one another at the Madrid Conference. \r\n As His Majesty’s tireless efforts yield results and \r\na galaxy of world leaders gather here today because of \r\nHis Majesty’s initiative, it is important for me to \r\nrecognize and acknowledge his noble contribution to \r\nthe cause of human unity and dignity. I wish to thank \r\nthe Assembly and His Majesty for all he has done for \r\nus.  \r\n For me and for the nation of Pakistan, our \r\nparticipation today at this event represents more than \r\njust an honour. For us, it is a personal opportunity to \r\nadvance the message of a moderate, modern and loving \r\nIslam, which guided the work of our beloved leader, \r\nShaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, who sacrificed her \r\nlife for the cause of tolerance and dialogue and the \r\navoidance of a clash of civilizations. That message is a \r\ncentral element of the Madrid Declaration, and thus it \r\nis especially fitting that we join together with Members \r\ntoday to continue the work for which she gave her life.  \r\n Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n I come here as the representative of the 180 \r\nmillion people of a country that was created with deep \r\nties to Islam, but from the very first days, in the vision \r\nof our founder the Quaid-i-Azam, was dedicated to the \r\ntolerance of the Holy Koran. Islam is tolerant of other \r\nreligions and cultures and of dissent. Allah tells us over \r\nand over again, through the Holy Koran, that he \r\ncreated people of different views and perspectives to \r\nsee the world in different ways and that diversity is \r\ngood, natural and part of God’s plan. The Koran’s \r\nmessage is open to the full participation of all people \r\nin the life of their societies and it encourages \r\nknowledge and scientific experimentation. \r\n Islam is grounded in the past and reaches out to \r\nthe future and one of its central guiding principles is \r\nthe reason we engage here today. Islam accepts as a \r\nfundamental principle the fact that humans were \r\ncreated within different societies and religions and they \r\nwill remain different. In the words of the Holy Book, \r\n“If your Lord had pleased He would certainly have \r\nmade people a single nation, and they shall continue to \r\ndiffer” (The Holy Koran, XI:118). \r\n Our world is home to people of many religions \r\nand creeds and they are all worthy of respect. All of \r\nGod’s creations deserve a better life in which the basic \r\nrights to food, education, shelter and the protection of \r\ntheir families is guaranteed. Above all, it is the basic \r\ndignity as human beings that must be universally \r\nrecognized and respected. \r\n In his last sermon on the occasion of his last hajj, \r\nthe Holy Prophet of Islam — may peace be upon him — \r\nsaid: “You are all children of Adam, and Adam was \r\ncreated from clay. You are all equal”. Throughout \r\nrecorded history, the enemies of peace have often \r\ninvoked faith as an instrument of creating disunity. \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 10 \r\n \r\nKing Abdullah, in his wisdom, has condemned those \r\nwho would use religion to advance a rigid and \r\nextremist political agenda. He has said that religion \r\nmust be a bridge bringing nations together, not a wall \r\nkeeping nations apart. It is therefore critical that we \r\nundertake the task of building upon faith as a means of \r\nfinding common ground between different nations and \r\ncivilizations.  \r\n It was that principle that prompted Pakistan and \r\nthe Philippines to be the original sponsors of resolution \r\n62/90, entitled “Promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace”. So as we gather here to move forward \r\ntowards those goals, let us not talk of what divides us, \r\nbut rather of what unites us as the creation of the same \r\ngod. \r\n I come from a country where the struggle for \r\nIslamic principles of gender equality, tolerance and \r\nreconciliation has brought us to the centre of the \r\ninternational stage. It is a measure of that struggle that \r\nthe first woman ever elected Prime Minister of a \r\nMuslim country was from Pakistan. It is a measure of \r\nthat struggle that twice my late wife and leader \r\nShaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto led the country as \r\nPrime Minister. Following in her footsteps, we made a \r\nwoman Speaker of the Parliament, again for the first \r\ntime anywhere in the Muslim world. And in coming \r\ngenerations, we hope to have a woman as president and \r\nhead of State.  \r\n In following the true spirit of Islam, the great \r\nleader of my country Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir \r\nBhutto fought and laid down her life advocating \r\ndialogue and tolerance and opposing extremism. \r\nIndeed, the last act of our great leader was to write a \r\nbook entitled Reconciliation, which that was published \r\nafter her assassination. In it, she rejected the so-called \r\nclash of civilizations as an attempt to twist the values \r\nof a great and noble religion. In her last words, she lays \r\nout a political vision of reconciliation that must guide \r\nus in the days and years ahead. Those views are the \r\nguiding principles of the newly elected democratic \r\nGovernment of Pakistan. Her example continues to \r\nlead us today, not only in Pakistan, but in every corner \r\nof the world.  \r\n In her honour, let us unite to create a world of \r\ntolerance and an end to bigotry. Let us unite to create a \r\nworld of understanding and respect. Let us unite to \r\nbuild a world of peace and stability. Let us unite to \r\ncreate the world of reconciliation for which she died.  \r\n To me, there is nothing more un-Islamic than \r\ndiscrimination. There is nothing more un-Islamic than \r\nviolence against women. Above all, there is nothing \r\nmore un-Islamic than terrorism — the killing of \r\ninnocent men, women and children — a crime \r\nexpressly prohibited in the text of all holy books. \r\n Unfortunately, at a time when most Muslims are \r\nadvocating interfaith dialogue, we are also witnessing \r\nevents that frustrate our call for dialogue. We hear hate \r\nspeeches across countries and regions in which Islam \r\nas a religion is attacked. Hate speech against Islam also \r\nleads to injustices against Muslims. Indeed, the \r\ndelusional fear of Islam has been rising. This is exactly \r\nwhat the terrorists had hoped to provoke. Those in the \r\nWest who accept that are falling into the trap of the \r\nterrorists. The delusional fear of our religion has \r\ncreated a new form of discrimination and is giving rise \r\nto new tensions. \r\n Let us translate the dynamic messages of our \r\nrespective religions for the good of humanity and not \r\nto create strife. Let us turn the message of hope \r\nembodied in our faiths into living and practical reality. \r\nTo that end, I propose consensus on an international \r\nagenda wherein hate speech aimed at inciting people \r\nagainst any religion is unacceptable and injustice and \r\ndiscrimination on the mere basis of one’s faith are \r\ndiscouraged; not only in words but through meaningful \r\nactions. Bigotry manifested in Islamophobia and anti-\r\nSemitism must be combated. Dialogue and not discord \r\nbetween civilizations and faiths must be encouraged. \r\nNations with little resources that are caught in the \r\ncrossfire of extremism should be strengthened and \r\naided by the international community. \r\n Let us not isolate people; let us engage people. \r\nViolence is an act of desperation. Let us commit \r\nourselves to eliminating the root causes of extremism \r\nand terrorism, giving all people in all societies renewed \r\nfaith in their countries, in their laws and in the futures \r\nof their children. Let us hit the causes of the terrorist \r\nmenace, not condemn its innocent victims. To us, Islam \r\nis about social justice and the emancipation of men and \r\nwomen. As such, we reach out to all of God’s \r\ncreations.  \r\n Islam is about serving the Muslim masses by \r\nending poverty and backwardness and building peace \r\nand tolerance. As such, we reach out to all of God’s \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n11 08-60077 \r\n \r\ncreations. Islam is opening the doors of knowledge for \r\neach and every citizen. As such, we reach out to all of \r\nGod’s creations. \r\n We must also commit resources to dialogue and \r\ninternational cultural understanding. In Pakistan, we \r\nhave already created the Benazir Democracy Institute. \r\nWe have created the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto \r\nFoundation to expressly promote and encourage \r\ndialogue, inclusion and exchange. We should be \r\nencouraging the successor generation — those who \r\nwill lead after us — to use education and exchange not \r\nonly to adapt to modernity, but to use modernity and \r\ntechnology to change the world. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Educating the nation’s young people and \r\ninternational exchanges of students, scholars and \r\nintellectuals are part of our dream of reconciliation. On \r\noccasion of this meeting, we dedicate ourselves to this \r\ndream. We do so for the children of our children; we do \r\nso for a better tomorrow; and we do so to leave behind \r\na world better than the one we found. This meeting on \r\ninterfaith dialogue must be the beginning of a new \r\njourney for our nations, in the immortal word of my \r\nbeloved wife, a journey of reconciliation. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Turkey \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear as address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey. \r\n Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Recep \r\nTayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nTurkey, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Erdoğan (Turkey) (spoke in Turkish; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I extend my heartfelt \r\ngreetings to all. We are gathered here today to consider \r\none of the most sensitive issues facing our world. I am \r\ngreatly honoured to be able to address the Assembly \r\nfrom this rostrum on the interfaith dialogue initiated by \r\nmy brother, His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia. It is \r\na matter of pride and joy for me to be here today. \r\n The participation of so many heads of State and \r\nGovernment in this high-level meeting has justified the \r\npersonal interest that His Majesty the King has taken in \r\nthe issue of interfaith dialogue. Naturally, we are all \r\naware of the underlying cause that has brought together \r\nsuch a distinguished gathering. \r\n This cause, or phenomenon, if you will, is the \r\nalarming level of polarization, lack of understanding \r\nand discrimination prevalent in the international \r\ncommunity. The precise nature of the steps to be taken \r\nin order to ensure respect for diversity, and their level \r\nof success, will have a profound effect on the character \r\nof international relations in the decades to come. \r\n It is evident that the behavioural norms of 20th \r\ncentury are now out of date and that, in these modern \r\ntimes, our world faces numerous new risks and threats. \r\nTerrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, illicit trafficking and organized crime have \r\nassumed global dimensions. While enormous advances \r\nhave been achieved in production and prosperity, we \r\ncannot claim that this prosperity has been shared \r\nequitably or that our world has become a safer place in \r\nwhich to live. In light of the tragic experiences we \r\nhave all had to endure, I would maintain that either we \r\nare all secure, or none of us is secure. \r\n This is especially true in the case of terrorism. I \r\ntake this opportunity to emphasize the following point \r\nin particular. We should now put an end to perceptions \r\nof “good” terrorists and “bad” terrorists, and avoid \r\nproviding refuge to terrorists of “others”. Terrorism is \r\ncrime against humanity, regardless of its source, \r\npretext or ambition. We believe that if a person slays a \r\nman, it will be as if he had slain the whole of mankind, \r\nand that if a person saves a man from death, it will be \r\nas if he had saved the whole of mankind. \r\n The risks and threats I mentioned earlier require, \r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity today more \r\nthan ever. Unfortunately, we have not achieved much \r\nsuccess in displaying common political will against \r\nthese challenges. We have so far failed to overcome the \r\npolarization, lack of understanding and discrimination \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 12 \r\n \r\nprevalent in the international community. We need to \r\nachieve greater progress in that direction. \r\n We should all note with satisfaction the steady \r\nincrease in the number of individuals who perceive the \r\nneed for respect for diversity and therefore wish to \r\nlaunch new initiatives or to contribute to existing \r\nefforts and endeavours. We thus welcome the initiative \r\nthat my dear friend and brother, His Majesty the King \r\nof Saudi Arabia, has launched in the field of \r\ntheological dialogue. I wish to thank him again for his \r\nefforts. \r\n Our theologians participated in the meeting of \r\nMuslim scholars held in Mecca in June 2008 and the \r\nsubsequent World Conference on Dialogue co-hosted \r\nwith Spain in Madrid in July 2008. This initiative will \r\nno doubt make a major contribution to the ongoing \r\nefforts for dialogue between faiths and cultures. \r\n I believe that the exchange of views taking place \r\nas part of this high-level meeting yesterday and today \r\nshould be considered as an indication of the heightened \r\nsensitivity of the international community. Other \r\ninitiatives in this field also represent individual \r\nexamples of the growing acknowledgement of this \r\nmessage and the greater acceptance of the fact that \r\npolarization and confrontation are detrimental. I note in \r\nparticular the promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace pursued by Pakistan and the Philippines, as \r\nwell as the forum organized by Kazakhstan on the \r\ntheme “Common world: progress through diversity”. \r\n Owing to its special geographic location, rich \r\nhistory and cultural heritage, Turkey feels an additional \r\nsense of responsibility in this process. The former \r\nPresident of Portugal, Mr. Jorge Sampaio, has been \r\nappointed High Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the Alliance of Civilizations, while the \r\nGroup of Friends set up at the United Nations has \r\ncontinued to grow. \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations today includes  \r\n78 countries and 13 international organizations. These \r\nachievements are an indication of the growing support \r\nof the international community for the principles and \r\naims of the Alliance. The Alliance has proved that the \r\nfundamental values that bring us together, such as \r\ndemocracy, human rights and rule of law, are stronger \r\nthan our cultural differences. \r\n We need the contribution of all the existing \r\ninitiatives in this field in order to limit the potential \r\ndanger posed by extremists. We should work together \r\nto ensure the success of these initiatives. I regard these \r\nefforts as mutually reinforcing and complementary, \r\nrather than competing, endeavours.  \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations will seek to enhance \r\nits contribution under the umbrella of the United \r\nNations and work to ensure that official policies and \r\nstatements reflect a moderate and responsible \r\napproach.  \r\n Through their national strategies, members of the \r\nGroup of Friends will endeavour to inform their own \r\npublic opinion on the aims of the Alliance and to \r\nremedy the current shortfalls in dialogue by developing \r\nprojects, especially in the fields of youth, media, \r\neducation and migration. \r\n In this vein, one of the most pressing issues \r\nconcerns the compatibility of freedom of expression \r\nand respect for religious beliefs. Freedom of \r\nexpression is one of the indispensable elements of our \r\ncivilization and the foundation upon which the other \r\nfreedoms rest, together with freedom of faith. What I \r\nhave in mind here is not the right to criticize or to \r\nquestion — the right to question is sacred in free \r\nsocieties. However, we regret to see that there is \r\nsometimes a very thin line between freedom of \r\nexpression and provocative attitudes calling for \r\ndiscrimination and even glorifying violence. Such \r\nrecent developments as the cartoon crisis, for instance, \r\nare sometimes too provocative to be explained within \r\nthe context of freedom of expression. \r\n We are under an absolute obligation to reflect \r\nupon the impact of such expressions within different \r\ncultures, religions and regions. Only then can we \r\nachieve a better understanding of one another. By \r\nrespecting each other’s sensitivities we therefore avoid \r\nmaking the mistake of branding as “the other” those \r\nwho are merely different.  \r\n I should also point out that, for global peace, we \r\nalso need to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict and to \r\nstabilize Iraq in a sustainable framework. We need to \r\nlive together. We need to respect one another. That is \r\nwhat I believe. Conflict is easy, whereas reconciliation \r\nis difficult. I firmly believe that, through our genuine \r\nand determined efforts, we will choose and succeed in \r\nthe difficult option. \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n13 08-60077 \r\n \r\n I wish to conclude my statement by inviting \r\nparticipants here today to the summit that will be \r\norganized in Istanbul in 2009. Participants may be \r\naware that the second forum of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations will be held on 2 and 3 April 2009 in the \r\ncity of Istanbul, which embraces two continents and \r\nthree monotheistic faiths. I will be honoured to host \r\nparticipants in Istanbul and to provide the opportunity \r\nto continue our deliberations at a location that \r\noverlooks the Bosphorus. I would like once more to \r\nthank my dear brother, the King of Saudi Arabia, for \r\ninitiating this gathering. I would also like to wish the \r\nAssembly the greatest success and extend it my deepest \r\nrespect and salutations.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Turkey for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Francisco Javier Rojo, President of the Senate of \r\nthe Kingdom of Spain. \r\n Mr. Rojo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMr. President, it is a great honour for me to accept your \r\ninvitation to participate in this General Assembly \r\ndebate on the agenda item “Culture of peace”, which \r\nprovides us with an excellent opportunity to exchange \r\nviews regarding the fundamental issues for coexistence \r\nand understanding among our societies. \r\n I would also like to express our profound \r\ngratitude to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, whose \r\nimpetus given to this plenary meeting has brought \r\ntogether numerous heads of State and Government as \r\nwell as other eminent personalities. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered yesterday by France on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. I would now like to take this \r\nopportunity to share with the Assembly some of the \r\nrecent experiences and views of Spain in relation to \r\nthis topic that has brought us together here. \r\n The Spanish Government attaches great \r\nimportance to all the initiatives undertaken to promote \r\ndialogue and understanding among the world’s peoples, \r\ncultures and religions. We share the concern about the \r\ngrowth of intolerance in all its aspects, and in that \r\nregard, we support Saudi Arabia’s endeavour for \r\nprogress to be made through dialogue, in mutual \r\nunderstanding among peoples, contributing to the \r\nelimination of extremism and radical and violent \r\nattitudes that can emerge within any community. \r\n The initiative of the Philippines and Pakistan fits \r\ninto this framework in favour of promoting \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace. \r\n Spain was pleased to receive the request by King \r\nAbdullah of Saudi Arabia for Madrid to host the World \r\nConference on Dialogue last July. We were honoured \r\nby this choice because, as His Majesty King Juan \r\nCarlos I stated, Spain constructed its democracy based \r\non tolerance, mutual respect and coexistence. At the \r\nMadrid Conference, a great number of representatives \r\nbelonging to different religions met, recalled the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations, and praised dialogue \r\nas an ideal means to reach a better understanding in \r\nhuman relationships as well as peaceful coexistence \r\namong nations. It is our fervent hope that this noble \r\neffort in interreligious dialogue will be fruitful and \r\nfoster the desired continuity. \r\n Spain is a non-confessional State in which, on the \r\nbasis of freedom of all religions and beliefs, there is \r\nseparation of Church and State. This does not prevent \r\nthe development of dialogue and collaboration between \r\nthe Government and the different creeds, because it is \r\nbased on mutual respect. Furthermore, and to a great \r\nextent due to the phenomenon of immigration, Spanish \r\nsociety is undergoing a growing diversification, which \r\nis reflected in a renewed interest by my country in all \r\nthose initiatives aimed at resolving the challenges \r\nraised by diversity, both inside and outside our borders. \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations, created in 2005 \r\nwithin the United Nations following the initiative of \r\nthe heads of Governments of Spain and Turkey, has \r\nbeen a clear reflection of this concern. Its main \r\nobjective is to promote in a practical manner \r\nunderstanding and cooperation among States and \r\npeoples of all cultures and religions within the \r\nframework of the principles and values of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights. \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations is a political \r\ninitiative of preventive diplomacy that, as was \r\nexpressed yesterday by the Secretary-General in his \r\nstatement before this Assembly, aspires to overcome \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 14 \r\n \r\nconflicts stemming from misperceptions of different \r\ncultures and religions, with no interference in \r\ninterreligious dialogue as such, which properly belongs \r\nto the representatives of the confessions themselves. \r\n In a first phase, the Alliance has focused its \r\nefforts in exploring the root causes of the polarization \r\nof cultures and societies throughout the world and in \r\nproposing practical recommendations to counteract \r\nforces that unfortunately cause an increase in \r\nradicalism and extremism, which can lead to violence. \r\n With the appointment by the Secretary-General of \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio as High Representative for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, a second stage begins, the \r\ncornerstone of which is the development of an action \r\nplan for 2007-2009. The plan includes a group of \r\nspecific measures in projects relating to four \r\nfundamental areas: youth, media, education and \r\nmigration. \r\n The first forum of the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nwas held in Madrid on 15 and 16 January 2008, and it \r\nbrought together more than 500 participants, including \r\npolitical leaders and representatives of Governments \r\nand international organizations, as well as members of \r\nvarious groups of civil society, including religious \r\ncommunities and media and business leaders. \r\n The report submitted to the Secretary-General by \r\nthe High Representative for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, Mr. Sampaio, and distributed to the \r\nGeneral Assembly in document A/63/336, contains the \r\nresults of the first Madrid forum as well as the main \r\nactivities of the Alliance during its first year of work. \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations is achieving \r\nsignificant progress and I am convinced that the second \r\nforum to be held in April 2009 in Istanbul will \r\nconstitute a fundamental milestone in the important \r\nroad ahead. Furthermore, the great number of countries \r\nand organizations that are actively participating \r\nhighlights the fact that States and civil society wish to \r\npromote all those initiatives for dialogue and \r\ncooperation that foster understanding and tolerance \r\namong our peoples. \r\n Consequently, I am confident that, in the near \r\nfuture, the General Assembly will be able to renew its \r\nsupport and impetus to the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nand to its important activities. I am convinced that it \r\nwill strengthen the values of dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation necessary for the progressive building \r\nof a real culture of peace in the world. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to the chair of the delegation of Brazil.  \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): I wish to congratulate the \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King \r\nAbdullah Bin AbdulAziz Al Saud, for his initiative to \r\nconvene this high-level meeting. Building a culture of \r\npeace through dialogue among civilizations, cultures \r\nand religions is a concrete way of giving effect to the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. I also welcome the significant contributions \r\nmade by a number of Member States to such dialogue \r\nthrough initiatives such as the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, in which Brazil is particularly active. \r\nThose initiatives complement each other. The United \r\nNations is well placed to help establish synergies \r\namong them.  \r\n As we all know, the relations among cultures and \r\nreligions have a long history, a history with bright \r\nspots and somber moments, like that of human \r\nexistence itself. The task before us today is to help \r\nbuild on that history so as to bring about enhanced \r\nunderstanding, mutual respect and cooperation. \r\nAchieving such a goal has become an imperative in a \r\nworld that is not only globalized but also populated by \r\nincreasingly diverse societies.  \r\n In several countries, multiculturalism is not a \r\nchoice but a reflection of either complex historical \r\nprocesses or evolving social structures. Long-term \r\nstability in those countries can only be achieved in an \r\nenvironment of peaceful coexistence of different \r\ncultural backgrounds. Their ultimate success as \r\nsocieties depends on their ability to progressively \r\nintegrate all citizens into a larger whole, richer than the \r\nsum of its original parts. \r\n A similar logic should prevail at the international \r\nlevel. The multiplicity of cultures certainly poses \r\nchallenges. However, once the community of nations \r\nvalues cultural diversity as a sign of collective \r\nstrength, those challenges will be more easily \r\novercome. This is a task for which the United Nations \r\nseems particularly well prepared. \r\n Building peace through religious tolerance and \r\ninter-faith dialogue is also an imperative in an age \r\nmarked by both secularism and religious \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n15 08-60077 \r\n \r\nfundamentalism. The foundations of such dialogue rest \r\non deep-rooted values shared by all religions: the \r\npursuit of peace and virtue, human solidarity and the \r\nfundamental dignity of each and every individual. \r\nToday all creeds are also united in their refusal to be \r\nmisused as political tools or as an excuse to justify \r\nviolence and extremism, and in their willingness to \r\novercome past prejudices and deepen their mutual \r\nunderstanding. \r\n Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n States have a role to play in supporting \r\ninterreligious dialogue and cooperation. By upholding \r\nthe freedoms of thought, expression and religion, \r\nGovernments help to create an environment of \r\ntolerance and understanding. By attaching equal \r\nimportance to these fundamental freedoms and by \r\nacting accordingly, public authorities show that liberty \r\nand the respect for religion can and must be reconciled. \r\n Balancing civil liberties is not the only \r\ncontribution that Governments can make to the \r\nharmonious coexistence of faiths. They should also \r\naddress the underdevelopment and social exclusion that \r\noften compound conflicts among faithful of different \r\nreligions. It is no secret that extremists of all kinds, \r\nincluding religious extremists, thrive where material \r\ndestitution and hopelessness fuel intolerance and \r\nviolence. \r\n Such beliefs rest on Brazil\u0027s experience as a \r\nnation and as a society. Ethnic, cultural and religious \r\ndiversity lie at the very heart of our national identity. \r\nWe know by experience that respect for diversity \r\nenriches and strengthens us. We know that the peaceful \r\ncoexistence of populations from all continents, each \r\nwith its cultural and ethnic background, and of people \r\nof different faiths have progressively instilled in our \r\nnational character a strong inclination for \r\naccommodating those different from ourselves and an \r\naversion to all kinds of extremism. Communities of \r\nJewish and Arab descent, for example, have always \r\nlived and live today side by side in harmony in our \r\ncountry. This experience reinforces our strong support \r\nfor the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination \r\nand to an independent and sovereign State, \r\ngeographically coherent and economically viable, \r\nliving side by side with Israel, within secure and \r\nrecognized borders. \r\n Other important contributions to a solid culture of \r\npeace in Brazil are the historic progress in reducing \r\npoverty and social inequality and our sustained efforts \r\nto improve basic and secondary education. We are \r\nconvinced that more prosperous and educated citizens \r\nare less prone to intolerance and extremism. President \r\nLula instituted 21 January as the National Day Against \r\nReligious Intolerance as a way to further strengthen the \r\nexisting relationships of mutual respect and \r\nunderstanding among different creeds and their \r\nfollowers in our country. \r\n The key concepts of respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms and promotion of development \r\nand social inclusiveness form the foundation of a world \r\nwhere civilizations, cultures and religions can flourish \r\npeacefully side by side and cooperate for the good of \r\nall. Let us all renew our commitment to those powerful \r\nideals and translate them into concrete action. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nTunisia. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould like to express our delegation’s sense of pride in \r\nparticipating in this high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly held under agenda item 45, entitled “Culture \r\nof peace”, which today deals with the question of \r\ninterfaith dialogue. I take this opportunity to express \r\nmy gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations for his report (A/63/262) on interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace and the important information it contains \r\nabout various regional and international activities and \r\ninitiatives in the areas of dialogue among religions and \r\ncultures.  \r\n I must also express profound appreciation and \r\ngratitude to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, \r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, for \r\nhis initiative in convening this significant meeting. And \r\nI am grateful to the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor the attention and significance he has accorded this \r\nevent. \r\n The world over the past two decades has \r\nwitnessed a drastic and unprecedentedly fast-paced \r\ntransformation that has created new balances of power, \r\nnew concepts and new challenges that cannot be \r\nignored. Observing the events that have taken place \r\nsince the early 1990s, one is stunned by some strange \r\npoints of view that theorize about conflict, the clash of \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 16 \r\n \r\ncivilizations, the end of history, and selectivity in \r\ndealing with different cultures. All of this way \r\nfollowed by events that precipitated many violent \r\nreactions which escalated and provoked feelings of \r\nhatred and bigotry. These sentiments were exploited by \r\nextremists on both sides and were used to incite strife, \r\nhatred and the rejection of the other and to advocate \r\nextremism and the use of religion as a pretext for \r\nviolence and terrorism. All these developments, in our \r\nview, amount to a qualitative setback on the path of \r\nhuman progress. \r\n In addition, the spread of tension and conflict, the \r\ninability to find mutual and fair solutions for \r\noutstanding international issues, including the question \r\nof Palestine, as well as the profoundly unfair imbalance \r\nin the economy, the sciences and modern technologies, \r\nplace international relations in a position of uncertainty \r\nand causes great concern and creates mistrust and lack \r\nof confidence. This compels us to think about new \r\nways for rapprochement among States, peoples and \r\nindividuals and requires creating a new code of \r\nconduct and behaviour in line with these \r\ntransformations and challenges. \r\n Tunisia is very attentive to the question of \r\ninterfaith dialogue. This is based on our belief that \r\nworld peace can be built only on dialogue, tolerance \r\nand understanding and that all countries, civilizations \r\nand religions teach tolerance and are more than capable \r\nof contributing to the development of mutual human \r\nvalues, which can act as a strong tool in bringing \r\ntogether nations and peoples and in helping them \r\novercome their disputes and difficulties. Achieving this \r\nnoble objective requires that we remain open to each \r\nother, that we avoid prejudging or holding one-\r\ndimensional views, eschew intolerance, bigotry and \r\nattempts to distort and slander under the pretext of \r\nfreedom of expression. \r\n Faced with these new challenges, it is important \r\nfor everyone to join together to sensitize international \r\npublic opinion and turn it away from the escalating \r\nwaves of violence and extremism, thus encouraging it \r\nto conduct a frank dialogue — one that rejects close-\r\nmindedness and the exclusion of others. \r\n Because we believe that the inability of the \r\nindividual to take advantage of knowledge provides \r\nfertile ground for extremism and bigotry, Tunisia began \r\na reform process in the early 1990s in its school \r\ncurricula and has implemented a number of measures \r\nin family, societal and media reform to emphasize and \r\nstrengthen the vales of tolerance, dialogue and \r\ncoexistence to build a firm foundation of thinking \r\nabout behaviour. Among other measures taken, we are \r\nproud of the constitutional reform we implemented in \r\n2002, which has strengthened the principles of \r\ntolerance and cooperation in our Republic’s \r\nConstitution.  \r\n Alongside the reform measures, under the \r\nleadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, \r\nTunisia has added its efforts to those of the \r\ninternational community to strengthen understanding \r\namong peoples, cultures and religions and to \r\nstrengthen the culture of dialogue as the best \r\nframework to renounce the heritage of misconceptions, \r\nhatred and racism. We have carried out a number of \r\nnew initiatives and approaches, including the 1995 \r\nCarthage Compact for Tolerance, in cooperation with \r\nUNESCO, and the creation in 2001 of the Ben Ali \r\nChair for Dialogue among Civilizations and Religions — \r\nan academically endowed post designed to provide \r\nsufficient intellectual ground to support peace and \r\ndevelopment in all regions and continents. In \r\nDecember 1972 we also created the Republic’s \r\nInternational Prize for Islamic Studies to enrich new \r\ninterpretive thinking in our religion. Another initiative, \r\ncreated in May 2005, was the Tunisia forum for peace, \r\nin cooperation with the General Secretary of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. In June 2005, \r\nwe established a Centre for Study and Research for \r\nCompetitive Dialogue among Civilizations and \r\nreligions, followed by the Declaration of Tunisia for \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations in February 2006 at the \r\nend of an international seminar that was organized in \r\ncooperation with the Islamic Educational, Scientific \r\nand Cultural Organization. \r\n Tunisia will continue supporting these initiatives, \r\nbased on its deep belief in the need to unite the efforts \r\nof all in order to consolidate the culture of dialogue, \r\nopenness and tolerance. \r\n We note with appreciation a growing awareness \r\nof the importance of dialogue locally, regionally and \r\ninternationally; but we also see that such dialogue can \r\nbe fruitful only if all parties keep it honest, credible \r\nand noble. In order for our dialogue to remain balanced \r\nand fruitful, we must support and activate international \r\norganizations and exert greater efforts to deal with the \r\ncauses of tension and strife, including the elimination \r\nof poverty and marginalization through a new \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n17 08-60077 \r\n \r\nmomentum for the mechanisms of cooperation among \r\nStates, such as the World Solidarity Fund, established \r\nby General Assembly resolution 57/265 in 2002. The \r\n2005 World Summit called for its activation so that it \r\ncould help in combating poverty, thereby eliminating \r\nthe growing gap among nations and the deepening \r\nsense of frustration and exclusion. \r\n Today we are in great need of overcoming the \r\nbipolarity and duality of conflict between East and \r\nWest, North and South. We must get rid of the \r\nmisunderstandings that have accumulated among \r\nnations and acknowledge the human dimension of all \r\ncultures, religions and civilizations. We must \r\nacknowledge that the security, stability and prosperity \r\nof States is itself the security and prosperity of the \r\nentire world. We must deepen the universal aspects of \r\nour thinking, behaviour and relations with others, \r\nregardless of the specific details of our faiths or \r\ncultures so that humankind can remain united in \r\ndialogue, cooperation, understanding and solidarity as \r\nit confronts the common challenges and risks that face \r\nus all. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nChina. \r\n Mr. Zhang Yesui (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation supports the initiative of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to hold a high-level \r\nplenary discussion under the agenda item entitled \r\n“Culture of peace”, in response to the initiative by His \r\nMajesty King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. We are \r\nconvinced that this debate will help further interfaith \r\nand intercultural dialogue and cooperation and enhance \r\nmutual understanding and harmonious coexistence \r\namong Member States. \r\n Religious and cultural diversity is an asset of \r\nhuman society and an important driving force for \r\nsocial development, cultural exchange and world \r\npeace. In today’s world, global problems present more \r\npronounced challenges, such as terrorism, climate \r\nchange, food and the energy and finance crises, which \r\npose grave threats to human development. The fates of \r\nall countries are more closely interlinked than ever \r\nbefore. \r\n At the same time, racial and religious \r\ndiscrimination has led to unprecedented collisions and \r\nshocks among cultures and civilizations. The \r\ninternational community is faced not only with the \r\nshared responsibility to enhance cooperation in coping \r\nwith challenges, but also with the daunting task of \r\nminimizing differences and seeking common ground. \r\nAgainst this backdrop, it has become all the more \r\nimportant to strengthen interfaith and intercultural \r\ndialogue and cooperation and all the more urgent to \r\nbuild a harmonious world. \r\n China stands for the promotion of equality among \r\ndifferent religions and cultures on the basis of mutual \r\nrespect. The various religions and cultures originated \r\nand developed at different times in history, but there is, \r\nhowever, no difference as far as their status is \r\nconcerned. All religions and cultures are the \r\ncrystallization of human wisdom and have contributed \r\nto the progress and development of human society. As \r\nsuch, they deserve equal respect. Different religions \r\nand cultures ought, in a spirit of openness and \r\nsincerity, to learn from each other’s strengths and live \r\nin peaceful coexistence. \r\n China advocates respecting differences in order to \r\npeacefully address conflicts, which often originate in \r\nalienation, discrimination, fear and even hatred caused \r\nby differences. The Chinese Government has always \r\nopposed extremism and all forms of discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and intolerance based on religion, race or \r\nany other grounds, as well as the attempt to link \r\nterrorism to a specific nation, ethnicity or religion. \r\n We are concerned with the resurgence of \r\nextremism, such as Islamophobia and new forms of \r\nfascism. We believe that the international community \r\nshould work towards the long-term resolution of \r\nconflicts in regional hotspots, eliminate the \r\nestrangement, misunderstanding and disputes among \r\nreligions and cultures through initiatives based on the \r\nprinciples of mutual respect, mutual benefit, equality \r\nand cooperation and the seeking of win-win outcomes \r\nand joint development. \r\n China believes that education is a useful means to \r\nhelp young people adopt a correct perception of \r\ncivilization and the world. Young people are the future \r\nof the humankind. Efforts to create a harmonious world \r\nmust start with the young generation. National \r\nGovernments should take the primary responsibility \r\nand introduce long-term and effective measures to \r\nspread the philosophy of a culture of peace, such as \r\ntolerance, understanding and respect, while fostering \r\nthe ability of fend off racial hatred and fight \r\ndiscrimination. \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 18 \r\n \r\n China believes that the media should voluntarily \r\ntake upon themselves the social responsibility to be the \r\nmessengers of a culture of peace and promote \r\ntolerance, understanding and harmony in society. The \r\nmedia, as the carriers of information should seek the \r\nspeedy dissemination of information to the public but \r\nmust also pay attention to the quality of information \r\ndisseminated. They should transmit healthy and \r\ntruthful information that upholds the moral standards \r\nand conceptions of justice in society. Additionally, the \r\nmedia should refrain from disseminating provocative \r\nand insulting comments that trigger confrontation \r\namong religions and cultures. \r\n The five-thousand year history of Chinese \r\ncivilization shows that religion and culture can be \r\npositive factors in a society’s harmonious development. \r\nChina is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country. In \r\nChina, 56 ethnic groups treat each other equally. Main \r\nreligions like Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, and \r\nChristianity coexist harmoniously and grow \r\ncontinuously. \r\n The Chinese culture advocates harmony and \r\naccord. From ancient sages such as Confucius and \r\nMencius to pioneers of democracy in modern history, \r\nideas such as “harmony”, “harmonious but different” \r\nand “working together with one accord in time of \r\ndifficulties” have been among the main elements of \r\ntheir thinking. Throughout the history of its \r\ndevelopment, Chinese civilization has been imbued \r\nwith the spirit of harmony, which has, as its essence, \r\nmutual recognition, mutual respect, the search for \r\ncommonalities — while putting aside differences — \r\nand coexistence and common growth. \r\n The People’s Republic of China’s Constitution \r\nhas established the principles of the freedom of \r\nreligious belief, the equality of all religions and the \r\nseparation of church and State. China respects the \r\nfreedom of religion, pursues the policy of autonomy in \r\nhandling religious affairs and has promulgated the \r\n“Regulations on Religious Affairs”, the purpose of \r\nwhich is to maintain religious and social harmony. \r\n China’s religious community takes an active part \r\nin international cooperation and has hosted a number \r\nof international forums, such as the World Buddhist \r\nForum and the International Forum on Taoism. This \r\nyear, the China Buddhist Association, the Taoist \r\nAssociation and the Islamic Association took an active \r\npart in the World Conference on Dialogue co-hosted by \r\nthe Kings of Saudi Arabia and Spain. We support this \r\ninitiative and expect it to continue to evolve in a \r\nhealthy and in-depth way and to make greater \r\ncontributions to the facilitation of interfaith and \r\nintercultural understanding. \r\n China advocates the building of a harmonious \r\nsociety and world and firmly supports and actively \r\nparticipates in the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to promote interfaith and intercultural \r\ndialogue and cooperation. In 2007, the Third Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting (ASEM) Interfaith Dialogue was held \r\nin China and adopted the Nanjing Statement on \r\nInterfaith Dialogue. \r\n The Chinese Government also participates in a \r\nconstructive manner in multiple initiatives and \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations related to dialogue \r\namong civilizations, including the Year of Dialogue \r\nAmong Civilizations, the Alliance of Civilizations and \r\nthe Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for \r\nPeace. \r\n The British philosopher Bertrand Russell said, \r\n“Contacts between different civilizations have often in \r\nthe past proved to be landmarks in human progress”. \r\nWe hope that the relevant initiatives and mechanisms \r\ncan create synergy by complementing each other so as \r\nto form a bridge of communication and cooperation \r\nwith a view to promoting the common development of \r\nhuman society and helping to build a better, more \r\nharmonious world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor the chairman of the delegation of \r\nCanada. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment of Canada, I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia for their initiative in organizing this \r\nplenary meeting on dialogue between religions and \r\ncultures. \r\n Since its inception, the United Nations has \r\nprovided a forum to bring the countries and people of \r\nthe world together. It has promoted constructive \r\ndialogue across cultures and faiths, which has \r\ncontributed to greater mutual understanding. Initiatives \r\nsuch as this discussion demonstrate that the nations of \r\nthe world recognize the importance of their shared \r\nresponsibility to promote intercultural dialogue, an \r\nobjective that Canada is proud to support. \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n19 08-60077 \r\n \r\n While the world offers many examples of \r\nsuccessful multi-ethnic, multi-faith, and multicultural \r\ncommunities that coexist and benefit from their \r\ninteraction, too often such differences are considered \r\ngrounds for competition or triggers for armed conflict. \r\nWe must all work to change such mistaken perceptions. \r\nDiversity is a valuable asset and a source of \r\nopportunity, not a threat. \r\n Throughout Canada’s history, the accommodation \r\nof regional, ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity \r\nhas been critical to our overall health as a country. \r\nMany of the values that Canadians hold dear — \r\nfreedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law — \r\nhave evolved through an ongoing dialogue among the \r\ncultures and communities that make up our diverse \r\nsociety. \r\n Openness to diversity and intercultural dialogue \r\nhas strengthened Canadian society and enriched our \r\nculture. We have long benefited from the cultural \r\ninfluence of British, French and aboriginal populations, \r\nas well as the skills, languages, cultures, religions and \r\nother contributions of more than 200 ethno-cultural \r\ncommunities in Canada. This diversity is reflected in \r\nand reinforced by the official multiculturalism policy. \r\n Canada fosters pluralism through laws, \r\ninstitutions and policies that promote the equal \r\nparticipation of all people in society. At the same time, \r\nwe encourage peoples to retain their cultural, linguistic \r\nand religious heritage. We do so not just through \r\nfederal, provincial and municipal Governments, but \r\nalso through academia, the media, religious groups, \r\ncommunity organizations and civil society.  \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Of course, the promotion of pluralism and \r\ndialogue among religions and cultures must be pursued \r\nbeyond national boundaries. Moreover, the \r\ninternational community must not limit its efforts to \r\nmere dialogue; it must also take concrete steps to \r\npromote increased intercultural understanding and \r\nrespect for people with other cultural and religious \r\nbackgrounds. That is why such initiatives as the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, which have identified \r\nconcrete measures concerning young people, the \r\nmedia, education and migration, are so important in \r\ncombating ignorance, a potential source of cross-\r\ncultural misunderstanding. It was to further that \r\nobjective that Canada also partnered with the Aga \r\nKhan Development Network to establish a Global \r\nCentre for Pluralism. The Centre’s mission is to \r\npromote pluralism as a fundamental value and a basis \r\nfor peace, stability and human development.  \r\n In conclusion, within the framework of this \r\ninitiative and other programmes, Canada is committed \r\nto working together with the international community \r\nto enhance intercultural dialogue and understanding \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the representative of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Domínguez Martínez (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Permit me at the outset to express my \r\nappreciation for the holding of this important meeting \r\npromoted by His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia, \r\nwhich is a new step forward in the promotion of a \r\nculture of peace.  \r\n The principal goals set out in the Charter of the \r\nOrganization are “to save succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war” and to create a democratic and \r\nequitable international order based on respect for the \r\ndignity of all human beings on an equal basis. Those \r\nwere the founding objectives of the Organization to \r\nwhich we belong. Its purposes are the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security on the basis of the \r\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of all its Members, \r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes, \r\nrefraining from the threat or use of force and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. We \r\nwere promised that all peoples would achieve \r\neconomic and social progress. \r\n We are witnessing an extremely grave global \r\nfinancial, energy and food crisis, which, together with \r\nenvironmental degradation and the effects of climate \r\nchange, inter alia, reflect a sad economic and social \r\npanorama that endangers the human species, \r\nparticularly in developing countries. The lives of \r\nmillions of human beings living on the planet are also \r\nthreatened by the unilateralism of the world’s only \r\nsuper-Power, which in recent years has based its \r\nactions on the so-called doctrine of the clash of \r\ncivilizations, demonizing venerable cultures and \r\nreligions. \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations is the only way to \r\naddress unilateralism and neo-liberal globalization, \r\nwhich seek to keep the countries of the South \r\nunderdeveloped and to homogenize and dominate their \r\ncultures. Cuba reaffirms the ideals of our national hero, \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 20 \r\n \r\nJosé Martí, who, in the nineteenth century, proclaimed \r\nthe need to achieve an equitable world. On the basis of \r\nthat premise, we must work together to find joint \r\nresponses to the challenges of the modern world and to \r\nachieve a culture of peace. \r\n Cuba reaffirms its support for multilateralism and \r\nmultilaterally agreed solutions, in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law, as \r\nthe only way to address international problems. Only \r\nthus will there be peace and development for all. We \r\nreaffirm the Declaration and Programme of Action on a \r\nCulture of Peace and the Global Agenda for Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations and its Programme of Action, and \r\nwe support UNESCO’s programmes and practical \r\ninitiatives in that regard. We believe that the activities \r\nplanned to commemorate the International Year for the \r\nRapprochement of Cultures in 2010 will also \r\ncontribute to the promotion of a culture of peace. \r\n Likewise, Cuba thanks the Government of \r\nPhilippines for offering to host the Special \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) Ministerial Meeting \r\non Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and \r\nDevelopment, to be held in Manila from 26 to 28 May \r\n2009. We also highlight the Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action adopted within the framework of \r\nthe NAM Ministerial Meeting on Human Rights and \r\nCultural Diversity, held in September 2007 in Iran. \r\n Every doctrine that is based on racial or cultural \r\nsuperiority must be strongly rejected. In recent years, a \r\nnumber of countries have identified certain cultures \r\nand religions with terrorism and violence. Those views \r\nmust not be tolerated. We must reject any action \r\ninvolving racial harm, discrimination, stereotyping and \r\nracial profiling, or the defamation of religions against \r\nhuman dignity, equality and justice. \r\n Cuba reiterates that the diversity of political, \r\nsocial, cultural and religious systems must be respected \r\nin order to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful \r\nand prosperous world, a just and equitable world order \r\nand an environment conducive to the sharing of human \r\nexperience.  \r\n We believe that the study of diverse cultures and \r\ncivilizations in educational curriculums, including the \r\nteaching of the languages, histories and sociopolitical \r\nphilosophies of various civilizations, as well as the \r\nsharing of knowledge and information, contribute to \r\nthe promotion of a culture of peace. We also highlight \r\nthe role of the media in spreading human values as \r\nwell as the need to promote responsibility and ethical \r\nconduct on the part of the media in order to contribute \r\nto mutual respect among diverse civilizations. Cuba is \r\nconvinced that together we can share the belief that a \r\nbetter world is possible. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express to the Assembly our \r\ndeep appreciation for the honourable initiative to hold \r\nthis high-level meeting to encourage interfaith and \r\nintercultural dialogue. By the same token, we express \r\nour appreciation and gratitude to the Custodian of the \r\nTwo Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al \r\nSaud, who called for this meeting as part of His \r\nMajesty’s inspiring initiative to foster dialogue among \r\nreligions and cultures in order to create a world where \r\nunderstanding and a climate of coexistence and mutual \r\nacceptance are the norm. This was demonstrated earlier \r\nthrough his sponsorship of the Mecca Conference and \r\nthe Madrid Conference held last June. These \r\nconferences made contributions that have proved to \r\nprovide a great impetus towards improved interfaith \r\nand interreligious dialogue, which in turn can be \r\nactivated through programmes of action and priorities, \r\ntranslating the recommendations of those conferences \r\ninto living reality. \r\n This high-level meeting is the culmination of \r\nnumerous initiatives calling for supportive dialogue \r\namong civilizations in lieu of the extremist views that \r\nfavour the clash of civilizations and the end of history. \r\nThe latter visions are exclusive and rigidly unilateral. \r\nThey belittle the perspectives and choices of others and \r\nimpose narrow models on everyone else.  \r\n Interfaith and interreligious dialogue is a true \r\nsubstitute for ethnic, cultural and civilizational \r\nsuperiority. It constitutes a positive movement forward \r\nfor the sake of humanity. The United Nations, in \r\naccordance with its Charter, calls for joint efforts to \r\nfoster friendly relations, create an ideal human society, \r\ndeepen dialogue and use such dialogue as a means of \r\ncontact among peoples and as an opportunity to \r\nexchange experience, benefits and learning.  \r\n At the end of 1994, the Director-General of the \r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization (UNESCO) made a declaration for \r\ntolerance and the spread of the culture of peace. That \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n21 08-60077 \r\n \r\nwas on the eve of the United Nations Year for \r\nTolerance (1995), which had been proclaimed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in resolution 48/126. The United \r\nNations continued its efforts along those lines through \r\nthe year 2001, which had been declared the United \r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations \r\n(resolution 53/22), in keeping with its ongoing belief in \r\nthe important role of dialogue in bringing together \r\ndifferent cultures and religions and building on \r\ncommon denominators, with a view to achieving \r\npeaceful coexistence and cooperation among nations \r\nand peoples. \r\n The United Nations is called upon to redouble its \r\nefforts to strengthen and raise the level of interfaith \r\nand interreligious dialogue by supporting the outcomes \r\nand findings of the numerous initiatives and \r\nconferences in this field. In this regard, we should \r\ncontinue our concerted efforts to rein in radical \r\nextreme practices and trends that insult prophets, \r\nreligions and religious symbols. We should decisively \r\ncondemn such practices and trends, because they fan \r\nthe flames of enmity among peoples and religions, \r\ndeepen the divide and lead to an angry climate that \r\nundermines efforts aimed at encouraging interfaith and \r\nintercultural dialogue.  \r\n We see the need to respect cultural and \r\ncivilizational diversity. Accordingly, we should \r\nemphasize respect for the rights of communities and \r\nimmigrants to decent living conditions, particularly \r\nwith the emergence of radical trends in some Western \r\nStates calling for their exclusion and marginalization, \r\nthereby depriving them of their political, cultural and \r\nsocio-economic rights. Such deprivation is a form of \r\nracism and racial discrimination and an expression of \r\nattitudes of ethnic and cultural superiority. All of these \r\nphenomena are negative, dangerous, impede dialogue \r\nand should be dealt with decisively; indeed, we should \r\ncondemn them in order to create a climate conducive to \r\ntolerance and understanding. \r\n The Sudan will continue to support initiatives for \r\ndialogue among religions and cultures, as well as \r\ninitiatives launched in this area in order to achieve a \r\nworld characterized by amity, peace and coexistence. \r\nThis attitude forms part of our country’s contribution, \r\ngiven its rich cultural diversity and geographic \r\nlocation, and constitutes part of our social and cultural \r\nfabric in which real human action and contact can take \r\nplace. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): My delegation \r\nwishes to thank the Secretary-General for the reports \r\nbefore us entitled “Interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace” \r\n(A/63/262) and “International Decade for a Culture of \r\nPeace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World, \r\n2001–2010” (A/63/127). Indonesia is also deeply \r\nappreciative of the work of the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \r\n(UNESCO) and other institutions of the United Nations \r\nsystem, as well as the ongoing efforts of the Tripartite \r\nForum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace and the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations to promote a culture of peace. \r\n Indonesia attaches great importance to the \r\ninitiatives of Member States to promote respect for \r\ndiversity, freedom, justice, tolerance and cooperation, \r\nas these principles are all important building blocks for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nIndonesia appreciates the importance of the process \r\nresulting from the World Conference on Dialogue \r\nwhich was held last July in Madrid under the patronage \r\nof the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King \r\nAbdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and King Juan Carlos \r\nI of Spain. \r\n Efforts to promote a culture of peace represent an \r\nimportant part of the interaction among all cultures and \r\ncivilizations. In our view, interfaith and intercultural \r\ndialogue and cooperation are particularly significant \r\nwhen considered against the backdrop of our volatile \r\nworld today. As we have seen, when ethnic and \r\nreligious prejudices are compounded by economic, \r\npolitical or other rivalries, the resulting situation can \r\nbe explosive. We believe that faith-related conflicts are \r\nmore likely to occur when the extremism of a few \r\ntriumphs over the moderation of the overwhelming \r\nmajority. \r\n Moderation is an inherent component of the \r\nIndonesian way of life, developed over the years as a \r\nresponse to the pluralism of the peoples of our \r\narchipelago. We have a culture that encourages broad \r\nconsultation. We have had centuries of practice in the \r\nart of dialogue and fostering tolerance. This approach \r\nis our way of coping with the immense variety of our \r\nethnic traditions. \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 22 \r\n \r\n We also see tolerance as an imperative in human \r\nand social development. In fact, for us, development is \r\nnot purely an economic process. It is not enough \r\nsimply to attempt to lift people out of their poverty. We \r\nmust also redeem them from narrow-mindedness, \r\nprejudice and intolerance. That means that there can be \r\nno true development without a broad educational \r\nprocess that enables all persons to see themselves not \r\nonly in terms of their own religion, but in terms of the \r\nfaiths of others. And thus we managed to weave, from \r\nthe many strands of our ethnic cultures and traditions, \r\nthe single fabric of our nationhood. That is also how \r\nwe deal with the fact that, since ancient times, many \r\nreligions have found a home on Indonesian soil. Our \r\nattainment of unity in spite of our diversity is \r\ncelebrated in our national motto: “Bhinneka tunggal \r\nika”. We are diverse and yet we are one. \r\n Beyond our national boundaries, we believe that \r\ndialogue among peoples, cultures, faiths and \r\ncivilizations is essential to the growth of a global \r\nculture of peace. It is with this philosophy in mind that \r\nIndonesia has launched and participates in various \r\nkinds of dialogue among faiths, cultures and \r\ncivilizations. In 2004, we initiated the Asia-Pacific \r\nRegional Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation and, in \r\n2005, we organized the Asia-Europe Interfaith \r\nDialogue. Both dialogues have now become major \r\nannual events. We have also launched bilateral \r\ninterfaith initiatives with countries of different cultures \r\nsuch as Australia, New Zealand, the Vatican, Canada, \r\nthe Netherlands and the United Kingdom. \r\n In recognition of the role of the mass media in \r\ncombating ignorance and prejudice among faiths, \r\ncultures and civilizations, we have also initiated a \r\nseries of global inter-media dialogues, with Norway as \r\nour co-sponsor, to sensitize the mass media to become \r\nan effective instrument for the promotion of mutual \r\nunderstanding and appreciation among the world\u0027s \r\ndifferent faiths and cultures. \r\n Furthermore, in the belief that interfaith dialogue \r\nis too important to be left to the good work of \r\nGovernments, we encourage the role that \r\nnongovernmental actors can play in the quest for \r\nharmony. In that light, the Government of Indonesia \r\nhas supported the initiatives of various civil society \r\ngroups, including the International Conference of \r\nIslamic Scholars, which is sponsored by Nandlatul \r\nUlama, the largest Muslim organization in Indonesia, \r\nand the World Peace Forum, which is hosted by \r\nMuhammadiyah, the second largest Muslim \r\norganization in the country. We are hopeful that all \r\nthose initiatives will not only complement but also \r\nstrengthen other activities addressing the same subject. \r\nIndeed, we hope they become an important part of the \r\nglobal web of cooperation aimed at promoting faith-\r\nbased peace and harmony.  \r\n It is important to recognize, however, that \r\nconference room dialogue is not the only forum for the \r\nexchange of views or for finding a common platform. \r\nThere are daily practices at the grassroots level that are \r\nworth appreciating and encouraging. In our respective \r\nsocieties, we may witness people of different faiths and \r\nreligions conducting dialogues by helping each other in \r\nbuilding their houses of worship or common schools. \r\nSimilarly, there is the dialogue of teaching, when \r\nchildren at school are exposed to other faiths and \r\ncultures. In these activities, we identify a dialogue of \r\naction, a dialogue of life and a dialogue of teaching. \r\n In the globalized and interdependent world of \r\ntoday, economic, social and cultural issues could \r\ncontribute significantly to peace and security. Ensuring \r\na fair economy, social justice and harmonious cultural \r\nrelationships is a significant part of that. Bridges \r\namong peoples and groups must be encouraged and \r\nconstructed. \r\n It is in this context that our delegation supports \r\nthe draft resolution introduced by Her Excellency \r\nGloria Macapagal-Arroyo, President of the Philippines, \r\nentitled “Promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace” \r\n(A/63/L.24/Rev.1). We look forward to the adoption of \r\nthis draft resolution by consensus. \r\n Our delegation also supports the draft resolution \r\nto be introduced by the representative of Bangladesh, \r\nentitled “International Decade for a Culture of Peace \r\nand Non-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010” (A/63/L.23). We also look forward to its \r\nadoption by consensus. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nNorway. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): I am heartened to speak \r\nafter my good friend, the Ambassador from Indonesia, \r\na country with which Norway is conducting an inter-\r\nmedia dialogue and, in practical terms, is building \r\nbridges between countries, religions, Islam and \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n23 08-60077 \r\n \r\nChristianity. And we will continue to do that in both \r\nour regions of the world, reaching across the possible \r\ngap between us.  \r\n Norway believes that the United Nations is built \r\non the principle that it is dialogue and mutual respect \r\nthat must govern relations between the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations. We are here to find shared interests, to \r\ndefend values, to bridge our differences and to settle \r\nthem peacefully. We are also the guardians of the \r\nhuman rights and the fundamental freedoms, State \r\nrights, majority rights and, not least, minority rights, \r\nwhich we have adopted in the course of 63 years. We \r\nare an organization where, as John F. Kennedy said, the \r\nstrong shall be just and the weak secure. \r\n The laudable initiative of Saudi Arabia, which \r\nhas given us the opportunity to discuss dialogue \r\nbetween religions and culture for two days in this \r\nAssembly, comes at a timely moment in history. \r\nGlobalization, migration and information technology \r\nhave made it clear to us that we have become very \r\nmuch closer to people and cultures that were perceived \r\nas being far away from our daily lives only decades \r\nago. We may not yet have fully learnt to rejoice in the \r\nrichness of diversity or to learn with an open mind \r\nfrom the best of others. This is also the case in my own \r\ncountry, which is relatively new to the broad canvas of \r\ncultural and religious diversity and where we are \r\nlearning every day and working politically to integrate \r\nimmigrants and refugees in a manner that is respectful \r\nof their identity and experience. We aim to become a \r\nfully inclusive society, where everybody feels welcome \r\nand where everybody may live to achieve their goals \r\nand aspirations. \r\n Although we believe that religious faith is an \r\nissue that belongs to the individual and that all persons \r\nhave the inherent right to change religious faith and \r\nthat they should be allowed to practice their religion, \r\nor not to practice religion, without fear, we also believe \r\nthat religious communities have important roles to play \r\nin furthering dialogue and respect among religions and \r\ncultures. When it comes to the practical steps needed to \r\nimprove dialogue, we all need to start at home. \r\n If future generations are to be more successful in \r\nliving together and mutually respecting each other, we \r\nmust teach them respect from childhood. We need to \r\nlook at what we teach them in primary school about \r\nother peoples, cultures and religions, and we need to \r\nlook at what we do not teach them. School curricula \r\nare essential. \r\n As we prepare to celebrate the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, we must be guided in our dialogue by the \r\nfundamental freedoms enshrined in that Declaration. \r\nWe hold the firm view that freedom of religion cannot \r\nbe achieved without freedom of speech. And freedom \r\nof speech is a prerequisite for any valuable dialogue. A \r\ndialogue is not a dialogue but a shared monologue, if it \r\ndoes not encourage the expression of different views \r\nwithout fear. \r\n In my country, we have established a Council for \r\nReligion and Life Stance Communities, which meets \r\nwith the Government to exchange views. In the \r\nframework of the Council, participants inform each \r\nother of issues of mutual interest, including how \r\nopinions and public expressions are perceived among \r\npeople with different cultural backgrounds or religious \r\naffiliations. We can have freedom of expression while, \r\nin parallel, exercising caution so that we do not \r\ninadvertently or unnecessarily denigrate or disrespect \r\nwhat others hold dear. This attitude is taught in all \r\ncultures and practiced here in the United Nations every \r\nday. And it has nothing to do with censorship or legal \r\nrestriction, only with human consideration and respect. \r\n I conclude today with an example of that wisdom \r\nthat I just mentioned and which I believe is universal. \r\nMy example is taken from Hávamál, the 1,000-year-\r\nold Norse-Icelandic educational poem, which reads: \r\n “Wise is he not who is never silent, \r\n Mouthing meaningless words: \r\n A glib tongue that goes on chattering \r\n Sings to its own harm.” \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nPortugal. \r\n Mr. Salgueiro (Portugal): Portugal aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made yesterday by Mr. Alain Juppé \r\non behalf of the European Union. I would like to start \r\nmy statement by thanking the Custodian of the Two \r\nHoly Mosques, His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia, \r\nfor his noble efforts to promote dialogue among \r\nreligions and cultures. \r\n Much has already been said about interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue, but I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to reaffirm the importance of interreligious \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 24 \r\n \r\nand intercultural dialogue as crucial dimensions of the \r\ndialogue among civilizations and of the culture of \r\npeace. \r\n Allow me to underline that we value this occasion \r\nto learn more about regional or national initiatives or \r\nbest practices to encourage dialogue and mutual \r\nunderstanding. These initiatives are mutually \r\nreinforcing and interrelated, and my country, Portugal, \r\nvalues all efforts to foster a better understanding \r\namong peoples. It is indeed the absence of \r\nunderstanding that promotes intolerance, bigotry and \r\nextremism.  \r\n At the national level, we should not undervalue \r\nthe role of education. Indeed, Portugal is fully \r\nconvinced of the primary importance of education in \r\npromoting a culture of peace. It is by investing our \r\nefforts in the youngest members of our society, as well \r\nas in education through life that we can best \r\nmainstream the values of peace, tolerance and the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights for present \r\nand future generations. \r\n Portugal is in full agreement that the promotion \r\nof dialogue and understanding among cultures is \r\nessential to building a more peaceful world. This goal \r\ncan be achieved if human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms are fully protected and promoted. All human \r\nrights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and \r\ninterrelated, as stated in the 1993 Vienna Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action. Paragraph 5 of that \r\nDeclaration states: \r\n  “While the significance of national and \r\nregional particularities and various historical, \r\ncultural and religious backgrounds must be borne \r\nin mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of \r\ntheir political, economic and cultural systems, to \r\npromote and protect all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms.” \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n Portugal is part of the group of friends of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, initiated by the Governments \r\nof Spain and Turkey and now under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations, as mentioned yesterday by Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Ban Ki-moon. We firmly believe that the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations can play a central role in \r\nreinforcing dialogue at the global level. Indeed, more \r\nthan ever before, intercultural understanding is a \r\ncomplex task but also an essential element of both \r\ndomestic and international harmony. With its universal \r\nmembership, in terms of regional, cultural, linguistic \r\nand religious communities, the Alliance is a valuable \r\ntool that we must fully explore. \r\n By embracing diversity as a means of progress \r\nand building upon universal human rights, we can work \r\ntowards an effective culture of peace and provide a \r\nbetter world for coming generations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chair of the delegation of the \r\nGambia. \r\n Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo (Gambia): Please allow me to \r\nextend words of gratitude and commendation to King \r\nAbdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, the \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, for his vision and \r\nforesight in initiating this high-level meeting. Also, the \r\nUnited Nations sponsorship and promotion of the \r\nculture of peace and the dialogue among civilizations \r\nhas been and remains a major milestone in the history \r\nof human culture. \r\n Sixty years ago, the community of nations \r\nunanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, which remains a beacon of hope for \r\nhuman dignity and equality and the solid basis for \r\ndialogue across cultures and civilizations.  \r\n As defined by the United Nations, the culture of \r\npeace is a set of values, attitudes, modes of behaviour \r\nand ways of life that reject violence and prevent \r\nconflicts by tackling their root causes to solve \r\nproblems through dialogue and negotiation among \r\nindividuals, groups and nations. \r\n In terms of the preservation of human dignity and \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, the \r\nlast century was probably the bloodiest, given the \r\nnumber and ferocity of conflicts which caused untold \r\nsuffering. Most of those conflicts have ended. \r\nHowever, in certain hotspots, insecurity persists. \r\n Although we all harboured high hopes and great \r\nexpectations of the current millennium, conflicts, \r\nwhether political, religious or of another nature, \r\npersist. Unfortunately, these conflicts, which are due \r\nmainly to greed and avarice and sometimes to \r\nextremism, are contrary to the principles of the \r\nDeclaration and the Charter and the teachings of the \r\ngreat religions. \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n25 08-60077 \r\n \r\n Whereas sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment, environmental sustainability, poverty \r\neradication and sustainable food security are all vital \r\ningredients for the maintenance of peace and security \r\nand peaceful coexistence among peoples, the reality is \r\nother than that. Rapid population growth, rural/urban \r\nmigration leading to massive urbanization, the debt \r\nburden, climate change, food insecurity and the global \r\nfinancial crisis have rendered the bulk of the world’s \r\npopulation poorer and more vulnerable. A large \r\npercentage of these, no doubt, are made up of jobless \r\nyouth who are, for the most part, restless for change. \r\nWe all know that idle hands are the devil’s workshop. \r\n It is a travesty that, in spite of successes in all \r\nareas of human endeavour, including science, \r\ntechnology and medicine, and in spite of the abundance \r\nof wealth, food and natural resources in some parts of \r\nour planet, more than half of the world’s population \r\nstill wallows in abject poverty and is plagued by \r\ndisease, hunger and malnutrition. Let us stand together \r\nto eradicate these injustices, the root causes of conflict \r\nand violence. \r\n Cultivating a culture of peace and dialogue \r\namong civilizations must be underpinned by \r\ncomprehensive educational, social and civic actions. \r\nWorld leaders must commit to redirect resources from \r\nmilitary expenditures to investing in programmes that \r\nbring about development and human security. Of \r\nrecent, developing countries watched in amazement \r\nwhile the developed countries were dishing out trillions \r\nof United States dollars to bail out financial \r\ninstitutions, whereas their commitments to increase \r\nofficial development assistance to the developing \r\ncountries remain to a large extend unfulfilled. \r\n More than ever before, there is a need to build \r\nbridges of understanding, tolerance and solidarity \r\nacross civilizations, cultures and peoples. We must be \r\nresolute in the pursuit of interfaith dialogue and \r\ncooperation by seeking to increase knowledge and \r\nunderstanding of the world’s religions. We need to \r\nremind ourselves that three of those religions, Islam, \r\nJudaism and Christianity, whose adherents are often \r\nreferred to as the people of the Book, are all rooted in \r\nthe Abrahamic faith. As such, the focus should be on \r\nthe values shared, rather than on those things that tend \r\nto divide. Consequently, the media are encouraged to \r\nplay an enabling role through the dissemination of \r\nhelpful information to engender understanding, \r\ngoodwill and solidarity. \r\n In the Gambia, we cherish and are proud of the \r\nfact that, through the legacy of our forefathers, we \r\nenjoy religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence \r\nbetween the minority Christian and the majority \r\nMuslim populations. We celebrate each other’s feast \r\ndays and our religious leaders also exchange visits on \r\nthose days. Every year, at the beginning of the New \r\nYear, the President of the Republic invites religious \r\nleaders from all faiths and creeds to dialogue with him \r\nat the State House. Insh’allah, the Gambia will \r\ncontinue to strive to sustain its harmonious \r\nrelationships between Christians, Muslims and peoples \r\nof other faiths. \r\n Lastly, but by no means least, is the recognition \r\nof the power of education to bring about a change of \r\nmindset to one that embraces peace and dialogue, \r\nthrough the implementation of values education \r\nprogrammes in all schools across the globe. Those \r\ncourses should focus on the issues of freedom, \r\nprotection of the common good, honesty, integrity, \r\nrespect, understanding, tolerance and inclusion. That \r\nkind of education allows one to act according to one’s \r\nown thoughts. \r\n To conclude, my humble plea is to urge all of the \r\nnations of the world to act on the proposal of former \r\nPresident Khatami of Iran, namely, to seek to transform \r\ndialogue among civilizations from a doctrine into a \r\nprogramme of action. But above all, we should all \r\nstrive to internalize the profound words from the Bible: \r\nlove your neighbour as yourself. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of the \r\nRussian Federation. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We are very grateful to those who initiated \r\nthis meeting, first and foremost, King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, for the opportunity \r\nto discuss one of the most urgent issues of the world \r\ntoday — the role of religion in maintaining global and \r\nregional stability and in building an equitable and just \r\nworld.  \r\n In the era of globalization, cooperation between \r\ndifferent countries and peoples has become more \r\nintense and complicated than ever before. Various \r\nnon-governmental structures, including religious \r\ncommunities, have become increasingly involved in that \r\nprocess. The main religions have doctrines based on \r\nvalues that are common to humankind as a whole and \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 26 \r\n \r\nhave a considerable potential for peace; they are, \r\ntherefore, becoming more instrumental in preventing a \r\nclash between civilizations.  \r\n I believe those doctrines also play a decisive role, \r\nto a large extent, in our ability to counter extremism, \r\nracism and xenophobia and resolve nascent conflicts, \r\nas they are based on a common denominator of the \r\nvalues instilled by all of the great religions. Teaching \r\nmutual respect and tolerance through religious and \r\nsecular education programmes can contribute to such \r\nactions, in partnership with other sectors of society \r\nincluding the governmental sector.  \r\n On the other hand, it is essential to effectively use \r\nthe potential of the United Nations in strengthening \r\npeace between religions as a condition for achieving \r\nthe main goals of the Organization — global security, \r\ndevelopment and the promotion of human rights.  \r\n One of the essential goals is to overcome various \r\nforms of extremism. The growth in extremism \r\naggravates current problems as well as old ones \r\ninherited from the colonial era, including the economic \r\ndivide between the North and the South, grave \r\nviolations of human rights, including some committed \r\nin the context of the fight against terrorism, certain \r\nactivities by multinational corporations, as well as \r\nreligious defamation. The negative consequences of \r\nglobalization also place the national and cultural \r\nidentities of nations and traditional ethical principles in \r\njeopardy. \r\n The High-Level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace, \r\nwhich took place at the sixty-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, showed how important it is to \r\nmaintain cooperation between States, religions and \r\ncivil society. That positive experience should be \r\ndeveloped using the United Nations platform. In that \r\nconnection we attach great importance to an event \r\nplanned for 2010, namely, the International Year for the \r\nRapprochement of Cultures, and support involving \r\nreligious leaders in its various events. \r\n Russia views with great interest the issue of \r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue. We are a multi-\r\nconfessional country and we have never had religious \r\nwars. Russia therefore has a unique experience, \r\nstretching back a thousand years, of peaceful and \r\nfruitful cooperation between different religions. \r\n Russia takes an active part in a number of \r\nmultilateral processes to strengthen intercultural \r\ncooperation, including in the framework of the \r\nTripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace \r\nand the Alliance of Civilizations. We also have \r\nobserver status in the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. We also strive to make our own \r\ncontribution. There is a long list of Russian \r\ninternational initiatives, which include the World \r\nSummit of Religious Leaders, the World Public Forum \r\nDialogue of Civilizations, the Strategic Vision Group \r\nmeeting on Russia and the Islamic world and the \r\nInterreligious Council of the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States. \r\n The Russian religious community has been \r\ncooperating with the United Nations through useful \r\ncontacts that took place in the course of visits to Russia \r\nby the United Nations Secretary-General and the \r\nDirector General of the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization and by taking part \r\nin the activities of the Committee of Religious \r\nnon-governmental organizations at the United Nations. \r\n In the context of globalization, the role of the \r\nreligious factor in global politics makes it necessary to \r\nsuit approaches to current global problems based on \r\nthe common values of the main religions. The Russian \r\nFederation has suggested establishing a consultative \r\ncouncil of religions under the auspices of the United \r\nNations. That council could be a forum for an \r\nexchange of views between the representatives of \r\ndifferent faiths on how to overcome modern \r\nchallenges, cope with threats and achieve the goals of \r\nthe Organization. We think that the establishment of \r\nsuch a council would make it possible to promote \r\npeaceful cooperation between different religions and \r\nwould contribute to democratizing international \r\nrelations. \r\n That idea was a follow-up to the \r\nrecommendations of the World Summit of Religious \r\nLeaders, held in Moscow in 2006. There was a \r\nconsensus on the need to have a more systematic \r\npartnership of religious leaders and with the United \r\nNations. \r\n Yesterday, on 12 November, representatives of \r\nthe major global religions again met in Moscow and, \r\nfollowing the decisions of the Summit, they prepared a \r\npackage of practical proposals on strengthening \r\ncooperation between religious organizations, the \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n27 08-60077 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations and the United Nations Educational, \r\nCultural and Scientific Organization. \r\n Prior to that, between 27 and 29 October, another \r\nmeeting of the group, Russia and the Islamic world, \r\ntook place in Saudi Arabia. In the course of this \r\nmeeting, support was expressed for the initiative of \r\nestablishing a consultative council. \r\n In order to achieve a stable world, we need \r\nmutual understanding, respect for diversity of cultures, \r\ntraditions and the religious traditions of nations, as \r\nwell as collective, coordinated efforts and actions \r\ninvolving all stakeholders and participants of the \r\ninternational community. This type of constructive \r\napproach is based on the spirit of the United Nations. \r\nThe United Nations Charter calls for the demonstration \r\nof tolerance and living together in harmony. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): The \r\ndelegation of Senegal would like to thank the President \r\nfor having organized this meeting at the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly on the theme of the \r\nculture of peace through the dialogue among religions. \r\nThis is a subject of central importance for the whole of \r\nhumanity, which, today, is threatened by increasingly \r\nserious and underhanded threats.  \r\n On behalf of the head of State, His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdoulaye Wade, the Government and the people \r\nof Senegal, I would like to pay sincere tribute to the \r\ncustodian of the two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah \r\nBin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, who, by taking \r\nthe initiative to organize this meeting, has shown that \r\nwith responsible and enlightened leadership, one can \r\nmobilize people and Governments towards finding \r\nresponses to our common concerns. \r\n This tribute is also addressed to His Majesty Juan \r\nCarlos I, King of Spain. In addition to being a \r\nco-founder of the initiative of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, together with Turkey, his country hosted \r\nthe World Conference on Dialogue from 16 to 18 July \r\n2008. One of the recommendations resulting from that \r\nConference, quite appropriately, was to hold this high-\r\nlevel meeting in this temple of cooperation, \r\ncompromise, convergence and consensus. \r\n The choice of the Kingdom of Spain to host the \r\nWorld Conference on Dialogue was certainly not \r\ncoincidental. Given its geographical placement and its \r\nhistory, that great country is a land of encounter, a land \r\nof intermingling and intermarrying, and serves as \r\ncrossroads for peoples, nations, cultures and \r\ncivilizations, including the Greco-Roman, European, \r\nAfrican, Arab, Judeo-Christian and Islamic. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome all of the initiatives undertaken at national \r\nand international levels aimed at establishing bridges \r\nbetween peoples and nations. I would also like to \r\nreaffirm the unshakeable attachment of Senegal, as \r\nwell as our unfailing commitment, to constructively \r\ncontribute to the dialogue of civilizations, cultures and \r\nreligions. \r\n At a time when controversial declarations, words \r\nof violence and hate, as well as deliberately shocking \r\nacts, which nourish destructive passions, are \r\nproliferating it is more necessary than ever before to \r\nmove beyond a superficial commitment and establish a \r\ngenuine dialogue among peoples. \r\n This communion of minds and hearts will not be \r\npossible, however, if we do not set aside all \r\npreconceived ideas of superiority of one civilization \r\nover another. Concurrently, we also need to overcome \r\nour fear of the other and accept to compare our \r\nexperiences and move away from sectarian and \r\ncommunitarian approaches that isolate us in a pattern \r\nof exclusion and discrimination. \r\n We must also come to hold that no civilization \r\namong those that have survived the upheavals of \r\nhistory can boast that it has not been influenced by \r\nother peoples or cultures which have breathed their life \r\ninto it and have created a living dynamism that has \r\nbeen indispensable to its development. \r\n Quite clearly, civilizations have developed and \r\nbeen enriched by dialogue and by exchanges with \r\nothers, as is taught by the recent history of humanity, \r\nwhich has seen the emergence of great nations that \r\nhave been born of the meeting between communities \r\nand have crossed borders and overcome numerous \r\nobstacles to pull together the best that they have. \r\n Therefore, as was passionately advocated by our \r\nlate President and poet Léopold Sédar Senghor of \r\nSenegal, we must live our particularism to the limit to \r\nfind the dawn of the universal. In other words, it is by \r\nhaving a strong sense of our own values and by \r\nopening ourselves up to others that we will be able to \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 28 \r\n \r\nconstruct the civilization of the universal that will be a \r\nmeeting place of giving and receiving. Once again, I \r\nhave paraphrased here the call of Negritude and the \r\ncivilization of the universal. \r\n Today, there is unanimity on the necessity of a \r\ndialogue among cultures, civilizations and religions. \r\nHowever, we recognize that the modalities of this \r\ndialogue must be clearly defined for difficulties remain \r\non reconciling convictions and visions of the world, \r\nwhich are diverse and varied. At the same time, the \r\nboldness of the task should not be an insurmountable \r\nobstacle for us, because our destiny is so noble and our \r\nwill so firm that, by combining our efforts together, we \r\nwill surely succeed. \r\n In this respect, we must admit that dialogue \r\namong peoples cannot be based on the premise of a \r\nprevious agreement or the acceptance of a single \r\nbenchmark for civilization. On the contrary, its main \r\npremise must be mutual respect as the alternative to \r\nconfrontation and antagonism and must remove the \r\nobstacles born of misunderstandings and poorly \r\nfounded prejudices. \r\n In this context, the media also have a crucial role \r\nto play. It is up to them to pay greater attention to what \r\nunites us, rather than to what divides us, and avoid \r\nfalling into the trap of facile criticism. The media must \r\nattempt to reconcile the generally accepted demand of \r\nfreedom of expression with the duty to respect beliefs \r\nand the religions of others. \r\n Our attachment to freedom of expression must \r\nnever be interpreted as accepting a presumed right to \r\ndefamation of religions and the propagation of hate \r\namong communities. Freedom of expression must have \r\nresponsibility as its corollary. \r\n Dialogue among civilizations, cultures and \r\nreligions must be supported by a vigorous affirmation \r\nof our attachment to humanist values, such as equality, \r\nfairness and justice, in order to establish a climate of \r\ntrust among peoples on the basis of a knowledge of one \r\nanother and an enriching exchange of experience at all \r\nlevels. Such an endeavour can succeed only with the \r\nactive participation of all sectors of society, \r\nparticularly young people, who truly are the breeding \r\nground for new ideas that will lay the groundwork for a \r\nnew approach to the problems besetting us.  \r\n Educating young people about tolerance will \r\nenable us not only to dispel the darkness of ignorance, \r\nbut also, and in particular, to check the ambitions of \r\nthose who, in the name of so-called religious \r\nconviction, scorn the sacredness of human life. That is \r\nwhy my delegation is calling for the integration of \r\ncurriculums based on the dialogue among civilizations \r\nand the culture of peace into the educational \r\nprogrammes of all countries to help young people \r\nbetter accept differences and respect those with \r\nconvictions other than their own.  \r\n I wish to conclude by reaffirming the support of \r\nSenegal and its President, His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdoulaye Wade, current Chairman of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, for the Madrid \r\nprocess and the appeal launched by King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia for the \r\nestablishment of a steering committee and a special \r\nfund to ensure its autonomy and permanence.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 3369 \r\n(XXX) of 10 October 1975, I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. \r\n Mr. Ihsanoglu (Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference): It is a distinct honour for me to \r\nparticipate in this high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly proposed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I \r\nwould like to thank His Excellency Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, President of the General \r\nAssembly, for convening this important meeting under \r\nthe agenda item “Culture of peace”. \r\n I would like at the outset to thank His Majesty the \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah \r\nBin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, for this very \r\nimportant initiative to discuss a matter of great \r\nrelevance that portends potential challenges to world \r\npeace and security if left unaddressed.  \r\n Over the past two decades, the focus of world \r\npolitics has shifted from political and ideological \r\nconflicts between the world’s super-Powers to the \r\nso-called clash of cultures and religions. It is in this \r\natmosphere of disquieting uncertainty that we \r\nwholeheartedly welcome the timely and wise Saudi \r\ninitiative, which we regard as an affluent tributary to \r\nthe global efforts currently being made to restore \r\npeace, harmony and congeniality. By the same token, \r\nwe endorse this initiative and its related mechanism, \r\nwhich, we believe, will immediately meet with the \r\nacceptance of all those who are keen to champion the \r\n A/63/PV.48\r\n \r\n29 08-60077 \r\n \r\nprevalence of peaceful coexistence and cordial \r\nrelations among the adherents of all religions of the \r\nworld. \r\n The primary objective of this initiative is not to \r\npreach theological unity, but rather to exchange \r\nknowledge and raise awareness about the shared \r\nattributes of all religions and to correct misconceptions \r\nin a quest to bring about peace, security and stability \r\nthroughout the world. It also calls for a focus on the \r\ncommonalities among faiths and the promotion of \r\nglobal ethics. Its aim is not to make religions similar or \r\nidentical, but to acknowledge differences as serving the \r\nneeds of peoples of differing beliefs.  \r\n This initiative exhorts the international \r\ncommunity to focus on the common denominators of \r\nreligions, namely, deep faith in God, lofty principles \r\nand moral and noble values. It seeks to vanquish hatred \r\nthrough love, bigotry through tolerance and vice and \r\nevil through virtue.  \r\n The Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\n(OIC), in its quest to safeguard the spirit of dialogue \r\namong cultures, proposed the initiative of a dialogue \r\namong civilizations in 1998 as a response to the theory \r\nof the clash of civilizations. The idea was endorsed by \r\nthe General Assembly, which set it in motion in 2001, \r\nresulting in a profound impact on global peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n To date, the failure of the dialogue can be \r\nattributed to a lack of political will on the part of \r\nstakeholders. We have had many meetings and \r\ndeclarations, without any real implementation of our \r\ndecisions. Likewise, we have not succeeded in \r\nreaching out to the grassroots of society in order to \r\nconvey to them a message of tolerance, compassion \r\nand peaceful coexistence. \r\n The well-known theory of the clash of \r\ncivilizations and its self-fulfilling prophecy seem to \r\nhave been legitimized. The powerful tools of the media \r\nhave been mobilized to create a conceptual link \r\nbetween Islam and terror. Phrases such as “Muslim \r\nterrorists” and “Muslim terror” have become \r\ncommonplace. Such portrayals, frequently propagated \r\nby the media, and misperceptions about Islam and \r\nMuslims have become the most persistent and virulent \r\nsources of the phenomenon of Islamophobia, resulting \r\nin prejudicial practices and incitement against Muslims \r\nwithout any distinction. As a result, Islam, which is an \r\nAbrahamic religion whose name means “peace”, is \r\nfrequently associated with violence. That state of \r\naffairs does not bode well for concord and stability in \r\ninternational relations. It requires that immediate and \r\nconcrete measures be taken in earnest to stem those \r\nunfounded claims and tendencies. \r\n At this juncture, I would like to stress that \r\ntolerance was and still is the benchmark of Islam. \r\nTolerance is born of the very nature of that global faith. \r\nIslam is not an exclusive or novel religion, but a part of \r\nthe entire history of humankind. It continues and \r\nconfirms previous scriptures. It has been tested through \r\n1,400 years and has proved to be a religion of peace, \r\npluralism and acknowledgement of the other. \r\n We in the OIC believe that all religions have \r\ncommon core values and objectives. Over the past four \r\ndecades, the OIC, with its 57 member countries, has \r\nworked to disseminate the imperative of the notion of \r\ndialogue among various cultures and civilizations. On \r\nthe basis of that premise, we believe that this initiative \r\nis more important than all previous initiatives of its \r\nkind.  \r\n The OIC and its specialized agencies are working \r\nrelentlessly to disseminate tolerance, mercy, \r\ncompassion and concord among Muslim populations \r\nthroughout the world. In so doing, we are drawing on \r\nthe ethical and moral resources embedded in the \r\nprovisions of the OIC Charter and the OIC 10-year \r\nProgramme of Action, which was endorsed by the third \r\nextraordinary session of the Islamic Summit \r\nConference held under the initiative of His Majesty \r\nKing Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia \r\nin 2005. The Programme calls on member States to \r\nspread correct ideas about Islam as a religion of \r\nmoderation and tolerance. It also condemns extremism \r\nin all its forms and manifestations, while emphasizing \r\nintercivilizational dialogue and interreligious dialogue. \r\nIt also underlines the common values and denominators \r\nof religions. \r\n As the sole official intergovernmental \r\norganization representing the Muslim world, the OIC \r\nfirmly believes that the diversity of cultures and \r\nreligions is an acknowledged and essential part of the \r\nworld in which we live. That fact should be considered \r\na valuable foundation on which to build a more just \r\nand harmonious world.  \r\n We believe that it is incumbent upon us of all to \r\ndo our utmost to educate ordinary people to conceive \r\nof culture and civilization as a universal human \r\nA/63/PV.48  \r\n \r\n08-60077 30 \r\n \r\nheritage to which all people have contributed and \r\nwhich all people should endeavour to share and \r\nstrengthen. That concept is most relevant to our time, \r\nand its relevance is a condition for a worthwhile \r\n \r\ninterfaith dialogue and interrelationship leading to \r\ngreater understanding, concord and harmony among all \r\nnations and ushering in an era of durable peace. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.  \r\n"
