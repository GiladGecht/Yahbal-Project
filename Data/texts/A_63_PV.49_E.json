All over the world, people of different religions \r\nnow live and work together in mixed societies. \r\nDiversity is a byword both religious and cultural, \r\nwhich in turn raises important questions about how \r\nreligions and cultures can and should interact. We \r\nshould consider ways to facilitate dialogue because the \r\nmap of the world should never be colour-coded based \r\non our different religious identities. \r\n In this regard, interreligious dialogue has become \r\nan important way for people of different religions to \r\nengage with one another and to build mutual trust and \r\nunderstanding. The roots of such dialogue can be \r\ntraced back to the late nineteenth century, when the \r\nWorld’s Parliament of Religions was held in the United \r\nStates. The interreligious movement has gathered \r\nmomentum since then and has become increasingly \r\nimportant and relevant in recent years. \r\n Religion is a highly personal and spiritual matter. \r\nIt can evoke the deepest responses and convictions of a \r\nperson, to the extent that perceived differences \r\nsometimes become too difficult to bridge. Therefore, it \r\nis understandable that some peoples and communities \r\nmay not be comfortable with the idea of interreligious \r\ndialogue and interaction. Although different religions \r\nmay preach similar moral standards and values, \r\ndifferences between religions can be very real and \r\ndistinct. However, in today’s world, where our lives are \r\nso deeply intertwined, we cannot afford to be ignorant \r\nof one another or to have enmities between different \r\nreligions and cultures. As we get to know one another \r\nbetter, we not only appreciate how others in different \r\nreligious communities encounter the divine, but also \r\nenhance our understanding of our own religions. In the \r\nprocess, we hope to widen the common ground that we \r\nall share in the development of all societies. \r\n Dialogue is clearly important, as it seeks to \r\nengage individuals, build relationships and deepen \r\nmutual trust and understanding. However, to be \r\neffective in the promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural sentiments, dialogue will have to be \r\naccompanied by action. Governments have an \r\nimportant role to play in this regard. Governments can \r\nand should initiate processes at the local level to bring \r\ntogether key partners capable of establishing links \r\nbetween religious leaders, so as to emphasize the value \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 2 \r\n \r\nof working together in harmony for mutual benefit. To \r\ndo this sensitively and meaningfully, we need to \r\nrecognize the local realities of society, such as the trust \r\nthat people have in their Governments to be impartial \r\nin their dealings with different ethnic communities. \r\n Singapore is a small island State with a \r\npopulation of approximately 4.84 million. Ethnic \r\nChinese make up approximately 75 per cent of the \r\npopulation, Malays make up about 14 per cent and \r\nIndians 9 per cent. The rest of the population consists \r\nof Eurasians and other ethnic groups.  \r\n Singapore is also a multireligious country. While \r\nabout 15 per cent of the population has no religious \r\naffiliation, the majority of Singaporeans are followers \r\nof various faiths, including Christianity, Buddhism, \r\nIslam, Hinduism, Sikhism and the Baha’i faith, among \r\nothers.  \r\n Notwithstanding our diversity, race and religious \r\nrelations in Singapore today are generally stable and \r\nstrong, with a good level of interreligious tolerance and \r\nrespect. This is no mean feat and is the result of the \r\nconcerted efforts of the Singapore Government and its \r\npeople over almost three decades. For example, in 1990, \r\nSingapore’s Parliament passed the Maintenance of \r\nReligious Harmony Act, allowing the Government to \r\nrestrain leaders and members of religious groups or \r\ninstitutions from carrying out any act that could cause \r\nfeelings of enmity, hatred, ill will or hostility among \r\ndifferent religious groups. A Presidential Council on \r\nReligious Harmony was also formed under the Act to \r\nadvise the Government on matters affecting the \r\nmaintenance of religious harmony in Singapore. In \r\n2003, the Declaration of Religious Harmony was issued \r\nby the national bodies of all mainstream religious groups \r\nin Singapore to affirm the importance of and \r\ncommitment to religious harmony. The Inter-Religious \r\nHarmony Circle comprising religious representatives \r\nwas subsequently formed to further enhance our efforts \r\nin the promotion of interreligious harmony. \r\n More recently, in 2006, an overarching \r\ngovernmental effort to foster unity and resilience \r\namong various communities and religious groups was \r\nestablished. Called the Community Engagement \r\nProgramme, it brought together stakeholders from \r\ncommunity organizations, businesses, unions, media, \r\neducational institutions and religious organizations to \r\ntake up the responsibility of building social resilience \r\nand communal harmony. A major achievement on this \r\nfront was the establishment of the National Steering \r\nCommittee on Racial and Religious Harmony, which \r\nbrings together apex leaders of all major faith and \r\nethnic organizations to dialogue and exchange views.  \r\n We are also seeing more ground-up initiatives in \r\nthe promotion of interreligious dialogue in \r\nSingaporean society. One example is a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding signed by the Young Men’s Christian \r\nAssociation and the Singapore Malay Youth Library \r\nAssociation in April 2006 to enhance interaction and \r\nunderstanding between Christian youths and their \r\nMalay peers. \r\n Efforts to promote dialogue are only one side of \r\nthe coin. Singapore’s approach to communal harmony \r\nalso comprises legislative measures against those who \r\nstir up and provoke racial or religious intolerance. In \r\nthis regard, the Singapore Government amended the \r\npenal code in 2007 to criminalize acts that promote \r\nenmity between different religions or racial groups and \r\nare prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony in \r\nsociety. The Singapore Government has also shown \r\nthat it will not hesitate to mete out what some might \r\nconsider harsh punishments to individuals or groups \r\nwho commit acts that promote feelings of ill will and \r\nhostility between different races and religions. In 2005, \r\nthree bloggers were sentenced under the Sedition Act \r\nfor posting inflammatory racist comments about \r\nMalays and Muslims on their blogs. The conviction \r\nwas necessary in order to send a strong message to all \r\nSingaporeans that acts that promote feelings of ill will \r\nand hostility among different races and religious \r\ncommunities cannot be allowed and that all offenders \r\nwill be dealt with accordingly. \r\n Singapore, of all countries, knows that peace and \r\ncommunal harmony are hard won. The lessons of the \r\nracial riots of the 1960s remain an indelible part of our \r\nhistory, just as the willingness of our people to \r\nembrace the diversity of ethnicities and religions \r\ncontinues to be passed on from generation to \r\ngeneration. This mutual understanding is something \r\nthat we have come to accept and treasure in Singapore, \r\nin order to keep our small multicultural society \r\ncohesive and harmonious. \r\n We have also learned that preserving trust and \r\nunderstanding among different religious communities \r\nrequires a spirit of give and take. In respecting others, \r\nevery religious group will be protected and assured of \r\nfair treatment in all aspects of life. This is an approach \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n3 08-60083 \r\n \r\nwhich is pragmatic and responsible and has worked for \r\nSingapore, as it allows every section of society to work \r\ntogether as partners for a common cause and to build \r\nan equal and harmonious society. \r\n In this regard, my delegation is pleased to support \r\nthe efforts spearheaded by the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia to bring about this plenary discussion on a \r\nculture of peace. This initiative reaffirms the \r\nimportance of promoting interreligious dialogue as the \r\nway towards peaceful coexistence among nations and \r\npeoples. My delegation also notes that the General \r\nAssembly has declared 2010 as the International Year \r\nfor the Rapprochement of Cultures, and we pledge our \r\nsupport for the events that will be held in the course of \r\nthe Year to further enhance efforts in that context. \r\n Engaging in interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue has never been more pertinent than in today’s \r\nincreasingly globalized world. Open and sustained \r\ndialogue, as well as respect for the freedom of \r\nexpression and of religious belief, are fundamental to \r\nour endeavour to promote a culture of peace. We have \r\nseen the emergence of various initiatives and \r\nmechanisms within the United Nations towards this \r\nend. The task at hand is to ensure the synergy of these \r\nefforts so that we can all stand on common ground in \r\npromoting the development of human society and \r\nbuilding a harmonious world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of San \r\nMarino. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening this \r\nmeeting, the Secretary-General for preparing the report \r\non interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace, and His \r\nMajesty King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud for his \r\ninitiative to request this high-level meeting here in the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Republic of San Marino has been able to \r\npreserve its independence and its citizens’ freedom \r\nthroughout the past 17 centuries only with the strength \r\nof peaceful tolerance: tolerance with our neighbours \r\nand tolerance among our own people. Tolerance is at \r\nthe core of all religions. We embrace the statement \r\nmade yesterday by His Majesty the King of Saudi \r\nArabia:  \r\n “Terrorism and crime are the enemies of ... every \r\nreligion and every civilization. They would not \r\nhave appeared except for the absence of the \r\nprinciple of tolerance” (A/63/PV.46). \r\n During the last year of the Second World War, \r\nwhen powerful armies were devastating our \r\nneighbours’ countryside and cities and decimating their \r\ncivilian population, San Marino was able to shelter and \r\nfeed more than 100,000 refugees — a number five \r\ntimes larger than our population in those days — \r\nwithout distinction as to their political and religious \r\nbeliefs. \r\n The Republic of San Marino is very conscious of \r\nthe importance of intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue. Our Government, during its chairmanship of \r\nthe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, \r\nwas at the forefront of debate on this topic. That debate \r\ngenerated a conference on the religious dimension of \r\nintercultural dialogue in Europe. The conference was \r\nattended by the Council member States, leaders \r\nbelonging to the three major monotheistic religions and \r\nexperts from civil society. \r\n We are very pleased that this very important \r\nmeeting is taking place here in the General Assembly \r\nHall. More than ever, our General Assembly must be \r\nthe engine room for generating bold new ideas in order \r\nto enable all of us to respond to old and new challenges \r\nof our world, such as climate change, financial \r\nmeltdown, economic depression, poverty, development, \r\nendemic disease and terrorism. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nAzerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, allow \r\nme to express my Government’s gratitude and sincere \r\nthanks to His Majesty King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al \r\nSaud of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the initiative \r\nto request this high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the culture of peace. This meeting indeed \r\noffers a timely opportunity to exchange views and \r\nideas on the promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, tolerance, mutual understanding \r\nand cooperation. \r\n Located at the geographic crossroads of the West \r\nand East, Azerbaijan has embraced various elements of \r\nboth cultures and civilizations. Indeed, in my country, \r\nwhere various faiths and religious trends have been \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 4 \r\n \r\npropagated throughout our history, relations of \r\ntolerance were established and prevailed among \r\ndifferent communities. \r\n From the second half of the nineteenth century, \r\nthe capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, became the petroleum \r\ncentre of the region and beyond, while the country \r\namassed a mixture of languages, religions and cultural \r\ntraditions. In 1918, Azerbaijan established the first-\r\never democratic republic in the East, with a multiparty \r\nparliament and a coalition Government. During the \r\nyears of communist rule in Azerbaijan, which \r\nmercilessly fought against religion, remarkable \r\nreligious centres were destroyed and spiritual values \r\nand traditions were subjected to systematic desecration \r\nand oppression. Ever since Azerbaijan restored its \r\nindependence, equality before the law and the right to \r\nfreedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief \r\nwere effectively guaranteed by the State and many \r\nmosques, churches and synagogues were constructed \r\nand rehabilitated in the country. \r\n Nowadays, Azerbaijan shares European values \r\nand is an inalienable component of the Euro-Atlantic \r\nsecurity architecture. At the same time, Azerbaijan, as \r\npart of the Muslim world, shares the progressive \r\nheritage and spiritual values of Islamic culture and \r\ncivilization. Such an advantage gives us an ample \r\nopportunity to contribute to the promotion of \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue and \r\nunderstanding, encourage ethnic and religious diversity \r\nand develop intercommunal links. \r\n Against this background, Azerbaijan has \r\nrepeatedly expressed its determination to act as a \r\nnatural bridge consolidating different continents, \r\ncultures and civilizations and establishing the \r\nnecessary prerequisites for the promotion of \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue. \r\n Thus, being convinced of the crucial role that \r\nmedia plays in shaping public opinion, in April 2007, \r\nAzerbaijan hosted an international conference on the \r\nrole of media in the development of tolerance and \r\nmutual understanding. As an active member of the \r\ngroup of friends of the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nAzerbaijan convened in November 2007, with the \r\nsupport of UNDP, the Council of Europe and the \r\nIslamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization, a high-level conference in the context of \r\nthe Youth for Alliance of Civilizations initiative. \r\nAnother important international gathering took place in \r\nmy country this June and was dedicated to the role of \r\nwomen in cross-cultural dialogue. \r\n We look forward to continuing to contribute to \r\npeace and mutual understanding through the promotion \r\nof a dialogue among civilizations and cultures, \r\nincluding by holding high-profile, action-oriented \r\nevents that would bring together political leaders, \r\nGovernments, international organizations, civil society \r\ngroups, religious communities and the media. \r\n Thus, Azerbaijan will host next month the Council \r\nof Europe conference of ministers of culture on \r\nintercultural dialogue as a basis for peace and \r\nsustainable development in Europe and its neighbouring \r\nregions. Furthermore, Baku is being prepared to become \r\nthe capital of Islamic culture for 2009. \r\n In recent years, unacceptable attacks against \r\nIslam in some countries have confirmed the vital \r\nnecessity of joint efforts and dialogue to counter such \r\ndefamatory manifestations and misconceptions. \r\n We fully support the recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General on the importance of increasing \r\neducational efforts to remove hate messages, \r\ndistortions, prejudice and negative bias from textbooks \r\nand other educational media, and of ensuring the basic \r\nknowledge and understanding of the world’s main \r\ncultures, civilizations and religions. \r\n Against the background of Azerbaijan’s \r\nprincipled approach to safeguarding its unity, diversity, \r\ncultural heritage and spiritual values, there has been \r\nanother situation in our immediate neighbourhood \r\nbased upon the regrettable policy of ethnic and \r\nreligious incompatibility. Thus, the practical realization \r\nof this policy resulted in destructive aggression against \r\nAzerbaijan and occupation and ethnic cleansing of its \r\nterritories. As a consequence, Azerbaijan has suffered, \r\ninter alia, from excessive cultural destruction. \r\nNumerous historical, cultural, religious monuments \r\nand works of art have been destroyed and plundered in \r\nthe occupied territories of my country. Therefore, the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s consideration of the agenda item \r\nentitled “The situation in the occupied territories of \r\nAzerbaijan” plays an important role in attracting the \r\nattention of Member States to the illegal practices in \r\nthe occupied territories and initiating urgent measures \r\nto put an end to them. \r\n In conclusion, I express the hope that this \r\nmeeting will make a valuable contribution to \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n5 08-60083 \r\n \r\novercoming stereotypes and misconceptions, to \r\ndiminishing hostility and to promoting dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and mutual respect among people of \r\ndifferent cultural and religious traditions. I am \r\nconfident that the tangible results of this meeting will \r\nbe a source of inspiration for all of us in our efforts to \r\nfind creative solutions to the problems we are facing. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nMauritania. \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nArabic): On behalf of the Islamic Republic of \r\nMauritania, allow me to express our deep thanks and \r\ngratitude to the President of the Assembly for convening \r\nthis all-important meeting. We also wish to express our \r\nappreciation to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, \r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, for \r\nthis valuable initiative, which reflects his sincere \r\ncommitment to promoting the culture of peace and the \r\nefforts that he has been deploying to promote cultural \r\nunderstanding among the peoples of the world. His most \r\nrecent initiative was the convening, together with King \r\nJuan Carlos I of Spain, of the Madrid Interfaith Dialogue \r\nConference, in July 2008. \r\n This high-level debate of the General Assembly \r\nacquires special significance in our world, as it comes \r\namid theories of the inevitability of the clash of \r\ncivilizations and cultures and ideas that seek to deepen \r\nthe differences among nations and to erode the \r\nfoundations of peace and coexistence among peoples. \r\n Muslim countries attach special importance to \r\nthis meeting as an opportunity to project, in this \r\nuniversal forum, the true and noble message of Islam, \r\nwhich is the message of tolerance. Indeed our Prophet \r\nsays, in our holy tradition, “I was sent with a tolerant \r\nfaith” and “Allah loves the tolerant faith of truth”. It is \r\na universal message that is addressed to mankind and \r\nnot to a single race, ethnic group or nation. In the Holy \r\nKoran, Allah Almighty says “We have sent you to all \r\nmankind, to convey to them glad tidings and to warn \r\nthem of what will come” and “We have only sent you \r\nas mercy to the world”. Islam honours mankind as \r\nhuman beings and does not discriminate on the basis of \r\ncolour, sex or ethnicity: “We have honoured the \r\nchildren of Adam”. The Messenger of God stood to let \r\na funeral procession go by. Someone said to him “The \r\ndead one is not a Muslim”. The Messenger of God \r\nreplied “Is he not a human being?” \r\n This is the nature of Islam, a culture that is open \r\nto all cultures and civilizations. It interacts with them. \r\nIslam rejects cultural hegemony and respects the right \r\nof other religious minorities within its domain to freely \r\npractise their rites. It is an open culture, willing to \r\ninteract with other cultures and civilizations on the \r\nbasis of clear principles, including the following.  \r\n First, there must be mutual respect between all \r\nreligions without any denigration of the beliefs of \r\nothers or defamation of their symbols. The Koran says \r\n“Do not insult those who do not invoke the message of \r\nGod so that they will not insult God”. We are told to \r\nrefrain from aggression against others: “Allah does not \r\nforbid you from befriending those who did not attack \r\nyou or expel you from your homes”. We must \r\nconsolidate that which unites peoples and religions: “O \r\npeople of the scriptures, come to a world that is just \r\nbetween us and you”. We are told to observe the rules \r\nof dialogue and respect for others: “Allah does not like \r\nthe public mention of evil except by those who have \r\nbeen wronged”. Moreover, we are told to “argue with \r\npeople of scriptures in decency and with respect”. The \r\nKoran tells us to “deal justly with all, even if they \r\ndisagree with us”, exhorting us “when you judge \r\nbetween men, judge with justice, and if people aggress \r\nagainst you, remain just because justice is close to \r\npiety”.  \r\n Islam recognizes the heritage of humanity and its \r\nprogress by establishing and consolidating noble \r\nvalues and high morals. As the Radith says, “I was sent \r\nto uphold and complement ethical values”. Thus, \r\nMuslims believe and revere all prophets and \r\nmessengers of God who came before them. The Holy \r\nKoran says that “the Messenger has believed in what \r\nwas revealed to him from his Lord, and so have the \r\nbelievers; all believed in Allah and His Angels and His \r\nBooks and His Messengers, saying, we make no \r\ndistinction between any of his Messengers”. \r\n If dialogue is conducted on these bases, it could \r\nlead to deepening the understanding among peoples \r\nand promoting human values, consolidating social \r\npeace and security, and opening the door to combating \r\ninjustice and aggression, and laying down the \r\nprinciples of truth, justice, respect for human dignity \r\nand for all aspects of our environment, including flora \r\nand fauna. \r\n The dialogue among cultures and its contributions \r\nto international peace is hampered by several factors, \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 6 \r\n \r\nincluding unequal opportunities, disparate standards of \r\nliving, the feeling among many peoples and cultures \r\nthat they are marginalized or are victims of exclusion \r\nand double standards, unjust policies, the negative \r\nattitudes of others towards issues of importance to \r\nthem, preconceived stereotypes and dangerous \r\ngeneralizations based on a few isolated incidents that \r\nrepresent deliberate attempts to obscure the truth while \r\npromoting falsehood. \r\n Muslims have received their share of such \r\nattitudes and the image of their religion and culture has \r\nsuffered as a result of such distortions. It is thus time to \r\nredress these wrongs and to give them justice. It is time \r\nto listen to them, to address their grievances and solve \r\ntheir problems, so that they may contribute to the \r\nrealization of world peace that they deserve and so that \r\nthey may actively participate in the dialogue of \r\ncultures.  \r\n Taking the declaration made at the World \r\nConference on Dialogue held in Madrid and its \r\nrecommendations as a solid basis for various cultures \r\nand civilizations to agree on common strategies to \r\nserve humanity, we take special note of the following \r\nfacts: First, diversity of cultures and civilizations is a \r\nsign from God, and it should be a cause for the \r\nhumanity to progress. Secondly, dialogue is essential \r\nfor life, as it is important to know others, cooperate \r\nand communicate with them, in order to find the truth \r\nthat contributes to the happiness of mankind. Thirdly, \r\nwe must respect monotheistic religions, beliefs and \r\nsymbols and must condemn any attempts to denigrate \r\nor insult religious symbols or exploit religion to incite \r\nracial discrimination. Finally, all cultures and religions \r\ncall for peace, respect for others and the \r\nacknowledgment that they, too, have a right to peace \r\nand freedom. \r\n The international community must assume its \r\nresponsibilities in combating extremism and terrorism \r\nby addressing misguided ideological and political \r\nconcepts as well as the economic and social imbalances \r\nthat give rise to such phenomena. We should therefore \r\nadopt comprehensive integrated strategies based on an \r\neducational and cultural approach that renounces \r\nhatred, extremism and terrorism and encourages \r\ncoexistence and communication with other \r\ncivilizations. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which, \r\nthroughout its history, has abided by the principles and \r\nvalues of tolerance and was a link for fruitful contacts \r\nand exchanges between different cultures and \r\ncivilizations, stands ready today to continue that role \r\nand to support all efforts being deployed to lay down \r\nthe basis for a culture of peace, coexistence and \r\nstability. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nMalaysia. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): I wish to express our \r\nappreciation to the President and to the Custodian of \r\nthe Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King Abdullah \r\nbin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, for the effort \r\ntaken in elevating to a high-level event this plenary \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly to consider agenda \r\nitem 45, “Culture of peace”. This effort contributes to \r\nour common goal of building a culture of peace, \r\ntolerance and understanding, and builds upon previous \r\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations on this \r\nmatter. Malaysia is fully supportive of efforts at the \r\ninternational level that are designed to generate greater \r\nunderstanding between cultures and civilizations. \r\n Our world continues to be besieged with conflicts \r\namong nations and among peoples, despite our world’s \r\nprogress into modernity and democracy. Culture, \r\nethnicity and religion are abused by some to highlight \r\nthe differences among us, and to transform these \r\ndifferences into divisions, as opposed to celebrating \r\nthem as the beauty of the diversity among peoples. Yet \r\nthe conflicts that these differences have spawned in our \r\nworld today remain political in nature and reflect some \r\nof the socio-economic gaps in our globalized world. \r\n Malaysia believes that we need to be mindful of \r\nthe political dimensions vis-à-vis the divide among \r\nsocieties and nations, including, in particular, conflict \r\nsituations in different regions of the world and the need \r\nto reach final and just solutions. Although there \r\nremains disagreement in some quarters, it cannot be \r\nignored that intercultural divides are very much \r\ninfluenced by the global political scene. We need to \r\naddress these political root causes as increased access \r\nand exposure to images and information can be easily \r\nused either to perpetuate these divides or to help to \r\nclose them. \r\n Building a culture of peace is also aided through \r\nensuring that people are free from the socio-economic \r\nwants in life such as having access to food, shelter, \r\neducation and decent work, as well as stability and \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n7 08-60083 \r\n \r\ncontrol over their own future. In this respect, we need \r\nto ensure that the right to development is pursued and \r\nmade tangible, and that inequality gaps in income and \r\nopportunities among countries and within societies are \r\novercome. \r\n Societies in general tend to take self-centred \r\nviews of themselves, viewing other peoples and \r\ncultures from the perspective of their own benchmarks \r\nand philosophies while sometimes imposing their \r\nvalues on other societies, thereby creating an \r\natmosphere of acrimony and distrust among peoples. \r\nWe are now witnessing a dangerous trend in the form \r\nof a growing schism between different cultures and \r\nreligions which, if not addressed properly, could \r\npresent a serious threat to international peace. As a \r\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural and multireligious country, \r\nMalaysia understands very well the challenges the \r\nworld would be confronted with if this dangerous trend \r\nis not reversed. \r\n We are witnessing, inter alia, a growing rise in \r\nthe phenomenon of Islamophobia and its legitimization \r\nin political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and \r\nin society at large. This phenomenon is the result of \r\nresurgent activities by political parties and associations \r\nestablished on the basis of racist, xenophobic and \r\nperceived ideological superiority. The resulting \r\ndefamation of religions is a real phenomenon, and we \r\ndisagree with the notion that the defamation of religion \r\nis not an infringement of human rights. The defamation \r\nof religion constitutes a derogation of the right of \r\nbelief, as it is inextricably linked to incitement to racial \r\nand religious hatred. The defamation of religion and \r\nfreedom of opinion and expression are not mutually \r\nexclusive or incompatible. It is our view that the issue \r\nis not one or the other, but ensuring that respect for \r\nboth can be balanced in conceptual as well as legal and \r\npractical terms. This is one area on which the \r\ninternational community should focus, instead of \r\ndebating the righteousness of one as opposed to the \r\nother. \r\n Initiatives such as, inter alia, the holding of this \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting, the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and the Conference on Interfaith \r\nCooperation for Peace are important aspects of the \r\ninternational commitment to the promotion of \r\nintercultural, intercivilizational and interreligious \r\nunderstanding and cooperation. Malaysia supports such \r\ninitiatives and believes that the positive interaction \r\namong peoples of diverse cultures and values will help \r\nto achieve the aim of preserving and promoting global \r\npeace and stability, which are prerequisites for the \r\npromotion of sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n While we have been fostering high-level dialogue \r\nfor the past two days, we also need to focus our \r\nsubsequent work on ensuring that this interaction flows \r\nto the local and grass-roots levels. We need to translate \r\nour ideas and thoughts into practical measures. \r\nMember States, the United Nations system and civil \r\nsociety all have important and complementary roles in \r\nensuring that that can become a reality. Partnership \r\nwith civil society, including non-governmental \r\norganizations and the private sector, will greatly \r\nenhance our mutual efforts to promote intercultural, \r\nintercivilizational and interreligious understanding and \r\nrepresents the determined will of the international \r\ncommunity to cooperate for peace. \r\n Over the past few years, many other initiatives \r\nhave been undertaken to promote intercultural, \r\nintercivilizational and interreligious dialogue. These \r\ninclude efforts at the international, regional and \r\nnational levels — sometimes organized and convened \r\nby States, and sometimes by agencies within the United \r\nNations system or by civil society. Those efforts are \r\napplauded and welcomed. Malaysia feels that the \r\nUnited Nations is the international body best placed to \r\ncoordinate such efforts and that it can play a leading \r\nrole. \r\n As part of our intercultural, intercivilizational and \r\ninterreligious dialogue, all actors need to ensure that \r\nwe increase the number of bridge-builders and focus on \r\nthe values that we share. We need to approach dialogue \r\nwith mutual respect for all our dimensions, including \r\nethnicity, culture and religion, as well as for various \r\ncountries and nationalities. Once again, I wish to stress \r\nthat political viewpoints should not cloud our common \r\nvalues. \r\n We must always bear in mind that all belief \r\nsystems, in essence, extol the virtues of tolerance and \r\npeace; that each and every society must develop a \r\ndemocratic system that suits it, while retaining its \r\nessential principles; that labelling creates confusion \r\nrather than clarity and in some cases can be considered \r\nan insult; and that long-lasting issues that continue to \r\nplague humanity can act as a rallying cause for \r\nextremism and must be resolved in a fair, just and \r\nbalanced manner. \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 8 \r\n \r\n Malaysia remains convinced that the culture of \r\npeace lies in mutual understanding, respect and \r\ntolerance among religions, cultures and peoples. We, as \r\nmembers of this body, must work hand in hand to \r\nachieve that goal with a view to the peace and \r\nprosperity of our world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the representative of Ethiopia. \r\n Mr. Alemu (Ethiopia): First of all, my delegation \r\nwishes to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly on the convening and the fruitful conduct of \r\nthis high-level meeting on the culture of peace, which, \r\nas many previous speakers have said, is more \r\nimportant than ever in today’s troubled world. My \r\ndelegation would also like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation to His Majesty King Abdullah bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, Custodian of the \r\nTwo Holy Mosques, for having personally taken the \r\ninitiative to make it possible to convene this high-level \r\ndialogue on interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace at a very \r\ncritical time, when mankind urgently needs to achieve \r\nbetter understanding and greater tolerance. \r\n I also wish to express our profound appreciation \r\nand satisfaction regarding the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/63/262) on the agenda item under \r\nconsideration. Indeed, the report presents a broad \r\noverview of the various major activities carried out \r\npursuant to resolution 62/90 over the past year. I shall \r\nbriefly reflect on some of them in the light of the great \r\nsignificance attached to this agenda item by the \r\nGovernment of Ethiopia from the perspective of its \r\nown national policy.  \r\n It is gratifying to note that, as well described in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General, quite a number of \r\nencouraging activities have been carried out by \r\nUNESCO, the Alliance of Civilizations, the United \r\nNations Population Fund, the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the \r\nDepartment of Public Information and the Department \r\nof Economic and Social Affairs, all of which play \r\ndirect roles in implementing the agenda under review, \r\nwith various focuses and mandates. Thus, the important \r\nactivities carried out by those major actors in \r\nfacilitating and promoting intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogue and in developing concrete \r\nworking relationships with cultural and faith-based \r\norganizations that play useful roles and make \r\ncontributions in that area are truly promising. They \r\ninspire member countries to become further engaged in \r\nnurturing and enriching this crucial agenda with greater \r\ncommitment and a shared vision. \r\n That would undoubtedly provide additional \r\nimpetus and strength to the burgeoning achievements \r\nthat have been made so far and the many promising \r\nactivities that are still in the pipeline or at an initial \r\nstage, not to mention the promise that it would hold for \r\nfuture activities. In that regard, it may suffice to \r\nconsider what has been accomplished within the \r\nrelatively short period of time since the establishment \r\nof the Alliance of Civilizations in 2005 under United \r\nNations auspices, following the commendable \r\ninitiatives taken by the Governments of Spain and \r\nTurkey. \r\n It is indeed gratifying to learn that the Alliance — \r\nwhich has the lofty aim of improving understanding \r\nand cooperative relationships among States and \r\npeoples across cultures and religions, coupled with the \r\nimperative of helping to counter the forces that fuel \r\npolarization and extremism — has made some good \r\nprogress, which quite rightly began with the \r\nengagement of eminent personalities from around the \r\nglobe. We recognize that the appointment of a United \r\nNations High Commissioner to direct the enormous \r\ntask and the development of a detailed and action-\r\noriented implementation plan in various appropriate \r\nfields were steps taken in the right direction to fulfil \r\nthe initiative’s paramount objectives. \r\n The fast increase in the expansion of political \r\nsupport around the Alliance through the Group of \r\nFriends mechanism, whose membership of countries \r\nand multilateral groups has doubled from 44 last year \r\nto 88 this year, is in itself an example par excellence of \r\nthe positive progress made in that regard. \r\n Likewise, the successful convening of the first \r\nForum of the Alliance of Civilizations, in January 2008 \r\nin Madrid, hosted by the Government of Spain, was \r\ntruly a remarkable step in the right direction. My \r\ncountry, Ethiopia — one of the very few cradles of \r\nhuman civilization — was honoured to take part in that \r\ngrand Forum, with two-pronged high-level \r\nrepresentation, by the Government and the Ethiopian \r\nOrthodox Church. We enthusiastically support the \r\noutcome of that historic Forum and look forward to the \r\nupcoming Second Forum of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, which the Government of Turkey has \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n9 08-60083 \r\n \r\nwillingly promised to host in April 2009, and which is \r\nexpected to attract even wider worldwide participation \r\nthan its predecessor as a high-profile event. \r\n Ethiopia, whose strengths as a nation lie in the \r\ndiversity of its peoples, is home to more than \r\n80 different ethno-linguistic groups and as such has \r\nrightly been described as a mosaic of cultures, beyond \r\nbeing the very cradle of mankind itself. Ethiopia is also \r\nknown as an ancient common home of the three \r\nAbrahamic religions; Judaism, Christianity and Islam, \r\nwhose followers have lived together in harmony and \r\ntolerance for millennia, making the country an \r\noutstanding example of religious tolerance and, indeed, \r\ncohesion through its unique, age-old blessing of unity \r\nin diversity. It is a land where peoples of many \r\nreligions and creeds live and work together and \r\nunderstand and help one another in ideal harmony. \r\nIndeed, it would not be an overstatement to say that is \r\nsomething that has won Ethiopia respect and \r\nadmiration from far and wide. \r\n As members may know, history has recorded and \r\nwill always remind us that Ethiopia — or Abyssinia or \r\nAl-Habasha — is often described as the haven of the \r\nfirst migration, or hegira. For Muslims, Ethiopia is \r\nsynonymous with freedom from persecution and \r\nemancipation from fear, for this was a land where its \r\nChristian king, Negus or Al-Najashi — whose proper \r\nname was Ashsama ibn Abjar — was a person \r\nrenowned for justice, and in whose kingdom human \r\nrights were cherished. As recited in various Islamic and \r\nEthiopian literatures, the famous Bilal ibn Rabah, or \r\nBilal al-Habashi, originally a non-Muslim slave from \r\nEthiopia who lived in Mecca during the time of \r\nProphet Muhammad, was known to have been an \r\nimportant and trusted companion of the Prophet. And it \r\nwas no coincidence that his native land, Ethiopia, was \r\nthe country chosen by the Prophet when his followers \r\nneeded protection and freedom from persecution.  \r\n That cross-religious understanding and \r\naccommodation has endured the test of time and events \r\nand lives on to further strengthen and deepen the \r\nbonds. Indeed, those are real historic instances of \r\ndialogue and cooperation. Their key message, which is \r\nstill valid in our times, is that we should all recognize \r\nthe existence of heroes of faith who do not see or treat \r\neach other as adversaries, but instead capitalize on the \r\ncloseness of each other’s faiths and seek to build \r\nbridges instead of impassable walls based solely on \r\ndifferences. That certainly applies equally with respect \r\nto all other religions and faiths. \r\n For us in Ethiopia, tolerance and respect for \r\ndifferent cultures, ethnicities and faiths is fundamental \r\nto our way of life. Indeed, we even consider it a \r\nquestion of survival, so as to make sure that the nation \r\nwill continue to be united, as it has been throughout its \r\nlong history and so that it will continue to thrive in \r\nunity and development, for the benefit of all. Nurturing \r\nmutual accommodation, understanding and respect \r\namong peoples of different cultures and faiths has \r\nremained engrained in our own traditions as a nation. \r\nIn a way, that is the whole essence of what we have \r\ncelebrated as the new Ethiopian third millennium over \r\nthe course of the past year, both at home and abroad, \r\ncherishing it along with others worldwide. \r\n The Ethiopian federal constitution is firmly \r\nanchored on principles including that of according \r\ngenuine recognition to and safeguarding the individual \r\nidentities and rights the country’s nationalities and \r\nensuring their full participation and representation. It \r\nalso enshrines our commitment to the objective of \r\npromoting unity in diversity. Thus, accommodating the \r\ndiverse identities of national groups, the right to \r\nself-determination and the establishment of a federal \r\nstructure that effectively devolves power to the grass \r\nroots on the basis of those principles are but some of \r\nthe major remarkable features of the political system \r\nnow in place in Ethiopia. \r\n Thanks to the federal constitution, the peoples of \r\nEthiopia have succeeded in further entrenching their \r\nage-old tradition and culture of peace and peaceful \r\ncoexistence as a tolerant society, embracing and \r\naccommodating all sorts of differences in terms of \r\ncultural identity and religious belief. As a token of that \r\nenduring virtue, a national Flag Day was officially \r\ncelebrated this year for the first time in the country’s \r\nlong history, to pay due tribute to the tricolour flag of \r\nthe nation. The flag represents an eternal source of our \r\ncountry’s strength and of the endurance of its diverse \r\npeoples, who have succeeded in surmounting untold \r\nchallenges for centuries, united as one and reaping the \r\nbenefits of peace, development, tolerance and mutual \r\ncooperation — which is the case all the more so today. \r\n Moreover, that innate mutual respect and \r\ntolerance extends to surrounding areas and the world \r\nbeyond the natural confines of the country, owing to \r\nthe fact that the principle of peaceful neighbourliness \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 10 \r\n \r\nand coexistence is one of the major pillars of the \r\nfederal constitution, and the foreign policy of Ethiopia, \r\nwhich remains a hub of peace and cooperation for \r\nmutual benefit and for development in our region and \r\nbeyond. \r\n The promotion of interactive dialogue and \r\nunderstanding among the major world religions and \r\ncultures is not a matter of choice or, as His Majesty \r\nKing Abdullah of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has \r\naptly put it, not a matter of luxury. It is rather a must: \r\nsomething to which we must all attach due significance. \r\nWe must undertake concerted action and manifest \r\nsustained commitment, to realize our hope for a peaceful \r\nworld, where tolerance, respect and accommodation, \r\nrather than rejection and confrontation, prevail and \r\nwhere misunderstandings based on ignorance and fear \r\namong peoples no longer exist. \r\n Indeed, the popular Holy Koran verse that was \r\nidentically recited by Their Majesties the King of \r\nSaudi Arabia and the Emir of the State of Kuwait, as \r\nwell as by other heads of Government or delegation \r\nwho spoke after them at this gathering yesterday and \r\ntoday, succinctly sums it up. And as its counterpart \r\nfrom the Holy Bible counsels us to treat our brethren in \r\nthe same way as we would wish to be treated by them, \r\nthe two great books truly complement each other on \r\nthis very fundamental point, as much as all other major \r\nreligions and beliefs around the world would have it in \r\ntheir teachings. \r\n Finally, as a staunch believer in the noble cause \r\nof interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace, and as a \r\nsponsor of the draft resolutions presented for adoption \r\nby Assembly to further promote this cause, I would \r\nlike to reassure the Assembly that Ethiopia remains \r\nfirmly committed and will continue to actively play its \r\npart in the pursuit of this paramount global initiative \r\nboth at home and elsewhere, near and far, because the \r\nenormous task of nurturing the culture of peace is a \r\ncrucial common stake for us all. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Gordon Brown, Prime Minister \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland. \r\n Mr. Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Brown (United Kingdom): I am delighted \r\nthat so many leaders who have served the world with \r\nsuch distinction and whom I admire for their \r\nstatesmanship have assembled from every faith and \r\nevery continent for this very special conference on the \r\nculture of peace and the power of dialogue. And I am \r\ngrateful that this conference is being held under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations and in this great Hall \r\nwhere so many declarations and decisions that have \r\nchanged history have been pronounced. \r\n Let me pay tribute especially to King Abdullah of \r\nSaudi Arabia, a man of great faith whose leadership \r\nhas inspired this dialogue. It is in recognition of his \r\nwork and that of the Secretary-General, whom I also \r\napplaud, that President Bush, the King of Jordan, the \r\nEmir of Kuwait, Presidents Peres, Zardari, Karzai and \r\nHalonen and Prime Minister Erdoğan and many, many \r\nmore have addressed this forum yesterday and today. \r\n Never has such a global dialogue been so critical. \r\nNever has this global leadership working for its \r\nsuccess been so strong and so inspirational. And never \r\nhave the global opportunities that might flow from this \r\nand then to conflict, division, misunderstanding and \r\npoverty been so profound and so necessary. For if we \r\nbelieve that our future peace and security lie together \r\nrather than apart, lie in understanding not in isolation, \r\nlie in the differences that we acknowledge and that \r\nenrich us and not the differences that divide us, then \r\nwe must speak to people’s values and speak to their \r\nbeliefs. \r\n More than two thirds of our fellow citizens are \r\nfollowers of the major faiths, so we can be in no doubt \r\nabout the power of faith to shape our world. And while \r\nit is not for politicians to lead that bringing together of \r\nfaiths — that can ultimately only be done by the \r\nleaders of faith communities themselves — we cannot \r\nsuccessfully lead nations without it.  \r\n History tells us that the greatest of social \r\nmovements have been built on the strongest of ethical \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n11 08-60083 \r\n \r\nfoundations. Two hundred years ago, was it not men \r\nand women of faith and religious conviction who \r\nsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of the slave \r\ntrade? They said that we could not be one world until \r\nslavery was ended. Fifty years ago, was it not men and \r\nwomen of conscience and religious faith who inspired \r\nthe civil rights movement here in this country by \r\nsaying that we could not be one world until every \r\nsingle citizen, whatever their colour, their race or \r\nbackground, enjoyed equal rights? \r\n And is it not men and women of conscience and \r\nreligious conviction who say today, as we said here in \r\nthis General Assembly only a few weeks ago, that we \r\ncannot be one world when 30,000 children die \r\nunnecessarily every day from diseases we know how to \r\ncure, and that we must together respond to this poverty \r\nemergency by redoubling our efforts to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals? \r\n This is the power of faith, to forge the greatest \r\npossible coalition for the common good — not one that \r\nseeks to impose uniformity of doctrine or culture, but \r\none that is enriched by diversity, united by shared \r\nvalues and empowered by a common commitment to \r\nmake our world a better place. \r\n Too often throughout history, people have seen \r\nthe foreigner as at best a stranger and sometimes, at \r\nworse, an enemy, and too often cultures and faiths \r\nappear to change at national borders as dramatically as \r\nfashion and language. But today we know we are not \r\nand never can be moral strangers to each other, because \r\nwe find that through each of our heritages, our \r\ntraditions and faiths runs a single powerful moral \r\nsense — a sense that we all share the pain of others, a \r\nsense that we believe in something bigger than \r\nourselves. Christians say, “Do to others as you would \r\nhave them do to you”. Judaism says, “Love your \r\nneighbour as yourself”. Muslims say, “No one of you is \r\na believer until he desires for his brother that which he \r\ndesires for himself”. Buddhists say, “Hurt not others in \r\nways that you yourself would find hurtful”. Sikhs say, \r\n“Treat others as you would be treated yourself”. \r\nHindus say, “The sum of duty is do not unto others \r\nwhich would cause pain if done to you”. \r\n Now call this the best angels of our nature, call it \r\nthe light in man, call it the moral sense, call it, as the \r\nphilosopher Adam Smith did, the moral sentiment. Call \r\nit conscience of fostering compassion. Call it the \r\nglobal ethic, the irrevocable unconditional norm for all \r\nareas of life, for families, communities, for races, \r\nnations and religions: most of us accept that what you \r\ndo not wish done to yourself, you do not do to others. \r\nIt is the same sacred ideal at the ethical heart of all true \r\nreligions — our duty to others, our concern for the \r\noutsider, the sense that each of us is our brother’s and \r\nsister’s keeper.  \r\n So to those who say that religion, and especially \r\nthat the misunderstanding and intolerance that has \r\noften existed between religions, is responsible for \r\nmany of the problems we face today, I say we will \r\naddress these problems if we act upon that moral sense \r\nthat is shared at the heart of all the great faiths of the \r\nworld. \r\n We have a unique opportunity in this new global \r\nage, in what is an interdependent world, to act upon \r\nthat interdependence and make a partnership by \r\nworking together for the common good. And what is \r\nnew in this global age is our enhanced ability to \r\ncommunicate with each other, to speak to each other \r\nacross continents. It was not so long ago that we would \r\nsay, “If only people could communicate across borders. \r\nIf only people could hear what their opponents have to \r\nsay. If only they could speak with each other and find \r\nthat they have so much in common, then the world \r\nwould be different”.  \r\n But today most of these barriers, these old \r\nbarriers to communication, are being removed. We can \r\nnow communicate with each other across frontiers, \r\nalmost instantaneously. Through the Internet, through \r\ntexting and through e-mailing, there are hundreds of \r\nthousands of social networks crossing the world; there \r\nare millions of people who may not inhabit the same \r\nstreet but now inhabit the same Internet site. It is in the \r\nencounter of listening, and being listened to, that we \r\ndiscover that the beliefs we have in common are so \r\nmuch greater than what has in the past driven us apart.  \r\n We discover what Britain’s Chief Rabbi, Jonathan \r\nSacks, calls the dignity of difference — people, he \r\nsaid, all made in the divine image, who find that they \r\nare possessed of a dignity and sanctity that transcends \r\nour differences. And we must act upon our \r\ninterdependence.  \r\n Recently, in Abuja, I visited a run-down and \r\ndilapidated school, where children were sitting either \r\non the floor without a desk or three to a desk that had \r\nbeen built for one. Their parents told me that a few \r\nmiles away, a far better school, a far better equipped \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 12 \r\n \r\nschool, offered free education. But the great facilities \r\nand teachers came at a high price, because they were \r\nfunded by an extremist group poisoning the children’s \r\nminds and attracting them to a life of terrorism. \r\n I believe it falls upon us to ensure the right to a \r\ndecent education, free of extremism, for every child in \r\nthe world. Think, if the achievement of this generation \r\ncould be that every child was able to go to school to \r\ngain an education to recognize what they had in \r\ncommon with other children, and I believe we could do \r\nthat, by coming together and spending $10 billion a \r\nyear — $100 for each child. \r\n But let us agree that first, we should do \r\neverything to fight extremism wherever it exists, so \r\nthat people understand the central tenets of their faiths \r\nand the rich association those faiths enjoy with each \r\nother. And we in Britain will continue to step up our \r\ncampaign, working with other countries, to separate \r\ndecent young people from the pressures of divisive and \r\nextremist advocates of terrorism.  \r\n Secondly, the values of different faiths are \r\nalready expressed in joint projects and common \r\nservice. In Britain, we have Muslim Aid, collaborating \r\nwith the United Methodist Committee in America to \r\nrespond to the needs of disaster victims in Asia. British \r\nMuslims working with American Christians to support \r\nAsian neighbours of all faiths and traditions gives us a \r\nglimpse of the potential of faith across our world.  \r\n As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, so we should \r\nalso see shared values through a shared commitment to \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. I have one \r\nother proposal about how shared values can bring us \r\ntogether: 40 years ago, the United States created the \r\nPeace Corps for young people from America to help \r\nthe world and, around the world, many countries, \r\nincluding Britain, have their own Voluntary Service \r\nOverseas organizations.  \r\n But in this new global age, should we not \r\ncelebrate the shared moral sense that is common to all \r\ncultures, all religions and all faiths by bringing young \r\npeople together in a global corps, perhaps a global \r\nenvironmental corps, a global community service \r\ncorps, a global peace corps and a global medical aid \r\ncorps, bringing young people of all nationalities and \r\nfaiths together with each other in a global effort that \r\nwill show the strength that comes from the world’s \r\nyoung people acting together? \r\n Thirdly, we should repeat the importance that \r\neveryone who has spoken here attaches to peace in the \r\nMiddle East and the creation of a Palestinian state side \r\nby side with an Israeli State that has its security \r\nguaranteed. We in Britain, with other countries, will \r\ncontinue to work for that objective, which, I believe, \r\ncan be achieved by goodwill in the Middle East. \r\n At this unique point in our history, when the \r\nworld is facing the first financial and resources crises \r\nof the new global age, the ability to come together and \r\nbuild shared solutions has never been more important. \r\n Let me send out the strongest message that the \r\nroad to economic ruin in the past has been following \r\nthe path of protectionism. The way forward is not \r\ncountries working in isolation from or against each \r\nother, but countries cooperating together. I believe that \r\nas world leaders gathered in Washington this weekend, \r\nwe must and we will see enhanced cooperation by \r\nGovernments to deal with economic problems that are \r\nnow hitting every continent in the world. But I also \r\nbelieve that what matters is a clear statement coming \r\nfrom this conference in New York that, far more than \r\nthe cooperation of Governments, the cooperation of \r\npeoples, whatever their faith, in each continent of the \r\nworld will determine whether we can build a truly \r\nglobal society. \r\n I believe that if, through our continuing dialogue, \r\nwe can come to recognize our common ground, the \r\ncommon ground on which we stand, whatever our faith \r\ntraditions, and a common commitment to peace, \r\nfreedom, prosperity, tolerance and respect — if we can \r\nmobilize a global movement around those shared goals, \r\nthen the achievements can be momentous. Together, we \r\ncan become the first generation to abolish illiteracy and \r\ngive every child the chance of education. We can \r\nbecome the first generation to solve the climate change \r\ntogether. We can become the first generation to \r\neradicate tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, malaria and \r\nHIV/AIDS from the face of the Earth. \r\n We can become the first generation to consign \r\nextreme poverty to the history books for all time. We \r\ncan become the first generation to do so by \r\ndemonstrating by our actions what this conference has \r\nbeen all about today, that the greatest social changes \r\nare built from the strongest ethical foundations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n13 08-60083 \r\n \r\nand Northern Ireland for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nEl Salvador. \r\n Mr. García González (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for this important initiative to convene a \r\nhigh-level plenary to examine the culture of peace and \r\ndialogue among cultures, civilizations and religions.  \r\n We would like to thank His Majesty King \r\nAbdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, for his \r\ncourageous and timely leadership on this subject, \r\nespecially against the background of the unprecedented \r\nmultidimensional crisis that the international \r\ncommunity is facing and that forces us to reflect deeply \r\non the consequences and examine possible joint \r\nsolutions within the framework of renewed \r\nmultilateralism and in the configuration of a new \r\nmultipolar world. \r\n El Salvador reaffirms its commitment to continue \r\nimplementing the Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction on a Culture of Peace, which are the strategic \r\nand programme base of the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of \r\nthe World for the period 2001 to 2010. \r\n Also, we agree with other delegations in \r\nacknowledging as a fundamental and inescapable issue \r\nthat the basic root of all global crises lies in mankind’s \r\ndenial of the universal principle of justice. \r\n The world in which we live is the only one, and \r\ntherefore we live and prosper as one in harmony and \r\nfraternal dialogue among cultures, civilizations and \r\nreligions, or we all face collective annihilation. Only a \r\ncomplete and orderly reconstruction of the current \r\nworld economic and political system will bring justice \r\nand peace. We must be aware that without justice and \r\npeace, the future will be truly bleak. We must therefore \r\nprepare ourselves to share and achieve jointly \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In the opening statement, by the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this high-level plenary, he rightly \r\npointed out that that multidimensional crisis could, and \r\nshould, become a joint opportunity to adopt the \r\ncourageous measures necessary to guarantee new \r\nlevels of coexistence among people and between \r\nourselves and nature, so as to ensure a better world for \r\nthis and future generations. He also said that we are \r\nobviously lacking the political will to move from mere \r\nspoken acknowledgement to the adoption of specific, \r\nsustained and coordinated measures at the local and \r\ninternational levels. In that regard, the United Nations \r\nhas very fittingly set out a complex programme aimed \r\nat achieving a better world. \r\n We are convinced of the accuracy of the \r\nPresident’s comments and, in particular, of his vision \r\nthat we are here today to commit ourselves to \r\nharnessing our moral strength in the service of the \r\ngoals of the United Nations which, at the end of the \r\nday, are for the benefit of our own peoples. As the \r\nConstitution of the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization reminds us, “since \r\nwars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of \r\nmen that the defences of peace must be constructed”. \r\n We should agree that peace is not just the absence \r\nof conflict, but that it also involves a conscious effort \r\nof creation and empowerment in the minds of people. \r\nTherefore, from my country’s perspective, the concept \r\nof a culture of peace is closely linked to the active \r\npromotion of dialogue and alliance among cultures, \r\ncivilizations and religions. All cultures, civilizations \r\nand religions are equal and therefore have the duty to \r\npromote dialogue to support values and principles \r\npromoting the culture of peace, including tolerance, \r\nrespect for others, mutual understanding, respect for \r\ncultural diversity, and support for non-violence and the \r\nprinciples that support peaceful coexistence among all. \r\n El Salvador remains committed to the \r\nimplementation of resolution 62/90 of 17 December \r\n2007 on the promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace, and specifically welcomes the declaration of \r\n2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement \r\nof Cultures. We are convinced that meeting our \r\nobligations in the universal promotion and respect for \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute \r\nthe essential basis for continuing to make progress in \r\nthe collective commitment to peace.  \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 14 \r\n \r\n We reaffirm the right to peace as one of the main \r\npillars of all universal human rights. We acknowledge \r\nthat the main challenge of the twenty-first century is \r\nextending and contextualizing the meaning of \r\ncollective security. Hence, deep-rooted, consensual, \r\ndemocratic, efficient and effective reform is necessary \r\nto generate the mutual trust that will enable us to build \r\npeace on a solid and sustainable basis. \r\n In that context, we encourage the Security Council \r\nand the Peacebuilding Commission to join in the efforts \r\nof the General Assembly to promote a culture of peace \r\nand non-violence for the children of the world. We also \r\nsalute and commend the active participation of civil \r\nsociety, including non-governmental organizations and \r\nthe private sector, in the promotion of activities aimed at \r\nthe culture of peace and non-violence, and especially \r\ntheir awareness-raising campaigns on the culture of \r\npeace around the world. \r\n Finally, I reiterate the political will of the \r\nGovernment of El Salvador to continue to actively \r\npromote the values and principles guiding the effective \r\nconstruction of a culture of peace to the benefit of all \r\nof our peoples. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give \r\nthe floor to the chairman of the delegation of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, let me express my appreciation for the \r\norganization and convening of this important meeting. \r\nI wish to begin my statement by reciting some verses \r\nof the Holy Koran that are relevant to the subject of \r\nour deliberations today. First, based on the Koran’s \r\nteachings, all nations dwelling on Earth share the same \r\norigin and, in case of any disagreement or dispute, they \r\nshould refer to divine rules. As it is said in the Koran, \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n“Mankind was one single nation, and Allah sent \r\nmessengers with glad tidings and warnings; and \r\nwith them He sent the Book in truth, to judge \r\nbetween people in matters wherein they differed”. \r\n(The Holy Koran, II:213)  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Secondly, there is no distinction and discord \r\namong the messengers of God and they all delivered \r\nthe same message to human beings. As it is said in the \r\nKoran,  \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n“Men of faith, each one of them believeth in \r\nAllah, His angels, His books, and His \r\nmessengers. We make no distinction between one \r\nand another of His messengers”. (The Holy \r\nKoran, II:285) \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Thirdly, all messengers of God are carriers of \r\ntruth from Allah, the Almighty, to the people, and are \r\ntheir guides towards God. As it is said in the Koran, \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n“He is He who sent down to Thee, in truth, the \r\nBook, confirming what went before it; and He \r\nsent down the Torah and the Gospel”. (The Holy \r\nKoran, III:3) \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n As a result of Islamic teachings and our rich \r\nculture, the Iranian people, a nation deeply rooted in \r\nthe history of mankind and one of the cornerstones of \r\ncivilization, have always respected other religions, \r\nnations and cultures. Although about 95 per cent of the \r\nIranian population is Muslim, the Constitution of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran has bestowed upon the \r\nreligious minorities in my country equal rights, and \r\neven in some instances a privileged position, and the \r\nright to freely practise their religions. \r\n At present, Iranian religious minorities are \r\nenjoying the equal right to representation in our \r\nParliament, regardless of the small size of their \r\npopulation. The practical commitment of the \r\nGovernment and people of Iran to the teachings of \r\nIslam and the provisions of the Constitution has \r\nresulted in shaping constructive coexistence among \r\nMuslims, Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians. As a \r\nresult, all religious minorities in Iran consider \r\nthemselves to be integral parts of the Iranian nation \r\nand are playing a constructive role in their society and \r\nenjoying the full freedom to practise their religions in \r\nmore than 500 places of worship, including churches, \r\nsynagogues and temples. \r\n Inspired by the noble Islamic principles of \r\nrespect for human diversity, the recognition of diverse \r\nsources of knowledge, the promotion of dialogue and \r\nmutual understanding, genuine mutual respect in \r\nhuman interchanges and the encouragement of \r\ncourteous and civilized discourse based on reason and \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n15 08-60083 \r\n \r\nlogic, the Islamic Republic of Iran has greatly \r\ncontributed to the promotion of dialogue at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n My country is well recognized for its widely \r\nsupported initiatives in favour of dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, religions and cultures, and solidarity for \r\npeace, the latter of which was proposed by the \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran last year. \r\nMoreover, as an important country in our region and in \r\nthe Islamic world in general, and as representatives of \r\nthe Shiite school of thought, we have been among the \r\npioneers of inter- and intrafaith dialogue and have \r\nparticipated in many such events to date. We consider \r\nsuch dialogue to be an opportunity and the proper \r\napproach to better articulating different ideas, visions \r\nand aspirations of and for human society and to taking \r\nadvantage of the collective wisdom of humankind and \r\navoiding conflict and violence. \r\n We believe that, in order to provide our societies \r\nwith more humane, safe and prosperous living \r\nopportunities, we must work together to bring about a \r\ngreater level of understanding and respect among the \r\nbelievers of divine religions. In our collective \r\nendeavour, we should not lose sight of the principles of \r\nour divine religions calling on us to exercise tolerance, \r\nrespect and compassion for those who belong to \r\nreligions other than ours. Islam, like other divine \r\nreligions, calls for tolerance and mutual respect among \r\nthe various nations and groups in order to preserve \r\ncohesiveness and solidarity in human society. This call \r\nis for the enrichment of human dignity, which is deeply \r\nrooted in Islam and other divine religions, as well as in \r\nmany cultures and civilizations. \r\n Since we are all in the same boat, it is necessary \r\nthat conditions be provided for every passenger to \r\ncollaborate in enhancing cooperation to nurture peace \r\nand harmony among different religions, cultures and \r\ncivilizations. Therefore, dialogue among the followers \r\nof the divine religions could bear the fruits of peace \r\nand friendship if it is undertaken in accordance with \r\nthe principles of equality and dignity of all parties and \r\nin good faith. In other words, all initiatives with a view \r\nto improving cooperation should encourage us to work \r\nto promote the essence and character of all religions — \r\nhuman dignity and integrity. \r\n We are of the view that this noble objective can \r\nserve as a shining light in the critical situation the \r\nworld finds itself in today. In our highly interconnected \r\nworld, if global challenges are to be confronted; if \r\nhegemony, domination, aggression and bitter conflicts \r\nare to be avoided; and if the common interests of all \r\nnations are to be secured, peaceful coexistence \r\nguaranteed, and lasting international peace, security, \r\nstability and harmony promoted, cooperation is not an \r\noption but a necessity. \r\n To ensure a satisfactory level of continued \r\ncooperation, there is an urgent need to utilize the \r\npotential on the ground. In this regard, we should \r\nattach great importance to dialogue as an essential, \r\nefficient and cost-effective way to bridge the gaps \r\nresulting from misunderstanding and misinterpretation \r\nand to promote mutual confidence and respect. \r\n All divine religions call for the peace, welfare \r\nand salvation of all people without any distinction as to \r\nrace, colour, sex, language, religion and political or \r\nother affiliation. However, throughout world history, \r\nthere have been examples of insults to or other abuse \r\nof religious values that, in some instances, have had \r\nlong-standing detrimental effects on countries and \r\npeoples subjected to such treatment. In today’s world, \r\ncertain countries and regions are victims of unjust, \r\ninequitable, partial and monopolized propaganda that \r\ncontinuously distorts the facts and realities relating to \r\nthem. \r\n We express our deep concern that Islam and \r\nMuslims are frequently and wrongly associated with \r\nunjust and unfair accusations, such as human rights \r\nviolations and terrorism. Similarly, the systematic \r\nnegative stereotyping of Islam and other divine \r\nreligions and the ridicule of religious personalities who \r\nare respected and beloved by believers of those \r\nreligions are sources of great concern for the world \r\ncommunity, and especially for the Islamic nations. We \r\nregret that these measures have been undertaken under \r\nsuch pretexts as the war on terror or the exercise of \r\none’s right to the freedom of expression. \r\n In this context, I would like to stress the essential \r\nneed for all people to live up to the responsibilities \r\nassociated with the rights they enjoy, particularly the \r\nright to freedom of expression. In line with our efforts \r\nto promote inter- and intrareligious dialogue, we \r\nshould prevent any attempt to abuse religious, cultural \r\nand racial differences. There is no doubt that such \r\nabuses sow the seeds of division, animosity and \r\nconfrontation among our nations. It is clear that any \r\nresort to such tactics or manoeuvres in our current \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 16 \r\n \r\ninterfaith dialogue would lead to division among us \r\nand result in our failure to reach our desired goals. \r\n Unfortunately, a representative of a regime which \r\nin its short history has been marked by crimes of \r\naggression, occupation, assassination, State terrorism \r\nand torture against the Palestinian people under the \r\npretext of a false interpretation of a certain religion has \r\ntried to abuse this meeting for his regime’s narrow \r\npolitical purposes. Undoubtedly, the participation of \r\nsuch a regime here not only fails to benefit our \r\ncommon purpose, but also, as proved in this very Hall \r\nyesterday, allows it to try to disrupt the current process \r\nand divert our attention from our mandate. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress its hope that, by promoting interfaith dialogue \r\nand respect for cultural values and civilizational \r\nspecificities as a means of celebrating religions and the \r\nachievements of our civilizations as the common \r\nheritage of humankind, the international community \r\nwill be able to provide the appropriate conditions for \r\nensuring the progress and well-being of humankind and \r\nto build an equitable new international order founded \r\non inclusion, participation, mutual understanding and \r\ntolerance among peoples and nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give \r\nthe floor to the chairman of the delegation of the \r\nRepublic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Park In-kook (Republic of Korea): We live \r\nin an increasingly complex world where globalization \r\nand collective identities are intertwined with culture, \r\ntradition, and religion. Over time, these elements are \r\nconstantly being pulled closer together in both positive \r\nand negative ways.  \r\n In the era of the Internet, global travel and instant \r\nsatellite transmissions, people are encountering \r\nincreasingly unfamiliar surroundings and new ideas. \r\nSometimes, those differences take the form of \r\nunexpected skin colours, cultures, traditions and \r\nreligions, which can produce anxiety about the \r\nunknown. It is paradoxical that the era of globalization, \r\nwhich is supposed to enhance mutual understanding \r\nand acceptance, is instead increasing intolerance and \r\ndiscrimination. \r\n The history of humankind is not defined by the \r\ncontinuation of wars and conflict. The centrepiece of \r\nhuman history is the culture of peace and coexistence \r\namong members of society, as well as among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions. Thus, we have to \r\nreject any entrenched predispositions towards endless \r\nconfrontation, struggle and an inevitable clash of \r\ncivilizations. Instead, we should further reaffirm and \r\ncultivate the culture of peace, tolerance and acceptance \r\nthroughout society, which has been the engine of \r\nhuman history and prosperity. \r\n The Republic of Korea has fully supported \r\ninternational efforts to advance the culture of peace \r\namong nations and various actors. Those efforts \r\ninclude addressing widening rifts between societies, \r\nreaffirming a paradigm of mutual respect among \r\npeoples of different cultural and religious traditions \r\nand helping to mobilize concerted action to that end. In \r\nthat regard, we highly appreciated the leadership of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon in guiding Member \r\nStates with his strong sponsorship of and support for \r\nimportant initiatives, including the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and the interfaith dialogue. As one of the \r\nmembers of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, the Republic of Korea endorses its \r\ninnovative and results-oriented approaches \r\naccompanied by substantial programmes. \r\n Religion is an increasingly important dimension \r\nof many societies and a significant source of values for \r\nindividuals. As such, religion should be a source of \r\npeace. However, the exploitation or misuse of religion \r\nby ideologues has led to the misguided perception that \r\nreligion itself is a root cause of intercultural conflict. \r\nIn fact, no religion promotes violence, but all promote \r\nthe ideals of compassion, respect for the dignity of life \r\nand the peace of humankind. \r\n Asia has enjoyed a long tradition of harmony, \r\ninclusiveness and peaceful coexistence. Similarly, \r\npeaceful coexistence, beneficial trade and reciprocal \r\nlearning have been hallmarks of the relationship \r\nbetween Christianity, Islam and Judaism, as many \r\nleaders of the international community have \r\nemphasized in our meetings yesterday and today. That \r\ntradition of peaceful coexistence should be restored in \r\norder to make the world safer. In that regard, we \r\nsupport the Madrid Declaration issued by the World \r\nConference on Dialogue and look forward to progress \r\non the recommendations of the Declaration as well as \r\nstrong leadership by religious figures. \r\n The Republic of Korea would like to share some \r\nof its views drawn from our own experience. First, my \r\ncountry has moved beyond colonization, civil war and \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n17 08-60083 \r\n \r\nauthoritarian rule to achieve full-fledged democracy. \r\nFrom that experience, we have learned that democratic \r\ngovernance — which includes the essential elements of \r\nthe promotion of human rights and the rule of law and \r\na commitment to pluralism — leads to an enhanced \r\nlevel of tolerance and respect for peoples and \r\ncivilizations different from our own.  \r\n Secondly, adaptation to the changing environment \r\nand addressing existing and potential conflicts are key \r\nto building a harmonious society. In that process we \r\nhave learned a variety of hard-won lessons that proved \r\nthat the core concept of a harmonious society is \r\ndiversity. We should not resist diversity or be afraid of \r\nit. Diversity is not a source of tension, but a source of \r\ndynamism and creativity. By promoting diversity, \r\naccepting differences and nourishing interactions, \r\nsociety becomes richer in culture and more open and \r\nflexible to change. \r\n Korean society is also rapidly becoming \r\nmulticultural, with a growing immigrant population. As \r\npart of efforts to fully embrace immigrants, foster a \r\nculture of acceptance and promote diversity, we have \r\nintroduced various initiatives, including multicultural \r\nfestivals, the distribution of a cultural guidebook for \r\nmigrant workers and the establishment of a \r\nmulticultural family support centre. \r\n Thirdly, the concept of tolerance should be \r\nreplaced by the concept of inclusiveness. Tolerance \r\nimplies that those who should be tolerated are still \r\namong the minority or exist as outsiders. Instead, those \r\nwith different religious or cultural backgrounds should \r\nbe accepted as full members of any society. In my \r\ncountry, Christianity, which was introduced only within \r\nthe past few generations, has now become one of the \r\nmajor religions. It has now taken deep root in the \r\nvalues and ordinary lives of people on the street.  \r\n A more recent phenomenon is the increasing \r\nnumber of followers of Islam. A Korea-Arab Society \r\nhas been established and new mosques are being built. \r\nIslamic culture is contributing to the diversity and \r\nharmony of our society. Regardless of an individual’s \r\nfaith or cultural background, we see that lasting \r\nharmony and peace can be achieved when people are \r\nincluded as insiders in society. \r\n My last point pertains to the global and regional \r\ndimension of intercultural and interfaith dialogue and \r\ncooperation. In order to address certain pressing issues, \r\nsuch as relations between Muslim and Western \r\nsocieties, a focused approach on the Mediterranean \r\nregion could be effective. Similar regionally focused \r\napproaches should be further expanded, taking into \r\naccount the regional dimensions of different regions, \r\nsuch as South Asia, East Asia and Latin America. Such \r\nregionally focused dialogue and cooperation should be \r\nseen as part of the comprehensive global scheme.  \r\n We hope that the scope of our efforts to \r\nconsolidate a culture of peace will embrace all cultures \r\nand religions, thereby spreading the values of \r\ncoexistence and mutual prosperity across a wide \r\nsegment of humankind. In the long run, efforts should \r\nbe truly global; and efforts at intercultural and \r\ninterfaith dialogue and interaction should be pursued in \r\nevery corner of the world. \r\n In conclusion, we must never lose sight of the \r\nfact that the history of humankind is based on peaceful \r\ncoexistence and mutual prosperity. The Republic of \r\nKorea will continue to devote itself to that end. \r\n Ms. Jahan (Bangladesh): Let me begin by \r\nthanking the President of the General Assembly for \r\norganizing this high-level meeting on the culture of \r\npeace. I would also like to convey our deep \r\nappreciation to the Custodian of the Two Holy \r\nMosques, His Majesty King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al \r\nSaud, for his instrumental role and personal initiative \r\nin holding this event. \r\n We are witnessing a growing misunderstanding \r\namong faiths, religions and cultures around the world \r\ntoday that not only threatens interfaith tolerance and \r\nmutual respect but also the very prospects for peaceful \r\ncoexistence. This meeting therefore provides a timely \r\nand excellent opportunity to share our thoughts and \r\nfurther consolidate the outcome of the Madrid World \r\nConference on Dialogue. We are confident that this \r\ninitiative will complement the purposes and activities \r\nof the United Nations in the related fields. \r\n We are living in difficult times. The proliferation \r\nof extremism and racism has assumed disquieting \r\ndimensions. Mistrust of and prejudice towards the \r\n“other” continue to persist. New manifestations of \r\nintolerance towards vulnerable groups, ethnic and \r\nreligious minorities, immigrants, refugees and migrant \r\nworkers are on the rise. The world is witnessing an \r\nominous trend of derision aimed at religious symbols \r\nand beliefs and the misuse of religion in acts of \r\nterrorism, violence and coercion. Defamation of \r\nreligions, religious stereotyping and incitement to \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 18 \r\n \r\nreligious hatred are disrupting social harmony and \r\ntriggering violations of human rights. \r\n The challenge before us today is to transform the \r\nwealth and diversity of civilizations, cultures, \r\nreligions, traditions and customs into a unifying force \r\nrather than a cause for division. We ought to take \r\nlessons from the setbacks of previous intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogues that focused on the differences \r\namong the faiths, religions and cultures. They \r\nerroneously attempted to fuse them together, touching \r\nupon deeply entrenched values and sparking conflict. \r\n We believe that all faiths and religions convey the \r\nsame message of peace, justice and human solidarity. \r\nOur approach should be to work on these common \r\ndenominators that unite us and build upon this premise \r\nof commonality. Followers of different faiths, religions \r\nand beliefs will have to sit together in fellowship, since \r\nin such frank encounters superficial and nominal \r\ndifferences quickly fade away. We believe that \r\ndialogue among civilizations, cultures and religions \r\nholds the best potential for promoting mutual \r\nunderstanding and the creation of a peaceful world \r\norder. \r\n We must encourage people-to-people contacts to \r\nbring down barriers and bridge gaps and differences. In \r\nthis context, my delegation associates itself with the \r\nMadrid Declaration of the World Conference on \r\nDialogue. The Declaration will, we believe, lend a \r\nfresh impetus to the global campaign for intercultural \r\nand interreligious dialogue. We deeply value and \r\nrecognize the contribution of the World Conference on \r\nDialogue to the international community’s series of \r\ninitiatives seeking to inculcate a culture of peace, \r\ntolerance, understanding and respect for human rights \r\namong various faiths, cultures and civilizations through \r\ndialogue. \r\n We therefore strongly support and encourage the \r\nMuslim World League in its endeavour to realize these \r\nlofty and urgent objectives. In fact, Bangladesh \r\nwelcomes all international and regional initiatives \r\naimed at promoting cross-cultural and interfaith \r\nharmony, which are mutually reinforcing. Given the \r\nmultiplicity of such initiatives, we would like the \r\nUnited Nations to take a comprehensive approach to \r\nstreamlining them, as they will find resonance in \r\nstrength and oneness in objective. \r\n The culture of peace is a set of values, attitudes, \r\nmodes of behaviour and ways of life that rejects \r\nviolence and prevents conflicts through dialogue \r\namong individuals, groups and nations. We believe that \r\na world order that is informed by a culture of peace is \r\nconducive to the attainment of our development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. We see \r\ngreat value in the principles of tolerance, respect for \r\ndiversity, democracy, and understanding. These ideals \r\nwere endorsed by Member States in the Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace in \r\n1999. Bangladesh was privileged to steer that process. \r\n As we enter the eighth year of the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for \r\nthe Children of the World, it is perhaps the time for \r\nreflection, new thinking and making an assessment of \r\nwhere we stand in terms of our commitment. We must \r\nset targets to ascertain progress towards creating \r\npeaceful societies, and we must strive towards that end. \r\n We wish to express our gratitude to all \r\nstakeholders who are contributing to the promotion of \r\na culture of peace. We also highly appreciate the \r\nongoing work of the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in the \r\nrelevant fields and that of other involved organizations, \r\nboth within and outside the United Nations system. We \r\nare particularly thankful to non-governmental \r\norganizations and civil society. In this pursuit, \r\nacademics and the media also have an important role to \r\nplay. We also need to involve youth in the process. \r\n Bangladesh enjoys a commendable track record \r\nof religious freedom, harmony and tolerance. Our \r\ncommitment and contribution to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping remain unrelenting. As a member of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, we are actively engaged \r\nwith peacebuilding responsibilities in strife-torn parts \r\nof the world. We believe a culture of peace holds the \r\nkey to sustainable peace in post-conflict societies. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to introduce, \r\non behalf of a large number of delegations, the draft \r\nresolution on the International Decade for a Culture of \r\nPeace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World, \r\n2001-2010, contained in the document A/63/L.23. Thus \r\nfar, 114 Member States have joined us in sponsoring \r\nthis draft resolution. We earnestly hope that, as in the \r\npast, the draft will again enjoy the consensus of the \r\nUnited Nations membership. This year, the draft \r\nresolution contains two new elements. \r\n Language is one of the most powerful \r\ninstruments for preserving and developing human \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n19 08-60083 \r\n \r\nheritage and identity. We believe that the promotion of \r\nmother tongues serves not only to encourage linguistic \r\ndiversity and multilingual education, but also to \r\ndevelop better awareness of linguistic and cultural \r\ntraditions throughout the world. This in turn inspires \r\nunderstanding, tolerance and cross-cultural dialogue \r\nand contributes to fostering a culture of peace. Out of \r\nthis conviction, we have incorporated a new \r\npreambular paragraph, the fifteenth such paragraph, \r\nwhich recalls the proclamation by UNESCO of \r\n21 February as the International Mother Language Day. \r\n Bangladesh is a traditional sponsor of the \r\nresolutions on interfaith dialogue and cooperation for \r\npeace. We are also a member of the Group of Friends \r\nof the Alliance of Civilizations. We acknowledge their \r\nvaluable efforts towards the promotion of a culture of \r\npeace and dialogue at all levels. The other new \r\npreambular paragraph, the sixteenth preambular \r\nparagraph, appreciates the ongoing efforts of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and the Tripartite Forum on \r\nInterfaith Cooperation for Peace in promoting a culture \r\nof peace. \r\n In conclusion, please allow me to reiterate our \r\nstrong support for the abovementioned, much-needed \r\ninitiatives that aim at promoting tolerance, peaceful \r\ncoexistence and exchange among the world’s nations \r\nand civilizations. Even if the challenges ahead are \r\nconsiderable, we believe that interfaith dialogue can be \r\na most effective method for bridging gaps and solving \r\nproblems arising from miscommunication, \r\nmisrepresentation and defamation. What we need is a \r\ndialogue that delivers, as the Secretary-General \r\nunderscored in this very same Hall yesterday. If we all \r\njoin such projects and seriously commit ourselves to \r\nour shared responsibilities, we will hopefully be able to \r\nascertain a more harmonious world for future \r\ngenerations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the chairman of the delegation of \r\nUkraine. \r\n Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, allow me to express my gratitude to the States \r\nthat initiated the inclusion of the item on the culture of \r\npeace on the agenda of the General Assembly. What \r\ncould be more noble than attempts that “are directed \r\ntowards respect for life, for human beings and their \r\nrights, the rejection of violence in all its forms” \r\n(A/52/191, annex)? This is exactly what the authors \r\ndrew our attention to 10 years ago in the documents on \r\nthe culture of peace. \r\n We, the Members of the United Nations, are the \r\nbearers of different cultures. We belong to different \r\nreligious denominations, but what unites us is the fact \r\nthat, within our religions, the human being is \r\ninterpreted as a creation of God. Why does it happen in \r\nhistory, and why is it happening currently, that the life \r\nof this creature of God is destroyed in wars and \r\ninter-ethnic conflict? Why are the rights of this \r\ncreature of God superseded by the political or \r\neconomic ambitions of certain individuals, groups or \r\npolitical parties? \r\n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n It is certain that, when the life or rights of the \r\nhuman being are attacked by another human or group \r\nof individuals who are the same creatures of God, these \r\nactions are guided not by the values of the grace of \r\nGod, but by evil. How can one resist the evil that, in \r\nvarying forms, poses challenges to humanity? The \r\nanswer is partly to be found in the debates on the \r\nculture of peace being held within the framework of \r\nthe sixty-third session of the General Assembly. This \r\ninterreligious and inter-ethnic dialogue must serve to \r\nfoster tolerance, mutual understanding and solidarity. \r\n At the heart of all United Nations programmes, \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals in particular, must \r\nbe a simple human being, the creation of God. \r\nOtherwise, noble plans and intentions will be \r\nsubstituted by perfectly worded yet soulless \r\ndocuments. The human being must be the first priority \r\nof all our undertakings. \r\n I consciously draw attention to this point because \r\nI represent a country that underwent a period of terrible \r\nexistence within the Soviet bloc, where the life of a \r\nhuman being was among the lowest priorities. Indeed, \r\nit was not a priority at all. The example of the \r\nHolodomor, our national tragedy of artificially created \r\nfamine, which over the course of 18 months claimed \r\nsome 6 to 10 million lives, is eloquent testimony to the \r\nutter neglect for the life of the human being in order to \r\nachieve political ambitions.  \r\n I often cite the following example, because it \r\nclearly illustrates the inhuman cruelty of the principal \r\nperpetrator of the Holodomor, Stalin, the Soviet \r\ndictator. This is how Winston Churchill described his \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 20 \r\n \r\nconversation with Stalin regarding the agricultural \r\npolicies of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, \r\nwhich claimed millions of lives. Sir Winston Churchill \r\nasked Stalin: “Have the stresses of war been as bad to \r\nyou as carrying through the policy of the collective \r\nfarm?” Stalin answered, “Oh, no. The collective farm \r\npolicy was a terrible struggle ... 10 millions ... It was \r\nfearful ... It was absolutely necessary”. That is how, in \r\nthe twentieth century, without war or revolution, not \r\nonly a single life, but millions of creatures of God were \r\ndestroyed. The justification for this act was that it was \r\nabsolutely necessary. \r\n If such cynical destruction of human beings and \r\ndisdain for their right to live are not to reoccur, we \r\nneed to tell the truth with respect to such crimes \r\nagainst humanity. Today, we should be grateful to those \r\nwho do strive for development and the promotion of \r\nthe culture of peace. We commend the particular \r\nattention that they give to specific measures at the \r\nglobal, regional and subregional levels. \r\n We can only hope that such powerful activity will \r\ngive us positive and tangible outcomes that will serve \r\nto bring about the rapprochement of cultures, to build \r\npeace and to eradicate hatred among peoples. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Viet Nam. \r\n Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): On behalf of \r\nthe delegation of Viet Nam, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening the \r\nsecond high-level dialogue on interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation for peace. I \r\nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport (A/63/262) on the activities carried out by key \r\nUnited Nations entities in implementation of resolution \r\n62/90. \r\n My delegation commends the positive measures \r\nundertaken over the past years within the framework of \r\nthe United Nations in promoting the culture of peace in \r\ngeneral, and in facilitating interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue in many parts of the world as a \r\nmeans to achieve this goal, in particular. \r\n Viet Nam supports the approach pursued by \r\nUnited Nations bodies and mechanisms, in particular \r\nUNESCO, the United Nations Population Fund, the \r\nDepartment of Public Information, the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nand the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, \r\nwhich advocates long-term measures focusing on, inter \r\nalia, further educating younger generations in the \r\nveneration of cultural and religious diversity. \r\n As we discuss interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace, we must be \r\nreminded that, while peace is the premise for the \r\nsolution of problems — such as hunger, malnutrition, \r\npoverty, and racial and religious discrimination — \r\naffecting the lives of hundreds of millions of people in \r\nmany countries and societies and a whole array of \r\nglobal issues facing humankind, such as climate \r\nchange, environmental degradation and HIV/AIDS, \r\npeace cannot be sustained without solving these \r\nburning problems. \r\n Interreligious and intercultural understanding and \r\ncooperation thus can be promoted only if they are \r\nbased on the shared desire to contribute to \r\nstrengthening the organic relationship between peace \r\nand development and the solution of problems \r\naffecting people of all faiths. \r\n We are deeply convinced that UNESCO and other \r\nUnited Nations bodies, with their pools of wisdom and \r\nexpertise, should play the leading role in coordinating \r\nMember States’ actions in promoting interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation. \r\n With a population of nearly 90 million, Viet Nam \r\nis home to 54 ethnic groups, each endowed with its \r\nown unique culture. In Viet Nam, apart from the \r\nworld’s major religions, such as Buddhism, \r\nCatholicism, Protestantism and Islam, indigenous \r\nreligions like Cao-daism and Hoa-haoism have \r\napproximately two million followers each. The many-\r\nthousand-year-long history of the Vietnamese nation \r\nhas been one of both constant interreligious and \r\nintercultural diversity and unity. The various faiths \r\nhave not only coexisted well but have also \r\nstrengthened each other, as required by the historical \r\ncontexts of our struggles for survival against alien \r\nforces and harsh natural conditions.  \r\n In the most difficult times, the Vietnamese people \r\nhave never failed to foster interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding, cooperation and harmony \r\nfor the preservation of national independence, \r\nsovereignty and peace. Interreligious and intercultural \r\nhostilities are foreign to our tradition. \r\n Over the past years, our country has adopted a \r\nseries of laws and policies that aim at protecting the \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n21 08-60083 \r\n \r\nnation’s diverse cultural values and guaranteeing the \r\npeople’s freedom of religion and belief. Education \r\nsyllabuses have been developed in eight minority \r\nlanguages, a special television channel has been \r\nopened to broadcast in 10 minority languages, and \r\nthousands of programmes have been aired by the \r\nnational radio in 13 minority languages. Great \r\nendeavours have been undertaken to help create scripts \r\nfor many ethnic groups who for ages only had spoken \r\nlanguages. \r\n The Vietnamese constitution provides for freedom \r\nof religion and for equality before the law among all \r\nreligions. Most recently, the United Nations Vesak Day \r\nwas observed in Viet Nam, with some 5,000 Buddhists \r\nparticipating, to uphold the philosophy of peace, \r\nharmony, compassion, non-violence, tolerance and no-\r\nself. The unprecedented candle-lighting event, involving \r\n20,000 people from all religious and non-religious \r\nbackgrounds at the closing ceremony of the event, \r\nreaffirmed the earnest aspiration of our people for a \r\nworld of peace and harmony. \r\n As I said earlier, interreligious and intercultural \r\nhostilities are foreign to the tradition of the Vietnamese \r\nnation. It is not unheard of for there to be attempts by \r\ncertain individuals, acting on selfish political interests \r\nwhile disguising themselves in the cloak of religion, to \r\ncarry out activities detrimental to the very fundamental \r\nfoundations of a culture of peace. The culture of peace \r\nconstitutes public order and the guarantor of equality, \r\nin both rights and obligations, for all religions before \r\nthe law, as well as the equality of all citizens before the \r\nlaw in both rights and obligations. \r\n In order to promote interreligious and intercultural \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace, it is the duty \r\nof all Member States to ensure that such attempts to \r\nabuse the religious freedom we all cherish and to \r\nsabotage our shared peace is foreign to our cultures. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Chile. \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I should \r\nfirst like to welcome this valuable initiative by Saudi \r\nArabia, which provides an opportunity for the General \r\nAssembly to consider the current state of the interfaith \r\ndialogue on the basis of the Madrid Declaration \r\nadopted in July. \r\n This debate is taking place a few weeks before \r\nwe commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the \r\ncommon standard of achievement for all peoples and \r\nnations. Article 18 of the Declaration establishes that \r\neveryone has the right to freedom of thought, \r\nconscience and religion. That right includes freedom to \r\nchange religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or \r\nin community with others and in public or private, to \r\nmanifest one’s religion or belief in a teaching, practice, \r\nworship and observance. Another provision of the \r\nDeclaration, namely, article 19, recognizes that \r\n“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and \r\nexpression”. Those are complementary provisions that \r\nare at the centre of the current debate, as are the \r\nequivalent provisions of the International Covenant on \r\nCivil and Political Rights. \r\n As noted by the Special Rapporteur on freedom \r\nof religion or belief in referring to the relevant \r\nprovisions of the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights, limitations to the right to freedom of \r\nexpression and opinion are designed to protect \r\nindividuals against direct violations of their rights, and \r\nnot to protect entities or belief systems. \r\n We are pleased that the Madrid Declaration \r\nrecognizes respect for human dignity and the \r\npromotion of human rights as a principle, as well \r\namong the bases for building good relations among all \r\npeoples. \r\n We believe that the process launched in Madrid \r\ncomplements other initiatives introduced under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations, such as the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and the process of the Tripartite Forum on \r\nInterfaith Cooperation for Peace. My country, Chile, is \r\nproud to participate in both initiatives. \r\n The role played by religion in the human rights \r\ndiscourse has acquired new relevance in recent years. \r\nMy delegation believes that that role is derived from \r\nthe recognition that human rights belong to the \r\nindividual, and not to abstract values or institutions. \r\nThat recognition is the foundation of the doctrine of \r\nuniversal human rights. \r\n We are concerned about the approach that values \r\nreligion and the objects of worship above individual \r\nrights. In the event of a conflict, that may mean that the \r\nlatter are subordinated to the former for the sake of \r\nrespect for a particular religion. A case in point is what \r\nis called defamation of religions. We believe in that \r\napproach, but it too could undermine the liberating \r\ncharacter claimed by every religion, and may also be in \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 22 \r\n \r\nopposition to human rights. As the Human Rights \r\nCommittee established pursuant to the International \r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights indicated in its \r\nGeneral Comment No. 10, restrictions on the exercise \r\nof human rights “may not put in jeopardy the right \r\nitself”. Restricting the freedom of expression cannot be \r\nthe automatic reaction of authorities to isolated events \r\naffecting a particular religion, however regrettable or \r\ncondemnable those events may be. What is ultimately \r\nneeded is more freedom of expression and more \r\ntolerance, and not less freedom of expression. \r\n We hope that initiatives such as today’s will serve \r\nto build bridges and provide solutions to intercultural \r\ntensions — solutions that, in this anniversary year, \r\nshould deepen our commitment to the cause of \r\nuniversal human rights. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Italy. \r\n Mr. Terzi di Sant’Agata (Italy): Allow me to \r\nexpress the appreciation of my Government for the \r\nconvening of this high-level meeting, and to thank the \r\nKing of Saudi Arabia, His Majesty King Abdullah bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud, for undertaking this initiative. \r\n Italy endorses the statement made yesterday by \r\nthe special envoy of the President of France on behalf \r\nof the European Union, to which I will add a few \r\ncomments. \r\n For a country like Italy, located at the centre of \r\nthe Mediterranean, dialogue with different cultures, \r\ncivilizations and religions is an essential element of its \r\nidentity, which is rooted in the long history it shares \r\nwith the States and peoples of Europe and with those \r\non the southern shores of the Mediterranean. \r\n We understand the importance of interreligious \r\ndialogue and the vital contribution that religions and \r\nreligious leaders can make to achieving United Nations \r\ngoals, such as in the areas of peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding, protecting human rights and promoting \r\nsocial and economic development. \r\n We should begin by reaffirming the independence \r\nof religions and dialogue among them from any \r\nGovernment interference. United Nations Member \r\nStates should not influence the contents of that \r\ndialogue, but they can certainly promote and facilitate \r\nit. We have to broaden the scope of our discussions \r\nfrom interreligious dialogue to a wider, more complex \r\nintercultural dialogue, including an exchange between \r\ndifferent religions, creeds and philosophical, ethical \r\nand humanist traditions. The objective must be to \r\nenhance mutual understanding and to welcome the \r\nnatural existence of diversity. Building a system of \r\ntolerance and respect for others that rejects any violent \r\nabuse of power paves the way towards the culture of \r\npeace, which is the subject of our debate in the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The debate yesterday and today, in which so \r\nmany heads of State or Government took part, is \r\neloquent proof of the great potential of interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue in contributing to peace and \r\nto the settlement of even the most complex political \r\ndisputes.  \r\n Through our different faiths and deepest \r\nphilosophical convictions, we must strive to recognize \r\nour human affinities and translate them into a message \r\nof peace. This is what I took personally from the words \r\npronounced yesterday by His Majesty the King of \r\nSaudi Arabia and by the President of the State of Israel, \r\nHis Excellency Shimon Peres: the practical application \r\nof a culture of peace. As President Peres said, “when \r\nnuclear weapons, long-range missiles, indiscriminate \r\nterror and fanatical incitement determine the agenda, \r\nall of us have to change that agenda” (A/63/PV.46). \r\n The tangible and effective openness to dialogue \r\nand exchange that we all perceived yesterday and today \r\ndoes not only convey a message of hope; it also \r\nconstitutes a prerequisite for making this change of \r\nagenda possible and attaining a fair and lasting peace \r\nin the Middle East, with the vital contribution of all \r\nsides: parties to the conflict, regional States and the \r\ninternational community as a whole. \r\n Today, the path to reaching a solution to this \r\nconflict is clearer. As His Majesty King Abdullah bin \r\nAl Hussein of Jordan rightly stated yesterday, “it is a \r\npolitical conflict and it demands a just, negotiated \r\nsolution that brings statehood and freedom for \r\nPalestinians and security and more regional acceptance \r\nfor Israel” (A/63/PV.46). \r\n Italy, a founding member of the European Union, \r\nhas always supported the significant initiatives on \r\ndialogue between cultures and religions that have \r\noriginated within the United Nations. We are convinced \r\nsupporters of the Alliance of Civilizations, which, as \r\nthe Secretary-General mentioned, is gradually \r\nstrengthening its effectiveness. Italy is an active \r\nmember of the Group of Friends of the Alliance. \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n23 08-60083 \r\n \r\n Similarly, we look forward to joining the \r\nconsensus at the end of this meeting to adopt the draft \r\nresolution (A/63/L.24/Rev.1), on intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogue promoted by the Governments \r\nof Pakistan and the Philippines. I would like to thank \r\nthem for this initiative. \r\n It is important, however, to underline that any \r\nreal dialogue between cultures and religions must be \r\nunderpinned by the recognition of the universality of \r\nhuman rights, including the freedom of religion, as \r\nenshrined in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and in articles 18 and 27 of the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \r\nArticle 18 of the Covenant states clearly that freedom \r\nof religion not only means freedom to adopt and \r\nprofess a belief but also the freedom to worship, \r\nindividually or in groups, both publicly and privately. \r\n The Republic of Italy, having experienced the \r\natrocities of the Second World War, was founded on the \r\nrecognition of those principles and values. It is by \r\nvirtue of that foundation that we cannot turn a blind \r\neye to events that touch the deepest chords of peaceful \r\ncoexistence. The Italian Parliament thus recently \r\napproved guidelines that encourage the Government to \r\nremain steadfast in the fight against religion-based \r\npersecution and discrimination throughout the world. \r\n Religious freedom is under threat in many parts \r\nof the world today. The United Nations must therefore \r\nfocus its efforts and action on the protection and \r\nintegrity of this fundamental right. One of the greatest \r\nthreats to religious freedom is intolerance. We strongly \r\nsupport the annual initiative of submitting to the \r\nGeneral Assembly a draft resolution on that matter and \r\nwe are encouraged by the fact that it has always been \r\napproved by consensus. \r\n I would like to highlight, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and other speakers have also done, the \r\nfundamental role of youth and young people in \r\ndialogue between cultures. The success of any dialogue \r\nnecessarily and especially depends also on young \r\npeople. It is that belief that led my Government to set \r\nup a youth forum for religious and cultural dialogue \r\nwith the purpose of encouraging young people to be \r\nleaders in supporting policies of tolerance among the \r\nvarious religions and cultural traditions. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Albania. \r\n Mr. Neritani (Albania): It is my honour and \r\nprivilege to address this high-level meeting of this \r\ninternational body of dialogue and negotiation — a \r\nforum in which every day world affairs are taken into \r\nconsideration with the aim of making the world a better \r\nplace for all of humankind. It is a particular privilege \r\nto represent my country and to join other speakers in \r\naddressing this very sensitive and highly important \r\nmatter, which directly affects the chances for world \r\npeace. \r\n We join other previous speakers in expressing our \r\ndeep appreciation to His Majesty The Custodian of the \r\nTwo Holy Mosques, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz \r\nAl Saud of Saudi Arabia, for his initiative to hold this \r\nhigh-level meeting; to the Mr. President of the General \r\nAssembly, and to the Secretary-General, as well as to \r\nall the dignitaries who have given their support to the \r\nsuccessful accomplishment of this meeting. \r\n Albania is a small country, but it has something \r\ngreat to offer to the world: its own example of the \r\npivotal role that cultural tolerance and understanding \r\ncan play in society. Throughout their history, Albanians \r\nhave always proudly demonstrated acceptance of the \r\nother and respect for his or her beliefs, building thus a \r\nsanctuary of harmonious coexistence between faiths. \r\nThis remarkable attitude of the Albanian people has \r\nbeen visible not only towards each other, but also \r\ntowards those who, in difficult times of persecution, \r\nhave found shelter in the traditional home of \r\nacceptance and understanding that is Albania. I refer \r\nhere to the unprecedented example of those Albanian \r\nfamilies, Muslim and Christian alike, who risked their \r\nown lives during the Second World War to shelter and \r\nprotect hundreds of Jewish families from the horrors of \r\nthe Holocaust. Even recently, during the 1999 Kosovo \r\nwar, Albania opened its doors and hearts to over half a \r\nmillion Kosovar refugees who had fled the campaign \r\nof ethnic cleansing waged by Milosevic’s military and \r\nparamilitary troops. \r\n Religion rests in the core of every civilization and \r\nas such affects the lives, attitudes, traditions and \r\nbehaviours of millions throughout the world. \r\nTherefore, respect for the religion and beliefs of others \r\nbecomes a quintessential element in building and \r\nbridging new perspectives of peace. Unfortunately, the \r\ncontrary is also true. Religion is very often misused by \r\nextremists to fuel dangerous fanatical ideologies or \r\neven nationalistic agendas that lead to confrontation \r\nand war. The recent history of our Balkan peninsula \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 24 \r\n \r\ndemonstrates this very clearly. For that reason, \r\nbuilding upon our own history, social texture and \r\ngeography, Albania as a country at the crossroads \r\nbetween East and West has made interfaith dialogue \r\nand understanding a priority for development and \r\nsocial stability.  \r\n Albania is at the forefront of supporting every \r\ninitiative at the regional and international levels which \r\naims to build understanding and trust among peoples of \r\ndifferent faiths and cultures. As an active member of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, we are currently \r\ndetermined to foster communication and interaction \r\namong the Alliance’s Group of Friends and to \r\nstrengthen confidence in this initiative. Albania shares \r\nthe belief of the partner countries in the Group of \r\nFriends that the activity of the Alliance should serve as \r\na road map with the potential, through its relevant \r\napproaches and concrete projects, to bridge the \r\nartificially created divisions between West and East \r\nand North and South, and among different cultures and \r\nreligions in contemporary societies. \r\n Our national strategy on intercultural dialogue \r\nreflects a centuries-old tradition of complete harmony \r\nand understanding among the country’s three major \r\nconfessions. It fully complies with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, the documents of the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nand the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and \r\nPromotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. \r\n I have the privilege of communicating to this \r\nAssembly Albania’s recent initiative to convene the \r\nForum of Interconfessional Dialogue in South-East \r\nEurope in January 2009, under the direct patronage of \r\nour Prime Minister Berisha, as a follow-up to a \r\nprevious regional conference held in Tirana in 2004 in \r\ncooperation with UNESCO. We have high expectations \r\nfor the Forum. In view of the new threats and \r\nchallenges stemming from conflicts, stereotypes and \r\ninterconfessional prejudices, Albania can render its \r\nmodest contribution to conflict resolution by sharing \r\nthe successful model of Albanian society. \r\n As this high-level meeting has demonstrated over \r\nthese two days, it is possible to strengthen our \r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue on a global level. \r\nWe hope that we will be able to keep this momentum, \r\nand Albania pledges its full contribution in this \r\ndirection. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Belgium. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium) (spoke in French): \r\nBelgium endorses the statement made by Mr. Alain \r\nJuppé on behalf of the European Union. The initiative \r\nof His Majesty King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud \r\nof Saudi Arabia, the Custodian of the Two Holy \r\nMosques, is an important contribution to promoting \r\npeace and dialogue among religions, beliefs and \r\ncultures.  \r\n Belgium is convinced that it is particularly by \r\npursuing dialogue that we can fight misunderstanding \r\nand prejudice. Our country is a melting pot of cultures, \r\nreligions and beliefs. We therefore see on a daily basis \r\nthe wealth that this diversity brings us. But this \r\ndiversity also poses challenges, and it is, inter alia, \r\nthrough dialogue among all the components of society \r\nthat Belgium is able to overcome them.  \r\n In this context, the respect for freedom of religion \r\nand belief is fundamental. To be sure, dialogue among \r\ncultures and religions is possible only if the freedom of \r\neach person to choose what he or she wants to believe \r\nor not believe is accepted. All of the various \r\ndimensions of this basic freedom — that is, the \r\nfreedom to have a religion or a belief, to not have one, \r\nor to change one’s religion or belief — are therefore of \r\nequal importance.  \r\n To be effective, this dialogue must be inclusive. \r\nAll of the religions and beliefs must be involved in the \r\ndialogue, without hierarchy or discrimination. This \r\ndialogue must also allow for calm discussion among \r\nbelievers and non-believers. In the same spirit, those \r\nwho belong to religious minorities must be protected. \r\nWe note that people who do not share the belief of the \r\nmajority too often face harassment and discrimination. \r\nIt is the responsibility of each country to ensure that \r\neveryone feels free and respected within their religious \r\nor philosophical choices.  \r\n The freedom of religion and belief can be fully \r\nexercised only if the other human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms are guaranteed. I am thinking in \r\nparticular of the freedom of association and of \r\nexpression. In the context of the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, which we will commemorate on 10 December, \r\nit is essential to reaffirm that the universality of human \r\nrights cannot be challenged. This is indeed a unique \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n25 08-60083 \r\n \r\nopportunity to implement the obligations that the \r\ninternational community undertook in 1948.  \r\n Article 2 of the Declaration proclaims that no \r\nperson can be discriminated against because of their \r\nreligion or any other opinion. It adds, in article 18, that \r\nevery person has the right to freedom of thought, belief \r\nand religion, and that this right includes both the \r\nfreedom to change religion or belief and the freedom to \r\npractise one’s religion or belief, alone or in community, \r\nboth in public and in private.  \r\n The wise authors of the Universal Declaration \r\ndescribed in simple but clear terms the fundamental \r\nobligations of States. These obligations are particularly \r\nmeaningful today. What may have seemed natural 60 \r\nyears ago might not be so today. This is why we must \r\ncontinue to be vigilant and to continue to implement \r\nthe obligations in a spirit of tolerance and openness \r\nthrough a dialogue among individuals of varying \r\nbeliefs.  \r\n To be truly fruitful, this dialogue must allow for \r\ntrue exchanges on the beliefs of each person. Religious \r\npluralism is a kind of wealth. This wealth also means \r\nthat the right to critique the beliefs of others, to discuss \r\nthem and to dispute them must be guaranteed. We will \r\nnot reduce tensions by preventing the expression of \r\ndiffering opinions. On the other hand, if that \r\nexpression leads to incitement to religious hatred, it \r\nmust be prohibited.  \r\n Over the past two days of debate, we have heard \r\na number of calls for dialogue between religions and \r\ncultures. However, it is just as important to encourage \r\ndialogue within these religions, beliefs and cultures. \r\nReligions and beliefs must indeed present opportunities \r\nfor exchange and communication, and not for \r\nimposition or constraint. The United Nations must of \r\ncourse continue to encourage that dialogue, but it must \r\ndo so while preserving the independence of political \r\nand religious spheres. The dialogue between religions \r\nand beliefs must continue without political \r\ninterference.  \r\n Belgium reaffirms its deep commitment to the \r\nfreedom of each person to be able to practise his or her \r\nreligion or belief. This policy is actively defended by \r\nour country, which not only recognizes a number of \r\nreligions and beliefs and subsidizes them, but also \r\nensures that no one’s rights are challenged because of \r\ntheir beliefs.  \r\n In 2005, we created a commission on intercultural \r\ndialogue, which made a number of recommendations. \r\nThe aim of the initiative was to ensure that Belgium \r\ncontinues to be an open society, within which people of \r\ndifferent cultures and ideas can cooperate in a climate \r\nof openness and tolerance while adhering to the \r\nfundamental values of our Constitution and human \r\nrights. Belgium has been able to draw a distinction \r\nbetween religious matters and those of the State in a \r\nharmonious manner. For example, it has taken a \r\nnumber of measures in terms of education and access \r\nto jobs, and in particular offers students in primary and \r\nsecondary school the choice between a course on a \r\nrecognized religion, such as Islam or Judaism, and a \r\ncourse on secular ethics.  \r\n To conclude, Belgium hopes that today’s \r\ninitiative will make it possible to reaffirm that \r\neveryone has a right to live with their religious and \r\nphilosophical choices without fear and without \r\nconstraint, in harmony with the society in which they \r\nare living. The initiative should also reassure those \r\nwho suffer under intolerance and discrimination due to \r\ntheir religion or belief, including acts of violence and \r\nintimidation, which continue to take place around the \r\nworld. Education and dialogue at all levels of society \r\nare essential to bringing about greater tolerance and \r\nmutual understanding in order to identify what brings \r\nhuman beings closer together rather than what keeps \r\nthem apart. \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Nigeria. \r\n Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): On behalf of the \r\nNigerian delegation, I congratulate the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on presiding over this high-level \r\nmeeting on interfaith dialogue under agenda item 45 on \r\nthe culture of peace. \r\n I also congratulate His Majesty King Abdullah \r\nbin Abdulaziz Al Saud of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\non initiating this meeting aimed at deepening the \r\ndialogue among cultures, religions and faiths in order \r\nto seek solutions to the myriad problems facing the \r\nworld. \r\n As the world continues to shrink into a global \r\nvillage in response to the forces of globalization, we \r\nare faced with increasing contact among peoples of \r\nvarious cultures, races and religions. Our differences \r\ncall for greater interaction through dialogue in order to \r\nbring about mutual understanding, without which we \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 26 \r\n \r\nwill continue to experience the consequences of \r\nignorance. \r\n Nigeria is very passionate about the dividend of \r\npeace. It is perhaps only natural that we should \r\ncontinue to encourage the promotion of a culture of \r\npeace, not only because we are a multi-ethnic and \r\nmultireligious society, but also because we have \r\nlearned over the years to coexist as one despite our \r\ncultural, linguistic and religious diversity. While that \r\nmay not be without its challenges, our country’s people \r\nhave become the better for it by learning to accept one \r\nanother as the same people, despite our differences. \r\nThus, for us, Nigeria is an embodiment of “unity in \r\ndiversity” — a slogan that has come to be appreciated \r\nby all Nigerians. \r\n To that end, the Nigerian Government has \r\nestablished the Nigeria Inter-religious Council with the \r\nmandate of promoting and fostering tolerance, \r\nunderstanding and solidarity among the major religious \r\ngroups in the country. Furthermore, many States of the \r\nFederation have established similar interfaith councils \r\nwith the deliberate objective of fostering tolerance and \r\nunderstanding. Additionally, we have established \r\nrelevant agencies with support mandates to foster \r\ntolerance, understanding and solidarity. Those agencies \r\ninclude the National Boundary Commission, the \r\nBorder Area Development Commission and the \r\nNational Orientation Agency. \r\n From our perspective, the strategy for building a \r\nculture of peace should focus on multifaceted and \r\nbroad parameters, including the promotion of \r\nunderstanding one another’s ways of life, devising \r\nmeans to resolve ongoing conflicts to prevent them \r\nfrom growing worse, developing institutional \r\nframeworks and relevant capacities for peace \r\ninitiatives, and mobilizing resources at the national and \r\nregional levels for peace initiatives. \r\n We also believe that the media could assist by \r\ntargeting programmes that promote peace, religious \r\ntolerance and dialogue among all faiths with a view to \r\npreventing the defamation of religions and cultural \r\nvalues. We in Nigeria believe that it is possible for \r\npeoples of all faiths to coexist in peace and harmony. \r\nWe hold dearly the right of every citizen to free speech, \r\nfreedom of religious practice and healthy respect for \r\none another’s convictions. We therefore wish to call for \r\ncontinuous meetings of interfaith and intra-faith \r\norganizations and for the periodic organization of \r\nseminars on topical issues that will facilitate the \r\nelimination of intolerance, disunity, conflicts and \r\nviolence. \r\n The promotion of peace and understanding \r\nthrough mutual dialogue, tolerance and respect for one \r\nanother requires a collective effort. It is therefore \r\npertinent for all of us to join hands in this endeavour in \r\norder to propel our world towards a more peaceful and \r\nprosperous future. We should also unite to \r\nde-emphasize the agents of strife and conflict among \r\nus as we pay greater attention to those issues that \r\ncreate a harmonious atmosphere, in order to guarantee \r\nfor all the peoples of the world their full and \r\nfundamental human rights, especially as we \r\ncommemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\n We are convinced that our diversity has been put \r\ntogether for us by the divine Creator for our benefit, \r\nand not for our destruction; for our strength, and not \r\nfor our weakness; for peace, and not for war. However, \r\nuntil we see it in that way, it will continue to be a \r\nnegative force, rather than the positive one that we all \r\ntalk about and desire. We need to make more effort to \r\npromote interfaith dialogue, as we believe that that will \r\nbring about an understanding of our differences and \r\nenable us to tap into our rich cultural diversity. It will \r\novercome intolerance and hatred and all false notions \r\nabout our various ethnic, cultural and religious \r\naffiliations so that we can truly live together in an \r\natmosphere of peace and love. \r\n In conclusion, let me share with the Assembly the \r\nconcluding remarks made by my country’s first Prime \r\nMinister at the fifteenth session of the General \r\nAssembly, on 7 October 1960, on Nigeria’s assumption \r\nof membership in this Organization:  \r\n  “Just one week ago the clocks were striking \r\nmidnight and Nigeria was on the threshold of \r\nindependence. There was a brief ceremony at \r\nwhich the leaders of three different faiths each said \r\na brief prayer. We then realized, all of us, that \r\nhowever much we might imagine ourselves to be \r\nresponsible for the happy occasion to \r\nindependence, we realize that, above all, there is a \r\ndivine Providence, and I do honestly believe that \r\none primary essential for international friendship \r\nand cooperation is for each man to be true to his \r\nreligious beliefs and to reaffirm the basic \r\nprinciples of his particular creed. It may be that \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n27 08-60083 \r\n \r\nthen, when we hear the world crying out for peace, \r\nwe may receive the inspiration to deal with these \r\nintractable problems and be able really to devote \r\nall our resources to the advancement of mankind \r\nby applying those persistent eternal truths which \r\nwill inevitably persist long after we ourselves are \r\nutterly forgotten.” (A/PV.893, para. 202) \r\n We note the scene captured by Mr. Gordon \r\nBrown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, contrasting a poor \r\nschool with a well-to-do school in Nigeria. Let me \r\nassure all members that there are no institutions in \r\nwhich religious extremists are bred in Nigeria.  \r\n Nigeria stands ready to contribute to and support \r\nall efforts geared towards the development of a culture \r\nof peace.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Rwanda. \r\n Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, my delegation would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report on interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace (A/63/262) and his report on the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for \r\nthe Children of the World, 2001-2010 (A/63/127). My \r\ndelegation also thanks His Majesty King Abdullah bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia for his contribution \r\nto the holding of this high-level debate. \r\n The subject of a culture of peace reflects the \r\nideals embodied in the Charter of the United Nations: \r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge and to \r\nfight for the creation of a democratic and just \r\ninternational order based on the equal respect for the \r\ndignity of all human beings. \r\n Whether these principles arise from faith in God \r\nor from simple humanism, respect for them by all \r\nStates would undoubtedly bring peace and security to \r\nthe world. Unfortunately, the reality of relations \r\nbetween States and among different religions and \r\ncitizens of different civilizations, tribes and ethnicities \r\nappears throughout history to be rife with division and \r\nwar. We think not only of the wars of religion in the \r\nMiddle Ages, but also of our day-to-day lives in \r\npresent times. We think of the various manifestations \r\nof terrorism, some more visible than others, but all \r\ndetrimental to peace in the world. We think, within the \r\nframework of the application of international law, of \r\ndiscrimination and bias of different protagonists.  \r\n I will give the Assembly an example of a case in \r\nwhich Rwanda is still a victim. Our head of State \r\nprotocol was arrested in Germany on Sunday, \r\n9 November 2008, while on an official trip, on the \r\ngrounds of an arrest warrant issued by France that \r\nabused the principle of the universal jurisdiction, \r\npursuant to a politically motivated report by a French \r\njudge. The principle of universal jurisdiction, like the \r\nVienna Convention, is, however, an instrument \r\ndesigned to guarantee peace and order in the world. \r\nThis example clearly shows how respect for human \r\ndignity and for conventions that should govern our \r\nworld could restore peace and order in the world, and \r\nyet can be diverted in the service of the strong.  \r\n That is why a high-level meeting on the culture of \r\npeace makes full sense within our Organization. This is \r\nan opportunity to recall that the Charter of the United \r\nNations has solutions that are beneficial to our \r\ndiversity and that great cultures and great civilizations \r\nall preach dialogue, tolerance and respect for human \r\ndignity, and that international conventions regulate \r\nharmonious relations among peoples. \r\n If we fill the breach of these divisions with the \r\nalliance of civilizations, religions and cultures, we will \r\nbe able to respond to the founding ideals of the United \r\nNations and for the progress of humanity. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Thailand. \r\n Mr. Pramudwinai (Thailand): At the outset, I \r\nwish to thank the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session for convening this landmark \r\nmeeting. I would also like to extend, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Kingdom of \r\nThailand, our sincere appreciation to and strong \r\nsupport for the commendable leadership of the \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King \r\nAbdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia. Thailand also appreciates the active role \r\nof President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the \r\nPhilippines, our fellow member in the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  \r\n Thailand shares the noble objectives and \r\naspirations that have been expressed during this \r\nmeeting and is ready and willing to do whatever we \r\ncan to support the realization of these objectives and \r\nA/63/PV.49  \r\n \r\n08-60083 28 \r\n \r\naspirations. Thailand is confident that this meeting will \r\nsend a strong and unequivocal message to all corners \r\nof the world that world leaders are united in the \r\ncommon pursuit of mutual respect and understanding, \r\ndialogue, tolerance, harmony and peaceful coexistence. \r\n Unity in diversity is what for many centuries has \r\ncharacterized a country that is today called Thailand. \r\nPeaceful coexistence is what the Thai people have \r\ngrown up with and practised in their daily lives, at \r\ntimes subconsciously. Because of its openness and its \r\nstrategic location between the Far East, South Asia, the \r\nMiddle East and the West, Thailand has long been at \r\nthe crossroads of civilizations, cultures, religions and \r\nmovements of people. From the past to the present, \r\nmany people of different civilizations, cultures and \r\nreligions have made our land their home, where they \r\nhave lived peacefully and harmoniously together as \r\nThais. \r\n Tolerance is also a part of who we are. That is \r\nwhy freedom to practise any religion or faith has been \r\nconsistently guaranteed throughout the country’s \r\nhistory. Today, while Buddhism is the religion \r\npractised by the majority of the Thai people, there are \r\nalso thriving communities of Thai people who practise \r\nIslam, Christianity, Hinduism, Confucianism and \r\nSikhism. His Majesty the King of Thailand himself is a \r\npatron of all major faiths in the country. \r\n For many who have visited Thailand, the sight of \r\nBuddhist temples, Islamic mosques, Christian \r\nchurches, Hindu temples, as well as places of worship \r\nfor Sikhism and Confucianism, all situated in the same \r\nvicinity is not at all uncommon. Nor is the sight of \r\nvarious cultural activities all year round that represents \r\nthe diversity of the Thai nation. Interfaith and \r\nintercultural dialogue is indeed not just something we \r\nenvision; it is part of our way of life. But we know that \r\nwe cannot take this unity in diversity in Thailand or \r\nanywhere for granted, and we will not. \r\n Forces unleashed by globalization have brought \r\ndown physical barriers. Globalization driven by the \r\nadvancement of information and communication \r\ntechnology has revolutionized the way that we see, feel \r\nand experience each other as a part of the human \r\nfamily. We are now closer to one another than at any \r\ntime in human history.  \r\n Yet, the very same forces that brought us so close \r\ntogether have also driven many of us so far from each \r\nother. Closeness and sameness sometimes create fear in \r\nmany vulnerable hearts and minds — fear of losing \r\none’s perceived identity in the face of globalization. \r\nUnequal and unjust distribution of the fruits of \r\nglobalization has also bred a sense of alienation among \r\nthe have-nots. This fear and alienation, real or \r\nimagined, especially among youth, have been exploited \r\nby those who harbour hatred and intolerance for the \r\nother, those who have attempted to sow the seed of \r\ndiscord and disharmony in the soil of unity and \r\nharmony, and those who have distorted the \r\ncompassionate and noble teachings of religions for \r\ntheir narrow self-serving interests. \r\n These people of ill-will want to divide us. They \r\nwant to make the clash of civilizations a self-fulfilling \r\nprophecy. But they will not succeed because we will \r\nnot let them. It is important that we do all we can to \r\nunite when they want to divide, to reach out to each \r\nother where they want to separate, and, together, bring \r\nthe full force of compassion and common humanity to \r\nbear on those who preach intolerance and the “us \r\nversus them” paradigm. \r\n Unity, harmony and compassion have to be \r\ncontinuously nurtured and strengthened. Thailand is \r\ncommitted to actively promoting unity, harmony and \r\ncompassion everywhere in the world because we \r\nbelieve that success in one part will contribute to the \r\nsuccess of all, for we are part of the same human \r\nfamily. We have been involved in many initiatives, \r\nranging from those at the community level to those at \r\nthe national, regional, cross-regional and global levels. \r\n For example, in June 2008, Thailand hosted, \r\ntogether with the Netherlands, the Fourth Asia-Europe \r\nMeeting (ASEM) Interfaith Dialogue in Amsterdam. \r\nThe Meeting brought together participants from Asia \r\nand Europe to meet face to face in order to have a \r\n“faith-to-faith” dialogue. Furthermore, as Chair of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nThailand will continue to work closely with our \r\nASEAN family members to ensure that ASEAN will \r\ncontinue to be a shining example of unity in diversity. \r\nWe will also continue to participate actively in various \r\nmeetings within the framework of interfaith dialogue \r\nand the Alliance of Civilizations. In 2010, Thailand \r\nwill host the Third Asia-Middle East Dialogue with the \r\naim of enhancing mutual understanding and fostering \r\ncloser ties between East Asia and the Middle East. \r\n We view all those initiatives as mutually \r\nreinforcing, but we are also well aware of the fact that \r\n A/63/PV.49\r\n \r\n29 08-60083 \r\n \r\nthe extent to which they succeed will depend on how \r\nwell we translate ideas and wisdoms into concrete \r\naction for the benefit of our people on the ground. To \r\nthat end, Thailand would like to highlight the following \r\nthree key points. \r\n First, multi-stakeholder leadership at all levels is \r\nvital. Political, religious and community leaders have \r\nkey roles to play in promoting and reinforcing unity, \r\nharmony and compassion. Other sectors of society, \r\nespecially the media, should also be brought on board. \r\nAll of us should do all we can to ensure that the \r\nenhanced power of the media in this globalized world \r\nis channelled towards positive endeavours in pursuit of \r\nunderstanding, harmony and peace among various \r\ncommunities. \r\n Secondly, we should strive to disseminate correct \r\ninterpretations of the principles and teachings of our \r\nrespective religions and faiths, while also promoting \r\nrespect for other religions and faiths. Voices of \r\nmoderation, tolerance and compassion should be \r\npromoted. So far, Thailand has been working closely \r\nwith our friends in the region and beyond to encourage \r\nmore frequent exchanges of religious leaders and \r\nscholars. We are truly grateful to all our friends near \r\nand far for their cooperation. We are particularly \r\ngrateful to His Majesty King Abdullah bin Al Hussein \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for graciously \r\nbringing the Amman Message to Thailand during his \r\nvisit to Thailand in 2005. We were also very pleased at \r\nlast year’s visit to Thailand by Mr. Mohamed Sayed \r\nTantawi, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar of Egypt. We \r\nwere very touched by his message of peace, tolerance \r\nand harmony. \r\n Thirdly, we must give all possible attention to our \r\nyoung people. We must instil love, compassion, mutual \r\nrespect, tolerance and non-violence in them from an  \r\n \r\n \r\nearly age. That can be done through both formal \r\neducation and extracurricular activities. We must do \r\nour utmost to prevent a sense of alienation from \r\ndeveloping in the minds of our young people, because \r\nthat will make them vulnerable to intolerant ideologies.  \r\n As for those who have been alienated and \r\nexposed to intolerance, we must help them to unlearn \r\nthose experiences and redirect them towards a right \r\ncourse of action. In that regard, Thailand has been \r\npromoting youth exchanges between various regions of \r\nthe country and with other countries in various parts of \r\nthe world in order to widen their world views and \r\npromote mutual understanding and the appreciation of \r\ndifferences. On that note, we see much relevance in the \r\nglobal youth cause, as called for two hours ago by the \r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom, and stand ready \r\nto support that idea.  \r\n Early next year, Thailand will host the ASEM \r\nInterfaith Cultural Youth Camp Project, which will \r\nprovide a forum for Asian and European young people \r\nto get to know one another and to engage in interfaith \r\nand intercultural activities. \r\n This General Assembly meeting is a powerful \r\ndemonstration of global leadership that will certainly \r\nhave profound implications. But it is not the end of the \r\njourney; rather, it marks a new chapter in the global \r\neffort to foster a culture of peace and promote \r\ninterfaith dialogue. The challenge for us is to convey \r\nthis message of peace, unity, compassion, tolerance and \r\nharmony to all houses, classrooms and community \r\ncentres in each and every country, for when our \r\npeoples share a passion for compassion, the culture of \r\npeace will prevail. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
