(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nHigh-level plenary meeting on the theme “Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs: state of implementation of \r\nvarious commitments, challenges and the way \r\nforward” \r\n \r\nAgenda item 57 (continued) \r\n \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support  \r\n \r\n (a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and international \r\nsupport  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/63/L.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now take a decision on draft resolution A/63/L.1, \r\nentitled “Political declaration on Africa’s development \r\nneeds”. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/63/L.1? \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.1 was adopted (resolution \r\n63/1). \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nthe President of the United Republic of Tanzania and \r\nChairman of the African Union, His Excellency \r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete. \r\n President Kikwete: This has been a great day for \r\nAfrica. The adoption of the political declaration is yet \r\nanother strong signal of the United Nations \r\ncommitment to Africa’s future and of the international \r\ncommunity’s partnership with Africa. \r\n I welcome the strong statements of support for \r\nAfrica made at the opening plenary meeting, as well as \r\nthe refreshing and frank discussions in the round tables \r\non Africa’s challenges, the state of implementation of \r\nvarious commitments and, especially, the way forward. \r\nI was also happy with the fact that there were 15 side \r\nevents on topics ranging from women and development \r\nto the food crisis, energy and the challenge of governance. \r\nThe side events witnessed a remarkable assembly of \r\nexpertise on Africa-African and non-African alike. The \r\noutcome of those discussions certainly enriched the \r\npolitical declaration that we adopted here a few \r\nminutes ago. \r\n I also welcome the press conference alongside \r\nMr. Donald Kaberuka, President of the African \r\nDevelopment Bank. We had a chance to engage the \r\nUnited Nations press corps. \r\n It has been a successful day for Africa. There has \r\nbeen a lot of talk in the past about Africa’s \r\ndevelopment; today, I was encouraged by the \r\ntremendous resolve to act. Let us go forth with \r\nrenewed momentum so that, when we look back on this \r\nday, we can testify that we were there when history \r\nwas made — indeed, when the world awoke to its \r\nmoral and shared responsibility towards Africa. \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The President: I wish from the outset to express \r\nmy gratitude to my facilitators, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Angola and the Netherlands, for \r\nA/63/PV.4  \r\n \r\n08-51593 2 \r\n \r\nconducting the intergovernmental consultations on the \r\ndeclaration we have just adopted.  \r\n We have come to the end of our day of dynamic \r\ndeliberations on Africa’s special development needs. \r\nNow comes the hard part: keeping the promises. Let us \r\nnot repeat history by breaking them. Let us rise to the \r\noccasion and make poverty history instead. \r\n The declaration we have just adopted, by \r\nconsensus, contains an agenda for action: urgent \r\naction. Eradicating poverty, particularly in Africa is the \r\ngreatest global challenge facing the world today. Our \r\ndeclaration says that it is a global challenge that must \r\nbe addressed, by and large, by the only truly global \r\ninstitution: the United Nations. That is why the \r\ndeclaration states that a stronger Africa requires a \r\nstronger United Nations.  \r\n The declaration and our exchange today have \r\nstrengthened my conviction that we have chosen the \r\nright priorities for this session of the General \r\nAssembly: Africa’s priorities are the Assembly’s \r\npriorities. Apart from the great global challenge of \r\npoverty, the food crisis is prominently featured, along \r\nwith its potentially ruinous impact on the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. Also key is \r\nAfrica’s vulnerability to the effects of climate change \r\nand the need for new and additional resources to deal \r\nwith them. Moreover, Africa’s own commitments to the \r\nwater and sanitation goals are highlighted in the \r\ndeclaration, along with the need to place women’s \r\nempowerment at the heart of development policies. \r\n The democratization of the United Nations, the \r\nkey objective of the General Assembly, resonates in \r\nthis document as well: we read about “the need to \r\nenhance the voice and participation of developing \r\ncountries in policymaking in the areas of trade, money \r\nand finance” (para. 19). While this high-level meeting \r\nitself reinforces international democratization by \r\nraising the profile of the world’s most representative \r\norgan — the General Assembly — we need to ensure \r\nthat each single voice counts and that the Assembly can \r\nmake the difference. \r\n It is high time for the General Assembly to take \r\nback from the Group of Eight (G8) and the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions the initiative in the development \r\ndebate in general and with regard to Africa in \r\nparticular: no barricades, no barbed wire, no tear gas. \r\nWe need to move the debate from seclusion to \r\ninclusion: that is what development is all about and \r\nthat is what only this Assembly can offer. \r\n The General Assembly is the body where the \r\nAfrican continent constitutes the largest group and \r\nwhere the African voice is heard at its loudest and \r\nclearest. But we are not listening to that voice nearly \r\nenough: according to the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development (OECD), less than half \r\nof all aid is directed towards the national priorities of \r\ndeveloping country Governments. Many here have \r\ndenounced the fall in official development assistance \r\n(ODA), including the portion allocated to agriculture, a \r\npriority of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) from the start, which stands \r\nnow at only 7 per cent of overall development \r\nassistance. That, coupled with the agricultural \r\nsubsidies granted by developed countries, portrays a \r\ncatastrophic scenario, which must be addressed if we \r\nare to defeat the ongoing food crisis. \r\n Railroading African Governments by ignoring \r\nNEPAD’s priorities will not get the continent on track \r\nfor attaining the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nRallying around African priorities instead will go a \r\nlong way, and the Assembly can lead the way. That is \r\nwhat we have seen today. \r\n I will not try to summarize today’s rich \r\ndiscussion. Let me briefly highlight some common \r\nthreads. There is a sense of emergency, and concrete \r\nactions must follow suit. Africa’s future ultimately lies \r\nin the hands of Africans themselves: development \r\nstarts at home. But it is clear that Africa’s efforts must \r\nbe complemented with a substantial change in \r\ninternational economic and trade policies. In that \r\nregard, debt relief must be tackled more aggressively \r\nso as to free the necessary funds for social investment \r\ninstead of paying what has become an ad vitam \r\naeternam debt. There is also a huge expectation that \r\ndonor countries will ultimately abide by their pledges \r\nand fulfil their commitments to double ODA by 2010. \r\n Home-grown political and economic reforms, \r\nincluding those focused on strengthening democracy \r\nand human rights and creating a healthy private sector, \r\nneed to be complemented with resources from the \r\noutside: Africa lacks the resources to pull itself out of \r\nthe poverty trap alone. \r\n International aid is not just a matter of the heart. \r\nIt is also a matter of the head, a matter of real and \r\nconcrete political will. An African renaissance is in the \r\n A/63/PV.4\r\n \r\n3 08-51593 \r\n \r\ncommon interest. If we are to bring about that \r\nrenaissance, we need to look beyond aid alone: \r\ndevelopment, security and human rights are interlinked \r\nand mutually reinforcing — they form a trinity. Hence \r\nthe imperious necessity to concentrate our efforts on \r\nthe social development of Africa: the sine qua non \r\ncondition for peace, security and respect for all human \r\nrights. \r\n Many participants pointed out that today’s \r\nmeeting is the first in a series of three this autumn. \r\nToday is about Africa, about the place on which we \r\nneed to concentrate our development efforts. The \r\nsecond meeting, this Thursday, 25 September, is about \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the themes \r\nthat require more attention. And finally, the upcoming \r\nFinancing for Development Review Conference to take \r\nplace in November in Doha will be about how to \r\nmuster the financial resources and the political resolve \r\nto keep our promises. We must closely monitor \r\nwhether commitments are indeed being turned into \r\nconcrete actions. I am pleased that the declaration sets \r\nthe basis for such a monitoring mechanism. \r\n Before I close, I want to pay tribute to President \r\nThabo Mbeki. During his presidency of the rainbow \r\nnation, spanning nearly a decade, he, along other \r\nAfrican leaders, championed the vision of NEPAD we \r\nstill pursue today. When the affluent listen to Africa \r\nand partner with it, that vision is within reach. To quote \r\nNEPAD’s founding document: “In fulfilling its \r\npromise, this agenda must give hope to the emaciated \r\nAfrican child that the twenty-first century is indeed \r\nAfrica’s century” (A/57/304, annex, para. 207).  \r\n As was highlighted this morning, today’s mantra \r\nshould be “implementation”: implementation of all the \r\ncommitments to our African brothers and sisters. After \r\nspeeches of solemnity comes the test of solidarity.  \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded its high-level \r\nplenary meeting on the theme “Africa’s development \r\nneeds: state of implementation of various \r\ncommitments, challenges and the way forward”. The \r\nAssembly has also thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 57.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
