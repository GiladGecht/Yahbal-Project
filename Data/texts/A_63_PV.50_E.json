(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Mbuende \r\n(Namibia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 45 (continued) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/262) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/127) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/63/L.23 and \r\nA/63/L.24/Rev.1) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ecuador. \r\n Mr. Morejón (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): It is \r\na great honour to address the Assembly on behalf of \r\nthe people and the Government of Ecuador, a country \r\nthat is convinced that dialogue, equality under the law \r\nfor all peoples, mutual respect, self-determination, \r\ncooperation and peaceful coexistence are the \r\nfundamental principles which should guide relations \r\namong States. Ecuador supports the pacific settlement \r\nof international disputes and conflicts and emphatically \r\nrejects the threat or use of force as a mechanism to \r\nresolve them. We therefore condemn interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States, as well as any form of \r\nintervention. Loyal to those principles, my country \r\npromotes peace and universal disarmament and \r\ncondemns the development and use of weapons of \r\nmass destruction.  \r\n As a founding Member of the United Nations, \r\nEcuador has enshrined in its legal structure the \r\nstandards set out in the Charter, as well as the \r\nprinciples derived from the Constitution of UNESCO \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But \r\nwe have gone further. In our new political constitution, \r\nrecently approved by a vast majority in a public \r\nreferendum, Ecuador proclaims itself a State of law, in \r\nwhich all individuals, groups, associations, educational \r\ncommunities, enterprises and institutions enjoy in their \r\ndaily activity a firm commitment based on respect for \r\nlife, rejection of violence, understanding, \r\nenvironmental preservation and solidarity as essential \r\nelements for attaining social inclusion and equality. \r\nFurthermore, the new constitution of Ecuador \r\ncondemns the imposition of bases or installations with \r\nmilitary purposes by one State on the territory of \r\nanother, since we have declared our country to be a \r\nterritory of peace. \r\n Additionally, my country has established \r\ntolerance and multiculturalism as basic principles, \r\nrespecting all types of religion and worship, including \r\nthe enormous spiritual richness of our indigenous and \r\nAfro-Ecuadorian peoples. As President Rafael Correa \r\nDelgado, an economist by training, stated during the \r\ncommemoration of the tenth anniversary of the signing \r\nof Peace Accord with our brotherly country Peru, “we \r\nhave to build a profound sustainable peace on the basis \r\nof development and justice”. That is precisely what we \r\nare doing in Ecuador; we are building peace each and \r\nevery day with commitment and effort and based on \r\nsocial justice, equality, dignity and respect. We are \r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 2 \r\n \r\ncommitted to building a supportive human society that \r\nfosters regional integration. \r\n To that end and convinced that peace brings \r\nprogress, our current Administration, since taking \r\noffice, has actively participated with its Peruvian \r\ncounterpart in implementing innumerable projects in \r\nthe area of the southern Ecuadorian border, dealing \r\nwith many different issues, including transportation, \r\ntrade, mutual trust measures, irrigation channels, \r\ntourist plans, highways and country roads, migration \r\nmechanisms, educational and cultural exchange \r\nprogrammes, hydroelectric stations, environmental \r\nmeasures, a bi-national park for peace, among other \r\nthings, involving a joint investment of $2 billion for \r\nexecuting projects. Those projects, as our President has \r\nsaid, evince our political will to change the \r\ndevelopment pattern. Today we are trying to strengthen \r\nthe border and move towards a human security \r\nconcept. \r\n We in Ecuador firmly believe that the human \r\nbeing must be considered the central concern of the \r\ninternational order and that strict respect for human, \r\ncivil, political, economic, social, cultural and collective \r\nrights must form the core of foreign policy, based on \r\nthe premise that human rights are universal, \r\ninterdependent and indivisible. The application of \r\nthose principles must be guided by the principles of \r\nuniversality, impartiality, objectivity and non-\r\nselectivity, with the recognition that constructive \r\ndialogue and cooperation is necessary in order to foster \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, including the right to \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The same view applies with regard to the \r\nimplementation of Plan Ecuador in area of the border \r\nzone with Colombia. Its purpose is to conceive human \r\nsecurity as a result of peace and development. That \r\nplan is based on three fundamental axes: first, \r\nstrengthening security and the culture of peace, centred \r\non the human being and based upon the satisfaction of \r\ntheir needs and the achievement of their full potential \r\nin terms of capabilities and freedoms. Secondly, it \r\nfosters the maintenance of equitable international \r\nrelations in solidarity with others; and thirdly, it \r\naffirms a defense policy based on the protection of \r\npopulations and natural resources, national heritage \r\nand effective control of one’s territory. \r\n Owing to the impact of the internal Colombian \r\nconflict on Ecuadorian society, Plan Ecuador is focused \r\non multidimensional and multi-sector prevention \r\nefforts aimed at solving the grave problems resulting \r\nfrom poverty, exclusion and violence. Its \r\nimplementation is based on achieving national social \r\nand economic development objectives, strict \r\ncompliance with international agreements in the field \r\nof human rights, conservation and the sustainable \r\nexploitation of natural resources and the fight against \r\nall kinds of illegal activities affecting human security. \r\n We propose to that effect the strengthening of the \r\neconomy of the border provinces, improvement in the \r\nquality of life of the people, increasing the presence \r\nand the coordination of our State institutions and \r\nstrengthening the management capacity of Government \r\nand local social organizations. That is the only way to \r\nrespond efficiently and in a timely manner to the \r\nincreased number of social problems and those \r\nresulting from the displacement of groups of people by \r\nthe internal conflict in Colombia to strengthen \r\nhumanitarian aid, minimize the environmental impact \r\nof production activities and to keep the population \r\nfrom getting involved in illegal activities. \r\n Plan Ecuador is a starting point that sets the \r\npolitical agenda of the Government regarding the \r\nnorthern border. That instrument has been enriched \r\nwith the help and participation of the main local actors. \r\n The refugee issue in the northern border area is a \r\nnational priority for my country as we seek to build our \r\nculture of peace. In order to foster comprehensive \r\neconomic and social development and build a zone of \r\npeace, as conceived by Plan Ecuador, State policies \r\nregarding refugees must guarantee their protection and \r\nat the same time provide a lasting solution for those \r\nhundreds of thousands of Colombians who need \r\ninternational protection. \r\n Ecuador has implemented key strategies to fulfil \r\nsuch high humanitarian objectives and they deserve \r\nspecial mention. Those strategies allow the active \r\ninclusion of people in need of international protection \r\ninto Ecuadorian society, making Ecuador the country \r\nwith the largest number of refugees in the western \r\nhemisphere. \r\n Finally, and despite the enormous investment in \r\nhuman and economic resources for refugees, which has \r\ngone beyond the country’s possibilities, Ecuador has \r\nrenewed its commitment to the issue of refugees, the \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n3 08-60280 \r\n \r\nsame commitment that has been strengthened by the \r\nimplementation of our renewed policy on refugees. \r\n Everything I have said in this statement provides \r\nexamples of what my country and Government have \r\nimplemented for the effective promotion and \r\nimplementation of a culture of peace. Ecuador is truly \r\nconvinced that only by building a new multipolar order \r\nthat actively incorporates the economic and political \r\nregional blocks and by strengthening horizontal \r\nrelations, can a better, more just, democratic and \r\ndiverse world be built. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nChairman of the delegation of Belarus. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nBelarus welcomes the results of the World Conference \r\non Dialogue, which took place in Madrid in July 2008. \r\nWe agree with the principles of dialogue, tolerance and \r\nmutual understanding set forth in the final Declaration. \r\nBelarus particularly appreciates the idea in the Madrid \r\nDeclaration on the value of diversity in the culture of \r\npeoples and civilizations. \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, the President of \r\nBelarus proposed to recognize the diversity of ways to \r\nachieve progressive development as a value of \r\ncivilization. The purpose of the initiative was to \r\nsupport diversity of political, social and economic \r\nsystems in today’s world. Such diversity involves \r\nvarious ways of life for peoples, including religious \r\nand cultural aspects and historic legacies.  \r\n Diversity is certainly a value for world \r\ncivilization. It is the diversity of the political, \r\neconomic and social lives of peoples that is the \r\nprerequisite for effective dialogue, including a dialogue \r\nof cultures and religions. Supporting diverse ways of \r\nprogressive development is also one of the most \r\nimportant factors in maintaining international peace \r\nand security. We agree with the appeal in the Madrid \r\nDeclaration to encourage a dialogue of religions. For \r\nBelarus, the principles of interreligious and inter-ethnic \r\ntolerance, dialogue and cooperation have been an \r\nintegral element of social life.  \r\n The historical religious and ethnic diversity in \r\nBelarus has led to an absence of conflicts on the basis \r\nof religious or ethnic intolerance. The favourable \r\ninterreligious and interracial relations in Belarus are \r\nfostered by active State policy. We believe that the \r\nUnited Nations should broadly and decisively promote \r\nthe development of inter-ethnic and interreligious \r\ndialogue. We welcome the holding in the United \r\nNations of yearly forums on encouraging dialogue \r\namong cultures and religions as an effective \r\nmechanism for exchanging experiences. \r\n However, specific proposals that have been made \r\nin recent discussions in recent years have not yet been \r\nsufficiently reflected in decisions of the General \r\nAssembly, other bodies and specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations system. We believe it is important to \r\ncall upon the international community to assist in \r\nexpanding education as an effective means to combat \r\nreligious and racial intolerance; to enhance the \r\ninnovative use of the latest information technologies \r\nfor interreligious and inter-ethnic dialogue, especially \r\namong young people; to ensure political correctness in \r\nthe media and their moral and ethical responsibility in \r\nthe context of freedom of speech and also to expand \r\nacademic exchange among countries. Belarus proposes \r\nthat we consistently include these ideas in decisions of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica. \r\n Mr. Weisleder (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCosta Rica wishes to express its thanks to King \r\nAbdullah Bin Abdelaziz Al Saud of the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia for his endeavours to bring about this \r\nmeeting in the context of the dialogue among \r\ncivilizations promoted by Spain and Turkey.  \r\n A country such as ours, which on 1 December \r\nwill celebrate 60 years since we constitutionally and \r\ninstitutionally abolished our army, must welcome all \r\nefforts intended to achieve and promote peace. Here, it \r\nis worth recalling what Pope John Paul II stated with \r\nintellectual and spiritual clarity at the thirty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO): in today’s \r\nworld, development is the new name for peace.  \r\n For its part, the United Nations, as the broadest \r\nmost democratic and most inclusive organization of \r\npeoples and States, and faithful to its founding values, \r\nhas stated, by remit of heads of State or Government in \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), that the \r\nthree pillars of its mission are peace, development and \r\nrespect for human rights.  \r\n The Millennium Declaration tells us that those \r\npillars are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. It is of \r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 4 \r\n \r\ngreat symbolic significance that, in December, 60 years \r\nwill have passed since both the abolition of the army in \r\nour country and the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. If only human rights \r\nwere to prevail effectively and universally, how far we \r\nwould have progressed towards a culture of peace.  \r\n Accordingly, there are two fundamental elements \r\nif we are to conceive, develop and disseminate a \r\nculture of peace. On the one hand, we must live in \r\npeace — in peace with our neighbour and with \r\nourselves, deeply respecting the essential in all human \r\nbeings, each of whom possesses inherent dignity. On \r\nthe other hand, we must ensure that access to education \r\nis a true, effective and universal right.  \r\n Education, both in the home and at school, must \r\nconvey respect for others: for their religions, cultures, \r\nphysical and mental states and any other human or \r\nsocial attribute. The values about which we are talking \r\ntoday and which we are promoting must be the \r\ncornerstone of the educational materials used by our \r\nchildren and young people. Our Governments must \r\nensure that no book, tape or education material of any \r\nsort contains concepts or ideas fostering \r\ndiscrimination, indifference, hate or violence against \r\nany human group. \r\n It is undeniable that we are living in difficult \r\ntimes. While men and women of goodwill throughout \r\nthe world praise peace and live in peace, weapons and \r\npetty or lofty ambitions fill our fields with blood when \r\nthey should be planted with seeds and irrigated with \r\nwater so that the natural world that God gave us may \r\noffer the rich fruit of the Earth that feeds all of us. \r\nWhile men and women of goodwill yearn for a \r\nsolidarity that would organize and protect humanity, \r\ngreed and selfishness are rampant. While people of \r\ngoodwill work to bring close those who have been cast \r\naside or considered to be without importance, \r\nignorance or poorly understood tradition nevertheless \r\nkeeps them afar and under domination.  \r\n However, against this backdrop, allow me here to \r\nrecall the old adage that it is always darkest before the \r\ndawn. How much truth there is in that phrase. At a time \r\nwhen we are in the midst of wars, natural disasters and \r\neconomic events that worry all of us, the prophetic \r\nvision and the dream of Martin Luther King, Jr., are \r\never more real. The power of his idealism and the \r\npower of change must overturn prejudice and mental \r\nbarriers that, a short time ago, appeared invincible. \r\nMartin Luther King and his ideals have reached the \r\npromised land. The culture of respect for diversity as \r\nthe foundation of peace has taken a great leap forward.  \r\n From my country, Costa Rica, where, whenever \r\nwe sing our national anthem, we say “Long live work \r\nand peace”, we raise our voice in this Hall to proclaim \r\ntogether with the prophet Isaiah that swords shall be \r\nbeaten into ploughshares and that men shall learn war \r\nno more.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nChairman of the delegation of Croatia. \r\n Mr. Jurica (Croatia): Let me start by expressing \r\nmy sincere appreciation to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for organizing this high-level meeting and to \r\nHis Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia for having \r\nundertaken this initiative. We have had the chance \r\nduring the past two days to listen to heads of State or \r\nGovernment from the many diverse regions of the \r\nworld, and we have heard them place a great deal of \r\nimportance on the value of mutual dialogue and \r\nunderstanding. Their strong commitment to the \r\npromotion of these values can give rise to a future \r\nfilled with promise and hope. \r\n Today we live in a world that is closely linked \r\nthrough telecommunications and the global economy. \r\nWe do not need to live close to one another to know \r\nthat somewhere else in the world a different culture or \r\nreligion or system of beliefs exists. As our citizens \r\ninteract, our economies and our cultures also interact. \r\nIn this interaction, mutual understanding of one \r\nanother’s faith and culture is the basis for our well-\r\nbeing, our stability and our prosperity. \r\n On the other hand, it would be wrong for any \r\nreligion to claim superiority over others in terms of \r\nholding the highest truth. If we fail to understand and \r\nappreciate one another’s differences, religion and \r\nculture will eventually be used to promote and deepen \r\nconflicts, instead of bringing us closer together. The \r\nfreedom to hold a belief of one’s choosing, or to \r\nchange it, is an essential attribute of the human \r\nconscience and a prerequisite for peaceful coexistence \r\nand unity as one single but diverse human family. \r\n As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, it is crucial to \r\nensure that every single person has freedom of speech \r\nand expression and freedom of faith and belief, which \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n5 08-60280 \r\n \r\nincludes freedom of religion. That, in its ultimate form, \r\nis the basis for intercultural dialogue. \r\n With its geographical position, Croatia has been \r\nat the crossroads of various religions and cultures for \r\ncenturies. It is a place where Central and Eastern \r\nEurope meet the Mediterranean and where Christianity \r\nmeets Islam and Judaism, the cradle of our belief in \r\none God and creator. Croatia is a strong supporter of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations initiative, which is aimed \r\nat combating extremism and overcoming cultural \r\nmisunderstandings among civilizations. Croatia has \r\nactively engaged in that process and is about to begin \r\npreparing for its national plan on the issue.  \r\n Croatia welcomes the idea behind the World \r\nConference on Dialogue, held this year in Madrid, \r\nSpain, which brought together representatives of \r\nvarious religions in the hope that it would promote \r\nmutual understanding and tolerance. We would also \r\nlike to draw attention to the recent meeting in Rome \r\nbetween Catholics and Muslims, at which a number of \r\ntimely and pertinent issues were discussed. Such \r\nmeetings are good examples of bridging the differences \r\namong cultures and religions where a common \r\ndenominator can be found. \r\n Religious communities and their leaders hold a \r\ngreat deal of power and responsibility in their hands. \r\nBelievers listen to the words of such leaders and seek \r\ntheir guidance, especially at this time of change and \r\nchallenges. The important responsibility of promoting \r\nmutual understanding and tolerance that rests with \r\nreligious leaders provides them with a unique moral \r\nauthority to guide people in the direction of accepting \r\ntheir neighbours and rejecting distorted uses of religion \r\nthat exacerbate conflicts and tensions. \r\n In many regions of the world, we see that \r\ninterreligious and intercultural cooperation is a \r\nprerequisite for international peace and security. As a \r\ncountry rich in cultural diversity, we understand that a \r\ncommon and peaceful future for the benefit of all can \r\nbe built only on the foundations of tolerance, \r\nunderstanding and reconciliation. We should all strive \r\nto accept our differences and use them as a bridge by \r\nwhich to bring nations and peoples together and build \r\nthe conditions for a peaceful solution to long-lasting \r\nconflicts, rather than exacerbating dissimilarities \r\ncreated by historical or cultural differences or \r\nmisgivings. \r\n Although no one can change the past, we can all \r\ncommit to strengthening our future prospects by \r\ninvesting in new generations. Our children were not \r\nborn with prejudice in their hearts; they were taught it. \r\nIf we offer them interfaith education based on the \r\nprinciple of mutual understanding and acceptance, they \r\nwill grow up with a better chance to shape a world free \r\nof discrimination and intolerance. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nChairman of the delegation of Sri Lanka. \r\n Mr. Palihakkara (Sri Lanka): The delegation of \r\nSri Lanka commends the President of the General \r\nAssembly and His Majesty King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia for the initiative to \r\nconvene this high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the subject “Culture of peace”. The world \r\ncommunity is confronted with multiple crises that \r\ntouch upon human and inter-State behaviour in all its \r\naspects, heightening tensions, uncertainty and even \r\nfear and anxiety. It is indeed timely to reflect on the \r\nneed to understand and deal with the scourges of \r\nextremism, terrorism, hatred and xenophobic \r\ntendencies that lie at the root of those problems.  \r\n Initiatives on the dialogue among civilizations, \r\nthe dialogue among faiths and the dialogue among \r\npeoples and communities are not new; they have been \r\nand remain an integral part of the human endeavour \r\naimed at overcoming conflict and intolerance. About a \r\ndecade ago, when theories regarding an imminent clash \r\nof civilizations were being propounded by some, there \r\nwere wise initiatives in Asia to promote a dialogue \r\namong civilizations. That process has come a long way. \r\nIt has been heartening to see its further evolution \r\nthrough high-level meetings that have been held at \r\nimportant venues in places ranging from Madrid to \r\nPhnom Penh and from Tehran to Astana, covering \r\nalmost all corners of the world and now coming to \r\nfruition here at the United Nations in New York. \r\n All those initiatives have been timely in a world \r\nbeset by words and deeds of bigotry. The present \r\ndialogue can deepen mutual understanding and enable \r\nus to develop shared perspectives on common \r\nchallenges affecting humanity and a vision for a \r\ncollective response to such challenges, rooted in values \r\nand ethics. \r\n A culture of peace should not be a rhetorical \r\nexercise or a matter of precept alone, nor is it a debate \r\non values versus human rights or vice versa. It is self-\r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 6 \r\n \r\nevident that a culture of peace is the core value \r\nunderpinning all major religions of the world.  \r\n Moreover, the crises of the past and present \r\nnotwithstanding, we live in an era in which examples \r\nof great men and women who have nurtured, practiced \r\nand given meaning to the concept of non-violence, \r\ntolerance and passive resistance, without resort to \r\nterror and without harm to fellow human beings, have \r\nbecome more relevant than ever before. Mahatma \r\nGandhi, Martin Luther King and the living legend \r\nNelson Mandela are but a few of those who continue to \r\nbe icons of peace and reconciliation. Their missions \r\nand lives have drawn more on the inner strength of \r\nbeing human, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that \r\nintolerance and terrorism have no place in any human \r\nendeavour to overcome oppression, denial or \r\ndeprivation. Even today, there are a countless number \r\nof persons still out there who are practicing those \r\nethics, providing best-practices approaches to \r\npeacebuilding and conflict resolution. As we invest \r\ntime, resources and energy in forums such as this, it is \r\nalso timely that we take a leaf from their lives as we \r\nreflect on the important aspect of advancing a culture \r\nof peace at all levels. \r\n We live in an increasingly fragile and polarized \r\nworld. Underdevelopment, poverty and a multiplicity \r\nof social and economic ills, compounded by hatred, \r\nterrorism and the defamation of religions and cultures, \r\nas well as unsustainable consumption and exploitation, \r\ncontinue to beset humanity. Environmental \r\ndegradation, the erosion of ethical values, the \r\ncontinued weaponization of human security — \r\nincluding, of course, the menace of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction — and organized crime continue to push \r\nthe world towards further instability and crisis. While \r\nhuman ingenuity has heralded breathtaking \r\ndevelopments in science and technology, the benefits \r\nof such creativity are increasingly being outweighed by \r\nthe potential for misdirection and exploitation that they \r\nhave entailed.  \r\n By definition, a culture of peace includes much \r\nmore than just peace and security, which we often talk \r\nabout. It encompasses the gamut of positive attributes \r\nneeded to replace the culture of weapons and violence, \r\nmisery and repression that has dominated the human \r\nhistory. These include respecting life, rejecting \r\nterrorism and violence, sharing with others, listening in \r\norder to understand, preserving the planet, \r\nrediscovering solidarity and participating in \r\ndemocracy. There are yet more, which relate both to \r\nour way of life and to our relationships with fellow \r\nhuman beings. Compassion, not hatred, and informed \r\ninquiry, not blind adherence — as advocated in \r\nBuddhism — are key strands that run through the \r\nconcept of a culture of peace. \r\n A culture of peace presupposes realizing equity \r\nand equality for all, with justice and dignity. An \r\nabsence of these would naturally negate any effort at \r\nachieving a global order conducive to stability and \r\nprosperity. A comprehensive approach to enhancing a \r\nculture of peace, therefore, remains predicated on a \r\nlasting commitment and the will to take meaningful \r\nmeasures on multiple fronts, essential to securing \r\nhumanity. \r\n First, we should place emphasis on the imperative \r\nof peaceful coexistence. At the same time, positive \r\nrecognition of differences in the ways of life and the \r\nexpressions of ideas, as well as the pursuit of beliefs, is \r\nof equal importance. We should both strengthen and \r\nexpand the platform for dialogue. It is unfortunate that \r\ndialogue is often confused with argument, and \r\nconsequently, an overemphasis on argument culture has \r\novershadowed the importance of a culture of dialogue. \r\nThis is true of many peacemaking efforts, whether \r\ninter-State or intra-State. We need to reverse that trend. \r\n A positive affirmation that no religion, \r\ncommunity, or ethnicity can be equated or associated \r\nwith violence or terrorism is crucial to sustainable \r\npeace. Equally, no entity postulating or practicing \r\nterrorism can or should be allowed to claim to \r\nrepresent any community, ethnic or religious interests. \r\n It is important to address vulnerabilities, \r\ncompounded by backwardness, social and economic \r\nexclusions, if necessary even by upholding the value of \r\naffirmative action. It is also imperative that we take \r\nconscious and determined action to humanize our \r\nthoughts and conduct more. We witness, on a daily \r\nbasis, the media and others describing ordinary events \r\nin militaristic terms. It is unfortunate that we continue \r\nto apply the dichotomy of combatants versus non-\r\ncombatants to civilians, whereas the distinction should \r\nin fact be civilians versus non-civilians. The \r\nintroduction of the term “collateral” into the lexicon of \r\nhuman relations is one of the most negative \r\ndevelopments in recent years. It is time that we, and \r\nyounger generations, were weaned away from such \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n7 08-60280 \r\n \r\nthinking. Only terrorist groups would benefit from \r\nsuch weaponized thought processes. \r\n Last but not least, we should build on the positive \r\naspects of our different value systems and belief \r\nsystems in order to harness a greater understanding and \r\nrapprochement. The media, like other actors and \r\nplayers, need to play a catalytic role in this context. It \r\nis time to desist from the promotion of conflict and the \r\nglorification of terrorism and rededicate ourselves to \r\nactively strengthening the foundation for \r\nmulticulturalism and coexistence. \r\n As a country where the four major religions of \r\nBuddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam have \r\ncoexisted for centuries in peace and harmony, Sri \r\nLanka shares an intrinsic belief in the value and \r\nimportance of a sustained dialogue among civilizations \r\nand cultures, as well as interreligious and intercultural \r\ncooperation for peace. That spirit and ethic of \r\ncoexistence and mutual respect have been the bedrock \r\nof our 2,500 year-old civilization, founded on the core \r\nBuddhist values of compassion, understanding, modest \r\nliving and friendliness towards nature. Buddhism and \r\nother religions have immense potential and scope to \r\nplay crucial roles as religions of peace in culture of \r\npeace initiatives. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nChairman of the delegation of Bolivia. \r\n Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe are gathered here today to consider agenda item 45, \r\nentitled “Culture of peace”, to think together of ways \r\nto strengthen dialogue among our various religions and \r\nof ways of achieving an alliance among our \r\ncivilizations. \r\n We are living through times of crisis and change. \r\nThis consideration and search for unity among peoples \r\nhas become of paramount importance in these turbulent \r\ntimes, these times of crisis and major challenges, times \r\nin which we are becoming aware that our world is on \r\nthe brink of inevitable disaster, of global crisis, a world \r\nemergency that could be described in the following \r\nways. First, climate change is causing ever stronger \r\nand more frequent disturbances and natural disasters. If \r\ncertain critical thresholds are passed, there could \r\nsuddenly be disastrous consequences, especially for the \r\npoorest nations and peoples. \r\n Second, the depletion of the planet’s natural \r\nresources, which are being drastically sapped owing to \r\nover-exploitation by industrialized nations, which \r\nevery year consume 30 per cent more of the world’s \r\nnatural resources than can be renewed. \r\n Third, we have a water crisis. With urbanization, \r\nindustrialization and increased use of energy, there has \r\nbeen a greater consumption of water, and water tables \r\nhave been drawn upon to a greater degree, thus \r\nreducing the sources of this vital liquid in many areas \r\nof the world. \r\n Fourth, the current crises in food production have \r\nresulted from climate change, speculation and the \r\nincreasing conversion of agricultural produce into raw \r\nmaterials for agro-fuels. This is causing a drastic price \r\nhike and is gradually reducing world reserves. \r\n Fifth, an energy crisis has arisen with the end of \r\nthe era of cheap energy, above all, oil and gas — and \r\nyet, no alternative forms of energy have been found to \r\nreplace them at the current levels of consumption. \r\nNeither are there energy models that could contribute \r\nto reducing consumption. We continue to see natural \r\nresources being pillaged. \r\n Sixth, the current financial crisis has been \r\nspreading throughout the world in 2008 and has \r\ndeepened the asymmetries between countries, \r\nburdening peoples with the responsibility of saving the \r\nsystem at the cost of seeing their rights eroded and \r\nunemployment increasing. \r\n Seventh, there is the crisis of time, in which the \r\ntime scale of industrial production clashes harshly with \r\nthe rhythm of life, leading to a tremendous collision \r\nbetween the rhythm of natural time cycles and the \r\nlinear time of history as measured by the clock. \r\n This multifaceted crisis is an expression of the \r\ncrisis of the capitalist system. As it worsens, it is \r\nbecoming a factor that is de-stabilizing international \r\nrelations. \r\n If the countries of the world do not reach \r\nagreement on the necessary joint measures to resolve \r\nthe crisis, the culmination of the effects of climate \r\nchange in the world and depleted natural resources will \r\nmean that it will be more likely that many politicians \r\nwill favour the military option. They would do so in an \r\nattempt to hold on to their privileged living standards \r\nfor longer and maintain their control over access to oil \r\ndeposits and strategic routes for the transport of \r\nhydrocarbons, but also over access to drinking water, \r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 8 \r\n \r\nimportant mineral deposits, forests and land for food \r\nand biofuels, among other natural resources.  \r\n This global systemic crisis derives from a \r\nresurgence of racism as a tool of powerful groups and \r\nelites to entrench their privileges and to see in the \r\nothers — those different from them, the ones they have \r\ncolonized — a threat to their ability to continue to \r\nenjoy their accustomed lifestyle. In several countries \r\nand regions, racism has gone from speech to action and \r\nis expressed in violent acts against indigenous cultures, \r\nmigrants and peoples of the South. Sometimes, this is \r\nsubtly expressed through policies and control \r\nmechanisms in certain States.  \r\n Faced with this worrying perspective of the \r\ngrowing global crisis, the culture of life and peace has \r\nblossomed, a culture that is embodied by indigenous \r\npeoples, as has been demonstrated throughout history, \r\nand that is now gaining strength as an alternative to the \r\nunquestioned prevailing system. Our communities are \r\nfostering another, more balanced form of life and the \r\nconstruction of another Abya Yala — which is now \r\ncalled America — of another world.  \r\n We indigenous peoples wish to live not just \r\ntogether with other human beings but in harmony with \r\nMother Earth. Indigenous nations throughout the world \r\nare the reservoir of ancestral wisdom and scientific \r\nknowledge for protecting life. They are the moral \r\nreserve and a decisive factor for saving the world. We \r\nas human beings have to recognize that we are part of \r\nMother Nature and that we need to re-establish \r\ncomplementary relationships among ourselves and with \r\nnature. \r\n In that framework, everybody and everything are \r\nof importance in our culture. We all have a space. We \r\nare all worth something. We all maintain a balance \r\namong ourselves. That is to say, we all need one \r\nanother and we all belong to the culture of life. We are \r\nall a part of a community based on giving and \r\nreceiving, on living in complementarity with each \r\nother, on the common good, on organized mutual \r\nsupport and on life together, in which capacities are \r\ndeveloped without destroying human beings and \r\nnature. We are part of the Tama — the great family — \r\nwhich has always been present in the unity, \r\ncomplementarity, hearts and actions of indigenous \r\npeoples. \r\n To contribute to this international debate, our \r\nPresident, Evo Morales, has put forward ten proposals, \r\nten commandments to save the planet, humankind and \r\nlife. Among the most important proposals is the \r\nobligation to put an end to the capitalist system. If we \r\nwish to save Earth in order to save life and humankind, \r\nwe must put an end to the very essence of capitalism, \r\nwhich is the seeking of profit at the cost of life. The \r\nserious effects of climate change and of the energy, \r\nfood and financial crises are not a result of the actions \r\nof human beings in general, as is often explained. \r\nRather, they are products of the prevailing capitalist \r\nsystem, its production and consumption networks and \r\nits destructive and predatory logic, which has made \r\ncivilization inhuman, with unbridled industrial \r\ndevelopment eternally clashing with life.  \r\n Renouncing war is another inescapable task, \r\nbecause peoples do not win wars, only empires win \r\nwars. Nations do not win wars, only transnational \r\ncorporations win wars. Wars benefit small groups of \r\nthe powerful and not peoples. They destroy life and \r\npillage natural resources. Nothing and nobody can be \r\nsaved from war. Those who fight suffer and those who \r\ngo hungry to feed war suffer. Mother Earth and the \r\nnatural balance of life suffer. Above all, it is the human \r\ncondition and those rights that we have built up little \r\nby little, as nations, that suffer.  \r\n It is essential to build a world free of imperialism \r\nand colonialism, where relations must be aimed at \r\ncomplementarity, the respect for diverse sovereign \r\nentities and identities and where the deep asymmetries \r\nthat exist between one family and another, one country \r\nand another and one continent and another are taken \r\ninto account.  \r\n Throughout the world, blocs for regional \r\nintegration are being built. Those processes clearly \r\nshow that we wish to bring about coexistence among \r\nour various peoples, economies and civilizations, to put \r\nan end to the unipolar world and bring about a \r\nbalanced, multipolar one.  \r\n Another issue is how to put an end to wasting \r\nenergy. In 100 years, we have used up fossil fuels that \r\nwere created over millions of years. Some \r\nGovernments set aside land to produce energy for \r\nmachines and cars and not for human beings. We must \r\nimplement policies to curb the overproduction of \r\nbiofuels and, in this way, avoid hunger and poverty for \r\nour peoples.  \r\n We must become fully aware with regard to \r\nrespect for Mother Earth. The capitalist system treats \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n9 08-60280 \r\n \r\nher as a raw material, as a resource according to the \r\nsystem’s predatory logic. But Earth is our home and \r\ncannot be turned into merchandise.  \r\n In this time of climate chaos and resource \r\nscarcity on our finite planet, we must put an end to \r\nconsumerism, waste and luxury and consume only \r\nwhat is necessary. We must prioritize what we produce \r\nand consume locally, as well as exchanges among \r\nregions, thus stimulating self-sufficiency and the \r\nsovereignty of communities within the limits allowed \r\nby the health and resources of the planet. We must not \r\ngo beyond what the Earth can provide to shelter us. \r\n Industrialized nations must radically reorient \r\ntheir economies and readapt their production, \r\nconsumption and energy use levels. They must \r\nabandon the vision of unbridled economic growth, \r\nwhich is utopian and suicidal. They must reduce \r\nindustrialization and long-distance trade and promote \r\nlocal production and local agriculture, thereby \r\novercoming the imbalances among nations.  \r\n The major problems facing humankind and the \r\nplanet today are connected with the imbalances that \r\nhave been created among nations and regions. We \r\ncannot tackle the various crises we have mentioned if \r\nthese imbalances among countries persist. It is not a \r\nquestion of helping developing countries to achieve the \r\nsame level of development as developed countries. The \r\nliving arrangements in the North cannot be extended to \r\nthe entire planet, because there are not enough \r\nresources on Mother Earth to withstand such pillaging \r\nof natural resources. If we were all to live at the same \r\nlevel as developed countries, we would need three or \r\nfour more planets. This is unsustainable development.  \r\n Therefore, Bolivia talks of living well rather than \r\nof living better at the cost of others and nature. Living \r\nwell is based on the life of our peoples, the riches of \r\nour communities: fertile land, clean air and water and a \r\nsimple life, which can reduce our addiction to \r\nconsumption and ensure balanced production.  \r\n Living better is a concept that implies that certain \r\npeoples can live better than others. However, if we live \r\nbetter and see others who are worse off, that is not \r\nliving well. Exploiting and subjugating our neighbours \r\nor attacking nature might enable us to live better, but it \r\nis not living well. For us, living well means living in \r\ncommunity, being complementary one to another rather \r\nthan competitive, sharing and not taking advantage of \r\nour neighbours, living in harmony with others and with \r\nnature and being aware of the interdependence among \r\nnations and regions and the interdependence of human \r\nbeings with nature.  \r\n By awakening the ethical and moral values of our \r\npeoples and cultures, we should build brotherhood \r\namong nations, to make this new millennium a \r\nmillennium of life, and not of death or war, a \r\nmillennium of balance and complementarity. We, the \r\nnations of the world, must together decide on and \r\ndirect our destinies. We must all, men and women, \r\nconstruct a culture of patience, of dialogue and, \r\nfundamentally, of life and peace. Together, we must \r\nbring about respect and harmonious and peaceful \r\ncomplementarity among our nations and communities.  \r\n Finally, we firmly believe that we can neither \r\nresolve nor satisfactorily address all the crises \r\nbesetting us today unless we undertake discussions and \r\nprofound reflection, here in the United Nations, on the \r\nnew paradigms that must guide us in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United Republic of Tanzania. \r\n Mrs. Kafanabo (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nThe delegation of Tanzania is pleased to participate in \r\nthis important debate on the promotion of interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue, understanding and \r\ncooperation for peace, under the agenda item on the \r\nculture of peace. This high-level meeting has come at \r\nan opportune time, when the rejection of intolerance \r\nand a profound aspiration to live in peace and security \r\nare becoming an increasingly salient feature of society \r\ntoday. \r\n We congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for \r\nsuccessfully organizing this high-level meeting. We \r\nbelieve that its outcome will contribute to a better \r\nunderstanding and a deepening dialogue among \r\ncultures, religions and faiths. All of us therefore have \r\nan obligation to maintain the momentum that will be \r\ngenerated through this meeting. \r\n We also wish at this juncture to commend the \r\nwork undertaken by UNESCO and other United \r\nNations agencies, the Alliance of Civilizations and the \r\nTripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace in \r\npromoting the culture of peace. \r\n The importance of intercultural and interreligious \r\nharmony cannot be underscored sufficiently in the \r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 10 \r\n \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, a country with a diverse \r\npopulation. We have over 100 ethnic tribes and several \r\nreligions, which coexist in harmony and with full \r\nfreedom to express their cultural and religious \r\ndiversities. In Tanzania we have succeeded in having \r\nfour peaceful transitions of the presidency. The union \r\nof the Tanzania mainland and the island of Zanzibar \r\n44 years ago, has stood the test of time and is an \r\nexemplary case of unity of sovereign countries.  \r\n The Government of Tanzania firmly believes in \r\nfostering a culture of peace for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the prosperity of all people. The \r\nculture of peace and the unity that we enjoy in \r\nTanzania has not come about by itself; it has been \r\ndeveloped and nurtured. We have consistently instilled \r\nin our children and our people the values of tolerance \r\nand dialogue. We have further continued to impress \r\nupon them the need to refrain from the use of force and \r\nviolence and instead to reason with and respect each \r\nother, for we know that the costs of conflicts are \r\ndevastating. \r\n The freedom of religious belief, worship and \r\npractice is enshrined in our Constitution. However, we \r\ngo beyond the expression and protection of the right to \r\nfaith and worship and encourage dialogue between \r\nvarious faiths and religions to help to develop the \r\nunderstanding of the faiths and religious beliefs of \r\nothers and to reduce ignorance. Mutual understanding \r\nbreeds respect for each other, while ignorance is the \r\nseed of religious bigotry and intolerance and can be \r\nused by a few disillusioned people to sow seeds of \r\nmisunderstanding and discord in society. \r\n The responsibility for instilling the culture of \r\npeace is not the responsibility of the Government \r\nalone. Concerted efforts are needed from all \r\nstakeholders, such as parliaments and civil society, \r\nincluding religious and faith-based organizations. \r\n The Helsinki Process on Globalization and \r\nDemocracy, which Finland and Tanzania co-chaired, \r\nand its final report, which was presented to the \r\nSecretary-General in September 2008 by the Presidents \r\nof Tanzania and Finland, underscored that globalization \r\nhad brought changes with it, not only in world politics, \r\nbut also diversity in the people and cultures in many of \r\nour countries. In this regard, the involvement of \r\ndifferent stakeholders and international collaboration \r\nand cooperation are equally essential in meeting the \r\nobjectives of the Decade for the Culture of Peace. \r\n We are encouraged that one of the main goals of \r\nthe culture of peace is to ensure that the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations is adhered to and enhances the creation \r\nof a culture where peace will prevail. Tanzania, as one \r\nof the champions of peace in the African continent and \r\nbeyond, will continue to support the Decade for the \r\nCulture of Peace, the Alliance of Civilizations and the \r\nTripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation. We should \r\nendeavour to ensure that the United Nations continues \r\nto play a leading role in these initiatives. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Nepal. \r\n Mr. Acharya (Nepal): I would like to express our \r\nsincere appreciation for the convening of this timely \r\nhigh-level meeting on the culture of peace. We \r\ncommend the initiative of His Majesty King Abdullah \r\nof Saudi Arabia for convening this meeting. The \r\npresence of so many world leaders here is a testimony \r\nof the collective commitment to the cause of an \r\nenduring culture of peace in the world, for bringing \r\nabout harmony and understanding among different \r\nreligions, cultures and civilizations. \r\n Peace is the highest calling and highest ideal of \r\nthe United Nations. It is among the most important \r\nobjectives of our Organization. The United Nations \r\nembraces the universally shared values and goals for \r\nthe culture of peace. In this context it is very important \r\nthat we take up the agenda of the culture of peace, \r\ndialogue and alliance among civilizations and religions \r\nto promote harmony, tolerance and fraternity among \r\nthe world’s various cultures, religions and civilizations. \r\n Nepal appreciates various initiatives on the issue \r\nof the culture of peace, alliance and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations and harmony among the world’s religions \r\nand cultures, including the decision to include the \r\nculture of peace on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly. The United Nations system can do a lot to \r\npromote interfaith dialogue and interface among \r\ncivilizations, bringing together Governments, religious \r\ninstitutions, civil society leaders and the media to act \r\ntogether in the interest of the culture of peace. \r\n The messages of peace and harmony resonate in \r\nevery culture, civilization and faith. Nepal is a cradle, a \r\nconfluence of various religions, cultures and \r\ncivilizations, with Hinduism, Buddhism and various \r\nnative religions observed by diverse ethnic groups and \r\nindigenous peoples. Nepal is a perfect example of \r\ntolerance and harmony among peoples who observe \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n11 08-60280 \r\n \r\nvarious religions and cultures. Although we have had \r\nour share of conflict and violence, which we are \r\nputting behind us through a nationally driven peace \r\nprocess, it is a fact that religious and cultural \r\ndifferences are not a source of conflict in the country. \r\n Today, Nepal has made remarkable progress \r\ntowards peace, democracy and development through \r\nour own creative peace process. The peaceful \r\nresolution of Nepal’s decade-long conflict reflects the \r\nimportance of the culture of peace. The people of \r\nNepal have arrived at the conclusion that all \r\ndisagreements will henceforth be resolved through \r\ndialogue, accommodation and the verdict of the people \r\nthrough democratic means. \r\n Nepal is the country of birth of Lord Buddha, the \r\nApostle of Peace and the Light of Asia. The teachings \r\nof Buddha include the ideals of peace, compassion, \r\nnon-violence and tolerance, which are among the \r\nguiding principles of the United Nations. In that \r\ncontext, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to \r\nthe Secretary-General for his homage to Lumbini, the \r\nsacred birthplace of Buddha, during his recent visit to \r\nNepal. I would like to take this opportunity to state that \r\nwe are committed to developing Lumbini into a city of \r\nworld peace. The United Nations, which was \r\nsignificantly involved in the Lumbini development \r\nmaster plan, can play a significant role in the \r\ndevelopment of Lumbini as a fountain of world peace, \r\nwhich will greatly contribute to the culture of peace in \r\nthe world. \r\n Peace cannot develop in a vacuum, especially \r\nwhen people are forced to live in abject poverty, in the \r\nface of so much prosperity in the world. The \r\ninternational community should therefore invest further \r\nin sustainable economic and social development, so \r\nthat the world’s increasing population will not have to \r\nresort to deadly competition over shrinking resources. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that respect for human \r\nrights and the diversity of cultures, religions and \r\ncivilizations and the promotion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment should be at the core of the activities of \r\nthe United Nations to promote a culture of peace in the \r\nworld. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Argentina. \r\n Mr. Argüello (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation would also like to express its gratitude for \r\nthe initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to hold \r\nthis high-level meeting. I should also like to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for agreeing to hold \r\ntoday’s meeting.  \r\n Argentina believes fully in the important role \r\nplayed by the United Nations in bringing together \r\npeoples of different cultures and religions. In that \r\nconnection, we welcome the holding of the Madrid \r\nWorld Conference on Dialogue and the Declaration it \r\nadopted as a significant contribution to that noble \r\nobjective. \r\n We would also like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his efforts to bring about the culture of \r\npeace and genuine dialogue among peoples, cultures \r\nand religions and to implement resolution 62/90, in \r\nwhich the General Assembly affirmed that mutual \r\nunderstanding and interreligious dialogue constituted \r\nimportant dimensions of the dialogue among \r\ncivilizations and the culture of peace.  \r\n Through its various agencies, the United Nations \r\nhas carried out a series of efforts — albeit utilizing \r\nemphatically different approaches and mandates — to \r\npromote and implement the Programme of Action on a \r\nCulture of Peace, which was adopted by the General \r\nAssembly in September 1999. In that connection, it is \r\nworth mentioning the work done by UNESCO, which \r\nincluded cultural and other efforts focused on the \r\nreligious aspect of international dialogue. Among \r\nadditional initiatives, I should like to refer in particular \r\nto the Alliance of Civilizations, an effort to which the \r\nArgentine Republic has given its utmost support since \r\nit was launched in 2004 on the initiative of the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain with the support \r\nof Turkey. \r\n In line with the report of the High-level Group \r\nfor the Alliance of Civilizations and its plan of action, \r\nallow me to recall that Argentina has promoted the \r\ndissemination and strengthening of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations in the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nregion. In that regard, Argentina organized a regional \r\nseminar on the theme “Women and the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations: opportunities and challenges”, which \r\nwas held in Buenos Aires on 28 and 29 April 2008 and \r\nincluded the participation of governmental experts and \r\ncivil society representatives from every Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean country.  \r\n Such a committed effort as the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations could not ignore gender issues and the \r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 12 \r\n \r\nstatus of women throughout the world, in which \r\nwomen suffer scandalous inequalities and various \r\nforms of discrimination. On several occasions, we have \r\nreiterated that the report of the High-level Group, \r\nwhich was appointed by the Secretary-General, has \r\nitself drawn attention to disturbing facts including, for \r\nexample, that 70 per cent of children who do not attend \r\nschool are girls and that no less than two thirds of the \r\nworld’s illiterate people are women or children. Thus, \r\ninequality, discrimination and marginalization as \r\nregards women are therefore indisputable facts that \r\nhave a direct impact on how we view the other, as well \r\nas on the possibility of a genuine and constructive \r\ndialogue among societies and cultures.  \r\n The statements, conclusions and recommendations \r\nof the Buenos Aires seminar have been compiled in a \r\nbook entitled Women and the Alliance of Civilizations: \r\nOpportunities and Challenges, which was launched and \r\ndistributed on the occasion of the last ministerial \r\nmeeting of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. The book was later sent to every \r\ndelegation of the Organization’s Member States. \r\n It was especially enlightening to realize that there \r\ncould potentially be analogous situations between acts \r\nof intolerance in the Middle East and certain situations \r\nin Central America stemming from the phenomena of \r\ncolonization and, subsequently, immigration, which \r\nhave marked the history of our continent. That \r\nexperience is an especially interesting aspect of a \r\nregion such as Latin America and the Caribbean, where \r\nmajor migratory flows have historically converged to \r\ntransplant hopes and dreams in places of destination. \r\nInevitably, however, the same prejudices that existed \r\nwhere those flows originated were also brought to our \r\nregion. Those issues were the subject of debate at the \r\nregional seminar held in Buenos Aires. We hope that \r\nthe work begun there will continue to be developed in \r\nthe coming years. \r\n In conclusion, Argentina will continue to play an \r\nactive role in promoting and expanding dialogue and \r\nunderstanding among societies and cultures in the \r\nvarious regional and international forums in which we \r\nparticipate, especially as regards the lofty goals of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations.  \r\n Lastly, we believe that all countries that share \r\nthose ideals have difficult work ahead, including a very \r\nreal agenda to implement. I assure the Assembly that \r\nArgentina will spare no effort and will continue to \r\nparticipate actively in that noble task. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nchairman of the delegation of Cameroon. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): We note with appreciation the report of the \r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/63/262, as \r\nwell as his note contained in document A/63/127. We \r\nalso welcome the holding of this high-level debate \r\ndevoted to the interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\naimed at establishing a culture of peace. Among other \r\nthings, this year’s high-level debate is part of a \r\ntradition that has been taking root at the United \r\nNations for several years. \r\n As the Assembly is aware, Cameroon has always \r\nassociated itself with that tradition. Just to limit myself \r\nto the recent past, I note that my country was a sponsor \r\nof resolution 61/221, adopted in 2006, whereby the \r\nGeneral Assembly decided to hold in 2007 a high-level \r\ndialogue on cooperation among religions and cultures. \r\nMy country was also a sponsor of resolution 62/90, \r\nadopted in 2007, which affirmed that mutual \r\nunderstanding and dialogue among religions constitute \r\nimportant aspects of dialogue among civilizations and \r\nof a culture of peace.  \r\n As in the past, this high-level debate is fully \r\nrelevant. That is why this year, once again, we have \r\nbecome a sponsor of the two draft resolutions \r\n(A/63/L.23 and A/63/L.24/Rev.1) submitted under \r\nagenda item 45.  \r\n Today’s discussion is relevant because our world \r\ncontinues to pay a heavy price for the lack of \r\nunderstanding and absence of dialogue. Economic \r\nimbalances and, especially, intolerance and bigotry \r\ncontinue to cause untold suffering for peoples \r\nthroughout the world. Intolerance and bigotry are in \r\nfact phenomena that underlie, inter alia, the terrorism \r\nthat spares no continent. Intolerance is also the \r\nrejection of others, which underlies all the destructive \r\nfanaticism that we have seen throughout the world. \r\nThat is why serious thought and decisive action remain \r\nnecessary in this regard.  \r\n It must be said that the idea of a dialogue of \r\ncultures and religions is not in and of itself totally new. \r\nHowever, it should be acknowledged that the idea was \r\ngiven new life immediately following 11 September \r\n2001. Dumbstruck, the world found itself face to face \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n13 08-60280 \r\n \r\nwith the question of its existence and its future. \r\nAnalysts of all stripes, overtaken by the trap of \r\nurgency, thought that they had found all the answers in \r\nthe idea of a clash of civilizations. Attractive and \r\npowerful as a simplistic idea may be, this thesis held \r\nthat humankind had entered an era of conflict of a new \r\nkind. It was as if different civilizations, cultures and \r\nreligions could not agree on common principles and \r\nthat by their very nature they were destined to fight for \r\ndomination. \r\n Cameroon has mobilized all of its energy in order \r\nto promote a culture of peace, both within and without \r\nits borders. Internally, our slogan, “Peace, work and \r\nhomeland”, begins with the word “peace”, and that \r\nhighlights the importance that we attach to this \r\nessential value. \r\n My country, a true mosaic of peoples, cultures \r\nand religions, ensures respect for freedom of belief and \r\nreligion for all, representation and harmony among the \r\ncomponents of our population within institutions, and \r\nthe promotion of bilingualism and of Cameroonian \r\nlanguages and cultures. \r\n Twice, in 1985 and in 1995, Pope John Paul II \r\nvisited Cameroon. During his visits, people of all \r\nreligious faiths gathered together to enshrine the \r\nvirtues of peace, ecumenism, understanding and \r\nfraternity among all people. It is in that same spirit that \r\nthe Government and the people of Cameroon intend to \r\ngreet Pope Benedict XVI in March, during his first \r\nvisit to Africa. \r\n In terms of foreign relations, my country \r\neloquently demonstrates its commitment to a culture of \r\npeace through a policy of friendship, solidarity and \r\ngood-neighbourliness with the countries of the Central \r\nAfrican subregion, the continent of Africa and the rest \r\nof the world.  \r\n Regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes, as \r\nattested by the Bakassi dispute between Cameroon and \r\nits sister republic, Nigeria, which concluded \r\nsuccessfully, Cameroon is convinced that there is no \r\ncrisis pitting two States against each other, much less \r\nany internal crisis, that cannot be solved peacefully \r\nthrough the virtue of dialogue. In this regard, President \r\nPaul Biya stated in a message to the nation,  \r\n “The choice we have made in the Bakassi \r\ndispute — to see right prevail over might — has \r\nbeen found to be fully justified because we are a \r\npeople profoundly dedicated to peace, which we \r\nare endeavouring to preserve and without which \r\nthe progress and development to which our \r\npeoples rightly aspire would not be achievable.” \r\n This dedication of my country to the culture of \r\npeace is also reflected by our readiness to take part in \r\npeacekeeping operations initiated or sponsored by the \r\nUnited Nations or the African Union. This contribution \r\nalso involves training, for which my country has \r\ncreated, with donor support, a training school for \r\npeacekeeping and security.  \r\n Like all peace-loving nations, we believe that \r\npeoples throughout the world need a vision that \r\nhighlights the values of peace, tolerance and dialogue. \r\nThat vision should be embodied in several areas.  \r\n In terms of education, we should promote \r\nrecognition and respect for other people and their \r\ndifferences. In this regard, my country welcomes the \r\nintersectoral activities launched by UNESCO, and \r\nespecially the platform entitled “Contributing to the \r\ndialogue among civilizations and cultures and a culture \r\nof peace”, which is designed to encourage the updating \r\nof education and pedagogical materials to promote, in \r\nparticular among young people, respect for and \r\nrecognition of diversity of belief. We note with \r\nsatisfaction the cooperation between the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and UNESCO, and especially the signing \r\nin Madrid, in January 2008, of a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding providing for joint activities fostering \r\ndialogue and mutual understanding.  \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n In terms of information and communications, we \r\nshould use the media and new technologies to \r\nencourage the values of tolerance. From that \r\nstandpoint, my country welcomes the launching in \r\nFebruary 2008 by the Alliance of Civilizations of a \r\nmedia rapid reaction mechanism in support of the \r\nactivities of media professionals.  \r\n In an organization like the United Nations, a \r\nconstant culture of peace should be one of the decisive \r\nelements for the overarching common interests of \r\nhumankind. That is why we should maintain at the core \r\nof this culture the virtues of dialogue, tolerance, \r\nsolidarity, cooperation, respect and mutual esteem, \r\nunderstanding, harmony and a love for oneself and for \r\nothers.  \r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 14 \r\n \r\n Where there is no peace, we must together try to \r\nsow it, cultivate it and maintain it. Where we do have \r\npeace, we should together try to consolidate it, nurture \r\nit, cherish it and above all share it, for mutual benefit, \r\nbecause if we let it get away from us, it would be as if \r\nwe had decided to do without the air we breathe. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to the chairman of the delegation of Uganda. \r\n Mr. Butagira (Uganda): It is a great pleasure for \r\nme to address this important high-level meeting. I wish \r\nto thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this meeting. I wish to thank most sincerely \r\nthe Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty \r\nKing Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia \r\nfor initiating this meeting and his dedication and \r\ncontribution to the pursuit of interfaith dialogue and \r\nunderstanding.  \r\n When I look at God’s creation, I marvel at his \r\nwonderful architecture. From majestic mountains, \r\nvalleys, rolling hills, plains, glimmering sand, vibrant \r\nrain forests; whatever it may be, it is all beautiful \r\nscenery. Then I turn my thoughts to the living \r\ncreatures. I see tall people, short people, people of all \r\nshapes, people of all colours and hues. I see a variety \r\nof animals and bird species in their varied and \r\nbeautiful colours. Again, I marvel at the wonderful \r\narchitecture God created. Finally, I recall different \r\ncultures, faiths and religious beliefs and values. In \r\nshort, diversity is beautiful, as God so decreed.  \r\n Who are we then to disrupt that wonderful \r\nchemistry that God put in place? Those extremists who \r\ndistort religion for their own purposes and who kill in \r\nthe name of religion thinking they will go to heaven: \r\nthey will be disappointed when they find themselves in \r\nhell instead. Those people have rebelled against God’s \r\ncreation. We should strive to live in peace with one \r\nanother and to respect different cultures and faiths, for \r\nno faith is superior to another.  \r\n I was enthralled by what His Majesty King \r\nAbdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud said yesterday, at the \r\n46th meeting: “Religions, through which the Almighty \r\nGod sought to bring happiness to mankind should not \r\nbe instruments that cause misery.” \r\n This meeting is significant as it represents an \r\nopportunity for all faiths of the entire world \r\ncommunity to interact with a view to enhancing our \r\ncollective, peaceful coexistence and bonds of \r\nfriendship. It is also significant because of the \r\npreparations under way for the International Year for \r\nthe Rapprochement of Cultures in 2010 by the United \r\nNations system. We have witnessed in the recent past a \r\nnumber of commendable initiatives at the international \r\nlevel to promote interfaith dialogue. This meeting is \r\nunique because it is an unparalleled opportunity for us \r\nall to dialogue as people of different faiths and cultures \r\nunder the United Nations umbrella but with a common \r\ngoal and destiny. It is imperative that we use this \r\numbrella to engage in a very serious dialogue and that \r\nis why Uganda gives this initiative its full support. \r\nHowever, it is necessary that in all our endeavours a \r\ncoordinated effort be made to minimize the duplication \r\nof initiatives.  \r\n We in Uganda consider interfaith dialogue a \r\nnecessity and not an option. We know that all religions \r\nshare common foundations. They espouse equality, \r\npeace and tolerance. We should therefore spare no \r\neffort individually, nationally and at the global level to \r\nbecome more active in countering ignorance by \r\noffering positive information on interfaith beliefs. We \r\nshould dispel negative stereotypes and extremism. \r\nUganda is a country of multiple religious faiths where \r\npeople of different faiths live side by side in relative \r\nharmony. As a country, we have deliberately \r\nencouraged interfaith collaboration and partnership. \r\nThe experience has been exemplary and has generated \r\nconsensus among the different faith communities to \r\nwork together. It has resulted in true friendships and \r\nother opportunities to work together as a community. \r\nWe are committed to maintain and sustain that \r\nmomentum and are willing to share our experience and \r\nmake a positive contribution to this process. \r\n This meeting comes at a time of momentous \r\nevents and changes in the world. It comes one day after \r\nthe ninetieth anniversary of the end of the First World \r\nWar and at a time when our focus is on conflict \r\nprevention and resolution initiatives. It also comes at a \r\ntime when we are refocusing on human dignity, family \r\nvalues and development. Our faith should be a catalyst \r\nto bring us together as it has done today to reflect, \r\nunderstand and address these challenges. Together we \r\nmust do more to address the challenges of poverty, \r\nwidespread hunger, gender inequality, environmental \r\ndeterioration and the lack of education, health care and \r\nclean water. We should deal conclusively on actions to \r\nreduce debt and increase aid, trade and technology \r\ntransfer to those less fortunate.  \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n15 08-60280 \r\n \r\n We should also recognize that the range of human \r\ndevelopment in the world is vast and uneven, with \r\nastounding progress in some areas amid stagnation and \r\ndismal decline in others. As people of faith, we should \r\nrecognize that balance and stability in the world \r\nrequire the commitment of all nations, rich and poor, \r\nand a global development compact to extend the wealth \r\nof possibilities to all people. Our religious and moral \r\nvalues should inspire us to address the problems that \r\nface humanity. They should be our rallying call to deal \r\nwith the important issues of our time for peace and \r\ncooperation. We must commit resources towards this \r\nendeavour. \r\n This meeting underlines the crucial role faith can \r\nplay in enhancing peaceful coexistence, peace, \r\nharmony and prosperity for us all. It is our duty and \r\nmust be our pledge. Uganda supports this initiative and \r\nit is our commitment to work tirelessly for a peaceful \r\nand prosperous world. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n Mr. Bailly (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, who \r\nrequested that I convey to the Assembly his wishes for \r\nthe full success of this meeting, permit me to express \r\nour gratitude to you, Mr. President, for having \r\nconvened this high-level meeting. The Ivorian \r\ndelegation also takes this opportunity to convey to His \r\nMajesty King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of \r\nSaudi Arabia, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, the \r\nthanks of Mr. Youssouf Bakayoko, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Côte D’Ivoire, for having initiated this \r\nprocess, which challenges world leaders and religious \r\nleaders to urgently establish a genuine and frank \r\ndialogue among religions with a view to the further \r\npromotion of a culture of peace. Although he was \r\ninvited to participate in this important meeting, \r\nMinister Bakayoko was unable to travel to New York \r\nfor scheduling reasons.  \r\n Côte d’Ivoire celebrates a national peace holiday \r\non 15 November each year. We long ago incorporated \r\nthe values of peace and tolerance into our development \r\nprogrammes, our policy of national construction and \r\ncoexistence with neighbouring countries and our \r\nforeign policy. Thus, our country cannot remain on the \r\nsidelines of this historic meeting on the culture of \r\npeace. Côte d’Ivoire unreservedly supports the Saudi \r\ninitiative and United Nations efforts to establish a \r\npermanent framework for dialogue among religions \r\nand to adopt appropriate strategies to promote the \r\nimplementation of all the recommendations resulting \r\nfrom this meeting. \r\n Our country, like other nations whose \r\nrepresentatives have spoken before me, remains \r\nconvinced that the establishment of such a dialogue \r\nwould inevitably give rise to a new era in international \r\nrelations firmly based on an innovative vision of hope \r\nfor humankind. Indeed, there is an urgent need for the \r\nworld to transcend religious differences and to work \r\nresolutely towards a rapprochement of civilizations, \r\nrespecting the convictions and faiths of all. That is why \r\nour country fully endorses the two draft resolutions \r\nbefore the General Assembly on the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for \r\nthe Children of the World, 2001-2010 (A/63/L.23), and \r\non the promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace \r\n(A/63/L.24/Rev.1).  \r\n In that regard, we urge the Assembly to adopt \r\nboth draft resolutions in order to show our collective \r\ncommitment to this new process. Clearly, it will result \r\nin a platform for exchanges that will undoubtedly help \r\nto bridge the chasm of misunderstanding and \r\nresentment that exists between civilizations. With a \r\nstrong political and collective commitment, we must \r\npromote all the shared ethical and moral values \r\nadvocated by religions in their diversity. \r\n We believe that world leaders must, in addition to \r\ncurrent initiatives, go beyond mere wishful thinking to \r\nengage in religious dialogue in order to carry out \r\npolicies that will reduce or even destroy identity-based \r\nand ideological barriers that have long served as \r\npretexts for the perpetuation of systems of exploitation \r\nand oppression that have helped to divide the world \r\ninto blocs of mistrust.  \r\n Justification of the culture of profit and the \r\nprotection of some interests at the expense of others \r\nhave resulted in the demonization and subjugation of \r\nentire sectors of humankind in a context of extreme \r\ndespair and insecurity linked to the aggravation of \r\nextremism, fanaticism and intolerance and to the \r\ndecline of the moral and political principles that led to \r\nthe establishment of the United Nations immediately \r\nafter the Second World War. It is obvious that, \r\nultimately, this Manichaean vision of world affairs, \r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 16 \r\n \r\nwhich is linked to the supremacy of one religion over \r\nanother and of one race over another, as well as to the \r\npromotion of a single school of thought or model for \r\nsociety, can only be suicidal for humankind, which is \r\nrich in its pluralism.  \r\n The path of Côte d’Ivoire throughout its recent \r\nhistory shows how the adoption of the culture of peace \r\nas a pillar of development and an aspect of integration \r\nhas helped our country to overcome the danger of \r\nimplosion and not to succumb to ethnic and religious \r\nchaos in the economic crisis that it has been \r\nexperiencing for several years. Indeed, in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, as stated by the late President Félix \r\nHouphouët-Boigny, the founding father of our nation, \r\npeace is not an empty word; it is a behaviour. The Félix \r\nHouphouët-Boigny Peace Prize, awarded each year by \r\nUNESCO, emphasizes that support for the culture of \r\npeace is a dynamic approach to action.  \r\n It was on behalf of the culture of peace, which is \r\nat the centre of his governmental policy, that President \r\nGbagbo launched direct dialogue with the former \r\nIvorian rebels, leading to the Ouagadougou Political \r\nAgreement, which enabled us to reunify our country. \r\nIndeed, our national experience demonstrates that the \r\nworld can overcome division in order to build a new \r\nworld order based on partnership with a human face, \r\nanchored in human development and the correction of \r\nimbalances.  \r\n That is why we agree with those who firmly \r\nbelieve that the real challenge lies not in the \r\npredictable rhetoric of statements of intention, but \r\nrather in persuading the decision makers of this world \r\nto opt for a society that would place greater priority on \r\nthe moral dimension of managing world affairs, which \r\nwould help to help fulfil the purposes of the United \r\nNations as we celebrate the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nthe representative of the Comoros.  \r\n Mr. Oussein (Comoros) (spoke in French): At a \r\ntime when the world has been hit head-on by crises of \r\nall sorts related to finance, energy, food and identity, \r\nand when doubt, intolerance, mistrust, selfishness and \r\nisolationism have supplanted tolerance and fraternal \r\nsolidarity among peoples, the holding of this important \r\ndialogue among religions is more meaningful than \r\never. In that regard, I should like, on behalf of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, to thank His Majesty Abdullah \r\nBin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, Custodian of \r\nthe Two Holy Mosques, who has taken the welcome \r\ninitiative to promote the holding of a dialogue among \r\nreligions on several occasions.  \r\n We believe that to engage in dialogue with \r\nanother religion is to discover what it shares with us \r\nand to find ourselves in it. Thus, in addition to what \r\nmakes us different and separates us, there is a \r\ncommonality among believers that is deep and strong \r\nenough that they realize that they are similar and \r\nunited.  \r\n In a world that has become an increasingly \r\ninterdependent global village, our salvation lies in the \r\nawareness that nothing is really sustainable without the \r\nother. We must have respect for his or her faith, \r\nreligion and differences in the firm conviction that we \r\nare all links in the same chain. Our solidarity and \r\nsurvival depends on our common will to build a better \r\nworld, inspired by the spirit of justice, tolerance, \r\nsharing and fraternal solidarity. \r\n The Union of the Comoros, a Muslim nation \r\nknown for its legendary hospitality, has always been \r\nprofoundly dedicated to the daily practice of tolerance \r\nand respect for human dignity. It is firmly convinced \r\nthat human beings, as God’s creatures and with a \r\nmultiplicity of cultures and civilizations are a source of \r\nwealth and thus should not be a source of conflict. \r\n All religions and all humankind today are faced \r\nwith the challenges of all the drifting of an increasingly \r\ndehumanizing and unjust modern world. It must be \r\nacknowledged that the Muslim world is increasingly \r\nbecoming victim to the policy of double standards. We \r\nconsider that Islamophobia has become one of the great \r\nevils of our times since the end of the cold war and \r\n11 September. That is a result of injustice and \r\nignorance.  \r\n Interreligious dialogue can help to bring people \r\nto more understanding and, undoubtedly, do away with \r\nthe logic of the clash of civilizations. We endorse the \r\nthought of the late President Léopold Sédar Senghor, \r\nwho spoke of “enrichment of our differences to \r\nconverge towards the universal”. Learning to know \r\noneself in order to live together whatever the \r\ncircumstance is an essential step for enrichment of \r\ndifferences and for building a culture of peace.  \r\n Since all believers of all religions are called to be \r\ninstruments of love and harmony for all of humankind, \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n17 08-60280 \r\n \r\nthey must renounce all forms of oppression and \r\nterrorism, especially when such acts are committed in \r\nthe name of religion.  \r\n Finally, because there can be no peace without \r\ndevelopment, and convinced that no believer can \r\nremain indifferent to injustice and poverty, the Union \r\nof the Comoros, in the framework of this dialogue, \r\ncalls upon all believers to unite in order to relieve the \r\nhungry and to work together for a new, more just, more \r\ntransparent and more equitable world order, taking into \r\naccount the situation of the poorest and most \r\nimpoverished. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate. We shall now proceed to \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/63/L.24/Rev.1, \r\nentitled “Promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace”.  \r\n I should like to announce that since the \r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following \r\ncountries have expressed the wish to become sponsors: \r\nAfghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Brazil, China, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Grenada, \r\nHonduras, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Japan, \r\nMali, Paraguay, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\nthe draft resolution? \r\n  Draft resolution A/63/L.24/Rev.1 was adopted \r\n(resolution 63/22). \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving \r\nthe floor to the representative of the United States, who \r\nwishes to speak in explanation of position on the \r\nresolution just adopted, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of position are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. McMahan (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States was founded on the principle of freedom \r\nof religion. This freedom, enshrined in our \r\nConstitution, has nourished a rich diversity of religions \r\nthat have contributed greatly to the growth and vitality \r\nof our society for over 400 years. The Republic of the \r\nPhilippines has also enshrined the concept of freedom \r\nof religion in its Constitution and has been active in \r\npromoting the principle. We commend President \r\nArroyo for her efforts to promote and protect human \r\nrights in her region and around the world. \r\n As in past years, the text before us has much to \r\nrecommend it. It acknowledges the importance of \r\nreligious and cultural diversity and affirms that mutual \r\nunderstanding and dialogue are important for achieving \r\na true and lasting peace. It recognizes the importance \r\nof education, and it recognizes the vital role of the \r\nnews media, whose ability to work freely and \r\nobjectively is crucial to open and honest dialogue, even \r\nwhen the news they report is unpleasant or critical. \r\n Indeed, without the freedom for each and every \r\nindividual to express his or her opinions or beliefs, any \r\nattempt to promote dialogue, diversity and \r\nunderstanding rings hollow. The Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, the sixtieth anniversary of which we \r\nare celebrating this year, is clear. Article 19 reads:  \r\n “Everyone has the right to freedom of \r\nopinion and expression; this right includes \r\nfreedom to hold opinions without interference \r\nand to seek, receive and impart information and \r\nideas through any media and regardless of \r\nfrontiers.”  \r\n The United States affirms unequivocally that free \r\nexpression is the proper antidote for intolerance. \r\nWithout the freedom to share thoughts and opinions, \r\nwe cannot hope to break down the ignorance and \r\nmistrust that breeds violence. A widely cherished \r\nprinciple among Americans is that, while we may not \r\nalways agree with what someone might say, we will \r\nfight for their right to say it. We must honour that \r\nprinciple even if in some instances the words may be \r\noffensive. The remedy for offensive speech is more \r\nspeech and more dialogue and more understanding — \r\nnot less. \r\n For those reasons, the resolution before us must \r\nnot in any way be read to restrict peaceful expression \r\nof opinion or belief. The right of all people to think and \r\nexpress themselves freely and peacefully is the \r\nbirthright of all humanity. We cannot countenance \r\nefforts by some to roll back the fundamental freedom \r\nof expression. \r\n Let me be clear. Unfortunately, there are some \r\nGovernments that have misused, and will continue to \r\nmisuse, United Nations resolutions and declarations to \r\njustify imprisonment, torture and even death sentences \r\nfor those who offer interpretations of religion — or of \r\nA/63/PV.50  \r\n \r\n08-60280 18 \r\n \r\nproper governance — that differ from those of the \r\nGovernment in power. Sadly, that tendency is so \r\nwidely prevalent that many non-governmental \r\norganizations have begun tracking those cases, as has \r\nmy Government. \r\n We ask the members of this body to ensure that \r\nUnited Nations resolutions are not misused in that way \r\nand to hold accountable those Governments that seek \r\nto stain the United Nations by associating it with their \r\nacts of intolerance or brutality. Members of society \r\nmust be able to engage in the open exchange of views \r\nwithout fear of recrimination if we are to develop the \r\nunderstanding and trust necessary to get along and live \r\nwith one other. \r\n The President: We have heard the only speaker \r\nin explanation of position. \r\n As we come to the close of this remarkable \r\nmeeting, I am both heartened and astonished by the \r\noutpouring of appeals that we have heard over the past \r\ntwo days. I thank all participants for contributing to \r\nthis ongoing dialogue on the culture of peace.  \r\n This meeting has proved that while we do, \r\nobviously, have differences in our religions and \r\ntheologies, we are very much united in our essential \r\nvalues. Just as important, we must apply those values if \r\nwe are to survive the consequences of the converging \r\nman-made crises that we face at this critical historical \r\njuncture. \r\n Religions and theologies are necessarily rooted in \r\ncultures and are thus inevitably different. We should \r\ncelebrate and thank God for such diversity. While we \r\nmight agree that homogenization is good for milk, it is \r\nnot good for human cultures. We must defend the \r\ncultural identity of all peoples with the same \r\ndetermination with which we defend the biodiversity of \r\nour planet. \r\n At the level of values, whether faith-based or \r\nflowing from our rich ethical and philosophical \r\ntraditions, we see the hand of God. There are, however, \r\nvalues, or rather anti-values, that do not come from \r\nthose roots. They spring from the dominant culture that \r\nfoments hatred, intolerance, greed and social \r\nirresponsibility. \r\n His Majesty, our brother the King of Saudi Arabia \r\nand Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King \r\nAbdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, expressed that very \r\nclearly:  \r\n“Every tragedy suffered by the world today is but \r\na result of the abandonment of the noble \r\nprinciples enunciated by all religions and \r\ncultures. The roots of all global crises can be \r\nfound in human denial of the eternal principle of \r\njustice.” (A/63/PV.46) \r\n We have heard calls for restoring the values of \r\ncompassion and solidarity to the increasingly barren \r\nlandscape of political decision-making. Speakers from \r\nall corners of the Earth have insisted that we put people \r\nabove profit as the ultimate measure of success in the \r\nincreasingly heartless and bankrupt world of business. \r\n From our brother Shimon Peres, President of \r\nIsrael, we heard that we have abandoned our faith by \r\nopting for greed. He pointed out that, for us to change \r\nthe world, we must first change ourselves. I could not \r\nagree with him more. Referring to this meeting, he said \r\nthat it was capable of beginning a movement of great \r\nimportance to the world. \r\n We note the call by Mr. Gordon Brown, Prime \r\nMinister of the United Kingdom, to apply our values to \r\nensure that we be remembered as the generation that \r\nended illiteracy and reversed our negative impact on \r\nclimate change.  \r\n We have heard from those who adhere to no \r\nparticular faith, but bring messages of hope and love, \r\nfor surely the values that are central to our faiths can \r\nbe just as strongly felt and defended by those who are \r\nnot religious. \r\n We have heard urgent appeals to transcend our \r\nnarrow self-interests as nations, peoples, communities \r\nand individuals. We have heard the call to restore trust, \r\ncare and solidarity in our institutions. \r\n The message is very clear: Either we restore the \r\ntimeless values of brotherhood and sisterhood or we \r\nwill surely flounder in a morass of indifference and \r\nself-induced destruction, which will extend to the \r\nentire planet. \r\n We have come together in the midst of a \r\ngathering perfect storm, whose intensity and \r\ndestructiveness are forcing all of us to rethink the way \r\nthat we are conducting ourselves as human beings. We \r\nare aware that the storm is of our own making, and that \r\nit will take heroic measures to prevent it from \r\ndestroying our aspirations to economic, social and \r\nspiritual well-being, wherever we are in the world. \r\n A/63/PV.50\r\n \r\n19 08-60280 \r\n \r\n We have come together realizing that we must \r\ntake responsibility for the billions of people who are \r\nliving in inexcusable poverty and deprivation. Leaders \r\nhave referred to the innocent millions whose lives are \r\ntipping into crisis and poverty because of the \r\nirresponsibility and greed of people in far-off places. \r\nWe must change that with a sense of urgency. \r\n We have defined this moment as a turning point \r\nin human history, where courageous, even heroic \r\nleadership is needed. Let us draw on the reservoirs of \r\nlove and solidarity that we all possess. Let us be \r\ncourageous and heroic. I deeply believe we can. \r\n In his statement at the beginning of this meeting, \r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud \r\nsaid:  \r\n“Our dialogue, which will be conducted in a \r\ncivilized manner, should revive and consolidate  \r\n \r\nthose lofty ideals among peoples and nations. No \r\ndoubt, that will constitute a glorious triumph of \r\nwhat is most noble in human beings over what is \r\nmost evil in them, and will give humankind hope \r\nfor a future in which justice, security and a \r\ndignified life will prevail over injustice, fear and \r\npoverty.” (A/63/PV.46) \r\n This has been such a meeting. In a couple of \r\nweeks, at our meeting on financing for development in \r\nDoha, we will have a chance to show the world that we \r\nare, indeed, serious about making solidarity the guiding \r\nprinciple in our resolutions and in our actions. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 45. \r\nThe meeting rose at 8.10 p.m. \r\n"
