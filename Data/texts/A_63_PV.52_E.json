I would like to \r\nexpress my thanks for the opportunity to be here at the \r\nUnited Nations to share with the Assembly the process \r\nof change that we initiated in 2006 in the context of a \r\ndemocratic and cultural revolution seeking to achieve \r\nequality among Bolivian men and women.  \r\n I wish to recall briefly something that is known \r\nthroughout the world. I come from a background of \r\nsocial struggle and social movements, specifically the \r\nindigenous farmers’ movement. I remember clearly the \r\nmany peaceful demonstrations we held that were aimed \r\nat putting an end to injustice and inequality among my \r\ncountry’s most marginalized sectors, the indigenous \r\nmovement, the farmers’ movement and the original \r\nworkers’ movement. For almost 200 years, we were \r\nexcluded, marginalized and discriminated against in \r\nour republic. Our natural resources were pillaged. The \r\nindigenous farmers’ movement has therefore always \r\nsought to change the social structures. We have used \r\ndemocracy as a tool to change economic policies that \r\ndo not provide an answer to the economic and social \r\nconcerns of the majorities that make up the indigenous \r\nmovement.  \r\n I would briefly like to recall how we moved from \r\na union and communal struggle to an electoral one. \r\nAfter so many demonstrations and so many marches \r\nfrom Chapare, Cochabamba and Caracollo; after \r\nmarching for kilometres and kilometres and weeks and \r\nweeks to seek social justice, to seek equality from the \r\nGovernment in office and to seek that they heed the \r\ndemands of the peoples; and after signing many \r\nagreements, one after another, the time came when we \r\nasked: When are these agreements going to be \r\nimplemented?  \r\n After one of the most recent and largest \r\nmobilizations in 1994, the Government offered us \r\nsatisfactory agreements. We went back to our regions \r\nto celebrate with great joy. Weeks and months went by \r\nand nothing changed. The agreements were not \r\nimplemented. We therefore asked ourselves when those \r\nagreements entered into between the Government and \r\nunion leaders following those great marches would be \r\ncarried out.  \r\nA/63/PV.52  \r\n \r\n08-60539 2 \r\n \r\n We came to the conclusion that they would be \r\nimplemented when we had political power. What did \r\nwe have to do to become political leaders? How could \r\nwe create a political tool for liberation that could be \r\nused to defend national sovereignty, dignity and the \r\ngroups that had been so neglected throughout Bolivia’s \r\nhistory? To reiterate, those groups include indigenous \r\npeople and workers, as well, of course, as patriotic \r\nmembers of the middle class and intellectuals, all of \r\nwhom joined the first-ever political movement in the \r\ncountry’s history comprised of indigenous peasants.  \r\n We had organized a political movement that was \r\nnot created by political scientists, experts or \r\nintellectuals. That movement grew out of marches, \r\nmobilization and, especially the native peasant \r\nmovement, although some city-based groups also \r\njoined. We also told ourselves that if we wanted to \r\nbuild a political liberation movement, we first had to \r\nput an end to political serfdom. Sinecures were rife; in \r\nthe countryside, the various parties merely participated \r\nin election campaigns, but they never went to peasant \r\ncommunities.  \r\n As we began to build, the movement grew little \r\nby little. In the beginning, we could barely get a \r\nmember of Congress elected. In the second elections \r\nwe participated in, we elected four members to the \r\nnational Parliament. By the third elections, we \r\nsucceeded in winning 27 of the 130 seats in the \r\nChamber of Deputies.  \r\n The first time I participated in the National \r\nCongress, I was expelled for having said something \r\nimportant. I told members that they were only thinking \r\nof how much money they could make and how, while I \r\nnever saw them worrying about their towns, regions or \r\ndistricts. Based on what I believed and had seen, I \r\ncame to the conclusion that the Parliament was the \r\nsupreme mafia of the State. I had to pay a price for \r\nthat. Unfortunately, I was expelled. I left happy, \r\nhowever, without worries or bother, but we returned in \r\n2002 with 27 parliamentarians. In 2005, we won the \r\nelections. \r\n I say this to illustrate how we began at the bottom \r\nto build a new Bolivia that would be united and where \r\nthere would be equality and dignity. We now have the \r\nopportunity to achieve what we believed as union \r\nleaders in the Palacio, the Government and the State, \r\nand to keep our promise of equality, dignity, unity and \r\nrespect for our diversity. We are very diverse, both \r\nphysically and economically. Once in Government, we \r\nlaunched some very profound economic \r\ntransformations, including nationalizing our \r\nhydrocarbon resources. That has made it possible for \r\nus to address some needs by using the country’s own \r\neconomic resources.  \r\n Bolivia has suffered continual budget deficits \r\nsince the 1940s or 1950s and has never enjoyed a \r\nsurplus. That is a matter of record. In 2006, the first \r\nyear of my Government, thanks to nationalization, \r\nBolivia had a budget surplus. We have begun to grow \r\neconomically. For example, prior to the nationalization \r\nof natural resources, including hydrocarbons, Bolivia \r\nreceived barely $300 million of the $1.5 billion \r\ngenerated by hydrocarbon resources. Last year, we \r\nreceived $2 billion. That figure continues to grow. We \r\nhope that the price of a barrel of oil will not decrease \r\nfurther this year. If the price remains between $60 and \r\n$70, that natural resource will produce $2.5 billion for \r\nBolivia, accounting for nearly 50 per cent of our export \r\nearnings. Before I became President in 2005, Bolivia’s \r\nexport earnings amounted to barely $2.7 billion; by \r\nSeptember 2008, our exports were worth $6 billion. \r\nAnd we are a small country with many economic and \r\nsocial problems.  \r\n We have begun to address our social problems \r\nand needs gradually. Nevertheless, as we began to \r\nmake changes, groups emerged from various regions to \r\nchallenge and destabilize the Government and to \r\nlaunch attacks against our democracy, our way of life \r\nand even the export of gas.  \r\n I have asked the President of the General \r\nAssembly to allow me to speak today in order to \r\ninform representatives about how, through dialogue, \r\nwe have been able to resolve the confrontation between \r\nsmall opposition groups and the national Government \r\nand social movements. Some groups claim that they \r\nhave been trained to lead Bolivia and to dominate \r\nIndians and workers. They do not accept that a union \r\nleader could become President in order to turn Bolivia \r\ninto a democracy. \r\n As our armed forces did not acquiesce in the \r\nattempted coups d’etats, in September and October \r\nthose groups attempted a civil coup. They seized \r\nairports and State institutions in several departments \r\nand States. They disrupted gas exports to Argentina and \r\nBrazil. I recall, for instance, that when I was a union \r\nleader, I was accused of being a terrorist merely for \r\n A/63/PV.52\r\n \r\n3 08-60539 \r\n \r\nhaving marched in demonstrations. Yet those groups \r\nattempted to destroy democracy by taking over State \r\ninstitutions. I believe that they carried out genuine acts \r\nof terrorism, genocide, conspiracy and sedition.  \r\n I am here to thank this international forum for \r\nhaving defended democracy, the rule of law and truth \r\nin my country. Regrettably, however, I have another \r\ntruth to tell. The United States was the only country to \r\nfail to repudiate those acts of terrorism, sedition and \r\ngenocide. Others did, however. The United Nations, the \r\nUnion of South American Nations and the Organization \r\nof American States defended truth, democracy and the \r\nrule of law. \r\n We are in negotiations to determine how to reach \r\nagreement with those groups. I had little experience \r\nwith negotiations as a union leader, but as President I \r\nhave had to negotiate with opposition groups. It has \r\nbeen necessary to carry out those negotiations with \r\ntransparency, sincerity and honesty in order to bring \r\nour peoples together. In that connection, I should like \r\nto emphasize the solidarity and important role of the \r\nUnited Nations and the entire international community. \r\n During the dialogue between the Government and \r\nthe opposition, I asked for reasons. If we were wrong, \r\ntell us what we are wrong about. As they had no \r\nargument to make, they kept silent. Of course, social \r\nmovements and the national Government are respected \r\nfor their decisions and their ability to achieve \r\nconsensus on issues. \r\n The Assembly is aware that we are expanding the \r\ntransformation of our country by putting in place a new \r\npolitical constitution for the Bolivian State. What are \r\nwe attempting to accomplish thereby?  \r\n With regard to the most maligned group in \r\nBolivia’s history — the indigenous peoples — article \r\n1 of the new political Constitution recognizes the rights \r\nof indigenous peoples, as the United Nations has \r\nalready done. Thus, we are talking of a multinational \r\nState where, for the first time, the State is for \r\neveryone — people of mixed race, creole, indigenous \r\nand black. We are all physically diverse and, in our \r\nnew political Constitution of the Bolivian State, we \r\nrecognize the diversity of the people of my country. \r\n However, it is important that we find a way for \r\nthe State and its public institutions to be a solution for \r\nthe Bolivian people. The executive, legislative and \r\npublic powers have to be at the service of the people. \r\nPolitics is service, after all. Our ancestors left us a \r\ntrilogy of indigenous prescriptions: amasua, amayuya \r\nand amaquilla — do not lie, do not steal and do not be \r\nweak. Despite our approximately 20 reform \r\nconstitutions, none has ever recognized these moral \r\nprinciples. They are humanist values that have never \r\nbeen acknowledged by the various legal and \r\nconstitutional instruments of our country.  \r\n Of course, political, civil, labour and cultural \r\nrights, as well as equality between men and women, \r\nwill be enshrined. We have a law by which a minimum \r\nof 30 per cent of women must participate in our \r\ninstitutions of authority. That is equality. We have \r\nmade progress on the local level in that regard, but it \r\nhas been harder to advance at the national level. Under \r\nthe new Constitution, it will be possible to move \r\nforward together. \r\n Opposition groups constantly question me on \r\nwhether the Government is going to put an end to \r\nprivate property. Do I want to take away people’s \r\nhouses and confiscate their cars? That is completely \r\nfalse. Economically, we are very diverse; there is \r\nprivate property and there is State property. The new \r\npolitical Constitution of the Bolivian State enshrines a \r\npluralistic economy in which private property and \r\ncollective property are respected, as is State property. \r\n It is typical, for example, to have collective \r\nproperty in the countryside. Where I was born, there is \r\nno private property. The land is collective and belongs \r\nto the entire community, and that is respected in the \r\nnew political Constitution of the Bolivian State. I \r\nrepeat: We have private and State property. \r\n Under no political constitution of the Bolivian \r\nState was coca leaf recognized as a national product. \r\nScientifically, as some United States and European \r\nuniversities — including Harvard, which we thank —\r\nhave recognized the coca leaf in its natural state is not \r\nharmful to human health. However, it is demonized. \r\nWe are not defending cocaine. I would never do that. \r\nWe do not agree with coca leaf being turned into \r\ncocaine, but in the culture of the indigenous peoples of \r\nthe Andes, it is traditional to consume the coca leaf. I \r\nvery much regret that the United States Drug \r\nEnforcement Agency does not recognize the traditional \r\nconsumption of coca leaf. \r\n The new political Constitution of the Bolivarian \r\nState recognizes coca leaf as a natural product that is a \r\ncultural property of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia. \r\nA/63/PV.52  \r\n \r\n08-60539 4 \r\n \r\nWe have to combat its derivative, and we are doing so \r\nin Bolivia while respecting human rights.  \r\n Furthermore, as recognized in the new draft \r\nConstitution, it is important that we live in harmony \r\nwith mother Earth, not just with human beings. The \r\nnew Constitution is therefore aimed at defending the \r\nenvironment. Defending the environment is defending \r\nhumankind. \r\n The new political Constitution of the Bolivian \r\nState has another new element. It will not be possible \r\nfor any country to set up a military base on Bolivian \r\nterritory. I and my social movement have been victims \r\nof the military bases of the United States; we want to \r\nput an end to that struggle of our peoples and enshrine \r\nin the Constitution the absence of foreign military \r\nbases on Bolivian soil. \r\n The new political Constitution of the Bolivian \r\nState also declares that war will never be waged with \r\nany neighbouring country because war is not a solution \r\nfor our peoples. It brings death and destruction and no \r\none wins. The only winners are the transnational \r\ncompanies, the industrialists and the arms \r\nmanufacturers. To the credit of the conscience of our \r\npeoples and social movements, we reject any \r\ndeclaration of war under the new political Constitution \r\nof the Bolivian State. \r\n I wish today to thank the international community \r\nfor having supported us in this process of change in the \r\ncontext of the cultural and democratic revolution. \r\nThere have been many demonstrations calling for \r\nrespect for human rights. It is very important to be \r\nconstantly with the people, to heed them, to dialogue \r\nwith them and listen to what they are asking for. If the \r\nPresident and the Government cannot meet the \r\ndemands of the people for lack of financial resources, \r\nit is important to acknowledge that; but we are also \r\nseeking funds to address those demands, and when we \r\nspeak to the opposition, we speak with them face to \r\nface and let the people judge who is right. \r\n As we are all aware, these are difficult times for \r\nmy Government, given the provocation coming from \r\ncertain sources. We also have the obligation to do away \r\nwith individualism, sectarianism and regionalism. It is \r\ncrucial to consider the equality of our peoples. We need \r\nto seek equality and justice among all our peoples — \r\nall peoples of the Earth. \r\n In regard to some international issues, I would \r\nrefer to the so-called financial crisis. We have heard \r\nover the past two weeks that developed countries have \r\ngiven 30 times more money to the banks of Wall Street \r\nthan to development aid funds which is needed to meet \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). That \r\nmoney should go to the victims rather than to those \r\nwho have caused this crisis. It should go to those who \r\nhave lost their homes because they cannot pay their \r\ndebts, and to those who have lost their jobs due to this \r\ncrisis. It should not go to the directors of the banks that \r\nhave caused this international crisis. \r\n The so-called new Washington consensus of the \r\nGroup of 20 continues to put its trust in free trade. I \r\nquestion free trade. Free trade is not part and parcel of \r\nfair trade of peoples. Therefore, in order to emerge \r\nfrom the crisis, we must discard the neo-liberal model \r\nand the capitalist system.  \r\n In Bolivia, we have begun to change gradually. \r\nThat has helped us not only to gain self-respect, but \r\nalso to begin to resolve our social problems. How have \r\nwe done so? Pardon me for speaking the truth: I was \r\nelected President with nearly 54 per cent of the vote. \r\nOpposition groups constantly challenged me to \r\nrelinquish my mandate. I accepted, and offered to give \r\nup power and to let the people judge us. There was no \r\nproblem. Our support rose from 54 to 67 per cent. The \r\npeople are so wise. And that is why this economic \r\nmodel must be changed. The unfair trade imposed by \r\nsome international bodies is not a solution for my \r\ncountry or for others.  \r\n In order to emerge from the financial crisis, we \r\nmust change the rules of the World Trade Organization \r\n(WTO). As a union leader, I have participated in quite \r\na few of the international conferences convened as \r\nalternative to the summits of heads of State. Now, I am \r\nmuch more convinced that the time has come to \r\nconsider how to change the WTO rules. The world \r\neconomic system must be restructured by all \r\n192 countries represented here at the United Nations, \r\nnot by just 20 countries. Perhaps those 20 countries \r\nfeel responsible for the financial crisis, which has done \r\ngreat harm to countries throughout the world. That is \r\nwhy all countries must participate actively.  \r\n We support the idea of a United Nations summit \r\naimed at restructuring not only the international \r\nfinancial system, but also the World Bank and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. I wish to say very \r\n A/63/PV.52\r\n \r\n5 08-60539 \r\n \r\nstrongly that it is important that we invest in profound \r\neconomic and social transformation. That means \r\nchanging the economic model. Those of us who have \r\nemerged from poverty and social struggle are \r\nconvinced that it is not only through dialogue and \r\ncooperation, but also, and fundamentally, through the \r\nparticipation of the international community that we \r\ncan change our countries and the entire world.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Bolivia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the Republic \r\nof Bolivia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
