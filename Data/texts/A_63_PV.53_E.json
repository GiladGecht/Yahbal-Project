(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Wolfe \r\n(Jamaica), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 48 \r\n \r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome  \r\nof the 2002 International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development and the preparation of the 2008 \r\nReview Conference \r\n \r\n  Report of the Second Committee (A/63/413) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: If there is no proposal \r\nunder rule 66 of the rules of procedure, may I take it \r\nthat the General Assembly decides not to discuss the \r\nreport of the Second Committee that is before the \r\nAssembly today? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: Statements will therefore \r\nbe limited to explanations of vote. The positions of \r\ndelegations regarding the recommendations of the \r\nSecond Committee have been made clear in the \r\nCommittee and are reflected in the relevant official \r\nrecords. \r\n May I remind members that in accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, a delegation \r\nshould, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, \r\nthat is, either in the Committee or in the plenary \r\nmeeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary \r\nmeeting is different from its vote in the Committee. \r\nAlso, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes \r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Second \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take a decision in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Committee. \r\n The Assembly has before it five draft decisions \r\nrecommended by the Second Committee in paragraph \r\n29 of its report. The Assembly will now take action on \r\nthe five draft decisions one by one. After all the \r\ndecisions have been taken, representatives will again \r\nhave an opportunity to explain their vote or position. \r\n We turn first to draft decision I, entitled \r\n“Arrangements and organization of work of the Follow-\r\nup International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus (Doha, 29 November-2 December \r\n2008)”. The Second Committee adopted draft decision I. \r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to do likewise? \r\n Draft decision I was adopted (decision 63/509). \r\n The Acting President: Draft decision II is entitled \r\n“Provisional rules of procedure for the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nto Review the Implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus (Doha, 29 November-2 December 2008)”. \r\nThe Second Committee adopted draft decision II. May I \r\ntake it that the Assembly wishes to do likewise?  \r\n Draft decision II was adopted (decision 63/510). \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 2 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Draft decision III is \r\nentitled “Provisional agenda for the Follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nto Review the Implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus (Doha, 29 November-2 December 2008)”. \r\nThe Second Committee adopted draft decision III. May \r\nI take it that the Assembly wishes to do likewise?  \r\n Draft decision III was adopted (decision 63/511). \r\n The Acting President: Draft decision IV is \r\nentitled “Accreditation of intergovernmental \r\norganizations to the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to Review \r\nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus \r\n(Doha, 29 November-2 December 2008)”. The Second \r\nCommittee adopted draft decision IV. May I take it that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to do likewise?  \r\n Draft decision IV was adopted (decision 63/512). \r\n The Acting President: Draft decision V is \r\nentitled “Accreditation of non-governmental \r\norganizations to the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to Review \r\nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus \r\n(Doha, 29 November-2 December 2008)”. The Second \r\nCommittee adopted draft decision V. May I take it that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to do likewise? \r\n Draft decision V was adopted (decision 63/513). \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n48. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 114 (continued) \r\n \r\nCooperation between the United Nations and \r\nregional and other organizations \r\n \r\n (l) Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/63/L.26)  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Assembly held its debate on agenda item 114 and \r\nits sub-items (a) to (u) at its 36th and 37th plenary \r\nmeetings, on 3 November 2008. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of \r\nNamibia to introduce draft resolution A/63/L.26. \r\n Mr. Mbuende (Namibia): It is an honour for \r\nNamibia, the country holding the presidency of the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), to introduce to the \r\nAssembly draft resolution A/63/L.26 entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union”. \r\n The draft resolution highlights the important role \r\nworld parliaments are playing in international affairs, \r\nas well as in the work of the United Nations. Special \r\nattention is given to the cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the IPU for the promotion and \r\nprotection of peace and security, conflict prevention, \r\ngender and human rights, good governance and \r\npromotion of democracy, and of social and economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In order to bridge the implementation gap of \r\nvarious United Nations decisions and resolutions and \r\nto ensure greater democratization of the United Nations \r\nsystem, it is important to engage more closely with \r\nnational parliaments and parliamentarians all over the \r\nworld. Such engagement would provide a better \r\nunderstanding of parliamentarians on the importance of \r\ntranslating international commitments into national \r\nlegislation and policies. \r\n Namibia would like to appeal to those Member \r\nStates that have not sponsored this important draft \r\nresolution to do so. We hope this draft resolution will \r\nbe adopted by consensus. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/63/L.26. I wish to \r\nadvise the General Assembly that the following are \r\nadditional sponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, \r\nAndorra, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, \r\nEthiopia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, \r\nGuinea, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Kuwait, \r\nLithuania, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, the \r\nNetherlands, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Poland, \r\nPortugal, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, San \r\nMarino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sri \r\nLanka, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Togo, Turkey, Ukraine and Yemen. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.26. May I take it that the Assembly \r\ndecides to adopt A/63/L.26? \r\n Draft resolution A/63/L.26 was adopted \r\n(resolution 63/24). \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n3 08-60760 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan. \r\n Mr. Haroon (Pakistan): My delegation had \r\nwished to raise a point in connection with draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.26; unfortunately, Sir, you did not \r\nsee me ask for the floor in time. \r\n In operative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution — \r\nand this is a minor addition from the developing \r\ncountries’ point of view — we would have requested \r\nthe insertion of the phrase “capacity-building, \r\ndevelopment”, after the words “democratic \r\ngovernance”. \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (1) of agenda item 114? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: Before proceeding to the \r\nnext agenda item, I would like to appeal to those \r\nMember States intending to submit draft resolutions on \r\nthe remaining sub-items to do so as soon as possible. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 102 \r\n \r\nNotification by the Secretary-General under Article \r\n12, Paragraph 2 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/63/300) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: As members are aware, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 12, paragraph \r\n2, of the Charter of the United Nations, and with the \r\nconsent of the Security Council, the Secretary-General \r\nis mandated to notify the General Assembly of matters \r\nrelative to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity that are being dealt with by the Security \r\nCouncil and of matters with which the Council has \r\nceased to deal. \r\n In this connection, the General Assembly has \r\nbefore it a note by the Secretary-General issued as \r\ndocument A/63/300. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly takes note of that \r\ndocument? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 102? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nAgenda items 9 and 111 \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/63/2) \r\n \r\n  Question of equitable representation on  \r\nand increase in the membership of the  \r\nSecurity Council and related matters \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I shall now read out the \r\nfollowing on behalf of the President of the General \r\nAssembly: \r\n  “As members know, this summer the \r\nhistoric renovation of the United Nations building \r\ngot under way under the Capital Master Plan. \r\nAsbestos, poor lighting, faulty ventilation, leaky \r\nroofs, inadequate security and dated decor \r\ncharacterize the building. \r\n  “Just like the building, the institutions are \r\nalso in desperate need of an overhaul — that is \r\nthe real master plan. Today, we don hard hats and \r\ngleaming new shovels — I am ready to break \r\nground. We are all ready to break ground. We are \r\nready to assume our responsibilities and make the \r\nmost out of our historic opportunity to \r\ndemocratize the Security Council. \r\n  “At the 2005 World Summit, our leaders \r\nvoiced support for, and I quote: \r\n   ‘early reform of the Security  \r\nCouncil — an essential element of our overall \r\neffort to reform the United Nations — in \r\norder to make it more broadly representative, \r\nefficient and transparent and thus to further \r\nenhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy \r\nand implementation of its decisions.’ \r\n(resolution 60/1, para. 153) \r\n  “Our leaders thus already spelled out what \r\nthe objective of Security Council reform is. What \r\nthey did not do, of course, was to define ‘early \r\nreform’. However, it would seem safe to say that \r\nthey did not mean to see another World Summit \r\npass us by with the status quo intact. That is why \r\nwe must move swiftly to bring out the hammer \r\nand nails and rebuild the horseshoe table. The \r\ntwenty-first century does not require a horseshoe \r\ntable, but a circle-shaped one, with room for extra \r\nseats. We must come full circle, realizing our \r\nfounders’ vision of a Council with the legitimacy \r\nto act on behalf of all Member States, in \r\naccordance with Article 24 of the Charter. \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 4 \r\n \r\n  “Thanks to the moral courage and \r\ndiplomatic skills of many great men and women, \r\nmany of them here in the room, we are in an \r\nexcellent position to make change happen. \r\n  “In the final days of the sixty-second \r\nsession, members decided to take a decisive step \r\ntowards Security Council reform by launching \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the sixty-\r\nthird session. Making the most out of that \r\nachievement would be a centrepiece of any \r\nsubsequent General Assembly presidency. \r\nHowever, it places a special responsibility on a \r\ntransformational presidency like mine — a \r\npresidency built around the imperative of a more \r\ndemocratic United Nations, where every country \r\ncounts. Members can count on me and also count \r\non Ambassador Tanin, whose appointment as \r\nVice-Chairman of the Open-Ended Working \r\nGroup and as Chairman of the upcoming \r\nintergovernmental negotiations was universally \r\napplauded. Members can count on us to work our \r\nhearts out. \r\n  “Each and every one of us stands to gain. \r\nPeace and security cannot be maintained by a \r\nSecurity Council that is out of date and out of \r\ntouch. Let our reform effort therefore not run out \r\nof time. A better Council cannot wait until \r\ntomorrow, if we want to have a better tomorrow. \r\n  “So here we are today, poised for progress. \r\nThe platform for progress is decision 62/557. \r\nThis decision is the ground beneath our feet and, \r\nas I have stressed both informally and formally, I \r\nintend to implement it both in letter and in spirit. \r\nThat is why I guarantee the Open-Ended Working \r\nGroup the opportunity to contribute to the \r\nupcoming intergovernmental negotiations in a \r\npositive way and help pave the way towards \r\nthem. That effort is already well underway, with \r\nmeetings both last week and yesterday. To \r\nmaximize the chances of success, I will shortly \r\npresent a work plan for the Working Group. \r\nAbove all, the plan will be characterized by \r\nambition: ambition not to waste a single minute; \r\nambition to, if possible, finish early, before the \r\n1 February deadline. \r\n  “Whatever happens in the Working Group, \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations will start at \r\nthe very latest on 28 February 2009. However, it \r\nis my firm belief that we must work as hard as \r\npossible to be able to start as early as possible.  \r\n  “For this entire enterprise to prosper, one \r\nprinciple in particular should in my view be \r\nrespected: we should not reinvent the wheel. Over \r\nthe years, members, many of them personally, \r\nhave been quite successful at paving the way \r\ntowards the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nculminating in decision 62/557. Standing on the \r\nshoulders of giants, we can deliver on its \r\npromise. I look forward to hearing the remarks of \r\nmembers, particularly on the plans to contribute \r\nto that endeavour, as I am sure members will to \r\nthe best of their abilities. \r\n  “However, as long as the Council remains \r\nunreformed, we need to make an extra effort to \r\nhold it to account. Today, the General Assembly \r\nhas that opportunity and I have encouraged \r\nMember States beforehand to use this debate \r\nespecially to take advantage of that opportunity. \r\nBefore us is the report of the Security Council. It \r\nis a factual account of the Council’s work during \r\nthe period just past: 219 formal meetings, 58 \r\nresolutions and 50 presidential statements. The \r\nreport is full of such facts and figures on the \r\nCouncil’s efforts to fulfil its mandate of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n  “At the end of last year’s debate, President \r\nKerim made the following observation: \r\n   ‘... some serious concerns were \r\nexpressed regarding the report itself, in \r\nparticular the lack of comprehensive \r\nevaluation of the various deliberations of \r\nthe Council. … [M]any participants in the \r\ndebate stressed the importance that the \r\nreport should in future be more analytical \r\nand substantive.’ (A/62/PV.51, p. 14)  \r\n  “It is my sincere hope that we will not let \r\nthat hold us back in our debate today, either in \r\nour dialogue with the Council or in our \r\nevaluation of its work. If the report indeed lacks \r\nevaluation and analysis, then the Assembly \r\nshould make its own. Nothing less is expected \r\nfrom a General Assembly that wants to hold its \r\nown within the United Nations — an Assembly \r\nthat truly engages the Council at the same time as \r\nit engages in self-renewal.  \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n5 08-60760 \r\n \r\n  “Next to Security Council reform, this \r\nrenaissance of the General Assembly constitutes \r\nanother crucial component of that real master \r\nplan I mentioned at the outset of my statement: \r\noverhaul not only of the United Nations physical \r\nstructure, but of its institutions as well; not of the \r\nexterior, but of the interior. Internal change is far \r\nmore difficult to bring about than external \r\nchange. The difference is like that between an \r\nopen-heart operation and a facelift: the open-\r\nheart operation involves opening the chest. In \r\nother words, we face enormous resistance, but we \r\ncan also expect much greater rewards: a world \r\nbody with a new lease on life.” \r\n I now give the floor to the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, His Excellency Mr. Jorge Urbina, to \r\nintroduce the report of the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of all members of the Security Council, I would \r\nlike to congratulate Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election as President of the sixty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly. It is our sincere \r\nhope that, under his leadership and with his experience, \r\nwe will be able to increase and enhance the \r\ncooperation between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n In my capacity as President of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of November, it is my honour to \r\nintroduce the annual report of the Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, contained in document A/63/2. \r\nBefore turning to the report, I should like, on behalf of \r\nthe Council, to thank the delegation of Viet Nam for its \r\nefforts in the preparation and completion of this report. \r\nIn particular, we recognize its initiative to convene an \r\ninformal meeting with the Council’s entire membership \r\nto discuss the best way to prepare the report, with a \r\nview to making it more analytical, balanced and \r\nsubstantive. \r\n Over the past few years, the complexity and \r\nmultidimensional character of the international \r\nsituation have created an ever-increasing demand for \r\nUnited Nations activities in the areas of conflict \r\nprevention, mediation and resolution, as well as \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding activities. Against this \r\nbackdrop, the Security Council has faced increasingly \r\ncomplex responsibilities in fulfilling its mandate of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n In order to better reflect the fact that the role and \r\nactivity of the Council have been extended in difficult \r\ncircumstances, the quality of the annual report being \r\nsubmitted today to the General Assembly should be \r\neven more reliable in all aspects. We believe that the \r\ngradual improvements can not only improve the \r\nperception and contribution of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations in general and other relevant parties \r\ninterested in what the Council does, but that they can \r\nalso enhance its authority and efficiency as it carries \r\nout its mandates. \r\n I am particularly pleased to inform the Assembly \r\nthat the Council is paying particular attention to \r\nrequests from the membership regarding its working \r\nmethods. There is still room for making improvements \r\nhere, and we must do so in order to further the cause of \r\ntransparency, access to the Council and accountability. \r\nHowever, on occasion it is sometimes easier to reach \r\nagreements than to explain how such agreements were \r\nactually reached. It would therefore be wise to consider \r\nin depth how much more we can and should expect \r\nfrom the report of the Security Council in terms of its \r\nanalytic capability. \r\n The report covers the Council’s work during the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008. During \r\nthis period, the Council adopted 58 resolutions and 50 \r\npresidential statements. It held 219 formal meetings, of \r\nwhich 191 were public. In addition, there were 18 \r\nmeetings with troop-contributing countries. The \r\nCouncil also held 177 private consultations.  \r\n The introductory part of the report that we have \r\nprepared provides insights into the way in which the \r\nCouncil addressed a wide array of issues during the \r\ncourse of another year of intensive work, reflecting \r\nboth the Council’s achievements and situations and \r\ncircumstances in which it was unable to take action. In \r\nevery case, we have endeavoured to reflect the general \r\nviews expressed by Council members.  \r\n With regard to developments in conflicts and \r\ndisputes in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and \r\nthe Balkans, the introduction elaborates on the regular \r\nbriefings by the Secretariat, interventions by countries \r\nand parties concerned, the Council’s communications \r\nwith troop-contributing countries, and follow-up \r\ndeliberations and actions of the Council to respond to \r\nsituations under review.  \r\n A large part of the introduction is devoted to \r\ngeneral issues, ranging from terrorism, the non-\r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 6 \r\n \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the \r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict, children and \r\narmed conflict, and women and peace and security to \r\nthe work of subsidiary organs of the Council, such as \r\nthe sanctions Committees, the Informal Working Group \r\non Documentation and Other Procedural Questions and \r\nthe Working Group of the Whole on United Nations \r\nPeacekeeping Operations. Coordination and \r\ncooperation with the other principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, as well as the evolving role of regional \r\nand subregional organizations, have also been \r\nhighlighted as appropriate.  \r\n The body of the report is essentially a \r\ncompilation of the documents considered or issued by \r\nthe Council. These documents include a detailed \r\naccount of the meetings held by the Council, the \r\noutcomes of those meetings when there were outcomes, \r\nand the documentation that served as a basis for \r\nmeetings. It also details the list of issues that were \r\nbrought to the attention of the Council but that were \r\nnot discussed at meetings of the Council during the \r\nperiod covered in the report.  \r\n I would like to point out that the format of the \r\nreport now before the General Assembly corresponds \r\nto the provisions included in the note by the President \r\nof the Security Council dated 19 July 2006 \r\n(S/2006/507), in order to ensure that the report prove \r\nmore useful.  \r\n In conclusion, on behalf of all Security Council \r\nmembers, I thank the General Assembly for this \r\nopportunity to inform its members of the activities of \r\nthe Council over the past year. I would also to thank, \r\non behalf of the Council, the Secretary-General and \r\nSecretariat staff for their work, their invaluable support \r\nfor the development of the Council’s activities, and \r\ntheir professionalism in the discharge of their \r\nresponsibilities enabling the Council to fulfil its \r\nmandate. \r\n I would now like to make some comments in my \r\ncapacity as the Permanent Representative of Costa \r\nRica.  \r\n In the recent chronicles of the Assembly’s history, \r\nI think that there are no precedents for a delegation as \r\nPresident-in-office of the Council speaking \r\nsubsequently to make a comment on the annual report \r\nof the General Assembly in a national capacity. \r\n We believe that, in so doing, we are doing \r\nsomething new in the context of our search to improve \r\nthe working methods of the Council. We wish to \r\ninnovate in a way that can turn what has always been a \r\nroutine exercise into something more substantive. We \r\ntrust that, in this way, we can make a contribution to \r\nthe analysis of the work of the Council in the period \r\nunder review.  \r\n For Costa Rica, a permanent member of this \r\nGeneral Assembly, the introduction of the annual report \r\nof the Security Council to the Assembly should not be \r\na mere exercise of rhetoric, nor should it become a \r\nmere statement of facts. A true consideration of the \r\nreport requires an analytical and critical approach to \r\nthe work of the Council in the period under review, in \r\nobservation of its mandate and its organic relationship \r\nto the Assembly in accordance with the provisions of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.  \r\n We believe that, despite the endeavours made and \r\nthe desire to include in the introduction to the report \r\nboth the achievements and the situations and \r\ncircumstances in which the Council was unable to act, \r\nwe agree with the assessment made by the Council \r\nitself to the effect that the report and its quality should \r\nimprove even further. We wish to follow the good \r\npractice implemented by Viet Nam to hold \r\nconsultations on the annual report with members in \r\ngeneral, and we refer in particular to the meeting held \r\nto provide information on the preparation of the report \r\nas its presidency came to an end. We urge the States \r\nthat will be entrusted with that task in the future to \r\ncontinue the improvement introduced by the delegation \r\nof Viet Nam.  \r\n We must acknowledge that the report just \r\nsubmitted by the Council continues to be limited and, \r\nin our judgement, descriptive in its approach. It does \r\nnot lift the veil of opacity shrouding Council action in \r\nthe majority of cases.  \r\n I should like to stress that it is important and \r\nappropriate that the report assess the Security \r\nCouncil’s compliance or non-compliance with its \r\nCharter mandates. Specifically, I should like to \r\nhighlight the Council’s repeated non-compliance with a \r\nmandate as essential as that set out in Article 26, as we \r\nwill have the opportunity to see during tomorrow’s \r\nCouncil debate. Of all the Charter’s Articles, including \r\nthe 32 directly related to the Council, Article 26 has \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n7 08-60760 \r\n \r\nhad a special characteristic over the years: it has been a \r\ndead letter.  \r\n Although the Security Council must address \r\nsituations representing threats to international peace \r\nand security, it has remained silent by failing to \r\nexercise its obligatory powers under Article 26 in the \r\narea of arms control and reduction. This repeated \r\nnon-compliance over many years is related to a \r\nmandate that goes to the very heart of the Organization \r\nand represents, we believe, a shirking of duty. The \r\npresent annual report, like previous ones, makes no \r\nreference whatsoever to the fact that the Council is \r\nunwilling or unable to carry out a mandate that is \r\ncurrently in force and is still not being fulfilled under \r\nArticle 26 of the Charter. \r\n Whereas Article 26 is not being implemented by \r\nthe Council, Article 25 is not being complied with by \r\nvarious States that refuse to accept the obligations \r\narising from Council decisions. It would appear that in \r\na number of cases, given the Council’s difficulties in \r\nensuring compliance with its resolutions, we are \r\nwitnessing the modification — and thus the \r\nundermining — of Article 25, whereby all States \r\nagreed to accept and implement Council decisions. \r\nThat is particularly worrisome, because it involves \r\nobligations arising from resolutions adopted under \r\nChapter VII. Therefore, since compliance with Article \r\n25 is directly related to the Council’s effectiveness, this \r\nis an issue that should be analysed in depth in the \r\nannual report. \r\n Another Charter mandate, while of a more \r\nprocedural nature, is related to the submission of \r\nspecial reports in accordance with Articles 15 and 24 — \r\narticles that also appear to have fallen into disuse. In \r\nthis Organization, where reports on the most diverse \r\nsubjects proliferate, we have been unable to systematize \r\nthe submission of special reports on issues on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda that thus merit such treatment. We \r\nbelieve that, in cases such as those involving the \r\nimposition of sanctions or other coercive measures or \r\nthe adoption of measures for general implementation \r\nunder Chapter VII — or even cases in which the \r\nCouncil cannot achieve the necessary consensus or \r\nwhere the threat of the veto exists — it is appropriate to \r\nsubmit special reports. In our view, during the period \r\nunder review, cases such as Kosovo, Zimbabwe or the \r\nOil-for-Food Programme, inter alia, would have \r\nmerited the submission of special reports to the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Costa Rica has been keen to seek correct \r\nimplementation of the provisions set out in Articles 31 \r\nand 32 regarding participation by members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in Security Council debates when \r\ntheir interests are being affected or when they are \r\nparties to a dispute being considered by the Council. In \r\nthat connection, we have insisted on speaking after the \r\nStates that are participating pursuant to Articles 31 and \r\n32, rather than before, as is the custom. We do not see \r\nthe logic in taking a position and then listening to all \r\nthe information and the positions that those most \r\ndirectly affected consider it necessary to share with the \r\nCouncil. \r\n Although the report of the Council fails to assess \r\nthe implementation of Articles 31 and 32, we \r\ncongratulate the delegation of Belgium on having \r\ncompiled information that has enabled us to see \r\napparent improvement in that area. According to those \r\ndata, during the second half of 2006, Council members \r\nspoke before invited States in 48.3 per cent of the \r\nmeetings held. That percentage increased to 73 in 2007 \r\nand then fell to 26.5 in the first half of 2008. We hope \r\nthat, with the assistance of all Council members, this \r\nvolatile figure can be maintained at the latter lower \r\nnumber or further reduced.  \r\n In that connection, we also consider it appropriate \r\nto assess the implementation of rule 48 of the Security \r\nCouncil’s provisional rules of procedure, which \r\nprovides that “unless it decides otherwise, the Security \r\nCouncil shall meet in public”. Once again, we are \r\nbasing our position on information compiled by the \r\nBelgian delegation, which indicates that, while the \r\nCouncil met in private consultations 44 per cent of the \r\ntime during the second half of 2006, that percentage \r\nincreased slightly to 45.5 in 2007 and then fell to 41.4 \r\nin the first half of 2008. Although we recognize that \r\nnot all Council deliberations can be held in public, we \r\nbelieve that private consultations should be the \r\nexception, not the rule.  \r\n Costa Rica sought to broaden the implementation \r\nof rule 48 on the basis of the principle of publicizing \r\nour Council presidency’s programme of work. We \r\nexpress our appreciation for the support received \r\nthrough the implementation of that measure by various \r\nelected members, in particular Panama and South \r\nAfrica. We hope that, through the implementation of \r\nthis principle on publicity, those subsequently in the \r\npresidency of the Council will seek to consolidate the \r\nprecedent.  \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 8 \r\n \r\n I wish to refer briefly to the matter of Iraq. We \r\nwould like to explain our position to the Assembly with \r\nregard to the oil-for-food programme, given that the \r\nmajority of the Assembly is opposed to it and that it has \r\nnot been clearly reflected in the report. Costa Rica is \r\nnot opposed to closing the programme, but we think \r\nthat the established rules should be followed in \r\nprocessing the pending letters of credit for payment, \r\nthat is, documentation should be presented attesting that \r\nthe services or products were really received by Iraq.  \r\n We are not willing to repeat the mistakes of the \r\npast made by the Committee established pursuant to \r\nSecurity Council resolution 661 (1990). Costa Rica has \r\ninterrupted the no-objection procedure, through which \r\nan attempt was made to end the programme without the \r\nrelevant documentation being required. We find such a \r\nblind conclusion of the programme inadmissible, \r\nparticularly if we take into account the failures \r\nmentioned in the Volcker report with regard to the \r\nchanges in prices and services. It is also inadmissible \r\nin the light of the fact that many of the companies that \r\nstill have payments pending were expressly questioned \r\nin that report.  \r\n Given these doubts, Costa Rica has decided to \r\nmaintain the hold. In August, we distributed a note \r\nasking the Council to coordinate with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in order to ensure that the conclusion of the \r\noil-for-food programme would be carried out with all \r\ndue prudence in order to avoid new criticism being \r\nlevelled against the United Nations. That has been the \r\nsole motive guiding our actions. Shortly afterwards, we \r\nsent a second note to the Secretary-General requesting \r\ninformation on the companies and people with \r\noutstanding invoices to compare these lists with the \r\nannexes of the Volcker report. We are still waiting for a \r\nreply to that request.  \r\n Lastly, as an elected member of the Security \r\nCouncil, we would like to shoulder the commitment to \r\nbring to the Council’s attention those improvements \r\nand suggestions that the Assembly recommends on the \r\nbasis of its consideration of the annual report of the \r\nCouncil. I wish to express my thanks for the support \r\nthat we have received and to reiterate our willingness \r\nto provide the Assembly with information we have on \r\nthe Council’s business. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bagudu Hirse, Minister of State for \r\nForeign Affairs of Nigeria. \r\n Mr. Hirse (Nigeria): On behalf of the delegation \r\nof Nigeria, I have the honour to express our gratitude \r\nto Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for scheduling this \r\nGeneral Assembly debate on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters, pursuant to \r\nthe decision of our leaders in September 2005. \r\n It has always been the view of Nigeria that the \r\nreform of the United Nations would not be complete \r\nwithout a fundamental reform of and increase in the \r\nsize and the composition of the Security Council to \r\nreflect the current global realities, thereby enabling the \r\nCouncil to gain in stature and credibility and ensuring \r\nthat its decisions attract the wider support of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Africa’s position on Security Council reform has \r\nbeen well articulated in the decisions taken by African \r\nheads of State and Government at the fifth and sixth \r\nordinary sessions of the Assembly of the African \r\nUnion, held respectively in Sirte, Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya, in July 2005 and in Khartoum in January \r\n2006. We strongly feel that it would be a great \r\ndisservice to the United Nations if Member States \r\ncontinued to prevaricate on this vital matter. \r\n While Nigeria respects the viewpoints of those \r\nMember States that insist on the need for consensus \r\nbefore a decision is taken on the framework and \r\nmodalities of the reform, we equally recognize that, in \r\nthe greater national interests of our respective peoples, \r\nthe search for consensus should not inhibit the taking \r\nof important and crucial decisions. It is essential, \r\ntherefore, that in the interest of our Organization and \r\nits future we exert every effort to ensure a speedy and \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the reform process. \r\n This may well entail some element of flexibility, \r\nbut flexibility informed by a shared view that Council \r\nreform in all its aspects is long overdue. If we proceed \r\nalong this path, Nigeria is confident that we will, in the \r\nimmediate future, achieve that goal and thereby not \r\nonly rekindle the hopes and confidence of mankind in \r\nthe United Nations, but also prove wrong the \r\nOrganization’s few vocal critics, who wrongly argue \r\nthat Member States individually and collectively \r\ncannot rise to the challenges of true multilateralism. \r\nLet us therefore send forth from this hallowed Hall a \r\nclear message of our common resolve not to let slip yet \r\nanother opportunity to address this matter once and for \r\nall. \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n9 08-60760 \r\n \r\n There are also those who believe that States \r\nMembers of this Organization should be content with \r\nmerely tinkering with the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council and that this would better serve the \r\ninterests of the broader membership. Although the full \r\nimplications of such a position for overall United \r\nNations reform have been the subject of discussions in \r\ninformal consultations in the past, Nigeria considers it \r\nnecessary to restate that this approach would hardly \r\naddress the fundamental issue of inequity that the \r\nCouncil, as currently constituted, represents. \r\n Nigeria strongly believes that, in the pursuit of \r\nthe objective of reforming the Security Council, \r\nAfrica’s legitimate aspirations should be addressed, as \r\nAfrica is the only region without representation in the \r\npermanent membership category of the Security \r\nCouncil, even though 60 per cent of the issues \r\naddressed by the Council relate to the continent. We \r\ntherefore identify with those Member States whose \r\ninitiatives boldly and substantially take into account \r\nAfrica’s primary interests and concerns on Security \r\nCouncil reform. Nigeria also believes that the \r\npermanent membership of the Council should reflect \r\ncultural and geographical diversity. \r\n Lastly, Nigeria is encouraged by the unanimous \r\nadoption of decision 62/557, in which the General \r\nAssembly mandated that intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations should commence in the informal plenary \r\nof the Assembly not later than 28 February 2009. Our \r\nunderstanding of this decision is that the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group should come to an end in order to \r\nallow intergovernmental negotiations to commence. We \r\nare of the view that the decision to be reached at the \r\nend of the negotiations should be democratic in nature, \r\nrespecting consensus as an ideal but, if necessary, \r\ninvolve a majority decision. This is in keeping with \r\nboth the rules of procedure of the General Assembly \r\nand democratic principles. The Assembly cannot delay \r\nthis matter any further. \r\n Mr. Hackett (Barbados): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the 14 States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) that are also \r\nmembers of the United Nations on agenda item 9, \r\n“Report of the Security Council”, and item 111, \r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”. \r\n At the outset, I would like to thank Ambassador \r\nJorge Urbina, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica \r\nand current President of the Security Council, for his \r\ndetailed presentation of the report of the Council \r\n(A/63/2). CARICOM commends the members of the \r\nCouncil for the work that they have undertaken during \r\nthe reporting period. \r\n The work of the Council over the past year \r\ncovered virtually all regions of the world, although the \r\nprincipal focus continued to be on Africa. CARICOM \r\nwould like to thank the members of the Council for \r\ntheir efforts in seeking to bring peace and stability to \r\nthe various conflict situations around the world. We \r\nwelcome the attention that the Council has paid to the \r\nsituation in Haiti and the support provided to the \r\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \r\n(MINUSTAH). The extension of MINUSTAH’s \r\nmandate will provide further opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to continue to support the \r\nHaitian political leadership and the Haitian people in \r\nrebuilding the country and progressing towards \r\nsustainable development. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \r\nsession, His Excellency Srgjan Kerim, for the \r\npreparation of the report of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on Security Council reform that we have before \r\nus today. CARICOM continues to believe that Security \r\nCouncil reform needs to be one of the priority issues \r\nthat should be addressed by the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \r\nreflected the resolve of world leaders to reform several \r\nareas of the United Nations architecture, including the \r\nSecurity Council. Member States said then that there \r\nmust be a constant process of review, reform and \r\nrenewal of the Organization so that it can remain \r\nrelevant to the continuously changing international \r\nclimate. This led to the creation of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Human Rights Council, the \r\nrevitalization of the Economic and Social Council and \r\na number of management initiatives in the \r\nadministration area. It is of great disappointment to \r\nCARICOM, however, that reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, the main organ of the United Nations that is \r\nprimarily responsible for achieving global peace and \r\nsecurity, continues to elude us; for world leaders also \r\nsaid at that 2005 Summit that early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council is “an essential element of our overall \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 10 \r\n \r\neffort to reform the United Nations in order to make it \r\nmore broadly representative, efficient and transparent” \r\n(resolution 60/1, para. 153). \r\n Despite a nearly four-fold increase in the \r\nmembership of the United Nations, the size and \r\ncomposition of the Security Council have remained \r\nalmost unchanged since its creation, albeit for a change \r\nin size in the membership of the non-permanent \r\nmembers in 1965. Thus, 60 years after the founding of \r\nthe United Nations, the composition of the Security \r\nCouncil no longer reflects current political realities. \r\n We commend the efforts of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session, and the \r\nmembers of his task force, for the work undertaken \r\nover the past year on the issue of Security Council \r\nreform. Those efforts were focused on identifying \r\nconcrete elements of negotiables that could form the \r\nbasis for intergovernmental negotiations. The task \r\nforce undertook extensive consultations, with a view to \r\nidentifying these elements, and reflected them in their \r\nreport. We believe that the consultations to date have \r\nprovided useful references and relevant ideas that can \r\nbe the basis for intergovernmental negotiations; and \r\nwith the mandate from the 2005 United Nations \r\nSummit, and more recently General Assembly decision \r\n62/557 of 15 September 2008, we believe that \r\nintergovernmental negotiations should begin without \r\nmuch further delay. \r\n Indeed, the issues of modalities and framework \r\nfor the intergovernmental process have already been \r\nsettled, in our view, as outlined in decision 62/557. The \r\nframework for the intergovernmental negotiations is \r\nthe informal plenary of the United Nations General \r\nAssembly, with all of the attendant rules and \r\nprocedures of the Assembly, and the modalities are all \r\nthe positions and proposals advanced by Member \r\nStates. CARICOM countries stand ready to participate \r\nfully in these negotiations, with a view to achieving a \r\nsuccessful outcome by the end of this session. \r\n In this regard, CARICOM member States \r\nreiterate their belief that a reformed Security Council \r\nshould have an increase in membership in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories. We further \r\nbelieve that additional permanent members should \r\ncome from both the developed and developing worlds, \r\nand that arrangements for the increase in the number of \r\nnon-permanent members should allow for greater \r\nrepresentation from small and island States. The use of \r\nthe veto should be limited to actions taken under \r\nChapter VII of the Charter, with a move towards its \r\neventual abolition. We also believe that a review \r\nmechanism after a reasonable period of time will be \r\nessential. \r\n Comprehensive reform of the Security Council is \r\nfundamentally grounded in the reform of the working \r\nmethods of the Council. Thus, CARICOM sees the \r\nneed for greater transparency and openness in the \r\nworking methods of the Council. More specifically, we \r\nsuggest that there be more frequent open debates of the \r\nSecurity Council to allow for greater inclusiveness and \r\nparticipation of non-member States, for such open \r\ndebates provide, we believe, national and regional \r\nperspectives that can assist the Council in addressing \r\neffectively the crises and issues with which it is seized. \r\nWe also believe that more comprehensive Council \r\nbriefings to non-members should be held in order to \r\nkeep all delegations fully informed of the activities of \r\nthe Council.  \r\n We are heartened that there is greater acceptance \r\nof the view that the Security Council should be \r\naccountable to the General Assembly. In this regard, \r\nwe again request that the reports of the Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, such as the one presented today, \r\nshould be more substantive and analytical, thus \r\nproviding a basis for a more interactive and meaningful \r\ndebate by the Assembly on the work of the Council. \r\n Achieving success in these intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations will require strong commitment on the \r\npart of all Member States. CARICOM believes that \r\nconsultations carried out over the past 15 years, \r\nparticularly including the last two, provide the critical \r\nelements that can serve as the basis for these \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Thus, it should be \r\npossible to start intergovernmental negotiations quite \r\nsoon. Together we should seek to create a reformed \r\norgan with an expanded membership that better reflects \r\ncontemporary world realities, an organ that possesses a \r\nset of working methods which are formalized, clear \r\nand transparent and which provide for greater \r\naccessibility to its work by non-members. This we \r\nbelieve will make the Council more broadly \r\nrepresentative, thereby increasing its legitimacy, and \r\nwill make it a more effective body which is responsive \r\nto the views and needs of all Member States and has an \r\nenhanced capacity to act when faced with threats to \r\npeace and security. \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n11 08-60760 \r\n \r\n Mr. Soborun (Mauritius): Once again, I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the African Group and to \r\ncommend the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening today’s meeting to discuss the report of the \r\nSecurity Council, under agenda item 9, and to consider \r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nrelated matters, under agenda item 111. Allow me also \r\nat the very outset to thank His Excellency Mr. Jorge \r\nUrbina, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica and \r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of \r\nNovember, for the presentation of the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/63/2). Furthermore, the African \r\nGroup associates itself with the statement to be made by \r\nthe representative of Cuba on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n The African Group appreciates the efforts of the \r\nSecurity Council in peacekeeping, peacebuilding and \r\nthe maintenance of peace and security in conflict \r\nsituations, particularly in Africa. However, once again \r\nit is noted that the report of the Council is more a \r\nstatement of events in chronological order than an \r\nanalytical report which could provide an opportunity \r\nfor Member States to assess the strengths and failures \r\nof the Council in conflict situations. Moreover, the \r\nGroup certainly shares the growing concern about the \r\ngradual encroachment by the Security Council on the \r\npowers and the mandate of the General Assembly. In \r\nthis context, it is necessary that resolutions 51/193, \r\n58/126 and 59/313, which aim at facilitating the \r\nSecurity Council’s accountability to the General \r\nAssembly, are implemented without any further delay. \r\nFurthermore, the Council’s rules of procedure, which \r\nstill remain provisional after six decades, urgently need \r\nto be formalized. In addition, closer coordination \r\namong the Presidents of the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council \r\ncan only augur well for the Organization. \r\n The global crises we are facing at present, such as \r\nthe energy crisis, food crisis, financial crisis and \r\nclimate change, make it all the more necessary to effect \r\nthe expeditious and meaningful reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in a comprehensive manner which takes into \r\naccount representativity and the geopolitical realities \r\nof the twenty-first century. The African position, \r\nspelled out in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration on the comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, has been stated several times in this \r\nbody. It is not our intention this morning to repeat it \r\nagain.  \r\n Suffice it, however, to recall that the African \r\ncommon position, as spelled out in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, calls for no less than two permanent seats, \r\nwith all the prerogatives and privileges of permanent \r\nmembership, including the right of veto, and also five \r\nnon-permanent seats for Africa. Even though Africa is \r\nopposed in principle to the veto, it is of the view that, \r\nso long as the veto exists and as a matter of common \r\njustice, it should be made available to all new \r\npermanent members of the Security Council.  \r\n This African position is intended to assert \r\nunequivocally the legitimate claim of Africa and to \r\nensure that Africa is fully represented in all decision-\r\nmaking organs of the United Nations, and in the \r\nSecurity Council in particular. \r\n The African Group welcomes the decision of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to commence in the \r\ninformal plenary of the General Assembly the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, in accordance with \r\nAssembly decision 62/577. We extend our fullest \r\nsupport to His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann in this endeavour and also to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on behalf of the President of the General \r\nAssembly. I would like to once again bring to the \r\nattention of the General Assembly that, in paragraph 3 \r\nof the decision of the African Union contained in \r\ndocument Assembly/AU/Dec.184 (X), the 53 African \r\nheads of State and Government directed  \r\n “the African Permanent Representatives to the \r\nUnited Nations to participate in the forthcoming \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the basis of the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration and \r\nto report to the Assembly accordingly, should \r\nthey require further guidance”. \r\n That decision is almost a year old now. The next \r\nAfrican Union summit is scheduled for January 2009. \r\nWe hope that at that time the African Permanent \r\nRepresentatives will have something worthy to report \r\non the reform of the Security Council, in particular on \r\nthe commencement of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, to their heads of State and Government. \r\n The African Group looks forward to starting at \r\nmeaningful and constructive intergovernmental \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 12 \r\n \r\nnegotiations in compliance with the unanimous \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 62/577, as soon as \r\npossible, but in no case later than 28 February 2009. \r\n Mrs. Núñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I have the honour to address the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\n(NAM). First of all, we thank His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Jorge Urbina, Permanent Representative \r\nof Costa Rica and President of the Security Council for \r\nthe month of November, for the presentation of the \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/63/2). \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement takes note of the \r\nefforts undertaken to improve the quality of this year’s \r\nannual report and to submit it on time to the General \r\nAssembly. At the same time, the Movement reiterates \r\nthat much more should be done with regard to the \r\ncontent of the report. We call on the Security Council \r\nto submit to the General Assembly comprehensive and \r\nanalytical annual reports which evaluate the work of \r\nthe Council, including cases on which the Council has \r\nfailed to take decisions, as well as the views expressed \r\nby its members during the consideration of the agenda \r\nitems before it. \r\n We welcome as a positive step the holding of an \r\ninformal meeting with United Nations Member States \r\nby the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which held the \r\npresidency of the Security Council in July this year, as \r\npart of the process of preparing the annual report. We \r\ncall for more regular interactions in the future between \r\nthe country holding the July presidency of the Council \r\nand the wider membership of the United Nations, in \r\norder to help enhance the quality of the reports. We \r\nalso call on the Security Council to submit special \r\nreports for the consideration of the General Assembly, \r\npursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, and Article 24, \r\nparagraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nPresidents of the Security Council should ensure that \r\ntheir monthly assessments are comprehensive and \r\nanalytical and that they are issued in timely fashion. \r\nThe General Assembly could propose parameters for \r\ndrawing up such assessments. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement reiterates its \r\nconcern over the increasing and continuing \r\nencroachment by the Security Council on issues that \r\nclearly fall within the functions and powers of other \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations and their \r\nsubsidiary bodies. The Council must fully observe all \r\nCharter provisions as well as all General Assembly \r\nresolutions that clarify its relationship with the \r\nAssembly and the other principal organs. Close \r\ncooperation and coordination among all principal \r\norgans is indispensable in order to enable the United \r\nNations to remain relevant and capable of meeting the \r\nexisting, new and emerging threats and challenges.  \r\n We call on the Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecurity Council to meet regularly to discuss and \r\ncoordinate among themselves issues related to the \r\nagendas and programmes of work of the respective \r\nprincipal organs that they represent. NAM also calls on \r\nthe Security Council to take fully into account the \r\nrecommendations of the General Assembly on matters \r\nrelating to international peace and security, consistent \r\nwith Article 11, paragraph 2, of the Charter. \r\n The Movement remains concerned at the lack of \r\nprogress in the General Assembly discussions on the \r\nreform of the Security Council. The discussions have \r\nshown that while there has been a convergence of \r\nviews on a number of issues, major differences still \r\nexist on many others. \r\n The Movement looks forward to the full \r\nimplementation of decision 62/557, adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 15 September 2008. The \r\nMovement expresses its full support for the Assembly \r\nPresident in this process, as well as for His Excellency \r\nMr. Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, in his work as Vice-Chair of the Open-\r\nended Working Group and as chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on behalf of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. \r\n NAM reiterates the fact that the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council should not be confined to the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and an increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council. It should \r\nalso address substantive issues relating to the Council’s \r\nagenda, working methods and decision-making \r\nprocesses. \r\n In recent years, the Security Council has been too \r\nquick to threaten or authorize enforcement action in \r\nsome cases while being silent and inactive in others. \r\nFurthermore, the Council has increasingly resorted to \r\nChapter VII of the Charter as an umbrella for \r\naddressing issues that do not necessarily pose an \r\nimmediate threat to international peace and security. \r\nInstead of excessive and hasty use of Chapter VII, \r\nefforts should be made to fully utilize the provisions of \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n13 08-60760 \r\n \r\nChapters VI and VIII for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. Chapter VII should be invoked, as intended, \r\nas a measure of last resort. Unfortunately, in some \r\ncases provisions of Articles 41 and 42 have been too \r\nquickly resorted to when the other options have not \r\nbeen fully exhausted. \r\n Sanctions imposed by the Security Council \r\nremain an issue of serious concern to the non-aligned \r\ncountries. In accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter, the option of imposing sanctions should be \r\nconsidered only after all means for peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes under Chapter VI of the Charter have been \r\nexhausted and the short-term and long-term effects of \r\nsuch sanctions have been analysed in detail. The \r\nobjectives of sanctions should be clearly defined and \r\nthe period of their imposition should be specified. \r\nSanctions should be based on tenable legal grounds and \r\nshould be lifted as soon as the objectives are achieved. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement considers that some \r\nimprovements have been made in the Council’s \r\nworking methods. But they are clearly not enough and \r\nleave much room for improvement. The Council’s open \r\ndebate on its working methods, held on 27 August \r\n2008, was a step in the right direction, almost 15 years \r\nafter the last such debate on the issue. We sincerely \r\nhope that it will be the first step towards the regular \r\nand comprehensive consideration of that important \r\nissue within the Council, taking fully into account the \r\nviews of countries not members of the Council. \r\n Transparency, openness and consistency are key \r\nelements that the Security Council should observe in \r\nall of its activities, approaches and procedures. \r\nRegrettably, the Council has neglected those important \r\nfactors on numerous occasions. The Council must \r\ncomply with the provisions of Article 31 of the Charter, \r\nwhich allow any State not a Council member to \r\nparticipate in discussions on matters affecting it. Rule \r\n48 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure \r\nshould be duly observed. Closed meetings and informal \r\nconsultations should be kept to a minimum and held on \r\nan exceptional basis, as they were meant to be. \r\n It is the position of NAM that the objectives of \r\nSecurity Council reform, which should be addressed in \r\na comprehensive, transparent and balanced manner, \r\ninclude the following. The Council’s agenda should \r\nreflect the needs and interests of both developing and \r\ndeveloped countries equally, in an objective, rational, \r\nnon-selective and non-arbitrary manner. The \r\nenlargement of the Council must lead to a more \r\ndemocratic, more representative, more responsible and \r\nmore effective Council. The Council’s rules of \r\nprocedure, which have remained provisional for more \r\nthan 60 years, should be made official in order to \r\nimprove its transparency and accountability. The \r\ndecision-making process of the Council should be \r\ndemocratized, including by limiting and curtailing the \r\nuse of the veto with a view to its eventual elimination. \r\n The countries of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nrequests the Security Council to take the following \r\nimmediate actions to improve its working methods. It \r\nshould increase the number of public meetings, in \r\naccordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter, and \r\nensure that those meetings provide real opportunities to \r\ntake into account the views and contributions of the \r\nentire membership of the United Nations, particularly \r\nof countries not members of the Council whose affairs \r\nthe Council is discussing. The State concerned should \r\nbe more closely involved in the Council’s discussions \r\nof matters affecting it, in accordance with Article 31 of \r\nthe Charter. The Council should ensure that the views \r\nof Member States, obtained through open, thematic \r\ndebates, are reflected in relevant resolutions and \r\npresidential statements that the Council adopts after \r\nsuch debates, instead of the current practice of \r\nadopting resolutions and presidential statements \r\nwithout reference to such discussions. \r\n The Council should allow briefings by the special \r\nenvoys or representatives of the Secretary-General and \r\nof the United Nations Secretariat to be held in public \r\nmeetings, except in exceptional circumstances. It \r\nshould further strengthen its relationship with the \r\nSecretariat and troop-contributing countries, including \r\nthrough a sustained, regular and timely interaction. The \r\nCouncil should establish its subsidiary organs in \r\naccordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter and \r\nshould ensure that those organs function in a manner \r\nthat provides adequate and timely information on their \r\nactivities to the general United Nations membership. In \r\nthat context, it should guarantee that countries not \r\nmembers of the Council have access to subsidiary \r\norgans, including the right to participate in their \r\ndiscussions, as appropriate. \r\n I would like to conclude by extending our best \r\nwishes for the success of the incoming members of the \r\nSecurity Council: Austria, Japan, Mexico, Turkey and \r\nUganda. The willingness of the countries of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement to engage constructively in \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 14 \r\n \r\nconsultations and negotiations towards democratizing \r\nthe Security Council as an effective organ in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security can \r\nalways be counted on. \r\n Mr. Delacroix (France) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I should like to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Costa Rica, as President of the \r\nSecurity Council, for his comprehensive introduction \r\nof the Council’s annual report to the General Assembly \r\n(A/63/2). My delegation would also like to thank the \r\ndelegation of Viet Nam for its excellent work in \r\npreparing the report. We would like to emphasize the \r\nquality of the report, which we believe meets \r\nlegitimate and well-known expectations. \r\n Equally, I would like to set out France’s position \r\nwith regard to Security Council reform. The President \r\nof our General Assembly has made it one of the \r\npriorities of his mandate. The support of my delegation \r\ncan be counted on to ensure that together we achieve \r\nbold reform of the Security Council, the central \r\ninstitution for United Nations actions in the area of \r\npeace and security. \r\n First, naturally, France remains committed to \r\ncontinued improvement of the Security Council’s \r\nworking methods through enhanced transparency of the \r\nCouncil’s work and better interaction with non-member \r\nStates, without, of course, questioning its autonomy. \r\nFrance is also fully committed to reforming the \r\ncomposition of the Security Council and its \r\ncommitment on that point remains unswerving. As the \r\nPresident of the French Republic said before the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 23 September:  \r\n  “The world of the twenty-first century \r\ncannot be governed with the institutions of the \r\ntwentieth century ... Let today’s major Powers \r\nand the Powers of tomorrow unite to shoulder \r\ntogether the responsibilities their influence gives \r\nthem in world affairs. \r\n  “To all those who are hesitant, I wish to say \r\nthat enlarging the Security Council and the G-8 is \r\nnot just a matter of fairness, it is also a question \r\nof effectiveness. We can no longer wait to turn \r\nthe G-8 into the G14 … \r\n  “Let us act to make our international \r\ninstitutions more representative, because if they \r\nare more representative they will be stronger, more \r\neffective and more respected.” (A/63/PV.5, p. 13) \r\n How do we proceed after so many years of \r\ndiscussions? First, we must bear in mind that the \r\nnecessary expansion of the Security Council must be \r\naimed at strengthening its authority and effectiveness. \r\nThat is why we are in favour of an expansion of the \r\nCouncil in its two categories of membership, with \r\nGermany, Brazil, India and Japan as new permanent \r\nmembers and permanent representation for Africa.  \r\n During the many debates on the topic, a great \r\nmajority of delegations have expressed clear support \r\nfor an expansion of the Security Council in its two \r\ncategories of membership — permanent and \r\nnon-permanent. That point is important and must not \r\nbe forgotten. \r\n The second important point is that we must \r\nacknowledge that, to date, none of the proposals for \r\nfinal reform has gained the approval of two thirds of \r\nthe Member States of the General Assembly, a legal \r\nrequirement well known to all. That is why the idea of \r\ninterim reform to overcome the current impediments is \r\nfinding growing support. As is known, France and the \r\nUnited Kingdom have expressed their readiness to \r\nconsider an interim solution that, without prejudice to \r\nthe end result, would enable us to move forward.  \r\n Specifically, we are open to considering an \r\ninterim solution that could provide for a new category \r\nof seats with a longer mandate than that of the current \r\nelected members, which would be renewable. At the \r\nend of the initial phase, it could be decided to make \r\nthose seats permanent. That option should duly be \r\ntaken into account as part of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, in accordance with paragraph (e) of \r\ndecision 62/577 of 15 September.  \r\n In general, my delegation believes that we should \r\npromptly and fully consider the specific options within \r\nthe framework of the upcoming intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We believe that the decision adopted by \r\nthe General Assembly on 15 September is clear and \r\nimportant.  \r\n We should honour the agreement reached on that \r\noccasion by consensus by the Member States. Its \r\nimplementation will stand as a test of the credibility \r\nand democracy of our Assembly, which we all value. \r\nTogether, we have taken the decision to set out the \r\nframework for our work, the plenary of the General \r\nAssembly, to specify the deadline for opening \r\nintergovernmental negotiations no later than \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n15 08-60760 \r\n \r\n28 February 2009, and to define the basis for the \r\nnegotiations in line with the work conducted thus far. \r\n France will participate in discussions within the \r\nframework of the Open-ended Working Group, which \r\nhas a legitimate place within our joint efforts. At the \r\nsame time, it is understood that the Working Group \r\ncannot stand as a precondition and cannot impose \r\npreconditions on the opening of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, and that conditions may not be imposed, \r\nwhich would run counter to the General Assembly \r\ndecision of 15 September.  \r\n Only in a climate of trust can we progress jointly \r\nand, in that spirit, we support the action of the \r\nPresident of our Assembly. Moreover, we welcome the \r\nmandate that he has entrusted to us and we wish him \r\nevery success. We count on his full involvement to \r\nprovide the necessary drive for our work. Security \r\nCouncil reform is more necessary than ever. Thus, \r\ntogether we must actively continue our efforts by \r\navoiding any step that would lead to procrastination or \r\ndivision within the General Assembly on fundamental \r\nreform of the United Nations. Thus, everyone must \r\nassume their responsibilities. Let us not forget that \r\nreform of the Security Council requires the political \r\ncommitment of the Member States at the highest level. \r\nI have just reiterated our own commitment, and I \r\ncherish the hope that it will be shared by the greatest \r\nnumber of Members possible so as to achieve effective \r\nreform.  \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to express our gratitude to the Ambassador \r\nof Costa Rica for introducing the report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/63/2) covering the \r\nperiod of August 2007 to July 2008. My delegation \r\nalso wishes to associate itself with the statement made \r\nby the Ambassador of Cuba on behalf of the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries. \r\n Following up that work requires the ongoing \r\nattention of the Member States. Therefore, it is \r\nappropriate that the Council retain and further the \r\npractice of organizing briefing sessions so that \r\nnon-member countries may be aware of the work of the \r\nCouncil and its subsidiary bodies. More frequent \r\npresentations of special reports by the Security Council \r\nwould contribute to that goal. \r\n With regard to the content of the report presented \r\non this occasion, we would like to highlight the work \r\nof the delegation of Viet Nam, as President of the \r\nCouncil in July 2008, in drawing up the introduction to \r\nthe document, which outlines the Council’s work. We \r\nalso welcome the initiative of that delegation to inform \r\nnon-Council member States on the process of preparing \r\nthe annual report to the General Assembly. We urge \r\nthat this becomes a regular practice.  \r\n Colombia underscores how important it is that the \r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly \r\nnot be a mere sequence of facts, but include elements \r\nof qualitative and analytical information, such as the \r\ncriteria used by the Council in taking decisions. My \r\ndelegation observes with interest the increase in \r\ninteraction between countries presiding the Security \r\nCouncil and other member States. The briefing \r\nsessions at the beginning of every month, in addition to \r\nproviding indispensable information for keeping \r\nabreast of the issues included in the monthly \r\nprogramme of work of the Council, provide an \r\nopportunity to establish a dialogue and express \r\nconcerns to the country in the presidency. \r\n We are at a moment of great importance in the \r\nhistory of our Organization. After several years of \r\ndebate, next February, pursuant to decision 62/557 \r\nadopted by this Assembly, we will launch a process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to reform the Security \r\nCouncil. We have reached this point thanks to the \r\nconstant work of the Open-ended Working Group on \r\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and \r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council \r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council and \r\nthat of the Presidents of the General Assembly who \r\nhave chaired that Group. We must take this opportunity \r\nto pursue progress, building on what has already been \r\nachieved. The reform process has become imperative in \r\norder to correct the inequities and inefficiencies \r\naffecting the workings of the Council.  \r\n We must strive for a comprehensive reform to \r\nmake the Council a more democratic, representative, \r\ntransparent, efficient and accountable organ. In its \r\ncurrent configuration, the Council does not respond to \r\ntoday’s realities. Thus, the reform should take into \r\naccount not only an increase in the membership and \r\ncomposition of the Council, but also an improvement \r\nin its working methods.  \r\n Colombia believes that only the category of \r\nnon-permanent members should see an increase in \r\nnumbers. Such a reform would be in accordance with \r\nthe purpose of effectively turning the Council into a \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 16 \r\n \r\nmore democratic, representative and transparent organ. \r\nRetaining permanent membership and the related \r\nprivileges that it confers on a few countries would be \r\nto the detriment of the participation of small and \r\nmedium-sized States in the Council. It would also \r\nundermine their ability to influence the decisions and \r\nactions of the Council. It is not consistent to preach \r\ndemocratization of the Council while extending \r\nprivileges to a few States.  \r\n Colombia supports a balanced and fair reform of \r\nthe Council. We envision a Council that is more \r\nequitable in terms of geographical representation, and \r\nin which all States, large, medium or small, and \r\nparticularly those whose interests and hopes have been \r\nunderrepresented, enjoy the same chances of becoming \r\nmembers of that organ. \r\n My delegation believes that it is of paramount \r\nimportance to continue improving the methods of work \r\nof the Council. Any progress in that area must be \r\naimed at greater transparency and more participation \r\nby member States in the activities and decisions of the \r\nCouncil. The Council should hold more frequent open \r\nmeetings, thus allowing greater access to non-member \r\nStates, particularly at meetings dealing with issues that \r\naffect such States directly. A clear and predictable \r\ndecision-making process is also essential to ensuring \r\nthe transparency and legitimacy of the actions of the \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\n Colombia believes that the Council should be \r\nable to avail itself of more democratic decision-making \r\nmechanisms. My country reiterates its historic \r\nopposition to the veto and believes that any reform of \r\nthe Council would be incomplete without a thorough \r\nexamination of options to curtail its use with a view to \r\neventually abolishing it. In that regard, an initial option \r\nwould be restricting its use to situations pertaining to \r\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Another \r\npossibility would be to establish a mechanism to \r\nreduce or neutralize the use of the veto or to increase \r\nthe threshold required for it to take effect.  \r\n The coming weeks will be of great importance for \r\nthe success of the intergovernmental process to start in \r\nFebruary 2009. In this context, we welcome the \r\ndecision taken yesterday to retain the functions of the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group. This is consistent with \r\nthe letter and the spirit of decision 62/557.  \r\n If such processes are to be successful, they must \r\nbe open and inclusive. If our aim is to democratize the \r\nCouncil, we must also employ democratic mechanisms \r\nin the reform process. In that spirit, the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group must undertake a detailed analysis, \r\nincluding the goals of the reform, its guiding principles \r\nand the terms or procedures to be applied. It must also \r\ninclude an agreement on the rules for negotiations, \r\nguaranteeing open, transparent and participatory \r\ndiscussions. At the conclusion of the work undertaken \r\nby the Working Group during this preparatory phase, \r\nwe believe that it would be important for the General \r\nAssembly to adopt a document to serve as a guideline \r\nfor our work. \r\n Lastly, Colombia will continue to promote a \r\nreform of the Security Council that achieves a Council \r\nthat responds to the interests and hopes of the various \r\ncountries and regions of the world in an equitable \r\nfashion. Members can rest assured of our continued \r\nparticipation and support in achieving this goal.  \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): Allow me to start by \r\nexpressing my delegation’s gratitude for the President’s \r\ninitiative to include the reform of the Security Council \r\namong the six main priorities of his presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session and within \r\nhis initiative for the democratization of the United \r\nNations, in particular the Security Council. I would \r\nlike to also express my deep appreciation to Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-second session, for his concerted efforts in \r\npushing forward this important issue, which constitutes \r\nan integral part of the comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n Allow me to also extend our sincere thanks to the \r\nrepresentatives of Bangladesh, Chile, Djibouti and \r\nPortugal for their tremendous efforts in their capacity \r\nas the vice-chairpersons of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security \r\nCouncil during the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n As my delegation stated during our work in the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group and our consecutive \r\ndiscussions of this agenda item in the General \r\nAssembly, United Nations reform will not be complete \r\nwithout achieving Security Council reform in both the \r\nenlargement of its membership and the reform of its \r\nworking methods. Such a reform should be aimed at \r\nrapidly addressing the serious historical injustices \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n17 08-60760 \r\n \r\ncommitted against Africa, due to the lack of its \r\nrepresentation in the permanent membership category \r\nof the Security Council, and the negative impact of the \r\ncontinuation of this situation on the ability of the \r\nCouncil to deal effectively with many of the conflict \r\nsituations in the African continent.  \r\n In this regard, I would like to associate my \r\nremarks with the remarks made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Mauritius, Chair of the African \r\nGroup for the month of November, stressing the \r\nAfrican common position, as outlined in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration, calling for no less \r\nthan two permanent seats, with all the prerogatives and \r\nprivileges of permanent membership, including the \r\nright to veto, and for two additional non-permanent \r\nseats. \r\n There is no doubt that General Assembly decision \r\n62/557, adopted without a vote on 15 September 2008 \r\nupon the recommendation of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup, constituted a breakthrough that was eagerly \r\nawaited by Africa and many other stakeholders — the \r\nagreement to start the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non this important issue during the sixty-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly. In order to ensure the success of \r\nthose intergovernmental negotiations, all of us must \r\nabide by the letter and spirit of the delicate agreement \r\nreached in the decision through difficult negotiations \r\non all procedural and substantive aspects of dealing \r\nwith the issue during the current session. \r\n Speaking of procedural aspects, and specifically \r\nof the timelines indicated in the decision, I am \r\nconfident that we all still remember those long \r\ndiscussions on how to establish the correct balance \r\nbetween the competence of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup vis-à-vis the competence of the General \r\nAssembly in dealing with the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations with a view to ensuring their success. The \r\nagreement on a timeline, as reflected in paragraphs (c) \r\nand (d) of the decision, did not come about in a \r\nvacuum. It came as a result of consultations on an \r\ninitial proposal to start intergovernmental negotiations \r\nnot later than the end of December 2008, which was \r\namended to start those negotiations not later than the \r\nend of April 2009, until we settled on the current \r\nformulation of starting the negotiations not later than \r\n28 February 2009. This indicates that timing in itself \r\nwas an essential and integral factor in achieving this \r\nimportant result.  \r\n The sequence of the paragraphs was another \r\nfactor. Paragraph (c) was initially proposed as \r\nparagraph (f), the second to last paragraph of the draft \r\ndecision, and was intentionally moved through \r\nnegotiations to become (c), just before paragraph (d), \r\nwhich deals with the intergovernmental negotiations, in \r\nclear sequencing that reflects the procedural \r\nprecedence of the work of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup in preparation for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. \r\n From a substantive point of view, this agreement \r\non a specific timeline was closely linked to another \r\nagreement on the substantive side, as reflected in \r\nparagraph (c) of the decision, stating that the Open-\r\nended Working Group would continue to address the \r\nframework and modalities in order to — and I stress \r\nthis — prepare and facilitate the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, and that the Chairman of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group would present the results of these \r\nconsultations to an informal plenary meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly no later than 1 February 2009.  \r\n So we all agreed that the work of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the framework and modalities is \r\nessential to preparing and facilitating our \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Therefore, we do not \r\nsee the need to enter again into a procedural debate on \r\nwhether intergovernmental negotiations could start in \r\nparallel with the work of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup or not. Such a debate would only cast doubts on \r\nthe spirit of good faith and mutual respect that we \r\nagreed to adopt as a basis for our work in paragraph (d) \r\nof the decision and in the United Nations work at large. \r\nTo the contrary, we should allow the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group all the time it needs to consider the \r\nmany issues related to the framework and modalities \r\nand to present its Chairman’s report before the end of \r\nJanuary 2009. \r\n Therefore, we congratulate the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for his wise decision to cancel the \r\nproposed meeting of the informal plenary of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on this issue and to allow full \r\nopportunity to the Open-ended Working Group to \r\nundertake its responsibilities properly. \r\n Turning to the conduct of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, the provisions of paragraph (d) are very \r\nclear. They are: \r\n “to commence intergovernmental negotiations in \r\ninformal plenary of the General Assembly during \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 18 \r\n \r\nthe sixty-third session … based on proposals by \r\nMember States”. \r\n I would emphasize that last part: “based on \r\nproposals by Member States”. We all agreed that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations cannot start unless a \r\nproposal is submitted by a Member State — or a group \r\nof Member States, if they so wish — in clear exercise \r\nof national ownership and full governmental \r\nresponsibility for the proposals, which should reflect \r\nan exclusively governmental point of view, thus \r\nmaking the negotiations truly intergovernmental. This \r\nclearly excludes the possibility of a group of \r\nrepresentatives presenting any proposals in their \r\npersonal capacity, as has happened in the past, or of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly or any of his \r\nfacilitators or vice-presidents presenting a proposal, in \r\nfull recognition of the need to preserve their neutrality \r\nand impartiality and to prevent the utilization of their \r\nhigh offices to advance the positions of one \r\nstakeholder or another. \r\n From Egypt’s point of view, there are many \r\nissues that require consideration in the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group in order to ensure success in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Those include the \r\nconditions required to reach a solution that can garner \r\nthe widest possible political acceptance by Member \r\nStates, as required in paragraph (d) of the decision, \r\nduly taking into account that the language used in that \r\nparagraph is only a part of a wider agreement reflected \r\nin paragraph 4 of the section entitled “Notions on the \r\nway forward” of the report of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on its work during the sixty-first session \r\n(A/61/47(Supp)). That report was approved in its \r\nentirety without a vote, so there was agreement and \r\nconsensus on that part of the report.  \r\n We also considered the relation between this \r\nprovision and the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly that could allow the adoption of a resolution \r\non an issue of such seriousness and importance as the \r\nreform of the Security Council by only a two-thirds \r\nmajority, thus excluding an important third of the \r\nmembership of the Organization. One third of the \r\nmembership could well exceed the membership of a \r\ncomplete regional group, such as the African Group or \r\neven the European continent. \r\n Other issues that require consideration in the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group is how to manage the \r\nnegotiations in the informal plenary meeting, when to \r\nmove from the informal plenary meeting to the formal \r\nplenary meeting, and what the rules are that would \r\ngovern such a move. \r\n Furthermore, the Open-ended Working Group \r\nshould consider the role it will play in full \r\nimplementation of paragraph (f) of the decision to help \r\nachieve general agreement among Member States in \r\nthe consideration of all issues relevant to the question \r\nin a manner that could help the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations achieve their objectives. Those objectives \r\ninclude ensuring that the results of our work will meet \r\nthe acceptance that would ensure easy ratification of \r\nthe required amendments to the Charter. \r\n Improving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil is also a matter of paramount importance. We \r\nhave to continue working on implementing what was \r\nagreed upon in the World Summit Outcome to make \r\nthe Council more efficient, transparent and accountable \r\nand to further enhance its effectiveness and the \r\nlegitimacy and implementation of its decisions. \r\n Africa accords the subject of improving the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council as much \r\nimportance as the enlargement of the Council and is \r\ncertain that both pillars of the reform of the Council \r\nare indispensable to achieving the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. This was reflected in the decision on \r\nthe topic adopted by the African Union Summit in \r\nSharm el-Sheikh in July 2008, when African leaders \r\nmandated a Committee of Ten to address all reform \r\nissues of the United Nations system and present a \r\nprogress report to the next summit, to be held in Addis \r\nAbaba in February 2009. \r\n There has undoubtedly been some improvement \r\nin the working methods of the Council, but these \r\nimprovements are still not enough. Reform of the \r\nSecurity Council’s working methods is inevitable and \r\nshould be based on the need to achieve real balance in \r\npower between members of the Council, particularly \r\nbetween the permanent and non-permanent members. \r\nThe time has also come for agreement on permanent \r\nrules of procedure to replace the current provisional \r\nrules of procedure that have been in force for more \r\nthan 60 years. \r\n We fully associate ourselves with the statement \r\nby the representative of Cuba, who spoke on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). In particular, he \r\nstated that the starting point in reforming the methods \r\nof the Council is that the Council should observe the \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n19 08-60760 \r\n \r\ninstitutional balance laid down in the Charter between \r\nthe principal organs and should refrain from exceeding \r\nthe mandates entrusted to it under the Charter. In this \r\nregard, the Council should cease encroaching on the \r\ncompetence of other principal organs of the \r\nOrganization, particularly the General Assembly and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. \r\n Moreover, Egypt reiterates its support for the \r\ninitiative of the Small Five Group aimed at improving \r\nthe working methods of the Security Council. This \r\ninitiative constitutes an appropriate base for further \r\nefforts seeking to improve the working methods of the \r\nCouncil, particularly by restricting the use of the right \r\nof veto in cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity, until we reach the stage in which this \r\nveto right can be finally abolished. However, until the \r\nveto is eliminated, we reiterate that it should be \r\ngranted to all permanent members joining the Security \r\nCouncil within an expansion plan. \r\n Earlier proposals for improving the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council were submitted by the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement when Egypt was a member of \r\nthe Security Council in 1996 and 1997. Moreover, the \r\nNAM Summit in Havana mandated the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of the NAM countries in New York to \r\nwork on a General Assembly draft resolution giving the \r\nAssembly the right to interfere in cases where the \r\nSecurity Council fails to take action despite a threat to \r\npeace and security owing to a lack of unanimity among \r\nits permanent membership. This comes in conjunction \r\nwith the mandate given to the African Permanent \r\nRepresentatives by the African leaders at the Sharm \r\nel-Sheikh Summit concerning the process of Security \r\nCouncil reform, and that is why Africa insists on \r\nhaving the veto right as one of the main elements of the \r\nreform of the Security Council. \r\n In this regard, I stress that improvement in the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council should not \r\nonly be considered by the Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions, but \r\nalso by the general membership of the Organization. \r\n As we consider the report of the Security Council \r\nto the General Assembly, I would like to thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of Costa Rica for having \r\npresented the report. Last year, Egypt, like many other \r\ndelegations, regretted that the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council lacked analytical depth and had \r\nlimited value added for the membership at large. \r\nExamining this year’s report, we note that it contains \r\nmerely a comprehensive overview of the Council’s \r\nmeetings, activities and decisions. The enumeration of \r\nthe meetings and documentation in the report reflects \r\nthe major role undertaken by the Council in various \r\nfields, namely, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, and so \r\nforth. However, we continue to believe that the report \r\ncould better reflect the Council’s challenges, \r\nassessments and rationale during the reporting period. \r\n In our view, the report should be more \r\nexplanatory as regards the positions taken on the \r\nvarious issues being dealt with in the Council, \r\nincluding the reasons behind the failure or inability of \r\nthe Council to take decisive action in some situations, \r\nparticularly those related to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, and the reasons \r\nbehind the different reactions on the part of the \r\nCouncil, whether they be resolutions, presidential \r\nstatements, press releases or reports, as well as the \r\ncriteria followed and the arguments used by the \r\nCouncil to select its reaction in each case. \r\n In conclusion, I am confident that, under the able \r\nguidance of the General Assembly President and Vice-\r\nPresident Tanin, we will reach an agreement on the \r\nreform and expansion of the Security Council, built on \r\nstrengthening the principles of justice and equality in \r\nrights and obligations, which would enable the \r\nSecurity Council to become a platform for democracy \r\nand transparency in dealing with the cases of Member \r\nStates. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): We welcome the \r\nconvening of this joint debate on the two related \r\nimportant issues. \r\n The annual Security Council report (A/63/2), \r\nwhich was introduced by His Excellency Ambassador \r\nJorge Urbina, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, \r\nin his capacity as President of the Security Council for \r\nthe month of November, is an important component of \r\nthe work of the Council. We thank Ambassador Urbina \r\nfor his presentation of the report. \r\n My delegation also commends the delegation of \r\nViet Nam, which held the presidency of the Council \r\nduring the month of July, on the consultations \r\nconducted with Member States during the preparation \r\nof the report, and we hope that this will continue to \r\nremain the practice in the future. \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 20 \r\n \r\n The report is intended to fulfil the obligations \r\nstipulated under Article 24, paragraph 3, and Article \r\n15, paragraph 1, of the Charter and forms part of the \r\nCouncil’s commitment to promoting transparency and \r\naccountability. \r\n The report illustrates a diverse agenda for the \r\nCouncil. During the period under review, the Council \r\nadopted 58 resolutions and 50 presidential statements. \r\nThis prolific work is commendable. \r\n We recognize, however, the continued need for a \r\nmore comprehensive and analytical report. Such a \r\nreport could facilitate a better and more in-depth \r\nunderstanding of the context, dynamics and nature of \r\nthe issues that fall under the purview of the Security \r\nCouncil. It would also be useful for United Nations \r\nMembers for the report also to include the status of the \r\nimplementation of the Security Council’s decisions. \r\n The urgent need for reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is beyond doubt. The Assembly’s Open-ended \r\nWorking Group has been the primary vehicle for \r\npromoting that objective. Various permutations of \r\nSecurity Council reform have been identified and \r\ndebated. Not least, the modalities for the discussion of \r\nsuch reform have been endlessly deliberated. So much \r\nso that there is very little that is new when it comes to \r\nreform proposals. However, today, we stand at a \r\npotentially crucial juncture. \r\n By next February, an intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation in an informal General Assembly plenary is \r\nset to begin, 45 years since the last reform of the \r\nCouncil in 1963. In sharp contrast, the family of \r\nnations is today marked by greater diversity and \r\npluralism. This and the attendant forces of \r\nglobalization mean that the Security Council is today \r\ngrappling with issues far more complex than ever \r\nbefore — issues that test a common understanding of \r\nwhat constitutes a threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity — issues that demand a Security Council \r\nspeaking with a single voice — and issues that are so \r\nentwined and multifaceted that they require innovative \r\nsolutions other than the tried and tested, including the \r\napplication of “soft power”. \r\n In addressing such challenges, Indonesia is \r\nconvinced of the efficacy of the democratic response. \r\nAt the national level, such a response has placed \r\nIndonesia in a better position to deal with the myriad \r\nchallenges it faces as a nation. At the global level, a \r\ndemocratic response, in the form of a reformed \r\nSecurity Council, offers the promise of a Council able \r\nto act truly on behalf of a United Nations, with \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness. \r\n No single country can work alone and it is \r\nincreasingly evident that even the most powerful ones \r\nfind that comprehensive solutions require that they \r\nwork closely with other nations. There is, thus, a need \r\nfor substantive change in the composition of the \r\nCouncil. This would entail additional members, either \r\nboth permanent and non-permanent, or limited only to \r\nadditional non-permanent members. \r\n What is most important is that the Security \r\nCouncil must be made more representative of the \r\ncontemporary world, its geographic regions and the \r\nrich diversity of its constituencies. \r\n The arguments for a democratic reform of the \r\nSecurity Council are compelling. All of us within this \r\nHall subscribe to the importance of Security Council \r\nreform, yet, as the years of the reform process attest, it \r\nis one thing to agree on the need for reform, and \r\nanother to agree on the nature of the reform. The list of \r\nproposals is extensive and varied, each with its own \r\nstrong proponents pushing for acceptance, even if they \r\npush United Nations unity to a breaking point, not least \r\nof which are proposals which, rather conveniently, \r\nappear to fit the aspirations of their advocates to \r\nCouncil membership. \r\n Indonesia believes that to yield tangible results, \r\nwe must strive to emphasize the collective interests of \r\nMember States, rather than engage in an endless \r\nmutually cancelling pursuit of individual national \r\ninterests. After years of debate within the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group, it may be timely to accentuate \r\nconsensus, where once there was division — to build \r\nbridges. We must seek the common elements in the \r\nvarious proposals that have been offered and recognize \r\nareas where there may be convergence of views. We \r\nshould appreciate parties which have exercised \r\nrestraint in promoting their own national aspirations, \r\nchoosing instead to emphasize the collective interest in \r\nreform of the Security Council. \r\n A perfect solution may be beyond us. However, it \r\nis essential that we strive for the widest political \r\nacceptance possible. Without a real sense of ownership \r\nand representation by Member States, the reform of \r\nthis eminent organ will hardly achieve its stated \r\nobjectives. \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n21 08-60760 \r\n \r\n My delegation is committed to reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. It wishes to position itself as part of \r\nthe solution to the reform process and not to the \r\ncontrary. Agreement must first be obtained on a \r\nreformed Security Council and how a reformed \r\nCouncil would be constituted. The States that are to \r\nserve on such a reformed Council — that is for a later \r\ndecision, democratically decided. \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): First of all, \r\non behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, let me express \r\nour deepest thanks to His Excellency Ambassador \r\nJorge Urbina, the Permanent Representative of Costa \r\nRica and President of the Security Council for \r\nNovember, for presenting to the General Assembly the \r\nreport on the Council’s activities (A/63/2). \r\n My delegation wishes to align itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Cuba on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement on two important \r\nagenda items, relating to the report of the Security \r\nCouncil and the question of equitable representation on \r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters. \r\n It is a fact that the workload of the Security \r\nCouncil is increasing every year. This means that \r\ninternational peace and security remain challenged and \r\nmuch is required of the Council to discharge its \r\nresponsibilities. From a body that formerly met only a \r\nfew times a month, the Council has become a body that \r\nholds hundreds of meetings a year. \r\n During the period from August 2007 to July \r\n2008, the Council held 219 formal meetings and \r\n177 consultations of the whole. On the ground, in \r\naddition to 17 operating missions mandated by the \r\nSecurity Council, the deployment of other \r\npeacekeeping operations, particularly in Africa, is \r\nincreasing in order, to strengthen local peacebuilding \r\nefforts. \r\n While conflicts and deadly violence continue to \r\ntake place in Iraq, Afghanistan, the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories and other regions, not to mention \r\nthe outbreak of new ones in the Balkans and the \r\nCaucasus, United Nations-led peacemaking efforts, \r\nincluding preventive diplomacy and conflict \r\nprevention, have to some extent yielded encouraging \r\ntangible outcomes, helping to strengthen peace and \r\nstability in many countries in various regions of the \r\nworld. \r\n Against this backdrop, we take note of the efforts \r\nmade by the Security Council as well as the Secretariat \r\nto fulfil their work, especially in facilitating the \r\nimplementation of the measures stated in the 19 July \r\n2006 note of the President of the Council (S/2006/507). \r\nAs an advocate of the reforms which would increase \r\nthe efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and \r\ninteraction of the United Nations system, including the \r\nSecurity Council, we are encouraged by the positive \r\ndevelopments to this end, particularly a growing trend \r\ntowards transparency with an unprecedentedly large \r\nnumber of open meetings held by the Council and, \r\nmore than ever before, an active participation by \r\nnon-member States in the Council’s work. \r\n In this regard, Viet Nam welcomes the open \r\ndebate the Security Council held on 27 August 2008 to \r\nexamine how to improve its working methods, as well \r\nas to review efforts to intensify the Council’s \r\nconsultations with the broader United Nations \r\nmembership in its work, including the drafting of its \r\nannual report to the General Assembly. \r\n We are fully convinced that more should be done \r\nto make the Council further accountable for its actions, \r\nas expected by the large membership of the United \r\nNations. As the key part of the renewal of the United \r\nNations system, the reform of the Council should be \r\nfurther expedited, both in terms of its representation \r\nand working methods. \r\n We would like to reiterate our position that a \r\nmodern Security Council must be more representative \r\nand democratic with an enlargement in both permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories of membership. At the \r\nsame time, a greater focus should be placed on \r\nimproving the Council’s agenda, working methods and \r\ndecision-making process. We wish to underline the \r\nview of the Non-Aligned Movement that transparency, \r\nopenness and consistency are key elements that the \r\nCouncil should observe. \r\n To this end, we are in favour of creating more \r\nopportunities for United Nations members to express \r\ntheir views and proposals on issues of which the \r\nCouncil is seized. Frequent consultations with \r\nconcerned parties would also do much to help ensure \r\nthe greatest support for the Council. \r\n However, transparency must not be exercised at \r\nthe expense of overlapping the work of the Council \r\nwith that of other bodies such as the General Assembly, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, the United Nations \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 22 \r\n \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\nand other agencies. This would weaken needed efforts \r\nat coordination. To improve its efficiency, besides \r\npursuing measures to streamline its work, the Council \r\nshould avoid involvement in issues which do not fall \r\nwithin the purview of its mandate as stipulated by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and should devote more \r\neffort to facilitating dialogue and mediation rather than \r\nabusing sanctions by invoking Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter. \r\n It is high time for Member States to begin \r\ngenuine negotiations on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. In support of decision 62/557, adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 15 September, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the determination of the Assembly President \r\nto push ahead the process of Security Council reform at \r\nthe current session. We are convinced that under the \r\nPresident’s wise leadership, the United Nations will \r\nreap fruitful outcomes on the path ahead. We also \r\nextend our support to His Excellency Mr. Zahir Tanin, \r\nPermanent Representative of Afghanistan, as Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. We are looking \r\nforward to working closely with other members of the \r\nUnited Nations in this process. \r\n Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our most profound gratitude for the support of \r\nMember States that we enjoyed in carrying out our \r\nduties as President of the Security Council during the \r\nmonth of July, in particular in the drafting of the \r\ncurrent report of the Council. \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): At the outset, I would like to \r\nthank the President of the General Assembly, for \r\nconvening today’s plenary meeting to discuss the \r\nreport of the Security Council and Security Council \r\nreform. I would also like to extend my appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Jorge Urbina of Costa Rica for \r\nintroducing the report in his capacity as President of \r\nthe Council for November. \r\n I should like to start with Security Council \r\nreform. In order to enhance the functioning, \r\neffectiveness and credibility of the Council, we must \r\nurgently reform its composition to reflect today’s \r\nworld, not the world of yesterday, and to address \r\neffectively the needs of the twenty-first century. To \r\nachieve that goal, it is essential that those countries \r\nwhich bear major responsibility in the implementation \r\nof the decisions of the Security Council for \r\ninternational peace and security should occupy \r\npermanent seats on the Council. I would like to stress \r\nthat the Security Council must be reformed through the \r\nexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories. Only through such reform will the Council \r\nbecome more representative, effective and credible. \r\n The genuine desire of Member States to realize \r\nmeaningful reform of the Security Council was \r\nmanifested in the unanimous adoption of decision \r\n62/557 by the General Assembly on 15 September. I \r\nwelcome this important and historic decision to \r\nadvance the reform process from the stage of \r\nconsultations that had continued for 15 years in the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group to the stage of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations at the informal plenary \r\nof the General Assembly. That decision has clearly \r\ndetermined the course of action on how the \r\nnegotiations will be launched and organized. In line \r\nwith this decision, we should proceed speedily to \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Japan will work \r\nactively and constructively towards achieving \r\nmeaningful reform at the earliest possible date. This \r\nwill garner the widest possible political acceptance. \r\n The functioning of the Security Council should \r\nalso be improved by enhancing its transparency and \r\naccountability.  \r\n The quality of the Security Council’s report this \r\nyear is vitally important. Its work during the reporting \r\nperiod was occupied predominantly by issues in Africa. \r\nThe introduction of the report provides us with a \r\ncomprehensive overview of the Council’s work. The \r\nreport contains descriptions of Council meetings with \r\nthe core message of each briefing and the reaction of \r\nits members. With more detailed information in the \r\nintroduction, we appreciate the effort which has been \r\nmade to present a fair reflection of the Council’s work \r\nand to strike a balance between analysis and \r\ninformation. The report is also candid about what the \r\nCouncil was not able to achieve. It is important that it \r\neffectively address emerging risks and threats to \r\ninternational peace and security and speak in one voice \r\nin such situations. \r\n One of the new developments during the \r\nreporting period is the interaction between the Council \r\nand the Peacebuilding Commission. As the \r\nCommission began its substantive work, its \r\nrelationship with the Council has evolved and practices \r\nhave been established, such as regular communication \r\nbetween the President of the Council and the Chair of \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n23 08-60760 \r\n \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, with the participation \r\nof the chairs of the country-specific configurations in \r\nthe relevant Council meetings. Japan welcomes the \r\nfurther development of such practices and of the \r\nrelationship with the Peacebuilding Commission into a \r\nmore concrete and substantial collaboration to support \r\nthe work of the Council. \r\n Another noteworthy effort was the organization \r\nof the informal meeting on the draft report of the \r\nCouncil before the report was finalized. It was \r\nparticularly useful for the Member States to reflect on \r\nmatters of interest in the process of the preparation of \r\nthe report of the Security Council. I understand that \r\nthis was the first time this kind of consultation with the \r\nwider membership took place in the past decade. We \r\nare very grateful to Ambassador Minh of Viet Nam for \r\nproactively addressing the concerns expressed earlier \r\nby Member States in the annual debate of the General \r\nAssembly. For further progress, I would like to suggest \r\nthat the overview part of the introduction elaborate \r\nbriefly on the changing trends and significant events in \r\nthe work of the Council, any improvement in the \r\nworking methods and discussions on cross-cutting \r\noperational and strategic issues in the Council. \r\n Improving the working methods of the Council \r\ncontinues to be a primary concern for both the Council \r\nand the General Assembly. The adoption of the note by \r\nthe President, contained in document S/2006/507, \r\nwhich my delegation had played a role in preparing, \r\nhelped to make Council members aware of the \r\nresponsibility that membership entails. We saw some \r\nimprovements in this regard. The types of meeting \r\nformats have been clarified and the number of public \r\nmeetings has been substantially increased, in particular \r\nthose with the participation of the countries directly \r\nconcerned. Other efforts have also contributed to \r\nincreased accessibility of timely information for \r\nnon-Council members. \r\n The reports of the Secretary-General have \r\nbecome more concise and we have noted efforts to \r\nclearly indicate observations, recommendations and \r\nlong-term strategies, as appropriate. For the purpose of \r\nsubstantive discussion in the Security Council, the \r\ntimely distribution of the report is critically important. \r\n While these improvements are welcome, some of \r\nthe recommendations contained in the note have not \r\nyet been sufficiently implemented. The open debate of \r\nthe Council on 28 August illustrated the achievements \r\nand shortfalls over the years. We hope the Council will \r\nundertake follow-up efforts to further improve its \r\nworking methods. \r\n In conclusion, Japan, which is soon to become a \r\nmember of the Council, will make every effort to \r\nenhance the accountability and transparency of the \r\nSecurity Council, as well as to advance the process of \r\nSecurity Council reform. \r\n Mr. Wolff (United States of America): On behalf \r\nof the United States, I would like to thank the President \r\nof the General Assembly for helping the Assembly \r\nengage in a constructive dialogue on this important \r\nissue. I would also like to thank the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Jorge Urbina of Costa \r\nRica, for his remarks as President, introducing the \r\nannual report of the Council. This report, which was \r\ncapably drafted by the Vietnamese delegation, to whom \r\nwe convey our gratitude, provides Member States with \r\na transparent and comprehensive review of the \r\nCouncil’s intensive work.  \r\n As called for in decision 62/557, we look forward \r\nto continuing discussions in the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup between now and the end of January so that all \r\nMember States can prepare the path forward for the \r\nlaunch of intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil expansion no later than 28 February 2009. \r\n The United States is open to a modest expansion \r\nof the Security Council. Only an expansion of \r\nrelatively small size will preserve the Council’s ability \r\nto respond quickly, effectively and credibly to threats \r\nto international peace and security. That ability is \r\nessential for the Council to discharge its primary \r\nresponsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, and it must guide our \r\ndiscussions on any Council expansion. \r\n The United States believes that qualified \r\ncandidates for Security Council permanent membership \r\nmust have demonstrated their ability to act as \r\nresponsible stakeholders in addressing global, not just \r\nlocal or regional, challenges to peace and security. \r\nThey must maintain strong commitments to democracy, \r\nhuman rights and non-proliferation and provide \r\nsubstantial peacekeeping or financial contributions to \r\nthe United Nations. As we have stated in the past, we \r\nbelieve Japan is qualified for permanent membership \r\non those grounds, and we are willing to consider other \r\nnations as well. \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 24 \r\n \r\n Although the Charter is clear on the two-thirds \r\nrequirement for amendment of the Charter, we continue \r\nto believe that it is politically wise and important to \r\nachieve the broadest possible support for Council \r\nexpansion to ensure that no significant portion of the \r\nmembership is alienated by the result and that it \r\nconstitutes an improvement over the status quo. For \r\nthat reason, we are pleased that decision \r\n62/557 includes the political goal of a solution that can \r\ngarner the widest possible political acceptance by \r\nMember States. Achieving the widest possible political \r\nacceptance will greatly ease the ratification process by \r\nMember States, including by all of the permanent \r\nmembers of the Council. \r\n The United States strongly believes that any \r\nreform of the Security Council must be undertaken in a \r\nmanner consistent with the provisions of the Charter \r\nand as part of a comprehensive effort to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of the entire United Nations system, \r\nincluding areas that are clearly in much greater need of \r\nreform than the Security Council. A comprehensive \r\npackage must include reforms in other areas, such as \r\nGeneral Assembly financing and decision-making. We \r\nhave yet to see significant movement on those issues, \r\nand we urge that an accelerated parallel process be \r\nstarted that can accompany our efforts related to the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n We look forward to hearing the views of other \r\nMember States and hope that we can all work together \r\nin a collaborative and collegial spirit to move forward \r\nto achieving our shared goal of United Nations reform. \r\n Mr. Haroon (Pakistan): Pakistan welcomes the \r\npractice of holding this joint debate on two interrelated \r\nand important items on the Assembly’s agenda. To \r\nbegin, Sir, let me, through you, congratulate President \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann on assuming the Chair and thank \r\nhim for all his efforts in bringing this matter before the \r\nmembership of the Assembly. Let me also thank \r\nAmbassador Urbina of Costa Rica for presenting the \r\nCouncil’s annual report, and Ambassador Le Luong \r\nMinh of Viet Nam for consulting the general \r\nmembership in July on the draft report. Our \r\nappreciation also goes to Belgium and the S-5 \r\ncountries for the initiative to hold an open debate on \r\nworking methods in the Security Council in August. \r\n With responsibility comes accountability. This \r\ndebate is, first and foremost, a reaffirmation of \r\naccountability of the Security Council to the general \r\nmembership of the United Nations. The purpose of this \r\naccountability is an objective assessment of the \r\nCouncil’s performance in carrying out its primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, a responsibility conferred on it by \r\nthe Member States sitting here and on whose behalf the \r\nCouncil acts. \r\n Not only the Security Council, but also other \r\norgans of the United Nations are required to submit \r\nreports to the General Assembly for its consideration. \r\nThese Charter provisions are but tools for \r\naccountability. But they must not be a once-a-year \r\nphenomenon. In the case of the Security Council, the \r\nCharter also envisaged special reports to the General \r\nAssembly, which, of course, we have not had the \r\nprivilege of receiving. \r\n Since the Security Council is in continuous \r\nsession, the exercise of accountability, we believe, is \r\nalso continuous. This is the reality with which the \r\nCouncil needs to come to terms. Business as usual will \r\ncontinue to erode the Council’s credibility and \r\nlegitimacy. That is also the crux of the effort to reform \r\nthe Council. \r\n Despite its shortcomings, the Council is doing \r\nimportant work in promoting peace and stability in \r\nvarious parts of the world, and Pakistan has made a \r\ntangible contribution to those efforts for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The \r\nCouncil needs to do more to prevent conflict in the first \r\nplace. It needs to devise and implement comprehensive \r\nstrategies and should work more closely with other \r\nUnited Nations bodies, including, specifically, this \r\nAssembly and the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n It is, however, the Council’s poor record in the \r\nhandling of inter-State conflicts that is the object of \r\nmost criticism and the reason for the loss of credibility. \r\nThe Council does not deal directly with some of the \r\nmajor conflicts and threats to international peace, \r\nsecurity and harmony. Some major issues remain \r\nunsolved due to non-implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, such as the Palestinian and the \r\nJammu and Kashmir issues. In the conflicts in the \r\nMiddle East, the Council’s role has been sidelined and \r\nviewed mostly as ineffective and partisan. If the \r\nCouncil were to do its job, it would have no time to \r\neven think of encroaching on mandates and \r\nresponsibilities of other United Nations organs. \r\n A/63/PV.53\r\n \r\n25 08-60760 \r\n \r\n Improvement in the Council’s working methods \r\nand more transparent and democratic decision-making \r\nare long-standing legitimate demands of the entire \r\nmembership of the United Nations. Charter provisions, \r\nsuch as those in Articles 11, 15, 24, 31 and 32, and rule \r\n48 of the provisional rules of procedure, are not being \r\nimplemented. \r\n Determination of the Council’s agenda depends to \r\na large extent on the positions and priorities of the \r\npermanent members and major powers. There is \r\ninaction and delay in the Council, even in the face of \r\nthe most obvious acts of aggression and breaches of \r\npeace. On the other hand, sometimes there is proaction, \r\neven interference, in the internal affairs of sovereign \r\nStates. The Council remains a closed club, controlled \r\nand orchestrated by the few. \r\n Most of the problems of the Council that we seek \r\nto redress through reform are related to the permanent \r\nmembers. I ask delegates here today, will not \r\nincreasing the number of individual permanent \r\nmembers render the Council more ineffective, as the \r\ninterests of a greater number of permanent members \r\nwould then need to be reconciled? I ask whether we \r\ncan address these problems by enlarging the coterie of \r\nthe few or by strengthening the democratic \r\nrepresentation, the role and the influence of the general \r\nmembership in the Security Council. Logically, the \r\nlatter is the right and the only feasible approach. The \r\nmajority of the membership should support this \r\napproach, even though some have been made to believe \r\notherwise and have been asked to state their case in the \r\nname of Council reform. We believe the views of two \r\nspecific groups are inimical and opposed to genuine \r\nreform as envisaged by the Member States. \r\n The first group is that of the permanent members \r\nof the Council who do not want genuine reform and \r\nwho believe in the status quo. In particular, they do not \r\nwant to reform the use of the veto, which over six \r\ndecades has been used for their interests. \r\n The second group is comprised of a handful \r\nof countries whose goal in the reform exercise is \r\nto promote — and rightly so, as far as they are \r\nconcerned — their self-interest. These aspirants to \r\nspecial status and individual privilege in fact want to \r\nbecome permanent members at any cost. Interestingly, \r\nthey are also in the forefront in criticizing the \r\npermanent members, whose power and influence they \r\nclaim to challenge. Paradoxically, however, they crave \r\nto join the same club. It is obvious that the \r\ncompromises and bargains involved in this grand game \r\nwill achieve anything but reform for the Security \r\nCouncil. Indeed, it may be inferred that the ambition of \r\nthis group is in reality to block any substantial reform \r\nof the Council. \r\n But others have moved on and caused their \r\npositions to evolve. Expansion in non-permanent seats, \r\nas we all know, is an option supported by all Member \r\nStates and groups. That reform is among the few \r\nelements on which there is agreement, as noted by the \r\nTask Force. The non-permanent seats provide the \r\nmaximum and the most equitable opportunities for all \r\nMember States for representation on the Council. \r\nMany Member States have also shown interest and \r\nflexibility in exploring new ideas, including \r\nintermediate options involving re-election and longer \r\nterms than the regular two-year terms. \r\n However, an approach which is truly reflective of \r\nnew realities and which carries strong potential in the \r\ncontext of Security Council reform is regional \r\nrepresentation. The Arab States for example call for a \r\npermanent Arab representation in any future expansion \r\nof the Council. The Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC) has demanded that any reform of the \r\nCouncil must ensure adequate representation of its \r\nmember States. \r\n Then we have the African position on regional \r\nrepresentation. While the Group of Four (G-4) \r\ncountries have self-selected themselves, I congratulate \r\nthe African Union in its responsible act for the \r\nselection of Africa’s representatives in the Council. \r\nThe members of the G-4 say that they support the \r\nAfrican position, but why then are they not willing to \r\naccept the same for their own regions? There, the \r\nmembers of the G-4 are asking for permanent seats to \r\nbe allocated to the regions but not for the regions. \r\nSimply put, they want to have seats in the name of the \r\nregions but then occupy those seats themselves.  \r\n No wonder that while Africa is united on its \r\nprincipled position, the approach of the G-4 has created \r\nserious rifts and divisions in Asia, the Group of Western \r\nEuropean and other States and the Group of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States. The Eastern European \r\nGroup, on the other hand, so far without any aspirant \r\nfor permanent membership, is comfortably placed with \r\nits demand for an additional non-permanent seat, which \r\nwill be available for all the countries of that region. I \r\nA/63/PV.53  \r\n \r\n08-60760 26 \r\n \r\ncongratulate the members of that Group as well, for \r\ntheir excellent choice of approach. \r\n We have expressed on earlier occasions our \r\nunderstanding for the principled African position, \r\nwhich is shared by the Arabs and Eastern Europeans. \r\nWe believe that this model of regional representation, \r\nif applied to all other regions, could garner the \r\nreciprocal support of those regions, and thus promote a \r\nfeasible compromise for all. \r\n The challenge is how to reconcile the various \r\npositions. We have always believed that only a \r\nnegotiated solution can muster the widest possible \r\nconsensus required to bring about actual reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. That approach would accommodate \r\nthe interests and positions of all Member States and \r\ngroups, and it would result in a strengthened and more \r\neffective United Nations. \r\n That is why we insist on a step-by-step approach \r\nin accordance with decision 62/557, adopted in \r\nSeptember. To ensure success, we need to lay down the \r\nparameters and ground rules for transparent, open and \r\neffective intergovernmental negotiations. That is a \r\nnecessity and a must. Let me emphasize that that is \r\nwhy the Uniting for Consensus group and others have \r\nproposed that in accordance with decision 62/557, the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group should carry out its work \r\nto address the framework and modalities in order to \r\nprepare and facilitate the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to be held subsequently. We look forward \r\nto engaging with all Member States to successfully \r\ncomplete this important phase in the coming weeks. \r\nHaving participated in the last few meetings held by \r\nthe previous President of the General Assembly, I \r\nwould say to the representative of the United Kingdom \r\ntoday that all members of the Uniting for Consensus \r\ngroup, which has been working for consensus in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, are well aware that we decided to \r\ngo through the process of reaching consensus only \r\nbecause it was in the interest of the membership at \r\nlarge, and because it would be beneficial for the \r\norganization of work to first seek to establish \r\nmodalities that would be likely to bear fruit when \r\nintergovernmental relationships were discussed. \r\n Once the negotiations start in February, we will \r\nparticipate constructively and will make substantive \r\nproposals on all aspects of reform, including working \r\nmethods and expansion of membership. Our proposals \r\nwill be consistent with the objectives of a more \r\ndemocratic, equitably representative, transparent, \r\neffective and accountable Council. They will conform \r\nto the principles of the sovereign equality of States and \r\nequitable geographical distribution. And that is the key \r\npoint. They will be reflective of the diversity and \r\npluralism of the contemporary international \r\ncommunity. We seek a comprehensive reform — not a \r\nquick fix, which some want. \r\n Through negotiations, we shall work for a model \r\nthat is responsive to the substantial increase in the \r\nnumber of developing countries in the United Nations \r\nmembership since the last expansion of the Council in \r\nthe 1960s. The model that we support would contain \r\nsome of the following very important features.  \r\n First, the model would provide for allocation of \r\nseats to correspond specifically with the legitimate \r\ninterest of the vast majority of small and medium-sized \r\nStates in serving as Council members. Secondly, it \r\nwould prioritize regional interests over individual \r\ninterests. Thirdly, it would accommodate the positions \r\nof all Member States and regional and other groupings, \r\nincluding in particular Africa, Eastern Europe and the \r\nOIC/Arab States. Fourthly, the model will seek to build \r\nconsensus within and among regions in order to achieve \r\na stronger and more effective Security Council. Fifthly, \r\nit can have no place, however, for outdated concepts of \r\npermanency, individual privilege and special status. On \r\nthe contrary, it will enhance accountability and accord \r\nprimacy to principles over power.  \r\n This approach represents the only way to restore \r\nthe authority, credibility and legitimacy of the Security \r\nCouncil, which are objectives we must all live up to in \r\nthis process of Security Council reform. It is an \r\napproach that will protect and project and embrace the \r\nfuture for all of our family of Member States, not \r\nthrough the double-speak of diplomacy and never-\r\nnever land, but through the realization of where their \r\nfuture lies. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n"
