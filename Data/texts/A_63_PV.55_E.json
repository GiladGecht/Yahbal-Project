(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Kpotsra \r\n(Togo), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 9 and 111 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/63/2) \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters \r\n \r\n Mr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): More than 60 years have already elapsed \r\nsince the Security Council of the United Nations came \r\ninto existence with a mission of maintaining global \r\npeace and security. But, to our regret, the world has \r\nnever been at peace. In most cases, the Security \r\nCouncil is being used to serve the interests of specific \r\ncountries, disregarding all fundamental principles, such \r\nas respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other countries, which constitute a \r\ncornerstone in international relations. \r\n In today’s world, sanctions and coercive \r\nmeasures are imposed against sovereign States under \r\nthe pretext of conflict resolution and righteous \r\nstruggles to safeguard sovereignty are condemned as \r\nthreats to international peace and security. Abuses of \r\npower by the Security Council, such as dealing with \r\nissues beyond its mandate, have become evermore \r\nserious. Furthermore, the debates over the last 15 years \r\non reform of the Security Council have produced no \r\nresult, due to the serious conflicting views among \r\nMember States, including permanent Council members. \r\nConsequently, Member States have increasingly less \r\nconfidence in the Security Council. \r\n The Security Council should remain the United \r\nNations body responsible for global peace and security \r\nand never be used as a tool to legitimize the pursuance \r\nof strategic interests of certain countries. For that \r\nreason, it is important, first and foremost, to ensure \r\nthat the principle of impartiality is strictly observed in \r\nall activities of the Security Council. Peaceful \r\nsettlement of conflicts through dialogue and \r\nnegotiations among the parties concerned should be the \r\nmain remedy in every case. \r\n Sanctions and coercive measures, such as the use \r\nof force, should be rejected, as they only aggravate \r\nconflicts. That necessitates establishing a mechanism \r\nto make Security Council resolutions effective only \r\nafter endorsement by the General Assembly. The \r\nSecurity Council should not be a court that \r\nunjustifiably handles only developing countries. That is \r\nalso imperative for the democratization of the United \r\nNations and the fair settlement of conflicts. \r\n Secondly, the Security Council should be \r\nreformed as early as possible, given the current rapidly \r\nchanging world situation. In that regard, it is important \r\nto ensure that non-member States of the Council and \r\nother developing countries, which are the \r\noverwhelming majority of the United Nations \r\nmembership, are fully represented. \r\n With regard to expansion of the Security Council, \r\nthe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 2 \r\n \r\nKorea would like to reiterate its consistent position on \r\nfirst enlarging the Council’s non-permanent \r\nmembership, which can be easily agreed, and deferring \r\nenlargement of the permanent category of membership \r\nto a later stage. \r\n Even if the permanent membership is to be \r\nexpanded, a country like Japan, a war-criminal State \r\nthat has not paid for its past crimes but, rather, distorts \r\nits past history of aggression, should never be allowed \r\nto occupy a permanent seat in the Council. \r\n Even today, Japan — far from honestly reflecting \r\non its past crimes against humanity and making sincere \r\nreparations — resorts to despicable acts to seize Tok \r\nIslet, which is a sacred territory of Korea, and \r\nsuppresses the General Association of Korean \r\nResidents in Japan, an organization of overseas Korean \r\ncitizens of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n Worse still, Japan has also attempted to raise \r\nissues irrelevant to world peace and security in the \r\nSecurity Council, such as the so-called abduction issue, \r\nonly evoking the alarm and denunciation of Member \r\nStates, as revealed last June. \r\n If a permanent seat were given to such an \r\nirresponsible and brazen-faced Japan, it would be the \r\nsame as encouraging Japan’s ambition for its old dream \r\nof the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. That \r\nwould be extremely dangerous for the entire United \r\nNations membership. \r\n Last but not least, it is equally important that \r\nSecurity Council reform should encompass measures to \r\nensure transparency in the activities of the Council by \r\nopening informal consultations to the public and \r\nallowing interested countries, including parties to \r\nconflicts, to attend informal meetings. \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea expresses its confidence \r\nthat, under the leadership of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, His Excellency Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, realistic and practical approaches will be \r\ndevised to achieve reform of the Security Council, and \r\nreaffirms its commitment to actively participate in \r\ndeliberations on the reform of the Council. \r\n Mr. Kaiser (Czech Republic): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening this meeting and Ambassador \r\nJorge Urbina, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica \r\nand current President of the Security Council, for his \r\ndetailed presentation of the annual report of the \r\nCouncil (A/63/2). That report testifies to the enormous \r\nworkload on that key body of the United Nations, \r\nstemming from its mandate to maintain global peace \r\nand security. The Czech Republic acknowledges all the \r\nefforts that are being undertaken to bring peaceful \r\nsolutions to various conflicts in many regions of our \r\nworld today. \r\n I would like to use this opportunity to share some \r\nthoughts of the Czech delegation concerning Security \r\nCouncil reform. We believe that that subject should be \r\nconsidered one of the priorities of the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly. After many years of \r\npreparatory discussions, the time has come to move \r\nthat agenda forward. Let us therefore fully implement \r\ndecision 62/557 that has finally opened the door for a \r\nmeaningful intergovernmental process. That unanimous \r\ndecision is binding on all of us. From that perspective, \r\nwe have taken due note of the plans recently \r\nannounced by the President of the General Assembly. \r\n There is no doubt that the main task today is to \r\nlaunch the intergovernmental negotiations that will \r\neventually lead to a reform of the Security Council that \r\nwill adapt it to the new realities of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, while safeguarding its effectiveness and \r\nfunctionality. Only by so doing will we truly \r\nimplement decision 62/557. There is absolutely no \r\nreason for any further delays, nor any need to spend \r\nmuch time on preparatory work, since the format and \r\nmodalities of the intergovernmental process are well \r\ndefined by that same decision 62/557, namely, an \r\ninformal plenary of the General Assembly with its \r\nrules of procedures. Subsequently, the basis of the \r\nnegotiations consists of all proposals submitted so far \r\nby all Member States and groupings. \r\n The Czech delegation is convinced that under the \r\nable leadership of Ambassador Tanin we will proceed \r\nquickly, while preserving the basic principles of \r\ntransparency, openness and inclusiveness that are \r\nabsolutely indispensable to maintain the confidence \r\nand active participation of each and every Member \r\nState of the United Nations interested in the reform \r\nprocess. Our delegation is ready to participate in an \r\nopen and cooperative spirit. At this juncture, we do not \r\nwant to pre-empt the outcome of the future \r\nnegotiations. At the same time, we believe that any \r\nreasonable reform of the Security Council should lead \r\nto an expansion of its membership in both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories and make \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n3 08-60935 \r\n \r\nit more equitable. It should also take into account the \r\nlegitimate ambitions and needs of small and mid-sized \r\ncountries. \r\n The previous 15 years of thorough debates should \r\nnot be lost. Undoubtedly, the deliberations of the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council \r\nReform have created a solid platform on which we can \r\nbuild. Thus, it has fulfilled its mandate. However, none \r\nof its future activities should block or slow down the \r\nproceedings in the next phase, namely, the \r\nintergovernmental process. There is no reason for \r\ncreating any preconditions on the upcoming \r\ndeliberations of the General Assembly.  \r\n Over recent months, the determination of the vast \r\nmajority of Member States to make a decisive step \r\nforward has been echoed again and again. The \r\nchallenges of today’s world require us to create a \r\nstronger and more representative and effective United \r\nNations system, including the Security Council. That is \r\na task given to us by our political leaders at the 2005 \r\nSummit. The Czech Republic is ready to work hard \r\ntowards that goal. Let us start sooner rather than later. \r\n Mr. Swe (Myanmar): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank the Permanent Representative of Costa Rica \r\nfor introducing the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/63/2). \r\n Under Article 24, paragraph 1, of the Charter, \r\nStates Members of the United Nations confer on the \r\nSecurity Council the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nagree that, in carrying out its duties, the Council acts \r\non their behalf. The Security Council is accountable to \r\nthe General Assembly and the annual report represents \r\nthe fulfilment of that important Charter obligation. The \r\nreport indicates that the Council had yet another year \r\nof intensive work. \r\n The principal approach of the report remains \r\nsimilar to that of last year. The report is informative, \r\nbut not analytical. While we value the information \r\nprovided in the report, we consider that the Security \r\nCouncil should strive for a report that goes beyond the \r\nlisting of its activities and meetings. \r\n The Security Council is entrusted with the vitally \r\nimportant responsibility of maintaining international \r\npeace and security, and the decisions that it makes \r\nimpact on millions of people around the world. That \r\nunderscores the urgency of reforming the Council, so \r\nthat it can meet the challenges of a new era. The debate \r\non the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters is taking place with that sense of \r\nurgency. \r\n The question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council has \r\nbeen on our agenda for some time. However, our \r\ncollective efforts in the Working Group established \r\nunder General Assembly resolution 48/26 have not \r\nborne fruit.  \r\n We share the view that reform of the Council \r\nmust be an integral part of the ongoing reform process \r\nof the United Nations and that the reform of the United \r\nNations will remain incomplete without an actual \r\nreform of the Council. It must be stressed that any \r\nreform of the Council will be meaningless if the \r\nrestructured Council does not become more \r\nrepresentative, more effective and more transparent in \r\nits decision-making process. \r\n Momentum for reform of the Security Council \r\nwas given a shot in the arm by the 2005 World Summit. \r\nExpectations were raised with regard to the prospect of \r\nreaching agreement on a formula that would garner the \r\nwidest possible support. Subsequently, positive \r\ndevelopments have emerged from consultations. The \r\nimportant role of the Open-ended Working Group on \r\nSecurity Council Reform as the most appropriate \r\ndemocratic forum was reaffirmed. Accordingly, the \r\nWorking Group was mandated to continue its work. \r\nFurthermore, the General Assembly also agreed to \r\nlaunch an intergovernmental negotiation process on \r\nCouncil reform (decision 61/561). The momentum \r\ngenerated during the sixty-first session was maintained \r\nby the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsecond session. \r\n Regrettably, all subsequent attempts have not \r\nresulted in significant headway, due to entrenched \r\npositions. We are discouraged by the conclusion of the \r\ntask force that there is insufficient support for \r\nlaunching the intergovernmental negotiations. It is \r\nclear from this conclusion that flexibility and \r\ncompromise will be required of the major interest \r\ngroups if the discussions on Council reform are to \r\nmove forward. Such flexibility and compromise will be \r\npossible only with a renewed demonstration of political \r\nwill. \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 4 \r\n \r\n The outcome of the present stage of the \r\ndiscussions on the question of Security Council reform \r\ndemonstrates that we will not be able to overcome the \r\npresent impasse. As was the case in discussions on \r\nCouncil reform in the past years, the category of \r\nmembership is the most challenging. The Council’s \r\nmembership must therefore be expanded in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories to reflect the \r\npresent reality and to strengthen the legitimacy of the \r\nCouncil’s decisions.  \r\n The expansion of the Council must take into \r\naccount the need for representation of developing \r\ncountries, which are currently underrepresented in the \r\nCouncil. The representation of African countries must \r\nalso be adequately addressed. At the same time, the \r\nCouncil’s agenda, procedures and working methods are \r\nequally important in making the Council more \r\ntransparent and democratic.  \r\n In connection with the Council’s agenda, we are \r\nparticularly concerned by the failure of the Council to \r\nstrictly adhere to the provisions of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Non-Aligned Movement, which \r\nrepresents the overwhelming number of the \r\nmembership of the United Nations, has stressed on \r\nmany occasions that the Council’s decision to initiate \r\nformal and informal debates on the situation in any \r\nMember State or any matter that does not constitute a \r\nthreat to international peace and security is contrary to \r\nArticle 24 of the Charter.  \r\n Reform of the Council’s procedures and working \r\nmethods must be aimed at promoting transparency and \r\naccountability in the Council’s treatment of issues of \r\ninterest to Member States. The Council’s lack of \r\nwillingness to hold open debates on such issues and its \r\nrestriction on participation in their consideration are at \r\nodds with Article 31 of the Charter, under which any \r\nUnited Nations member may participate in any Council \r\ndebate on issues that it considers affect it. \r\n To promote greater transparency and \r\naccountability, the rest of the Member States should be \r\nafforded more opportunities to engage in the \r\nsubstantive work of the Council. My delegation \r\nconsiders that continued improvement in the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council should not be held \r\nhostage to progress on the issues of membership \r\nexpansion and representation. In that regard, we should \r\nstrive for more progress. \r\n The continued impasse on the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform is highly lamentable. It \r\nnegatively reflects on the United Nations system as a \r\nwhole. As the Working Group stated, a realistic \r\napproach is the only way forward. Compromise and \r\nflexibility on all sides are essential if we are to \r\novercome the deadlock.  \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, the heads of State \r\nand Government expressed support for the early reform \r\nof the Security Council as an essential element of the \r\noverall reform of the Organization. It is incumbent on \r\nus to continue to work for an overall agreement, based \r\non the progress achieved so far, in a spirit of \r\ncooperation and accommodation. The momentum that \r\nhas been generated must be maintained. My delegation \r\nwill continue to support the President’s efforts to move \r\nthe present discussions forward. \r\n Mr. Nhleko (Swaziland): I have the utmost \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland on agenda item 111, entitled, “Question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”.  \r\n At the outset, my delegation wishes to align itself \r\nwith the statement delivered at the 53rd meeting by the \r\nChair of the Group of African States, Mauritius. \r\n The subject before us is of long standing. A lot of \r\neffort has been expended, but we still fall short of a \r\nconclusive resolution. While we agree on accelerated \r\ntalks and negotiation on the matter, regrettably our \r\nwords are not matched by actions. The stakes have \r\nlong been laid and we need to move with urgency, \r\nsince the democratization of the Security Council has \r\nbeen very inconsequential. \r\n It would be unbecoming of me, at the early stages \r\nof my address, if I did not reaffirm and recapture the \r\nprinciples and intents of the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration, which remain beacons of hope \r\nfor Africa and, by extension, for my own country. \r\nNobody needs a reminder of what is contained in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus, and we will not tire in our efforts \r\nto fight for justice characterized by equitable \r\ngeographical representation in the Security Council. \r\nThe status quo does not inspire confidence in the \r\nUnited Nations as a credible body that shelters the \r\nweak and the unfortunate. \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n5 08-60935 \r\n \r\n The principles of Ezulwini are very compelling to \r\nthe African cause. This is by no means a ploy to avoid \r\nbeing realistic. The truth of the matter is that the \r\npresent regime is surreal. The Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on Security Council Reform has been \r\nconstituted since 1994. My delegation reaffirms its \r\nunwavering support for the Working Group. Its report \r\nmakes it succinctly clear that the Security Council \r\nshould be reformed to ensure that it better represents \r\nthe world of today. That premise is a good one for \r\nnegotiations, as some of the Permanent Five can attest.  \r\n The intergovernmental process should be \r\nundertaken without delay. It is encouraging that the \r\nWorking Group has identified some common elements. \r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to express its desire \r\nto hammer away at such commonalities so that we \r\nmove quickly to negotiate on the more difficult ones. \r\nFor this, we support the efforts of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to implement a strategy of \r\naggregation to simplification in the areas of categories \r\nof membership, extent of expansion, regional \r\nrepresentation and the right of veto. \r\n We seek not only structural reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, but also reform of the Council’s working \r\nmethods, which should demonstrate the virtues of \r\ntransparency, fairness and participation by the \r\nmembership. This reform should be undertaken in \r\npartnership with the Security Council body set up for \r\nthat purpose. \r\n The “no reform” option is actually not an option \r\nat all. Member States should carry this agenda forward \r\nas a way to vindicate the United Nations as a just and \r\naltruistic body. Failure to act will project injustice, \r\nimpotency and parochialism far into the future. We \r\nmust remain firm in our determination to keep the \r\nagenda moving forward. \r\n Africa has a commanding oversight regarding the \r\nselection and allocation of the two permanent seats. \r\nThis is true to the virtues of the propensity to collective \r\naction and justifiable distribution. \r\n I conclude by giving prominence to the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration, as both are \r\ncredible springboards for Africa to achieve greater, and \r\njustifiable, leverage in its quest for justice in the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Mr. Menon (Singapore): The annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council that we have before us (A/63/2) \r\nprovides a good overview of the scope and volume of \r\nissues dealt with by the Council in the past year. We \r\nwould like to commend Viet Nam for its consultative \r\nefforts in drafting the expanded introductory section of \r\nthe report.  \r\n Today’s debate allows us to discuss the priorities \r\nand challenges facing this important organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. At the same time, we also sense a \r\nrenewed interest on the part of the wider membership \r\nin Security Council reform following the September \r\ndecision by the General Assembly to commence \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on this long-standing \r\nquestion. \r\n What matters most to small States like Singapore \r\nare the Council’s effectiveness and transparency and its \r\ninvolvement of non-Council members on issues of \r\ndirect concern to them. As a member of the Group of \r\nFive Small States (S-5), Singapore believes strongly \r\nthat the Security Council must improve its working \r\nmethods in order to make the Council more accessible \r\nand, by extension, more effective. We welcome the \r\nincrease in public meetings and improved access over \r\nthe past year.  \r\n But much more needs to be done to enhance the \r\nCouncil’s transparency and accountability. At present, \r\nStates that are directly involved in the various issues \r\naddressed by the Council do not always have the \r\nopportunity to express their views in Council meetings. \r\nAnd even when it is decided that meetings will be open \r\nto the wider membership, those decisions often come \r\nso late that many States are unable to prepare and make \r\nsubstantive contributions. \r\n Last Tuesday, during the meeting of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council Reform, the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly spoke about the \r\nvery first meeting of the Security Council, on \r\n17 January 1946, which was held at Church House, \r\nLondon. What the President did not say, and which \r\nmight come as a surprise to many of us in this \r\nAssembly, is that the first meetings of the Council were \r\nin fact held in the open and on record, with reports of \r\nthe frank exchanges available for all to read. It is said \r\nthat there was so much transparency at that first \r\nmeeting that the representative of the United Kingdom, \r\nwithout realizing that his microphone was switched on, \r\nwas heard to complain, “That bloody Chairman has \r\ndouble-crossed me again!” It is therefore disheartening \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 6 \r\n \r\nto see how much the Council has regressed since its \r\nearly days. \r\n Moving on to the broader question of Security \r\nCouncil reform, we realize that progress has been \r\ndifficult because of the divergent interests, aspirations \r\nand objectives of the United Nations membership. The \r\nSeptember decision by the General Assembly to \r\ncommence intergovernmental negotiations was a finely \r\nbalanced but fairly positive outcome. We can \r\nappreciate the ambivalence with which some Members \r\nStates might participate in discussions on Council \r\nreform. However, my delegation shares the view of \r\nMember States that see today’s discussion, the \r\nmeetings of the Open-ended Working Group and \r\ninformal plenary meetings to be held in the future as \r\nopportunities to move forward on this matter. Most of \r\nus agree that the status quo is unacceptable. I hope that \r\nwe can work together in a pragmatic and realistic \r\nmanner to achieve meaningful progress on Security \r\nCouncil reform. \r\n Singapore’s position on this subject is well \r\nknown. We have articulated our position on various \r\noccasions, and I will not dwell too much on the details. \r\nWe believe that reform of the Security Council is \r\nneeded in order to strengthen the United Nations as an \r\norganization and to better reflect geopolitical realities. \r\nThe choice is clear: either we reform to forestall crises, \r\nor we wait for crises to force change on us. In this \r\nregard, we have consistently voiced our support for an \r\nexpansion of seats in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. As I said at the beginning, \r\nas a member of the S-5, we feel that any reform should \r\ninclude working methods. After all, if the Council’s \r\nworking methods remain questionable, it does not \r\nmatter whether it has 5, 25 or 100 members. \r\n For small States like Singapore, reform is also \r\nabout making the Security Council more representative \r\nof the Organization’s membership. The President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has spoken of the democratization \r\nof the United Nations being his number-one priority. I \r\nam sure that everyone here has seen his banner, which \r\nreads “Towards the Democratization of the United \r\nNations — Every Country Counts”. If we are serious \r\nabout turning this rhetoric into reality, we have to \r\nensure that the views and interests of all of us, in \r\nparticular the small States, are taken into account in the \r\nreform of the Security Council.  \r\n I heard some parties argue — I must say rather \r\ndisingenuously — during the meeting of the Open-\r\nended Working Group last Tuesday that a majority is \r\ndefined by total population. But I would remind this \r\nbody that we are all Member States of this \r\nOrganization. It is the small States, while modest in the \r\nsize of their populations, that make up the majority of \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. Therefore, it is \r\ncrucial to ensure that small States are not \r\ndisadvantaged in any reform arrangement. With this in \r\nmind, I would like to make the following four points. \r\n First, in any expansion of the Security Council, \r\nthere should be more non-permanent seats, to provide \r\nmore opportunities for small States to serve on the \r\nCouncil. That is an important aspect of making the \r\nCouncil more reflective of the views of the \r\nmembership. Small States have few opportunities to \r\nserve regularly on the Council. Indeed, many have \r\nnever served even a single term since becoming United \r\nNations members. I stress this point because all too \r\noften the discussions on reform revolve around the \r\ninterests of the larger and medium-sized Powers. We \r\nshould not forget that small States have made valuable \r\nand constructive contributions during their stints as \r\nnon-permanent members. Likewise, any increase \r\nshould accurately reflect geographic distribution. We \r\ncannot have any one region dominating the \r\nnon-permanent seats. \r\n Secondly, there have recently been proposals to \r\ncreate a new, intermediate category of long-term \r\nrenewable or re-electable seats. Again, this idea sounds \r\nlike one that caters more to the larger and medium-\r\nsized countries. As I stated previously, Singapore’s \r\npreferred option is to expand both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. But if there ever is \r\nwidespread support for going down the path of creating \r\nrenewable or re-electable seats, that approach would \r\nhave to be accompanied by measures like a “time-bar” \r\nto prevent larger and medium-sized countries from \r\nflip-flopping easily between the traditional \r\nnon-permanent category and any new, intermediate \r\ncategory, to the detriment of small States.  \r\n Singapore sees no reason why any country should \r\nhave two bites of the cherry. In other words, once a \r\ncountry declares its decision to run for a seat in the \r\nintermediate category, and regardless of the outcome of \r\nthat election, it should be precluded from running for a \r\ntraditional two-year non-permanent seat for a certain \r\nnumber of years afterwards. Likewise, a country \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n7 08-60935 \r\n \r\nrunning for a two-year non-permanent seat should be \r\nbarred from running for a renewable seat for the same \r\nperiod.  \r\n Without such restrictions, many small States may \r\nwell get the short end of the stick, since it is usually \r\nthe larger countries that have the resources to run \r\nconsecutive or concurrent campaigns. We must ensure \r\na fair playing field for all Member States. The right to \r\nserve on the Council cannot be restricted to only larger \r\nand medium-sized countries. \r\n Thirdly, any reform arrangement should strike a \r\ngood balance between the size and effectiveness of the \r\nSecurity Council. Members often ask whether we can \r\nenlarge the Council without making it more unwieldy. \r\nFor balance and thoroughness, why not consider the \r\nflip side? Can we improve the existing Council \r\nstructure by reforming both categories of its current \r\ncomposition? As the Ambassador of Costa Rica said in \r\nhis statement at the Open-ended Working Group \r\nmeeting last Tuesday, we might want to ask ourselves \r\nwhether the current composition of the Security \r\nCouncil, especially in the permanent category, reflects \r\ntoday’s geopolitical realities.  \r\n Perhaps it might be worthwhile, as part of our \r\nongoing exercise, to take a more clinical approach. We \r\nmay want to go back to first principles and consider \r\nhow best to reflect current geopolitical realities within \r\nthe composition of the Council’s permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership. Maybe we need to \r\nundertake some fundamental restructuring of the \r\nCouncil’s composition — let me assure you that I am \r\nnot here to speak heresy. The broader point I am trying \r\nto make is that we should leave no stone unturned in \r\nour deliberations if we are to seek the most optimal \r\nsolution in this quest for reform. \r\n Fourthly, there is the question of the veto. We \r\nremain opposed to granting the veto to any additional \r\nmembers. It will only complicate decision-making and \r\nincrease the chances of gridlock in the Security \r\nCouncil. That said, we also recognize that the \r\npermanent five will not readily give up their right to \r\nveto. But one cannot be overly pragmatic; we simply \r\ncannot avoid addressing the issue of the veto in any \r\nreform arrangement. \r\n If the Council’s permanent members will not give \r\nup their veto then, as a start, they should exercise \r\nleadership by agreeing to withhold the veto when \r\nconsidering compelling cases, such as instances of \r\ngenocide or ethnic cleansing. At the minimum, they \r\nshould be prepared to explain any use of the veto to the \r\nother Member States. After all, there should be no \r\nprivileges without responsibilities. \r\n My aim today was to highlight some long-\r\nstanding concerns that are shared by Singapore and \r\nother small States. As a small country, Singapore has \r\nno aspirations for permanent membership. However, \r\nwe are mindful of the interests of small States. We \r\nwould like to reiterate that Security Council reform \r\ncannot only serve the interests of the larger and \r\nmedium Powers. The views and interests of small \r\nStates, which make up the majority of the United \r\nNations, must also be taken into account. Otherwise, \r\nthere will be little progress on this issue. \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands): I thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening this \r\nplenary meeting. I would like to join others in thanking \r\nAmbassador Jorge Urbina of Costa Rica, current \r\nPresident of the Security Council, for presenting the \r\nCouncil’s informative report (A/63/2). My delegation \r\nwelcomes the discussion on this document. \r\n It is hoped that in the face of today’s global \r\nfinancial and climate change crises, the Council will \r\nalso look at their security implications. As stated in the \r\npast, the Security Council must be proactive and place \r\nemerging threats on its agenda. \r\n In the past, the scarcity of water and the failure of \r\nagriculture, as well as droughts and other natural \r\ncalamities, has forced people to migrate. For small \r\nisland developing States such as mine, migratory \r\nmovement from low-lying islands to larger islands is \r\nalready happening. The threat of conflict is real as \r\npeople leave their ancestral land to go to completely \r\nnew settings under a different land tenure system and \r\ninto another ethnic domain. \r\n Solomon Islands is a country of half a million \r\npeople speaking some 87 different languages. Other \r\nlow-lying countries in our region are already \r\ndiscussing, at the presidential level, moving to a third \r\ncountry. In this context, we must not address these \r\nissues only from the development perspective, but also \r\nfrom a security angle. The Pacific island States will be \r\nsubmitting a draft resolution along those lines as we \r\nbelieve that these threats could worsen if left \r\nunaddressed. \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 8 \r\n \r\n In our opinion, the financial crisis will have an \r\nimpact on official development assistance. Poverty is \r\nthe root cause of much of today’s conflict. President \r\nLula da Silva once said that peace cannot rise from the \r\nashes of poverty and that no amount of peacekeeping \r\nwill bring peace if the marginalized and the most \r\nvulnerable remain unattended. We have seen billions of \r\ndollars made available to stabilize the financial crisis \r\nand hope, from a security perspective, a stimulus \r\npackage could be directed to the least developed \r\ncountries and small island developing States. \r\n The issue of Security Council reform has become \r\nimportant as a matter of preserving international peace \r\nand security. However, we are mindful that the issue \r\nhas been discussed for the last 15 years. As my \r\ndelegation stated recently at the second Open-ended \r\nWorking Group meeting, the road to reforming our \r\nSecurity Council has been marked by so many twist \r\nand turns that we have measured the journey in terms \r\nof the countless meetings of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup, convened to justify reforms, while not actually \r\nhaving carried out these reforms. \r\n Over the years we have stated and restated our \r\nposition on Security Council reform. Since 2005, we \r\nhave also seen interest groups pronouncing themselves \r\non Security Council reforms; hence we will not discuss \r\nsomething that is already common knowledge. \r\n The unanimous decision of 15 September 2008, \r\nmandating the commencement of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations before 28 February 2009 (decision \r\n62/557), brings a sense of direction. My delegation is \r\nparticularly pleased with and supportive of the \r\ncommitment of the President, Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, to launching the long-awaited \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. That decisive action \r\ndemonstrates true leadership which we commend and \r\nwould like to build on. \r\n Within the recent Open-ended Working Group, \r\nmy delegation expressed concern about seeing a debate \r\non the varying interpretations of decision 62/557. My \r\ndelegation hopes that, under the President’s leadership, \r\nthe eagerness of the Assembly to reform one of the \r\nprincipal organs of our institution will be evident. My \r\ndelegation is pleased to hear from the opening \r\nstatement yesterday, that the President will soon \r\npresent a working plan for the Working Group to \r\ncommence its work. We hope not to get bogged down \r\nwith procedural matters in this process. \r\n Since our leaders spoke on the subject, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has spearheaded a number of \r\nreforms in recent years and we hope that Security \r\nCouncil reform will be accomplished in a similar \r\nmanner. The reform process will be conducted through \r\nthe informal plenary of the General Assembly and \r\nwithin the Assembly’s rules of procedures to ensure \r\nthat transparency, accountability and inclusiveness are \r\nmaintained throughout the process.  \r\n Allow me to conclude by congratulating \r\nAmbassador Tanin on his appointment as Vice-Chair of \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group and of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. My delegation assures \r\nthe President and his facilitator of our support and \r\ncooperation as we continue to look to them for firm \r\nand clear leadership in this important matter. \r\n Mr. Ettalhi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like, on behalf of the \r\nmembers of the League of Arab States, to congratulate \r\nthe President of the General Assembly on this \r\nsuccessful debate on two important items we have been \r\nstudying for several years. Our consideration of these \r\nitems stems from our interest in finding an outlet that \r\nwould lead to Security Council reform which is a sine \r\nqua non for overall United Nations reform. \r\n The League of Arab States welcomes the \r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/47) especially as concerns the \r\ninitiation of intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n In this connection, the Arab League emphasizes \r\nthe need to render these negotiations open, inclusive \r\nand transparent. They should take into consideration \r\nthe positions of all Member States and regional groups.  \r\n Member States deployed considerable efforts \r\nduring the previous General Assembly session to bring \r\nabout concrete progress in Security Council expansion \r\nand reform within the framework of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the \r\nSecurity Council. At the end of the session, decision \r\n62/557 was adopted which reflects a consensus among \r\nMember States that intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nthe matter should start no later than February 2009.  \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n9 08-60935 \r\n \r\n The Working Group was entrusted with looking \r\ninto methods for preparing for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, their facilitation and the submission of a \r\nreport to an informal General Assembly meeting no \r\nlater than 28 February 2009. \r\n The Arab States underscore their commitment to \r\nconstructive cooperation with all parties towards \r\nSecurity Council reform in order to make that body \r\nmore consistent with today’s realities, and hence, better \r\nable and more effective in carrying out its role in the \r\narea of the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, as enshrined in the Charter. \r\n Once again, the Arab States stress the unified \r\nArab position calling for permanent Arab \r\nrepresentation in an expanded Security Council, as \r\nmentioned in a letter dated 13 June 2008 addressed by \r\nthe Chairperson of the Arab Group for the month of \r\nJune to the President of the Security Council. This \r\nletter, contained in the report of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the \r\nSecurity Council (A/62/47), states the Arab Group’s \r\nview that Security Council reform should include true \r\nreform through the Council’s modus operandi, \r\nrespecting transparency and openness in the Council’s \r\nactivities and proceedings. \r\n The reform process should bring about the \r\nparticipation of non-Council members, particularly \r\nthose countries that are directly concerned with issues \r\nunder discussion, as set out in Article 31 of the Charter. \r\nInformal, closed consultations should be limited, and \r\nmore open discussions should be available to increase \r\ntransparency rather than restrict participation by \r\nMember States. More inclusive briefings for \r\nnon-Council members should also take place. \r\n With regard to the item entitled “Report of the \r\nSecurity Council”, the Arab Group expresses its \r\nappreciation for the initiative of the delegation of Viet \r\nNam to hold an inclusive briefing for Member States \r\non the report before its submission. At the same time, it \r\nbelieves that the report before us today (A/63/2) does \r\nnot give a clear picture of what is transpiring in the \r\nCouncil. Nor does it reflect the Council’s commitment \r\nto the content of General Assembly resolutions, in \r\nparticular as regards avoiding the narrative aspect and \r\nincluding in the report an analysis of the reasons that \r\nprompted the Council to adopt such resolutions as well \r\nas the various positions of States, especially the \r\npermanent members, and the reasons standing between \r\nthe Council and its taking decisive positions related to \r\nimportant issues, such as the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n We hope that the future reports of the Security \r\nCouncil will be more useful and incorporate the \r\ndetailed reasons that prevent the Council from carrying \r\nout its mandate in the area of the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security in certain regions. By \r\nthe same token, we hope that the General Assembly \r\nwill take timely action to make up for the Council’s \r\noccasional impotence, given the occasional use or \r\nthreat of use of the veto. \r\n Mr. Argüello (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nthank the representative of Costa Rica, who holds the \r\npresidency of the Security Council for the month of \r\nNovember, for presenting the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council, contained in document A/63/2. \r\n As we can see from the report, the Security \r\nCouncil had another year of intense activity, in which \r\nmany of the topics on its agenda continued to occupy a \r\nprominent place in their work programme over several \r\nyears. It is not the intention of the Argentine delegation \r\nto examine the work of this body in detail, but we do \r\nwish to stress our concern due to the worsening \r\nsituation in intra-State conflicts, which take place \r\nmostly in regions distant from development, with great \r\ninstitutional fragility. In this sense, I am saddened to \r\nreport that, although last year at this same podium I \r\nreferred to the situations in Darfur, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Somalia, those situations \r\ncontinue to be desperate. \r\n For this reason, we stress that, faced with the \r\ndanger of repeated genocide, ethnic cleansing and \r\ncrimes against humanity, Member States have the \r\nresponsibility to protect populations from these \r\natrocities when the State that is under the obligation to \r\ndo so cannot do so or does not have the will to comply \r\nwith its obligations. In this sense, we reaffirm our \r\ncommitment and support for the International Criminal \r\nCourt which will ensure that those responsible for \r\natrocities do not go unpunished. That is why we \r\nencourage those States that have not yet done so to \r\nsign and ratify the Rome Statute. \r\n Furthermore, we understand that conflicts \r\nbetween States call for renewed efforts for peace \r\nwithin the framework of international and humanitarian \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 10 \r\n \r\nlaw. We call on the parties involved to make \r\nsubstantive progress directed towards a just, legitimate \r\nsolution to the conflict in the Middle East, in the \r\nframework of the international legality established by \r\nthe various Security Council resolutions. \r\n Argentina continues to closely follow the \r\nevolving situation in Haiti. Demonstrations and the \r\nsocial tension created by the crisis in food prices last \r\nApril highlighted once again how stability is \r\ninterrelated with social development. The \r\nestablishment of the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has contributed from \r\nits inception to improving the security situation, \r\nfacilitating the democratic transition, promoting a \r\nframework of greater respect for human rights and \r\nstrengthening the institutional capacity of the Haitian \r\nState. \r\n The formation of a new Government last \r\nSeptember has now created an opportunity for renewed \r\ncooperation with the Security Council to continue \r\nconsolidating achievements and reaching the pending \r\nobjectives. Reform of the police force, the judiciary \r\nand the penal system, the development of an effective \r\nborder management framework, the promotion of a \r\npolitical dialogue and the coordination of international \r\ncooperation continue to be priority topics for \r\nMINUSTAH’s action. \r\n The Secretary-General has presented us with \r\nguidelines for a consolidation plan which will make it \r\npossible for us to assess the progress in Haiti in five \r\nessential areas that are mutually interlinked. Argentina \r\nwill closely follow the development of those variables \r\nand will seek to continue to contribute to the fulfilment \r\nof MINUSTAH’s mandate.  \r\n Security Council reform is a complement to the \r\nprocess of reforming the Organization and should \r\ncontinue to be a priority on our agenda. In its current \r\ncomposition, the Council does not reflect current \r\nrealities, either in terms of its representativity or in \r\nterms of its working methods. As pointed out last year, \r\nevery day that goes by without reform of the Council \r\nmakes that body more illegitimate and more ossified — \r\nillegitimate because of its inadequate representation of \r\nthe 192 United Nations Members and ossified because \r\nit reflects a 60-year-old historical reality.  \r\n Argentina, as a member of the group Uniting for \r\nConsensus, believes that we should, in a balanced \r\nmanner, mirror the Organization’s current composition \r\nin the Security Council. For example, reserving seats \r\nfor regional representation would guarantee the \r\ninterests of developing countries, small States, small \r\nisland States and all under-represented countries and \r\nregions. The Council’s membership should be \r\nexpanded taking into account the principles of \r\ndemocracy, equity and accountability. In our view, \r\nthose three principles can be guaranteed only by \r\nexpanding the category of elected members.  \r\n On 11 and 17 November, the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group met pursuant to decision 62/557, which \r\nmandates it to define a framework and modalities for \r\nthe preparation and facilitation of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations that will begin next \r\nFebruary in the informal plenary consultations format. \r\nIn this phase, our primary objective is to define, within \r\nthe Working Group, objectives, principles and terms \r\nthat will guide our future work and enable us to \r\nidentify basic principles for future intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We hope that, at the close of the phase of \r\nWorking Group consultations, we can present results \r\nthat are favourable to all parties.  \r\n In the view of our delegation, the process of \r\ncomprehensively reforming the Security Council in all \r\nits aspects can succeed only with clear rules and \r\nprocedures that will guarantee a fair result for all. \r\n Mr. Del Rosario Ceballos (Dominican Republic) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): On behalf of my delegation, I \r\nshould like to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for having convened this important plenary \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly. At the same time, I \r\nwish to express our appreciation for the way in which \r\nmy valued friend Ambassador Jorge Urbina, in his \r\ncapacity as President of the Security Council, \r\nintroduced the report now before us (A/2008/2). \r\n Today, the General Assembly has before it one of \r\nthe most important items inscribed on its agenda: the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. The interest of all United Nations Member \r\nStates in restructuring the Security Council as a matter \r\nof urgency has been amply demonstrated.  \r\n In the various statements on the issue, we note a \r\nclear tendency to highlight the overall importance of \r\nreforming the Security Council to strengthen its efforts \r\nto maintain international peace and security so that it \r\ncan address the challenges before it in the best way \r\npossible. In that spirit, we welcome and recognize as a \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n11 08-60935 \r\n \r\ngenuine step forward the adoption of decision 62/557 \r\non 15 September, which truly marked the beginning of \r\nthe eagerly awaited intergovernmental negotiations in \r\nplenary consultations of the General Assembly. \r\nRegardless of the interpretations and technicalities \r\ncited by some Member States with regard to that \r\nimportant decision in terms of the framework and the \r\nmodalities for those intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nwe have an agreement that, we believe, while very \r\ngeneral in nature, lays the foundations for the basic \r\nprinciples of reform and the changes needed after more \r\nthan 15 years of deliberations. \r\n In our long diplomatic career at the United \r\nNations, we have noted with satisfaction a number of \r\nchanges made to the Security Council’s working \r\nmethods. I am referring to the general increase in the \r\nnumber of public meetings, briefings and informative \r\nconsultations, the fact that the floor is given more \r\nfrequently to non-members of the Council during \r\nexploratory debates and the fact that non-members are \r\nallowed to participate more actively in more important \r\ndebates, sometimes in the deliberative phase and \r\nsometimes in the decision-making phase. That progress \r\nis undeniable.  \r\n However, those practices must become the rule \r\nrather than the exception — hence the need to make \r\nmore lasting improvements, which must be carried out \r\nwithin the framework of broad reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. We are speaking about the need to reform the \r\nCouncil’s composition and functioning in order to \r\nmake it a more representative organ and to further \r\nimprove its working methods and its decision-making \r\nprocess so as to ensure greater openness, transparency \r\nand democracy within the organ. We are also speaking \r\nabout the need to examine all aspects of reform — \r\nincluding the periodic review of a reformed Security \r\nCouncil — as an integrated whole.  \r\nUndoubtedly, that is an arduous task, given the \r\nimportance of the interests at stake — such as, for \r\nexample, the question of the veto. However, what is \r\nparamount is the desire of the international community, \r\nrepresented at the United Nations, to carry out \r\nsubstantive reform of the Security Council that will \r\ncorrect the existing imbalance in geographical \r\nrepresentation and strengthen the international \r\nequilibrium. That would truly reflect the universal \r\nnature of our Organization. \r\n We should take advantage of the new framework \r\nand the negotiation cycle ahead of us to hold debates \r\nand make contributions that can raise the political level \r\nof our deliberations, thereby translating the political \r\nwill that is so often expressed into a truly constructive \r\napproach to Security Council reform.  \r\n We are fully confident that, under the skilful \r\nguidance of Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, we shall continue \r\nto find ways to make progress in our efforts to reform \r\nthe Security Council. We are confident that he will \r\nmake our debates as fruitful and dynamic as possible \r\nand will guide our efforts to undertake \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in plenary consultations \r\nof the Assembly with the achievable goal of building a \r\nmore representative and effective Council. We assure \r\nthe President that he can count on my delegation’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation.  \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to participate again this year, in \r\nthe consideration of the agenda item on the report of \r\nthe Security Council. We thank Ambassador Jorge \r\nUrbina, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica and \r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of \r\nNovember, for having introduced the Council’s report \r\nfor this year (A/63/2), which is before is for our \r\nconsideration today. \r\n We associate ourselves with the statement made \r\nat the 53rd meeting by the Permanent Representative of \r\nMauritius, speaking on behalf of the African Group. \r\nMy country would like to add a few comments in a \r\nnational capacity. \r\n The Security Council is an organ with a special \r\npurpose, as it is charged with ensuring international \r\npeace and security on behalf of all Member States of \r\nthe United Nations. While the source of its actions is \r\nlegitimate, since it derives from the founding \r\ninstrument, the United Nations Charter, we need to \r\nmake sure that its decisions are also in conformity with \r\nthe Charter and that they are taken in the interest of the \r\ninternational community as a whole. That is one of the \r\nreasons why the submission of the Security Council \r\nreport to the General Assembly is of special \r\nsignificance. Indeed, it should provide an opportunity \r\nfor the plenary, deliberative body of our universal \r\nOrganization to be informed in detail about how the \r\nSecurity Council has discharged its responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security as \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 12 \r\n \r\nwell as about the reasons underpinning the action or \r\ninaction of the Security Council. \r\n However, as several delegations have stressed, \r\nthe current format of the Security Council report does \r\nnot always provide the necessary elements for \r\nassessment and to spark and sustain a fruitful \r\ndiscussion. We therefore need to work so that the \r\nanalysis in the Council’s report is for both organs, the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, an \r\nopportunity to strengthen their relationship in order to \r\nbetter promote the values, objectives and principles of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Our consideration of the Security Council’s \r\nreport offers us an opportunity to discuss equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Council, which, more than ever before, is a topical \r\nsubject of concern to Member States. The reason is that \r\nSecurity Council reform has become necessary due to \r\nthe three-fold requirement of modernity, justice and \r\nlegitimacy of the Council. \r\n The position of Africa is known. The Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Mauritius described it well in his \r\nstatement at the beginning of the debate. Senegal \r\ndefends that position, recalling that we cannot talk of \r\nequitable representation on the Council without \r\nremedying the injustice of Africa being the only \r\ncontinent that does not have a permanent seat on it. \r\n Decision 62/557, adopted on 15 September 2008, \r\noffers new prospects that could finally make it possible \r\nfor us to embark on genuine intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. However, we need to remember that, in \r\naddition to gaining a more modern Council, one \r\nadapted to the realities of the twenty-first century, we \r\nneed above all a more legitimate Council, one that is in \r\na position, thanks to enhanced credibility and authority, \r\nto deal with the enormous challenges we face in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n In the context of this report, we need to make \r\nsure that the negotiating process is open, transparent \r\nand inclusive and that it take place completely within \r\nthe framework of and according to the procedures set \r\nout in decision 62/557. Any artificial solution obtained \r\nby forcing the issue or any other kind of pressure will \r\nonly further divide the international community on this \r\nquestion and diminish our chances of success. \r\n Senegal believes that the formula that will finally \r\nbe agreed must increase the representation of \r\ndeveloping countries and small States. \r\n Any reform of the Council, however, must \r\nstrengthen its effectiveness. To that end, the Council’s \r\nworking methods need to be adapted by increasing the \r\nparticipation of States not members of the Council. \r\n We know that we can rely on the wisdom of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the members of \r\nhis team to see to it that the momentum of Security \r\nCouncil reform during the Assembly’s sixty-first and \r\nsixty-second sessions is kept up and strengthened at the \r\ncurrent session. The President’s diligence and patience \r\nwill be, when we meet again, the instruments for \r\nfinalizing this reform that we sincerely want and that \r\nwill give the United Nations the means to better \r\nrespond to the aspirations of the peoples of the world. \r\n Mr. Borg (Malta): This year’s report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/63/2) once again demonstrates the \r\narray of challenges which the members of the Council \r\nwere confronted with during the 12 months of the \r\nreporting period. The 58 resolutions adopted by the \r\nCouncil as well as the 50 presidential statements \r\nclearly indicate the intensive work carried out by the \r\nCouncil, acting on behalf of the United Nations \r\nMember States and the international community at \r\nlarge, in the collective maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n As stated in the introduction to the report, “Africa \r\nagain featured prominently on the Council’s agenda” \r\nduring the 12 months. Indeed, 16 African countries \r\nwere the subject of careful examination by the Council. \r\nThis situation continues to highlight the critical \r\nimportance of the Council, working closely with the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in timely and appropriate action to \r\nprevent, under the relevant provision of the Charter, \r\naggravation of particular situations or disputes. \r\n In that regard, we welcome the mission to five \r\nAfrican countries organized last June by the Security \r\nCouncil, which brought the work of the Council closer \r\nto the Governments and peoples of conflict areas. It \r\nalso goes without saying that, in the context of \r\npeacekeeping operations, Africa continues to provide \r\nconsiderable human and financial challenges that \r\nrequire us to redouble our efforts to assist those \r\ncountries to overcome the obstacles they are \r\nencountering so that their people can live in peace and \r\nsecurity. We commend the interface that has been \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n13 08-60935 \r\n \r\nestablished between the Council and the African \r\nUnion. \r\n The situation in the Middle East continues to be \r\non the agenda of the Security Council after six \r\ndecades, and yet we are still searching for a lasting \r\nsolution to the Middle East problem with the \r\nPalestinian question at its core. While we do not \r\nunderestimate the complex nature of this question, we \r\nregret that the Council has not been able to agree on \r\ntimely and urgent measures to address the situations \r\nthat continue to block progress towards a \r\ncomprehensive and durable solution to this issue. The \r\ninternational community welcomed the Annapolis \r\nconference. The Security Council has a fundamental \r\nrole to play in solidly backing the outcome of that \r\nconference in order to advance the Middle East peace \r\nprocess. It is our hope that in the coming months the \r\nCouncil will review its efforts in support of the current \r\npositive engagement between Israelis and Palestinians. \r\n The role of United Nations peacekeepers in the \r\nnumerous ongoing operations should not be \r\nunderestimated and therefore needs the full support and \r\nencouragement of all Member States. The \r\nachievements of the United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, including in Nepal and in Liberia, are \r\nexamples showing that, with determination and the \r\nclose cooperation of all concerned, success is possible, \r\nand they give encouragement to others to surmount the \r\ndifficulties of achieving peace and reconciliation. \r\n Post-conflict peacebuilding is an important \r\nelement linking the work of the Security Council and \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has played a valuable role in giving a \r\nnumber of States emerging from conflict the \r\nopportunity and the necessary facilities to consolidate \r\nprogress towards durable peace and security in their \r\nwar-ravaged countries. We commend the members of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission for their dedication and \r\nactive contribution in this regard.  \r\n In all these areas, the role of regional and \r\nsubregional organizations in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security must continue to be \r\nstrengthened. Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United \r\nNations sets out the purpose and objectives for the \r\nSecurity Council in “the development of pacific \r\nsettlement of local disputes through such regional \r\narrangements or by such regional agencies either on the \r\ninitiative of the states concerned or by reference from \r\nthe Security Council” (Article 52, para. 3). The roles \r\nbeing played by the African Union, the European \r\nUnion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe, the Organization of American States and the \r\nLeague of Arab States are to be lauded and encouraged. \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n My delegation welcomes the initiative of holding \r\nthematic debates, which have taken place in the \r\nSecurity Council with the participation of a \r\nconsiderable number of Member States. We commend \r\nthe Council for its unfailing efforts to encourage global \r\njustice and fight impunity for crimes related to the \r\nviolation of human rights. It is increasingly \r\nacknowledged that the vulnerable groups of our \r\nsocieties, particularly women and children, must find \r\nthe necessary refuge and protection offered by the \r\nSecurity Council in times of armed conflict. The \r\npresidential statements on the protection of civilians \r\ncomplement and reinforce the valuable work being \r\ncarried out by the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.  \r\n Likewise, the work of the five subsidiary bodies \r\nof the Security Council is commendable and must be \r\nrecognized as an important building block in the \r\nCouncil’s overall work. \r\n I would like now to turn my attention briefly to \r\nSecurity Council reform by highlighting a few points \r\nthat I raised during the last meeting of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group concerning the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the \r\nCouncil. Last Monday, the Open-ended Working Group \r\ncontinued its consideration of the follow-up to decision \r\n62/557 of the General Assembly’s sixty-second \r\nsession. My delegation welcomed that decision, which \r\nbuilds on the progress achieved so far, in particular \r\nduring the 2006 and 2007 Assembly sessions, as well \r\nas the positions of and proposals made by Member \r\nStates to continue immediately to address within the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group the framework and \r\nmodalities in order to prepare and facilitate \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n We acknowledge the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup’s role in Security Council reform even though \r\nthat Group has recently been unfairly accused of not \r\ndelivering the goods. We firmly believe that the time is \r\nripe to commence intergovernmental negotiations, no \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 14 \r\n \r\nlater than 28 February 2009. We still believe that, in \r\norder for the intergovernmental negotiations to \r\nsucceed, we need a programme of work that defines a \r\nstructured plan for meetings in the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group that should serve as a basis for the \r\npreparation of the launching of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. As we stated in the Working Group on \r\nMonday, we have never been so close to starting \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n As a representative of a small island State, I \r\nwould be remiss if I did not seize this opportunity to \r\nexhort small and medium-sized countries to be \r\ninvolved in the negotiating process as soon as it is \r\nlaunched. We believe that Security Council reform \r\nmust perforce accommodate the interests and concerns \r\nof all Member States, be they large, medium or small. \r\nAll Member States, large and small, must claim \r\nownership of the reform by ensuring that their interests \r\nare fully taken into account. Any formula for Security \r\nCouncil reform that addresses the interests of only a \r\nfew, in total disregard for the wishes of small and \r\nmedium-sized countries, can hardly be expected to \r\nproduce legitimate reform. A comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council must lead to a more democratic, \r\ninclusive, equitably representative, transparent, \r\neffective and accountable Council. Any process \r\nundertaken in this regard must be all-inclusive. \r\n Our primordial consideration continues to be the \r\ndemocratization of the work of our Organization, the \r\nUnited Nations, and one of its principal organs, where \r\nevery country counts. The central element guiding the \r\nreform of the Security Council should be the \r\nstrengthening of its authority through its nature and \r\nlegitimacy, whereby all Member States have the equal \r\nopportunity to represent their country on the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines): Saint Vincent and the Grenadines aligns \r\nitself with the statements made at the 53rd meeting by \r\nBarbados on behalf of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) and by Cuba on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n According to our Charter, the Security Council \r\nhas the “primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security”. It is through the \r\nprism of that formidable responsibility that Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines views this report and the \r\nquestion of Security Council reform. \r\n In our own region, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines would like to thank the Council for \r\ncontinuing to focus its attention on the threats to peace \r\nand security that confront our brothers and sisters in \r\nHaiti. We welcome the continued presence of the \r\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and call \r\nfor its further extension and expansion in a manner that \r\nreflects the current situation on the ground and is \r\ncognizant of the ongoing threats facing our fellow \r\nCaribbean Community State. \r\n There are also many hotspots and flashpoints for \r\nconflict across our troubled planet, and Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines thanks the Council for the work \r\nthat it has done, and continues to do, in pursuing its \r\nfunctions and responsibilities. We are grateful for every \r\nconflict contained, resolved or avoided through the \r\nwork of the Council. We also acknowledge the \r\nmagnificent bravery and sacrifice of troops, police and \r\nother personnel, and we thank those States who have \r\nvolunteered their sons and daughters to the noble cause \r\nof world peace. \r\n However, it is the nature of the Council’s work \r\nand mandate that its shortcomings and failures will \r\nattract more attention than its successes. That is as it \r\nshould be, because every failure of the Council \r\nrepresents lives lost, peoples uprooted and \r\ndevelopment being reversed.  \r\n In that regard, my delegation confesses some \r\ndisappointment with the content of the report (A/63/2) \r\nbefore us. I am reminded of the job applicant, who, \r\nlacking the necessary accomplishments to really \r\ndistinguish himself, resorts to puffery and padding of \r\nhis résumé to dazzle with verbosity and mind-numbing \r\nassemblages of data that are devoid of context. \r\n Take, for example, the Council’s assessment of its \r\nwork in the Sudan, where, as we speak, another slow-\r\nmoving genocide is staining humanity’s conscience. On \r\npages 14 to 17 of the report, my delegation learned that \r\nthe Security Council condemned, condemned in the \r\nstrongest possible terms, expressed strong concern, \r\nexpressed deep concern, expressed serious concern, \r\nconsidered reports, heard briefings, adopted \r\nstatements, took note of developments, exchanged \r\nviews, and extended the mandate of existing ineffective \r\nmissions and panels of experts, essentially perpetuating \r\nan unacceptable status quo. But what did the Council \r\nactually do to stop people from being massacred? Is \r\nthat what we meant by “never again”? An endless \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n15 08-60935 \r\n \r\nstream of impotent statements and interminable hand \r\nwringing is of no comfort to the murdered innocents in \r\nDarfur and represents a stark failing by the Council to \r\nfulfil its mandate. \r\n Similarly, regarding the situation in the Middle \r\nEast, including the Palestinian question, we learn from \r\nthe report that: “the Council was not able to reach the \r\nunanimity needed for it to take any action during the \r\ncurrent 12-month reporting period, despite the seven \r\nattempts that were presented by different delegations in \r\ndue course” (A/63/2, p. 1). The Council was also limited \r\nto merely reviewing the situations in Kenya and \r\nZimbabwe, apparently since “neither situation is a \r\nformal Security Council agenda item” (A/63/2, p. 1).  \r\n Those failings, and many others, speak to both \r\nthe absence of the requisite political will and the \r\nstructural inadequacies of the Security Council. \r\nPolitical priorities that justify billions to save \r\nprofligate financiers but pinch pennies in lifesaving \r\nefforts, or that sacrifice our young in far more ignoble \r\nadventures than the cause of international peace cannot \r\nbe blamed solely on the Council. However, we can and \r\nmust address the issue of the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, because its current track record does not \r\ninspire confidence in its ability to operate effectively \r\nas it is. \r\n When the Security Council was created in 1948, \r\nthe United Nations consisted of 58 Members. Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, like 133 other current \r\nMember States, was neither consulted nor afforded an \r\nopportunity to address the composition and function of \r\nthe Council. When we joined the United Nations, like \r\n133 other countries, the composition of the Council \r\nwas presented to us as a fait accompli — an immutable \r\nand immovable object in the United Nations landscape. \r\n As the world has moved from great-Power \r\nunilateralism to multipolar, multilateral \r\ninterconnectedness, and as new Powers and threats \r\nhave emerged and old ones have faded, the Council \r\nremains stubbornly resistant to change and impervious \r\nto the logic of an evolving world. As the United \r\nNations trumpets equality, the Council remains \r\nfundamentally unequal. As we cheer emerging \r\ndemocracies, the Council is firmly undemocratic and \r\nunrepresentative. As we demand transparency, the \r\nCouncil’s functions remain shrouded and opaque. And \r\nas we decolonize the world, our most cherished \r\ninternational function remains the sole province of a \r\nvirtual five-headed monarchy, largely unchanged in 60 \r\nyears of global metamorphosis. \r\n How, for example, can this report state that \r\n“Africa again featured prominently on the Council’s \r\nagenda” (A/63/2, p. 1), while the Council itself remains \r\ndevoid of a permanent African presence? Surely, Africa \r\ndeserves appropriate membership on a body that is \r\noften preoccupied with the continent, quite apart from \r\nthe undeniable overarching logic of equitable and \r\ndevelopmental representation. \r\n To be fair, the stagnation of reform is not entirely \r\nthe fault of the Council itself, but of us, the members \r\nof the General Assembly. We have for too long \r\nsuccumbed to paralysis by the analyses or the undue \r\npressures exerted by minority groups with a narrow \r\nself-interest in inaction. \r\n We therefore welcome decision 62/557, which the \r\nPresident of the Assembly described on Monday as our \r\nroad map and yesterday as our platform for progress. \r\nDecision 62/557 has finally cleared the way for \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to begin no later than \r\nFebruary of next year, but hopefully much sooner. \r\nThere will undoubtedly be hiccups on the road to \r\nsubstantive Security Council reform. However, we urge \r\nall Member States to approach the process in good \r\nfaith and with flexibility. \r\n Yesterday, the President again reminded us of the \r\nnoble imperative of: “a more democratic United \r\nNations, where every country counts” (A/63/PV.53). \r\nThat imperative is rooted in the principle of the \r\nsovereign equality of States, which underpins the \r\noperation of this body. That equality might be a legal \r\nfiction, but the legality of that fiction is enshrined in \r\nour Charter and there is no place for Orwellian notions \r\nthat some States are more equal than others. It follows \r\nnaturally from that concept that negotiations are open \r\nto all States and that the voices of all States are to be \r\nequally respected in that process. \r\n As such, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nrejects, as a matter of principle, any undue pressure \r\nbeing applied by minority groups or any backroom \r\ngentlemen’s agreements that supersede the letter and \r\nspirit of unanimous decisions. Similarly, we repudiate \r\nthe concept that we must somehow avoid voting on the \r\nsubstance of Security Council reform, lest influential \r\nmembers of a small minority question the credibility of \r\na reformed Council. In response we ask: What of the \r\n134 Members who have never had the opportunity to \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 16 \r\n \r\nvoice an opinion on the current Council? Are we not \r\ncollectively and individually influential? And why \r\nshould we accept the credibility of a process that \r\ndenies us our right to stand up and be counted?  \r\n To fear the transformative democratic power of \r\nthe vote or to weigh and rank States’ positions by their \r\nmilitary and financial might is to debase the \r\nfoundations upon which this institution stands. We \r\nhave as our road map a decision that explicitly divorces \r\nthe consultative role of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on Security Council Reform from the \r\nsubstantive negotiations to come in the General \r\nAssembly plenary. It serves no one to revisit, \r\nrenegotiate or subvert a unanimous decision of such \r\nrecent vintage. The clarity of decision 62/557 leaves no \r\ndoubt as to the urgency of our task. \r\n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has no \r\naspirations to join the permanent membership of a \r\nreformed Council and is under no illusions as to the \r\ndifficulties inherent in the reform process or the myriad \r\nmodern challenges facing a reformed Council. Instead, \r\nwe approach this issue from a position of principle and \r\npragmatism, and we see the efficacious functioning of \r\na democratic, representative, nimble, responsive and \r\ntransparent Council as absolutely essential to the core \r\nvalues of the United Nations. Let us rise above \r\npettiness and dilatory tactics and get on with the \r\nserious work of reform. \r\n Ms. Štiglic (Slovenia): At the outset, let me thank \r\nthe President of the Assembly for convening this \r\nmeeting. I would also like to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Costa Rica, His Excellency Mr. Jorge \r\nUrbina, for presenting to the General Assembly the \r\nreport of the Security Council covering the period \r\n1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008 (A/63/2), which \r\ncontains revealing facts regarding the diverse agenda, \r\nthe ever increasing workload and the complexity of the \r\nissues before the Council. \r\n There is still much room for improvement in the \r\nCouncil’s transparency, inclusiveness and \r\naccountability, so that it can fulfil its responsibility to \r\nmaintain international peace and security in the most \r\neffective and efficient way. Slovenia believes that \r\nurgent consideration has to be given to the \r\ntransformation of existing structures. Reform of the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council is long overdue, and it \r\nis an essential part of overall United Nations reform. \r\nWith regard to the Council, reform needs to address \r\nboth the enlargement of membership and the \r\nimprovement of its working methods. \r\n We welcome the open debate that took place \r\nunder the Belgian presidency of the Security Council \r\nin August on the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil. Regardless of the Security Council’s size, we \r\nneed to promote improvements in its working methods \r\nand the Council’s interaction with the entire \r\nmembership of the Organization. We also appreciate \r\nand support the initiatives of the “Small Five” (S-5) in \r\nthis regard. \r\n While progress has been made in the area of \r\nworking methods, the second part of the reform \r\nagenda, namely, enlargement of Security Council \r\nmembership, has been lagging behind. Although the \r\ndiscussions on Security Council reform in recent years \r\nhave produced useful ideas, and valuable work has \r\nbeen done by the facilitators appointed by previous \r\nGeneral Assembly Presidents, the time has come for \r\nspecific proposals and, ultimately, decisions. \r\nEnlargement of the Security Council is not only a \r\nmatter of fairness, but it is also the necessary condition \r\nfor the Council’s effectiveness. The time is ripe for \r\nchanges in the Council’s structure that will make it \r\nmore representative and strengthen its authority and \r\nlegitimacy.  \r\n We have to maintain the momentum generated in \r\nprevious discussions and move forward. We, therefore, \r\nwelcome General Assembly decision 62/557 of \r\n15 September 2008, adopted unanimously, to continue \r\nimmediately with discussions within the framework of \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group and to commence \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in informal plenary of \r\nthe General Assembly not later than 28 February 2009. \r\nThese negotiations, in order to be successful, have to \r\nbe conducted in an open, transparent and inclusive \r\nmanner. We also welcome the appointment of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Zahir Tanin, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, to facilitate the process. \r\nWe are convinced that under his able leadership we can \r\nachieve some tangible results at the end of this process. \r\n Allow me, Sir, to take this opportunity to draw \r\nthe General Assembly’s attention to some ideas put \r\nforward by the President of Slovenia, His Excellency \r\nMr. Danilo Türk, in his address to the General \r\nAssembly during this year’s general debate. Those \r\nideas could be helpful to the General Assembly \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n17 08-60935 \r\n \r\npresidency during the coming discussion on the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n The membership of the Security Council could be \r\nexpanded in three directions. First, there should be six \r\nadditional permanent members from all the regions of \r\nthe world. Secondly, there should be an additional \r\ncategory of non-permanent members with a more \r\nfrequent rotation, six in any particular composition of \r\nthe Security Council, elected in accordance with a \r\nformula to be determined by the General Assembly and \r\nalternating every second two-year term. Thirdly, the \r\nremaining eight non-permanent members would be \r\nelected in accordance with the principle of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution. Thus, the total size of the \r\nreformed Security Council would not exceed 25 \r\nmembers. The amendment to the Charter authorizing \r\nthe enlargement of the Security Council would also \r\nneed to include a review clause allowing for a \r\ncomprehensive review of the new system. \r\n We must not fail to use the momentum created by \r\nthe unanimous decision by Member States to move \r\nforward the negotiations on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n We are convinced that the leadership, guidance \r\nand wisdom of the General Assembly President, \r\ncoupled with the necessary political will, good faith \r\nand flexibility among the membership, will bring us to \r\na successful conclusion of these prolonged debates on \r\nthe issue of Security Council reform. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): At the outset, I wish to thank \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, in his \r\ncapacity as President of the Security Council for the \r\nmonth of November 2008, for introducing the report of \r\nthe Security Council, contained in document A/63/2. \r\n My delegation regards this debate as an important \r\nopportunity for Member States to appraise the \r\nperformance and effectiveness of the Security Council \r\nin discharging its responsibilities. Article 24 of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter states that the Security Council \r\nis entrusted with primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nthat in carrying out this responsibility the Security \r\nCouncil acts on Member States’ behalf. Since this is \r\nthe mandate, Member States should ideally be the ones \r\nto periodically assess the work and performance of the \r\nSecurity Council. This report of the Security Council to \r\nthe General Assembly is one way to discharge that \r\nresponsibility. We thank the Permanent Representative \r\nof Viet Nam for organizing a meeting in July during his \r\npresidency of the Council to hear views from Member \r\nStates as the report was being prepared. \r\n Another avenue by means of which Member \r\nStates can be kept apprised of Security Council \r\ndeliberations is through periodic briefings by the \r\nPresident of the Council. We thank those who briefed \r\nus during their presidencies. We note, however, that \r\nthese briefings have been sporadic. Malaysia reiterates \r\nits call for there to be more regular, open briefings on \r\nthe work of the Security Council, so that non-members \r\nof the Council can be kept abreast of its work. \r\n We note that the overall international peace and \r\nsecurity situation remains very challenging, including \r\nduring the period covered by the report. The Security \r\nCouncil has maintained the same rigorous pace as last \r\nyear in holding 219 formal meetings, as compared to \r\n224 meetings in 2007, including 191 public meetings. \r\nThe Council also adopted 58 resolutions and 50 \r\npresidential statements. We note, too, that the Council \r\nheld 177 closed consultations of the whole and an \r\nundisclosed number of informal consultations. We see \r\nthe sense and need for non-members of the Security \r\nCouncil, particularly those directly involved in the \r\nissues being considered, to participate and provide \r\ninput at those meetings and consultations. My \r\ndelegation reiterates the oft-repeated calls by Member \r\nStates for greater transparency, accountability and \r\nimproved participation of the general membership of \r\nthe United Nations in the work of the Security Council. \r\n We note the continued focus by the Security \r\nCouncil on the challenging situations besetting several \r\nregions in Africa, which also reflect the complex socio-\r\neconomic and political developments of the continent \r\nas a whole. One third of the 42 main items relating to \r\nthe maintenance of peace and security deal with \r\nconflicts in Africa. Several debates relating directly to \r\nAfrica were held, including those on peace and security \r\nin Africa and the role of the Security Council in \r\nconflict prevention and resolution, particularly in \r\nAfrica. In addition, several thematic issues also have \r\nreference to Africa, including the issues of the role of \r\nregional and subregional organizations in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security, post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding, children and armed conflict, small arms, \r\nand women and peace and security. We note also that a \r\nSecurity Council mission was organized to visit five \r\nAfrican countries. There have been some encouraging \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 18 \r\n \r\nresults in mitigating a number of conflicts in Africa, \r\nwith some movement towards a peacebuilding mode. \r\nBut there still remain many daunting challenges that \r\npose serious threats to regional and international peace \r\nand security, notably with regard to the situation in the \r\nHorn of Africa, the Great Lakes region and \r\nSudan/Chad. \r\n Malaysia had been among several countries from \r\noutside the region that were affected by the situation in \r\nthe Horn of Africa, in particular piracy in the Gulf of \r\nAden, which has become more pronounced recently. \r\nWe therefore urge the Security Council to continue to \r\nincrease its efforts at restoring and ensuring peace and \r\nstability in the region. Efforts at continuing to engage \r\nand work closely with regional organizations, \r\nincluding the African Union, are among several options \r\nthat the Security Council could pursue. \r\n While we agree that the Security Council should \r\ngive greater attention to developments in Africa, we \r\nregret that little, if any, is given to addressing the \r\nPalestinian question. This continues to be the main \r\ncause of instability and insecurity not only in the \r\nMiddle East region but in the world at large. Despite \r\nthe monthly public briefings and debates conducted by \r\nthe Security Council, the Council has of late failed to \r\nadopt a single outcome on the question. What is most \r\nfrustrating is that even the most obvious violations, \r\nsuch as the continuing construction of illegal \r\nsettlements, which has been acknowledged at many \r\nmeetings, including at Annapolis, have failed to get \r\nany response or reaction from the Security Council. \r\n We do not understand why the Council should be \r\nso concerned and eager to act on matters such as \r\nclimate change, where security implications are \r\ndebatable, yet be stone silent on the Palestinian \r\nquestion. We are deeply disappointed, and we regret \r\nthat the Council has been rendered ineffective in \r\nfinding a workable solution to the Palestinian question, \r\nan issue that has been with the Security Council since \r\nits inception.  \r\n We also regret that the Security Council has \r\nfailed to implement its own resolutions on this subject \r\nincluding its resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \r\nThe continued failure of the Security Council to solve \r\nthe Palestinian question has undermined its credibility \r\nin the maintenance of the international peace and \r\nsecurity, which I should recall, is a responsibility \r\nconferred on it by Article 24 of the Charter. \r\n Malaysia takes note of the Security Council’s \r\nown effort to improve its working methods. During the \r\nperiod covered in the report, the Council adopted \r\npresidential note S/2007/749, which outlined new \r\nmeasures regarding participation in informal \r\nconsultations of the general membership of the United \r\nNations and of experts, the issuance of the summary \r\nstatement of issues of which the Council is seized and \r\nthe preparation of the annual report to the General \r\nAssembly. We applaud the thickness of this year’s \r\nSecurity Council report in terms of volume but note \r\nthat, even with the extra detail, the report is limited to \r\nthe mere factual presentation of the activities of the \r\nCouncil and its subsidiary bodies. \r\n My delegation is of the view that the report of the \r\nSecurity Council should be more substantive and \r\nanalytical, so as to enable Member States to make a \r\nproper assessment and gain an understanding of the \r\neffectiveness of the Council in discharging its \r\nresponsibilities. The report should provide the \r\njustification and rationale behind major actions and \r\ndecisions of the Council. Likewise, the report should \r\nalso be transparent concerning the failure of the \r\nCouncil to adopt a particular draft resolution or action. \r\n In August 2008 the Security Council held an open \r\ndebate on the subject of improving its own working \r\nmethods (see S/PV.5968). Malaysia believes that a \r\nnumber of useful proposals were made during the open \r\ndebate which are worth revisiting. We hope that those \r\nproposals will not merely be relegated to the annals of \r\nhistory. \r\n It seems to my delegation that the workload of \r\nthe Council has increased in recent years. This seems \r\nto be a ongoing trend and is likely to continue in view \r\nof the outstanding issues and breaking conflicts that \r\nnecessitate the Council’s attention. The Council is thus \r\nfast reaching its capacity. In order to avoid the Council \r\nbecoming overstretched in areas which are not within \r\nits specific mandate to oversee, the Council should \r\nrefocus on its core business: the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security under Chapters VI and \r\nVII of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n The item on the “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the \r\nSecurity Council” has been on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly since September 1992, though \r\nattempts were made as early as 1979 to include it in the \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n19 08-60935 \r\n \r\nagenda. We understand that the background to this was \r\nthe increase in United Nations membership from 113 in \r\n1963 to 152 countries in 1979, and the amendment of \r\nthe Charter in 1965. The amendment resulted in an \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nfrom 11 to 15. The membership of our Organization \r\nhas since increased to 192 countries, which makes it \r\neven more relevant to address this question. Fifteen \r\nStates, with five having permanent membership and the \r\nright to veto, seems an incongruous arrangement for a \r\nbody entrusted with international peace and security. \r\n The inclusion of this agenda item in the work of \r\nthe General Assembly and the establishment of the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council \r\nreform have enabled us to have discussion. Yet very \r\nlittle progress has been achieved on this question. \r\nWhile we believed that there was much value in taking \r\ncarefully considered steps rather than a giant leap into \r\nthe unknown, the movement was too snail-paced for \r\nthe comfort of all. \r\n However, the adoption of decision 62/557 on \r\n15 September 2008 gives us cause to be optimistic that \r\nthe day has finally arrived when we can all begin to \r\nengage in intergovernmental negotiations. We believe \r\nthat we actually have a chance to make concrete \r\nprogress. Decision 62/557 provides a definitive \r\ntimeline, by which we should begin intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations no later than 28 February 2009. \r\n We saw the divisiveness that was apparent in the \r\nfirst meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, which \r\nconcluded last Monday. There seemed to be a \r\nreinterpretation of decision 62/557, which we had \r\nadopted by consensus. We are quite concerned at this \r\ndevelopment and hope that it is not a reflection of what \r\nwe should expect to encounter when we begin \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We reiterate that, amid \r\nthe interpretation of 62/557, including on whether the \r\ncommencement of intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwould be determined by the outcome of the Open-\r\nended Working Group’s addressing of framework and \r\nmodalities, the intergovernmental negotiations will \r\nproceed as agreed by 28 February 2009. \r\n We trust in the leadership and wisdom of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to ensure that the \r\nprocess leading towards reform of the Security Council \r\nwill yield concrete results in negotiations that are open, \r\ntransparent and inclusive. We reaffirm our support and \r\ncooperation in working with the President and other \r\nmembers of this body to successfully complete our task \r\nof reforming the Security Council so that it is more \r\ndemocratic, representative, effective and transparent. \r\n Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation appreciates this opportunity to take part \r\nin this joint debate on the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly and on the question \r\nof the necessary reform of the Security Council. \r\n At the outset, with regard to the Security \r\nCouncil’s report to the General Assembly (A/63/2), I \r\nwould like in particular to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Costa Rica, as President of the \r\nCouncil for this month, for his presentation of the \r\nreport. Costa Rica is making a very laudable effort in \r\nfulfilling this important responsibility, through which it \r\nis promoting transparency and the broadest possible \r\nparticipation in the work of that principal organ of the \r\nOrganization, which, according to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, bears primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n The report submitted by the Security Council on \r\nthis occasion is more analytical than last year’s, as \r\nrequested by a large number of delegations during the \r\ndiscussion held at the sixty-second session of the \r\nAssembly. We are thus moving forward, in that \r\nMembers of the Organization can adequately evaluate \r\nof the work carried out by the Council during the \r\nspecified period. As can be seen in the report, the \r\nSecurity Council has considered a set of cross-cutting \r\nissues which are of particular relevance to the General \r\nAssembly. I am referring to issues such as \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament, the fight against \r\nterrorism, the protection of civilians in armed conflict \r\nand the protection of women in armed conflict, to cite \r\nonly a few examples.  \r\n Those are issues that the Security Council has \r\nconsidered in depth and areas in which the two \r\nprincipal United Nations organs should have greater \r\ninteraction, exploring the various avenues opened up to \r\nus by the United Nations Charter itself. Specifically, I \r\nam referring to the implementation of Article 15, which \r\nestablishes that the General Assembly shall receive and \r\nconsider annual and special reports from the Council \r\nconcerning the measures that the Council has decided \r\nupon or taken to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n My delegation understands that, if we encourage \r\nthe drafting and submission of such reports on \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 20 \r\n \r\nparticular issues — a possibility that is also addressed \r\nin Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter — we can \r\nimprove the interaction and cooperation between the \r\ntwo principal United Nations organs. We believe that \r\nthat would result in the adoption of more effective \r\nmeasures aimed at preventing and eliminating threats \r\nto peace and promoting conditions conducive to \r\ninternational security. \r\n Better interaction between the two principal \r\nUnited Nations organs is an issue of great importance \r\nto the Organization’s future and should be addressed in \r\nthe forthcoming intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. As members are aware, the \r\ncommencement of those negotiations was agreed upon \r\nat the close of the previous Assembly session, when we \r\nadopted decision 62/557 in order to achieve a more \r\ndemocratic, representative, responsible, legitimate, \r\neffective, participatory and transparent Council. In that \r\ndecision, we also agreed to continue to hold \r\nconsultations within the Open-ended Working Group \r\non the framework and the modalities for future \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Therefore, we are \r\nconvinced that we must take the maximum advantage \r\nof the time available to us — until 1 February 2009 at \r\nthe latest — to prepare for and facilitate the holding of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations so that, as we all \r\nhope, they can lead to as broad a general agreement as \r\npossible among Member States on the various aspects \r\nof Security Council reform. That will make it possible \r\nfor such reform to be truly owned and accepted by the \r\nentire membership, to enter into force as soon as \r\npossible and to be implemented and effective. \r\n As for the various issues that will arise in the \r\nforthcoming negotiations, our position is well known \r\nconcerning the size and composition of the Security \r\nCouncil. We are convinced that a more democratic, \r\nrepresentative, responsible and thus more legitimate \r\nCouncil can result from an expansion of the category \r\nof non-permanent members, which are the only \r\nmembers elected periodically by the Assembly and thus \r\naccountable to it. Our position, which does not favour \r\nan expansion of the permanent-member category, \r\nshould be interpreted not as a rejection of a particular \r\ncountry or group of countries, but rather as a matter of \r\nprinciple based on the general interest of the \r\nOrganization, which is far greater than the individual \r\ninterest of any Member State.  \r\n With regard to the Council’s decision-making \r\nmechanisms, it should be recalled that any expansion \r\nof the Council’s composition will necessarily require \r\nthat the majority needed to take decisions be adjusted. \r\nFrom that perspective, our position is that a distinction \r\nshould be made between the various types of Council \r\ndecisions — just as the Charter distinguishes between \r\nprocedural and substantive issues — and that we \r\nshould also take into account the diverse scope of \r\nsubstantive Council decisions affecting Chapter VII or \r\nother types of issues under the Charter. \r\n We believe that the use of the veto should be \r\nreserved exclusively for decisions that the Council \r\nadopts to implement Chapter VII of the Charter, \r\nbecause such issues require agreement among the \r\npermanent members. We are in favour of the various \r\nproposals aimed at limiting the use of the veto in cases \r\nin which it is not really necessary or required under the \r\nCharter.  \r\n Concerning the issue of regional representation, \r\nwe are convinced of the need to give regional groups a \r\ngreater role in designating and endorsing their Council \r\ncandidatures, ensuring appropriate subregional \r\nrepresentation in each of them. We also favour the \r\nestablishment of mechanisms that would guarantee the \r\nrepresentation of transregional groups, such as the \r\nLeague of Arab States and the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, including through arrangements \r\namong the regional organizations concerned.  \r\n In any case, we need to find formulas that ensure \r\nadequate representation for small and medium-size \r\nStates and for countries of the developing world, \r\nparticularly in Africa. However, a more prominent role \r\nfor regional groups must not call into question the \r\ncompetencies of the General Assembly, which, under \r\nthe Charter, has the last word in electing \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council. That \r\ngives them the legitimacy of having the support of the \r\nOrganization’s entire membership. \r\n With regard to the Council’s working methods, \r\nmy delegation supports the proposals submitted by the \r\nGroup of Five Small Countries. In particular, we \r\nsupport the proposed reforms related to monitoring the \r\nimplementation of Council decisions — through the \r\nestablishment of appropriate assessment mechanisms — \r\nand to the functioning of the Council’s subsidiary \r\nbodies.  \r\n I should like to take this opportunity to \r\nemphasize that, in addition to strictly monitoring the \r\nCouncil’s functioning, we must promote greater \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n21 08-60935 \r\n \r\ndialogue and interaction between Council members and \r\nrepresentatives of civil society, including \r\nnon-governmental organizations and personalities from \r\nthe parliamentary, academic or business worlds. If we \r\ntruly want credible reform of the Security Council that \r\nmakes it more democratic, representative, responsible, \r\nlegitimate, effective and transparent, we must be able \r\nto adequately address the main reform issues, without \r\nany exception, during the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that will begin on 28 February 2009 at the \r\nlatest. We are fully prepared for those negotiations and \r\nhope that all other Members of the Organization will \r\nbe at that time.  \r\n Mr. Hill (Australia): Given the time pressure, I \r\nwill deal just with the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters. Australia \r\nrecognizes that intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council are long overdue. \r\nWe support their imminent start and the initiative that \r\nthe Assembly President has shown in commencing that \r\nprocess. \r\n Reform of the Security Council is one of the most \r\nimportant institutional issues currently before Member \r\nStates and is something in which all Member States \r\nhave a stake. Australia will participate in \r\nintergovernmental negotiations with the goal of \r\nbringing about a more representative Security Council \r\nthat acts with greater authority, unity and credibility \r\nand functions more efficiently and democratically. \r\n We will approach the negotiations with open \r\nminds, recognizing that reform will be achievable only \r\nif we, as Member States, can develop a solution that \r\ngains as broad support as possible. Australia looks \r\nforward to working with delegations from across the \r\ndiversity of positions to find a solution that achieves \r\nthat support, while keeping an eye at all times on \r\nensuring that the Security Council remains relevant to \r\nthe modern world. Throughout the negotiations, we \r\nmust focus on ensuring that the decision-making \r\ncapacity of the Security Council is not diminished, but \r\nrather enhanced. That can be achieved only if \r\neffectiveness and equitable representation are balanced. \r\n We must keep in sight that, through the United \r\nNations Charter, we Member States have conferred \r\nupon the Security Council primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. At \r\na time when the agenda of the Council is full and the \r\nchallenges facing countries are many, we must take a \r\nglobal view and not confuse the Council’s \r\nresponsibility with our own national or regional \r\npreferences. \r\n Australia considers that, for the Security Council \r\nto remain relevant, any reform must acknowledge the \r\ncontribution to international peace and security made \r\nby Japan and India and include them as permanent \r\nmembers. Japan is a major financial contributor to \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions and a leader in \r\ndeveloping peacebuilding activities. India is an \r\nemerging economy with over 1 billion people. We also \r\nenvisage that an expanded Council would include \r\nappropriate representation for Africa, a region \r\ncomprising over one quarter of United Nations \r\nMember States, and for Latin America. \r\n Australia recognizes that any increase in \r\nnon-permanent membership will need to balance the \r\nrepresentation of regional groups that have changed in \r\nsize since the last expansion, particularly Eastern \r\nEurope and Asia. We also believe the expansion of the \r\nCouncil should not be so large as to diminish its ability \r\nto fulfil its responsibilities under the Charter. \r\n Australia still believes a particularly important \r\naspect of Security Council reform is that of its working \r\nmethods. While the process of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations could be lengthy, there are measures that \r\nwe could undertake today to improve the decision-\r\nmaking ability of the Council and the openness and \r\ntransparency of its processes, including access by \r\nnon-members. \r\n Australia considers that reform of the \r\nmembership and working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil is vital to enhancing the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Organization’s capacity to fulfil \r\nthe goals set out in the Charter. The commencement of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations will be timely, and \r\nAustralia looks forward to contributing constructively \r\nthroughout that process. \r\n Ms. Ochir (Mongolia): Let me begin by thanking \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Jorge Urbina, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Costa Rica and President of the \r\nSecurity Council during the month of November, for \r\npresenting the report of the Security Council (A/63/2) \r\nto the General Assembly on behalf of the Council. My \r\ndelegation would also like to thank His Excellency \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the General Assembly \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 22 \r\n \r\nat its sixty-second session, and the members of his task \r\nforce — the Permanent Representatives of Bangladesh, \r\nChile, Djibouti and Portugal — for their hard work to \r\nmove the process forward during the previous session. \r\n The sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly made a historic breakthrough in the long-\r\nstalled process of Security Council reform with the \r\nunanimous adoption of decision 62/557, which \r\nconcluded our preparatory phase for launching \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. And now, we believe, \r\nthe time has come to seize that momentum and move \r\nforward expeditiously. \r\n The last two meetings of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on Security Council Reform have \r\nvividly revealed that a large majority of Member States \r\nare willing and ready to engage in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations as soon as possible. In \r\nthat respect, my delegation regrets that it was found \r\nsomehow impossible to start the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on 21 November this year, as originally \r\nproposed by His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, President of the General Assembly, in his \r\nletter of 10 October 2008. However, we remain hopeful \r\nthat the intergovernmental negotiations will start soon \r\nand are eagerly looking forward to new dates being \r\nannounced by the President of the General Assembly, \r\nas he has stated that “A better Council cannot wait until \r\ntomorrow, if we want to have a better tomorrow” \r\n(A/63/PV.53). We also remain encouraged by the \r\ndetermination and commitment of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to implement the letter and the spirit \r\nof decision 62/557. \r\n My delegation shares the view, expressed by \r\nmany, that having considered the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters over the \r\ncourse of the past 15 years, the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup has already made its contribution to the process \r\nand has largely exhausted its potential. We would only \r\nwelcome it if the Open-ended Working Group \r\nsomehow came up with constructive recommendations \r\nover the next few weeks. But either way, whether the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group produces an outcome or \r\nnot, its work should not in any way stall the start of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council and the ensuing \r\nprocess. \r\n As we are poised to start the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, I would like to reaffirm the principled \r\nposition of Mongolia on Security Council reform. \r\nMongolia has consistently stood for a just and \r\nequitable enlargement of the Security Council by \r\nincreasing the number of both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members, while ensuring due \r\nrepresentation of developing and developed countries \r\nalike. \r\n We also believe that the Security Council needs \r\nto further improve its working methods. This is part \r\nand parcel of a comprehensive reform package. Taking \r\nnote of last August’s open debate of the Security \r\nCouncil on its working methods (see S/PV.5968), we \r\nsupport the proposal of Costa Rica, Jordan, \r\nLiechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland — Small \r\nFive States — aimed at enhancing the accountability, \r\ntransparency and inclusiveness of the Council’s work \r\nwith a view to strengthening its legitimacy and \r\neffectiveness. We also believe that open debates and \r\ninteractive briefings by the Security Council are a \r\ncommendable practice to be further enhanced to the \r\nbenefit of non-members. \r\n As to the report of the Security Council, we \r\nsupport the view that its content needs more in-depth \r\nanalysis and that relevant amendments to that effect \r\ncould be introduced into the provisional rules of \r\nprocedure of the Security Council. We would also like \r\nto commend the innovative efforts of the Permanent \r\nMission of Viet Nam, which sought to interact with \r\nnon-members before the finalization of the Security \r\nCouncil report. We believe that that initiative could \r\nalso be followed by future Presidents of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to assure the President \r\nof the General Assembly of my delegation’s full \r\nsupport for his efforts to move forward with Security \r\nCouncil reform through the launching of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations and to steer the conduct \r\nof the negotiations together with Ambassador Tanin in \r\nthe spirit outlined. Let us come together, keep together \r\nand work together. \r\n Mr. Cancela (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nUruguay, as it has already indicated on previous \r\noccasions, shares the view that Security Council \r\nreform is a matter of urgency. We deem this process \r\nnecessary, on one hand, in order to comply with the \r\nmandate given us by the heads of State and \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n23 08-60935 \r\n \r\nGovernment in 2005 and, on the other, because there is \r\nthe need for the Council to adapt to current \r\ncircumstances so as to confront the new challenges. We \r\nwould like the Council to be a more effective, \r\nrepresentative, democratic and transparent body. To \r\nthat end, reform must also encompass the Council’s \r\nworking methods.  \r\n We welcome the circulation of the resolution of \r\nlast year’s General Assembly on the subject in \r\nquestion, which was orally amended in one of the last \r\nsessions presided over by your predecessor. The \r\nresolution definitively clarified the main points decided \r\nupon during that session, although the process of its \r\ndevelopment was, quite frankly, confused. We would \r\nalso like to welcome the decision on the timetable for \r\nthe meetings of these various negotiations, in particular \r\nthe call to begin intergovernmental negotiations by \r\n21 November next year. However, I must note with \r\nsincerity that we would have liked the presidency to \r\ncarry out broader consultations, in particular with \r\nregional groups, in drawing up the calendar for these \r\nmeetings, since such important occasions should enjoy \r\nthe strongest possible guarantees of transparency. \r\n With regard to the negotiations, Uruguay does not \r\nwish to repeat its position on Security Council reform. \r\nThat position is already well known and has remained \r\nunchanged throughout all the sessions of the Open-\r\nended Working Group. We would, however, like to \r\nreiterate one point that has been central to all the \r\nstatements by the delegation of Uruguay, namely, our \r\nfirm opposition to all solutions that grants the right to \r\nveto to new members of the Security Council, either \r\ndirectly or indirectly, through moratoriums or any other \r\nmechanism aimed at prolonging the extension of that \r\nright over time. \r\n Uruguay’s principled position can be traced back \r\nto the very establishment of the Organization. In the \r\nSan Francisco Conference, the delegation of Uruguay \r\nstated that members of the Security Council should \r\nenter that body without distinction as to prerogative or \r\nrights, while accepting that those countries that had \r\ncarried the greatest burden in the war be assured seats \r\non the Council but not indefinitely and only for a \r\nperiod that might be judged advisable, say eight or ten \r\nyears, for example. \r\n We are about to begin a phase of direct \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, as called for by \r\nvarious delegations seeking to overcome the \r\ndifficulties encountered by the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup. All issues will be on the table, but we cannot \r\nignore the fact that many topics have already been \r\ndebated for more than 12 years and that no agreement \r\nhas been reached on them. Thus, we do not believe it \r\nprudent to continue, for the moment, with questions on \r\nwhich we know we will not reach a consensus or a \r\nbroad majority. We understand that the topic of the \r\nveto is among those questions. \r\n Mr. Park In-kook (Republic of Korea): I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\norganizing this debate. I would also like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Security Council for this month, His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Urbina of Costa Rica, for \r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council. We \r\nappreciate the informative content of the report, as well \r\nas the intensive work undertaken by the Council during \r\nthe period covered by the report. \r\n Today I would like to focus on the vital issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform. It is the view of my \r\ndelegation that meaningful reform should uphold the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations in order \r\nto render the Council more representative, accountable, \r\ntransparent, efficient and democratic. My delegation is \r\nin favour of enhancing the democratic legitimacy of \r\nthe Security Council through an increase in elected \r\nmembers with terms of varying duration. Only through \r\nelections can democracy and accountability be \r\nsustained; not just a single election that entitles the \r\nwinners to remain in office in perpetuity but periodic \r\nelections, whereby Member States will have the \r\nopportunity to review the performance of Council \r\nmembers and respond accordingly. Similarly, only \r\nthrough elections can the door of opportunity be \r\nopened to qualified Member States to present their \r\ncandidatures in the hope of serving the international \r\ncommunity in the pursuit of international peace and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n An integral part of reforming the Security \r\nCouncil is improving its working methods. We must \r\nmeet the goal, agreed upon in the World Summit \r\nOutcome document, of making the Council more \r\nefficient and transparent, further enhancing its \r\neffectiveness, legitimacy and the implementation of its \r\ndecisions. We welcome the proposals that have been \r\nput forward so far to enhance the transparency, \r\naccountability and inclusiveness of the Council’s work. \r\nWe support the steps taken so far by the Council in this \r\nregard and believe that consistent effort should be \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 24 \r\n \r\nmade to improve the working methods on an ongoing \r\nbasis. \r\n Our Working Group has been mandated to \r\naddress the framework and modalities in order to \r\nprepare and facilitate the international negotiations in \r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 62/557. I \r\nthink we are now on the right track, in the sense that \r\nmany Member States have shown their understanding \r\nand agreement on the sequential link between the \r\npreparatory work to be undertaken by the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group and the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nto be launched no later than the end of February 2009. \r\nIt was in this vein that my delegation, together with \r\nthat of Mexico, presented a joint proposal on a draft \r\ntimetable for consultations to the last Open-ended \r\nWorking Group meeting. My delegation is fully \r\ncommitted to working towards the successful launch of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations no later than the end of \r\nFebruary. We propose that we make the best use of the \r\ntime remaining to utilize the Working Group as a \r\npreparatory committee for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, as proposed by Mexico in previous \r\nmeetings of the Open-ended Working Group. \r\n We should now start conducting open, transparent \r\nand inclusive consultations, with a view to making the \r\nmost accurate possible assessment and agreement on \r\nthe framework and modalities. In doing so, we will be \r\nable to draw on the progress made thus far in the Open-\r\nended Working Group, in particular, the reports of the \r\nfacilitators and the work of the task force. The \r\naccumulation of progress made in the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group is embodied in paragraph (e) of \r\ndecision 62/557. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to reiterate several \r\npoints on the issue of the framework and modalities of \r\nnegotiations. First, as a matter of principle, we should \r\naim to achieve the widest possible political acceptance \r\nby the membership and, in any case, well above the \r\nrequired two-thirds majority in the General Assembly. \r\nMember States have time and time again come together \r\nas an overwhelming majority to adopt important \r\nreforms, as eloquently observed yesterday by the \r\nAmbassador of Italy, as they did in adopting landmark \r\nresolution 1991 (XVIII) on 17 December 1963, which \r\nonly increased the number of non-permanent members \r\nfrom 11 to 15. This objective is also stipulated in the \r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group contained in \r\ndocument A/61/47. The rationale is clear — the impact \r\nof the reform of the Security Council on the \r\nmembership is of such magnitude that we cannot afford \r\nto alienate a significant portion of the membership. \r\n Secondly, Security Council reform is comprised \r\nof extremely delicate and complex elements that need \r\nto be addressed in a comprehensive and organic \r\nmanner. All the key issues are so closely interlinked \r\nand all-encompassing that it would not make sense to \r\narbitrarily dissect them and deal with them separately. \r\nSecurity Council reform is a comprehensive issue that \r\nrequires holistic approaches by which all the relevant \r\nissues are discussed in tandem with one another.  \r\n Thirdly, the negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform should build on the progress made thus far, in \r\nparticular, the work of the sixty-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation agrees with the \r\nfacilitators’ conclusion that intermediate approaches \r\nare the only feasible compromise option that can break \r\nthe current impasse. As their report points out, \r\nflexibility is key in moving forward on Security \r\nCouncil reform. At this stage, it is reasonable to \r\nconsider the best possible solution. We believe that the \r\nfacilitators’ report could be a point of convergence that \r\nmight serve as a basis for inclusive negotiations. \r\n Lastly, my delegation reiterates the following \r\nobjectives and guiding principles of Security Council \r\nreform. First, the sovereign equality of Member States \r\nmust be respected. Secondly, equitable geographic \r\ndistribution must be ensured. Thirdly, the democratic \r\nunderpinnings of the Council to enhance its \r\naccountability to the membership must be \r\nstrengthened. Fourthly, ownership of the reform must \r\nbe solidified through the accommodation of interests of \r\nall Member States and of regional and other groupings, \r\nin particular, those that have been traditionally \r\nunderrepresented. Fifthly, we must increase the \r\nopportunity for all Member States to serve on the \r\nSecurity Council, particularly groups that have been \r\nhistorically underrepresented, such as small and \r\nmedium-sized States, as well as African States. In this \r\nregard, we hope to continue our dialogue with all \r\ninterested Member States with a view to finding ways \r\nto address their concerns and interests. \r\n The Republic of Korea has always been ready to \r\nembark on a negotiations process with a view to \r\nreaching our common goal of a comprehensive and \r\ntimely reform of the Security Council. We are willing \r\nto participate in consultations and negotiations in a \r\nflexible way, based on our principled positions. It is \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n25 08-60935 \r\n \r\nour hope that Member States and groups will also show \r\ngreater flexibility, political will and commitment, in \r\norder to advance Security Council reform. \r\n Mr. Çorman (Turkey): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the President for convening this joint meeting \r\nwhich provides a very timely opportunity to reflect on \r\nthe activities of the Security Council as well as on the \r\nCouncil’s ongoing process of reform. \r\n I would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Jorge Urbina of Costa Rica, President of \r\nthe Security Council, for presenting the annual report \r\nof the Council to the General Assembly (A/63/2). \r\n The report provides an accurate account of the \r\nwork of the Security Council and demonstrates the \r\nmultiplicity of issues considered by the Council under \r\nits responsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. It also confirms the increased \r\nworkload of the Council whereby African issues, \r\nparticularly within the context of peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding efforts, remain at the forefront of its \r\nagenda. Finally, the report points to many of the \r\nimportant challenges which lie ahead for the Council, \r\nalbeit indirectly, as well as the challenges that await \r\nour Organization as a whole. \r\n While the report could have been more analytical \r\nand less descriptive, we are also well aware of the \r\ncomplexity of many of the issues that are featured on \r\nthe Council’s agenda — a complexity that would have \r\nrendered such an analytical approach extremely \r\ndifficult to implement. That said, there is still much \r\nroom for further improvement of the working methods \r\nof the Council to enhance its transparency, \r\naccountability and inclusiveness. We therefore \r\nencourage the Council to continue its efforts to that \r\nend. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to briefly \r\nreiterate Turkey’s position on Security Council reform. \r\nAs we have emphasized on numerous occasions, \r\nTurkey remains fully committed to an early reform of \r\nthe Council that will render the Council more \r\ndemocratic, representative and transparent. We believe \r\nthat such an approach will further increase the \r\nlegitimacy and credibility of our Organization. We also \r\nbelieve that these widely shared general principles \r\nshould continue to guide our efforts in every stage of \r\nthe reform process.  \r\n In addition, while focusing on Council reform, \r\nwe should not overlook the other important \r\ncomponents of the reform process at the United \r\nNations, particularly the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. In fact, the reform of the Security Council \r\nand the revitalization of the General Assembly are \r\ninevitably two interrelated issues and should proceed \r\nsimultaneously. \r\n My country has taken an active part in the \r\ndiscussions and consultations that are under way in the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council \r\nreform. We attach importance to the Working Group, \r\nwhich, as the main forum for this discussion, should set \r\nthe stage for the intergovernmental negotiations that \r\nwill soon start informally at the General Assembly. In \r\nour opinion, setting the stage means completing the \r\nconsultations and discussions in the Working Group on \r\nthe main parameters of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. With these considerations in mind, we \r\nhave lent our support to the proposal by Mexico and \r\nthe Republic of Korea on scheduling several more \r\nmeetings of the Working Group prior to the start of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations by February 2009. \r\n We believe that, with sufficient preparation prior \r\nto these negotiations and mutual flexibility to be \r\ndemonstrated by all parties, we will be able to bring \r\nthe process of Security Council reform to a successful \r\nconclusion. The General Assembly may count on our \r\ndelegation’s full cooperation, support and flexibility in \r\nthis process. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to \r\nwelcome the convening of this meeting because of its \r\nimportance to the consideration of the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council and of the United Nations system in \r\ngeneral. Likewise, we would like to acknowledge the \r\nreport of the Security Council presented to us by \r\nAmbassador Jorge Urbina, Permanent Representative \r\nof Costa Rica, in his capacity as President of the \r\nSecurity Council for November 2008. We would also \r\nlike to highlight the work carried out by Ambassador \r\nLe Luong Minh, Permanent Representative of Viet \r\nNam, in the preparation of the report in question.  \r\n The changes to the international scene following \r\nthe end of the cold war reaffirmed the need to \r\nencourage discussions on adapting the United Nations \r\nand its bodies, especially the Security Council, to \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 26 \r\n \r\ncurrent realities in order to allow them to effectively \r\nrespond to the challenges of peace, security and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n As members are aware, the General Assembly \r\nadopted decision 62/557 by consensus, renewing the \r\nmandate of the Open-ended Working Group on the \r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase \r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other \r\nMatters Related to the Security Council. The Assembly \r\napproved an ambitious plan to move from the \r\ndiscussions that have been taking place to the phase of \r\neffective intergovernmental negotiations within the \r\nframework of the Assembly itself. As the President of \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez \r\nFrías, said during the interactive dialogue that took \r\nplace at the Millennium Summit, the United Nations \r\ncannot continue to navigate with a map dating from \r\n1945.  \r\n Venezuela has expressed its support for an \r\nincrease in the number of both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent Security Council members and has \r\nrepeatedly advocated the suppression of the use of the \r\nveto. An agreement on that matter would make the \r\nCouncil more representative and reflect the new, \r\ncurrent composition of the United Nations.  \r\n We have likewise expressed support for countries \r\nof the developing world, from Africa, Asia, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, respectively, being \r\nincluded in the Council as permanent members. Such a \r\ndecision would serve to crown the legitimate aspiration \r\nof peoples and countries that have not been able to \r\nexercise this responsibility for over 60 years.  \r\n Venezuela believes that the inclusion in the \r\nSecurity Council of new permanent members \r\nrepresenting regions of the developing world would be \r\nan appropriate measure to correct the asymmetries of \r\npower in that organ. A multipolar world is taking \r\nshape. The hegemonic positions inherited from the \r\nSecond World War must be overcome, and current \r\nrealities must be expressed in the composition of the \r\nmajor bodies of the United Nations.  \r\n Our country also advocates an increase in the \r\nnumber of new non-permanent members, bearing in \r\nmind the principle of equitable geographic distribution \r\nenshrined in Article 23 of the United Nations Charter. \r\nThe Government of Venezuela expresses its firm \r\nopposition to the veto power, since it is an \r\nanachronistic decision-making mechanism and is \r\ncontrary to the principle of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates enshrined in the letter and spirit of the Charter. \r\nThe issue of the veto is inseparable from that of reform \r\nand expansion. Both objectives will contribute to the \r\ndemocratization of this global forum.  \r\n With a view to achieving the elimination of the \r\nveto in the future, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela favours, on an immediate basis, the \r\nregulation of the use of the veto through the \r\nestablishment of certain criteria, which should be \r\napplied to issues of both procedure and substance. \r\nAlong those lines, it could be considered that, for \r\nsituations involving a threat to or a breach of peace in \r\nsitu, in accordance with the nature and scope of \r\nChapter VII of the Charter, two concurrent negative \r\nvotes of Council member States would be required to \r\nprevent the adoption of a decision. Likewise, the veto \r\nwould not be used in decisions under Chapter VI of the \r\nCharter, which lays out guidelines for the pacific \r\nsettlement of disputes. \r\n In terms of the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil, we recognize that, in recent years, some small \r\nprogress has been made. Nevertheless, this progress \r\nremains insufficient, since it does not duly reflect the \r\ncalls for greater openness and transparency in the \r\nfunctioning of that organ.  \r\n Peace is a matter for everyone, be they small \r\nStates or large States, rich or small. Peace should not \r\nbe supported by privilege, and Venezuela therefore \r\nexpresses its rejection of the practice — and there have \r\nbeen efforts to implement this — of making a rule of \r\nclosed and informal meetings. That type of meeting \r\nshould be an exemption. The predominant rule should \r\nbe public meetings, as established in rule 48 of the \r\nCouncil’s provisional rules of procedure. That type of \r\nproceeding prevents greater participation by the \r\nmajority of Member States in the daily life of the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n We cannot advocate the democratization of \r\ninternational relations or the promotion of democracy \r\nin countries while defending the status quo, which \r\nexcludes and marginalizes the majority of Member \r\nStates when it comes to taking major decisions. In a \r\nspirit of greater transparency, openness and \r\nparticipation, the Security Council should hold \r\nconsultations with the countries affected by its \r\ndecisions. Non-member countries should be invited to \r\nparticipate in informal consultations using a procedure \r\n A/63/PV.55\r\n \r\n27 08-60935 \r\n \r\nsimilar to that established in Articles 31 and 32 of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter.  \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela believes \r\nthat efforts to reform the United Nations should \r\nnecessarily strengthen the General Assembly, the \r\nOrganization’s main body for deliberation and \r\npolicymaking and the most representative body of the \r\nOrganization. In this context, in order to ensure the \r\nnecessary level of Council accountability to the \r\nMember States, the Council should submit periodic, \r\nsubstantive and analytical reports to the Assembly. The \r\ncurrent method applied by the Council of presenting \r\nannual reports that are only factual in nature has not \r\nproduced the desired results. Let the Council render a \r\nregular, systematic account of its activities to the \r\nAssembly in accordance with Articles 15 and 24 of the \r\nCharter.  \r\n To conclude, I wish to reiterate the support of my \r\ndelegation for your work, Sir, as head of the Working \r\nGroup. We hope that Ambassador Zahir Tanin, \r\nPermanent Representative of Afghanistan, in his role as \r\nfacilitator, will direct with moderation and equanimity \r\nthe work in the negotiations phase in the Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): We thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening this \r\nmeeting. We would like to align ourselves with the \r\nstatement delivered by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Mauritius in his capacity as Chairman of the African \r\nGroup. We would also like to commend the President \r\nof the Security Council for the month of November, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Costa Rica, for presenting \r\nthe annual report of the Council (A/63/2), and the \r\ndelegation of Viet Nam for preparing the report. \r\n The annual report of the Security Council before \r\nus indicates the many areas all over the world, \r\nparticularly in Africa, where the Council remains \r\nengaged in helping to resolve conflicts. The Council \r\nalso stimulated constructive debate on important global \r\nissues such as security sector reform, the role of \r\nwomen in peacekeeping operations and the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and regional organizations in \r\nterms of Chapter VIII of the Charter. The Council’s \r\nsustained engagement on these issues is testimony to \r\nwhat it can achieve when it fully and robustly assumes \r\nits responsibilities in terms of the Charter. \r\n At the same time, we must unfortunately lament \r\nthe fact that the Security Council has not been as \r\nsuccessful in resolving some conflict situations or has \r\nfailed dismally to intervene in others. The most serious \r\nthreat to the credibility of the Council remains its \r\ninability to resolve protracted conflicts, such as in \r\nPalestine and Western Sahara. It is our hope that the \r\nCouncil will stem the erosion of its credibility by \r\ntranscending its divisions and the national interests of \r\nits members and by uniformly discharging its Charter-\r\nbased mandate to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Membership on the Security Council confers a \r\nglobal responsibility in that all its members are \r\nentrusted with the task of helping to advance peace \r\nthroughout the world. South Africa does not accept a \r\nstatus quo where some issues on the agenda of the \r\nCouncil, such as anti-terrorism, non-proliferation and \r\nthe Western Sahara, are regarded as the preserve of \r\nsome countries to the exclusion of others. \r\n Over the past two days, we have heard an \r\noverwhelming call for a fundamental reform of the \r\nCouncil. All that remains is for us to commit to \r\nimplementing decision 62/557, unanimously endorsed \r\non 15 September by this Assembly. Through that \r\nwatershed decision, the general membership of the \r\nUnited Nations decided to move away from a process \r\nof endless consultations on the issue of the reform of \r\nthe Council and to commence meaningful, direct \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in informal plenary of \r\nthe General Assembly during its sixty-third session, but \r\nnot later than 28 February 2009. \r\n As you indicated, Sir, in your statement of \r\n11 November, there is a need to implement that \r\ndecision in letter and spirit. Decision 62/557 indicates \r\nthat positions and proposals of Member States, regional \r\ngroups and other Member State groupings shall form \r\nthe basis for the intergovernmental negotiations. We \r\nbelieve that the positions of Member States, regional \r\ngroupings and other Member State groupings are quite \r\nclear and have been presented over and over again. The \r\nbasis, therefore, for starting intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations does exist.  \r\n As for my delegation, we are on record as \r\nsupporting the African position as espoused in the \r\nEzulwini consensus. We also have a clear African \r\nUnion Summit mandate to participate in the \r\nforthcoming intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nbasis of the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. \r\nWe should also proceed with the negotiations by \r\nclustering issues, as indicated in paragraph (e) (ii) of \r\nA/63/PV.55  \r\n \r\n08-60935 28 \r\n \r\ndecision 62/557, and focus on the following five key \r\nissues: categories of membership; the question of the \r\nveto; regional representation; size of an enlarged \r\nCouncil, and working methods of the Council, as well \r\nas the relationship between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n South Africa would have no problem with the \r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of \r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nRelated to the Security Council meeting as many times \r\nas it wishes to consult on all matters related to the \r\nreform of the Security Council. In fact, paragraph (f) of \r\nthe decision decides that the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup should continue to exert efforts during the \r\npresent session of the General Assembly aimed at \r\nachieving general agreement among Member States.  \r\n However, looking at the substance of the issues \r\nproposed for discussion, my delegation is concerned \r\nthat it seems that we again want to rehash and repeat  \r\n \r\nthe same consultative discussions the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group has had over the past 15 years, which \r\nunfortunately have not been very helpful in moving the \r\nprocess of the reform forward. Decision 62/557 was \r\nsignificant, as it moved the process away from ongoing \r\nconsultations and ushered us into direct meaningful \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We cannot reopen, \r\nrenegotiate or amend that decision in any way. All \r\nMember States signed up to that decision unanimously, \r\nas is, and it must now be implemented in letter and \r\nspirit, as is. \r\n In conclusion, South Africa strongly urges you, \r\nSir, to convene the informal plenary of the General \r\nAssembly to commence intergovernmental negotiations \r\nas soon as it is possible. We shall participate in this \r\nprocess in good faith, with high expectations, in the \r\nhope that we can make progress on the issue of reform \r\nof the Security Council during the present session. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n"
