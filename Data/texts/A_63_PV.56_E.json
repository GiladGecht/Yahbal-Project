(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Cujba \r\n(Republic of Moldova), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 9 and 111 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/63/2) \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters  \r\n \r\n Miss Alipate (Tonga): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Pacific small island developing States, \r\nnamely Fiji, Nauru, the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nthe Marshall Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, \r\nSamoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my \r\nown country, the Kingdom of Tonga. We welcome the \r\nopportunity to contribute to this discussion on agenda \r\nitem 9, on the report of the Security Council, and \r\nagenda item 111, on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters.  \r\n We wish to commend the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Costa Rica, the current President of \r\nthe Security Council, for his presentation of the annual \r\nreport of the Council (A/63/2) on behalf of its \r\nmembers.  \r\n When we embarked on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, it was with a vision to make the Council more \r\nrepresentative, more effective, more efficient and more \r\nrelevant. It has to live up to the realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. This is imperative, given the concerns of \r\nthe Council’s increased workload and the consequent \r\noverstretching of its capacity. \r\n In 2001, the Secretary-General pledged to move \r\nthe United Nations from a culture of reaction to a \r\nculture of prevention, specifically encouraging the \r\nSecurity Council to consider innovative mechanisms as \r\nwell as any other early warning or prevention cases \r\nbrought to its attention by Member States. \r\n Opinions that sudden threats to international \r\npeace and security, such as climate change, should not \r\nbe dealt with by the Security Council deny the very \r\nrole which the Charter has assigned to it and clearly \r\ncontradict the very spirit of the current reform process. \r\nThe Security Council is not only competent, but also \r\nmandated to deal with threats to international peace \r\nand security. It is of utmost importance to all organs of \r\nthe United Nations to fulfil their respective mandates. \r\n The solution is therefore not to limit the scope of \r\nthe work of the Council. The increased workload of the \r\nCouncil is reflective of the changing times and \r\nevolving challenges. Consequently, the solution has to \r\ninclude flexibility and relevance. The capacity of the \r\nCouncil needs to be enhanced so it can be flexible \r\nenough to take on new challenges within its purview as \r\nstipulated in the Charter. Thus, we should continue to \r\nfocus on how to make the Security Council more, not \r\nless, relevant to address today’s threats. \r\n In terms of improving the transparency of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods, we maintain our support \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 2 \r\n \r\nfor an increased amount of open debates and meetings, \r\nprovisions for more regular structured briefings to \r\naddress the concerns of non-members, an increased \r\nlevel of input in the decision-making process from the \r\nUnited Nations membership for determining the format \r\nfor particular Council meetings, improving the \r\neffectiveness of the wrap-up sessions and encouraging \r\nand facilitating improved interaction with troop-\r\ncontributing countries by conducting regular meetings \r\nto discuss substantive matters and concerns. This is \r\nparticularly relevant for those troop contributors which \r\nare not members of the Security Council. \r\n On the issue of equitable representation and the \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council, the \r\nSecurity Council should be more broadly \r\nrepresentative of the international community as a \r\nwhole and the geopolitical realities of today. To \r\nachieve these goals, the Council should be expanded \r\nboth in permanent and non-permanent categories. We \r\nare of the view that during the debate on the topic, \r\nwhich has continued over a period of 14 years, we have \r\nhad ample opportunity to express our opinions on the \r\nmatter.  \r\n We welcome the decision by the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to convene the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in an informal plenary on 21 November \r\n2008 and pledge our support and hope for a successful \r\nand speedy conclusion. \r\n Mr. Lima (Cape Verde) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for having convened this meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to discuss the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/63/2) on agenda item 111, the question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. \r\n We listened carefully to the introductory \r\nstatement by the President of the Security Council, \r\nMr. Jorge Urbina of Costa Rica. We also listened to his \r\nenlightening comments made in his national capacity \r\nand would like to thank him for his presentation of \r\nrelevant comments and his frankness in analysing the \r\nfunction of this important organ of the United Nations.  \r\n Everything that has been said in the debate on \r\nthis subject up to this point can only encourage us to \r\ncontinue to work towards change and to break with \r\nsometimes old-fashioned approaches and a system that, \r\nas we see by its deficiencies in transparency, has seen \r\nits day. From this point going forward, we need more \r\ninclusive work to make the Security Council truly an \r\ninstrument for the governance of the world, in sync \r\nwith the twenty-first century. \r\n The world has changed. The aspirations that have \r\nseen light since the creation of the United Nations are \r\nnot based on the relationship of force inherited from \r\nthe last World War, but on shared ideals and renewed \r\nfaith in modernity. Of course, we are still facing so \r\nmany historic challenges, but the world of 2008 is not \r\nthe world of 1948. This has to be understood once and \r\nfor all. \r\n Those who were irreconcilable enemies are now \r\nworking together to design a way forward towards a \r\nfuture of progress and a world at peace for their \r\ndescendants. Those who were colonized are sovereign \r\ntoday, those who had suffered under apartheid are now \r\nin charge of their country, those who were treated as \r\nunderdeveloped, who suffered from the ostracism of \r\nunjust, inadequate and unequal State relations are now \r\nthe driving forces of progress in the world, having \r\nemerged as respected and respectable economic Powers. \r\n The world has changed. It is no longer possible to \r\nsee its evolution and to build our common future \r\nthrough the lens of a bygone era. My point is that the \r\nstructures and mentalities of the old world that still \r\nexist in United Nations bodies must give way to more \r\nrepresentative structures and mentalities — those of the \r\nemerging twenty-first century that are more adapted to \r\nthe changes we have witnessed. There must be more \r\nopenness to the legitimate demands of the peoples of \r\nthis new world. \r\n For so many years now, we have endlessly \r\ndiscussed reform of the Security Council and it seems \r\nthat each time our efforts are doomed to failure or that \r\nwe keep going around in circles like people involved in \r\nmystical incantations. All of this brings us back to \r\nsquare one where we are denied the hope of moving \r\nforward. \r\n The time has come to abandon this ritual \r\nincantation and to start a new cycle of negotiations \r\nwith the sole goal of success this time around. We need \r\nto resolutely move on to this new decisive stage in \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We need to set aside \r\nthe clever trick and little deals among partners of the \r\nmoment to clearly and persistently tackle the challenge \r\nwith a real political desire to reach lasting solutions \r\nwhich will enable the Security Council to be more \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n3 08-61155 \r\n \r\nefficient, to take into account the views of all and to \r\ntake decisions in the interest of peace, security and the \r\nwell-being of all. \r\n Accordingly, we must accept that the smallest, \r\nmost vulnerable States will have a voice. We must \r\naccept that Africa be duly represented and that its \r\nenormous potential plays in its favour. Africa is not and \r\nwill never be a mere pawn on the chessboard of the \r\nworld. Africa wants to be a full-fledged partner in \r\nbuilding new international relations based on equity, \r\nethics and renewed political determination to build \r\npeace, to handle sustainable development and to take \r\njoint responsibility for climate change. \r\n We seek to get to grips on a solution and not to be \r\na source of problems of the world. Africa wants to \r\ncombat the inequalities of international relations. It \r\nwants to resist the iniquitous jeopardy suffered until \r\nnow. Furthermore, it will always be against the version \r\nof history that wants it to remain subjected, living on \r\nthe crumbs magnanimously left in a world where only \r\nthe powerful remain solvent.  \r\n That is why Africa is calling for — and it is only \r\nfair to accord it — two permanent seats and five \r\nnon-permanent seats, as we have been requesting since \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus. \r\n Intergovernmental negotiations which will soon \r\nbe starting must open the way to a new era of \r\nconstructive discussions about and adequate proposals \r\nfor a Security Council that is adapted to the twenty-\r\nfirst century. We should not be subjected to any \r\ndelaying tactics, the consequence of which would be \r\nhard to tolerate. Now we need to lance this abscess. \r\n In this regard, we are pleased to note that the \r\nstatements that we have heard from the beginning of \r\nthis debate are clearer in their proposals, more in \r\naccord with the political will underpinning them and \r\nreveal more profoundly the underlying reasons for \r\nthem. There is a healthy trend in these discussions \r\nwhich bodes well for future debates. \r\n At the same time, a lot of time has been lost in \r\nfruitless or, regrettably, deceiving debates. The \r\ndiscussion we are looking forward to must be open and \r\nnot based on any kind of trickery or delaying tactic. \r\nParticipants must be prepared to accept the ideas and \r\nopinions of all sides. Together we should reduce the \r\ndistance that still separates us, work towards finding \r\ncommon ground and, in a realistic way, give the world \r\na functional, credible, efficient and democratic organ \r\nthat can represent the aspirations of peoples and the \r\nwill of States. We are ready to work with all to create \r\nthat crucial instrument for a better governance of the \r\nworld. \r\n Let us make no mistake about who the \r\nadversaries are in this debate. Let us not seek easy \r\nculprits for our collective inertia or scapegoats with \r\nlow morals. No useless or futile invective about the \r\nintentions or the ulterior motives of one and another in \r\nthis new page that we are opening in the history of that \r\nunique precious body, namely, the Security Council. \r\nAbove all, the small countries are not responsible for \r\nthe current situation. We are all aware of the changes \r\nthat must take place for the Security Council to be \r\nmore effective, more suited to our times and, in \r\nparticular, better able to handle the security of all. We \r\nneed to have the political will to be successful in this \r\ntask, without which we are doomed to this little parlour \r\ngame, in which one gets exhausted in specious \r\nreckoning to figure out who is eligible and who is not, \r\nwho is with whom or who is against what.  \r\n Let us avoid falling into the trap of simplicity, \r\nbecause our designated tasks now are anything but \r\nsimple. Let us not believe that proposals — however \r\nsuch intelligent and legitimate they might be — that \r\ntake into account only the interests of one group to the \r\ndetriment of the others can enable all obstacles to be \r\nremoved, all challenges surpassed and the difficulties \r\novercome. We would like to believe that, but the \r\nexperience of 15 years of endless discussions indicates \r\nthe opposite. Who will take the responsibility of \r\nleading us once again into a dead end?  \r\n I would like to state very clearly that what we \r\nwant now is not to sit in the back rows of a silent film \r\ntheatre, but precisely to participate in solutions to our \r\ncommon problems and to be the guarantors of those \r\nsolutions. What we want is an in-depth change in world \r\ngovernance, so that it can better serve peoples and the \r\ninternational community. What we want is that account \r\nbe taken of the interests of all, in particular, of the \r\nsmallest, the poorest and most vulnerable countries. \r\nThis is not, in our view, about a frantic race to obtain \r\nsome all-powerful right of veto, but about our right to \r\ncontribute, at least to making the veto irrelevant, \r\nthereby shifting the challenges and balance of power \r\ninto another area: that of dialogue and the interests of \r\nall in the face of the great threats of our time. That is \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 4 \r\n \r\nwhy we wish to see the implementation of decision \r\n62/557 as soon as possible. \r\n We would like to begin the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations as soon as possible, but without haste and \r\nwhile safeguarding the work of the existing legitimate \r\norgans. I would not want our Assembly to become a \r\ntalking shop in search of the lost ark of the Security \r\nCouncil. May the negotiations begin and may everyone \r\ntake a stand and express his opinion in all honesty.  \r\n Cape Verde is not one of those countries that \r\npromotes a general position as long as it benefits then. \r\nWe will work in a spirit of openness, watching out for \r\nthe interests of all countries but holding a course set \r\ncollectively with the aim of finding a solution \r\nacceptable to the greatest number and leading towards \r\nthe expected changes in the Security Council. No one \r\nis expected to depend on the ambitions of some or the \r\ninterests of others, however legitimate. No one is \r\nexpected to act as a stepping stone for those who place \r\nindividual goals above collective interests. Like many \r\nwho want to see global governance restored, we want \r\nto serve as a bridge between visions of the world that \r\nare still far from each other. We want to serve as the \r\nanchor point for the constructive convergence of the \r\nvarious possible options. We want to unite, without \r\ntrampling on anyone’s rights, and move towards \r\nconsensus with the consent of all. That is the miracle \r\nthat is expected of us and we know today that we can \r\nsucceed, because nothing is impossible for those who \r\naspire to success. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly takes \r\nnote of the report of the Security Council, contained in \r\ndocument A/63/2? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: Several representatives \r\nhave requested to exercise the right of reply. May I \r\nremind members that statements in the exercise of the \r\nright of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second \r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): Thank you, Sir, for allowing \r\nus to exercise the right of reply. My comments are \r\nrelated to the statement by the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n First, Japan firmly believes that the qualifications \r\nof a given country for permanent membership in the \r\nSecurity Council should be based on that country’s real \r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Since its accession to the United Nations, \r\nJapan, as a nation committed to peace, has worked hard \r\nto promote disarmament and non-proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction, supporting United \r\nNations action for peace and stability in the world, \r\nsuch as peacekeeping operations, and contributing to \r\nworld development and prosperity. \r\n Secondly, it is regrettable that the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea indiscreetly referred to the \r\nabduction issue, the unfortunate past and other issues. \r\nMy delegation cannot accept such a reference. The \r\nabduction issue is a humanitarian matter that needs to \r\nbe resolved. Japan has been facing up to its past with \r\nsincerity and consistency since the end of the Second \r\nWorld War. Japan has always maintained its policy to \r\nresolve any issues, including the abduction and any \r\nterritorial issues, through dialogue and consultations.  \r\n With regard to Japan’s position on Security \r\nCouncil reform, it has been publicly stated many times \r\nin the General Assembly and other forums. It is well \r\nknown that Japan stands ready to contribute actively \r\nand constructively to international peace and security \r\nat any time. \r\n Mr. Hassan (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Yesterday, \r\nwe followed what was said about the Sudan in the \r\nstatement made by the so-called country Saint Vincent. \r\nPerhaps it is the fate of the Sudan, a leading country in \r\nits continent, an African country with a long history \r\nand an old cultural heritage, to have been beleaguered \r\nby the conflict in Darfur, which has opened the door to \r\neach and everyone, from all walks of life, to talk \r\nshamelessly about the Sudan in the manner in which \r\nthe representative of Saint Vincent spoke yesterday. We \r\nwould not have cared and we would not have wanted to \r\nwaste valuable time in these deliberations to reply to \r\ninconsequential and petty remarks. However, the \r\ndelegation of the Sudan asked for the floor to clarify a \r\nfew facts. \r\n First, what the representative of Saint Vincent \r\ndoes not know, or what he perhaps is deliberately \r\nignoring, is that the Security Council, about which he \r\nis talking, sent an international commission of inquiry \r\nto Darfur in 2004. That commission submitted its \r\nreport to the Council at the beginning of 2005, in \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n5 08-61155 \r\n \r\ndocument S/2005/60. He should consult that report, \r\nbecause the report of the commission that visited \r\nDarfur and undertook investigations emphasized \r\ncategorically to the Secretary-General and the Security \r\nCouncil that what is happening in Darfur is not \r\ngenocide and does not even resemble genocide.  \r\n Secondly, of course, we all know that there is one \r\nState, well known to all of us here, which has, unlike \r\nall other members of the international community, \r\ndescribed what is happening in Darfur as genocide. I \r\ndo not need to mention the name of that country, but I \r\nwill mention certain fixed principles. \r\n It is not surprising that major countries with \r\ncolonial interests and ambitions have their own agendas \r\ntowards small, developing nations. That is what \r\nhistory, both past and contemporary, has taught us. It is \r\na pity, however, and regrettably so, that a country, a \r\nfellow developing nation, should come to this forum \r\nnot to express its own position but rather to regurgitate \r\nwhat was taught to it. This is indeed strange. \r\n The report of the Security Council to which the \r\nrepresentative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nrefers does not include a single clause that mentions \r\ngenocide or ethnic cleansing, but if Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines wishes to declare itself a guardian of \r\ninternational peace and security, why did its \r\nrepresentative not have the courage to refer equally to \r\nwhat the world is witnessing now — massacres in \r\nPalestine, Iraq and Afghanistan? Why did he not make \r\neven the slightest reference to those who have tainted \r\nthe international arena and turned international \r\nrelations into a butcher shop? Why did he not mention \r\nthat? Instead, he finds himself shamelessly blaming the \r\nSudan. \r\n The Sudan sees today’s meeting as a forum for \r\ntransparent deliberations by the General Assembly on \r\nthe reform and expansion of the Security Council — \r\nnot on the issue of Darfur. Under no circumstances did \r\nwe expect this forum to be exploited by those who are \r\nbeating the drums of war.  \r\n In conclusion, there is a difference between those \r\nwho express their own position — even if we disagree \r\nwith them — and those who stand here by proxy to \r\nrepeat the words dictated to them by others. \r\n Mr. Chabi (Morocco) (spoke in French): May I \r\nbegin by thanking you, Sir, for allowing my delegation \r\nto exercise its right of reply. \r\n My delegation questions the tenor of the remarks \r\nby the representative of South Africa in our debate on \r\nthe report of the Security Council. He stated that the \r\nSecurity Council was unable to resolve the issue of the \r\nSahara. This is not just a distortion of truth but, even \r\nworse, shows bad faith with regard to one of the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. \r\n The truth is simple; we do not need to disguise it. \r\nAllow me to outline this to the General Assembly and \r\nrecall for the representative of South Africa that the \r\nSecurity Council is playing an active role in putting an \r\nend to these various regional conflicts, pursuant to the \r\nprovisions of the Charter, contrary to the allegations of \r\nthe representative of South Africa. \r\n Over a period of a year and a half, the Security \r\nCouncil has adopted three resolutions of substance \r\nwhich, today, consolidate an entire negotiation process \r\nand have allowed four negotiation rounds to be held. \r\nThis new and promising momentum has been made \r\npossible thanks to our action, which has been \r\nwelcomed by the international community, in particular \r\nby the Security Council, where, need I recall, South \r\nAfrica is indeed present. This is a result of the credible \r\nefforts made by the Kingdom of Morocco. Three \r\nresolutions — 1754 (2007), 1783 (2007) and 1813 \r\n(2008) — were adopted unanimously by the Security \r\nCouncil, with South Africa among them. I would say \r\nhere that resolution 1813 (2008) was adopted on \r\n30 April 2008 under the South African presidency of \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n My country is certainly not alone in observing a \r\ncertain incoherence between South Africa’s desire to \r\nplay a main role on our continent on the one hand and, \r\non the other, its inclination to undermine and diminish \r\nthe patient work which the Security Council has carried \r\nout with regard to the Sahara by adopting a negative \r\nview towards the salutary moves taken to resolve the \r\ndisagreements. Here, we can understand that what is \r\nhappening might be disconcerting for South Africa \r\nbecause it does not tally with its view, which is far \r\nfrom being shared by the majority of Member States. \r\nSouth Africa cannot act as a spoiler or lead this \r\nAssembly astray by ignoring the significant efforts of \r\nthe Security Council and the international community. \r\n Lastly, my country hopes that South Africa will \r\nabandon its biased position and contribute in a neutral, \r\nconstructive and responsible way to a negotiated \r\npolitical solution to the Sahara dispute. Were it to do \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 6 \r\n \r\nso, it would make a contribution to overcoming the \r\ndifficulties and obstacles with regard to the construction \r\nof the Maghreb. My country wishes to see this become \r\nan area of peace, democracy and shared prosperity. \r\n Mr. Shin Boo-nam (Republic of Korea): I would \r\nlike to exercise the right of reply in regard to what the \r\nrepresentative of Japan mentioned about territorial \r\nissues. \r\n I formally reiterate the position of the Republic of \r\nKorea that Dokdo Island has always been an integral \r\npart of our territory, which is proven by historical \r\nrecords, geographical facts and supported by the rules \r\nand principles of international law. \r\n Mr. Sin Song Chol (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): The delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would again like to \r\ncomment on the statement made by the representative \r\nof Japan in this General Assembly. \r\n Whenever opportunities are provided, Japan has \r\npretended that the issue of its past crimes against \r\nhumanity is groundless. This is truly hypocritical and \r\nbrazen-faced behaviour which turns over the facts that \r\nare historically real and proven. As is already well \r\nknown, Japan stands alone as the only country in the \r\nworld that did not even reflect on its tremendous \r\ncrimes against humanity and did not make proper and \r\nhonest reparations. \r\n In the past, Japan forcibly drafted 8.4 million \r\nKoreans, killed more than 1 million and forced more \r\nthan 200,000 women and girls into sexual slavery as \r\ncomfort women for the Japanese army. After its defeat \r\nin the war, Japan destroyed documents related to its \r\ncrimes in fear of having those crimes disclosed to the \r\nworld at large. Destroying documents will not be \r\nenough to delete Japan’s dirty crime-laden traces. \r\n Japan claims that it has apologized for its \r\ntremendous large-scale crimes against humanity, but it \r\nis indeed only a tricky and malicious move to divert \r\ninternational opinion. It is de jure and de facto a \r\ncustomary practice of Japan to say that it has repented \r\nfor its past crimes when it finds itself cornered at a \r\npolitical impasse. And it denies everything it has \r\npromised to do as soon as the environment becomes \r\nmore favourable. \r\n Recently, high-level officials of the Government \r\nof Japan have openly declared and asserted that there is \r\nno evidence or documentation that prove the possible \r\nnature of comfort women with respect to the Japanese \r\narmy; the Government even went so far as to deny \r\ncompletely the involvement of its Government and \r\narmy in these dirty crimes. This is the authentic nature \r\nof Japan’s position towards its blood-stained history. \r\nTo this day, many of the survivors live through pain \r\nand trauma as a result of that sexual slavery. \r\n At present, with formal authorization from and \r\nconnivance by the Japanese Government, factual \r\ncontent about past crimes has been removed from or \r\ndistorted in history textbooks in Japan, and those \r\nresponsible for human slaughter in the past are praised \r\nand honoured as heroes.  \r\n It cannot be denied that that is what is happening \r\nnow. A country like Japan that denies the resolution \r\nonce and for all of the issue of past crimes will surely \r\nrepeat, again and again, the same path of crimes against \r\nhumanity. That is the lesson that we have all learned \r\nthroughout history. That is why we take so seriously \r\nthe issue of Japan’s crimes and its recent political \r\nmoves against the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, including open moves to seize Tok Islet, which \r\nis the sacred territory of Korea, and its violent and \r\norganized repression of Korean residents in Japan.  \r\n If a permanent seat is given to such an \r\nirresponsible and brazen-faced country as Japan, it will \r\nbe the same as encouraging Japan’s ambitions for its \r\nold dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity \r\nSphere, which will give rise to an extremely dangerous \r\nthreat to the entire international community. \r\n Mr. Laher (South Africa): We reiterate our \r\nposition on what we view as the regular working \r\nmethods of the Security Council with regard to \r\naddressing the situation in Western Sahara. Our view is \r\nbased on our experience as a non-permanent of the \r\nSecurity Council for the last two years. We would also \r\nlike to reiterate our view that the Security Council \r\nshould consider the conflict in Western Sahara through \r\na balanced approach, based on the principle of self-\r\ndetermination for the people of Western Sahara. \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): The first remark I would like \r\nto make is with regard to the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea. Japan \r\nmaintains a consistent policy about Takeshima Island, \r\nwhich we will not repeat on this occasion. Both \r\ncountries have their own positions on this issue. \r\nHowever, the important thing is for both countries to \r\nwork together for a mature partnership in the future.  \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n7 08-61155 \r\n \r\n The second remark I would like to make is with \r\nregard to the statement made by the representative of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. With \r\nrespect to our position on the past, we explained our \r\nposition in exercising our right of reply, and I will not \r\nrepeat what I said then. However, I have to mention \r\nthat Japan has conducted talks with the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic on the issue of the resolution of \r\nissues relating to the unfortunate past as part of the \r\nprocess of normalization talks aimed at establishing \r\ndiplomatic relations, and it will continue to do so. The \r\nallegation by the Democratic People’s Republic that \r\nJapan refuses to settle the issue of the past simply does \r\nnot reflect the facts. For our part, we wish to remind \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic that it must take \r\nconcrete steps to advance normalization talks. \r\n Mr. Chabi (Morocco) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to stress that the position of South Africa on the \r\nquestion of the Sahara is not balanced. The partiality of \r\nthe position of that country on the disputes in the \r\nSahara is well known. That country has repeatedly \r\ndemonstrated flagrant bias, contrary to the efforts of \r\nthe international community to resolve this dispute. For \r\nits part, the Kingdom of Morocco remains actively \r\nengaged to find a solution to this question with the \r\nsupport of the international community and under the \r\naegis of the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Sin Song Chol (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): I apologize on behalf of my \r\ndelegation for taking the floor once again. My \r\ndelegation considers that it has the obligation to \r\nreiterate its position with regard to the issue of Japan’s \r\ncrimes, since the Japanese delegation seems not to \r\nunderstand even the essence of its crimes.  \r\n Japan’s crimes are not only issues of the past, but \r\nare also issues of the present. The recent rash acts and \r\nblind behaviour in which Japan has used every possible \r\nmeans and ways to grab Tok Islet, which is the sacred \r\nterritory of Korea, and its flagrant violation of the \r\nhuman rights of Korean residents in Japan and the \r\nrepression of their sovereign right to organize are \r\ntypical examples.  \r\n Crimes perpetrated by Japan can neither be made \r\nto fade away with the passing of days nor be covered \r\nup, no matter how desperately Japan tries to do so. \r\nThat is why the delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea asserts that Japan has no right to \r\nbecome a permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nwhich has the mission of maintaining international \r\npeace and security.  \r\n Japan must, first of all, completely liquidate its \r\ncrimes of the past, if it truly longs to get inspire the \r\ntrust of the international community. Japan’s \r\ninsincerity has reached such an extreme that even its \r\nallies have adopted resolutions urging Japan to \r\nliquidate its past crimes as soon as possible. Japan \r\nwould be wise to think about and follow the examples \r\nshown by other countries in honestly resolving issues \r\nof the past, instead of trying to evade its responsibility.  \r\n With regard to the very irresponsible remark just \r\nmade by the delegation of Japan, no, Tok Islet is fully \r\npart of the sovereign territory of Korea. There is no \r\nroom for further consultation or talks or whatever form \r\nof dialogue there could be. Once again, I reiterate: Tok \r\nIslet is Korean territory.  \r\n That is why we say that Japan is causing \r\ninstability in the North-East Asia region. Through this \r\nkind of very irresponsible statements by the Japanese \r\ndelegation, we can easily see that. The more Japan tries \r\nto evade its responsibility, the more it will lose the \r\ntrust of the international community.  \r\n Mr. Shin Boo-nam (Republic of Korea): I would \r\nlike to exercise the second right of reply regarding the \r\nterritorial issue raised by the Japanese delegate. I \r\nwould like to reiterate the Korean Government’s firm \r\nposition that Tok Islet is not the object of either a \r\ndiplomatic negotiation or a territorial dispute between \r\ntwo countries.  \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 9 and agenda item 111.  \r\n \r\nAgenda item 105 \r\n \r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments \r\n \r\n (a) Appointment of members of the Advisory \r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary \r\nQuestions \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/63/528) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Fifth Committee \r\nrecommends in paragraph 6 of its report that the \r\nGeneral Assembly appoint the following persons as \r\nmembers of the Advisory Committee on Administrative \r\nand Budgetary Questions for a three-year term of office \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 8 \r\n \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2009: Ms. Aїcha Afifi (Morocco); \r\nMs. Renata Archini (Italy); Mr. Vladimir Alekseevitch \r\nIosifov (Russian Federation); Mr. Alejandro Torres \r\nLépori (Argentina); Ms. Susan McLurg (United States \r\nof America). \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto appoint those persons as members of the Advisory \r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions \r\nfor a three-year term of office beginning on 1 January \r\n2009? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\n (b) Appointment of members of the Committee \r\non Contributions \r\n \r\n Report of the Fifth Committee (A/63/529) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In paragraph 4 of the \r\nreport, the Fifth Committee recommends that the \r\nGeneral Assembly appoint the following persons as \r\nmembers of the Committee on Contributions for a \r\nthree-year term of office beginning on 1 January 2009: \r\nMr. Vyacheslav Anatolievich Logutov (Russian \r\nFederation); Mr. Richard Moon (United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland); Mr. Hae-yun Park \r\n(Republic of Korea); Mr. Thomas Thomma (Germany); \r\nMr. Courtney Williams (Jamaica); Mr. Wu Gang \r\n(China). \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto appoint these persons as members of the Committee \r\non Contributions for a three-year term of office \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2009? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n \r\n (c) Confirmation of the appointment of members of \r\nthe Investments Committee \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/63/530) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Fifth Committee \r\nrecommends in paragraph 5 of its report that the \r\nGeneral Assembly confirm the reappointment by the \r\nSecretary-General of Mr. Masakazu Arikawa (Japan), \r\nMr. Madhav Dhar (India) and Mr. Nemir A.

Kirdar (Iraq) as members of \r\nthe Investments Committee for a three-year term of \r\noffice beginning on 1 January 2009 and the \r\nappointment of Ms. Linah Mohohlo (Botswana), to fill \r\nthe remainder of the term of Mr. Khaya Ngqula (South \r\nAfrica), effective 1 January 2009 and expiring on \r\n31 December 2009? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The Acting President: In paragraph 6 of the \r\nsame report, the Fifth Committee also recommends that \r\nthe General Assembly reappoint Mr. Ivan Pictet \r\n(Switzerland) as an ad hoc member for a one-year term \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2009 and Mr. Simon Jiang \r\n(China) as an ad hoc member to replace Ms. Afsaneh \r\nBeschloss (Islamic Republic of Iran) commencing on \r\n1 January 2009. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto reappoint Mr. Ivan Pictet (Switzerland) as an ad hoc \r\nmember of the Investments Committee for a one-year \r\nterm beginning on 1 January 2009 and Mr. Simon Jiang \r\n(China) as an ad hoc member to replace Ms. Afsaneh \r\nBeschloss (Islamic Republic of Iran) commencing on \r\n1 January 2009? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\n (d) Appointment of members of the International \r\nCivil Service Commission \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/63/531) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In paragraph 4 of its \r\nreport, the Fifth Committee recommends that the \r\nGeneral Assembly appoint the following persons as \r\nmembers of the International Civil Service \r\nCommission for a four-year term of office beginning \r\non 1 January 2009: Mr. Fatih Bouayad-Agha (Algeria); \r\nMr. Shamsher Chowdhury (Bangladesh); Mr. Vladimir \r\nMorozov (Russian Federation); Mr. Wang Xiaochu \r\n(China); Mr. El Hassane Zahid (Morocco). \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto appoint those persons as members of the \r\nInternational Civil Service Commission for a four-year \r\nterm of office beginning on 1 January 2009? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n9 08-61155 \r\n \r\n (f) Appointment of members and alternate \r\nmembers of the United Nations Staff Pension \r\nCommittee \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/63/532)  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In paragraph 4 of the \r\nreport, the Fifth Committee recommends that the \r\nGeneral Assembly appoint the following persons as \r\nmembers or alternate members of the United Nations \r\nStaff Pension Committee for a four-year term of office \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2009: Mr. Gerhard Kűntzle \r\n(Germany); Mr. Andrei Vitalievitch Kovalenko (Russian \r\nFederation); Mr. Lovemore Mazemo (Zimbabwe); \r\nMr. Muhammad Muhith (Bangladesh); Mr. Philip \r\nRichard Okanda Owade (Kenya); Ms. Valeria María \r\nGonzález Posse (Argentina); Mr. Thomas Repasch \r\n(United States of America); Mr. Jun Yamada (Japan). \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto appoint those persons as members or alternate \r\nmembers of the United Nations Staff Pension \r\nCommittee for a four-year term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2009? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nsub-items (a) to (c) and (e) to (f) of agenda item 105? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 154 (continued) \r\n \r\nJudges of the International Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991 \r\n \r\n  Letter from the Secretary-General addressed to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly (A/63/548) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Assembly considered this agenda item at its \r\ntwenty-third plenary meeting on 9 October 2008. \r\n In his letter, the Secretary-General refers to \r\narticle 13 bis, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons \r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991, which reads: \r\n  “In the event of a vacancy in the Chambers \r\namongst the permanent judges elected or \r\nappointed in accordance with this article, after \r\nconsultation with the Presidents of the Security \r\nCouncil and of the General Assembly, the \r\nSecretary-General shall appoint a person meeting \r\nthe qualifications of article 13 of the Statute, for \r\nthe remainder of the term of office concerned.” \r\n In that regard, the Secretary-General informs the \r\nAssembly that, on 30 June 2008, Judge Wolfgang \r\nSchomburg notified the Secretariat of his resignation \r\nfrom service with the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia, effective 18 November 2008. After \r\nconsultations with the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-second session and the President \r\nof the Security Council, the Secretary-General appointed \r\nJudge Christoph Flügge to replace Judge Schomburg. \r\n In the absence of a relevant agenda item at its \r\nsixty-second session, the General Assembly could not \r\ntake action on this issue. May I take it that the \r\nAssembly takes note of the appointment of Judge \r\nChristoph Flügge to the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia for the remainder of the term of \r\noffice of Judge Schomburg? \r\n  It was so decided.  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 154. \r\n  The President took the Chair. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 110  \r\n \r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly  \r\n \r\n The President: I have been looking forward to \r\nthis opportunity to take up the issue of the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We will now \r\ncome face to face with concrete proposals that will \r\nenable us to reassert the Assembly’s responsibilities as \r\nthe chief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations in the months ahead.  \r\n As members know, the democratization of the \r\nUnited Nations is the overarching priority of my \r\npresidency. I believe that we need to take radical steps \r\nto regain the authority of the General Assembly so that \r\nit can perform its duties as the most democratic organ \r\nof the United Nations. \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 10 \r\n \r\n We are certainly the most representative body of \r\nthe international system, but I do not think we can say \r\nthat we are the most democratic. Yes, each Member \r\nState has a vote in the Assembly, and that is what \r\nmakes it unique within the international community. \r\nHowever, until the Assembly restores the authority \r\nassigned to it under the Charter, our democracy will \r\nfall short of exercising the real leadership that the \r\nworld requires at this juncture in its history. It is \r\nimperative to re-establish the balance among the \r\nprincipal organs of our Organization and to ensure that \r\nthe powers assigned to each in the Charter are fully \r\nrespected. That is what I see as the ultimate goal of this \r\nprocess of revitalization.  \r\n My predecessor wisely established the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly to, inter alia, identify ways to further \r\nenhance the role, authority, effectiveness and efficiency \r\nof the Assembly. For the first time, the report before us \r\n(A/62/952) provides us with an overview of the \r\nrecommendations and changes that have been made \r\nover the past 16 years of reform efforts.  \r\n We thank the Working Group for presenting us \r\nwith its comprehensive review, and we must now \r\nimplement the recommendations that will improve our \r\nworking methods and our efficiency. The report \r\nidentifies changes that are already helping us to \r\nre-establish the Assembly’s credibility as the chief \r\ndeliberative and policymaking body, and we need to \r\nact on those resolutions not yet implemented that will \r\nfurther streamline our work.  \r\n Before we consider the report prepared by the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group, I would like to make some brief \r\ncomments that will help us move forward to implement \r\nspecific changes that, I believe, we should and can \r\ninstitute during this sixty-third session. I think that we \r\nhave clear opportunities to improve the exchanges \r\nbetween the General Assembly and other United \r\nNations organs and the broader United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies that make up the United Nations \r\nsystem.  \r\n It has been recommended that the Assembly \r\nPresident meet on a monthly basis with the President of \r\nthe Security Council to review its workplan and to \r\nconsult on specific issues of particular concern. I \r\nwould suggest that such meetings take place with the \r\nentire Assembly to permit more direct and dynamic \r\nexchanges between the two organs. The same could be \r\ndone on a periodic basis with the President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, thus providing \r\nopportunities to create more synergy between the \r\nAssembly and that Council.  \r\n I have perceived a sense of isolation in the \r\nspecialized agencies, funds and programmes of the \r\nUnited Nations system in my contacts with colleagues \r\nfrom other duty stations. While they come together \r\nwith the Secretary-General once a year, we would all \r\nbenefit from briefings to the Assembly itself and could \r\nundoubtedly contribute to the important work that they \r\nare doing. Let us find opportunities to host those \r\nexchanges so that they can be both informal and candid \r\nand can provide real added value to our work. \r\n We all agree that the procedures for selecting the \r\nSecretary-General should be formalized. The \r\nSecretariat is an enormously important organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, and the Secretary-General should be \r\nselected in a transparent and inclusive process. Let us \r\nresolve to put into place procedures for the timely \r\nreview of candidates, well before the next election. \r\nThere are many resolutions cited in the report that will \r\nhelp us to put together procedures and to define \r\nimportant parameters for the position, including term \r\nlength and possible re-election. \r\n I am also inspired by the enthusiastic response to \r\nthe exchange between the General Assembly and the \r\npanel of experts that we convened a few weeks ago. \r\nThose consultations on the international financial crisis \r\nbrought all of us together to examine collaboratively \r\nboth the urgency and magnitude of the problem and \r\npractical steps to deal with them, resulting in the \r\nestablishment of a high-level commission that will \r\ncontinue to provide guidance and innovative ideas \r\nregarding how the Assembly can contribute to the new \r\ninternational financial architecture that, as all of us \r\nrecognize, is needed.  \r\n The Assembly has demonstrated new agility in \r\ntaking up urgent issues before us by drawing on the \r\nenormous reserves of expertise that exist within the \r\nUnited Nations system, as well as drawing on experts \r\nin the field. No country alone can convene such diverse \r\nexperts from around the world in such a timely manner. \r\nWe must continue to seize these moments and organize \r\nmeaningful and action-oriented responses.  \r\n Therefore, let us be practical in our response to \r\nthis valuable report and identify opportunities for \r\nimmediate action. That will be the real measure of our \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n11 08-61155 \r\n \r\nvitality and of our determination to provide the \r\ndynamic leadership expected of us. \r\n Mr. Delacroix (France) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. \r\nThe candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the countries of \r\nthe Stabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Ukraine, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Armenia and Georgia, align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n I should like at the outset to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for having convened this meeting on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. The European \r\nUnion would also like to express its gratitude to the \r\nformer Assembly President, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, for his efforts during the sixty-second session \r\nto revitalize the Assembly, in particular by convening \r\nthematic debates on issues relevant to Member States. \r\nThe European Union is confident that you, \r\nMr. President, will continue that process. \r\n The European Union would also like to express \r\nits gratitude to the two co-Chairs, Ambassador Eladio \r\nLoizaga, Permanent Representative of Paraguay, and \r\nAmbassador Andrzej Towpik, Permanent Representative \r\nof Poland, for the work accomplished within the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The European Union has heard well the appeal of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations and the place \r\nthat the General Assembly should take in that regard. \r\nAs members are aware, the European Union is firmly \r\ncommitted to effective multilateralism, with the United \r\nNations given central role in that framework. Our \r\nobjective is to strive to establish an effective \r\nmultilateral system based on international law and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n Strengthening the United Nations is a priority for \r\nEurope. That is why the European Union remains \r\nconvinced that, at this stage, it is essential to move \r\nswiftly ahead with the reforms of the United Nations \r\nsystem decided upon at the 2005 World Summit. We \r\nremain resolved to participate actively in a genuine \r\nconstructive dialogue with all United Nations Members \r\nto push those efforts forward. \r\n The process of reforming United Nations \r\noperational activities remains a priority for the \r\nEuropean Union. Efforts to strengthen the capacity of \r\nUnited Nations bodies to unite their development \r\nactivities should continue. We must also take into \r\naccount cross-cutting issues such as gender equality, \r\nsustainable development and human rights. The \r\nEuropean Union supports the pragmatic from-the-\r\nground-up approach that has been proposed, and we are \r\nconvinced that the lessons learned in the pilot countries \r\nshould play a significant role in comprehensive reform \r\nefforts undertaken at the central level. \r\n The European Union is aware of the need to \r\ncontinue to reform the principal United Nations organs, \r\nin particular the General Assembly, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the Security Council, in order to \r\nimprove the representativity, transparency and \r\neffectiveness of the system. \r\n The authority and functioning of the General \r\nAssembly must be in keeping with the principles set \r\nout in the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nrelevant resolutions. The European Union stresses the \r\nimportance of the full implementation of resolutions \r\nrelated to the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly. In that regard, we have noted with \r\nsatisfaction the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\non the Revitalization of the General Assembly and \r\nwelcome the adoption of resolution 62/276.  \r\n We are counting on the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\non the Revitalization of the General Assembly — \r\nwhich is open to all Member States — to consider \r\nways to strengthen the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the Assembly, in particular on the basis of \r\nits relevant resolutions. More specifically, the \r\nEuropean Union wishes to stress the following points.  \r\n First, the European Union believes that the best \r\nway to effectively revitalize the General Assembly is to \r\nensure the implementation of the resolutions already \r\nadopted on the issue. In that regard, we must have a \r\ntool at our disposal to ensure follow-up on their \r\nimplementation.  \r\n Secondly, in the same spirit, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral could, in his annual report on the work of the \r\nOrganization, present precise information concerning \r\nthe mandates adopted by the General Assembly during \r\nthe year, including information on the status of their \r\nimplementation.  \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 12 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, with regard to the functioning of the \r\nAssembly’s daily work, we believe that further \r\nconsideration should be given to the potential offered \r\nby modern technologies. The voting system could be \r\nduly improved in the context of the provisions — \r\nincluding the financial provisions — of the capital \r\nmaster plan.  \r\n Fourthly, in the same spirit, the European Union \r\ndeplores the late issuance of many reports, which has a \r\nnegative impact on the functioning of intergovernmental \r\nbodies. In that context, we recall the need for timely \r\ndissemination of the necessary documentation in all \r\nofficial United Nations languages. Once and for all, we \r\nmust put an end to the recent trend; the quality and \r\ntimeliness of our debates depend on it. We are counting \r\non you, Mr. President, with the assistance of the \r\nSecretariat, to ensure strict compliance with the \r\nresolutions and rules governing the use of languages in \r\nvarious United Nations organs and forums, rule 51 of \r\nthe General Assembly’s rules of procedure and the \r\nprovisions of resolution 61/266, on multilingualism.  \r\n Fifthly, while recognizing that further progress is \r\nneeded, the European Union welcomes the qualitative \r\nimprovements made in the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\n Sixthly, and finally, with regard to another issue \r\ncurrently being discussed, the European Union recalls \r\nthe importance of implementing the relevant Charter \r\nArticle and resolutions concerning the General \r\nAssembly in the process of selecting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.  \r\n The European Union will be fully involved in the \r\nefforts of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly during this \r\nsixty-third session. We will continue to contribute in a \r\nconstructive and pragmatic manner to the efforts to \r\nimprove the work of the General Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). \r\n At the outset, I would like to express the gratitude \r\nof the members of NAM to Their Excellencies \r\nAmbassador Eladio Loizaga of Paraguay and \r\nAmbassador Andrzej Towpik of Poland for their \r\nexcellent work in co-chairing the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nduring the sixty-second session.  \r\n In adopting resolution 62/276, the General \r\nAssembly decided to continue to assess, during the \r\ncurrent session, the extent to which all its previous \r\nresolutions and decisions related to the revitalization of \r\nthe work of the General Assembly have been \r\nimplemented. At the outset of this debate, the NAM \r\nwould like to recall the validity and relevance of its \r\nprincipled positions regarding this matter. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement reiterates that the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich must be guided by the principles of democracy, \r\ntransparency and accountability and achieved through \r\nconsultations, is a critical component of the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations and that \r\nits objectives should continue to strengthen the role \r\nand position of the General Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement also emphasizes \r\nthat the improvement of the General Assembly’s \r\nprocedural and working methods is only a first step \r\ntowards more substantive improvements aimed at \r\nrestoring and enhancing the role and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, including in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security as stipulated in \r\nArticles 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 35 of the Charter.  \r\n In this respect, the NAM welcomes the decision \r\nby the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nthird session, His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, to put the current meeting under the theme \r\nof the democratization of the United Nations, which \r\nremains intimately linked to the revitalization of the \r\nAssembly.  \r\n The NAM further welcomes the proposal of the \r\nPresident to hold a high-level dialogue on the \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations, including a \r\nmeeting that would focus on the revitalization and \r\nempowerment of the Assembly.  \r\n The NAM, while expressing its readiness to \r\ncontinue to support all ongoing efforts to strengthen \r\nthe central role and authority of the Assembly, wishes \r\nto state that it will oppose any approach that seeks to \r\nundermine or minimize the achievements of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, diminish its current role and \r\nfunctioning or raise questions about its relevance and \r\ncredibility, or could lead to such results. In this respect, \r\nthe NAM notes with growing concern continuous \r\nattempts on the part of the Security Council to \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n13 08-61155 \r\n \r\nencroach upon issues that clearly fall within the \r\nfunctions and powers of other principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations and their subsidiary bodies. The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement underscores, once again, the \r\nneed to fully respect the functions and powers of the \r\nprincipal organs, in particular the General Assembly, \r\nand to maintain the balance among those organs in \r\naccordance with the Charter. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement has previously \r\nexpressed its satisfaction regarding the central role \r\nplayed by the General Assembly both during the \r\npreparatory process of the 2005 World Summit and \r\nduring the follow-up phase, which allowed it to \r\nreassert many of its prerogatives. In the light of the \r\ngravity of the current financial and economic crisis, the \r\nNAM is of the view that the Assembly has an equally \r\nimportant role to play in bringing together all the \r\nmembers of the international community to address \r\nthis issue. On the other hand, members of the NAM \r\nremain convinced that genuine revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly cannot afford to avoid \r\naddressing the main issue of the lack of adequate \r\nresources made available to the Organization as a \r\nwhole. \r\n Finally, the Non-Aligned Movement looks \r\nforward to the establishment of the ad hoc working \r\ngroup on General Assembly revitalization called for by \r\nresolution 62/276 and expresses its readiness to \r\nparticipate, along those lines, in its work in order to \r\narrive at a detailed and fair assessment of the status of \r\nthe implementation of all previous decisions. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I should like to greet you, Mr. President, on \r\nbehalf of my delegation and to underline the efficient \r\nmanner in which you are guiding our work. My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made by \r\nthe Ambassador from Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n The General Assembly is the only universal body \r\nof the United Nations and the principal deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and participative body. Its mandate is \r\ncomprehensive. It includes matters relative to \r\ndisarmament and the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity, as well as economic, social, political and \r\ncooperation matters. In this context, my delegation \r\nassigns great importance to the process of \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and considers it \r\nan essential component of the reform and strengthening \r\nof the Organization. \r\n I would like to express Colombia’s appreciation \r\nto the Ambassadors of Paraguay and Poland for their \r\nwork as facilitators of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the General Assembly. Thanks to \r\ntheir practical approach, today we have a chart that \r\nreflects the status of implementation of the operative \r\nprovisions contained in the resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the Assembly, which should serve as a \r\nmodel to be included in future reports on the matter. \r\nSimilarly, my delegation is pleased by the manner in \r\nwhich the report of the Working Group (A/62/952) \r\nreflects the diversity of the discussions on this issue \r\nduring the previous session. Its contributions are an \r\nimportant starting point for the continued consideration \r\nof this matter. \r\n We believe that in order to achieve positive and \r\ntangible results we must maintain the pragmatic and \r\nrealistic vision exhibited by the facilitators, as \r\nindicated by the President of the Assembly some \r\nmoments ago. Our work must always have as its \r\nobjective the full exercise of the authority of the \r\nAssembly, as well as achieving greater effectiveness \r\nand efficiency in its work. \r\n At the same time, my delegation notes with regret \r\nthat there is not a greater willingness on the part of \r\nMember States to achieve tangible and substantive \r\nresults in the process of revitalization of the Assembly. \r\nWe must recognize that, in spite of the specific \r\nprogress achieved in recent years, the general balance \r\non revitalization remains precarious. We note with \r\nconcern that year after year we repeat the same topics \r\nin our statements without these resulting in effective \r\nAssembly reform. \r\n Considering that this is a topic whose principal \r\nobjective is to strengthen this central body of our \r\nOrganization, we would like to see a list of speakers \r\nfor this debate as extensive as that for the joint debate \r\non the report of the Security Council and the expansion \r\nof its membership. Similarly, attendance at the \r\nmeetings of the Working Group on General Assembly \r\nrevitalization unfortunately pales in comparison with \r\nthat of the Open-ended Working Group on Security \r\nCouncil Reform. The imbalance in the will and interest \r\ndemonstrated for both processes speaks for itself. \r\n In relation to the recommendations included in \r\nthe report of the Working Group, I should like to refer \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 14 \r\n \r\nto two issues in particular. Regarding the use of new \r\ntechnologies in the voting system of the General \r\nAssembly, my delegation notes with interest the \r\nrecommendations presented in the report and supports \r\ndeeper examination of the matter in order to achieve \r\ntangible results. We believe it is important for the \r\nAssembly to have the necessary means to process with \r\ngreater efficiency the counting of ballots in elections \r\nheld in this body. \r\n Likewise, we support the idea of creating a \r\nworking document that collects those provisions on \r\nrevitalization that are relevant to the daily work of the \r\nOrganization. Such a document could serve as an \r\nimportant guide for our work within the General \r\nAssembly and as a reminder of the need to fully \r\nimplement those resolutions that have been adopted. \r\n  Mr. Cujba (Republic of Moldova), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n \r\n Colombia continues to view with concern the \r\nimbalance that exists in the relationship among the \r\nmain bodies of the Organization and the appropriation \r\nof General Assembly topics by the Security Council. \r\nAccording to the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nAssembly should have a more active role in the \r\nconsideration of matters related to peace and security. \r\nSimilarly, the examination of topics such as human \r\nrights and humanitarian law are of the unique and \r\nexclusive competence of the General Assembly. \r\n The views expressed by Member States during \r\nthe debate on the report of the Security Council reflect \r\na certain frustration with the existing relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly and \r\nwith current communication between these bodies. As \r\nexpressed by my delegation last Tuesday, we recognize \r\nthe efforts carried out to improve communication \r\nbetween the Council and the rest of the membership. \r\nHowever, this improvement in communication should \r\nnot depend on the good will of whichever delegation \r\nhappens to hold the Council presidency but should be \r\ninstitutionalized in the working methods of the Council. \r\n Colombia views positively the extension of the \r\nmandate of the Ad Hoc Working Group in order to \r\ncontinue the consideration of the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We have made significant progress \r\nin identifying some of the areas on which we must \r\nfocus our efforts. It is of great importance to take \r\nadvantage of the progress achieved, so that during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly we can realize \r\ntangible results in terms of revitalization. \r\n Colombia firmly believes in the central role of \r\nthe General Assembly as the principal organ of our \r\nOrganization. My country reiterates its commitment to \r\ncontinue contributing to its revitalization and calls \r\nupon all Member State to show the necessary political \r\nwill to achieve our objective. As the President of the \r\nAssembly stated, the full implementation of all \r\nresolutions related to revitalization is a necessity. My \r\ndelegation will continue supporting all efforts aimed at \r\nreinvigorating the role of the Assembly, given the great \r\nchallenges facing our Organization. \r\n Mr. Bui The Giang (Viet Nam): First of all, on \r\nbehalf of the Vietnamese delegation, I would like to \r\nthank you for convening this meeting to discuss one of \r\nthe most important items on the General Assembly \r\nagenda. I would also like to thank Ambassador Eladio \r\nLoizaga of Paraguay and Ambassador Andrzej Towpik \r\nof Poland for their leadership in overseeing the Working \r\nGroup during the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly. My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by Ambassador Mourad Benmehidi of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Since 1991, when the item on General Assembly \r\nrevitalization was first officially recognized and \r\nsubsequently included in the agenda of the Assembly, \r\nuntiring efforts have been made and various measures \r\nhave been adopted by the General Assembly in many \r\nresolutions aimed at strengthening its authority and \r\nleadership so as to enable it to effectively play its role \r\nas the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations, in \r\naccordance with the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. In this connection, my delegation \r\nappreciates the work done over the past year by the \r\nWorking Group, as can be seen from its report in \r\ndocument A/62/952 and the factual chart on the \r\nimplementation of all relevant resolutions, both of \r\nwhich have been circulated to Member States. We \r\nbelieve these documents can serve as productive inputs \r\nfor thorough discussion and fair assessment of the \r\nstatus of the implementation of those resolutions, \r\nwhich is vital to further progress in revitalization. We \r\nreiterate Viet Nam’s commitment to work closely with \r\nother Member States for full implementation of \r\nresolution 62/276 of 15 September 2008 on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.  \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n15 08-61155 \r\n \r\n Bearing in mind the ongoing nature of the \r\nprocess, we would like to emphasize the following \r\npoints. First, as a critical component of the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations, \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nshould continue to aim at strengthening the central role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly in the entire \r\nUnited Nations system. In view of the increasingly \r\ncomplicated developments in many parts of today’s \r\nworld, special meetings held by the General Assembly \r\ninvolving high-level participation — such as those held \r\nsince the opening of the sixty-third session on the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nAfrica’s development needs, the midterm review of the \r\nimplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action \r\nand, most recently, the dialogue on interreligious and \r\nintercultural understanding and cooperation for \r\npeace — deserve commendation and need to be further \r\npromoted. If properly organized and conducted, such \r\nmeetings can produce across-the-board assessment, \r\nobjective analysis and visionary recommendations and \r\ncan help pull together the resources badly needed for \r\ntheir implementation. In the same vein, we support \r\nfurther General Assembly discussions on current global \r\nissues in the fields of peace, security, development, \r\nhumanitarian affairs and human rights and, in \r\nparticular, on the “three-Fs crisis” — financial, food \r\nand fuel — which would take into account fully the \r\ninterests and concerns of the membership and of \r\ndeveloping countries in particular. \r\n Secondly, my delegation shares the view expressed \r\nby many speakers that, in order to achieve tangible \r\nresults, it is essential to implement those resolutions \r\nrelated to the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nthat have been adopted to date. To that end, we believe \r\nthat the status of implementation should be evaluated, \r\nthe reasons determining that status analysed, both \r\nquantitatively and qualitatively, and lessons drawn in \r\norder to ensure the practicality and usefulness of \r\nrecommendations made. \r\n Thirdly, improving cooperation and coordination \r\namong the General Assembly and other principal \r\norgans of the United Nations, other international \r\ninstitutions and civil society, as well as among the \r\nMain Committees and subsidiary bodies of the General \r\nAssembly, remains urgent for ensuring the success of \r\nUnited Nations reform in general and of the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly in \r\nparticular. With that in mind, while we welcome the \r\nregular briefings by the Secretary-General to the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the periodic meetings between \r\nthe General Assembly President and the Presidents of \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, my delegation would like to see these \r\npractices improved in quality and made more \r\ninteractive in nature with a view to ensuring their \r\nsubstantiality and effectiveness, thus contributing to \r\nthe better performance of the Organization. \r\n We share the view of the President of the General \r\nAssembly regarding the intertwined challenges and \r\nopportunities the world is facing today. In this context, \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly is \r\nall the more important and imperative than ever before, \r\nfor, in turn, this process will help enhance United \r\nNations reform so as to fulfil the Organization’s role in \r\nleading the international community to successfully \r\naddress the challenges and make full use of the \r\nopportunities at hand. In this undertaking, my \r\ndelegation assures the Assembly, the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup, which we hope will be set up in due time, and \r\nits Chairs, of our full support and cooperation. \r\n Mrs. Vargas Walter (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. In that regard I would like to add some \r\ncomments on this important item. Firstly, my \r\ndelegation would like to thank the co-Chairs of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the presentation of the report \r\nand also for the efforts in the preparation of the \r\ninventory/chart of all relevant resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We consider \r\nthe chart a useful tool for assessing the status of the \r\nimplementation of those resolutions. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is a \r\ndecisive element in a genuine reform of the United \r\nNations. We cannot hope for an Organization that takes \r\ndemocratic and effective action if the General \r\nAssembly does not fully exercise the power bestowed \r\nupon it by the Charter. The revitalization should \r\nreaffirm the central role of the General Assembly as the \r\nchief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations, as is well recognized by \r\nthe Charter and the Millennium Declaration. \r\n It is important that, when that process concludes, \r\nthe Assembly strengthens its independence as an organ \r\nfor comprehensive debate, where the freedom of its \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 16 \r\n \r\nMember States to address issues of interest to them is \r\nnot restricted or limited. \r\n We underscore the need to achieve an adequate \r\nbalance among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations in accordance with the Charter. It is also \r\nimportant that Member States of the Organization put \r\nan end to any attempt to transfer General Assembly \r\nagenda items to the purview of the Security Council. \r\nThe Security Council must strictly abide by the \r\nprovisions of the Charter, as well as all resolutions of \r\nthe General Assembly, which is the principal organ of \r\nthe Organization, and it must stop meddling in \r\nquestions that are clearly within the functions and \r\npowers of other United Nations principal organs and \r\ntheir subsidiary bodies. \r\n My delegation would like to state its concern at \r\nthe establishment of rules and definitions by the \r\nSecurity Council that exceed its competence, \r\ndisregarding the fact that, in accordance with Article \r\n13 of the Charter, the General Assembly has the \r\nprimary responsibility for the progressive development \r\nof international law and its codification. \r\n My delegation believes that, in order to avoid \r\nirregularities that set precedents within the United \r\nNations system, the Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecurity Council must hold regular discussions and \r\ncoordinate among themselves with regard to the \r\nagendas and workplans of their respective principal \r\norgans, so as to establish increased coherence and \r\ncomplementariness among them, in a manner mutually \r\nreinforcing and respectful of the mandates of each one \r\nof them while avoiding duplication of work and \r\nencroachment on their respective assigned roles. \r\n Cuba reiterates the fact that that the revitalization \r\nof the Assembly must not be a merely bureaucratic \r\nprocess. All States must implement General Assembly \r\nresolutions, and multilateralism must not be used by a \r\nfew powerful countries only to serve their own \r\ninterests. At the same time, we further hope that, as a \r\nresult of such process, the interaction between the \r\nSecretariat and the General Assembly will be \r\nstrengthened, so that the former can respond in a more \r\neffective manner to mandates set by Member States. \r\n My delegation would like to conclude its \r\nstatement by reiterating that the Assembly may count \r\non the Cuban delegation’s full willingness to continue \r\nits constructive participation in the work in progress on \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in French): First, \r\nI wish to congratulate the President of the Assembly on \r\nhis manner of conducting this debate, which is of \r\nspecial importance to Member States. I also wish to \r\ncongratulate the Ambassadors of Poland and Paraguay \r\nfor their considerable efforts during the sixty-second \r\nsession of the Assembly as facilitators for the agenda \r\nitem on the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Once again this year, the Assembly continues to \r\ndebate the item on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. It must be recalled that this is a \r\nprocess that requires the commitment of all Member \r\nStates, whatever their various approaches may be. To \r\nthat end, the heads of State and Government \r\nreaffirmed, at the World Summit of September 2005, \r\nthe central role played by the General Assembly as the \r\nprincipal deliberative organ of the United Nations \r\nresponsible for setting policy in the Organization. We \r\nassociate ourselves with the statement made on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement on the agenda item for \r\ntoday’s plenary meeting. Nonetheless, I wish, here, to \r\nmake the following comments. \r\n My delegation believes that strengthening the \r\nrole and the authority of the General Assembly \r\nrequires, inter alia, the inclusion on its agenda of \r\nclearly topical issues that are of crucial importance \r\nboth for the Organization and for the international \r\ncommunity. It also requires planning of major thematic \r\ndebates, so that Member States can agree on the \r\nprincipal substantive and topical questions. \r\n Accordingly, we welcome the high quality of the \r\nthematic debates organized at previous sessions, a \r\npractice certain to continue under the current \r\npresidency. At the same time, we believe that the \r\nstructure of those debates would gain by being \r\nmodified in order to establish an interactive dialogue \r\namong Member States. The results of the debates \r\nshould be taken into account when elaborating joint \r\naction in the United Nations. \r\n Likewise, my delegation believes that \r\nstrengthening the role and the authority of the General \r\nAssembly also requires recognition of its role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Indeed, \r\nwhile it is commonly acknowledged that Article 24 of \r\nthe Charter confers the primary responsibility in that \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n17 08-61155 \r\n \r\narea on the Security Council, that responsibility is not \r\nexclusive. The General Assembly should therefore take \r\nup more questions of international peace and security \r\nin conformity with the relevant Articles of the Charter. \r\n The question of the reports that the Security \r\nCouncil is required to submit to plenary in keeping \r\nwith the relevant Articles of the Charter should also \r\ncontinue to be discussed. Despite repeated appeals of \r\nMember States, the Security Council continues to \r\nsubmit annual reports that are factual in nature. The \r\nCouncil also should be able to submit analytical reports \r\nto the General Assembly, including ones on specific \r\nsubjects. \r\n Among other subjects, the question of the \r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nother principal organs of the United Nations should \r\nalso be discussed in depth. That discussion should be \r\ncontinued here, in the plenary, and also within the \r\ncontext of an approach based on cooperation and \r\nmaintaining the balance and respecting the roles that \r\nthe Charter confers on each of the organs. \r\n I wish to make the following comments on the \r\nmethods of work of the General Assembly. My \r\nGovernment is pleased to note that several steps to \r\nimprove the working methods of the General Assembly \r\nhave been implemented, in particular the use in recent \r\nyears within the Main Committees of interactive \r\ndebates, round tables and question and answer sessions. \r\nThose practices have enriched our deliberations and the \r\ndecision-making process in the Main Committees. \r\nHowever, those efforts have fallen short of the \r\nexpectations of Member States. \r\n On another subject, we believe that several of the \r\nmeasures that have been proposed during debates on \r\nimproving the working methods of the Assembly but \r\nhave not yet been the subject of decisions should be \r\nre-examined. That, inter alia, applies to the proposal on \r\nthe organization of the work of the Main Committees \r\nof the General Assembly into two substantive periods \r\nper session, and to harmonize the best working \r\npractices of the Main Committees, which, must I recall, \r\ndo vary. \r\n Finally, I would like lend my delegation’s support \r\nto the mandate set by the Assembly in September, \r\nwhen, in resolution 62/276, it decided to establish, at \r\nits sixty-third session, an ad hoc working group on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly to identify ways \r\nto enhance the role, authority and effectiveness of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, inter alia, by building on relevant \r\nresolutions, and to submit a report thereon.  \r\n In this context, we believe that the revitalization \r\nof the work of the General Assembly is an ongoing \r\nprocess and that it needs to be pursued with \r\ndetermination.  \r\n Ms. Alzhanova (Kazakhstan): At the 2005 World \r\nSummit, Member States reaffirmed their commitment \r\nto strengthening the United Nations with a view to \r\nenhancing its authority and efficiency, as well as its \r\ncapacity to address effectively the full range of global \r\nchallenges. \r\n The United Nations General Assembly, which \r\nenjoys universal membership, is a unique \r\nintergovernmental body dealing with all critical issues \r\naround the globe. Strengthening this main organ \r\nrequires political will and commitment on the part of \r\nall Member States. For almost twenty years, repetitive \r\nAssembly resolutions have focused on the need for \r\nfurther work on revitalizing the role and authority of \r\nthe Assembly and strengthening its performance so it \r\nfully exercises the power that the United Nations \r\nCharter accords it. The final objective of this process is \r\nthe General Assembly as the main deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Revitalization of the General Assembly is a core \r\nelement of the whole United Nations reform process \r\nand is closely linked to the reform of other United \r\nNations main bodies and their working methods. Yet, \r\nwhile the division of labour between three principle \r\norgans of the United Nations is reflected in the Charter, \r\nthere is still debate on the issue of the disparity of \r\npower, which most likely derives from different \r\ninterpretations of respective Charter provisions. While \r\nthe cost of the lengthy debating process in the \r\nAssembly has been too high, the cost of overcoming \r\nthe gap caused by misinterpretation is not. It requires \r\njust a strong political will in the part of Member States. \r\n Kazakhstan notes certain progress in efforts to \r\nimprove the efficiency of the General Assembly and its \r\nmethods of work. In this regard, my delegation would \r\nlike to commend the co-Chairs, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Paraguay and Poland, for their \r\npractical approach, which offers a detailed analysis of \r\nthe status of implementation of existing resolutions and \r\ndecisions on revitalization in the inventory chart. The \r\nchart is a very handy instrument for assessment that \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 18 \r\n \r\nconsolidates main and relevant provisions of relevant \r\nresolutions, distributed among three main clusters. We \r\ncommend the recommendation that the next report of \r\nthe Secretary-General on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly use the chart devised by the \r\nco-Chairs as a model. \r\n Browsing through the chart, one notices that most \r\nof the resolutions are either implemented or have \r\nongoing status. For some, Member States are indicated \r\nas the implementing entity. Thus, together we all have \r\nto find the root causes of our poor performance and \r\noffer a constructive strategy for delivering the results. \r\n It will not be possible to implement all the \r\nrecommendations on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly without a competent and professional United \r\nNations Secretariat. The Secretariat should be staffed \r\nwith people who are the most suitable to perform the \r\ntasks at hand. In this regard, it is very important to \r\nensure that the measures to strengthen the Secretariat \r\nachieve their main goal — to improve its efficiency. \r\n As a positive shift, we would like to point out \r\nthat the President of the General Assembly now meets \r\nperiodically with the Presidents of the Security Council \r\nand the Economic and Social Council with a view to \r\nensuring increased cooperation, coordination and \r\ncomplementarity of the work programmes of those \r\nthree principal organs. \r\n Moreover, in recent years, the Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly have been proactive in addressing \r\nthe most pressing global issues through thematic \r\ndebates and informal plenary meetings. We expect that \r\nduring the current session, the President will lead \r\nMember States towards the commencement of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, which is one of the most acute issues of the \r\nentire organizational reform process. \r\n Other measures that have been implemented \r\ninclude the utilization by the Main Committees of the \r\npractice of interactive debates, panel discussions and \r\nquestion-and-answer sessions in order to enhance \r\ninformal, in-depth discussions and to bring together \r\nexperts from various fields. Those practices, inter alia, \r\nhave enabled a dynamic and candid exchange with \r\nheads of departments and offices, representatives of the \r\nSecretary-General and special rapporteurs, thereby \r\nadding to deliberations and decision-making processes \r\nin the Main Committees. Yet we believe that this \r\nprocess should not replace the reforms that are aimed, \r\nfirst and foremost, at strengthening the authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress its expectation that progress should be \r\nachieved on the revitalization process of the main \r\nUnited Nations body during its sixty-third session. \r\n Mr. Afifi (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly is discussing today one of the most \r\nimportant items on its agenda. This item acquires its \r\nimportance from the nature of the role and authority of \r\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations as the \r\nchief deliberative and policymaking body and the most \r\ndemocratic organ of the Organization. It has these \r\nqualities not only because it comprises all Member \r\nStates, but also because of its responsibility for \r\nsupervising the balance of competence of the main and \r\nsubsidiary organs, as well as for observing the \r\nimplementation of their mandates and taking the \r\nnecessary measures to fulfil them, if deemed necessary, \r\nas would be the case if one of those organs was to \r\nexceed its mandate and infringe on the responsibilities \r\nof another organ or not fulfil the purposes and \r\nprinciples set out in the United Nations Charter. \r\n We would like to express our deep appreciation \r\nfor the role of the Permanent Representatives of \r\nParaguay and Poland during the past session and their \r\nefforts to coordinate our discussions on this important \r\nissue, which were crowned with a report that, as all \r\nprevious speakers have mentioned, shows quality and \r\nefficiency (A/62/952). We would like to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to move towards implementing the \r\nrecommendations contained therein. \r\n Egypt would like to associate itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\nHowever, I would like to underscore a number of \r\nadditional important points. \r\n First, revitalization of the role of the General \r\nAssembly is an ongoing process based on the effective \r\nimplementation of Assembly resolutions on this issue \r\nas well as on negotiations on additional steps aimed at \r\nconsolidating what has been achieved, on the one hand, \r\nand at adding additional measures to revitalize the \r\nAssembly, on the other. This will be in accordance with \r\nagreements reached on this issue during the sixty-\r\nsecond session. However, these efforts will not succeed \r\nif we limit ourselves only to discussing ways to \r\nstreamline the Assembly’s programme of work and the \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n19 08-61155 \r\n \r\nmandates of its Main Committees, or if we only seek to \r\nreduce the number of meetings or the reports submitted \r\nto it. A clear and objective plan is required, one based \r\non an integrated strategy to enhance the Assembly’s \r\ncapacity to uphold its responsibilities and to respond \r\neffectively to international developments as well as to \r\nthe needs of the peoples of the world. \r\n Secondly, we elected the eighth Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization, by his appointment by the \r\nGeneral Assembly by consensus upon recommendation \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n The discussions that accompanied that process \r\nhave highlighted the need to continue searching for \r\nways to solidify the role of the General Assembly in \r\nthe process of selecting a Secretary-General, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of the Charter and in \r\nline with General Assembly resolutions 51/241 and \r\n60/286. This must be accomplished by establishing a \r\nclear mechanism that would allow the General \r\nAssembly to evaluate the candidates, as well as present \r\ntheir names to the Security Council for examination.  \r\n In addition, tighter control is required over the \r\nstandards that the Security Council uses in offering its \r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly, especially \r\nby banning the use of the veto in selecting the \r\nSecretary-General in order to ensure equity and \r\nequality among the members of the Council on the one \r\nhand, as well as to establish a balance between the \r\nSecurity Council’s authority in making such \r\nrecommendations and the General Assembly’s authority \r\nin appointing the recommended candidate on the other. \r\n We must put an end to the Security Council’s \r\nattempts, increasing day by day, to infringe upon the \r\nauthority of the General Assembly. We must reaffirm \r\nthe need to respect the separation of authority and \r\nfunctions among the main organs, as stipulated by the \r\nCharter; and we must tie that to the General \r\nAssembly’s authority and specialization in supervising \r\nthe way the Security Council undertakes its main \r\nresponsibilities, which requires finding a remedy to the \r\nimbalance in the institutional relationship between the \r\ntwo organs. We must not view this issue as an attempt \r\nto undermine the competence of the Security Council \r\nin favour of the General Assembly, for each of these \r\ntwo organs has its own responsibilities that determine \r\nthe purpose of their existence. Moreover, members of \r\nthe Security Council are also members of the General \r\nAssembly, which means that activating each of the two \r\nmain organs’ roles and maintaining a balance between \r\nthem is of common purpose and in the common interest \r\nof all Members of the Organization.  \r\n The need to revitalize the General Assembly also \r\napplies to its main role in issues pertaining to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in \r\naccordance with Articles 10, 11, 12, 14 and 35 of the \r\nCharter. This role should not be limited purely to \r\nfunding United Nations peacekeeping operations in \r\nareas of war and conflict, but it also should be \r\nembodied in the General Assembly’s playing a real and \r\ntangible role in preventing conflict as well as in \r\ncontributing to the process for settling conflicts.  \r\n It is also tied to the need to activate the General \r\nAssembly’s treatment of cases where the Security \r\nCouncil is unable to undertake the responsibilities \r\nconferred on it by United Nations Member States for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, as \r\na result of the use, misuse or the threat of use of the \r\nveto, in a manner that would reflect the Security \r\nCouncil’s inability to understand the nature and \r\ndimensions of a number of important issues that \r\nthreaten international stability. This could have a \r\nnegative impact on the chances of reaching settlements \r\non those issues and could prolong conflict, as well as \r\nincrease human suffering. \r\n In the same context, it is important, while \r\nimplementing the reform plan, to activate the roles of \r\nthe General Assembly and its relevant committees in \r\norder to implement the concept of “one vote for every \r\nState” and not place obstacles in the way of \r\nimplementing issues mandated by the General \r\nAssembly. Also, we must not seek to dismiss the role \r\nof the General Assembly’s supervisory functions — \r\nthrough the use of financial contributions, which are \r\nevaluated on the basis of the ability to pay — as a \r\nmeans to pressure the Secretariat and the Organization \r\nand affect its neutrality. Here, we must indicate the \r\nneed to achieve a balance and rebuild confidence \r\nbetween developing and developed countries and the \r\nSecretariat on a more equitable basis, so the General \r\nAssembly can assume its responsibilities without any \r\noutside influences or pressures. \r\n The General Assembly President’s address at the \r\nopening meeting of the sixty-third session called for \r\ndemocratizing the United Nations based on several \r\nimportant considerations. It reaffirmed the call issued \r\nby world leaders in the 2005 World Summit Outcome, \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 20 \r\n \r\nwhich stressed the need to commit to the principles and \r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter during the \r\nreform of the Organization. They also affirmed that the \r\ncredibility of the Organization and its enhanced \r\ncapacity to undertake its responsibilities are now more \r\nrelevant to the ability of the General Assembly to \r\nexercise its institutional authority, as well as to \r\nentrench the balance between it and other organs. \r\n We look forward to participating effectively in \r\nthe high-level dialogue that the General Assembly \r\nPresident intends to hold on this issue, and we hope \r\nthat it will witness a real effort to reach international \r\nagreement on several steps that aim to bolster the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s ability to undertake its \r\nresponsibilities, even though the differences over this \r\nissue remain and are increasingly tense as a result of \r\nthe desire of some to monopolize certain main and \r\nsubsidiary organs by assuming these responsibilities \r\nwithout supervision in blatant contradiction to the \r\npurposes and principles of the Organization. \r\n Mrs. Asmady (Indonesia): We thank the \r\nPresident for convening this debate on the orientation \r\nof the body that best represents the aspirations of the \r\nglobal community. Let me reiterate our support for his \r\nefforts to enhance democracy within the larger United \r\nNations Organization. We also express our gratitude to \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Paraguay and Poland \r\nfor their work as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nand thank them for their report on the subject. \r\n To address the international imbalance in the \r\nsocio-economic fields and to help promote peace, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, with the broadest membership of \r\nnations, should actively play its due role, in accordance \r\nwith to the Charter. Indonesia will continue to play its \r\npart in the formulation of measures to strengthen this \r\nbody. \r\n Indonesia associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n To energize the General Assembly, we must all \r\naim to strengthen its role as the principal deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations. In this regard, we need to continue to evaluate \r\nthe status of the implementation of relevant \r\nresolutions. Additionally, we should identify new ways \r\nto enhance the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the Assembly, including by building on \r\nprevious Assembly resolutions.  \r\n The implementation of the relevant decisions and \r\nresolutions on revitalizing the General Assembly cannot \r\nbe emphasized strongly enough. The international \r\ncommunity reposes its trust in this esteemed organ and \r\nwants it to set norms and to act in a timely manner \r\nwhen addressing the world’s ills. Greater and better \r\nresults that positively impact people everywhere \r\nrequire all Assembly Members to implement their own \r\ncalls and commitments, as contained in the documents \r\nadopted at this forum. \r\n We support some form of mechanism at the \r\nSecretariat level to track the implementation of \r\nresolutions and keep the members of the General \r\nAssembly informed on the progress of implementation. \r\n It is crucial for the General Assembly to continue \r\nto work actively in the areas of global development, \r\npeace and security. It must show leadership in policy \r\ndebates and in developing norms for effectively \r\ndealing with existing and emerging challenges of \r\ncollective concern, such as food, energy, climate \r\nchange and the financial crisis. \r\n My delegation appreciates the General Assembly \r\nPresident’s convening of recent discussions on the \r\nglobal financial crisis. We hope that these will be \r\nfollowed up effectively, with special consideration for \r\npolicy proposals aimed at countering the contagion of \r\nthe crisis among developing regions. \r\n To properly deal with the complicated and \r\nmultifaceted international challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, it is vital that relations among all \r\nprincipal United Nations organs are balanced and that \r\nthere is cooperation and collaboration on the pertinent \r\nissues. It goes without saying that all United Nations \r\nentities must perform their roles in accordance with \r\ntheir respective mandates. But they should seek ways \r\nto create synergies for targeted purposes, in the spirit \r\nof the global partnership for development and peace. \r\n In this context, it is essential that the Assembly \r\nalso reflects on how the ongoing deliberations on \r\nSecurity Council reform, United Nations system-wide \r\ncoherence and the mandate review can contribute to \r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly. \r\n The Assembly has an important role to also \r\nencourage and support the United Nations peace \r\nfacilitation architecture and further efforts in \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n21 08-61155 \r\n \r\npeacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, at both \r\nHeadquarters and field levels. The relatively nascent \r\nUnited Nations institutions, such as the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, require strong support from the \r\nAssembly, as well as the entire United Nations system. \r\n Without prejudice to the United Nations Charter \r\nArticle 12 and in line with Article 11, paragraph 2, as \r\nwell as General Assembly resolution 377 (V), the \r\n“Uniting for Peace” resolution, the Assembly should \r\nplay its due role in facilitating the promotion of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Moving forward, we believe that the General \r\nAssembly’s resolutions should be more streamlined \r\nand action-oriented. We also need to plan and organize \r\nour work in the different committees efficiently, with \r\nfocused debates and outcomes. Furthermore, it is \r\nimportant that repetition and overlap of mandates are \r\navoided. But we must ensure that the rationalization of \r\nwork is not carried out at the expense of substantive \r\nmatters. \r\n Mr. Sumi (Japan): I would like to express my \r\nsincere gratitude to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening today’s meeting to discuss one \r\nof the most important items on the General Assembly \r\nagenda, namely, the revitalization of its work. Since \r\nthe General Assembly is represented by all the Member \r\nStates of the United Nations and is mandated to deal \r\nwith all questions or matters within the scope of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, revitalizing its work is the core \r\nof the United Nations reform process. \r\n We are in the middle of useful, major thematic \r\ndebates and panel discussions, and Japan appreciates \r\nthis initiative. I am convinced that the outcome of the \r\nHigh-level event on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals held on 25 September would not have been so \r\nsuccessful without the substantive contribution made \r\nby the General Assembly’s thematic debate held last \r\nApril entitled “Recognizing the achievements, \r\naddressing the challenges and getting back on track to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015”. \r\nI also believe that the thematic debate on human \r\nsecurity held in May was extremely fruitful, since it \r\ncould promote understanding by the United Nations \r\nMember States of this very important concept relating \r\nto all the major activities conducted by the \r\nOrganization, such as development, international peace \r\nand security and human rights. I strongly expect that \r\nthe thematic debate on that occasion will enable the \r\nconcept of human security to be incorporated further \r\ninto the work of the Organization. \r\n Another thematic debate held in April, entitled \r\n“Toward a Common Understanding on Management \r\nReform”, although a contribution to recognition of the \r\ncurrent agenda by Member States, did, however, \r\nduplicate certain discussions already held in the Fifth \r\nCommittee. In this regard, I would like to point out \r\nthat, considering the limited resources of the United \r\nNations, holding thematic debates requires a careful \r\nselection of themes and content on a case-by-case \r\nbasis. \r\n Secondly, the General Assembly must continue to \r\ndeploy its utmost efforts in improving its work, \r\ndiscussions and decisions in order to make them more \r\neffective. It is more important than ever to further \r\nfocus the work of the General Assembly on priority \r\nissues and to relay action-oriented messages by \r\nstreamlining its agenda, reducing the volume of \r\nsubmitted documents and tackling its activities with \r\nimproved effectiveness. In this context, I would \r\nparticularly like to request the Secretariat to share, in \r\nadvance and with transparency, full information \r\nregarding the agenda items directly covered by the \r\nplenary of the General Assembly, such as the schedule \r\nof discussions or actions on resolutions, with all the \r\nMember States through, for example, the Journal. \r\n Japan also commends the regular meetings \r\nbetween the President of the Security Council and the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, as well as the \r\npractice whereby the Secretary-General provides the \r\nGeneral Assembly with timely briefings and reports on \r\nvarious fields. We expect cooperation and coordination \r\namong the principal organs of the United Nations to be \r\nstrengthened, improved and encouraged as the \r\nrevitalization process continues.  \r\n Furthermore, Japan welcomes the close \r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, as the General Assembly is \r\nthe organ that provides overall guidance to the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, and we appreciate the \r\nactive discussions on that Commission’s annual report \r\nto the General Assembly. \r\n Finally, my delegation would like to stress the \r\nimportance of the implementation of what has already \r\nbeen agreed upon. Meaningful revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is possible through timely and fair \r\nimplementation of the decisions and measures adopted. \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 22 \r\n \r\nIn this regard, I appreciate every effort made by the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group and the Secretariat. However, \r\nthose efforts must be continued, and I believe that the \r\nad hoc working group to be established at the sixty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly under resolution \r\n62/276 should again focus on reviewing and \r\nmonitoring the status of implementation of relevant \r\nresolutions. \r\n In anticipation of forthcoming constructive \r\ndiscussion on this agenda item, my delegation \r\nreiterates its commitment to contributing to revitalizing \r\nthe work of the General Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Yaroshevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe question of the revitalization of the work of the \r\nUnited Nations General Assembly is a priority matter \r\nfor Belarus. This item is a topical one for the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) as well, and Belarus \r\nfully supports the NAM statement. \r\n The outcome of the negotiating process to \r\nrevitalize the work of the General Assembly at the \r\nprevious session was the adoption of resolution 62/276. \r\nThat resolution set the format for work on this issue at \r\nthe sixty-third General Assembly session. It also \r\nendorsed the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the General Assembly, as well as \r\nthe table that reflects the status of implementation of \r\npreviously adopted resolutions. \r\n This far-reaching result was achieved, inter alia, \r\nthanks to the efforts of the two co-Chairs of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly — namely, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Paraguay, Ambassador Eladio \r\nLoizaga, and the Permanent Representative of Poland, \r\nAmbassador Andrzej Towpik. We congratulate them on \r\ntheir creative and innovative approach. Their careful \r\nhandling of delegations’ proposals produced concrete \r\npractical results. The positive experience of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group acquired at the previous session should \r\nalso be used in other negotiating processes that are \r\ntaking place in the General Assembly. \r\n Work to revitalize the activities of the General \r\nAssembly is not an end in itself. It should not be \r\nconducted as a mere nod to that annual tradition of \r\ndoing something in that area. The main purpose of that \r\nwork should be to create the conditions needed to \r\nenhance the effectiveness of the General Assembly and \r\nto align its mandate with current demands and the \r\ninternational situation. \r\n The work done in recent years in the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group is beginning to produce some initial \r\nresults. Thematic debates are now regularly held on \r\nurgent international questions. The President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has the organizational capacity to \r\nform a strong team of professionals in his office. The \r\nleading media have reacted to the work of the General \r\nAssembly and the media are paying more attention now \r\nto events that are taking place in this very Hall.  \r\n However, much still remains to be done. For \r\nexample, we propose that we work out a mechanism \r\nfor the Secretariat to record the most interesting and \r\nconstructive views and proposals made during the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s thematic debates. That recording \r\nof ideas should be followed by their analysis. \r\nFollowing that analysis, it would be a good idea to \r\nprepare recommendations on the possibility of \r\nimplementing a delegation’s proposals. Valuable ideas \r\nshould not lie fallow, but should be seized and put into \r\npractice. Perhaps, Member States should take the \r\nappropriate decision to create such a mechanism to \r\nrecord such ideas.  \r\n There is a need to enhance the role of the General \r\nAssembly in resolving issues of international peace and \r\nsecurity, particularly through expanding the possibility \r\nfor States Members of the United Nations to convene \r\nspecial extraordinary sessions of the General Assembly. \r\n The Belarus delegation believes that the model \r\nand the contents of the table that was drawn up at the \r\nsixty-second session on the status of implementation of \r\nthe provisions of previously adopted resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nshould serve as a point of departure for work on that \r\nissue at this current session of the General Assembly. \r\nNow, we can see better what the Secretariat and \r\nMember States need to work on jointly to ensure that \r\nthe role of the General Assembly is in keeping with the \r\nlofty status of the United Nations accorded by its \r\nCharter. The table clearly shows those areas and \r\ndecisions where progress has been absent or \r\ninsignificant. It could serve as a guide for action for the \r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and Member States.  \r\n Even today, we must draw attention to the \r\ninadmissibility of significant, unjustified delay in the \r\npreparation of reports for Member States, and, in a \r\nnumber of cases, the reports were prepared, but were \r\nnot sufficiently specific.  \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n23 08-61155 \r\n \r\n We also believe that it is high time to start \r\nthinking about finding ways to really involve the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the process of selecting \r\ncandidacies for the post of Head of the United Nations \r\nSecretariat. The fact that no provisions under the \r\ncategory Election of the Secretary-General have been \r\nfulfilled causes profound concern and requires due \r\naction to be taken. On the one hand, the interests of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in electing the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations are a stumbling block in the \r\nSecurity Council-General Assembly context. On the \r\nother hand, however, satisfying those interests would \r\nbe a real opportunity to improve the atmosphere of \r\ntrust among the principal organs of the United Nations \r\nand to establish a genuinely equal cooperation among \r\nthem on that matter. \r\n The Belarus delegation intends to continue to \r\nmake a constructive contribution to the negotiating \r\nprocess on revitalizing the work of the General \r\nAssembly of the United Nations and is prepared to \r\npropose ideas to enhance that work within the Working \r\nGroup. \r\n Ms. Yusof (Malaysia): It is a pleasure for \r\nMalaysia to participate in this debate on agenda item \r\n110 on the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly. It is even more of an honour for my \r\ndelegation to participate in this year’s debate under the \r\nstewardship of a General Assembly President who has \r\nmade democratization of the United Nations a \r\ncornerstone of his presidency. We hope that in his \r\nefforts to democratize the United Nations, he will be \r\nable to imbue the General Assembly with renewed \r\nvigour and a sense of ownership in the issues being \r\ndiscussed. \r\n Allow me to take this opportunity to align my \r\ndelegation with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM). \r\n The issue of the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has been a subject of plenary debate \r\nsince 1991. However, only two short years ago, in \r\nadopting resolution 61/292, the General Assembly \r\nestablished the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly to address that \r\nissue. We are pleased to see that the Working Group \r\nhas been hard at work in discharging its mandate this \r\npast year. \r\n In that regard, the work of the co-Chairs of the \r\nWorking Group, Ambassador Loizaga of Paraguay and \r\nAmbassador Towpik of Poland, must be given due \r\nrecognition. By May 2008, the co-Chairs were able to \r\ncirculate a matrix of all the relevant provisions on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Malaysia \r\nwelcomes that step forward by the co-Chairs. That is \r\nthe crystallization of what Malaysia and other NAM \r\nmembers have requested since the fifty-ninth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. With the publication of the \r\nmatrix, it became much easier to identify which \r\nrelevant provisions have been implemented and which \r\nstill remain to be so. \r\n The matrix itself, however, is merely a procedural \r\naspect to the ongoing deliberations in the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly. Substantively, the General \r\nAssembly must reclaim its central role, including in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security, as laid down in \r\nArticle 11 of the United Nations Charter. Relations \r\nbetween the other organs of the United Nations and the \r\nGeneral Assembly must be strengthened, and the \r\ncontents of meetings that take place between the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council should \r\nbe disseminated to the wider United Nations \r\nmembership. As the chief deliberative organ of the \r\nUnited Nations with universal membership, the \r\nGeneral Assembly and Member States must be kept in \r\nthe loop. \r\n One of the matters that has always been a subject \r\nin the debate on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly is the issuance of documentation, or more \r\nspecifically the late issuance of reports by the \r\nSecretariat. After going over this matter again and \r\nagain, it is perhaps ironic that the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on the revitalization of the General Assembly, \r\ncontained in document A/62/608, was also issued late. \r\nThe report was only made available to Member States \r\non 10 January 2008. Malaysia agrees that the late \r\nissuance of any report should be accompanied by an \r\nexplanation, citing specific reasons for the delay. That \r\nwould help assist Member States in understanding the \r\nproblem. \r\n Malaysia has always welcomed the holding of \r\nthematic debates in the General Assembly. However, \r\nwe believe that the decision to hold those thematic \r\ndebates must be done in concurrence with the general \r\nmembership of the Assembly. That would allow \r\nMember States the opportunity to prioritize the \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 24 \r\n \r\nthematic debates to be held throughout the year. We \r\nunderstand that all subjects should be equally \r\nimportant, but also that there exist certain priorities \r\nwhen resources are finite. \r\n Thematic debates and high-level segments must \r\nalso be action-oriented in order to ensure that optimum \r\nbenefit is derived from the holding of those debates \r\nand segments. A lot of effort, publicity and resources \r\ngo into the holding of those thematic debates and high-\r\nlevel segments. It is only fitting, therefore, that those \r\ndebates end with some form of outcome or proposal. \r\n Thematic debates, panel discussions and high-\r\nlevel segments are the General Assembly’s way of \r\nensuring that it maintains its finger on the pulse of \r\ntoday’s fast-paced world. Malaysia welcomes the \r\nrecent initiative of holding an interactive panel \r\ndiscussion on the global financial crisis. The timing \r\ncould never have been better. \r\n In conclusion, Malaysia looks forward to working \r\nconstructively within the Working Group on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly at this sixty-\r\nthird session. Malaysia believes that there is great \r\npotential in this Working Group and is confident that \r\nthe Group’s discussions will further contribute to the \r\nprocess of the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nas a whole. \r\n Mr. Bhandari (Nepal): At the outset, the \r\ndelegation of Nepal would like to thank the co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly for their diligent work on the \r\npreparation of the report (A/62/952). My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n Under the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nGeneral Assembly is the main deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations. It is the highest organ embracing the \r\nacclaimed values of universal democratic representation \r\nand the sovereign equality of nations. \r\n The President of the General Assembly has rightly \r\nhighlighted the importance of the democratization of \r\nthe United Nations. That should start with the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly so as to allow it \r\nto play its role as the principal organ of the United \r\nNations. \r\n First, we need to strengthen the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and its coordination \r\nwith the heads of the other organs, the Main \r\nCommittee Bureaux and the Secretariat.  \r\n Secondly, we need to protect the jurisdiction of \r\nthe legislative authority of the General Assembly by \r\nallowing it to proactively adopt legislation, putting an \r\nend to the current practice whereby the Security \r\nCouncil adopts resolutions of a legislative nature. \r\n Thirdly, the deliberative authority of the General \r\nAssembly should be strengthened, bringing in more \r\nfrequent discussions on issues of pressing concern to \r\nthe membership. The General Assembly should play a \r\nmore proactive role in finding solutions to the world’s \r\nemerging crises, such as climate change, the food crisis \r\nand the global financial crisis. The General Assembly \r\nshould also focus its efforts on the challenges of \r\ndevelopment, such as in the implementation of \r\ninternationally agreed goals, especially in the least \r\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries, \r\nsmall States and countries emerging from conflict. \r\nWith regard to all those issues, the General Assembly \r\nshould aim to produce result-oriented outcomes, rather \r\nthan serving as a mere deliberative talk shop. \r\n Fourthly, we should be making more efficient use \r\nof the budget-making authority of the General \r\nAssembly as a step towards revitalizing that body. We \r\nneed to strengthen the budgetary authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, especially its Fifth Committee, over \r\nthe functions and activities of all the organs of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n We welcome the practice of informal briefings by \r\nthe Secretary-General to the General Assembly, which \r\nenhances transparency and accountability within the \r\nUnited Nations system. It would be more useful to \r\nhave such briefings at regular intervals, such as once a \r\nmonth. \r\n It is imperative for us to strengthen the capacity \r\nof the General Assembly to implement its resolutions. \r\nAt the same time, we should not overburden the General \r\nAssembly with repetitive and obsolete mandates. \r\n The image and authority of the General Assembly \r\nreflects upon the image of the United Nations. If we \r\nfail to revitalize this most important organ, our \r\nOrganization will not serve the purpose it was created \r\nfor. Therefore, we must strive to make the General \r\nAssembly more proactive, stronger and more efficient. \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n25 08-61155 \r\n \r\n On behalf of the delegation of Nepal, I would like \r\nto pledge our strong support for the continuous \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly so as to make it \r\ncapable of taking on the numerous challenges we are \r\nfacing today, with a view to enabling it to fulfil the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations, as per its Charter. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Venezuela) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to express our appreciation to \r\nthe presidency for the way in which it has carried out \r\nthe work of this General Assembly and for addressing \r\none of the most important issues on the United Nations \r\nagenda. \r\n May I also express our gratitude for the work \r\ndone by the facilitators of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\non the revitalization of the General Assembly, \r\nAmbassador Eladio Loizaga, Permanent Representative \r\nof the Republic of Paraguay, and Ambassador Andrzej \r\nTowpik, Permanent Representative of Poland. \r\n We also explicitly associate ourselves with the \r\nstatement of the Ambassador of Algeria, on behalf of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is \r\ntoday a fundamental element not only of the reform \r\nprocess of the United Nations system, but also of the \r\nprocess of adjustments and changes demanded by \r\npeople throughout the world, made urgent by the \r\ngreatest crisis of capitalism since the Second World \r\nWar and manifested, in all its poignancy, in the \r\nfinancial crisis that is affecting the world today. \r\n We find ourselves at a historic time, when the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the principal deliberative, standard-\r\nsetting and representative organ of the United Nations \r\nand the sole multilateral, universal intergovernmental \r\nforum, must at last show leadership on today’s global \r\nissues. Thus, we believe that the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is a task that cannot be delayed. \r\n Revitalizing the General Assembly means its \r\nstrengthening as a special forum to promote dialogue \r\nand cooperation in the search for solutions to problems \r\naffecting peace and the social and economic \r\ndevelopment of peoples. The revitalization must \r\nprovide for full respect of the powers and functions of \r\nthis highest forum, as set forth in the Charter, with \r\nstrengthened coordination of its work, particularly with \r\nthe Security Council.  \r\n We also believe that revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly must be geared to ensuring that the United \r\nNations can respond effectively and legitimately in \r\nmatters concerning the promotion of peace. But the \r\nAssembly should also address the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental issues affecting the poor of the world, \r\ngiven the consequences for world security and stability \r\nand the horribly unjust inequalities prevailing in the \r\nworld, in particular in developing countries.  \r\n The process of revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nis contingent on the political will of member States. \r\nThe process must be based on the principles of \r\ndemocracy, transparency and accountability by means \r\nof open and participative consultations. We deeply \r\nbelieve that the process of strengthening and reforming \r\nthe Assembly will be possible only if the principles and \r\npurposes of the Charter and the resolutions of the \r\nAssembly are fully respected by all States, without \r\nexception, regardless of the role they play today on the \r\ninternational scene in building a multipolar world. \r\nThere must therefore be no first-class and second-class \r\ncountries. The legal equality of States and respect for \r\nsovereignty and self-determination must be the pillars \r\nof an Organization based on equity and fairness.  \r\n The President of the General Assembly can count \r\non the support and contribution of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela to the strengthening of the role \r\nof the Assembly and its revitalization, one of the \r\nunresolved issues facing humanity today. I also assure \r\nhim that our delegation will actively participate in the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which, as he knows, is working in \r\naccordance with resolution 62/276.  \r\n Ms. Espinosa (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation would like to begin by associating itself \r\nwith the statement made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.  \r\n My delegation would like to reiterate its \r\ncongratulations and gratitude for the excellent job done \r\nby the co-facilitators, Ambassador Eladio Loizaga, \r\nPermanent Representative of Paraguay, and Ambassador \r\nAndrzej Towpik, Permanent Representative of Poland. \r\nWe acknowledge their leadership, the transparency \r\nwith which they conducted the consultations and their \r\nefficient work in carrying out a careful inventory of the \r\nimplementation of resolutions on this matter, through \r\nwhich we can now analyse the status of the mandates \r\nof the various resolutions. This process led to the \r\nadoption of resolution 62/276 by consensus, which \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 26 \r\n \r\ndemonstrated the political will of our States to \r\nstrengthen the General Assembly and re-establish its \r\nauthority. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is a \r\ncentral element in the genuine reform of the United \r\nNations. It is of paramount importance to reassert the \r\nkey role of the Assembly as the principle deliberative, \r\nnormative, and policymaking organ and as the organ \r\nthat is the most representative of the States Members of \r\nthe Organization. Since a balance must be struck \r\nbetween the principle organs of the United Nations, \r\nMember States must strengthen the thematic agenda of \r\nthe Assembly and ensure that the Security Council \r\nfulfils its objectives and mandates in accordance with \r\nthe principles set forth in the United Nations Charter. \r\n Today’s world demands that the General Assembly \r\npronounce itself in a timely, informed and decisive \r\nmanner on those matters that affect and concern all of \r\nus. The financial, food, energy and climate change \r\ncrises require careful analysis, concerted responses, \r\npolitical commitments and guidelines for action. This \r\nis the role of the Assembly, and we therefore welcome \r\nthe initiative of the President of the General Assembly \r\nto convene a discussion panel on the financial crisis \r\nand to create a group of experts providing Member \r\nStates with detailed information, analysis and \r\nalternative ways out of the financial crisis.  \r\n We must also work on the three pillars recognized \r\nby heads of State in the 2005 World Summit Outcome: \r\nsecurity, development and the environment. Thus, it \r\nmust be recognized that all United Nations organs must \r\nwork in a coordinated fashion on these matters. It is \r\nalso important that the outcome of the deliberations \r\nand the commitments undertaken as a result of those \r\ndeliberations receive public recognition and recognition \r\nby the international community as a whole. The \r\npromotion of the work carried out by our Organization \r\nmust be made known and accepted not just by our \r\nGovernments, but by all social actors and by public \r\nopinion in general.  \r\n It is therefore imperative that the mandate for \r\nrevitalization include urgent measures to improve and \r\nstrengthen interaction between the Secretariat and the \r\nGeneral Assembly so that the implementation of \r\nmandates can be carried out effectively. It is urgent for \r\nus to work on improving the mechanisms of \r\ninteraction, monitoring and accountability between the \r\nvarious organs of the system.  \r\n Ecuador also believes it necessary to define in \r\ngreater detail the road map and results achieved at this \r\nsession regarding the matter we are addressing today. \r\nMy delegation believes that we are meeting at a special \r\ntime, since the President of the Assembly has given \r\nhigh priority to the democratization of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The revitalization of the Assembly is the \r\ncornerstone of this process. It is therefore important to \r\nmove resolutely forward and to continue on this path, \r\nwhich has proven itself to be open, inclusive and \r\ntransparent. We now need to achieve more tangible \r\nresults that improve the balance between the various \r\norgans of the system and efficiency in the \r\npolicymaking and deliberative work of the General \r\nAssembly and in the implementation of the agreements \r\nand mandates of the Assembly.  \r\n In conclusion, Ecuador reiterates its ongoing \r\nreadiness to support the actions of the Chairman of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in order to achieve progress in this \r\nregard. The President of the Assembly can therefore \r\nrest assured of the support and active participation of \r\nmy delegation. \r\n Mr. Siva (India): India is happy to participate in \r\nthe debate on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. This is one of the most important issues on \r\nthe agenda of the Assembly at its sixty-third session, as \r\nit addresses fundamental questions about the structure \r\nand functioning of the world order. \r\n India would like to align itself with the statement \r\non this issue made by the delegation of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n My delegation would like to take note of the \r\nproceedings of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly created \r\npursuant to a decision of the Assembly at its sixty-first \r\nsession. The Group has painstakingly catalogued \r\ndecisions in this regard and divided them into three \r\nmain clusters. These clusters deal with, first, working \r\nmethods, documentation and agenda, inter alia; \r\nsecondly, selection of the Secretary-General; and \r\nfinally, the role and authority of the Assembly. This \r\nhelps us obtain an overview of where the revitalization \r\nprocess stands. \r\n A review of the situation reveals, to our regret \r\nalthough perhaps not to our surprise, that very limited \r\n A/63/PV.56\r\n \r\n27 08-61155 \r\n \r\nprogress has been made on this issue since it was \r\nintroduced into the agenda of the General Assembly at \r\nits forty-sixth session. My delegation acknowledges the \r\nimportance of progress where it has taken place, \r\nparticularly in those areas where practical results have \r\nbeen obtained. However, there is a limit to the extent to \r\nwhich discussions relating to time limits on speeches \r\nand provisions relating to modern technologies will \r\nrevitalize the Assembly. \r\n India’s position on this issue is guided by its \r\ndesire to have a more effective United Nations. India \r\nalso wants an Organization that is more responsive to \r\nthe priorities and aspirations of the Member States, \r\nparticularly the developing countries, which constitute \r\nthe vast majority of Member States. \r\n India believes that the General Assembly will not \r\nbe empowered merely by strengthening procedures. It \r\nwill be empowered only if its position as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations is respected in letter and in spirit. \r\nThis requires that the Assembly take the lead in setting \r\nthe global agenda. The convening power of the United \r\nNations must be used more decisively, particularly on \r\neconomic issues. The Assembly must also restore the \r\ncentrality of the United Nations in development matters. \r\nThe thematic debates have been a step forward, as have \r\nbeen the annual ministerial review and the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. However, more needs to be done. \r\n The benefits of involving the General Assembly \r\nin international economic governance have been made \r\nevident during the current financial crisis. A section of \r\nits membership drawn from the global South has \r\nconsistently pointed out that the economic orthodoxies \r\nproposed by a group of nations have grave \r\nshortcomings. These fears, often voiced in this \r\nAssembly and its Committees, have been validated by \r\nrecent events. Events have also underscored the \r\nimportance of giving a representative body such as the \r\nAssembly a much greater say in shaping the \r\ninternational economic and financial architecture, \r\nparticularly in the reform of the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions. \r\n Control over legislation, over materials and over \r\nmen confers power. Within the United Nations system, \r\nit is the Security Council, with its opaque working \r\nmethods and widely accepted need for reform, that \r\ncontrols certain vital legislation and senior manpower. \r\nWhile the Assembly has some influence through the \r\nFifth Committee and the budgetary process, there is a \r\nfundamental disparity of authority between the Council \r\nand the Assembly. \r\n One of the more egregious examples of how \r\ndisparity manifests itself is through the process of \r\nselecting the Secretary-General. India’s view is that the \r\nGeneral Assembly, being the voice of the international \r\ncommunity, must be given a greater say in the process \r\nof selection. Several mechanisms to put in place a \r\nmore inclusive and transparent procedure for the \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General, in accordance \r\nwith Article 97 of the Charter, have been proposed. \r\nEfforts in this direction are better undertaken when a \r\nselection process is not on the horizon or under way. \r\nThis is an appropriate time. \r\n In our view, the appointment of high-ranking \r\nUnited Nations officials at the level of Under-\r\nSecretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General should \r\nalso be subject to scrutiny by the general body of the \r\nMember States as represented through the General \r\nAssembly. Thus, candidates for such senior positions \r\nshould be required to be confirmed by the Assembly. \r\nThis practice is observed in many countries and is \r\nconsistent with the principles of democracy and \r\nrepresentative governance. \r\n The issue of preventing encroachment upon the \r\nmandate of the General Assembly and of making the \r\nSecurity Council more responsive to it must also be \r\naddressed. The Assembly’s competence in areas such \r\nas the process of standard-setting and codification of \r\ninternational law must be scrupulously respected. \r\n I would like to conclude by submitting that it is \r\nonly the presence of political will that will revitalize \r\nand empower the General Assembly. It is only political \r\nwill that will provide the Assembly with the tools and \r\nthe mechanisms that will enable it to have a role in the \r\nmaking and implementation of international law and in \r\nthe creation and maintenance of a just and equitable \r\nworld order. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly has \r\nbeen on its agenda for the past 18 years. India believes \r\nthat there must be meaningful progress in the areas I \r\nhave outlined to prevent this debate from becoming a \r\nsterile discussion. \r\n Mr. Tarragô (Brazil): It is no coincidence that \r\nthe joint debate on the report of the Security Council \r\nA/63/PV.56  \r\n \r\n08-61155 28 \r\n \r\nand the reform of that organ has been almost \r\nimmediately followed by the debate on the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly. Linking them is a common \r\nthread: the unique role and authority of the Assembly \r\nand the need to keep it strong and relevant in its \r\nrelation with other principal organs and with the \r\ninternational community as a whole. This has been one \r\nof the priorities of the current President of the General \r\nAssembly, even since before he took office, and my \r\ndelegation welcomes his leadership in this endeavour. \r\n Much has been said on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and, in line with resolutions we \r\nhave adopted, I will be brief.  \r\n There are several aspects to the matter, many of \r\nthem of high political significance. Among them, I \r\nwould single out the role of the General Assembly in \r\nthe selection of the Secretary-General and the \r\nrelationship between the Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil. But today, I wish to mention one element that \r\nmy delegation deems crucial: the role of this body \r\nitself in its revitalization. \r\n To a large extent, it is up to the member States \r\nrepresented in this Hall to take the measures needed to \r\nmaintain the vitality of the General Assembly. The \r\nCharter grants it full authority to consider whatever \r\nissue it sees fit, including those related to international \r\npeace and security, without prejudice to the functions \r\nand powers of the Security Council. We are masters of \r\nour agenda and of our political initiatives. We should \r\nuse that authority and clout to preserve the Assembly \r\nas a central actor in the international system. \r\n This is something we have been doing more and \r\nmore often in recent years. The thematic and \r\ninteractive debates and similar actions constitute a \r\nperfect example. They help to keep the General \r\nAssembly involved in the discussion of key global \r\nproblems. More importantly, they contribute to \r\ngenerating global responses to such problems. This is \r\nthe case, for example, with the debate organized by the \r\nPresident of the Assembly this past October on the \r\ncurrent financial crisis. \r\n We can also ensure the vitality of the General \r\nAssembly — and, depending on the issue, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council — by exploring their \r\nfunctions as channels of communication between \r\nlimited-composition initiatives and the larger \r\ninternational community. One good example, once \r\nagain in the economic domain, is the financial crisis. \r\nThe Assembly, with a political approach, and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, with a technical one, \r\ncould help to articulate what is being discussed \r\nelsewhere in the international financial institutions and \r\nrelated forums and involve the broader membership of \r\nthe United Nations. Each instance has its proper role to \r\nplay, and we should be cognizant of their specificities, \r\nbut they can certainly establish a dialogue and profit \r\nfrom that dialogue. \r\n All this, and more, is within our power. It is a \r\nmatter of us having the will to take up issues and \r\narticulate initiatives. The General Assembly is unique, \r\nas it brings together the whole of the international \r\ncommunity. We, the member States, should be diligent \r\nand sometimes bold enough to use it to promote the \r\nrealization of the goals enshrined in the Charter and \r\nagreed to in numerous instruments. Every time the \r\nAssembly acts, we become more likely to make a \r\ndifference on the ground, even if indirectly.  \r\n We should not shy away from negotiating the \r\nrequired decisions to make the United Nations and its \r\norgans more legitimate, democratic and representative. \r\nIn so doing, we will be working to allay the threats to \r\nlife on the planet and improve the well-being of our \r\npeoples.   \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. The Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 110. \r\nThe meeting was adjourned at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
