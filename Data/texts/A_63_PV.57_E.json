(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 64 \r\n \r\nPromotion and protection of human rights \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/63/L.31) \r\n \r\n The President: Before we proceed, I would like \r\nto inform Member States that, on behalf of the entire \r\nmembership, representatives of all regional groups — \r\nAlgeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Germany and \r\nIndonesia — were appointed as facilitators by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly in connection with \r\ndraft resolution before us today. As a result, no more \r\nsponsors will be accepted for draft resolution \r\nA/63/L.31. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/63/L.31, entitled “Commemoration of the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights”. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/63/L.31? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n63/25). \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The General \r\nAssembly has concluded this stage of its consideration \r\nof agenda item 64. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 16 \r\n \r\nQuestion of Palestine \r\n \r\n  Report of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People \r\n(A/63/35) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/368) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/63/L.32, A/63/L.33, \r\nA/63/L.34 and A/63/L.35) \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The President: I am pleased to open this plenary \r\nmeeting, in which we take up the question of Palestine. \r\nThis morning, with heavy hearts, we observed the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. I joined His Excellency Ambassador Paul \r\nBadji, Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, and \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon to voice our ongoing \r\nconcern about the terrible situation in the Gaza Strip \r\nand the West Bank and to express our solidarity with \r\nthat long-suffering people. \r\n We heard the comprehensive report of the \r\nChairman on the current situation of Palestinians living \r\nunder occupation. As well, the Secretary-General \r\nsummarized the complex initiatives that are being \r\nundertaken by the international community to move \r\nforward peace talks and the establishment of the \r\nPalestinian State. I urged the international community \r\nto raise its voice against the collective punishment of \r\nthe people of Gaza, a policy that we cannot tolerate. \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 2 \r\n \r\nWe demand an end to that massive abuse of human \r\nrights and call on Israel, the occupying Power, to allow \r\nhumanitarian and other supplies to enter the Gaza Strip \r\nwithout delay. \r\n I spoke this morning about apartheid and how \r\nIsraeli policies in the occupied Palestinian territories \r\nappear so similar to the apartheid of an earlier era a \r\ncontinent away. I believe it is very important that we in \r\nthe United Nations use that term. We must not be afraid \r\nto call something what it is. It is the United Nations, \r\nafter all, that adopted the International Convention on \r\nthe Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of \r\nApartheid, making clear to the entire world that such \r\npractices of official discrimination must be outlawed \r\nwherever they occur. \r\n We heard today from a representative of South \r\nAfrican civil society. We know that civil society \r\norganizations all around the world are working to \r\ndefend Palestinian rights and are trying to protect the \r\nPalestinian population, which we, the United Nations, \r\nare failing to protect. More than 20 years ago, we in \r\nthe United Nations took the lead from civil society \r\nwhen we agreed that sanctions were required to \r\nprovide a non-violent means of pressuring South Africa \r\nto end its violations. Today, perhaps we in the United \r\nNations should consider following the lead of a new \r\ngeneration of civil society, who are calling for a similar \r\nnon-violent campaign of boycott, divestment and \r\nsanctions to pressure Israel to end its violations. \r\n I have attended a great many meetings on the \r\nrights of the Palestinian people. I am amazed at how \r\npeople continue to insist on patience while our brothers \r\nand sisters are being crucified. Patience is a virtue in \r\nwhich I believe, but there is nothing virtuous about \r\nbeing patient with the suffering of others. We must \r\nendeavour, with all our heart, to put an end to the \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people. \r\n I have great love for the Jewish people, and that \r\nhas been true all my life. I have never hesitated to \r\ncondemn the crimes of the Holocaust or any of the \r\nmany abuses committed against our Jewish brothers \r\nand sisters. However, their suffering does not give \r\nanyone the right to abuse others, especially those who \r\nhistorically have such deep and exemplary relations \r\nwith the Jewish people. \r\n Having said that, I would like to remind our \r\nIsraeli brothers and sisters that, even though they have \r\nthe protective shield of the United States in the \r\nSecurity Council, no amount of arm twisting and \r\nintimidation will change resolution 181 (II), which was \r\nadopted 61 years ago and called for the creation of two \r\nStates. Shamefully, there is no Palestinian State to \r\ncelebrate today, and the prospects are as distant as ever. \r\nAll explanations notwithstanding, that central fact \r\nmakes a mockery of the United Nations and gravely \r\nhurts its image and prestige. How can we continue like \r\nthat? I urge the international community to defuse the \r\npolitical deadlock that cynically perpetuates that \r\nhatred, isolation and abuse. Our solidarity must prompt \r\nconcrete action to realize those elusive rights, which \r\nmost of us can take for granted.  \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Paul \r\nBadji of Senegal, who will speak in his capacity as \r\nChairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike, at the outset, on behalf of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, to most sincerely thank all who participated \r\nthis morning in the special meeting held to observe the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. On that solemn occasion, the importance and \r\nurgency of achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting \r\nsolution to the question of Palestine was forcefully and \r\nunanimously reaffirmed. There was also considerable \r\nsupport for the exercise by the Palestinian people of its \r\ninalienable rights. \r\n Before I introduce the four draft resolutions that \r\nthe Committee has prepared under the agenda item \r\nunder consideration, I should like to make some brief \r\nremarks with regard to the situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory and on developments in the \r\npolitical process. \r\n One year ago, the international community as a \r\nwhole welcomed the holding of an international \r\nconference at Annapolis convened by the United States \r\nof America to follow up an initiative by the Quartet. \r\nThe Conference led to the resumption of the political \r\nprocess between Israelis and Palestinians and elicited \r\nan unprecedented level of political, economic and \r\nfinancial support by the international community for \r\nthe Palestinian Authority, and subsequently led to \r\nsubstantial pledges at the donors’ conference held in \r\nParis in December 2007. The Committee joined the \r\ngroundswell to relaunch the peace process and, in the \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n3 08-61587 \r\n \r\ncontext of its programme of work, worked to establish \r\nan environment conducive to advancing permanent \r\nstatus negotiations. \r\n Under the auspices of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, the Secretariat’s Division for Palestinian \r\nRights organized three major international meetings in \r\n2008. The Palestinian Reform and Development Plan \r\nwas at the heart of the debate that took place at the \r\nUnited Nations seminar on assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople held in February 2008 at Amman, during which \r\ndonors were encouraged to become active participants \r\nin the implementation of the Plan. The seminar also \r\nmade it possible to undertake an assessment of the \r\nnumerous obstacles impeding the achievement of that \r\ngoal, namely, the hundreds of checkpoints and the \r\nroutine closure of the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nwhich stifle economic development, the expansion of \r\nsettlements and the construction of the wall on \r\nPalestinian land, which further fragments the West \r\nBank.  \r\n The delegation that represented the Committee at \r\nthe seminar took up the situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, during a \r\nmeeting with the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nJordan. Following the Amman seminar, a delegation of \r\nthe Committee visited two refugee camps in Jordan and \r\nobtained first-hand knowledge of the living conditions \r\nof its inhabitants. \r\n The United Nations International Conference on \r\nPalestine Refugees, which was organized by the \r\nCommittee in April at the Paris headquarters of \r\nUNESCO, took up the issue of the many Palestinians \r\nforced to live for over 60 years in refugee camps in the \r\nWest Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic. Participants at the Conference \r\nstressed the fact that a durable solution to the Palestine \r\nrefugee problem and to the Israeli Palestinian conflict \r\ncould only be achieved if those refugees could exercise \r\ntheir inalienable right to return to their homes and to \r\nrecover the property of which they had been deprived.  \r\n The Conference highlighted that the right of \r\nreturn of refugees, which is a fundamental and widely \r\nacknowledged humanitarian and human rights \r\nprinciple, did not diminish with the passage of time \r\nand remained fully applicable to Palestine refugees. \r\nParticipants in the Conference also unreservedly \r\nsupported the resumption in the political process. \r\nHowever, they cautioned that any final Israeli-\r\nPalestinian peace agreement must encompass a just and \r\nfair solution to the Palestine refugee question.  \r\n The Committee’s delegation took advantage of its \r\nstay in Paris to meet with officials of the French \r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs and with French \r\nparliamentarians at the Palais Bourbon and Palais \r\ndu Luxembourg. Those meetings resulted in useful \r\nexchanges of views on the role of the European Union, \r\nthe United Nations and the Committee in international \r\nefforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \r\n In June 2008 in Malta, the Committee held the \r\nUnited Nations International Meeting on the Question \r\nof Palestine to assess difficulties impeding the parties \r\nfrom making progress in the peace process. \r\nParticipants at the Meeting expressed particular \r\nconcern about the ongoing expansion of settlements in \r\nthe West Bank and East Jerusalem and the continuation \r\nof the construction of the wall, both of which are \r\ncontrary to international law and serve to prejudge, as \r\nhas been pointed out numerous times, the outcome of \r\npermanent status negotiations.  \r\n While affirming that acts of violence by either \r\nside were damaging to the political dialogue, the Malta \r\nMeeting also expressed support for every effort to \r\nachieve a ceasefire. It also welcomed the important \r\nrole played by European countries and encouraged \r\nthem to become more active in various aspects of the \r\npolitical process.  \r\n The Committee’s delegation to the Meeting also \r\nmet with Malta’s President and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs. On its return through Rome, it also visited \r\nVatican City to meet with the Secretary for Relations \r\nwith States of the Holy See. \r\n I should now like to highlight an important aspect \r\nof the mandate conferred upon the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople by the General Assembly, so as to illustrate how \r\nthe Committee contributes to the comprehensive efforts \r\nof the United Nations to find a peaceful solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine through the establishment of a \r\nPalestinian State living side by side with Israel in \r\npeace and security. \r\n Having listened to assessments by Palestinian and \r\nIsraeli experts and the analyses made by renowned \r\ninternational specialists on the issue, the Committee \r\nconcluded that there is a widening gap and stark \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 4 \r\n \r\ndiscrepancy between bilateral negotiations, the efforts \r\nof the international community and the deteriorating \r\nsituation on the ground. Even more worrying are the \r\nongoing settlement activities, the blockade of Gaza, the \r\nconstruction of the wall on Palestinian land, the \r\ndemolition of houses in East Jerusalem, the daily \r\nincursions by the Israeli army into Palestinian areas \r\nand violence by Israeli settlers — all of which threaten \r\nto derail already fragile negotiations. \r\n Today, one year after the Annapolis Conference, \r\nthe Committee cannot but encourage the parties to \r\ncontinue the political process by building on the \r\nachievements. The only solution is to undertake serious \r\nnegotiations on the substantive issues. At the same \r\ntime, actions on the ground must change dramatically. \r\nSettlement activities must be stopped. Extremists must \r\nbe brought to justice for their acts of violence. The \r\nblockade of Gaza must be lifted. The ceasefire should \r\nbe maintained and expanded to the West Bank. \r\nEconomic activity should be relaunched in the \r\nPalestinian territories by lifting restrictions on the \r\nmovement of people and goods. Those measures will \r\nmake it possible to restore confidence in the peace \r\nprocess and to gradually build public support among \r\nPalestinians and Israelis. That will allow the parties to \r\ntake decisions, even though they may appear difficult \r\nat the moment. \r\n The Committee believes that the basic reason for \r\nthe conflict continues to be the ongoing illegal \r\noccupation of Palestinian territory. We emphasize the \r\nurgent need to find a negotiated solution that will end \r\nthe occupation, ensure that the Palestinian people can \r\nexercise their inalienable rights and guarantee the \r\nsecurity of the State of Israel. Such a settlement must \r\nbe based on international law, Assembly resolution \r\n194 (III), Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), \r\n338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003), other \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions and the principles \r\noutlined in the road map and the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n The Committee continues to be extremely \r\nconcerned about internal Palestinian divisions, which \r\npose obstacles to national reconciliation and the \r\nreunification of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip \r\nunder the control of the Palestinian Authority. The \r\nCommittee supports efforts by Arab and other \r\ncountries, as well as the initiatives of the President of \r\nthe Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, aimed at \r\nrestoring the national unity necessary for embarking on \r\nthe path towards a permanent settlement of the \r\nquestion of Palestine. \r\n The Committee firmly believes that the United \r\nNations should continue to maintain its permanent \r\nresponsibility with regard to the question of Palestine \r\nuntil it is resolved in all its aspects in accordance with \r\ninternational legitimacy. The Committee calls on the \r\nSecurity Council to act decisively to implement its own \r\nresolutions regarding the question of Palestine, in \r\nparticular resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The \r\nCommittee also expects that the Council — on which \r\nthe primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security has been conferred — \r\nwill fulfil its obligations under the Charter. For its part, \r\nthe Committee will continue to fulfil the mandate \r\nentrusted to it by the General Assembly, so as to help \r\nthe Palestinian people achieve its inalienable rights. \r\n In this context, I would now like to introduce to \r\nthe General Assembly the four draft resolutions \r\napproved by the Committee and circulated under the \r\nagenda item under consideration, namely, A/63/L.32, \r\nA/63/L.33, A/63/L.34 and A/63/L.35. \r\n The first three draft resolutions concern the work \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People, the Division for \r\nPalestinian Rights of the Secretariat and the special \r\ninformation programme on the question of Palestine of \r\nthe Department of Public Information of the \r\nSecretariat. Those draft resolutions reaffirm the \r\nimportant mandates entrusted to those three entities by \r\nthe Assembly. As in the past, the Committee intends to \r\nmake sure that resources available to it are used \r\njudiciously to carry out all the activities envisaged. The \r\nthree draft resolutions have also been updated. \r\n The fourth draft resolution, which is entitled \r\n“Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine”, \r\nreiterates the position of the General Assembly with \r\nregard to the essential elements of such a settlement \r\nand includes references to the developments of the past \r\nyear. The draft resolution notes with satisfaction, \r\namong other things, the international community’s \r\nredoubled efforts to support the political process, the \r\nreaffirmation of the Arab Peace Initiative and the \r\nfollow-up steps undertaken by Arab States, as well as \r\nthe activities by the Quartet and its Special \r\nRepresentative. \r\n The four draft resolutions that I have just \r\nintroduced outline positions, mandates and \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n5 08-61587 \r\n \r\nprogrammes that are of special importance, particularly \r\nat this crucial moment. I call on the General Assembly \r\nto vote in favour of those draft resolutions and to \r\nsupport the important goals contained therein. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Saviour Borg of Malta, \r\nRapporteur of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to \r\nintroduce the Committee’s report.  \r\n Mr. Borg (Malta): It is an honour for me, in my \r\ncapacity as the Rapporteur of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, to introduce to the General Assembly the \r\nannual report of the Committee, which is contained in \r\ndocument A/63/35. Allow me to summarize each \r\nsection of the report. \r\n Chapter I contains the introduction, which \r\noutlines the Committee’s objectives and its general \r\nperspective on the events that have taken place in the \r\ncourse of the past year. The chapter highlights, in \r\nparagraph 4, “the dichotomy between the resumption \r\nof the Israeli-Palestinian political negotiations and \r\nintensified international engagement on the issue, and a \r\ndeteriorating situation on the ground”. \r\n Chapters II and III summarize the mandates \r\nentrusted by the General Assembly to the Committee, \r\nthe Division for Palestinian Rights and the Department \r\nof Public Information. They also contain information \r\non the organization of the Committee’s work during the \r\nyear under review. Those two Chapters also reconfirm \r\nthe Committee’s declared position that all United \r\nNations Member States and Observers wishing to \r\nparticipate in the work of the Committee as observers \r\nare welcome to do so. \r\n Chapter IV reviews the situation relating to the \r\nquestion of Palestine and the relevant political \r\ndevelopments as monitored by the Committee during \r\nthe year in the occupied Palestinian territory, including \r\nEast Jerusalem. That includes the situation of \r\nPalestinian refugees; the Israel Defense Forces’ deadly \r\nmilitary incursions into the Gaza Strip, which have \r\nresulted in a large number of civilian casualties; the \r\nrocket and other attacks by Palestinian militants \r\nagainst Israeli civilians; the Egyptian-mediated \r\nceasefire in the Gaza Strip between Israel and \r\nPalestinian groups; and efforts aimed at Palestinian \r\nnational reconciliation. \r\n Also in that Chapter, the Committee denounces \r\nthe excessive and indiscriminate use of force by Israel, \r\nthe occupying Power, against the Palestinian civilian \r\npopulation in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, and condemns extrajudicial \r\nkillings, the destruction of Palestinian homes, civilian \r\ninfrastructure and agricultural lands and the attendant \r\ndevastating effects on the Palestinian population. At \r\nthe same time, the Committee strongly condemns all \r\nattacks against Israeli civilians and infrastructure. \r\n That Chapter also addresses other issues of \r\nserious concern, including the increasing number of \r\nobstacles to movement and access; the continued \r\nconstruction of the separation wall, in contravention of \r\nthe Advisory Opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice; the demolition of Palestinian homes; the \r\ncontinued blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza \r\nStrip, which is obstructing the movement of persons \r\nand goods and exacerbating the humanitarian situation \r\nin the Gaza Strip; the detention of approximately \r\n11,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons; Israel’s \r\ncontinued settlement expansion activity; the continued \r\nviolence, harassment and intimidation by settlers \r\nagainst Palestinian civilians; the water crisis \r\nthroughout the occupied Palestinian territory; the \r\ndeterioration of the agricultural sector; the halting of \r\nthe import of fuel, food and medical and relief items; \r\nand the difficulties still faced by the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East in carrying out its mandate. \r\n The political developments reviewed in that \r\nChapter include the convening of the Annapolis \r\nconference and the Israeli-Palestinian joint \r\nunderstanding reached at the conference, as well as the \r\nParis international donors’ conference and the resulting \r\n$7.4 billion in pledges. The Chapter also highlights the \r\nefforts being made by the Palestinian Authority to \r\nadvance economic development, as well as the \r\nimportant role being played by the Quartet and its \r\nrepresentative, Mr. Tony Blair. \r\n Chapter V reviews the action taken by the \r\nCommittee to mobilize the international community in \r\nsupport of the Palestinian people, in cooperation with \r\nUnited Nations bodies, Governments, intergovernmental \r\nand civil society organizations and others. It is divided \r\ninto two main sections. Section A describes action in \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, as \r\nwell as statements issued by the Committee’s Bureau. \r\nSection B contains a detailed account of the \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 6 \r\n \r\nimplementation of the programme of work and \r\nactivities of the Committee and the Division. It also \r\nprovides information on the continued dialogue \r\nbetween the Committee and members of the European \r\nUnion and other intergovernmental organizations. \r\n Sub-section 1 gives an account of the various \r\ninternational meetings and conferences organized in \r\nthe course of the year, including those held in Amman, \r\nParis and Malta. The Committee’s delegation also met \r\nat Vatican City with the Secretary of Relations with \r\nStates of the Holy See. \r\n Sub-sections 2 to 7 deal with the Committee’s \r\ncooperation with intergovernmental organizations and \r\ncivil society, including parliaments and inter-\r\nparliamentary organizations; the Division’s research, \r\nmonitoring and publications work; the administration, \r\nmaintenance, expansion and development of the United \r\nNations Information System on the Question of \r\nPalestine (UNISPAL); the training programme for staff \r\nof the Palestinian Authority; and the observance of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople held here in New York, in Geneva and in \r\nVienna. \r\n Chapter VI provides an overview of the work \r\ndone over the year by the Department of Public \r\nInformation (DPI) in pursuance of General Assembly \r\nresolution 62/82 of 10 December 2007, whose \r\nobjective is to raise international awareness on the \r\nquestion of Palestine and on the situation in the Middle \r\nEast with a view to contributing effectively to an \r\natmosphere conducive to dialogue and supportive of \r\nthe peace process. Important contributions by DPI \r\nincluded the coverage of intergovernmental meetings, \r\nreports by the United Nations Radio Arabic Language \r\nUnit of meetings organized by the Committee, the \r\nhighlighting of stories by the United Nations News \r\nCentre, a training programme for young Palestinian \r\njournalists, the permanent exhibits at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters and at Geneva, and the dissemination of \r\ninformation by United Nations information centres, \r\nservices and offices. \r\n The last chapter of the report contains the \r\nconclusions and recommendations of the Committee. \r\nIn that chapter, the Committee notes that the year 2008 \r\nmarked 60 years of Palestinian dispossession — the \r\nNakba — and reiterates the permanent responsibility of \r\nthe United Nations towards the question of Palestine \r\nuntil it is resolved in all its aspects in accordance with \r\ninternational law. \r\n Encouraged by the outcome of the Annapolis \r\nconference and the Paris donors’ conference, the \r\nCommittee stresses the need for a complete cessation \r\nof all acts of violence, including military attacks, \r\ndestruction and acts of terror. It calls upon Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, to end its illegal policies and \r\noppressive practices in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem, such as settlement \r\nactivities, the construction of the wall and numerous \r\nmeasures of collective punishment.  \r\n The Committee also emphasizes the importance \r\nfor both sides to implement their road map obligations. \r\nThe Committee also stresses that the political \r\nmomentum provided by the Annapolis and Paris \r\nconferences must not be lost, and supports all efforts \r\ntowards the goal of achieving a final status agreement \r\nby the end of 2008. \r\n The Committee expresses its view that the illegal \r\nIsraeli occupation of the Palestinian territory must end \r\nwithout conditions, which should allow the Palestinian \r\npeople to establish an independent State on all \r\nterritories occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, \r\nand to exercise their inalienable rights, including the \r\nright to self-determination.  \r\n The Committee also expresses its firm support for \r\nthe two-State solution, in accordance with Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 \r\n(2002) and 1515 (2003). The Arab Peace Initiative \r\nremains a crucial element for advancing peace in the \r\nregion.  \r\n While welcoming the unwavering and substantial \r\nbudgetary support for the Palestinian Authority by the \r\nEuropean Union and other major donors, the \r\nCommittee encourages member States of the European \r\nUnion to take a more proactive role in international \r\nefforts at resolving the conflict. The Committee also \r\ncalls upon all donors to live up to their pledges in order \r\nto ensure the continued functioning of the institutions \r\nof the Palestinian Authority. \r\n The Committee calls upon Israel to end its \r\nmilitary operations in the occupied Palestinian territory \r\nand to stop any other measures that further undermine \r\nPalestinian institutions. The Committee expresses its \r\nstrong opposition to the illegal construction and \r\nexpansion of settlements in the West Bank, as well as \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n7 08-61587 \r\n \r\nthe unlawful construction of the wall, and finds those \r\nactivities incompatible with negotiations on a \r\npermanent settlement.  \r\n The Committee again reminds Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, that it is bound by the Geneva \r\nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian \r\nPersons in Time of War, which, inter alia, obliges \r\nparties to the Convention to protect civilians during \r\nhostilities. The Committee also calls on Israel to \r\nrelease, immediately and unconditionally, all \r\nPalestinian prisoners, including imprisoned Cabinet \r\nmembers and parliamentarians. Also, the Committee \r\nstrongly condemns the killing of innocent civilians by \r\neither side, denounces rocket attacks on Israel and calls \r\nfor a cessation of those activities by Palestinian armed \r\ngroups. \r\n The Committee calls upon the Palestinian \r\nleadership, the leaders of all factions and all \r\nPalestinians to unite in support of President Abbas, his \r\nGovernment and all democratically elected Palestinian \r\ninstitutions, and to resolve their political differences by \r\npeaceful means. The Committee also calls for a \r\ncomprehensive national dialogue, supported by \r\nconfidence-building measures, to start a process of \r\nregaining national unity and the reunification of Gaza \r\nand the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. \r\n The Committee, convinced that its own work and \r\nthe programme of mandated activities of the Division \r\nfor Palestinian Rights represent a significant \r\ncontribution by the United Nations and its membership \r\nin the search for a solution to the question of Palestine, \r\nalso emphasizes the useful and constructive \r\ncontribution of the Division for Palestinian Rights of \r\nthe Secretariat in support of its mandate aimed at \r\nenabling the Palestinian people to exercise their \r\ninalienable rights. \r\n The Committee stresses that its programme of \r\ninternational meetings and conferences contributes to \r\nfocusing the attention of Governments, \r\nintergovernmental and civil society organizations and \r\nthe general public on the need to advance a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the conflict and to mobilize much-needed \r\nassistance for the Palestinian people. It also suggests, \r\nin its report, themes for its programme of meetings for \r\nthe year 2009. \r\n The Committee commends civil society \r\norganizations for their efforts to uphold international \r\nlegitimacy with regard to the question of Palestine \r\nthrough advocacy and the mobilization of public \r\nopinion, as well as for their initiatives aimed at \r\nalleviating the plight of the Palestinian people. It also \r\nexpresses its intention to develop its cooperation with \r\nparliamentarians and their umbrella organizations. \r\n The Committee requests the Division for \r\nPalestinian Rights to continue its substantive and \r\nsecretariat support; its programme of research, \r\nmonitoring and publications and other informational \r\nactivities, such as the further expansion and \r\ndevelopment of UNISPAL, including the graphic \r\nenhancement of the website on the question of \r\nPalestine; the annual training programme for staff of \r\nthe Palestinian Authority; and the annual observance of \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. \r\n The Committee requests the continuation of the \r\nspecial information programme on the question of \r\nPalestine of the Department of Public Information, \r\nwith the necessary flexibility called for by \r\ndevelopments relevant to the question of Palestine. \r\n Finally, while reiterating its desire to make a \r\ncontribution to the achievement of a comprehensive, \r\njust and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine, \r\nthe Committee calls upon all States to join it in that \r\nendeavour and to extend their cooperation and support \r\nto the Committee. It also again invites the General \r\nAssembly to recognize the importance of the \r\nCommittee’s role and to reconfirm its mandate. \r\n In conclusion, may I express my thanks and \r\nappreciation to the Chairman and the other members of \r\nthe Committee, as well as the officials of the United \r\nNations Division for Palestinian Rights, for the \r\nassistance they have extended to me as Rapporteur of \r\nthe Committee. I would like to express the hope that \r\nthe report I have just introduced will be of assistance \r\nand guidance to the Assembly in its deliberations on \r\nthe question of Palestine. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Riad Malki, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Palestine. \r\n Mr. Malki (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to reiterate Palestine’s \r\npleasure at seeing you, Mr. President, preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly during its sixty-third session. We \r\nreiterate our confidence in your abilities and wisdom in \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 8 \r\n \r\nguiding the Assembly’s efforts to address the important \r\nand critical issues on its agenda. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n We are gathered in the Trusteeship Council \r\nChamber this morning once again to solemnly \r\ncommemorate the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. Our people are filled with deep \r\ngratitude for the outpouring of solidarity, support and \r\nconcern expressed to them on this Day from all corners \r\nof the world. The Day is traditionally observed on \r\n29 November, the date in 1947 when the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 181 (II), which \r\npartitioned historic Palestine into two States — one \r\nArab and one Jewish — and led to the tragedy and \r\ninjustice that befell the Palestinian people with their \r\nuprooting, dispersion, dispossession and loss of their \r\nhomeland in the Nakba of 1948.  \r\n The annual observance of the Day reassures the \r\nPalestinian people of the continuing international \r\ncommitment, especially on the part of the United \r\nNations, to uphold its historic responsibility with \r\nregard to the question of Palestine until it is resolved in \r\nall its aspects, in accordance with international law and \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. That commitment and the \r\nongoing solidarity have helped to strengthen \r\nPalestinian perseverance over the many years of \r\nstruggle against injustice, oppression and occupation \r\non the long road towards the realization of the \r\nPalestinians’ inalienable human rights and national \r\naspirations. Yet, today, as the Palestinian people \r\nsolemnly reflect on the passage of 60 years since the \r\nNakba, they are also filled with grief at the immense \r\nsuffering and losses they have endured, collectively \r\nand individually. Our people are tired and drained from \r\nthe suffering and hardships that they have withstood, \r\nand they are filled with longing for the rights and \r\nfreedom they have for so long been denied, including \r\ntheir rights to self-determination and return. \r\n More than half of the Palestinian people, \r\ncomprised of more than three generations of families, \r\ncontinue to live in exile as refugees. They are dispersed \r\nthroughout the diaspora, with millions still languishing \r\nin refugee camps and denied the right to return to their \r\nhomes to live in peace with their neighbours, and \r\nsuffering innumerable hardships. In the meantime, the \r\nremainder of the Palestinian people, including \r\nrefugees, continue to live under Israeli occupation in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories, including East \r\nJerusalem, and are continually subject to oppression \r\nand the violation of their human rights. \r\n As they reflect on that reality, the Palestinian \r\npeople are filled with sorrow and resentment at the \r\ninjustice, endless humiliation and affronts to their \r\ndignity that they have been forced to endure for so long \r\nbefore the eyes of the world as they have continued to \r\nappeal for their rights. Moreover, they are deeply \r\ndisappointed by the many promises repeatedly made, \r\nyet unfulfilled, to uphold the law and resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy to justly resolve the question \r\nof Palestine and finally bring peace and stability to our \r\nregion. \r\n However, the Palestinian people remain hopeful \r\nand are reassured by the justness of their cause and the \r\ninternational support that has helped to sustain their \r\nsteadfastness over the decades. The political, socio-\r\neconomic, humanitarian and moral support and \r\nassistance that has been extended to the Palestinian \r\npeople from around the world has helped to ease their \r\nsuffering and strengthen their resolve to bring an end to \r\nthe occupation, realize their rights and achieve a \r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace.  \r\n Indeed, despite repeated crises, upheavals and \r\ndisplacement, the Palestinian people have never given \r\nup on their legitimate national aspirations. Under the \r\nleadership of their sole legitimate representative — the \r\nPalestine Liberation Organization — they have \r\nremained determined to achieve justice and to live in \r\npeace and security in their homeland. As embodied in \r\nthe 1988 Palestinian declaration of independence and \r\nas pledged at the Middle East peace process launched \r\nin 1991, they are committed to the two-State solution \r\nas the means of peacefully establishing their \r\nindependent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital, in the Palestinian territory under Israeli \r\noccupation since 1967. \r\n The Palestinian leadership therefore remains \r\ncommitted to the Madrid terms of reference, Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the \r\nprinciple of land for peace. Our leaders have also \r\nstrived to fulfil our obligations under the Quartet’s \r\nRoad Map and have fully endorsed and committed \r\nthemselves to the Arab Peace Initiative. In addition, \r\nour leaders have made every effort to follow up on the \r\njoint understandings agreed at Annapolis.  \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n9 08-61587 \r\n \r\n Moreover, the Palestinian people and their \r\nleadership remain convinced that, as regards the \r\nquestion of Palestine, the international community will \r\nultimately fulfil its responsibilities by upholding \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations \r\nso as to achieve a peaceful settlement that will give our \r\npeople the freedom for which they have waited so long \r\nand allow them to take their rightful place among the \r\nnations of the world, including here in the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n We have therefore returned to the General \r\nAssembly to renew our appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to continue and intensify efforts in support \r\nof the peace process in order to achieve a peaceful and \r\njust settlement of the question of Palestine in all its \r\naspects, including a just solution to the plight of \r\nPalestine refugees on the basis of resolution 194 (III). \r\nIn today’s world, there is no doubt that the question of \r\nPalestine is at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and \r\nthat rectifying the injustice that has been done to the \r\nPalestinian people is fundamental to ensuring peace \r\nand stability in the Middle East. The positive effects of \r\nsuch an accomplishment will no doubt extend beyond \r\nour region, as has been repeatedly asserted for many \r\nyears in numerous debates regarding Palestine.  \r\n In addition, the issue of Palestine has emerged as \r\na central theme in debates concerning other relevant \r\nissues of our time, including at the recent high-level \r\nmeeting on dialogue among religions and cultures. \r\nDuring that meeting, country after country referred to \r\nthe pressing need to resolve the Palestine question, as \r\nit is at the centre of widely held perceptions among \r\nStates regarding the lack of justice, equality and \r\nrespect for human rights in the world and the existing \r\ntensions and sensitivities among religions and between \r\nEast and West.  \r\n In fact, a just and peaceful resolution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine and the closing of this tragic era \r\nwill allow the peoples of the world to truly believe that \r\nthe wrongs of history can be righted and that dialogue \r\nand peaceful negotiation, rather than military force and \r\naggression, are the means to resolve conflict. That will, \r\nin turn, allow us to turn our attention and energies from \r\nconflict to the pursuit of coexistence and the \r\ndevelopment of our societies. The resulting hope and \r\npolitical, social and economic stability and security \r\nwill allow us to make the necessary efforts to lift our \r\npeoples from the suffering caused by armed strife, \r\npoverty and hunger and to harness our true potential. \r\nThat will benefit our people and the international \r\ncommunity as a whole and help us to establish a more \r\nharmonious and prosperous future. \r\n Regrettably, we have not made significant strides \r\ntowards the realization of those goals since we last met \r\nin this Hall to consider the question of Palestine. An \r\nhonest and careful assessment of the current situation \r\nreveals little progress in the peace process since its \r\nresumption a year ago. It also shows a continuing \r\ndeterioration of the situation on the ground in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, as a result of ongoing illegal Israeli policies \r\nand practices. \r\n Even under the aegis of the peace process, Israel, \r\nthe occupying Power, has continued to commit \r\ncountless violations of international law, including \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law, many of which \r\namount to war crimes. Israel continues with impunity \r\nto kill, injure, imprison, displace and collectively \r\npunish Palestinian civilians. It is destroying their \r\nhomes, properties, infrastructure and lands and \r\ncontinues to inflict immense losses and humanitarian \r\nsuffering on our people. At the same time, Israel \r\ncontinues its unlawful colonization campaign, in \r\nparticular by building and expanding settlements and \r\nconstructing the wall in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem. All those efforts are \r\naimed at creating facts on the ground in order to alter \r\nthe territory’s character, status and demographic \r\ncomposition, entrench Israel’s presence on the territory \r\nand advance its expansionist agenda. \r\n For many decades, Israel has relentlessly pursued \r\nthe two-pronged policy of subjugating and oppressing \r\nthe Palestinian people and confiscating and colonizing \r\ntheir land. As time and developments in the situation \r\non the ground have demonstrated, Israel’s deliberate \r\nintent in that regard has been to consolidate its control \r\nover the Palestinian territory it has occupied since 1967 \r\nin order to forcibly acquire, and de facto annex, as \r\nmuch of that land as possible. Israel’s pursuit of that \r\npolicy has entailed establishing a vast web of illegal \r\npractices and crimes and violating every human rights \r\nstandard. That has caused extensive hardships for the \r\nPalestinian people, including widespread socio-\r\neconomic devastation and the fragmentation of the \r\nunity, contiguity and integrity of the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, thereby fuelling the cycle of \r\nviolence and instability and undermining every effort \r\nat peace. \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 10 \r\n \r\n In the past year, Israel’s occupying forces have \r\ncontinued to use excessive and indiscriminate military \r\nforce against Palestinian civilians and their property, in \r\ngrave violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. That \r\nhas resulted in major losses of innocent lives, including \r\nchildren and women, as well as thousands of injuries \r\nand psychological trauma among the population and \r\nthe further destruction of property, homes, agricultural \r\nland and infrastructure.  \r\n Death, injury and property destruction have also \r\ncontinued to be perpetrated by extremist armed Israeli \r\nsettlers who have been illegally transferred to the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory. They continue to carry \r\nout acts of violence, harassment, incitement, \r\nprovocation and terror against Palestinian civilians. \r\nThe situation, which is especially severe in Al-Khalil \r\n(Hebron), is worsening as settler attacks intensify and \r\nthe occupying Power continues to fail to halt their \r\nlawlessness and to hold them accountable for their \r\ncrimes. \r\n In addition, Israel, the occupying Power, has \r\narbitrarily detained and imprisoned approximately \r\n11,000 Palestinian civilians, including women and \r\nchildren. Despite the release of some prisoners in \r\nrecent months, ongoing Israeli raids and arrests have \r\nkept the number of prisoners at a high level. Moreover, \r\nPalestinian prisoners and detainees continue to be \r\nsubjected to physical and mental ill-treatment, abuse, \r\nsolitary confinement and torture. They are denied \r\nfamily visits, adequate medical care and food and are \r\nheld in completely unsanitary and inhumane \r\nconditions. \r\n Israel is also continuing its policy of collective \r\npunishment against the Palestinian people by imposing \r\nclosures and restrictions on the movement of persons \r\nand goods within, into and out of the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, which \r\nhas been virtually cut off from the rest of the territory. \r\nPalestinian access to schools, hospitals, employment, \r\nagricultural land, food supplies, holy places and \r\nhumanitarian assistance, as well as to each other, is \r\nbeing severely obstructed by the complete closure of \r\nthe Gaza Strip and by a labyrinth of more than 630 \r\ncheckpoints and roadblocks in the West Bank — to say \r\nnothing of the settlements, the wall, the bypass roads, \r\nthe permit regime and, in particular, the imposition of \r\nresidency restrictions on Jerusalem residents. All of \r\nthat has had a tragic and catastrophic impact on the \r\nPalestinian economy and the social fabric. \r\n In that regard, Israel’s continuing siege of the \r\nGaza Strip has transformed the area into a huge prison. \r\nThat is the most inhumane form of collective \r\npunishment, and is tantamount to a war crime. That \r\ndeplorable situation has continued despite a ceasefire \r\nbrokered by Egypt in June, which aimed at breaking \r\nthe cycle of violence as well as the blockade. The \r\nsealing of border crossings, the restrictions on the \r\nmovement of persons and goods in Gaza — including \r\nhumanitarian personnel and the import of food, \r\nmedicine and other essential supplies — the complete \r\nprohibition of exports and the cutting off of fuel and \r\nelectricity have increased socio-economic deprivation \r\nin Gaza and deepened the already dire humanitarian \r\ncrisis. Every aspect of life has been disrupted; poverty, \r\nhunger, disease and unemployment are continuing to \r\nincrease, with 80 per cent of Gaza’s civilians now \r\nliving below the poverty line and completely \r\ndependent on food aid to survive. In addition, half of \r\nthe labour force is unemployed and more than 90 per \r\ncent of industry and businesses are closed. \r\n At the same time, Israel is continuing its massive \r\nsettler colonization campaign in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, in grave breach of the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention and its Additional Protocol I. That \r\neffort, also in violation of United Nations resolutions, \r\nshows complete disregard for the 9 July 2004 Advisory \r\nOpinion of the International Court of Justice and flouts \r\nthe commitments made by Israel in the peace process. \r\nThat campaign includes ongoing illegal confiscation of \r\nPalestinian land, the construction and expansion of \r\nsettlements and outposts, the transfer of hundreds of \r\nthousands of Israeli settlers, the construction of the \r\nwall, the establishment of a bypass road system \r\nprohibited to Palestinians and intended to connect the \r\nsettlements to each other and to Israel and numerous \r\nother illegal measures.  \r\n Israel is continuing its intensive settlement \r\nactivities, especially in and around occupied East \r\nJerusalem, where it is expanding settlements and \r\ntransferring settlers. In pursuing its efforts there, Israel \r\ncontinues to demolish Palestinian homes, impose \r\nresidency restrictions and carry out excavations. The \r\npurpose is to alter the city’s demographic composition \r\nand character and to force the “quiet transfer” of \r\nPalestinians and ensure a Jewish majority in the city. \r\n Taken as a whole, the settlements, the wall, the \r\nbypass roads, the checkpoints and other Israeli military \r\ninstallations occupy huge swaths of Palestinian land, \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n11 08-61587 \r\n \r\nincluding areas with water and natural resources that \r\nare daily being exploited and which total \r\napproximately 50 per cent of the West Bank’s occupied \r\nland area. Moreover, that vast settler colonial network \r\nis separating Palestinian communities, especially in \r\nEast Jerusalem, transforming many of them into \r\nwalled-off cantons, thereby causing the displacement \r\nof thousands of civilians. \r\n In addition to the direct humanitarian \r\nconsequences for the Palestinian people, the \r\ncontinuation of Israel’s unlawful colonization \r\ncampaign seriously jeopardizes future prospects for \r\npeace. That campaign is altering the demographic \r\ncomposition, character and status of the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory and is undermining its contiguity, \r\nintegrity and unity. It is the main obstacle to efforts to \r\npolitically and physically achieve the two-State \r\nsolution of Palestine and Israel, living side by side in \r\npeace and security on the basis of the pre-1967 \r\nborders, in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and \r\n1515 (2003), the Arab Peace Initiative and the Road \r\nMap. \r\n All of Israel’s illegal actions must be firmly \r\nrepudiated and condemned. A complete cessation of all \r\nIsraeli settlement activity and human rights violations \r\nis required, both in order to stem the human suffering \r\ncaused by the occupation and to create a more stable \r\nenvironment conducive for peacemaking. It is the \r\ncollective duty of the international community, \r\nincluding the Security Council, to uphold the law, \r\nimplement all relevant United Nations resolutions and \r\nact in unison to compel Israel to abide by its legal \r\nobligations, truly pursue peace with the aim of \r\nachieving the two-State solution and end the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict as well as the entire Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. \r\n The continuation of the current situation is \r\nunacceptable. There can never be peace and security in \r\nthe Middle East as long as the question of Palestine \r\nremains unresolved. Moreover, peace can never be \r\nachieved as long as Israel continues to defy the law, \r\nremains an unwilling or absent partner in the peace \r\nprocess and continues to attempt to impose an \r\nunlawful, unilateral military solution. Only a peaceful \r\nsettlement, including a just solution to the Palestinian \r\nrefugee problem, can bring an end to the conflict and \r\nestablish the peace, stability and security that we all \r\nseek and to which all peoples are entitled. \r\n The Palestinian people and their leadership \r\nremain committed to the peace process on the basis of \r\nthe clear principles of international law and the \r\nresolutions of the United Nations, which serve as the \r\nterms of reference for peace. We urge all concerned \r\nparties, including the Quartet, to seize the historic \r\nopportunities created by the Arab Peace Initiative and \r\nthe Annapolis conference and make every effort \r\nnecessary to help the parties to advance their \r\nnegotiations to bring an end to Israel’s occupation of \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and all \r\nother Arab territories occupied since 1967. We also call \r\nfor their help in realizing the Palestinian people’s \r\ninalienable rights, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination and to their independent State of \r\nPalestine, as well as a just, lasting and comprehensive \r\npeace. \r\n Indeed, at this critical time, it is incumbent upon \r\nthe international community to redouble its efforts to \r\nuphold its legal, political and moral responsibilities to \r\npromote a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict. After 60 long years, during which both \r\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples have lived in conflict, \r\nno effort should be spared to bring an end to this \r\ntragedy and to the suffering and loss on both sides. In \r\nthat regard, we firmly believe in the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of \r\ninternational law. We will continue to seek \r\ninternational support to achieve a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace settlement, in the hope that one \r\nday soon we shall gather here to celebrate the inclusion \r\nof a free and independent Palestine among the family \r\nof nations. \r\n Mr. Hossain (Bangladesh): Let me begin by \r\nthanking the President for scheduling this very \r\nimportant meeting to coincide with the observance of \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. While reaffirming our full solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people and lending our unwavering support \r\nto their legitimate struggle for self-determination, \r\nBangladesh stands firm in its position on the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict in favour of achieving a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. \r\n The delegation of Bangladesh aligns itself with \r\nthe statement that will be made by the representative of \r\nCuba on behalf of Non-Aligned Movement. In addition \r\nto that, we would like to highlight some of the points \r\nthat are of particular concern to us. \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 12 \r\n \r\n The people of Palestine have been under Israel’s \r\nillegal occupation for the past four decades. Their \r\nfundamental rights to self-determination and to \r\nestablish a sovereign State remain unrealized. \r\nBangladesh is deeply concerned over the continued \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people and the deteriorating \r\nhumanitarian situation in the occupied territory. \r\n Israel has continued to violate international \r\nhumanitarian law by committing systematic human \r\nrights violations against the Palestinian people. The \r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territory, including \r\nEast Jerusalem, remains critical. The blockade of the \r\nGaza Strip is yet another example of Israel’s violation \r\nof international humanitarian law. Indiscriminate \r\nclosures enforced by Israel are impeding access on the \r\npart of humanitarian assistance workers to the occupied \r\nterritories, halting commercial activities and causing \r\nthe loss of thousands of jobs. That has brought the \r\neconomy to the verge of irreversible collapse. Not only \r\nhas it restricted access to basic necessities of life, it is \r\nalso destroying the social fabric of the Palestinian \r\npeople by causing widespread displacement. We \r\ndemand the immediate withdrawal of all restrictions on \r\nthe movement of Palestinian civilians. \r\n The continued expansion of Israeli settlements in \r\nthe occupied territories and the construction of the \r\nseparation wall threaten to derail the ongoing peace \r\nnegotiations. With the unabated construction of the \r\nwall, which ignores the advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the occupied territories \r\nare increasingly being fragmented into smaller parts, \r\nwhich will seriously affect the viability of a Palestinian \r\nState. Bangladesh reiterates its call for the immediate \r\ndismantling of the wall. \r\n My delegation would like to draw attention to the \r\nfact that Israel, as a signatory to the relevant provisions \r\nof the Fourth Geneva Convention, which stipulates the \r\nresponsibilities of an occupying Power, cannot, legally \r\nor morally, absolve itself of its responsibilities to \r\nguarantee basic human rights to the people under its \r\noccupation. The General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, in their resolutions adopted over the years, \r\nhave reconfirmed the obligation of Israel to ensure the \r\nbasic human rights of the Palestinian people. \r\nBangladesh believes that only the full and sincere \r\nimplementation of the relevant resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council can resolve \r\nthe Palestinian crisis. \r\n The situation in the occupied territories has \r\nfurther deteriorated during the past year in the face of \r\nrelentless violence, destruction, killing, curfew, \r\nclosures and systematic violations of human rights and \r\nlegal norms by Israeli forces. The concerted Israeli \r\nactions to subdue the resistance of the Palestinian \r\npeople in the form of collective punishment have \r\nbroken all known international humanitarian norms. As \r\nmentioned in the Secretary-General’s latest report \r\n(A/63/368), the situation on the ground in Israel and \r\nthe occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, has \r\nhampered political efforts to achieve the vision of two \r\nStates living side by side in peace and security. \r\n We concur with the Secretary-General’s \r\nobservation that, with the launch of the Annapolis \r\nprocess and regular bilateral negotiations between \r\nIsrael and Palestinians, new hopes for the achievement \r\nof a peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine \r\nhave emerged. Bangladesh is ready to play a supportive \r\nrole in that collective endeavour to achieve a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. But unless \r\nthe two parties join the process in all sincerity and with \r\ngenuine political willingness, the process, like many \r\nother attempts in the past, will only raise some \r\noptimism before unravelling into yet another let-down. \r\n The just and legitimate struggle of the Palestinian \r\npeople for self-determination and freedom from foreign \r\noccupation enjoys the strong support and solidarity of \r\nthe entire international community. We welcome all \r\nrecent regional and international efforts, including the \r\nrevival of the Arab Peace Initiative and the Conference \r\non the Middle East hosted by the United States in \r\nAnnapolis last year. We welcome the commitment to \r\nthe establishment of the Palestinian State and the \r\nagreement to start final status negotiations to resolve \r\nall core issues, including those pertaining to borders, \r\nrefugees, settlements and Jerusalem. In order to be fair, \r\nthose issues must be resolved on the basis of previous \r\nagreements, especially the relevant resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council, the principle \r\nof land for peace, the Madrid Peace Conference terms \r\nof reference, the Quartet’s Road Map and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. That will entail Israel’s complete \r\nwithdrawal from occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem. We are hopeful that a peace \r\ntreaty will be achieved without further delay in the \r\nnear future, and then implemented quickly and \r\nearnestly. Delay and obstruction will only exacerbate \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n13 08-61587 \r\n \r\nthe situation and make the prospects for peace even \r\nbleaker. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report reflects the dire \r\nhumanitarian situation in the occupied territories. The \r\ninternational community must exercise its clout to \r\nensure Israel’s full compliance with its obligations in \r\nall the occupied territories. Israel must also end \r\npolicies and actions that seek to change the reality on \r\nthe ground and that could prejudice a final settlement, \r\nincluding the integrity and viability of the future \r\nPalestinian State. The discussions at Annapolis also \r\nrecognized the crucial importance of addressing all \r\naspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to achieve \r\ncomprehensive peace. We hope to see tangible progress \r\non those parallel tracks, so as to reach a just and \r\ndurable resolution of the conflict. \r\n A lasting and sustainable resolution of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict, including the issue of Palestine, which \r\nis at the core of that long-lasting crisis, must be our \r\ncollective strategic objective. All Member States must \r\npledge complete commitment to that objective and \r\nextend their full moral, diplomatic, political and \r\neconomic support for its early realization. We strongly \r\nbelieve that that would not only help to stabilize other \r\nsimmering situations in the region but also have a \r\nresounding positive impact on regional and \r\ninternational peace and security as a whole. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to underscore that \r\nIsraeli activities in the occupied territories remain a \r\nmatter of grave concern to us. We express our full \r\nsolidarity with the Palestinian people and reiterate our \r\nsteadfast support for their legitimate and inalienable \r\nrights to a sovereign and independent State with \r\nJerusalem as its capital. \r\n Mr. Delacroix (France) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\n(EU). The candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries \r\nof the Stabilization and Association Process and \r\npotential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia; and Ukraine and the Republic \r\nof Moldova align themselves with this statement. \r\n This debate on the situation in the Middle East \r\nand the question of Palestine is being held one year \r\nafter the Annapolis conference, whose outcomes \r\nopened up new prospects for the peace process. The \r\nEU wishes to welcome the commitment of both parties \r\nto finding a solution that, in accordance with the \r\nQuartet’s Road Map, must permit the creation of an \r\nindependent, democratic and viable Palestinian State, \r\nliving in peace and security alongside the State of \r\nIsrael and its other neighbours. \r\n The EU stresses the importance of the negotiation \r\nprocess between the parties initiated at Annapolis, \r\nwhich makes it possible to address all major problems \r\nwithout exception, in accordance with the \r\ncommitments previously agreed between the parties. \r\nThe commencement of the negotiations also renewed \r\nthe involvement of regional and international partners \r\nin the efforts to achieve a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. The EU fully \r\nsupports the ongoing negotiation process and requests \r\nthat the parties maintain a constructive dialogue in \r\norder to find a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict as quickly as possible, based on \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), \r\n1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003), the principle of land for \r\npeace, the Arab Peace Initiative, the Road Map and \r\nprevious agreements between the parties. \r\n In order to consolidate the progress made thus far, \r\nthe parties must make further efforts to honour their \r\nprevious commitments, in particular those set out in the \r\nRoad Map and in the Agreement on Movement and \r\nAccess. In that regard, the EU is particularly concerned \r\nat the settlement activities in and around Jerusalem and \r\nin the remainder of the West Bank. Those activities, \r\nwhich run counter to international law and to Israel’s \r\nRoad Map commitments, must be suspended. They \r\nundermine the credibility of the Annapolis process and \r\naffect the future viability of the Palestinian State. \r\nFurthermore, they make the development of the \r\nPalestinian economy more difficult. The EU also calls \r\non the parties to refrain from any unilateral measure \r\nthat could jeopardize the outcome of the negotiations \r\non a final settlement. \r\n If the peace process is to succeed, it is essential to \r\nput an end to all acts of violence and terrorism between \r\nthe parties. The EU firmly condemns the rocket attacks \r\non Israeli territory carried out by Palestinian militias. \r\nWhile recognizing Israel’s legitimate right to self-\r\ndefence, the EU calls on Israel to exercise the utmost \r\nrestraint and stresses that its actions must in no way be \r\ndisproportionate to or contravene international law. \r\nThe EU condemns in the strongest possible terms the \r\nacts of violence and brutality committed against \r\nPalestinian civilians by Israeli settlers in the West \r\nBank. \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 14 \r\n \r\n The EU commends Egypt’s efforts to overcome \r\ninter-Palestinian divisions and to reunite Palestinians in \r\nthe West Bank and the Gaza Strip under the legitimate \r\nPalestinian Authority. The EU is concerned at the \r\nrecent return of violence in Gaza and southern Israel. \r\nWe call on the parties to respect the calm and hope that \r\nit will lead to increased support for the civilian \r\npopulation of Gaza, including regular opening of the \r\ncrossings for humanitarian or commercial flows, and to \r\na lasting peace on Israel’s southern border. \r\n The EU appeals once again for the immediate \r\nrelease of Corporal Gilad Shalit and would like to \r\ncommend the efforts made to that end, in particular by \r\npartners in the region. We also call for the immediate \r\nrelease of Palestinian ministers and legislators held by \r\nIsrael. \r\n The EU supports the efforts being made in many \r\nareas by the parties within the framework of the \r\nAnnapolis process. In particular, we support the \r\ndevelopment of the Palestinian security sector as a \r\nresult of the efforts of the European Union Police \r\nMission for the Palestinian Territories. The EU also \r\nsupports the economic development of the future \r\nPalestinian State with continued humanitarian and \r\nfinancial assistance, in close cooperation with the \r\nQuartet Representative and the EU Special \r\nRepresentative.  \r\n In that connection, the EU wishes to highlight the \r\nimportance of the donor conference held in Paris on \r\n17 December 2007, which represented vital support for \r\nthe political process initiated in Annapolis. It is now \r\nessential to carefully monitor the outcomes of the \r\nconference in order to ensure that the pledges made in \r\nParis are actually translated into financial assistance. \r\nThe EU thus calls on the donor countries to commit \r\nthemselves as soon as possible to fulfilling those \r\npledges. We also welcome the holding of the \r\nConference in Support of Palestinian Civil Security \r\nand the Rule of Law, held in Berlin on 24 June 2008. \r\n Mrs. Núñez Mordoche (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): On this important occasion, I have the \r\nhonour to address the General Assembly on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). \r\n The International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People is a special opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to reaffirm its support for the \r\nefforts of that heroic people to exercise their \r\ninalienable right to self-determination and to achieve \r\nindependence and freedom. Today, we recall that, for \r\nmore than 60 years, the Palestinian people have \r\nsuffered from statelessness, dispossession and dispersal \r\nin exile, hoping to be able to exercise their right to \r\nreturn to their lands. For more than 40 years, they have \r\nendured a brutal foreign occupation and have been \r\ndenied their inalienable human rights. On this \r\noccasion, we must reaffirm our commitment on the \r\nbasis of the Charter of the United Nations, the norms \r\nand principles of international law and the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, and we must pledge to \r\nredouble our efforts to bring an end to this injustice by \r\nmaking the efforts necessary to resolve the question of \r\nPalestine in all its aspects, including a just resolution \r\nof the plight of Palestine refugees, and to achieve long \r\nsought peace and justice.  \r\n Regrettably, over the past year, the situation in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, has continued to deteriorate and to be \r\ncharacterized by extreme violence, instability and high \r\ntension. The toll in terms of human lives, the injured, \r\nthe displaced, the homeless, the impoverished and \r\nthose lacking access to basic needs in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, particularly in the besieged Gaza \r\nStrip, continues to increase at an alarming rate. The \r\npoverty rate currently stands at 65.8 per cent in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory and at 80 per cent in the \r\nGaza Strip, where the majority of the people depend on \r\nfood aid for survival and nearly 50 per cent are \r\nunemployed. \r\n NAM expresses its great concern at the constant \r\ndeterioration of the situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, \r\nparticularly as a result of the excessive and \r\nindiscriminate use of force by Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, against the Palestinian civilian population and \r\nmany other illegal policies and practices carried out by \r\nIsrael, including its inhumane and destructive measures \r\nof collective punishment against the Palestinian \r\ncivilian population. Those measures by Israel \r\nconstitute grave breaches of international humanitarian \r\nlaw, violate virtually all of the Palestinian people’s \r\nhuman rights and have devastated their socio-economic \r\nconditions, resulting in a dire humanitarian crisis. \r\n In that regard, Israel is continuing to impose \r\nclosures by completely sealing off the Gaza Strip, \r\nthereby obstructing the movement of persons and \r\ngoods such as food, medicine, fuel and other essential \r\nhumanitarian supplies. It is also continuing to impose a \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n15 08-61587 \r\n \r\nhumiliating and discriminatory network of hundreds of \r\ncheckpoints and roadblocks throughout the entire \r\noccupied Palestinian territory. That has resulted in \r\nserious fragmentation and undermined the contiguity \r\nand integrity of the territory, completely isolated East \r\nJerusalem from the rest of the West Bank and caused \r\nsignificant damage to the Palestinian economy and \r\nsociety as a whole.  \r\n Moreover, Israel is continuing to detain and arrest \r\nthousands of Palestinian civilians, who are imprisoned \r\nin inhumane conditions and subjected to all forms of \r\nill-treatment. It is also carrying out intense military \r\nraids and incursions into Palestinian population \r\ncentres. That has led to extensive loss of life and injury \r\nto Palestinian civilians, including children, and the \r\ndeliberate and widespread destruction of property and \r\nland. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement condemns Israel’s \r\nprolonged military occupation of Palestinian territory \r\nsince 1967 and expresses its grave concern over the \r\ndistressing developments and ongoing deterioration of \r\nthe situation in the recent period. For four decades, in \r\nits actions in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, Israel has unrelentingly \r\nviolated international law, international humanitarian \r\nlaw and human rights law. As a result, it has caused \r\nimmense suffering to the Palestinian people and \r\nobstructed all efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace \r\nagreement. \r\n In addition to the illegal practices and measures \r\nto which I have referred, for four decades, Israel has \r\ncarried out deliberate and unlawful policies and \r\npractices aimed at altering the demographic \r\ncomposition, character and nature of Palestinian \r\nterritories and de facto annexing them, in particular \r\nthrough such measures as the confiscation of large \r\nareas of Palestinian land, the implementation of its \r\nillegal colonial settlement policy and, since 2003, its \r\nillegal construction of a wall in the West Bank, \r\nincluding in and around East Jerusalem. Israel \r\ncontinues to pursue those illegal policies and measures \r\nto this day, in total disregard for and in contravention \r\nof international law, including in particular the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention, United Nations resolutions and \r\nthe 9 July 2004 Advisory Opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement expresses its grave \r\nconcern that, even under the peace process, Israel \r\ncontinues and has accelerated its unlawful settlement \r\nactivities in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nespecially in and around East Jerusalem. Moreover, the \r\nMovement is alarmed by the rising incidence of Israeli \r\nsettler violence, harassment and intimidation against \r\nPalestinian civilians, their properties and agricultural \r\nland. We call on the occupying Power to take every \r\nnecessary measure to bring an end to settler violence \r\nand lawlessness and to hold the perpetrators of crimes \r\nagainst Palestinian civilians accountable for their \r\nactions. \r\n NAM condemns all illegal actions by Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, and calls for their immediate \r\ncessation. Israel must cease all settlement activities and \r\nall other illegal policies and practices infringing upon \r\nand violating the human rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople. In addition, NAM believes that such illegal \r\nIsraeli actions, including ongoing military attacks, have \r\nseriously undermined the functioning of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority and have undoubtedly contributed to the \r\ngrowing polarization of Palestinian society. In that \r\nregard, NAM hopes for a speedy restoration of \r\nPalestinian national unity, which is a crucial element to \r\nachieving the legitimate national aspirations and goals \r\nof the Palestinian people. NAM also calls upon all \r\nconcerned parties to make the necessary efforts to \r\npromote reconciliation and unity. \r\n NAM underscores the severity of the situation \r\nfaced by the Palestinian civilian population in the Gaza \r\nStrip as a result of the suffocating siege and closure of \r\nall its crossings by Israel, the occupying Power. Such \r\nunlawful collective punishment against the Palestinian \r\ncivilian population has caused the further deterioration \r\nof socio-economic conditions. That has led to poverty \r\nand hunger and worsened the humanitarian situation to \r\nalarming levels. In that regard, it is incumbent upon the \r\ninternational community to demand that Israel respect \r\nall of its obligations under international law, including \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law, and cease all such \r\nillegal and inhumane practices against the Palestinian \r\ncivilian population of Gaza. \r\n Israel has clear responsibilities as an occupying \r\nPower, from which it must not be absolved. Moreover, \r\nnothing justifies its violation of its obligations and \r\nresponsibilities. Israel must comply with its legal \r\nobligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention, \r\nwhich is applicable to the entire occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem. In that regard, it \r\nmust be emphasized that the Gaza Strip clearly remains \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 16 \r\n \r\npart of the occupied Palestinian territory. NAM \r\ntherefore once again urges Israel, the occupying Power, \r\nto put an end to all serious violations of international \r\nlaw and to fully abide by international humanitarian \r\nlaw, as it is obliged to do as the occupying Power.  \r\n In that regard, NAM demands that Israel open all \r\ncrossings to allow for the movement of persons and \r\ngoods and the unfettered access and movement of \r\nhumanitarian personnel and supplies, including those \r\nof United Nations agencies on the ground. NAM also \r\ndemands that Israel honour its responsibility to repair \r\nall the damage caused to the infrastructure of the Gaza \r\nStrip. \r\n Today, we also urge all States and the \r\ninternational community as a whole to continue to \r\nurgently provide economic and financial assistance to \r\nthe Palestinian people during this critical period in \r\norder to alleviate the current financial and \r\nhumanitarian crisis they continue to experience. \r\n NAM member countries once again call upon the \r\nSecurity Council to assume its responsibilities under \r\nthe Charter, take the necessary actions to implement its \r\nown resolutions and take the necessary steps to compel \r\nIsrael to respect international law and end its \r\noccupation and all illegitimate and illegal practices in \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem. It is unacceptable that the Security Council, \r\nwhose primary responsibility is to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security, continues to fail to \r\ncarry out its permanent responsibility with regard to \r\nthe Palestinian question until it is resolved in all its \r\naspects on the basis of international law. \r\n Israel’s unilateral measures in occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, are a \r\nserious threat to the prospects for achieving a \r\nnegotiated agreement in the form of the two-State \r\nsolution on the basis of the 1967 borders, and \r\nconsequently pose a threat to the prospects for peace. \r\nIn that regard, NAM expresses its concern about the \r\nlittle progress that has been made since the \r\nre-launching of the peace process following the \r\nAnnapolis Conference, in November of 2007, and the \r\nresumption of direct bilateral negotiations between the \r\nIsraeli and Palestinian sides.  \r\n Despite ongoing negotiations and meetings \r\nbetween the two sides, the process continues to be \r\nobstructed and undermined by Israel’s continuing \r\npursuit of illegal policies and practices in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory and its disrespect for the \r\ncommitments it has undertaken in the peace process. \r\nNAM calls upon all concerned parties, including the \r\nQuartet, to make the efforts necessary to promote the \r\npeace process towards the achievement of a just, \r\nlasting and comprehensive peace. \r\n On this occasion, as we gather once again to \r\naddress the question of Palestine more than 60 years \r\nafter the conflict began, NAM reaffirms its support for \r\nthe just cause of the Palestinian people and their efforts \r\nto realize their legitimate national aspirations. NAM \r\nwill continue to support the Palestinian people and its \r\nleadership in order to bring an end to the Israeli \r\noccupation begun in 1967, in accordance with the \r\nnorms and principles of international law and relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. \r\n We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to a just \r\nand peaceful solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nand to the exercise by the Palestinian people of their \r\ninalienable rights, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination and sovereignty in their independent \r\nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital. \r\n Mr. Dwivedi (India): We thank the President of \r\nthe Assembly for convening this discussion on the \r\nquestion of Palestine in the General Assembly today as \r\nwe mark the International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\n There can be little doubt that this issue remains of \r\ngreat concern to the international community. \r\nInstability in that ancient and holy land began with the \r\nquestion of Palestine, and has since impacted upon the \r\nwider situation in the Middle East and upon the entire \r\nworld. As a nation that has had historical and cultural \r\nrelations with all the communities of the Middle East \r\nthrough the millennia and a strong tradition of support \r\nfor a just and mutually acceptable solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine, India has an abiding interest in \r\nthe early resolution of this long-festering problem. The \r\nquestion of Palestine is a matter for which there is \r\nstrong support among all the sectors of society and \r\npolitical parties in India. \r\n Our meeting takes place almost one year after the \r\ninternational conference at Annapolis. We in India \r\nshared the sense of anticipation and hope that earnest \r\nand results-oriented discussions would commence at \r\nthe earliest time possible, aimed at finding the just, \r\nmutually acceptable and durable solution whose \r\ncontours are well-known and hardly need reiteration. \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n17 08-61587 \r\n \r\nWe had also hoped that the process of dialogue would \r\nhelp quickly to address the daily litany of violence, \r\nblockades, rhetoric and privation. \r\n And yet our hopes remain unfulfilled. Settlements \r\ncontinue to expand in the occupied territories, in \r\ncontravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention and \r\nthe Road Map. The separation wall continues to be \r\nbuilt, in derogation of the Advisory Opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The division of Palestinian \r\nterritories endures since the events of June 2007, \r\ndespite efforts to unify the leadership. \r\n Most damagingly, the blockade of Gaza persists. \r\nRestrictions on movement and the enduring blockade \r\nof Gaza have serious humanitarian consequences in an \r\nalready precarious situation. Restrictions on supplies of \r\nfuel and electricity in Gaza have only intensified the \r\nhumanitarian challenge. \r\n The announcement late last week of the \r\nsuspension of humanitarian aid into Gaza as a result of \r\nthe resumption of the blockade was very unfortunate, \r\ntroubling and a cause for great concern. While we, too, \r\nhear reports of some resumption of access for \r\nhumanitarian relief, we call for the lifting of the \r\nblockade to afford full access to Gaza for the supply of \r\nhumanitarian aid and essential commodities. \r\n The security situation also remains a challenge. \r\nDespite efforts to maintain a ceasefire, incidents of \r\nindiscriminate violence and retaliation continue to \r\nerupt, thus perpetuating the cycle of violence. The rise \r\nof incidents of violence by illegal settlers is \r\nparticularly disturbing as it runs the risk of inciting \r\nfurther violence in those highly sensitive locations. In \r\nthis context, India notes with satisfaction the positive \r\nprogress recorded by the Palestinian Authority in \r\nsecuring several towns in the Palestinian territory. \r\n It is important that we retain clarity regarding \r\nfundamentals. India believes that all violence must be \r\neschewed if there is to be a positive atmosphere for any \r\nserious dialogue. However, this is not in itself \r\nadequate. There also needs to be a serious effort to \r\ndismantle the barriers to free movement within the \r\nWest Bank and the blockades around Gaza. \r\n Apart from facilitating the entry of humanitarian \r\nrelief, it is also essential that normal supplies of basic \r\nfacilities, such as power, water and essential \r\ncommodities, be resumed. Citizens of Gaza, like any \r\nother people, also have the right to expect normal \r\naccess to medical facilities. The construction of new \r\nsettlements in the occupied territories and of the \r\nseparation wall must stop forthwith. \r\n A sovereign, viable and independent State of \r\nPalestine, to which the international community is \r\ncommitted through all relevant resolutions, cannot be \r\ncreated under the present circumstances. Our collective \r\ncommitment to resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), \r\n1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003) is devoid of meaning if \r\nwe do not ensure that all parties to the conflict abide by \r\ntheir commitments under the Road Map.  \r\n As the Quartet leads the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to assist the negotiations between \r\nPalestinian and Israeli leaders, we urge the Quartet to \r\ndo much more to ensure that the process progresses in \r\na manner that helps us achieve the desired outcome at \r\nthe earliest. India remains in support of a political \r\nsolution, based on the Road Map and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, which remain the only widely endorsed \r\nframework for an agreement. \r\n While India is not directly involved in supporting \r\nthese negotiations, we have maintained our effort to \r\nhelp avert a larger humanitarian crisis. Last month, \r\nduring President Abbas’s visit to India, our Prime \r\nMinister not only reaffirmed India’s earlier \r\ncommitment of $20 million — $15 million in project \r\nassistance and $5 million in assistance — but also \r\nannounced a grant of $10 million as budgetary support \r\nfor the Palestinian National Authority. An additional \r\nsum of $10 million was announced for project \r\nassistance for Palestinian development programmes. \r\nIndia’s assistance programmes in capacity-building, \r\nand in support for educational programmes were also \r\nexpanded. \r\n This leads us to the larger point: The only lasting \r\nsolution to the question of Palestine is a just, lasting, \r\nmutually acceptable and comprehensive solution, \r\ndrawn up along well-known contours that are set out \r\nand recognized in the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. The ongoing violations of the Road Map \r\nand the persistence of actions that vitiate the \r\natmosphere only make the prospects of an eventual \r\npeace more remote. It remains critical for the parties to \r\nthe conflict and the international community, in \r\nparticular the Quartet, to redouble efforts to settle the \r\nquestion of Palestine in the year ahead. \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 18 \r\n \r\n India reiterates that an early, amicable and \r\nmutually acceptable solution, in accordance with the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly, brooks \r\nno delay. \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): On the \r\noccasion of the International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, allow me to convey the most \r\nheartfelt greetings of the Government and people of \r\nViet Nam to the Government and people of Palestine. \r\n The Vietnamese delegation associates itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of Cuba \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Looking back to a year awash with mixed \r\ndevelopments with regard to the Middle East situation, \r\nmy delegation welcomes the positive signs visible \r\nacross the region, including the continued engagement \r\nof Israel and Palestine in negotiations on final status \r\nissues, guided by the Annapolis process and the Road \r\nMap; the strong support at the international \r\nconferences held in Paris, Bethlehem, London and \r\nBerlin for a viable Palestinian State; and the high-level \r\ndiplomacy initiatives and mediation efforts of the \r\nQuartet, the League of Arab States and regional \r\ncountries. \r\n Along with the tangible progress reached between \r\nIsrael and relevant parties on ceasefires, prisoner \r\nexchange and other areas of mutual concern, further \r\nsteps undertaken by the Palestinian Authority to \r\nenhance national unity, security and the rule of law and \r\nto promote foreign investment and socio-economic \r\ndevelopment reforms deserve our recognition and \r\nencouragement. We share the intense aspiration for the \r\nprocess of peace to prevail despite so much frustration \r\nand despair. \r\n This measured progress, albeit doubly prized in \r\nthe light of the difficult situation of the past two years, \r\ncannot conceal the fact that, more than six decades \r\nafter the General Assembly adopted resolution 181 (II) \r\non the partition plan, and more than four decades after \r\nthe Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967) on \r\nthe Arab-Israel conflict, peace in the Middle East \r\nremains elusive and the Palestinian people continue to \r\nsuffer immensely. \r\n This year, despite the investment of so much \r\nhope, energy and effort in the peace process, we \r\ncontinue to witness a perpetuation of the longest \r\nmilitary occupation in contemporary history, the \r\ncontinued denial and violation of the inalienable rights \r\nof Palestinians, including the right to self-\r\ndetermination and the right of Palestinian refugees to \r\nreturn, and unjustifiable attacks against civilians on all \r\nsides. \r\n Viet Nam shares the concerns of the international \r\ncommunity over Israel’s continued military incursions \r\ninto the West Bank, its expansion of illegal settlements \r\nin the Palestinian territory, its ongoing construction of \r\nthe separation wall, its imposition of closures and \r\nrestrictions on freedom of movement and access to \r\npersons and goods in Gaza, and its continued detention \r\nof thousands of Palestinian prisoners. \r\n In order to further facilitate the ongoing \r\nnegotiations, Israel must put an immediate end to its \r\nrestrictive measures, open border crossings, and ensure \r\nunfettered access for humanitarian assistance to the \r\nPalestinian people in Gaza. We underline the \r\nimportance of the unflagging commitment and \r\ncontributions of the international community, \r\nespecially the United Nations, the League of Arab \r\nStates, the Quartet and regional countries in this \r\nrespect. \r\n Peace processes have never been easy ventures. \r\nThey can be satisfactorily nurtured only as long as the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, diplomatic \r\nnegotiations and dialogue prevail over violence, the \r\nuse of military force and confrontation. The Middle \r\nEast conflict will remain unresolved unless all parties \r\nconcerned go beyond the ordinary in their efforts to \r\nrenounce violence, refrain from any action that might \r\ndestabilize the explosive situation, implement hard-\r\nearned agreements and abide scrupulously by their \r\nreciprocal obligations under the Road Map and \r\ninternational law, particularly human rights and \r\nhumanitarian law. \r\n In conclusion, Viet Nam reaffirms its support for \r\na just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle \r\nEast on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council, including resolutions 242 (1967), \r\n338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003), the Madrid \r\nterms of reference and the principle of land for peace, \r\nas well as the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n Mr. Edrees (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Despite \r\nthe convening of the Annapolis Conference to revive \r\nthe Middle East peace process, new hopes for \r\nachieving a peaceful settlement of the question of \r\nPalestine and realizing the objective of establishing an \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n19 08-61587 \r\n \r\nindependent sovereign and viable Palestinian State \r\nbefore the end of 2008, this objective was not \r\naccomplished, regretfully. The negotiations have not \r\nresulted in any notable progress, while the \r\nhumanitarian conditions of the civilian population in \r\nthe West Bank and the Gaza Strip have continued to \r\ndeteriorate. The progress to which we aspire in \r\nexercising the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople has not been met, because of the illegal \r\npractices by the occupying Power and its constant \r\nrejection of United Nations resolutions. \r\n The General Assembly considered the agenda \r\nitem on the question of Palestine in 2007; the \r\nnegotiating process continues between the Israelis and \r\nthe Palestinians. Yet, Israel, the occupying Power, has \r\nnot ceased its unlawful practices in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including the imposition of \r\ncollective punishment on the civilian population of the \r\nGaza strip, as underscored by the Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs before the Security \r\nCouncil in successive meetings. Moreover, Israel has \r\ncontinued to carry out extrajudicial killings, has used \r\nexcessive and indiscriminate force against Palestinian \r\ncivilians and has expanded its construction of \r\nsettlements, the separation wall, confiscated \r\nPalestinians lands and destroyed their property. All of \r\nthis has prevented the establishment of the necessary \r\nsupportive political environment to achieve the peace \r\nobjective. It has also affected the endeavours of both \r\nparties to reach an agreement on the final status core \r\nissues, including the Road Map and the Annapolis \r\nunderstandings. \r\n Consideration of this agenda item on the question \r\nof Palestine by the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly obtains great importance in re-emphasizing \r\nsupport for the Palestinian people’s endeavours to \r\nrestore their inalienable rights, prominent among which \r\nis the right to self-determination and to establish a \r\nviable, independent, geographically contiguous State of \r\nPalestine, living side by side with Israel, within a clear \r\ntime frame that addresses the crucial six issues of final \r\nstatus negotiations with the same effectiveness, \r\nthrough intensive negotiations between both Israeli and \r\nPalestinian sides, and with the support of the United \r\nNations and other members of the international \r\nQuartet. \r\n Regrettably, as highlighted in the current report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the peaceful settlement of \r\nthe question of Palestine (A/63/368), despite all efforts \r\nmade by the international community to advance the \r\nbilateral negotiations between the Palestinian Authority \r\nand Israel, and notwithstanding the efforts made by the \r\nPalestinian Authority to fulfil its commitments under \r\nthe Road Map, the Israeli side has not honoured its \r\ncommitments. The report also refers to the progress \r\nmade by the Palestinian Authority in imposing law and \r\norder in the West Bank. It emphasizes that Israel has \r\nnot fulfilled its commitments to end its unlawful \r\nsettlement activities and states that Israel has continued \r\nto expand settlements at an unprecedented rate, with \r\nthe purpose of creating a fait accompli on the ground \r\nand annexing large areas of occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory. That has a negative effect on the chances for \r\nsuccessfully carrying out final status negotiations on \r\nsuch issues as the future border of the Palestinian State \r\nand its geographical contiguity and viability. \r\n Similarly, Israel is continuing its construction of \r\nthe separation wall, whose purpose is to bolster its \r\nsettlement policy, in contravention of the advisory \r\nopinion of the International Court of Justice and the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly. That \r\neffort is also part of Israel’s attempts to change the \r\nlegal and demographic character of the West Bank in \r\norder to deviate from the 1967 border with the State of \r\nPalestine, established by the Green Line, and to isolate \r\nEast Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied West \r\nBank. It also shows flagrant disregard for the judicial \r\nand moral content of the Court’s advisory opinion and \r\nis a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention. \r\n That is the current situation in the West Bank. \r\nHowever, the situation in the Gaza Strip is \r\ndeteriorating even further as a result of the suffocating \r\nsiege imposed by the occupying Power, its closure of \r\nborder crossings and its restrictions on movement. \r\nConsequently, there are huge shortages of fuel, food \r\nand medical supplies. Poverty has increased and the \r\nsocio-economic and health conditions of the civilian \r\npopulation have deteriorated. Israel’s most recent \r\nescalation in the Gaza Strip could lead to a resumption \r\nof the horrific vicious cycle of violence and counter-\r\nviolence. Egypt calls for mutual respect of the truce \r\nagreement and for a halt to the firing of rockets and \r\nshells against civilians in Israel and Palestine. \r\nMoreover, Israel should commit itself to halting all \r\nmilitary operations against Palestinian civilians. \r\n The implementation of the Road Map and the \r\nAnnapolis understandings requires that we step up \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 20 \r\n \r\ninternational efforts to achieve agreement on core final \r\nstatus issues. First, both sides must commit to \r\nimplementing several confidence-building measures \r\nunder the supervision of the Quartet and the \r\ninternational community. They must also translate the \r\noutcome of negotiations into reality on the ground, \r\nwith a view to achieving a final, lasting and just \r\nsolution to the question of Palestine based on Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 \r\n(2002) and 1515 (2003), General Assembly resolution \r\n194 (III), the Arab Peace Initiative, the Road Map, the \r\nMadrid terms of reference and the principle of land for \r\npeace. \r\n The success of the peace process requires serious \r\nefforts by the international community to rectify the \r\ncurrent unlawful situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory and to compel Israel, the occupying Power, to \r\nimplement its commitments under the Road Map and \r\nthe relevant provisions of international law. It also \r\nrequires the immediate cessation of all settlement \r\nactivities, the removal of obstacles imposed on \r\nfreedom of access and movement, reopening border \r\ncrossings into the Gaza Strip, including Palestinian \r\ninstitutions in occupied East Jerusalem, and the release \r\nof Palestinian prisoners and officials. The Gaza Strip \r\nmust also continue to receive fuel supplies and \r\ncrossing points should remain open. The contiguity \r\naspired to by the Palestinian people must also be \r\nensured, so as to end the suffocating crisis in Gaza. \r\n In that regard, Egypt continues to support efforts \r\naimed at restoring the inalienable rights of the \r\nPalestinian people and to achieve their legitimate \r\naspiration to establish an independent and viable State \r\non the basis of two States living side by side. The \r\nsolution must also include compensation and the right \r\nof return of refugees, as well as an effort to achieve \r\nPalestinian national reconciliation and the preservation \r\nof the integrity of Palestine’s territory as a single \r\ncontiguous political entity in the West Bank and the \r\nGaza Strip under the leadership of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority. Egypt will continue its efforts to maintain \r\ninternational support until those goals are achieved. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): On behalf of Syria, I would like to express our \r\ndeep gratitude to the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian people and its \r\nChairman, Ambassador Paul Badji, as well as to the \r\nSecretariat’s Division for Palestinian Rights. I would \r\nalso like to express our gratitude to the Department of \r\nPublic Information’s special information programme \r\non the question of Palestine for its contributions to \r\nimplementing resolutions of international legitimacy \r\nrelated to the Palestinian cause, which call for putting \r\nan end to the suffering of a people that has lasted for \r\napproximately 60 years — the Nakba. I should also \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nhis conscientious appeal in his statement at the opening \r\nof this meeting.  \r\n This year’s meeting on the question of Palestine \r\ncoincides with six decades of the Palestinian people’s \r\nNakba and continuous pain and suffering. That has \r\nincluded their forced displacement and eviction from \r\ntheir Palestinian homeland and has prevented refugees \r\nfrom returning to their cities and villages after foreign \r\nsettlers seized their homes. All that took place in \r\nblatant disregard for resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy, international law and human rights law.  \r\n The General Assembly is meeting to debate the \r\nagenda item entitled “Question of Palestine” in order to \r\nreaffirm its support for the Palestinian people in their \r\nstruggle against Israeli occupation and so they can \r\nachieve self-determination and establish their \r\nindependent State on their land and fully regain their \r\nlegitimate rights. Those include the right of refugees to \r\nreturn on the basis of resolution 194 (III) of 1948. \r\nDespite the fact that the United Nations has adopted \r\nhundreds of resolutions calling on Israel to end its \r\noccupation of Arab territories, Israel continues to \r\nrefuse to heed the will of international legitimacy. The \r\nPalestinian people continue to suffer under the yoke of \r\nIsraeli occupation and to be the victims of a policy of \r\nmurder and destruction.  \r\n In the light of this unfortunate dichotomy of \r\nIsrael’s non-compliance with the will of the \r\ninternational community, on the one hand, and the \r\ncontinued suffering of the Palestinian people on the \r\nother, it is critical for the United Nations to uphold its \r\nresponsibilities to the Palestinians in order to find a \r\njust solution to this question. It was, after all, this \r\ninternational Organization that adopted resolution \r\n181 (II); therefore, all Member States bear the \r\nconsequences of the lack of implementation of that \r\nresolution to the present day. The President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly was indeed correct and courageous \r\nwhen he described the United Nations inability to \r\nsecure the establishment of a Palestinian State as the \r\nmost significant failure of this Organization since its \r\ninception. \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n21 08-61587 \r\n \r\n We recall General Assembly resolution 273 (III) \r\nwhich set the conditions for the acceptance of Israel to \r\nmembership in the United Nations. Among the \r\nconditions were Israel’s abidance by the principles of \r\nthe Charter and respect for these principles and for \r\nrelevant resolutions, particularly resolutions 181 (II) \r\nand 194 (III), both of which affirm the right of the \r\nPalestinians to establish a Palestinian State on their \r\nnational soil. These resolutions also establish the right \r\nof return to Palestinian refugees who were forcibly \r\nremoved from their homes. \r\n We must recall that the General Assembly when \r\naccepting Israel’s United Nations membership, duly \r\nnoted Israel’s statements and explanations presented to \r\nthe Special Political Committee at the time as well as \r\nits commitment to implement those two resolutions. \r\nThis commitment, however, was very interestingly \r\nremoved from the framework of Israel’s international \r\naccountability. \r\n The Security Council has taken no serious \r\ndecision on this question because of the objections of a \r\nwell-known permanent member State and because of \r\nthe automatic bias of some other countries in favour of \r\nIsrael’s rejection of its obligations. All of this has sent \r\nthe wrong message from the international community \r\nto Israel, declaring, in fact, that Israel is above the rule \r\nof law. \r\n This year, our meeting is being held while the \r\nentire world is watching the Palestinian people being \r\nsubjected to destruction, killing and displacement that \r\nare unprecedented in contemporary history. All of this \r\nis a result of Israel’s practice of State terrorism against \r\nthe defenceless Palestinian people. \r\n Israel continues to desecrate places of worship \r\nand demolish safe homes. It continues to prevent \r\nmedical supplies, water, food and electricity from \r\nreaching an entire population. Using the pretext of \r\narchaeological interests, it continues to excavate in \r\nareas surrounding places of worship, including the \r\nAl-Aqsa Mosque, Al-Haram al-Sharif and \r\nAl-Maghariba Gate. \r\n Israel continues its policy of collective \r\npunishment and intentional destruction. The most \r\nrecent example is the targeting of the entire \r\ninfrastructure of the Gaza Strip, which is under a \r\nsuffocating siege. Israel has closed border crossings, \r\nthus transforming the Gaza Strip into the largest open-\r\nair prison in the world. \r\n Israel continues to expand its settlements, build \r\nthe racist separation wall, destroy infrastructure and \r\nconfiscate land. It continues to detain and liquidate key \r\npolitical personalities who were democratically elected \r\nby the Palestinian people. Nor has Israel spared the \r\nUnited Nations; Israeli occupation forces continue to \r\ndetain and kill members of the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast and to limit the movement of its staff, inspect its \r\nvehicles and storm its buildings in violation of the \r\nConvention on the Privileges and Immunities of the \r\nUnited Nations of 1946. \r\n At a time when Arab States are seeking to make \r\npeace, Israel is pursuing its policy of annexing land by \r\nintensifying settlement activity in the occupied \r\nterritories and by its continued construction of the \r\nracist separation wall, in blatant violation of the \r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. \r\n Most countries of the world and the United \r\nNations itself, in all its bodies and organs, have \r\nadopted a clear position on Israeli settlement activity, \r\ncondemning and demanding a halt to it. The \r\nintensification of Israeli settlement activity contradicts \r\nthe desire to achieve peace, is a real obstacle to peace, \r\nand only worsens the situation in the region. \r\n Syria reaffirms its continuing support for the \r\nrights of the Palestinian people to regain their occupied \r\nterritories and to establish their independent State, with \r\nJerusalem as its capital. Syria underscores the need to \r\nregain Palestinian national unity through a national \r\ndialogue that would strengthen the Palestinians’ \r\nnegotiating position and bolster the will of the \r\nPalestinian people. Furthermore, Syria is working to \r\nthat end in its capacity as Chair of the Arab summit. \r\n Syria has always believed that a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace can be achieved only through \r\nIsrael’s implementation of the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions, at the forefront of which are Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well \r\nas Council resolution 497 (1981), pertaining to the \r\nSyrian Golan Heights. Syria also calls for a revival of \r\nthe peace process launched at the Madrid Conference \r\nof 1991. \r\n The Arab Peace Initiative, which was endorsed by \r\nthe 2002 Arab Summit in Beirut and reaffirmed by the \r\nArab Summit Conference held this year in Damascus, \r\nreflects the desire of Arabs to achieve a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace and is a sound foundation for the \r\nA/63/PV.57  \r\n \r\n08-61587 22 \r\n \r\nachievement of this peace in a manner that is in line \r\nwith resolutions of international legitimacy. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): Today \r\nas we are discussing agenda item 16 on the question of \r\nPalestine, we are also commemorating the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. \r\n This is an opportunity of particular meaning, \r\nbecause it allows us once again to consider the difficult \r\nsituation endured by the Palestinian people, the deep \r\nsuffering that they experience every day and the denial \r\nof their basic rights. That is why we reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to step up our efforts in order to put an \r\nend to this human tragedy. We also urge all those who \r\ncan bring their influence to bear to step up their efforts \r\nin order to bring about a prompt and appropriate \r\nsettlement of the crisis in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories. \r\n Tunisia would like to express its deep concern \r\nregarding Israel’s continuing settlement activities and \r\nits provocative practices against the Palestinian people. \r\nIn fact, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are \r\nenduring great difficulties owing to the siege imposed \r\nby Israel, which impedes the delivery of basic \r\nhumanitarian assistance and food. This also impedes \r\nthe progress of negotiations and undermines peace and \r\nstability in the region.  \r\n At a time when the international community \r\nhopes to reinvigorate the peace process and \r\nnegotiations, Tunisia is committed to the protection of \r\nrights based on justice and the legitimacy and \r\nprinciples of international law. We have always been a \r\nchampion of the just cause of the Palestinian people. \r\nThis courageous people has always had the full support \r\nof Tunisia, which has stood with the Palestinian people \r\nin their struggle and has always demonstrated that \r\nsolidarity, so the Palestinian people can restore their \r\nlegitimate national rights and establish their \r\nindependent State on their own soil. \r\n My country has spared no opportunity to reaffirm \r\nits ongoing principled support for these policies and \r\nthe President of the Republic, Zine El Abedine Ben Ali, \r\nhas on many occasions expressed that Tunisia would \r\nalways stand with the just Palestinian cause, the cause \r\nof justice and peace in the region and worldwide and a \r\ncause that Tunisia holds most dear. \r\n The responsibility to find a comprehensive, just \r\nand lasting solution to the Palestinian question is a \r\nhistorical and shared responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity, including all its components. Here we will \r\nnot fail to reaffirm our appreciation of the continuous \r\nefforts of the international community and the United \r\nNations to provide the necessary support for the \r\nPalestinian people. I would like, in particular, to \r\nhighlight the action of United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\nand the actions of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.  \r\n It is crucial that we step up our efforts and \r\nprovide all the necessary support to the Palestinian \r\npeople so that we can restore peace in the region. \r\nPresident Ben Ali has stated that Tunisia, based on its \r\ncommitment to peace as a strategic choice and its \r\ntireless commitment to the just Palestinian cause, calls \r\nupon the United Nations to step up its efforts to \r\nimplement the rights of the Palestinian people so that \r\nthat people can live as it deserves in freedom and \r\ndignity. Tunisia reaffirms its commitment to continue \r\nits efforts and to join any actions or any initiatives that \r\nare pursued in order to bring about a just overall \r\nsettlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict and in order to \r\nenable peace and security to reign in the Middle East \r\nregion. \r\n It is necessary to pool all the efforts of the \r\ninternational community in order to put an end to the \r\nsuffering of the brotherly Palestinian people. We also \r\nurge the Quartet and the international community to lay \r\nthe groundwork for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in \r\norder to achieve the peace to which the peoples of the \r\nregion aspire, based on international legality, the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. \r\n Mr. Al Oyaidi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwish to thank the President of the General Assembly \r\nand His Excellency the Secretary-General for the \r\nefforts they are exerting to establish international peace \r\nand security, given the evolving conditions and threats \r\nthat are currently facing the world. The contemporary \r\nissues that we are facing require cooperation among \r\nStates in order to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity in the world, as well as to establish stability. \r\nThe situation also requires the United Nations to play a \r\ndouble role: to ensure the effective and efficient power \r\nof international legitimacy in order to keep the dangers \r\nof war and conflicts at bay, as well as to work to \r\nresolve all issues through peaceful means in \r\n A/63/PV.57\r\n \r\n23 08-61587 \r\n \r\naccordance with the principles of international \r\nlegitimacy. \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated, along \r\nwith other Arab States, at the peace talks held in \r\nMadrid in 1991 and in various other rounds of \r\nmultilateral negotiations, in the hope of ending the \r\nunjust occupation of the Palestinian territories and \r\nother occupied Arab lands. All Arabs look forward to \r\nan end of the Arab-Israeli conflict. However, Israel has \r\nnot implemented any of the agreements, and stability \r\ncontinues to be an unlikely possibility in light of \r\nIsrael’s continued construction of settlements, the \r\nracist separation wall, the confiscation of land, the \r\ndemolition of homes, as well as the practices of \r\ndepriving the Palestinian people of their rights and of \r\npreventing humanitarian access.  \r\n Palestinians are still suffering from violence and \r\nterrorism committed by armed and fanatical Israeli \r\nsettlers. Moreover, Israeli occupation forces continue \r\nto carry out operations aimed at destroying the \r\nPalestinians and their establishments and at further \r\noppressing and torturing them. Furthermore, current \r\nIsraeli practices are aimed at forcing the Palestinians to \r\nsurrender to despair and frustration. \r\n Arabs chose peace, not surrender, and their \r\ndemands remain as follows: implementation of \r\ninternational legitimacy, especially Security Council  \r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the \r\nprinciple of land for peace, as well as a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace. This requires a full Israeli \r\nwithdrawal from the Arab lands occupied in 1967, as \r\nwell as a return of Palestinian refugees to their homes \r\nand the restoration of their rights and compensation for \r\nthose who do not wish to return. Moreover, the \r\nPalestinian people must be allowed to exercise their \r\nright to self-determination and to establish their State \r\non their national soil, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \r\ncapital. There must also be an Israeli withdrawal from \r\nthe Syrian Golan Heights and from the Sheba’a Farms \r\nin South Lebanon.  \r\n The Israeli-Arab struggle is still a dominant \r\nfactor in many of the issues in the Middle East, as it \r\nhas been for the past six decades. It has given rise to \r\nterrorism and extremism and is a basic obstacle for \r\ndevelopment and reform efforts in the area. All Arab \r\nStates have underscored their commitment to a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace based on international \r\nlegitimacy, and these countries are still waiting for a \r\nserious Israeli commitment to that. Partial solutions do \r\nnot support the ongoing negotiations between the two \r\nsides to reach a comprehensive final status solution. \r\nThis requires the Israeli side to immediately halt \r\nsettlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territory. \r\nIsrael’s continued settlement activities only empties \r\nthose negotiations of any meaning.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
