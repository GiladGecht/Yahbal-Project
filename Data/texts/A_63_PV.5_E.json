(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 100 \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/63/1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance \r\nwith the decision taken at its 2nd plenary meeting, on \r\n19 September 2008, the General Assembly will hear a \r\npresentation by the Secretary-General of his annual \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/63/1), under \r\nagenda item 100. I give the floor to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. \r\n The Secretary-General: I welcome all participants \r\nto the opening of the general debate of the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly. It is customary for the \r\nSecretary-General, on this occasion, to assess the state of \r\nthe world and to present our vision for the coming year. \r\n We all recognize the perils of our current moment \r\ntime. We face a global financial crisis, a global energy \r\ncrisis and a global food crisis. Trade talks have \r\ncollapsed yet again. We have seen new outbreaks of \r\nwar and violence and a new rhetoric of confrontation. \r\nClearly, climate change threatens our planet ever more. \r\nWe often say that global problems demand global \r\nsolutions. And yet, today we also face a crisis of a \r\ndifferent sort. Like those others, it knows no borders. It \r\naffects all nations. It complicates all other problems. I \r\nrefer, here, to the challenge of global leadership. \r\n We are on the eve of a great transition. Our world \r\nhas changed more than we may realize. We see new \r\ncentres of power and leadership in Asia, Latin America \r\nand across the newly developed world. The problems \r\nwe face have grown much more complex. In that new \r\nworld, our challenges are increasingly those of \r\ncollaboration, rather than confrontation. Nations can no \r\nlonger protect their interests or advance the well-being \r\nof their peoples without the partnership of other \r\nnations. \r\n Yet, I worry. There is, today, a danger of losing \r\nsight of that new reality. I see a danger of nations \r\nlooking more inward, rather than towards a shared \r\nfuture. I see a danger of retreating from the progress \r\nwe have made, particularly in the realm of \r\ndevelopment and a more equitably sharing of the fruits \r\nof global growth. That is tragic, for at this time one \r\nthing is clear: we must do more, not less. We must do \r\nmore to help our fellow human beings weather the \r\ngathering storm. Yes, global growth has raised billions \r\nof people out of poverty. However, if you are among \r\nthe world’s poor, you have never felt poverty so \r\nsharply. Yes, international law and justice have never \r\nbeen so widely embraced as on this sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. \r\n However, those living in nations where human \r\nrights are abused have never been so vulnerable. Yes, \r\nmost of us live in peace and security. However, we see \r\ndeepening violence in many nations that can least \r\nafford it: Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Congo, Iraq and Sudan, to name but a few. \r\nWe can do something about it, and with strong global \r\nleadership, we will. \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 2 \r\n \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n I would like to speak to you, members of the \r\nAssembly, about the three pillars of development: \r\nhuman rights, peace and security. I say this candidly: \r\nthe situation in the area of development is serious. In \r\nthe course of last year, we watched, with the greatest \r\nconcern, the skyrocketing of fuel prices, foodstuffs and \r\ncommodities. The rich countries fear a recession, while \r\nthe poorest ones no longer have anything to eat. That is \r\nwhy in two days, we shall hold a high-level event on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We must \r\nraise awareness throughout the world and harness \r\nglobal action, with a particular focus on Africa. As you \r\nknow, progress has been uneven. Not all promises have \r\nbeen kept, but we have made enough progress to know \r\nthat achieving the MDGs is within our reach. \r\n At the high-level event, I shall bring together a new \r\ncoalition, made up of Governments, non-governmental \r\norganizations, and leaders of the private sector and \r\nreligious and philanthropic groups. \r\n We know that this is an effective formula. It has \r\nalready worked for malaria, a scourge which kills one \r\nchild every 30 seconds. Last year, I set up a new type \r\nof public-private partnership, which operates on the \r\nbasis of a scientific strategy, marshals funds and is \r\nmanaged centrally at the global level. On Thursday, I \r\nwill announce the results of new research which show \r\nthat this partnership is a resounding success. The \r\nmoment is drawing near when we can declare that \r\nmalaria, one of the last scourges besetting humanity, \r\nhas been eliminated.  \r\n At the present time, we are going to apply this \r\nnew global partnership model to other MDGs. I will \r\nask you, the members of the Assembly, to be both \r\nambitious and specific. I will ask you to indicate what \r\nyou intend to do and how you will do it to help us \r\nachieve our goals by 2015. And I propose that we hold, \r\nin 2010, a summit meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in order to review the follow-up on \r\nthese new commitments. We have to take things in \r\nhand, starting today. We have to respond to this appeal, \r\nwherever we may be. We owe it to the poor of the \r\nEarth. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The United Nations is the champion of the most \r\nvulnerable. When disaster strikes, we act. We did so \r\nthis year in Haiti and other Caribbean nations hit by \r\nhurricanes. We did so in Myanmar after Cyclone \r\nNargis; there, the challenge now is to push for political \r\nprogress, including credible steps on human rights and \r\ndemocracy. We did so in South-East Asia, affected by \r\nsevere flooding, and in the Horn of Africa, afflicted by \r\ndrought, where 17 million need emergency help. \r\n Since taking office, I have called for more \r\nstrenuous action in Somalia. Must we wait and see \r\nmore children die in the sand? We at the United \r\nNations are leaders. We at the United Nations are duty-\r\nbound to do what compassion and human decency \r\ndemand of us.  \r\n The global food crisis has not gone away. It may \r\nhave faded from the daily headlines, but note this fact: \r\nlast year, at this time, rice cost $330 a ton. Today, the \r\nprice is $730. In a single year, the food staple that \r\nfeeds half the world’s population has more than \r\ndoubled in price. People who used to buy rice by the \r\nbag now do so by the handful. Those who ate two \r\nmeals a day now get by on one. The United Nations \r\nhas led the world’s response. Our United Nations High-\r\nLevel Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis \r\nset forth solutions. We focused on getting seeds and \r\nfertilizer into the hands of small farmers. We aim to \r\ncreate a new green revolution in Africa. But the truth is \r\nthat we lack new resources. The international \r\ncommunity has not matched words with deeds. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n We know that peace and security are under attack \r\nfrom all quarters. In countries such as Burundi, Sierra \r\nLeone, Liberia and Timor-Leste, members of \r\npeacekeeping operations, who number more than \r\n100,000, are helping the local population overcome \r\nconflicts and restore peace. We cannot underestimate \r\nwhat the United Nations can accomplish thanks to its \r\ngood offices, especially in the area of preventive \r\ndiplomacy. The results are clear in Nepal and in Kenya, \r\nas well as, I hope, in Zimbabwe. In Cyprus, an island \r\nwhich has been long divided, the chances for \r\nreunification are genuine. In Georgia, the United \r\nNations can help to defuse tension related to the recent \r\nconflict. In Côte d’Ivoire, we will help organize \r\nelections before the end of the year; these will \r\nrepresent an enormous step towards the renewal of \r\ndemocracy. \r\n In Darfur, it remains difficult to meet deployment \r\ntimelines. Crucial equipment and personnel are still not \r\nin place. I would be failing in my obligations if I did \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n3 08-51570 \r\n \r\nnot stress how dangerous it is to act as if the United \r\nNations can settle all of the complex problems of our \r\ntime without enjoying the full support of its Member \r\nStates. Without the necessary resources, mandates are \r\nmeaningless. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The global financial crisis endangers all our \r\nwork: in financing for development, social spending in \r\nrich nations and poor, the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. If ever there were a call to collective action — a \r\ncall for global leadership — it is now. \r\n At the Doha Review Conference later this year, \r\nwe will have an opportunity to address the critical \r\nissues of international economic cooperation and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n I urge all members to engage at the highest level. \r\n We need to restore order to the international \r\nfinancial markets. We need a new understanding on \r\nbusiness ethics and governance, with more compassion \r\nand less uncritical faith in the magic of markets. And \r\nwe must think about how the world economic system \r\nshould evolve to more fully reflect the changing \r\nrealities of our time. \r\n(spoke in French)  \r\n Other problems call for a firm hand on a global \r\nscale. I am thinking in particular of the fight against \r\nmalaria and AIDS, and of reducing maternal and child \r\nmortality. I am thinking of terrorism as well as \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, which are just as \r\nimportant as ever.  \r\n I note the progress that has been achieved in the \r\nSix-Party Talks regarding the Korean peninsula, and I \r\nurge that the agreements be implemented.  \r\n I ask Iran once again to comply with Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and to cooperate fully with the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.  \r\n I am thinking, above all, of human rights. We \r\nmust absolutely bring to life the principle that justice is \r\na pillar of peace, security and development. We have to \r\ngive effect to the responsibility to protect.  \r\n We understand that, in these areas, everything is \r\nnot black and white. We admit that politics can be very \r\ncomplex and that it requires unending compromises. \r\nBut crimes against humanity cannot remain \r\nunpunished. We have the means to combat impunity \r\nand must therefore do so.  \r\n Finally, I am thinking about the crucial problem \r\nof our time: climate change. Last December, in Bali, \r\nworld leaders agreed on a road map for the period up to \r\n2012, when the Kyoto Protocol will cease to guide us. \r\nWe must regain our momentum. The first test will be in \r\nthree months, in Poznan, in Poland. By then, we must \r\narrive at a common idea of the form that a new global \r\nagreement on climate change might take. There are \r\nonly 14 months before Copenhagen. I urge the Polish \r\nand Danish Governments, together with all the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, to deploy all their \r\npersuasive powers at the global level to help us to \r\nmake progress on this literally existential question. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n In closing, let me briefly return to the theme of \r\nmy address to the General Assembly last year — a \r\nstronger United Nations for a better world.  \r\n The foundation of all our work is accountability. \r\nThe United Nations Secretariat, including myself, is \r\naccountable to you, the Member States. And that is \r\nwhy I push so hard and so strongly for United Nations \r\nreform. We need to change the United Nations culture. \r\nWe need to become faster, more flexible, more \r\neffective and more modern.  \r\n In the coming weeks, I will ask the Member \r\nStates to support my proposals for a new human \r\nresources framework. We need to replace our current \r\nsystem of contracts and conditions of service. It is \r\ndysfunctional. It is demoralizing. It discourages \r\nmobility between United Nations departments and the \r\nfield. It promotes stagnation, rather than creativity. It \r\nundercuts our most precious resource — the global, \r\ndedicated corps of international civil servants that is \r\nthe backbone of the United Nations. \r\n Whenever I travel, I go out of my way to meet \r\nthese brave and committed men and women. They \r\nwork in the most difficult circumstances, often at great \r\npersonal sacrifice. I cannot fully express my \r\nadmiration for them. \r\n The time has come to invest more in our staff. \r\nAnd that is why I am promoting mobility matched with \r\nproper career training as a way to create new \r\nprofessional opportunities, in order to inject new \r\nflexibility and dynamism into the Organization. \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 4 \r\n \r\n Finally, let us also remember: you, the Member \r\nStates, are accountable to each other, and to the \r\nOrganization as well. You cannot continue to pass \r\nresolutions mandating ambitious peace operations \r\nwithout the necessary troops, money and materiel. We \r\ncannot send our brave United Nations staff around the \r\nworld — 25 of whom died this year — without doing \r\nall we can to assure their security. We cannot reform \r\nthis vital Organization without providing the required \r\nresources.  \r\n It takes leadership to honour our pledges and our \r\npromises in the face of fiscal constraints and political \r\nopposition. It takes leadership to commit our soldiers \r\nto a cause of peace in faraway places. It takes \r\nleadership to speak out for justice; to act on climate \r\nchange despite powerful voices against one’s \r\nleadership; to stand against protectionism and make \r\ntrade concessions, even in our enlightened self-interest.  \r\n Yet that is why we are here. We have before us a \r\ngreat opportunity. We have ample reason to be \r\noptimistic. Today’s uncertainties will pass. The \r\nchallenges before us are our creation. Therefore we can \r\nsolve them together. By acting wisely and responsibly, \r\nwe will set the stage for a new era of global prosperity \r\nthat is more widely and equitably shared. \r\n I count on your leadership. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his presentation. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): It is a great \r\nhonour for me to address this gathering at the opening \r\nof the general debate of this sixty-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n The international situation at this time is far from \r\nsatisfactory. In fact, the world is in even more serious \r\ntrouble than it was 63 years ago when the United \r\nNations was founded. Right now we are witnessing a \r\nconfluence of large-scale, interrelated crises.  \r\n But crises do not necessarily turn into tragedies. \r\nWe are living in a time of tremendous opportunities to \r\nintroduce corrective measures in order to improve our \r\nway of doing things, of interacting with one another \r\nand with Mother Earth and the natural world in \r\ngeneral. \r\n If we are to seize the opportunities that these \r\ncrises now offer, we must move beyond laments, \r\nspeech-making and statements of good intentions and \r\ntake concrete action based on a firm resolve to replace \r\nthe individualism and selfishness of the dominant \r\nculture and replace it with human solidarity as the \r\ngolden rule that guides our behaviour. \r\n Our Organization has done many laudable things \r\nwhich, had the United Nations not existed, would \r\nsurely not have been achieved. However, if we look at \r\nthe Organization’s progress in fulfilling the primary \r\npurposes for which it was founded, we must admit that \r\nin terms of eliminating war, achieving disarmament \r\nand ensuring international security, we have failed. \r\n In signing the Charter of the United Nations, all \r\nof us undertook to uphold certain principles which, if \r\nthey had truly been upheld by all Member States, \r\nwould have placed the world in a much better position \r\ntoday to meet the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n The world — our world — is ailing, and its \r\nillness is the one that Tolstoy described more than 100 \r\nyears ago as the “mania of selfishness”. Some say that \r\nthis is irreversible — that it is too late to do anything \r\nabout it. I think this attitude is one of dangerous \r\ndefeatism that will only paralyse us and guarantee that \r\nwe keep sinking, until we drown in the morass of \r\nmaniacal, suicidal selfishness in which we find \r\nourselves. \r\n More than half the world’s people languish in \r\nhunger and poverty while at the same time more and \r\nmore money is spent on weapons, wars, luxuries and \r\ntotally superfluous and unnecessary things. We must \r\nresist the temptation to bury our heads in the sand in an \r\nattempt to deny reality. Let us be brave enough to \r\nacknowledge the vast inequities that exist in the world \r\nand within most of our countries, even in many of the \r\nmost developed countries. These inequities are time \r\nbombs that will not simply go away if we ignore them. \r\n In addition to the problem of hunger, poverty and \r\nhigh food prices, there are many other problems whose \r\nhuman origin can no longer be doubted. These include \r\nclimate change, efforts to privatize water and the \r\nsquandering of water as though it were an \r\ninexhaustible resource, the arms build-up, terrorism, \r\nhuman trafficking, the Palestine situation, problems \r\nrelated to humanitarian aid, gender inequality and \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n5 08-51570 \r\n \r\nchildren in especially difficult circumstances such as \r\narmed conflict or humanitarian disaster. \r\n These are the most pressing problems that our \r\nworld faces today. All of them are man-made, and all \r\ncan be traced in large part to the lack of democracy at \r\nthe United Nations. A small group of States takes \r\ndecisions based on selfish motives, and the world’s \r\npoor are the ones who suffer the consequences. \r\n The decisions with the most serious consequences \r\nfor the membership do not go through the General \r\nAssembly. In any event, the resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly — that is, of the representatives of “we the \r\npeoples”, in whose name our Organization was \r\nfounded — are regarded as mere recommendations that \r\nare casually ignored even though they represent the \r\nwishes of 95 per cent of the Organization’s Members. \r\n The current financial crisis, on top of the high \r\ncost of food and the humanitarian devastation caused \r\nby recurrent natural phenomena, will have very serious \r\nconsequences that will impede significant progress — \r\nif indeed any progress is made — towards the targets \r\nestablished in the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhich are themselves insufficient. It is always the poor \r\nwho pay the price for the unbridled greed and \r\nirresponsibility of the powerful. \r\n The world has reached a point at which we have \r\nno alternative: either we love one another or we all \r\nperish; either we treat each other as brothers and sisters \r\nor we witness the beginning of the end of our human \r\nspecies. But if we choose the path of solidarity, \r\nrecognizing each other as brothers and sisters, we will \r\nopen up new horizons of life and hope for everyone. \r\n This is what the peoples of the entire world, \r\nparticularly the dispossessed of the Earth, hope to hear \r\nfrom this distinguished gathering of some 100 heads of \r\nState or Government. They want to hear a universal \r\ncommitment to defending the United Nations, on the \r\nunderstanding that this entails respecting and \r\ndefending the principles on which our Organization is \r\nbased.  \r\n First among them is the principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of all Member States; second is the obligation \r\nof all Members to meet their Charter commitments. \r\nFailure to do so would be not only a serious breach of \r\ninternational commitments; it would amount to an \r\nattack on the United Nations and its ability to work \r\neffectively for peace. \r\n The United Nations has officially proclaimed \r\n2009 the International Year of Reconciliation. Starting \r\ntoday, we must begin to adopt that mindset. We should \r\nemerge from this general debate in a state of \r\nreconciliation, determined to stop treating each other \r\narrogantly and to stop attacking each other. We must \r\nforgive those who might have caused us great pain and \r\nsuffering but who are now pledged to refrain from \r\nattacking us again. \r\n Forgiveness is never a sign of weakness. On the \r\ncontrary, great spiritual strength is needed to forgive \r\nand to refuse to let memories of past abuses become \r\nobstacles to achieving the levels of unity and solidarity \r\nwe need in order to build a new world — in the \r\nconviction that a different world is possible. \r\n In a moment I will have the great honour and \r\nprivilege of inviting all delegations, one by one, to \r\npresent, as representatives of the States Members of \r\nour Organization, their vision of how we should \r\naddress the great challenges of the day and how we can \r\nachieve the unity we need in order to do so effectively. \r\n The first representative on whom, with great \r\npride and pleasure, I shall be calling to take the floor is \r\na very dear friend of many years, President Lula of \r\nBrazil, the largest country in my extended homeland of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. Immediately \r\nafterwards, I shall have the great honour to call on our \r\ndear brother President Bush and to shake his hand. \r\nWhat he has to say to us will be of great importance for \r\nthe world. After that, I shall call on our very dear \r\nbrother President Sarkozy of France, who also \r\ncurrently holds the presidency of the European Union. \r\nNext will come the Presidents of the Philippines, \r\nGabon, Bahrain, Liberia, Turkey, Argentina, \r\nMadagascar and Serbia, as well as the President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, who is currently also \r\nChairperson of the African Union.  \r\n I am sure that the spirit of our great brother and \r\nfriend, the servant of God Julius Nyerere, will be with \r\nus, helping us to attain the noble objectives of this \r\ngeneral debate.  \r\n These introductory remarks are from the heart \r\nand are meant as a kind of fraternal embrace of all \r\nmembers, without any exclusion — to use a phrase of \r\nthe Apostle Paul that has always been a favourite of \r\nmine, in caritate non ficta, “with unfeigned love”.  \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 6 \r\n \r\n Before giving the floor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I should like to remind members that the list \r\nof speakers for the general debate has been established \r\non the agreed basis that statements will have a time \r\nlimit of 15 minutes to enable all speakers to be heard at \r\neach meeting. Within that time frame, I would like to \r\nappeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a \r\nnormal speed so that interpretation in the six official \r\nlanguages of the United Nations can be properly \r\nprovided.  \r\n I should also like to draw the attention of \r\nmembers to the decision taken by the General \r\nAssembly at previous sessions, namely, that the \r\npractice of expressing congratulations within the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall after a speech has been \r\ndelivered is strongly discouraged. In that connection, \r\nafter delivering their statements, speakers are invited to \r\nexit the General Assembly Hall through room GA-200, \r\nlocated behind the podium, before returning to their \r\nseats. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nproceed in the same manner during the general debate \r\nat its sixty-third session? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): Finally, I \r\nshould like to draw the attention of members to the fact \r\nthat, during the general debate, official photographs of \r\nall speakers are taken by the Department of Public \r\nInformation. Members interested in obtaining those \r\nphotographs are requested to contact the Photo Library \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President \r\nof the Federative Republic of Brazil \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil. \r\n Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Luiz Inácio \r\nLula da Silva, President of the Federative Republic of \r\nBrazil, and to invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Da Silva (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): It is my great \r\npleasure to greet my dear friend Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, President of the General Assembly. I wish \r\nyou much success in your mission. \r\n The present session of the General Assembly is \r\nbeing held at a particularly serious time. An often \r\npredicted economic and financial crisis is now today’s \r\nharsh reality. Because of the responsibility of \r\nspeculators, entire peoples are suffering anguish in the \r\nwake of successive financial disasters that threaten the \r\nworld’s economy. Indispensable interventions by State \r\nauthorities have defied market fundamentalists and \r\nshown that this is a time for political decisions. Only \r\ndecisive action by Governments — particularly those \r\nof countries at the epicentre of the crisis — will be able \r\nto rein in the disorder that has spread through the \r\nworld’s financial sector, with perverse effects on the \r\ndaily lives of millions of people. The lack of rules \r\nfavours adventurers and opportunists, to the detriment \r\nof real companies and workers.  \r\n The great Brazilian economist Celso Furtado said \r\nthat we must not always allow speculators’ profits to be \r\nprivatized while their losses are invariably socialized. \r\nWe must not allow the burden of the boundless greed \r\nof a few to be shouldered by all. The economy is too \r\nserious a matter to be left in the hands of speculators. \r\nEthics must also apply to the economy. \r\n A crisis of such magnitude will not be overcome \r\nthrough palliative measures. Mechanisms for both \r\nprevention and control are needed to ensure full \r\ntransparency for international finance. Today’s \r\nsupranational economic institutions have neither the \r\nauthority nor the workable instruments that they need \r\nto control the anarchy of speculation. We must rebuild \r\nthem on entirely new foundations. \r\n The global nature of this crisis means that the \r\nsolutions we adopt must also be global and must be \r\ndecided upon in legitimate and trusted multilateral \r\nforums, without coercion. The United Nations, as the \r\nworld’s largest multilateral arena, must call for a \r\nvigorous response to the weighty threats that we all \r\nface. \r\n Yet there are other, equally serious matters facing \r\nthe world today. One of them is the food crisis, which \r\nafflicts more than a billion human beings. The energy \r\ncrisis is also growing worse every day, as will the risks \r\nto world trade if we fail to achieve an agreement at the \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n7 08-51570 \r\n \r\nDoha Round; another is the unrestrained degradation of \r\nthe environment, which lies behind so many natural \r\ncalamities whose victims are overwhelmingly the poor. \r\n The fall of the Berlin Wall was expected to open \r\nup possibilities for building a world of peace, free from \r\nthe stigmas of the cold war. However, it is sad to see \r\nother walls going up so quickly.  \r\n Many of those who preach the free circulation of \r\ncommodities and capital continue to fight the free \r\nmovement of men and women, using nationalistic and \r\neven racist arguments that evoke unpleasant memories \r\nand fears of times that we thought were behind us.  \r\n A supposedly “populist nationalism”, which some \r\nforces seek to identify and criticize in the South, is \r\nbeing unabashedly promoted in the developed \r\ncountries. The financial, food, energy, environmental \r\nand migration crises, to say nothing of threats to peace \r\nin several regions of the world, reveal that the \r\nmultilateral system must be overhauled to meet the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. \r\n Gradually, countries are moving beyond old \r\nconformist alignments with traditional centres. That \r\nnew attitude, however, does not imply a \r\nconfrontational stance. Simply by using direct dialogue \r\nwithout intermediation by major powers, developing \r\ncountries have stepped into new roles in designing a \r\nmultipolar world, with examples such as India, Brazil \r\nand South Africa (IBSA), the G-20, the summits \r\nbetween South America and Africa and between South \r\nAmerica and the Arab countries and the BRIC \r\ncountries — Brazil, Russian Federation, India and \r\nChina. \r\n A new political, economic and trade geography is \r\nbeing built in today’s world. While navigators in the \r\npast would look to the North Star, today we are trying \r\nto find our way by looking at multiple dimensions of \r\nour planet. Now we often find our North Star in the \r\nSouth. On my continent, the Union of South American \r\nNations (UNASUR) was created last May, as the first \r\ntreaty — after 200 years of independence — that \r\nbrings together all South American countries. This new \r\npolitical union will coordinate the region’s countries in \r\nterms of infrastructure, energy, social policies, \r\ncomplementary production mechanisms, finance and \r\ndefence. \r\n Meeting in Santiago, Chile, just over a week ago, \r\nthe Presidents of South America demonstrated \r\nUNASUR’s ability to respond quickly and effectively \r\nto complex situations, such as the one in our sister \r\nnation, Bolivia. We supported its legitimately-elected \r\nGovernment, its democratic institutions and its \r\nterritorial integrity and we issued a call for dialogue as \r\na path to peace and prosperity for the people of \r\nBolivia. \r\n Next December, in the state of Bahia, Brazil will \r\nhost the first summit of all of the countries of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean on integration and \r\ndevelopment. This will be a high-level meeting under \r\nno umbrella, based on Latin America’s and the \r\nCaribbean’s own perspectives. All these efforts in the \r\nmultilateral sphere are complemented by my country’s \r\nsolidarity initiatives with poorer nations, particularly in \r\nAfrica. \r\n I also wish to emphasize our commitment to \r\nHaiti, where we command troops of the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti and are helping to restore \r\npeace. I reiterate my appeal for the solidarity of \r\ndeveloped countries with Haiti, since implementation \r\nhas fallen far short of the many promises. \r\n The strength of values must prevail over the \r\nvalue of strength. Only legitimate and effective \r\ninstruments can assure collective security. The United \r\nNations has spent 15 years discussing the reform of its \r\nSecurity Council. Today’s structure has been frozen for \r\nsix decades and does not match the challenges of \r\ntoday’s world. Its distorted form of representation \r\nstands between us and the multilateral world to which \r\nwe aspire. Therefore, I am much encouraged by the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s decision to launch negotiations in \r\nthe near future on the reform of the Security Council. \r\n It is multilateralism that must also guide us \r\ntoward solutions to the complex problems of global \r\nwarming, based on the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. Brazil has not shirked its \r\nresponsibilities. Our energy matrix is increasingly \r\nclean. Today’s food and energy crises are deeply \r\nintertwined. The inflation of food prices is affected not \r\nonly by climatic factors and speculation in agricultural \r\ncommodities; it is also driven by rising oil prices \r\nwhich affect the prices of fertilizers and transportation. \r\nAttempts to tie high food prices to the distribution of \r\nbiofuels do not stand up to an objective analysis of \r\nreality. \r\n Brazil’s experience demonstrates — and this \r\ncould be the case for countries similar to ours — that \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 8 \r\n \r\nsugar-cane ethanol and biodiesel production reduce our \r\ndependency on fossil fuels, create jobs, regenerate \r\ndegraded land and are fully compatible with expanding \r\nfood production. We wish to intensify all aspects of \r\nthat discussion at the world conference on energy and \r\nbiofuels which we will be holding in November 2008, \r\nin the city of Sao Paulo. \r\n My obsession with the hunger problem explains \r\nmy ongoing efforts, along with other world leaders, to \r\nreach a positive conclusion to the Doha Round. We are \r\nstill pushing for an agreement to reduce scandalous \r\nfarm subsidies in rich countries. A successful Doha \r\nRound will have a very positive impact on food \r\nproduction, particularly in developing and poor \r\ncountries. \r\n Four years ago, along with several world leaders, \r\nI launched the Action Against Hunger and Poverty here \r\nin New York. Our proposal, then and now, is to adopt \r\ninnovative funding mechanisms. The International \r\nDrug Purchase Facility is one early result of that \r\ninitiative, helping to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria in several African countries. But it is not \r\nenough. We still have a long way to go if we want \r\nhumanity to actually achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n In December 2008, we will commemorate the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, paying a tribute that will go far beyond \r\nmere formalities. That document expresses inalienable \r\ncommitments that challenge us all. As Governments, \r\nwe must do more than support the Declaration with \r\nrhetoric. We are called upon to fight for the values \r\nproclaimed six decades ago and to make them a reality \r\nin each country and around the world. \r\n Today’s Brazil is very different from what it was \r\nin 2003, when I became President of my country and \r\nstood for the first time before the General Assembly. \r\nOur Government and society have taken decisive steps \r\nto transform the lives of Brazilians, creating nearly 10 \r\nmillion formal jobs, distributing income and wealth, \r\nimproving public services, lifting 9 million people out \r\nof extreme poverty, and bringing another 20 million \r\ninto the middle class. All this has occurred in an \r\nenvironment of strong growth, economic stability, \r\nlower external vulnerability and, above all, a stronger \r\ndemocracy with the intense participation of our people. \r\n In the year when we commemorate the \r\none-hundredth birthday of the great Brazilian Josué de \r\nCastro — the first Director-General of the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations and a \r\npioneer in the studies concerning the problem of \r\nhunger in the world — it is worthwhile to reread his \r\nwarning: “It is no longer possible to sit back and let a \r\nregion go hungry without the entire world suffering the \r\nconsequences.” \r\n I am proud to state that Brazil is overcoming \r\nhunger and poverty. I reiterate the optimism that I \r\nexpressed here five years ago. We are much greater \r\nthan the crises that threaten us. We have the heart, the \r\nright-mindedness and the will to overcome any \r\nadversity. More than ever, that is the spirit of \r\nBrazilians. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Federative Republic of Brazil for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. George W. Bush, President of the \r\nUnited States of America \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwith now hear an address by the President of the \r\nUnited States of America. \r\n Mr. George W. Bush, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. George W. \r\nBush, President of the United States of America, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Bush: I am pleased to be here to \r\naddress the General Assembly. Sixty-three years ago, \r\nrepresentatives from around the world gathered in San \r\nFrancisco to complete the founding of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. They met in the shadow of a \r\ndevastating war, with grave new dangers on the \r\nhorizon. They agreed on a historic pledge to reaffirm \r\nfaith in fundamental human rights and unite their \r\nstrength to maintain international peace and security. \r\nThat noble pledge has endured trying hours in United \r\nNations history, and it still guides our work today.  \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n9 08-51570 \r\n \r\n Yet the ideals of the Charter are now facing a \r\nchallenge as serious as any since the United Nations \r\nfounding: a global movement of violent extremists. By \r\ndeliberately murdering the innocent to advance their \r\naims, those extremists defy the fundamental principles \r\nof international order. They show contempt for all who \r\nrespect life and value human dignity. They reject the \r\nwords of the Bible, the Koran, the Torah or any \r\nstandard of conscience of morality. They imperil the \r\nvalues of justice and human rights that gave birth to the \r\nUnited Nations — values that have fuelled an \r\nunprecedented expansion of freedom across the world.  \r\n To uphold the words of the Charter in the face of \r\nthis challenge, every nation in this Hall has \r\nresponsibilities. As sovereign States, we have an \r\nobligation to govern responsibly and solve problems \r\nbefore they spill across borders. We have an obligation \r\nto prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary \r\nfor terrorism, proliferation, human trafficking and \r\norganized crime. We have an obligation to respect the \r\nrights and respond to the needs of our people.  \r\n Multilateral organizations have responsibilities. \r\nFor eight years, the nations in this Assembly have \r\nworked together to confront the extremist threat. We \r\nhave witnessed successes and setbacks, and through it \r\nall a clear lesson has emerged. The United Nations and \r\nother multilateral organizations are needed more \r\nurgently than ever. To be successful, we must be \r\nfocused, resolute and effective.  \r\n Instead of only adopting resolutions decrying \r\nterrorist acts after they occur, we must cooperate more \r\nclosely to keep terrorist attacks from happening in the \r\nfirst place. Instead of treating all forms of Government \r\nas equally tolerable, we must actively challenge the \r\nconditions of tyranny and despair that allow terror and \r\nextremists to thrive. By acting together to meet the \r\nfundamental challenge of our time, we can lead \r\ntowards a world that is more secure, more prosperous \r\nand more hopeful.  \r\n In the decades ahead, the United Nations and \r\nother multilateral organizations must continually \r\nconfront terror. That mission requires clarity of vision. \r\nWe must see the terrorists for what they are: ruthless \r\nextremists who exploit the desperate, subvert the tenets \r\nof a great religion and seek to impose their will on as \r\nmany people as possible. Some suggest that those men \r\nwould pose less of a threat if we would only leave \r\nthem alone, yet their leaders make clear that no \r\nconcession could ever satisfy their ambitions. Bringing \r\nthe terrorists to justice does not create terrorism. It is \r\nthe best way to protect our people.  \r\n Multilateral organizations must respond by taking \r\nan unequivocal moral stand against terrorism. No cause \r\ncan justify the deliberate taking of innocent life, and \r\nthe international community is nearing universal \r\nagreement on this truth. The vast majority of nations in \r\nthis Assembly now agree that tactics like suicide \r\nbombing, hostage-taking and hijacking are never \r\nlegitimate. The Security Council has adopted \r\nresolutions declaring terror unlawful and requiring all \r\nnations to crack down on terrorist financing. Earlier \r\nthis month, the Secretary-General held a conference to \r\nhighlight victims of terror, where he stated that \r\nterrorism can never be justified. \r\n Other multilateral organizations have spoken \r\nclearly as well. The Group of 8 has declared that all \r\nterrorist acts are criminal and must be universally \r\ncondemned. The Secretary-General of the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference recently spoke out against \r\nsuicide bombing, which he said runs counter to the \r\nteachings of Islam.  \r\n The message behind those statements is \r\nresolutely clear. Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has \r\nno place in the modern world. Around the globe, \r\nnations are turning those words into action. Members \r\nof the United Nations are sharing intelligence with one \r\nanother, conducting joint operations and freezing \r\nterrorists’ finances. While terrorists continue to carry \r\nout attacks like the terrible bombing in Islamabad last \r\nweek, our joint actions have spared our citizens from \r\nmany devastating blows.  \r\n The brutal nature of the extremists is increasingly \r\nclear and the coalition of nations confronting terrorists \r\nis growing stronger. Over the past seven years, \r\nAfghanistan and Iraq have been transformed from \r\nregimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that \r\nfight terror. Libya has renounced its support for terror \r\nand its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Nations like Saudi \r\nArabia and Pakistan are actively pursuing the terrorists. \r\nA few nations, regimes like Syria and Iran, continue to \r\nsponsor terror, yet their numbers are growing fewer \r\nand they are growing more isolated from the world.  \r\n As the twenty-first century unfolds, some may be \r\ntempted to assume that the threat has receded. That \r\nwould be comforting. It would be wrong. The terrorists \r\nbelieve time is on their side, so they have made waiting \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 10 \r\n \r\nout civilized nations part of their strategy. We must not \r\nallow them to succeed. The nations of this body must \r\nstand united in the fight against terror. We must \r\ncontinue working to deny the terrorists refuge \r\nanywhere in the world, including ungoverned spaces. \r\nWe must remain vigilant against proliferation by fully \r\nimplementing the terms of resolution 1540 (2004) and \r\nenforcing sanctions against North Korea and Iran. We \r\nmust not relent until our people are safe from this \r\nthreat to civilization. \r\n To uphold the Charter’s promise of peace and \r\nsecurity in the twenty-first century, we must also \r\nconfront the ideology of the terrorists. At its core, the \r\nstruggle against extremists is a battle of ideas. \r\nTerrorists envision a world in which religious freedom \r\nis denied, women are oppressed and all dissent is \r\ncrushed. The nations represented in this Hall must \r\npresent a more hopeful alternative — a vision where \r\npeople can speak freely, worship as they choose and \r\npursue their dreams in liberty.  \r\n Advancing this vision of freedom serves our \r\nhighest ideals, as expressed in the United Nations \r\nCharter’s commitment to the dignity and worth of the \r\nhuman person. Advancing this vision also serves our \r\nsecurity interests. History shows that when citizens \r\nhave a voice in choosing their own leaders, they are \r\nless likely to search for meaning in radical ideologies, \r\nand when Governments respect the rights of their \r\npeople, they are more likely to respect the rights of \r\ntheir neighbours. \r\n For all these reasons, the nations of this body \r\nmust challenge tyranny as vigorously as we challenge \r\nterror. Some question whether people in certain parts of \r\nthe world actually desire freedom. This self-serving \r\ncondescension has been disproved before our eyes. \r\nFrom the voting booths of Afghanistan, Iraq and \r\nLiberia to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Rose \r\nRevolution in Georgia, the Cedar Revolution in \r\nLebanon and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, we \r\nhave seen people consistently make the courageous \r\ndecision to demand their liberty. \r\n For all the suggestions to the contrary, the truth is \r\nthat, whenever and wherever people are given the \r\nchoice, they choose freedom. Nations represented in \r\nthis Hall have supported the efforts of dissidents, \r\nreformers and civil society advocates in newly free \r\nsocieties through the new United Nations Democracy \r\nFund, and we appreciate those efforts. As young \r\ndemocracies around the world continue to make brave \r\nstands for liberty, multilateral organizations like the \r\nUnited Nations must continue to stand with them. \r\n In Afghanistan, a determined people are working \r\nto overcome decades of tyranny and protect their newly \r\nfree society. They have strong support from all 26 \r\nnations of the NATO alliance. I appreciate the United \r\nNations decision this week to renew the mandate of the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. \r\nThe United Nations also has an active civilian presence \r\nin Afghanistan, where experts are doing important \r\nwork helping to improve education, facilitate \r\nhumanitarian aid and protect human rights. We must \r\ncontinue to help the Afghan people defend their young \r\ndemocracy so that the Taliban does not return to power \r\nand Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terror. \r\n In Iraq, the fight has been difficult, yet daily life \r\nhas improved dramatically over the past 20 months \r\nthanks to the courage of the Iraqi people, a determined \r\ncoalition of nations and a surge of American troops. \r\nThe United Nations has provided the mandate for \r\nmultinational forces in Iraq through this December, and \r\nthe United Nations is carrying out an ambitious \r\nstrategy to strengthen Iraq’s democracy, including \r\nhelping Iraqis prepare for their next round of free \r\nelections. Whatever disagreements our nations have \r\nhad on Iraq, we should all welcome this progress \r\ntowards stability and peace and we should stand united \r\nin helping Iraq’s democracy succeed.  \r\n We must stand united in our support of other \r\nyoung democracies, from the people of Lebanon \r\nstruggling to maintain their hard-won independence to \r\nthe people of the Palestinian territories, who deserve a \r\nfree and peaceful State of their own. We must stand \r\nunited in our support of the people of Georgia. The \r\nUnited Nations Charter sets forth the equal rights of \r\nnations large and small; Russia’s invasion of Georgia \r\nwas a violation of those rights. Young democracies \r\naround the world are watching to see how we respond \r\nto this test. The United States has worked with allies in \r\nsuch multilateral institutions as the European Union \r\nand NATO to uphold Georgia’s territorial integrity and \r\nprovide humanitarian relief. Our nations will continue \r\nto support Georgia’s democracy. \r\n In this Hall are representatives of Georgia, \r\nUkraine, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Liberia, Iraq and other \r\nbrave young democracies. We admire their courage, we \r\nhonour their sacrifices, and we thank them for their \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n11 08-51570 \r\n \r\ninspiring example. We will continue to stand with all \r\nwho stand for freedom. This noble goal is worthy of \r\nthe United Nations and it should have the support of \r\nevery member of this Assembly.  \r\n Extending the reach of political freedom is \r\nessential to prevailing in the great struggle of our time, \r\nbut it is not enough. Many in this Hall have answered \r\nthe call to help their brothers and sisters in need by \r\nworking to alleviate hopelessness. Those efforts to \r\nimprove the human condition honour the highest ideals \r\nof this institution. They also advance our security \r\ninterests. The extremists find their most fertile \r\nrecruiting grounds in societies trapped in chaos and \r\ndespair — places where people see no prospect of a \r\nbetter life. In the shadows of hopelessness, radicalism \r\nthrives. Eventually, that radicalism can boil over into \r\nviolence, cross borders and take innocent lives across \r\nthe world.  \r\n Overcoming hopelessness requires addressing its \r\ncauses: poverty, disease and ignorance. Challenging \r\nthese conditions is in the interest of every nation in this \r\nHall, and democracies are particularly well positioned \r\nto carry out that work because we have experience \r\nresponding to the needs of our own people. We are \r\nnatural partners in helping other nations respond to the \r\nneeds of theirs. Together, we must commit our \r\nresources and efforts to advancing education, health \r\nand prosperity.  \r\n Over the years, many nations have made well-\r\nintentioned efforts to promote these goals, but the \r\nsuccess of these efforts must be measured by more than \r\nintentions. It must be measured by results. My nation is \r\nplacing insistence on results at the heart of our foreign \r\nassistance programmes. We launched a new initiative, \r\ncalled the Millennium Challenge Account, which \r\ndirects our help to countries that demonstrate their \r\nability to produce results by governing justly, fighting \r\ncorruption and pursuing market-based economic \r\npolicies, as well as investing in their people. Every \r\ncountry and institution that provides foreign assistance, \r\nincluding the United Nations, will be more effective by \r\nshowing faith in the people of the developing world \r\nand insisting on performance in return for aid.  \r\n Experience also shows that, to be effective, we \r\nmust adopt a model of partnership, not paternalism. \r\nThis approach is based on our conviction that people in \r\nthe developing world have the capacity to improve \r\ntheir own lives and will rise to meet high expectations \r\nif we set them. America sought to apply this model in \r\nour Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Every nation that \r\nreceives American support through this initiative \r\ndevelops its own plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and \r\nmeasures the results.  \r\n So far, these results are inspiring. Five years ago, \r\n50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving \r\ntreatment for HIV/AIDS; today, that number is nearly \r\n1.7 million. We are taking a similar approach to \r\nfighting malaria, and so far we have supported local \r\nefforts to protect more than 25 million Africans. \r\nMultilateral organizations have made bold \r\ncommitments of their own to fight disease. The G-8 \r\nhas pledged to match America’s efforts on malaria and \r\nHIV/AIDS. Through the Global Fund, many countries \r\nare working to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis. Lives in the developing world depend on \r\nthese programmes, and all who have made pledges to \r\nfight disease have an obligation to follow through on \r\ntheir commitments.  \r\n One of the most powerful engines of development \r\nand prosperity are trade and investment, which create \r\nnew opportunities for entrepreneurs, help people rise \r\nout of poverty and reinforce such fundamental values \r\nas transparency and the rule of law. For all these \r\nreasons, many represented in this Hall have conducted \r\nfree-trade agreements at the bilateral and regional \r\nlevels.  \r\n The most effective step of all would be an \r\nagreement that tears down trade barriers at the global \r\nlevel. The recent impasse in the Doha round is \r\ndisappointing, but that does not have to be the final \r\nword. I urge every nation to seize this opportunity to \r\nlift up economies around the world and reach a \r\nsuccessful Doha agreement as soon as possible. \r\nBeyond Doha, our nations must renew our commitment \r\nto open economies and stand firm against economic \r\nisolationism. These objectives are being tested by \r\nturbulence in the global financial markets.  \r\n Our economies are more closely connected than \r\never before, and I know that many of you here are \r\nwatching how the United States Government will \r\naddress the problems in our financial system. In recent \r\nweeks we have taken bold steps to prevent a severe \r\ndisruption of the American economy, which would \r\nhave a devastating effect on other economies around \r\nthe world. We promote stability in the markets by \r\npreventing the disorderly failure of major companies. \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 12 \r\n \r\nThe Federal Reserve has injected urgently needed \r\nliquidity into the system. Last week, I announced \r\ndecisive action by the federal Government to address \r\nthe root cause of much of the instability in our \r\nfinancial markets by purchasing illiquid assets that are \r\nweighing down balance sheets and restricting the flow \r\nof credit. I can assure the Assembly that my \r\nAdministration and our Congress are working together \r\nto quickly pass legislation approving this strategy. And \r\nI am confident that we will act in the urgent time frame \r\nrequired.  \r\n The objectives I have laid out for multilateral \r\ninstitutions confronting terror, opposing tyranny and \r\npromoting effective development are difficult, but they \r\nare necessary tasks. To have maximum impact, \r\nmultilateral institutions must take on challenging \r\nmissions, and like all of us in this Hall they must work \r\ntowards measurable goals, be accountable for their \r\nactions and hold true to their word.  \r\n In the twenty-first century, the world needs a \r\ncompetent and effective United Nations. This unique \r\ninstitution should build on its successes and improve \r\nits performance. Where there is inefficiency and \r\ncorruption, that must be corrected. Where there are \r\nbloated bureaucracies, they must be streamlined. \r\nWhere Members fail to uphold their obligations, there \r\nmust be strong action — for example, there should be \r\nan immediate review of the Human Rights Council, \r\nwhich has routinely protected violators of human \r\nrights. There should be a stronger effort to help the \r\npeople of Burma live free of the repression they have \r\nsuffered for too long. All nations, especially members \r\nof the Security Council, must act decisively to ensure \r\nthat the Government of the Sudan upholds its \r\ncommitment to address the violence in Darfur. \r\n The United Nations is an Organization of \r\nextraordinary potential. As it rebuilds its Headquarters, \r\nit must also open the door to a new age of \r\ntransparency, accountability and seriousness of \r\npurpose. With determination and clear purpose, the \r\nUnited Nations can be a powerful force for good as we \r\nhead into the twenty-first century. It can affirm the \r\ngreat promise of its founding.  \r\n In the final days of the San Francisco Conference, \r\nthe delegates negotiating the United Nations Charter \r\nreceived a visit from President Harry Truman. He \r\nacknowledged the enormous challenges they faced and \r\nsaid that success was possible only because of what he \r\ncalled an unshakable unity of determination. Today, the \r\nworld is engaged in another period of great challenge, \r\nand by continuing to work together, that unshakable \r\nunity of determination will be ours. Together we can \r\nconfront and defeat the evil of terrorism. Together we \r\ncan secure the Almighty’s gift of liberty and justice to \r\nmillions who have not known it. Together we can build \r\na world that is freer, safer and better for the \r\ngenerations who follow. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe United States of America for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. George W. Bush, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the \r\nFrench Republic \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the French \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Nicolas \r\nSarkozy, President of the French Republic, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Sarkozy (spoke in French): I bring \r\nyou fraternal greetings from Europe — Europe that is \r\nconscious of its responsibilities and wishes to act; \r\nEurope that is true to its values — democracy and \r\nfreedom; Europe that is loyal to its friends, but also \r\nEurope that wishes to speak to the whole world in \r\nservice of dialogue and of peace. \r\n At a time when the world is deeply troubled, I \r\nhave come to tell you, on behalf of Europe, that in the \r\nmidst of so many difficulties the international \r\ncommunity has a political and moral responsibility that \r\nwe must shoulder. Let us not forget that if we are \r\ngathered here today, it is because following one of the \r\nmost terrible tragedies that humankind has ever known, \r\nthere were men and women of good will who were \r\ndetermined that in the future no one could ever say, \r\nwhen faced with misfortune: “There is nothing we can \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n13 08-51570 \r\n \r\ndo.” That is why we are here, because those who went \r\nbefore us did not renounce their responsibility. Europe \r\nbelieves that today, our duty is to act and to refuse to \r\nsubmit.  \r\n We can wait no longer. We are beginning to \r\ngauge the tragic consequences of having already \r\nwaited too long. We cannot wait to achieve peace, to \r\nend the tragedy in Darfur. We cannot wait to fight \r\nterrorism, to avert the food crisis that condemns so \r\nmany human beings to die of hunger. We cannot wait \r\nto prepare for the post-petroleum world, to fight global \r\nwarming, to save the oceans, to put an end to monetary, \r\nsocial and ecological dumping. We cannot wait to bring \r\nethics to financial capitalism.  \r\n For too long we have all been resigned to being \r\npowerless. For too long we have retreated before the \r\nneed to give to the globalized world institutions that \r\nwill enable it to be regulated. \r\n The world of the twenty-first century cannot be \r\ngoverned with the institutions of the twentieth century. \r\nWe are a century behind. Let today’s major Powers and \r\nthe Powers of tomorrow unite to shoulder together the \r\nresponsibilities their influence gives them in world \r\naffairs.  \r\n To all those who are hesitant, I wish to say that \r\nenlarging the Security Council and the G-8 is not just a \r\nmatter of fairness, it is also a question of effectiveness. \r\nWe can no longer wait to turn the G-8 into the G14 and \r\nto bring in China, India, South Africa, Mexico and \r\nBrazil. Italy is proposing a major step in that direction \r\nat the next summit, which it will host, and Italy is \r\nright. \r\n Let us act to make our international institutions \r\nmore representative, because if they are more \r\nrepresentative they will be stronger, more effective and \r\nmore respected. A new world is emerging not only \r\nthrough all our successes, but also through all the \r\ncrises besetting the planet. However, we cannot receive \r\nthat new world passively, we must build it. \r\n Let us learn to manage together the most acute \r\ncrises that no one, not even the most powerful among \r\nus, can resolve alone. I am convinced that it is the duty \r\nof the heads of State and Government of the countries \r\nmost directly concerned to meet before the end of the \r\nyear to examine together the lessons of the most \r\nserious financial crisis the world has experienced since \r\nthat of the 1930s. Who would understand it if the \r\nworld’s major economies should fail to take the time to \r\nmeet to discuss what we must do together and the \r\nlessons we must draw from what has happened? \r\n Let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism, in \r\nwhich entire swathes of financial activity are not left to \r\nthe sole judgement of market operators; in which banks \r\ndo their job; which is to finance economic development \r\nrather than to fuel speculation; in which rules of \r\nprudence apply to all and serve to avert and soften \r\nshocks instead of exacerbating them; in which the \r\ncredit agencies are controlled and punished when \r\nnecessary; in which transparency of transactions \r\nreplaces such opacity that today it is difficult to \r\nunderstand what is happening; and in which modes of \r\nremuneration do not drive people to take unreasonable \r\nrisks. It is my duty to say that those who jeopardize \r\npeople’s savings should be punished and at last face up \r\nto their responsibilities. We will succeed in that on the \r\ncondition that we work together. \r\n In our globalized world, the fate of each is linked \r\nto that of all others. The negotiations on climate \r\nchange, begun in Bali, will conclude in Copenhagen \r\nnext year. Whatever our particular interests, we do not \r\nhave the right to fail. \r\n Europe will adopt an unprecedented raft of \r\nmeasures on energy and climate in December. Europe \r\ndoes not wish to teach lessons; it wishes to set an \r\nexample. Europe also wishes to set the example by \r\nacting to bring about peace. It did so in Georgia. It did \r\nso with the Union for the Mediterranean. Because for \r\nover half a century Europe has undertaken to stop the \r\nendless cycle of war, vengeance and hate that has \r\nperiodically taken it to the edge of the precipice, it \r\ndoes not want war. It does not want a war of \r\ncivilizations. It does not want a war of religion. It does \r\nnot want a cold war.  \r\n Europe wants peace, and because it wants peace \r\nit says to Russia that it wants links of solidarity with \r\nthat country, that it wants to build a shared future, and \r\nthat it wants to be Russia’s partner. Why not build a \r\ncontinent-wide common economic space that would \r\nunite Russia and Europe? However, Europe also says \r\nto Russia with the same sincerity that it cannot \r\ncompromise on the principle of the sovereignty and \r\nindependence of States, their territorial integrity or \r\nrespect for international law. Europe’s message to all \r\nStates is that it cannot accept the use of force to settle a \r\ndispute. \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 14 \r\n \r\n Europe says to Iran that it respects that country, \r\nthat Iran has the right to civil nuclear energy and that it \r\nwill explore all avenues of dialogue. However, it says \r\nto Iran with the same sincerity that it cannot accept a \r\nnuclear-armed Iran that would endanger the peace and \r\nstability of the whole region. Nor can Europe \r\ntolerate — and I say this solemnly — Iran calling for \r\nthe destruction of the State of Israel. \r\n Europe says to Israel that it is its friend and that it \r\nwill let no one threaten its existence. Europe says to \r\nIsrael that it will always be at its side in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism, but with the same sincerity says to \r\ntelling Israel that there will be no peace until there is a \r\nviable Palestinian State with recognized borders. \r\n Europe says to Afghanistan that it will continue \r\nto stand by it and that it will not permit barbarians \r\nallied with Al-Qaida again to take an entire people \r\nhostage and to turn an entire country into a terrorist \r\nbase.  \r\n Europe says to Somalia that it will help it, with \r\nthe support of the United Nations, to combat the \r\nscourge of piracy off its coasts. Until all States join \r\ntogether to establish a maritime police force, we cannot \r\nallow some hundreds of pirates to threaten the free \r\npassage of ships throughout the world. \r\n Europe says to Africa that it is committed to \r\nco-development, that it wishes to be Africa’s privileged \r\npartner, and that it has a common destiny with Africa \r\nand a profound sense of solidarity. Europe says to \r\nAfrica that it has its place among the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council and in the enlarged \r\nG-8. How can one ever hope to settle the great issues \r\nof the world while ignoring Africa, South America or a \r\nlarge part of Asia? Europe believes in the African \r\nrenaissance, which is under way and, first and \r\nforemost, is in the hands of the Africans, particularly \r\nthose of African youth, which is the youth of the world. \r\n Essentially, what brings us here together in this \r\nforum, where everyone must listen to the others and \r\nthereby show them a form of respect, is something \r\nmore basic even than democracy. What brings us \r\ntogether is respect for the dignity of all just as they are, \r\nand for diversity of their opinions, cultures and beliefs. \r\nHuman dignity is a universal value. What we must \r\npromote everywhere is respect for that diversity, which \r\nis the surest guarantor of peace and human fraternity \r\nand the surest antidote to intolerance, hatred, violence, \r\nobscurantism and fanaticism. \r\n That is what Europe wants: peoples united in \r\nrespect, understanding and solidarity; peoples united \r\nthroughout the world working together for the great \r\ncommon cause of safeguarding of humanity. Time is at \r\na premium; the world cannot wait. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe French Republic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Philippines \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of the Philippines. \r\n Mrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Philippines, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Gloria \r\nMacapagal-Arroyo, President of the Republic of the \r\nPhilippines, and to invite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Macapagal-Arroyo: The developing \r\nworld is at a tipping point. In the Philippines, we feel \r\nthe pain of high prices of food, fuel and rice. Our \r\npeople pursue the universal dream of a better life for \r\nthemselves and their children: better education, better \r\nhealth care, higher wages, a dignified retirement. We \r\nare proving the value of a new paradigm for \r\nself-reliance through the use of, first, a targeted \r\nstrategy with a set of precise prescriptions to ease our \r\nprice challenges; secondly, food self-sufficiency and \r\nmore energy independence; and thirdly, long-term \r\nreforms. This is a positive example that we wish to \r\nshare with the rest of the world. \r\n Our gains over the past seven years were hard-\r\nearned. We made tough and sometimes painful \r\ndecisions to reset our economy: tax increases, banking \r\nreforms, a crackdown on smugglers and tough fiscal \r\ndiscipline, to name a few. Thankfully, these reforms \r\nhave given us some running room to weather the first \r\nwave of global price shocks that reverberated across \r\nthe world earlier this year. \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n15 08-51570 \r\n \r\n It has not been easy, but Filipinos are tough and \r\nresilient. We have pulled together. We have been able \r\nto draw on additional revenues to provide targeted \r\ninvestments in food and fuel to keep our poor afloat \r\nuntil a better day. But we are also realistic and know \r\nthat we cannot do it alone. We need a strong United \r\nNations as never before. We need rigorous \r\ninternational cooperation as never before. \r\n Economic uncertainty has moved like a tsunami \r\naround the globe, wiping away gains, erasing progress, \r\nnot just here on Manhattan island, but also in the many \r\nislands of the Philippines. Just when we thought the \r\nworst had passed, the light at the end of the tunnel \r\nbecame an oncoming train hurtling forward with new \r\nshocks to the global financial system. The setbacks \r\nfrom these global shocks of the past year — and of the \r\npast weeks — are real and profound. It will take time \r\nand perseverance to put the pieces back together. \r\n To address these global challenges, we must go \r\non building bridges among allies around the globe in \r\norder to bring the rice to where it is needed to feed the \r\npeople, to make investments to create jobs, and to keep \r\nthe peace and maintain stability in the world. \r\n It is therefore timely that the Secretary-General, \r\nBan Ki-moon, has organized this year’s agenda around \r\nthe impact of the global economy on the poor. He \r\ndeserves our highest praise for his quick and decisive \r\naction on the global food crisis. His Comprehensive \r\nFramework for Action, involving the United Nations, \r\ndonor countries, civil society and the private sector, \r\nseeks to achieve food security through the right \r\ncombination of policies, technologies and investments. \r\nThis is a model of the United Nations in action. \r\n Since the volatile global economic situation \r\nbecame apparent many months ago, in the Philippines \r\nwe have increased and stabilized the supply of rice and \r\ndelivered targeted subsidies to the poor. We have \r\nreached out to neighbours such as Viet Nam and others \r\nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and \r\nelsewhere to ensure a stable supply and affordable \r\nprices. We have clamped down on price gouging and \r\ninvested additional billions in planting and agricultural \r\nmodernization. \r\n We have increased our energy independence by \r\n17 per cent through greater use of geothermal energy, \r\nbiofuels and other renewable sources, and we expect to \r\nattain 60 per cent energy independence in two years. \r\nBiofuels have been cited as being a positive factor for \r\nclean energy. At the same time, they have also been \r\ncited as a negative factor that contributes to high food \r\nprices. We are pursuing a policy of using non-food \r\nbiofuel sources planted on land unusable for food \r\nproduction purposes. We see this approach as a way for \r\ncountries to seek a sustainable balance between food \r\nand energy needs.  \r\n For food self-sufficiency, our food baskets are \r\nNorth Luzon in our largest island and the southern \r\nisland of Mindanao. Mindanao has fields of the highest \r\nproductivity, yet also the majority of our poorest \r\nprovinces. It is a sad irony that our food basket has \r\nsome of the highest incidences of hunger in our nation.  \r\n The prime reason is the endless Mindanao \r\nconflict. Our archipelago of 7,000 islands has had its \r\nshare of religious strife, ethnic tension and violence. \r\nFor years, we have worked to achieve peace in \r\nMindanao. Much progress was made until violent \r\nelements within the Moro Islamic Liberation Front \r\n(MILF) decided to take the law into their own hands. \r\nWe will restart the dialogue when the area is secure, \r\nwhen our people are safe and when responsible \r\nelements in the MILF regain control. \r\n There is no alternative to peace. I stand before the \r\nAssembly today to declare loud and clear that we are \r\ncommitted to the process of peace in Mindanao. We \r\ngratefully acknowledge here today the central role of \r\nso many friends and allies, including the United \r\nNations; Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Libya, \r\nMalaysia, Saudi Arabia and others in the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference; Australia, New Zealand, the \r\nUnited States and other bilateral partners supplying \r\nofficial development assistance; and the European \r\nUnion and Sweden. All have played a big role in \r\nadvancing peace and development in Mindanao. \r\n We will refocus the peace talks from an approach \r\nthat is centred on dialogue with rebels to one of \r\nauthentic dialogue with the communities. The context \r\nof our engagement with all armed groups will \r\nsubscribe to the United Nations-recognized principle of \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration. We \r\nmaintain high hopes in interfaith dialogue as a means \r\nof building bridges rather than barriers between \r\ncommunities of different cultures and ethnicity. In \r\nfurtherance of this effort, the Philippines will host the \r\nfirst-ever Special Ministerial Meeting of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement on Interfaith Dialogue and \r\nCooperation for Peace and Development in May next \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 16 \r\n \r\nyear. We will also cooperate with the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. \r\n We are also pleased that the Secretary-General \r\nwill join us in Manila during the second Global Forum \r\non Migration and Development. Our overseas Filipino \r\nworkers are true global pioneers. There is no ship \r\nabroad that does not have a Filipino crew or a nation \r\nthat does not have highly skilled Filipino workers. The \r\nmovement of people from one country to another will \r\nsurely increase as globalization continues to erase \r\nborders. This fact should be recognized as having \r\nimplications for the growth and development of both \r\nsending and receiving countries. \r\n In many troubled places of our world, the United \r\nNations is the last great hope for peace and security. \r\nFor this reason, the Philippines contributes one of the \r\nlargest police contingents to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n Mr. President, your leadership is more vital than \r\never. The Philippines will fully support you as you lead \r\nour General Assembly for the coming year. \r\n In conclusion, there are hundreds of millions of \r\ngood people across this globe who are struggling as \r\nnever before. We must hear their cry for help. It is \r\nwithin the collective power of the leaders at this United \r\nNations General Assembly to fulfil the universal dream \r\nof better education, better health, food on the table and \r\na dignified life. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Philippines for the statement she \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Philippines, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Amir of the State of \r\nQatar. \r\n His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin \r\nKhalifa Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n Sheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): I should like \r\nat the outset to congratulate you, Su, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. I wish you every success in your mission. \r\n I should like also to thank your predecessor, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for all of his efforts in the previous \r\nsession. I should further like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his efforts to promote \r\nand revitalize the role of the United Nations. \r\n I need not remind anyone in this Hall, which \r\nholds such a high-level assembly, that the primary goal \r\nof this Organization and the fundamental purpose of its \r\nCharter is to achieve and maintain world peace. \r\n The human experience replete with hopes and \r\nhorrors reminds us all that world peace can only be \r\nachieved by a conscious, positive act and not through \r\nmere wishful thinking. We have sought to achieve \r\npeace through war in which the powerful tried to \r\nimpose their will, as in the two notorious world wars of \r\nthe twentieth century. \r\n We have sought to find peace through entente \r\nbetween empires, as between Britain and France in \r\n1904. We sought peace through coexistence between \r\nthe United States and the Soviet Union in 1971. In all \r\nthose attempts, either by war or by entente between \r\nPowers, by agreement between empires or by \r\ncoexistence between blocs and doctrines, peace has \r\nremained elusive. \r\n We have all come to realize through those long \r\nand exhausting experiences that achieving peace is a \r\npositive act that means more than just eliminating the \r\nthreat of weapons. While it is true that humanity has \r\nnot suffered a global war in the past 60 years, it is also \r\ntrue that peace in those last six decades has remained \r\nelusive. It has been a peace beset by conflicts on all \r\ncontinents and in all territories. We have also come to \r\nthe conclusion that in a world where barriers of \r\ndistance and time have come to evaporate, achieving \r\npeace means establishing and promoting economic and \r\nsocial justice among peoples. That is what constitutes \r\npositive peace. \r\n If the purposes and principles of the Charter have \r\nestablished the political rights of nations on the basis \r\nof international law, the right of peoples to social \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n17 08-51570 \r\n \r\njustice must be based on the idea of development. In \r\nthe past, the first generation of advocates and \r\nsupporters of national liberation movements demanded \r\nwhat they called “positive neutrality”, believing that \r\nthey could thus distance themselves from the wars of \r\nthe major powers. However, the realities of today’s \r\nworld require a different approach, for peace cannot be \r\nachieved through conflict between powers, agreement \r\nbetween empires, or coexistence among blocs, and not \r\neven through positive neutrality. \r\n The alternative to those three options is our new \r\nchoice, namely positive peace, an era of international \r\nlaw that ensures political rights and an era of \r\ndevelopment offering parallel and equal opportunities \r\nin one world, which cannot go into the future burdened \r\nby the injustices of politics or blinded by the darkness \r\nof underdevelopment. \r\n Qatar is getting ready to host the follow-up \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. My country looks forward to an \r\ninternational cooperation that offers the broadest base \r\npossible for political as well as social peace. We hope \r\nthat participation the conference will be at the highest \r\npossible level. The goal is ambitious and the purpose is \r\nvital for the safety and peace of the one human global \r\nvillage. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar for the statement he has just made. \r\n His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of \r\nthe Republic of Liberia \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia. \r\n Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Ellen Johnson-\r\nSirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, and to \r\ninvite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Johnson-Sirleaf: I am honoured to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Liberia, the second time \r\nI am doing so since I assumed office in 2006.  \r\n I congratulate you, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, and your country, Nicaragua, on your \r\nelection as President of this historic sixty-third session. \r\nThere is no doubt that you will bring your vast \r\nexperience to bear in guiding this session to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion. You can rest assured of the full \r\ncooperation and support of the Liberian delegation. \r\n Let me also seize this opportunity to pay tribute \r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the Republic \r\nof Macedonia, for the exemplary leadership he \r\nprovided this body over the past year. \r\n By the same token, I would like to commend the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\nfarsightedness and wisdom in carrying out his mandate. \r\nThe Liberian people still recall with fondness his visit \r\nto Monrovia earlier this year, when they shared with \r\nhim their respect and appreciation for the United \r\nNations, which has provided exceptional support as a \r\nguarantor of the peace we now enjoy in our country \r\nafter 14 years of war. \r\n In our 161 years as the first independent republic \r\nin Africa, we navigated for nearly a century among the \r\nsharks of racism, colonialism, prejudice, human \r\ndegradation and underdevelopment. We have \r\nexperienced a war that killed nearly 8 per cent and \r\ndisplaced 40 per cent of our population, a war that \r\ndestroyed our underdeveloped economy and inadequate \r\ninfrastructure. Through it all, Liberia has come to \r\nappreciate the United Nations as a truly fundamental, \r\nrelevant and important forum and instrument for world \r\npeace. \r\n In its 63 years of existence, the United Nations \r\nhas expanded in scope, form and content. It is, \r\ncorrectly, still primarily concerned with the promotion \r\nof international peace and security. On the basis of our \r\nexperience as a founding Member, Liberia is \r\ncommitted to contributing to the redefinition of that \r\ninternational peace and security that it is very strongly \r\nlinked to and demands the promotion of economic \r\ngrowth and sustained development, particularly food \r\nsecurity, relief from the debt burden, globalization and \r\nfair trade. \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 18 \r\n \r\n We believe in a peace and security environment \r\nthat combats HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases \r\nand that promotes poverty eradication and human \r\nrights, especially the rights of women and children. We \r\nbelieve in the fight against international terrorism, \r\ndrugs and other international crime, and we believe in \r\ndisarmament, especially the elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons and the control of small arms and light \r\nweapons. \r\n The history and experience of Liberia have taught \r\nus to have faith in the United Nations, which today \r\nmaintains nearly 11,000 men and women from all over \r\nthe world helping our country consolidate its newly \r\nwon peace. We wish to thank the Security Council, \r\nwhich has correctly seen the necessity to renew the \r\nmandate of the United Nations Mission in Liberia \r\n(UNMIL). We particularly thank the resource-\r\ncontributing countries, for, without them, we would \r\nnever be able to save the lives we are saving and \r\npromote the development we are promoting. \r\n Our history and experience have taught us to \r\nbelieve in regional peace and security and cooperation. \r\nLiberians still say, with passion: “Thank God for \r\nECOMOG” — the Monitoring Group of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) — \r\nreferring to the period of our war when young men and \r\nwomen from ECOWAS countries, led by Nigeria and \r\nincluding Senegal, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali \r\nand Benin, laid down their lives to save our country. \r\nSubsequently, a Nigerian-led military mission, the \r\nECOWAS Mission in Liberia. provided the beachhead \r\nfor the establishment of UNMIL. We shall always be \r\ngrateful to ECOWAS, which is now dedicating itself to \r\nits prime objective of economic integration and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We also believe in our subregional entity, the \r\nMano River Union, which comprises the countries of \r\nLiberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and now, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, which joined us earlier this year. The Mano \r\nRiver basin, as is well known, had been the epicentre \r\nof the conflict system in West Africa since 1990. As the \r\ncurrent Chair of the Union, I can say on behalf of my \r\ncolleagues that the countries of that basin have \r\ndeclared never again to war and all forms of armed \r\nviolence. The Mano River Union will henceforth be a \r\nnet exporter of peace and all the dividends that come \r\nwith peace in West Africa. \r\n I am proud to say that Liberian history and \r\nexperience have taught us never to shirk in our \r\nopposition to wars and the causes thereof, to man’s \r\ninhumanity to man, to oppression, racism, human \r\nrights abuses, especially those against women and \r\nchildren, and abuses inflicted on the basis of race, \r\ncreed and religion. \r\n In doing so, we know that we may at times not be \r\nseen as following the party line, be it in Africa or on \r\nAfrican issues, or the positions of some close allies. \r\nWe continue to ask our friends to realize that we will \r\nbe guided by our principles, history and experience to \r\nact in the best interest of our people and of the greater \r\nworld community. \r\n It is in this connection that we took a stand on the \r\nsituation in Zimbabwe, because we had faith that the \r\nleaders of that wonderful and great country needed to \r\nknow that fairness in elections and justice in political \r\nparticipation were the best ways to ensure durable \r\npeace. My Government wishes to thank the \r\nZimbabwean leaders and their people for choosing the \r\npath of negotiation for the comprehensive agreement \r\nthat has now been reached. We thank the leaders of the \r\nSouthern African Development Community — \r\nespecially South African President Thabo Mbeki, for \r\nhis role in facilitating the peace deal. May all \r\nZimbabweans work to ensure full implementation of \r\nthe agreement. \r\n Over the past year, Africa has registered \r\nunprecedented economic growth and has experienced \r\nrelative peace in many hitherto-turbulent regions and \r\ncountries. Unfortunately, people in Somalia, in parts of \r\nthe Sudan — especially the Darfur region — Chad, \r\nNiger, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other \r\ncountries have yet to breathe the air of relief and peace. \r\nThey need the concerted efforts and support of the \r\nUnited Nations for the African Union and subregional \r\nbodies to take the actions necessary for peace. Where \r\nthere is evidence of non-cooperation and even \r\naggression against peace forces, the world must move \r\ninto gear under Chapter VII of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n As we have seen in Liberia and throughout the \r\nworld, armed conflicts are exacerbated by easy access \r\nto small arms and light weapons. Thus, as part of the \r\nefforts for durable peace in conflict zones, we must put \r\nin place rigid measures to ensure effective control of \r\nsuch weapons. In that connection, my Government \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n19 08-51570 \r\n \r\nsupports an arms trade treaty. We continue to champion \r\nthe call for total and complete nuclear disarmament in \r\norder to prevent the world from annihilating itself. \r\n Those fears are not unfounded if we imagine such \r\nweapons in the hands of a terrorist. But the threat of \r\nterrorism — the senseless destruction of innocent lives \r\nand property — oftentimes even defies the \r\nimagination. The world must unite to fight that \r\nscourge. No nation or person is protected against it. \r\nThose who feel angry enough to carry out such \r\ndastardly acts defeat their own purposes because they \r\nend up killing those who may be ready to let the world \r\nhear about their causes. They actually end up losing \r\neverything. We grieve with those who lost their loved \r\nones during the terror attacks in Pakistan even while \r\nthe world was meeting here. \r\n While some plot evil deeds, there are those who \r\nare committed to working with Liberia and Africa and \r\nthe rest of Africa to fight poverty and to promote \r\npositive, all-around international cooperation. We are \r\ngrateful for the many avenues for cooperation that have \r\nbeen provided. We thank the United States for its \r\nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, which aims to \r\npromote trade rather than aid; we thank the European \r\nUnion for its Everything but Arms facility; we are \r\ngrateful for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation; \r\nwe thank the Japanese Government and its partners for \r\nleading the Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment; and we thank others to whom the \r\ncontinent is looking for new avenues for sustained \r\ndevelopment. We are pleased to note that our \r\ncooperation efforts have included intra-Africa and \r\nSouth-South endeavours, with great successes having \r\nbeen achieved so far. \r\n Beyond Africa, my Government believes, with \r\ngreat interest, that a durable solution can be found to \r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflict. Late \r\nlast year, I had the opportunity to visit and hold talks \r\nwith Israeli and Palestinian leaders alike in Tel Aviv \r\nand Ramallah. I gathered from conversations and \r\nreports regarding other sustained efforts in search of \r\npeace that the solution of two States, with secure and \r\nrecognizable borders and mutual recognition of each \r\nother, is the way forward. We must never give up \r\nworking for a formal end to the conflict and for a \r\ndurable peace for all in the region. \r\n I should now like to report briefly on Liberia, the \r\ncountry for which, we dare say, the United Nations is \r\nmost likely to receive its best-ever performance record. \r\nOn 19 September 2006, approximately eight months \r\nafter I had assumed the presidency of Liberia as the \r\nfirst woman to have been so elected in Africa, I \r\naddressed this body, laying out my vision for a country \r\nthat had suffered near-total devastation — a country \r\nthat was the best example of a State that had nearly \r\ncollapsed. At that time, I said that Liberia was back, \r\nmoving forward on an irreversible path of peace and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Today, I have come to renew that pledge. I have \r\ncome to report how much progress has been made in \r\nthe light of what we inherited. It should be \r\nremembered that we inherited a situation in which \r\nnearly two thirds of Liberians lived below the poverty \r\nline, with an even higher poverty rate in rural areas. \r\nThe economy collapsed, with gross domestic product \r\nfalling 90 per cent from 1987 to 1995 — one of the \r\nlargest economic free-falls ever recorded in the world. \r\nIndicators in the areas of health, education, water, \r\nsanitation, food security and infrastructure were very \r\npoor and sometimes beyond measure. \r\n My Government, with the support of international \r\npartners, began to take steps to move the whole \r\ncountry into gear. There was a need, first, for clear \r\ndirection in the form of a national vision or agenda, \r\nformulated and contributed to by the people as their \r\nown; secondly, to restore the international reputation \r\nand creditworthiness of the country; and thirdly, to \r\ndemonstrate the necessary leadership — strong, \r\ncommitted and focused — for the people. \r\n The Government, in collaboration with civil \r\nsociety, undertook broad consultations with people in \r\nall parts of the country. That resulted in a framework \r\nfor reducing poverty and making progress towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Our poverty reduction \r\nstrategy for the period 2008-2011 is now in place, \r\nanchored on the pillars of consolidating peace and \r\nsecurity, revitalizing the economy, strengthening \r\ngovernance and the rule of law, and rebuilding \r\ninfrastructure and delivering basic services. \r\n Clearly, those three years are not enough time to \r\naccomplish the daunting tasks laid out in our poverty \r\nreduction strategy; they are part of a process aimed at \r\nlong-term development that will continue far beyond \r\n2011. They are part of a process that must identify \r\neffective responses to the food and energy crises and to \r\nthe as-yet-undetermined effects of climate change. \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 20 \r\n \r\nHowever, the Liberian people are gaining confidence in \r\nthe strategy, for they are seeing that our national \r\nsecurity policy, supported by the United Nations, is \r\nnow producing the desired results.  \r\n They also know that, starting at a low base, we \r\nsaw growth of more than 9 per cent in 2007. Roads and \r\nbuildings are sprouting up in many places; health \r\nclinics are reopening or being established where they \r\ndid not exist before; agricultural production is \r\nincreasing; and a huge external debt is well on the way \r\nto being cancelled, with exceptional support from our \r\npartners. \r\n We believe that that is truly a success story for a \r\ncountry emerging from so much destruction in so short \r\na period of time. But we owe it first to our people — \r\nthe Liberian people — and, very strategically and \r\nimportantly, to the international community, led by the \r\nUnited Nations. The presence of the United Nations \r\nMission in Liberia has given hope to the people that \r\nthey need not surrender to the threat to peace and \r\ndevelopment represented by the large percentage of \r\nunemployed youth who cannot be absorbed by an \r\neconomy that is still too weak, despite its high level of \r\ngrowth. \r\n I come from a continent where female \r\nleadership — particularly a female head of State or \r\nGovernment — is still unthinkable in some quarters. I \r\nhave only a handful of female colleagues at the global \r\nlevel. To help sensitize and energize the world with \r\nregard to the reality of female leadership, my friend \r\nand colleague Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of Finland, \r\nand I are organizing an international colloquium on \r\nwomen’s empowerment, leadership and development \r\nthat will be held on International Women’s Day in \r\nMarch 2009 in Monrovia. I believe that this will \r\nprovide us with the opportunity to make special efforts \r\nin support of women who are desirous to seek elective \r\npublic office and to encourage other women to seek \r\nsuch office. \r\n Mr. Golding (Jamaica), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n As I conclude, let me thank the President for the \r\ngreat work he and his colleagues are doing for a world \r\nmeant for succeeding generations. Let me also say \r\nunequivocally that not only is Liberia back, but we are \r\nlifted and we are blessed. We thank all who have \r\ncontributed to this progress. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Liberia for the statement she has just made. \r\n Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nTurkey. \r\n Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of the Republic of \r\nTurkey, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of \r\nthe Republic of Turkey, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Gül: At the outset, I wish to extend our \r\nsincere congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I would also like to \r\ntake the opportunity to pay tribute to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, for his able leadership during his \r\npast term. \r\n For Turkey, the United Nations Charter reflects \r\nthe common aspirations and conscience of humanity. \r\nThe United Nations provides a political and moral \r\ncompass for our endeavours towards a just \r\ninternational order — a better order that will prevent \r\nnew conflicts, ensure that human rights are upheld and \r\nlead to more equitable and sustainable distribution of \r\nprosperity. \r\n In this framework, we believe that the most \r\npressing task before the international community is to \r\nbridge, as quickly as possible, the enormous gap \r\nbetween the wealthiest and the least fortunate. We have \r\ncertainly made considerable progress in that direction, \r\nincluding towards meeting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals; however, our common fight \r\nagainst poverty, illiteracy, epidemic diseases, child \r\nmortality and climate change is still far from over. On \r\nthe contrary, volatile fuel prices, the food crisis and the \r\nglobal economic slowdown have brought about an even \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n21 08-51570 \r\n \r\nmore challenging development and security \r\nenvironment. Under such circumstances, the fight \r\nagainst terrorism, racism, xenophobia and all forms of \r\nreligious discrimination and extremism takes on \r\nparticular importance. \r\n We must indeed remain extremely vigilant \r\nagainst the risk of further alienation between different \r\ncultures and religions. In that respect, we regard the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations initiative, which we \r\ncosponsored with Spain under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General, as an important \r\ninstrument that can help us avoid such a dangerous \r\ntrack. \r\n Turkey will continue to be a leading country in \r\nfurther advancing the goals of this initiative which \r\nenjoys worldwide backing, including from the \r\nEuropean Union and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. We hope that the Group of Friends of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, which now consists of \r\n14 international organizations and 76 countries \r\nrepresenting different regions ranging from Latin \r\nAmerica to Africa and Asia, will keep growing. In this \r\nvein, we look forward to hosting the second Forum \r\nmeeting of the Alliance of Civilizations in Istanbul \r\nnext April. \r\n As I said, a top priority issue on our agenda is the \r\nneed to address the problems of the developing world. \r\nThere is no question that developing countries should \r\nget all the assistance they need to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. They must be supported under a renewed \r\nglobal development agenda and through increased \r\nforeign investments and enhanced trade facilities. For \r\nits part, Turkey is trying to contribute to this \r\nendeavour, first and foremost through increased \r\ndevelopment assistance. Turkey also provides special \r\nfacilities for development, health, education and \r\nagricultural projects in various parts of the world. As a \r\nresult of such fast-growing aid programmes, Turkey is \r\nnow recognized as an emerging donor country by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The United Nations Ministerial Conference of the \r\nLeast Developed Countries which Turkey hosted in \r\nIstanbul last year has clearly demonstrated our \r\ncommitment to humanitarian and development \r\nassistance. We have now offered to host the Fourth \r\nMinisterial Conference. Similarly, the first-ever \r\nTurkey-Africa Cooperation Summit held in Istanbul \r\nlast month provided an important opportunity to \r\nexplore new avenues of cooperation with the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n Turkey is also committed to combating global \r\nwarming, which has serious implications for the entire \r\nworld, but more so for the developing countries. \r\nDriven by that conviction, we are taking active part in \r\nnegotiations to shape our new global climate change \r\nagreement, which will replace the Kyoto Protocol. \r\n Turkey also pays special attention to the global \r\nwater crisis. In that regard, we hope that the Fifth \r\nWorld Water Forum which we will host in Istanbul next \r\nMarch will inspire new thinking and concrete action on \r\nthis important question. \r\n If I may now turn to the political issues besetting \r\nour region, I am pleased to note that Turkey has been \r\nactively contributing to the advancement of peace by \r\nfacilitating dialogue. We have also been working hard \r\nto build a sense of co-ownership of regional issues \r\namong our neighbours through a series of regional \r\ncooperation initiatives. Encouraged by its strong \r\nregional ties, Turkey has launched another initiative \r\ndesigned to prevent further conflict in the recently \r\ntraumatized South Caucasus. In that regard, I believe \r\nthat the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform \r\nproposed by Turkey could be an instrumental \r\nframework for building a climate of confidence in the \r\nregion that will allow discussion of our common \r\nproblems in a democratic setting. \r\n In the light of impressions from my visits to our \r\nneighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan and those of Prime \r\nMinister Erdoğan to the Russian Federation and \r\nGeorgia, all parties concerned seem receptive to the \r\nidea; we hope they will give it a chance to work. I \r\nsincerely believe that a positive perspective thus \r\ncreated will help to solve frozen conflicts, including \r\noccupied Nagorno-Karabakh, on the basis of respect \r\nfor the principle of territorial integrity. No doubt, such \r\na perspective will also help improve the bilateral ties \r\nbetween the countries of the region.  \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n It is also well past time to settle the conflicts of \r\nthe Middle East, at the core of which lies the \r\nPalestinian question. Turkey actively supports all \r\nendeavours to bring about a lasting solution to that \r\ncentral problem and alleviate the plight of the \r\nPalestinian people. Turkey is also making every effort \r\nto help advance the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. One \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 22 \r\n \r\nrecent example is the indirect peace talks that Syria \r\nand Israel started under Turkey’s auspices this past \r\nMay in Istanbul.  \r\n In Iraq, too, Turkey stands firmly with the Iraqi \r\npeople and Government. Besides our bilateral efforts, I \r\nam particularly pleased to see that the Neighbouring \r\nCountries process, which I initiated five years ago, is \r\nfunctioning well. If the international community’s \r\nefforts are to succeed, the Iraqi people need to settle \r\ntheir differences through dialogue and compromise on \r\ncontroversial issues, among them the final status of \r\nKirkuk.  \r\n Afghanistan is another country where Turkey is \r\ninvesting heavily in the future of a nation with which \r\nwe have special historical ties. Turkey will continue to \r\ncontribute to the security of the Afghan people and to \r\ntheir reconstruction efforts. We will also continue our \r\ninitiatives to create an atmosphere conducive to \r\nregional ownership and cooperation, in particular \r\nbetween Pakistan and Afghanistan. That is equally vital \r\nfor the common struggle against terrorism and for the \r\nstability of the region.  \r\n Finally, an urgent and peaceful settlement of the \r\nquestion of Iran’s nuclear programme, in conformity \r\nwith International Atomic Energy Agency norms and \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nobligations and respecting the right to the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy, remains high on Turkey’s active \r\ndiplomatic agenda.  \r\n I am convinced that would-be solutions to \r\nindividual conflicts in the Middle East will be \r\nsustainable only if we adopt a comprehensive approach \r\nbased on a positive vision for the future. That is why I \r\ninvite all the parties to give serious consideration to the \r\nlongstanding idea of collective arrangements for \r\nconflict prevention and resolution that would promote \r\nregional security and stability by building confidence, \r\nfacilitating political dialogue and encouraging \r\neconomic and cultural cooperation in the Middle East.  \r\n Turkey gives full backing to diplomatic efforts \r\ntowards a political settlement in Cyprus. The solution \r\nlies in the establishment of a new partnership State \r\ncomposed of two constituent States of equal status. The \r\nprocess towards that goal should be based on the \r\nUnited Nations parameters of bi-zonality and the \r\npolitical equality of the two sides. We welcome and \r\nfirmly support the comprehensive settlement \r\nnegotiations recently started between the two leaders \r\nunder the good offices of the Secretary-General.  \r\n At the same time, I believe that efforts to end the \r\nunfair isolation of the Turkish Cypriots who voted \r\ncourageously in favour of the Comprehensive \r\nSettlement of the Cyprus Problem in 2004 — a plan \r\nthat was unfortunately rejected by the other side — are \r\nlong overdue.  \r\n Before concluding, I would like to stress the \r\nindispensable nature of the United Nations in resolving \r\nall those matters. Indeed, without an effective and \r\nfunctional world body, it is impossible to realize the \r\nhopes and expectations of our nations. That is why we \r\nattach the utmost importance to reforming and further \r\nstrengthening the United Nations system as a whole. It \r\nis also why Turkey is constantly stepping up its \r\nengagement in and contributions to all aspects of the \r\nUnited Nations agenda, ranging from development and \r\npeacekeeping to human rights.  \r\n It is also with that sense of responsibility that \r\nTurkey has decided to put forth its candidature for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2009 \r\nand 2010. Turkey has not been represented in the \r\nCouncil for nearly half a century, and we believe that \r\nthe main tenets of our foreign policy, together with our \r\neconomic, social and cultural attributes, will allow us \r\nto bring added value to the work of the Council. I hope \r\nthat the General Assembly, with its valuable support, \r\nwill do us the honour of granting Turkey the \r\nopportunity to do so.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Turkey for the statement he has just \r\nmade.  \r\n Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of the Republic of \r\nTurkey, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, \r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic.  \r\nMs. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, President \r\nof the Argentine Republic, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.  \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n23 08-51570 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Cristina \r\nFernández de Kirchner, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, and to invite her to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Fernández de Kirchner (spoke in \r\nSpanish): As the first female head of State in the \r\nhistory of my country, I would like to address this \r\nAssembly by speaking first on the issue of human \r\nrights. Members know that, for my country, the policy \r\nof unrestricted respect for and promotion of human \r\nrights is one of our State policies.  \r\n In that context, I would like to urge that the \r\nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearance — which was so \r\nenergetically promoted by our country and which I  \r\nco-signed, as First Lady of the Argentine Republic, in \r\nParis last year together with 73 other delegations — be \r\nratified by all countries that have signed it. Thus far, \r\nonly four countries — Argentina, Albania, Mexico and \r\nHonduras — have ratified it. I know that the Republic \r\nof France will soon be ratifying it, but it is \r\nindispensable that we all strongly commit to ensuring \r\nthat the inviolability of persons be one of the guiding \r\nprinciples for all States.  \r\n In this context, I would also like to put forward \r\nthe Latin American Initiative for the Identification of \r\nDisappeared Persons. I would like to say that, together \r\nwith the Guatemalan Foundation for Forensic \r\nAnthropology, the Argentine Forensic Anthropology \r\nTeam and the Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team, \r\nwe are promoting this initiative to establish genetic \r\nidentity banks to enable us to report precisely on \r\nviolations of human rights and properly identify \r\nvictims.  \r\n We deem invaluable the testimony of the women \r\nwho are with us here at the Assembly today, members \r\nof Las Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo — the Grandmothers \r\nof the Plaza de Mayo — who envisioned the creation \r\nof this genetic information bank. They have been able \r\nto recover, from oblivion and disappearance, 95 of the \r\n500 grandchildren who disappeared, children of those \r\npolitical prisoners who disappeared under the former \r\ndictatorship in Argentina.  \r\n The work of these women is living witness to \r\nhow, even amidst adversity and against all that State \r\nterrorism — not just in my country but in other \r\nrepublics — has meant, it is possible to overcome \r\ndeath and fight for life. The recovery of these children \r\nshows how important — how crucial — it is to support \r\nthis type of initiative and underlines the importance of \r\nthe work that has been done to identify the victims of \r\nthe Balkan wars and those of the 11 September attack \r\non the World Trade Center.  \r\n In the fight against impunity, which is a State \r\npolicy in the Republic of Argentina, we cannot fail to \r\nmention an issue that, for us, is undoubtedly another \r\ncornerstone of this inexhaustible struggle. My country, \r\nthe Republic of Argentina, suffered two attacks, in \r\n1992 and 1994: the 1992 bombing of the Israeli \r\nEmbassy and the 1994 bombing of the Argentine \r\nIsraelite Mutual Association (AMIA) building.  \r\n Last year, before this very Assembly, former \r\nPresident Kirchner asked INTERPOL to ratify the \r\narrest warrants issued by my country’s Ministry of \r\nJustice against Iranian citizens accused of participating \r\nin the AMIA building bombing. Days later, INTERPOL \r\nratified them, and international arrest warrants were \r\nissued accordingly. I call upon the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, in compliance with international law, please to \r\nagree that the Argentine justice system can bring to \r\ntrial in public, transparent courts, and with the full \r\nguarantees given by a democratic system, those \r\ncitizens who stand accused.  \r\n Before all the countries of the world brought \r\ntogether in this Assembly, and with the conviction I \r\nhave always held that innocence must be respected \r\nuntil an individual has been convicted and sentenced \r\nby a competent judge, I would like to affirm that, in my \r\ncountry, those citizens will have a fair and public trial \r\nwith their full participation, with all the guarantees \r\nafforded by Argentine law and by the oversight of the \r\ninternational community. Given the gravity of these \r\nevents, this would guarantee to the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran that there would be fairness, truth and justice in \r\nthat trial. \r\n I would thus urge once again that, in compliance \r\nwith international law and because ensuring access to \r\njustice is what truly shows how we respect truth, \r\njustice and freedom, this request from the Argentine \r\njustice system, accepted by INTERPOL, be respected. \r\nThat would undoubtedly contribute to providing truth \r\nfor all — not just for Argentines, but for the entire \r\ninternational community — at a time when truth and \r\njustice are elusive values internationally.  \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 24 \r\n \r\n In this Hall, as we have been doing since 2003, I \r\nwould also like to call for the reform of our \r\nmultilateral bodies — not only of the United Nations, \r\nwhich includes us all, but also of the multilateral \r\nfinancial institutions as well. That involves us all, and \r\nit is necessary to recreate a multilateralism which has \r\nbeen lost, leading to a far more insecure world. The \r\nOrganization needs to be reformed, not just from the \r\npoint of view of dogmatic approaches to the world, but \r\nto meet the real need of all States to ensure the \r\nfunctional, operational and results-oriented character of \r\nthe activities and interventions of the Organization. \r\n In this context, I would modestly like to put \r\nforward an example from our region, South America, \r\nof how we were recently able to demonstrate that \r\nmultilateralism can be achieved, despite differences of \r\napproach and vision that different Governments in our \r\nregion may have.  \r\n Here I am looking at the President Evo Morales — \r\nthe legitimate President of our sister Republic of \r\nBolivia. I would like to say that, a few days ago, the \r\nUnion of South American Nations (UNASUR) met in \r\nsupport of the democratic legitimacy of that country. In \r\na concrete multilateral exercise, heads of State, who do \r\nnot always share the same viewpoints or interests when \r\nwe take decisions, were able to work unanimously to \r\nforge a resolution and plan of action to help our sister \r\nRepublic of Bolivia, affected by those who do not \r\nrespect the democratic will of the people freely \r\nexpressed through elections.  \r\n That is not our only experience of \r\nmultilateralism. Previously, at the meeting of the Rio \r\nGroup in the Dominican Republic, at the time of the \r\nincident between the sister Republics of Ecuador and \r\nColombia, heads of State intervened and were able to \r\nnavigate a conflict which, on the basis of history, in \r\nother situations would surely have degenerated into an \r\narmed conflict between two sister countries.  \r\n What I want to say with this is that, for us, the \r\nexercise of multilateralism is not simply a hackneyed \r\nspeech. It is a deeply-held conviction and a concrete \r\nand objective policy, showing results in what are \r\nnormally called emerging regions, where we are \r\ncapable of giving examples of multilateral \r\ncollaboration in overcoming conflicts.  \r\n The other reform that we have always promoted \r\nis that of the multilateral credit institutions, but \r\nfundamentally the reform of an economic model that \r\nplaced the generation of wealth at the centre of the \r\nfictional economy and of the world of finances. Recent \r\ndays show that those matters, those positions, were not \r\nthe result of an ideological bias or closed dogmas but \r\nof objective and timely observation of what was going \r\non.  \r\n Today, we cannot speak of the “caipirinha effect” \r\nor the “tequila effect” or the “rice effect”, or the effect \r\nthat always showed that the crisis moved from the \r\nemerging countries towards the centre. Today, if we \r\nwere to give it a name, we would have to say, perhaps, \r\nthe “jazz effect”, which moves from the centre of the \r\nfirst economy of the world and spreads to the rest of \r\nthe world. That situation does not make us content or \r\nhappy. \r\n Quite the contrary, we consider this an historic \r\nopportunity to review behaviour and policies, because \r\nduring the period of the Washington Consensus, we — \r\nthe countries of South America — were told that the \r\nmarket would solve everything, that the State was not \r\nnecessary, that State intervention was something for \r\nwhich groups that had not understood how the \r\neconomy had developed were nostalgic. However, now \r\nwe are seeing the most formidable State intervention in \r\nmemory from exactly the place where we had been told \r\nthat the State was not necessary, in the framework, \r\nmoreover, of an incredible fiscal and trade deficit.  \r\n My country, the Argentine Republic — which, if \r\nit continues to grow at the rates at which it has been \r\ngrowing since 2003, will this year be completing the \r\nlargest economic growth cycle of its almost 200-year \r\nhistory — has always upheld the need for a State \r\npresence, fundamentally because the market does not \r\nassign resources to the most vulnerable sectors and \r\nbecause we see the State as connecting the interests of \r\nsociety and market interests.  \r\n Since 2003, an Argentina that had been in debt up \r\nto as much as 160 per cent of its GDP has today \r\nreduced its debt to almost 50 per cent of GDP. We have \r\nfully paid our debt to the International Monetary Fund \r\n(IMF), and about 15 days ago we announced that we \r\nwill settle our debt with the Paris Club, which had a \r\ncut-off date of 10 December 1983 — the very year \r\nwhen the first democratic President took office, after \r\nthe dictatorship. Here in New York yesterday, in the \r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, I announced that \r\nArgentina has received a proposal from three very \r\nimportant banks that represent bond-holders who did \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n25 08-51570 \r\n \r\nnot participate in the 2005 bond exchange and who are \r\nproposing to do so in conditions more favourable for \r\nmy country, Argentina, than those of the 2005 \r\nexchange.  \r\n Thus we believe not only that our strategy has \r\nbeen correct but that it is absolutely necessary for all of \r\nus to review, with a great deal of intellectual humility, \r\nwhat is happening today in the markets and see what \r\nare the possible solutions for overcoming the situation. \r\nWe emerging countries have a great advantage in what \r\nwe do not have: no credit risk agency will come, \r\nnobody from the IMF will come tell us what to do, a \r\ngreat country that has grown on the basis of its real \r\neconomy and today really has problems on the basis of \r\na casino economy or a fictional economy, where it was \r\nthought that only capitalism can produce money. I \r\nalways say that capitalism was invented in order to \r\nearn money, but on the basis of the production of \r\ngoods, services and knowledge. Money alone does not \r\nproduce more money. It has to go through the circuit of \r\nproduction, work, knowledge, services and goods so \r\nthat there can be a virtuous cycle that can generate \r\nwell-being for the whole of society.  \r\n Finally, I want to mention a matter that affects \r\nnot only my country, beyond its geographical location, \r\nbut also concerns this Assembly and also the need to \r\nface the twenty-first century without colonial enclaves. \r\nHere I refer to the issue of our Malvinas Islands, \r\nwhere, despite the resolutions of this body, despite all \r\nthe measures taken here for the United Kingdom to \r\nagree, in virtue of what is set out in Article 33 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, to negotiate in peace \r\nbetween the parties, that country resolutely refuses to \r\ndiscuss with the Argentine Republic the issue of the \r\nMalvinas Islands.  \r\n I believe that a member of the Security  \r\nCouncil — one that is among the principal nations of \r\nthe world in the defence of freedom, human rights and \r\ndemocracy — should give concrete proof that it is not \r\njust talk but that it is truly convinced that it is \r\nnecessary to end this shame, that of a colonial enclave \r\nin the twenty-first century. I want to request again, as \r\nhave the different Presidents who preceded me — \r\nbecause Malvinas is for Argentineans a State policy as \r\nwell — the cooperation that this body has always \r\nprovided to once again urge the United Kingdom to \r\nagree to comply with international law and to \r\ndemonstrate that it is serious in wishing to build a \r\ndifferent world and a different citizenry.  \r\n Lastly, I wish to speak to all those men and \r\nwomen who have institutional governmental \r\nresponsibilities in any of the branches of the State in \r\ntheir respective countries to once again advocate for \r\nthe transformation of an international policy that has \r\nits fullest expression in this House. The reform of the \r\ninstruments that we are requesting is not simply a \r\nquestion of cosmetics and formulas and changes that \r\nbarely conceal that everything is continuing as it \r\nstands. The present situation, the complexity of the \r\nworld that is coming, in terms of food and energy, \r\nrequires all of us to re-examine our behaviour and our \r\nparadigms. We must accept with humility that it is \r\nnecessary to build a world that is different from the one \r\nwe have had to date — one in which respect for human \r\nrights, for the will of peoples and for those who are \r\ndifferent, do not think as we do or who pray to a \r\ndifferent god is not merely a catalogue of good \r\nintentions set out in the United Nations Charter, but a \r\nreality that is experienced a little more concretely \r\nevery day. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\n Ms. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of \r\nthe Republic of Madagascar \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar. \r\n Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Marc \r\nRavalomanana, President of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ravalomanana (spoke in French): \r\nEight years ago in this very Hall, we, the leaders of the \r\nworld, solemnly adopted the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Three years ago, we reviewed the \r\nGoals to assess the progress made thus far. We realized \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 26 \r\n \r\nthat the Goals were in danger of not being attained by \r\nthe year 2015, and we all acknowledged that we would \r\nbe able to achieve them only through a considerable \r\nincrease in our efforts. \r\n Have we been able to deliver on those promises \r\nand commitments? I am afraid that we have not. In \r\nfact, the situation is more complex now than it was \r\nthree years ago. We are facing a global food crisis, a \r\nglobal economic crisis and a global security crisis, with \r\nwar and political hostilities spreading throughout the \r\nglobe. In spite of efforts to reduce the divisions \r\nbetween the rich and the poor, the progress we have \r\nmade so far on the MDGs has fallen far short of the \r\ntargets we established. \r\n Those global crises are of such importance that \r\nthey are threatening to delay the achievement of the \r\nMDGs beyond 2015. It would be a major mistake if we \r\nwere to do nothing to prevent that from happening. We \r\nmust remain focused on the achievement of the MDGs. \r\nI highly appreciate the aid and assistance provided by \r\ndonors and international organizations. Those \r\ninstitutions and their programmes are making a \r\ndifference in the daily lives of people throughout \r\nAfrica, including in Madagascar. \r\n In Madagascar, for example, under-five mortality \r\nrates have dropped from 159 to 94 per 1,000. Primary \r\nschool enrolment has increased from 67 per cent to \r\nmore than 92 per cent. A million Malagasy have risen \r\nout of poverty in the past five years. None of that \r\nwould have been possible without the support of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Unfortunately, official development assistance \r\ncontinues to shrink, while the aid provided by the \r\ninternational community remains insufficient. The \r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income \r\nallocated to official development assistance was set \r\nwith a view to achieving the MDGs in the developing \r\ncountries. In his report on Africa’s development needs \r\n(A/63/130), the Secretary-General rightly stresses that \r\nmost of the wealthy donor nations have failed to \r\ndeliver on their promises to help the world’s poorest \r\ncountries. The same report estimates that donor \r\ncountries must increase aid by $18 billion a year in \r\norder to honour their pledge to provide $50 billion \r\ndollars by 2010. \r\n In Africa, we continue to bear the consequences \r\nof those broken promises. Africa cannot break the \r\nvicious cycle of poverty: families have difficulties \r\nfeeding themselves and the number of families with \r\naccess to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation \r\ninfrastructure is very small. I call upon all donor \r\ncountries to honour their promises and to demonstrate \r\nleadership by explaining to their people why \r\nsupporting the MDGs and the fight against poverty is a \r\nmoral obligation and essential to creating a more stable \r\nand peaceful world. \r\n We are all aware of the current world food crisis. \r\nFor us and other countries, it is a heavy burden that \r\nposes many new challenges. The global food crisis is \r\npartly the result of the domestic agricultural subsidies \r\nand tariff protection practices of developed countries, \r\nwhich for many years have discouraged agricultural \r\nproduction in developing countries. In Africa, we find \r\nourselves in very difficult circumstances. Because we \r\nhave such low agricultural output, we are dependent on \r\nthe global marketplace to feed our people. With \r\ncommodity prices soaring, however, we cannot afford \r\nthe basic food items needed to survive. We are in an \r\nunprecedented crisis. Rising food prices are pushing \r\nmore people into absolute poverty. \r\n The international community needs to take urgent \r\nand coordinated action to counter the negative impacts \r\nof increasing food prices on poor and vulnerable \r\ncountries. Global trade policies must foster food \r\nsecurity for all. Developed countries must reform their \r\nagricultural subsidy policies and amend the strategies \r\nand practices that increase the volatility of \r\ninternational prices. The international community must \r\nalso help African countries to expand agriculture and to \r\nstrengthen agricultural investment and the infrastructure \r\nneeded for rural development. \r\n The new agricultural development strategies must \r\naddress the need for environmental management, \r\nsustainable development and the resistance of crops to \r\ndisease and climate change. Given the impact of global \r\nclimate change, maintaining healthy biodiversity is \r\ncritical to sustaining future production performance. \r\n Small subsistence farmers, representing 80 per \r\ncent of Africa’s population, are key to its development. \r\nWe must support them through a variety of \r\nprogrammes focused on training, access to finance and \r\nequipment, and marketing and distribution processes. \r\nThose small subsistence farmers must be an integral \r\npart of, and benefit from, a new model of agricultural \r\nproduction, economic development and environmental \r\nmanagement. In that regard, I appreciate the true value \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n27 08-51570 \r\n \r\nof the new dynamic of the Food and Agricultural \r\nOrganization’s pragmatic approach.  \r\n I would like to speak about what we are doing in \r\nMadagascar to address the challenge of food security. \r\nOur chief intention is to make Madagascar’s \r\nagriculture more productive, more sustainable and \r\nmore open to innovation and entrepreneurship, as the \r\ninitiative Future Farmers of Madagascar shows.  \r\n For example, we are promoting the widespread \r\nuse of the System of Rice Intensification, developed in \r\nMadagascar in the 1980s, an eco-friendly method of \r\nproduction that is an important part of the natural \r\nrevolution, recently launched in Madagascar. That \r\nrevolution is based on sustaining our natural resources \r\nand maintaining an ecological balance. It respects the \r\nsoil, the environment and the people. At the moment, \r\nas rice is the staple food of the people of Madagascar, \r\nwe are trying to keep the domestic rice price at an \r\naffordable level to protect the most vulnerable layers of \r\nthe population.  \r\n In addition to that food crisis, we are confronted \r\nwith other important challenges: climate change, \r\nincreasing energy prices, unpredictable financial \r\nmarkets and other threats to our peace and security. \r\nWhat are the consequences of those threats and \r\nchallenges?  \r\n First, those threats have a severe impact on the \r\neducation, health and well-being of the population. In \r\nshort, they have a very negative impact on our \r\ndevelopment. Secondly, those challenges are now \r\ncompeting with the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Many of the resources dedicated to achieving \r\nthe MDGs are now being directed elsewhere. They are \r\nbeing used to reconstruct countries destroyed by war or \r\nthat have collapsed as a result of social conflicts. They \r\nare also being used to stabilize the food markets, meet \r\nenergy demands and tackle climate change issues.  \r\n I understand that countries devastated by wars \r\nand other armed conflicts, by environmental disasters \r\nor by famine need assistance. I understand, and I \r\nsupport reforestation efforts and the need for new \r\nhydro-energy plants. What I do not understand, \r\nhowever, is that all those challenges and threats offer \r\nreasons for countries to abdicate on their promises of \r\ndoubled aid for education, health and infrastructure, in \r\norder to achieve the MDGs in developing countries, \r\nespecially in Africa.  \r\n For that reason, I have repeatedly stressed the \r\nimportance of international assistance, especially the \r\nneed to increase, improve and better coordinate that \r\nassistance, if donors are to meet their previously \r\nagreed pledges. There are links between the MDGs and \r\nthe political, economic, environmental and other \r\nchallenges I have mentioned. Therefore, more \r\ninvestment towards achieving the MDGs will \r\ncontribute to addressing those challenges. In fact, \r\nimproving the situation of the most dominated is one of \r\nthe best means to solve them.  \r\n However, we must realize that those challenges \r\nwill not be solved by simply shifting resources from \r\none problem to another. It is clear that those other \r\nchallenges require additional resources and a better \r\ncoordination of efforts. Africa has been hit harder than \r\nany other continent by the food crisis, by higher energy \r\nprices, by environmental degradation, by disease and \r\nby social and political destabilization. That is why I \r\nwould like once again to reiterate the need for a new \r\nMarshall Plan for Africa.  \r\n It seems that many world leaders, and public \r\nopinion, have forgotten or neglected the MDGs. We \r\ncannot fill one group’s basket with the advantages of \r\nglobalization while we empty the basket of another \r\nthrough the cost of globalization. It is increasingly \r\nclear that domestic interests are serviced at the cost of \r\ninternational needs. The outcome of the latest round of \r\nthe World Trade Organization proved that. The lack of \r\nshared decision-making power in international \r\ninstitutions and global forums is a significant obstacle \r\nto making progress in developing countries and to \r\nachieving the MDGs. I would like to see a United \r\nNations that can mobilize the resources and political \r\nwill to tackle the toughest of problems — and succeed. \r\n I am optimistic. I believe that we can turn the \r\nsituation around. I appeal to you as leaders of the \r\nworld. Everyone needs to contribute more goodwill, \r\nmore motivation, more technical assistance, more \r\ncoordinated efforts and, above all, more financial \r\nresources to the international basket. If you want to do \r\nso, if we are all committed to doing so, we shall be \r\nable to confront those crises together and achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and I am sure that we \r\nare going to win.  \r\n The recent fourth Tokyo International Conference \r\non African Development provides an encouraging and \r\npromising example of our partners’ commitment and \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 28 \r\n \r\nwillingness to advance the development agenda of \r\nAfrica and to achieve the MDGs. More and more \r\nfoundations, such as the Gates, Rockefeller, \r\nMacArthur, Better U and Clinton Foundations, and \r\nothers, are playing a vital role in Africa. All those \r\ninitiatives are much appreciated.  \r\n Madagascar has embarked on the path of \r\ntransformation. To accelerate and better coordinate our \r\ndevelopment process and to make a quantum leap \r\nforward, we have created the Madagascar Action Plan, \r\nor MAP. It is a bold and ambitious, five-year plan that \r\naims to promote rapid growth, lead to the reduction of \r\npoverty and ensure that the country develops in \r\nresponse to the challenges of globalization and in \r\naccordance with the national vision, Madagascar \r\nNaturally, and with the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. To implement the plan we have mobilized the \r\nwhole population, whose active participation \r\nstrengthens its sense of national pride and country \r\nownership.  \r\n To help it move further on that path and to \r\nachieve the MDGs, the international community must \r\ndouble its efforts in Madagascar. For our part, we are \r\nresolved to assume our responsibilities, build trust with \r\nour partners, strengthen our capacities, promote \r\ndemocracy and good governance and take control of \r\nthe future of our country.  \r\n It is crucial to share the responsibility and to \r\nprove our ability for leadership in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. I am calling on the \r\nleaders of the world to confront the challenge of \r\ntransforming our thinking and our actions towards \r\ndevelopment to build a new Africa that becomes a \r\ncontinent of hope and opportunity.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Madagascar for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Boris Tadić, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Tadić: In 1945, on the heels of the \r\nmost destructive conflict the world had ever seen, \r\nfacing an uncertain future characterized by the threat of \r\nnuclear annihilation, the United Nations was \r\nestablished by men and women of strategic vision. In \r\nSan Francisco, my country proudly sat among the \r\nOrganization’s founders. \r\n Our courageous political ancestors created this \r\nOrganization in the belief that international law, based \r\non the doctrine of sovereign equality of States, must \r\nsupplant the use of force to settle differences between \r\nnations. This core abiding conviction of the founders \r\nmust be repeatedly reconfirmed. The founders’ sense of \r\npurpose must also be reaffirmed. And the obligation \r\nthey handed down to us must continue to be exercised \r\nby all with a solemn sense of responsibility. \r\n However much the world has changed since \r\n1945, the United Nations remains the only universal \r\nintergovernmental institution that unites us as a global \r\ncommunity of sovereign States. And standing at the \r\nvery heart of this indispensable Organization is the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the ultimate source of the \r\ninternational system’s legitimacy. The unique world \r\nforum that is the General Assembly brings us together \r\nas sovereign equals, each acting on behalf of a country, \r\nwith one vote, as guaranteed by the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The sacrosanct character of the foundational \r\ndoctrine of sovereign equality and its accompanying \r\nbinding obligation to respect each other’s sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity constitutes the very nature of \r\nthe enduring legitimacy of the United Nations. \r\n This arrangement has not changed, and I believe \r\nit must not change — unless we seek to overthrow the \r\nCharter and overturn the global legal order upon which \r\nit is built. \r\n I come before the General Assembly as the \r\nPresident of a country that has become caught up at the \r\nheart of one of the most dangerous challenges to the \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n29 08-51570 \r\n \r\nnature of the international system since the founding of \r\nthe United Nations. I speak of the unilateral, illegal and \r\nillegitimate declaration of independence by the ethnic \r\nAlbanian authorities of our southern province of \r\nKosovo and Metohija, a territory that stands at the \r\ncrucible of the identity of the Serbian people. It is the \r\nessential link between our proud national past and our \r\nproud European future. It is what ties the living \r\ntradition of Serbia to itself today. \r\n The attempt at secession took place on \r\n17 February 2008, in direct violation of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). Kosovo’s ethnic \r\nAlbanian leaders chose to take that unilateral step after \r\nwalking away from the negotiating table. They \r\nbelieved that if they walked away, the path to securing \r\nindependence would open up before them. They \r\nbelieved it because that is what they were told. And \r\nthey believed it because an artificial deadline on the \r\ntalks was affirmed from the outside, after which, if no \r\ncompromise solution was reached, Kosovo’s \r\nindependence would be imposed. \r\n Under such circumstances, a negotiated solution \r\nwas never a realistic option. With a fixed deadline and \r\na default position that fulfilled the maximalist demands \r\nof Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians, what incentive did they \r\nhave to negotiate with Serbia in good faith? All they \r\nhad to do was to pretend to engage in a process \r\npredetermined to fail and wait out the clock. \r\n The incentives for compromise were far \r\noutweighed by the incentives for maximalism. The \r\nresult was the rejection of Serbia’s reasonable offer of \r\nalmost unrestricted self-government, the broadest \r\npossible autonomy one can imagine. \r\n Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence \r\n(UDI) amounts to an attempt to partition a State \r\nMember of the United Nations against its will, and \r\nwith disregard for the firm opposition of the Security \r\nCouncil, in order to appease a volatile and threatening \r\nethnic minority. As a result, the very nature of the \r\ninternational system has been called into question. \r\n We all know that there are dozens of Kosovos \r\nthroughout the world, just waiting for secession to be \r\nlegitimized, to be turned into an acceptable norm. \r\nMany existing conflicts could escalate, frozen conflicts \r\ncould reignite, and new ones could be instigated. \r\n We have heard the argument that Kosovo is sui \r\ngeneris, that it is a unique case. But the truth is, that is \r\ntantamount to saying that Kosovo is an exception to \r\ninternational law, that Kosovo should stand beyond the \r\nrules that govern the behaviour of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The Republic of Serbia rejects that claim, \r\nbelieving that no people is authorized to declare itself \r\nan exception, especially when doing so is in defiance \r\nof the position taken by the Security Council. \r\n We face a defining moment. We must stand \r\ntogether in steadfastness and determination against a \r\nfundamental violation of international law. \r\n Serbia responded to Kosovo’s UDI with utmost \r\nresponsibility and restraint. Despite political turmoil, \r\nour country continued to work hard to contribute to \r\nmaintaining regional stability. From the very onset of \r\nthis grave crisis, Serbia has ruled out the use of force. \r\nAnd we have not exercised other unilateral options, \r\nsuch as the imposition of economic sanctions against \r\nour breakaway province. Instead, we have opted for a \r\npeaceful and diplomatic approach, the result of which \r\nis that a vast majority of States Members of the United \r\nNations have refrained from recognizing Kosovo’s \r\nUDI. They have continued to abide by their obligations \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations to respect the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. On \r\nbehalf of the Republic of Serbia, allow me once again \r\nto sincerely thank these countries for their adherence to \r\nthe principles of international law. \r\n Serbia proposes a non-confrontational way to \r\nrespond to the threat posed to its territorial integrity. \r\nWe have chosen to use the law. While rejecting \r\nviolence and unilateralism categorically, we are equally \r\nemphatic in demanding that justice be delivered \r\nthrough the proper legal means at the disposal of any \r\nState Member of the United Nations. To that end, the \r\nRepublic of Serbia has submitted a draft resolution to \r\nbe considered at this session of the General Assembly. \r\nLet me make it clear that the text of the draft resolution \r\nrefrains from taking political positions on Kosovo’s \r\nUDI. Instead, in simple and direct language, it asks the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations — the \r\nInternational Court of Justice — to render an advisory \r\nopinion on the following question: “Is the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence by the Provisional \r\nInstitutions of Self-Government of Kosovo in \r\naccordance with international law?” \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 30 \r\n \r\n We believe that sending the Kosovo question to \r\nthe International Court of Justice would prevent the \r\ncrisis from serving as a deeply problematic precedent \r\nin any part of the globe where secessionist ambitions \r\nare harboured. We also believe that an advisory opinion \r\nfrom the Court would provide politically neutral yet \r\njudicially authoritative guidance to many countries still \r\ndeliberating on how to approach Kosovo’s UDI in line \r\nwith international law. \r\n Members’ votes in support of the draft resolution \r\nwould serve to reaffirm another key international \r\nprinciple at stake: the right of any State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations to pose a simple, elementary question \r\non a matter it considers vitally important to the \r\ncompetent court. To vote against is in effect to vote to \r\ndeny the right of any country, now or in the future, to \r\nseek judicial recourse through the United Nations \r\nsystem. To vote against means to accept that nothing \r\ncan be done when secessionists in any part of the world \r\nproclaim the uniqueness of their cause and claim \r\nexception to the universal scope of international law. \r\nSuch an attitude could lead to the end of the United \r\nNations system as we know it. Allow me therefore to \r\nformally ask for the support of each and every Member \r\nState for Serbia’s proposal before the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n While the International Court of Justice \r\ndeliberates on the legality of UDI, Serbia will remain a \r\ngood-faith partner in the interim administration of our \r\nsouthern province. The functionality of a reconfigured \r\ninternational civilian presence under the overall \r\nauthority of the United Nations, as defined by \r\nresolution 1244 (1999), is of great importance to my \r\ncountry. It must remain status-neutral and cannot \r\ntherefore be based on the so-called Ahtisaari proposal, \r\nwhich was rejected by Serbia and not approved by the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n It is well known that the European Union (EU) \r\nhas committed itself to building the much-needed \r\ninstitutional and societal fabric of our southern \r\nprovince. Let there be no doubt: My country supports \r\nthe deepening of Europe’s engagement in any part of \r\nSerbia, including Kosovo. In order for Europe’s \r\npresence in Kosovo to be fully anchored within an \r\nacceptable, legitimate framework, it is vital that its \r\nmandate be approved by the Security Council. We will \r\nwork with the Member States and the Secretariat to \r\nensure that we achieve consensus in the near future on \r\nthe international civil presence in our southern \r\nprovince. \r\n In conclusion, I want to emphasize that the \r\ncentral strategic priority of the Republic of Serbia is \r\nrapid accession to the European Union. Serbia will join \r\nthe EU not only for reasons of geography, heritage, and \r\neconomic prosperity, but also because of the values we \r\nhold in common. They constitute the intangible \r\ngreatness of twenty-first-century Europe and they form \r\nthe foundation of our democracy, our society and our \r\nbeliefs in what we can accomplish. \r\n Our common values also point to the significance \r\nof reconciliation — an important reason why Serbia is \r\nfully cooperating with the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. We have \r\ndemonstrated our unequivocal commitment time and \r\nagain. We will continue to do so because it is our  \r\nduty — our legal, political and moral duty — to the \r\nvictims, to ourselves and, most of all, to the \r\ngenerations to come. \r\n Europe has become the unifying force of the \r\nregion. My country’s absolute dedication to joining the \r\nEU is shared by all the countries of the western \r\nBalkans. If we choose, as democracies, to belong to \r\nsomething that is greater than the sum of its parts, the \r\nbalkanization of the Balkans can be reversed. \r\n Serbia’s European vision is complemented by our \r\nstrong desire to continue restoring and deepening the \r\nmany close friendships that Yugoslavia made across the \r\nglobe during the post-Second World War period. It will \r\nbe one of the key priorities in the years to come for my \r\ncountry and my Government. As a country that is the \r\nlargest successor to a co-founder of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, Serbia will work hard to contribute to a \r\nmore equitable global community, devoted to \r\nadvancing the democratization of international \r\nrelations, economic and social development, and \r\nhuman rights. \r\n I close by saying that my country remains ready \r\nto further promote a nobler form of intergovernmental \r\ncooperation that truly addresses challenges, alleviates \r\ndivisions, and reduces tensions. Such a vision can be \r\nbuilt only on the firm foundation of the universal \r\nprinciples of sovereign equality, solidarity and \r\ninternational law within the framework of the United \r\nNations. \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n31 08-51570 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia for the statement just made.  \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania. \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho \r\nKikwete, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Kikwete: Allow me at the outset to \r\nconvey my very warm regards and congratulations to \r\nyou, Sir, on your well-deserved election to preside over \r\nthe sixty-third session of this Assembly. \r\n On behalf of the African Union, the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania and in my own name, I would \r\nlike to assure you of our unqualified support and \r\ncooperation throughout your term of office. Allow me \r\nalso to use this opportunity to thank and congratulate \r\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Srgjan Kerim, President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session, for \r\nhis leadership and for a job very well done. \r\n Our illustrious Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nBan Ki-moon, deserves special tribute from us for the \r\nexcellent manner in which he is discharging the \r\nresponsibilities of his high office. We appreciate the \r\nway in which he has answered the call of duty. My \r\ndelegation and I reaffirm our support for his great \r\nwork. His devotion to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) reversing the impact of \r\nclimate change and his concern for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment have won the hearts of many of us in the \r\ncontinent. \r\n As I stand before this Assembly in my dual \r\ncapacity as Chairman of the African Union and as \r\nPresident of my country, I bring with me a message of \r\nhope and optimism from Africa. Africa is no longer the \r\nhopeless case as perceived by some. There are so many \r\ngood things happening in the continent. There is \r\nincreasing political stability, peace reigns in almost all \r\nnations but a few and the economies of many nations \r\nare blossoming. \r\n Africa is now a continent in full embrace of \r\ndemocracy, good governance, rule of law and respect \r\nfor human rights. There is stronger commitment to deal \r\nwith vices in society, including the problems of \r\ncorruption. \r\n Most African countries have embraced \r\ndemocratic governance and regular, periodic elections \r\nare the norm. In the past two years, a good number of \r\nAfrican countries have successfully held democratic \r\nelections. It is a matter of principle enshrined in the \r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union that leaders who \r\ncome into office through undemocratic means are not \r\nallowed to participate in the activities of the African \r\nUnion. It is this principle that guided the African Union \r\nin suspending Mauritania from the organs of the \r\nAfrican Union until democratic dispensations are \r\nrestored. \r\n It is heart-warming, indeed, that Africans, \r\nthrough the African Union and their regional economic \r\norganizations, have been proactive and have taken the \r\nlead in monitoring elections and resolving conflicts \r\nwhere they have arisen. This was the case with Kenya \r\nand very recently with Zimbabwe. Indeed, Africa has \r\ncome of age. The old principle of non-interference in \r\ninternal affairs is surely being replaced by \r\nnon-indifference to violations of democracy and abuse \r\nof human rights in Member States. \r\n There are fewer conflicts in the continent today \r\nthan was the case a few years ago. This is testimony to \r\nthe fact that democracy and good governance are \r\ntaking root and the African peace and security \r\narchitecture is working. However, much more needs to \r\nbe done to strengthen the African Union’s capacity for \r\nearly warning, conflict prevention and conflict \r\nresolution. There is also a need to do the same with the \r\nregional economic groupings to buttress their \r\npeacebuilding efforts. \r\n I would like to recognize the United Nations, the \r\nEuropean Union and States and other institutions in the \r\nworld that have generously supported the strengthening \r\nof the infant African Union peace and security \r\nmechanism. I would like to call on all of them to \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 32 \r\n \r\ncontinue supporting the African Union mechanism as \r\nwell as the regional mechanisms and peacekeeping \r\noperations in Africa. \r\n There are only three conflict situations worth \r\nmentioning and discussing in this Assembly today. \r\nThese concern the conflicts in Darfur and Somalia and \r\nthe volatile security situation in the eastern part of \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n In Darfur, the humanitarian crisis still persists \r\nalthough there may be some encouraging signs of \r\nimprovement. I believe the situation would be much \r\nbetter if the entire contingent of the United Nations \r\nHybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) forces was \r\ndeployed, and the peace talks between the rebels and \r\nthe Government of Sudan were resumed and \r\nconcluded. Also, improvement would be seen if \r\nhumanitarian aid work was allowed to be carried out \r\nunencumbered and matters related to justice were dealt \r\nwith judiciously. \r\n There is a need therefore for the United Nations, \r\nthe African Union and the Government of the Sudan to \r\ncontinue to work together expeditiously to remove the \r\nobstacles impeding the deployment of UNAMID, to \r\nremove the obstacles impeding the dialogue between \r\nthe Government of the Sudan and the rebels, impeding \r\nhumanitarian operations and impeding the process of \r\ndispensation of justice in Darfur. \r\n I was in Sudan two weeks ago and held very \r\nfruitful discussions with His Excellency President \r\nOmar Al-Bashir. I also met officials of the Joint \r\nUN-AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur. We discussed \r\nthe situation in Darfur, the obstacles involved and \r\ncame to some understanding on the way forward. I am \r\nhopeful that progress can be made. We need to seize \r\nthe moment and the opportunities that are now \r\nunfolding. \r\n It is the considered view of the African Union \r\nthat the indictment of President Omar Al-Bashir at this \r\nparticular point in time will complicate the deployment \r\nof UNAMID and the management of the humanitarian \r\ncrisis in Darfur. It is for this reason that the African \r\nUnion sees deferment as the most expedient measure \r\nnow. \r\n Let me make one thing clear: when we talk about \r\ndeferment, we should not in any way be perceived as \r\ncondoning injustice. Justice is a matter of essence. It \r\nmust be done, it must be seen to be done. We are \r\nsimply concerned with the best possible sequencing of \r\nmeasures so that the most immediate matters of saving \r\nlives and easing the suffering of the people of Darfur \r\nare taken care of first. Getting the support and \r\ncooperation of the Government of the Sudan is a matter \r\nof essence in the fulfilment of all that we want to seen \r\ndone in Darfur. \r\n The conflict in Somalia remains difficult to \r\nmanage and resolve. The inter-party dialogue has not \r\nyet borne the desired results. The African Union \r\npeacekeeping efforts seem to be overstretched. We call \r\nupon the United Nations to step in and take over the \r\npeacekeeping responsibilities at the earliest possible \r\ntime before the African Union mission is overwhelmed. \r\nTime is of the essence. Let me use this opportunity to \r\ncommend the Governments of Ethiopia, Uganda and \r\nBurundi for their invaluable contribution to \r\npeacekeeping efforts in Somalia. \r\n The volatile security situation in the eastern \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is a matter of great \r\nconcern. We are deeply saddened by the ongoing \r\nfighting between the government forces and rebel \r\nforces of General Laurent Nkunda. The continued \r\npresence of negative forces threatening the security of \r\ncountries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo is another complicating factor. \r\n The African Union is committed to be more \r\nproactive in the search for lasting peace in that \r\ntroubled region. We will work with regional leaders \r\nand the United Nations in that regard. \r\n On September 15 this year, a landmark \r\nbreakthrough was achieved in the Zimbabwe political \r\ncrisis when the three political parties to the conflict: \r\nThe African National Union-Patriotic Front, the \r\nMovement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai and the \r\nMovement for Democratic Change-Mutambara, signed \r\nthe historic agreement for ending the conflict and \r\nforming an inclusive Government. The leaders of those \r\nthree parties are now engaged in the process of \r\nimplementing that agreement. Getting to this point in a \r\nconflict situation that seemed almost impossible to \r\nresolve is a major achievement indeed. \r\n We need to congratulate President Robert \r\nMugabe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and \r\nDeputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara on their \r\nwisdom and statesmanship. We also need to \r\nacknowledge, recognize and commend, in a special \r\nmanner, President Thabo Mbeki of the Republic of \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n33 08-51570 \r\n \r\nSouth Africa for his sterling leadership. It was his \r\npatience, perseverance and understanding that made it \r\nall happen. His imminent departure from office, which \r\ncomes suddenly, raises some concerns about what may \r\nhappen if difficulties are experienced with the \r\nimplementation of the agreement. I see no cause for \r\nalarm. The South African Government remains, and I \r\nam sure the new leadership will continue to be, seized \r\nof the matter.  \r\n Moreover, since the agreement is the product of \r\nthe decision taken in July by the African Union at its \r\nsummit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the African Union \r\nand the Southern Africa Development Community \r\nstand ready to assist if need should arise. \r\n We in Africa thank you, Mr. President, for \r\nincluding the food and oil crises among the themes for \r\nthis session of the General Assembly. The current \r\nglobal escalation of food and fuel prices has reached \r\ncrisis proportions. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region \r\naffected the most. It is home to the majority of the least \r\ndeveloped countries on this planet. Their food and oil \r\nbills have increased exponentially. Food import bills \r\nhave increased by over 40 per cent over the past year, \r\nwhile oil prices have increased by over 100 per cent \r\nsince 2005. Even the recent drop in oil prices has not \r\nhelped much, because prices are still more than twice \r\nwhat they were in 2005. \r\n The high food and oil prices threaten to erode the \r\nhumble gains made in implementing the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and sustaining macroeconomic \r\nstability in Africa. The food and oil crisis, coupled with \r\nthe worsening financial crisis throughout the world, \r\ngives us every reason to be very worried. The need for \r\ncomprehensive action to reverse the situation cannot be \r\noveremphasized. We call upon the international \r\ncommunity and key players in the global economy to \r\nact quickly. The United Nations should take the lead. \r\n Yesterday, this Assembly held a high-level event \r\non Africa’s development needs. The meeting received a \r\ncomprehensive report from the Secretary-General on \r\n“Africa’s development needs: state of implementation \r\nof various commitments, challenges and the way \r\nforward” (A/63//130). We are glad to note that the \r\nreport incorporated some of the recommendations of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals Africa Steering \r\nGroup. \r\n The report’s findings underscore the fact that \r\nAfrica cannot meet its development needs without the \r\nsupport of the international community. Indeed, the \r\ninternational community has been responding \r\nfavourably. A number of commitments to assisting \r\nAfrica have been made over the years in different \r\ninternational forums. Unfortunately, the commitments \r\nmade have not been met fully. \r\n We appeal to the General Assembly to echo the \r\ncall and impress upon Africa’s development partners \r\nthe need to honour their promise and deliver on their \r\ncommitments. I also urge this family of United Nations \r\nMember States to fully support the political declaration \r\nadopted at the high-level meeting yesterday, as we re-\r\ndedicate ourselves to meeting the development needs \r\nof Africa. \r\n We in Africa have been following with keen \r\ninterest the ongoing process of the reform of the United \r\nNations. We remain convinced of the ideal that a \r\nreform of the United Nations would be incomplete \r\nwithout a reform of the Security Council. On our part, \r\nwe have authorized our permanent representatives in \r\nNew York to embark on negotiations with all parties on \r\nthe reforms of the Security Council. At this juncture, I \r\nshould reiterate the position of the African Union of \r\nasking for two permanent seats with veto power and \r\ntwo non-permanent seats. Our demand should be seen \r\nagainst the backdrop of the reality that Africa is the \r\nonly continent without a permanent seat in the Security \r\nCouncil, despite our large membership in the United \r\nNations. That is an anomaly. It has to be corrected. The \r\nreform of the Security Council, therefore, should take \r\nthat into account. \r\n The reforms of the United Nations have, on the \r\nother hand, to enable the Organization to work better \r\nand be more efficient, effective and responsive to the \r\nchallenges of our times. We are happy with the work of \r\nthe General Assembly at its previous sessions on \r\nadvancing the United Nations system-wide coherence \r\nagenda. The work has thus far advanced \r\nintergovernmental consultations on the United Nations \r\ndelivering as one: one programme, one budget, one \r\noffice and one leader. \r\n Tanzania is one of the eight pilot countries on the \r\nUnited Nations “delivering as one” project. Our \r\nexperience so far has shown that delivering as one is \r\npossible. It improves national ownership and \r\nstrengthens national leadership in the development \r\nprocess. It permits the realignment of United Nations \r\nassistance with national priorities and streamlines \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 34 \r\n \r\nbusiness transactions, thus enhancing the efficiency \r\nand effectiveness of United Nations activities. I urge \r\nthis Assembly to follow up on the implementation of \r\nthis important reform, and I appeal to our development \r\npartners to provide the requisite resources. \r\n At the sixtieth session of this Assembly, I \r\nreported on the work of the Helsinki Process on \r\nGlobalisation and Democracy, a joint initiative \r\nlaunched in 2003 and co-chaired by Finland and \r\nTanzania. The Helsinki Process, a forum to facilitate \r\nmulti-stakeholder dialogue on the possibilities offered \r\nand challenges posed by the process of globalization, \r\nhas come to an end. The main objective of that \r\ninitiative was to mobilize political will in support of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The President of \r\nFinland, Ms. Tarja Halonen, and I would be glad, as \r\nco-chairs of the Process, to present the final report to \r\nthe Secretary-General this week. We trust that the \r\nreport will add impetus to global efforts to see political \r\nwill prevail in the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. A democracy deficit in \r\ninternational institutions is attendant. \r\n Before I conclude, allow me to mention three \r\nthings. First, I would remind this world body that the \r\nWestern Sahara problem remains unresolved. Allow me \r\nto make a humble appeal to the Security Council to \r\nexpedite the process so that the matter is concluded \r\nsoon. It has been going on for too long. The people of \r\nthe Western Sahara will then be given the opportunity \r\nto determine which way to go. They deserve to be \r\nafforded the opportunity to live a normal life in a \r\nnation that has been designated as theirs. \r\n Secondly, we should remain seized of the \r\nPalestinian question until the two-State solution — the \r\nState of Israel and a State of Palestine living together \r\nside by side and in harmony — is attained.  \r\n Thirdly, there is a matter that we discussed at the \r\nmost recent African Union summit. It is with regard to \r\nthe issue of universal jurisdiction being practiced by \r\nsome European nations. It has now become a matter of \r\nharassment for African leaders. We discussed the matter \r\nat length at the summit, and we intend to raise this issue \r\nwith the United Nations for appropriate attention. \r\n Once again, I would like to reiterate the support \r\nof the African Union and Tanzania of your efforts, Sir, \r\nin fulfilling our collective objectives during this sixty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly. Count on our \r\nsupport; rely on our support. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania for the statement he \r\nhas just made.  \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Didjob Divungi Di Ndinge, \r\nVice-President of the Gabonese Republic  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Vice-President of the \r\nGabonese Republic. \r\n Mr. Didjob Divungi Di Ndinge, Vice-President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Didjob \r\nDivungi Di Ndinge, Vice-President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Divungi Di Ndinge (Gabon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At the outset, on behalf of His Excellency El \r\nHadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic and head of State, whom I have the honour to \r\nrepresent here, I should like to sincerely congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. You can be assured \r\nof our full and entire readiness to cooperate to ensure \r\nthe success of your weighty mission. It is also my \r\npleasure to pay a well-deserved tribute to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the \r\ntalent and dedication that he showed in guiding our \r\nwork throughout the sixty-second session. Finally, to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, I express my encouragement as he \r\ncarries out his lofty duties at the head of our \r\nOrganization. \r\n The food crisis that is currently raging is \r\ncharacterized by rising prices for foodstuffs. Its causes \r\nare both structural and immediate. Indeed, the \r\npredominance of biofuel crops over subsistence crops \r\nand the implementation of trade policies based on \r\nsubsidies and export restrictions have a disastrous \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n35 08-51570 \r\n \r\nimpact on food security. The food riots of the second \r\nhalf of 2008, which have taken place throughout the \r\nworld — particularly in Africa — in response to \r\nsoaring food prices, reflect a major crisis and express \r\nthe increased difficulties faced by hundreds of millions \r\nof people in feeding themselves.  \r\n One hardly need repeat the words said by  \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali when, in November 1999, \r\nhe addressed the thirtieth session of the Conference of \r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations (FAO): “Hunger is as unacceptable as war.” It \r\nis therefore urgent that we make a lasting response to \r\nthe food crisis by taking collective action at the global \r\nlevel to halt it and ensure food security for our most \r\nvulnerable populations.  \r\n Here, I should like to commend the adoption, on \r\n5 June 2008, of the Declaration of the High-level \r\nConference on World Food Security by heads of State \r\nor Government meeting in Rome. Likewise, at the \r\nregional level, we welcome the conclusions of the \r\nregional meeting on the food crisis held on 29 July \r\n2008 in Kinshasa under the auspices of the Economic \r\nCommunity of Central African States. At the \r\ncontinental level, we call for the effective \r\nimplementation of the July 2003 Maputo Declaration, \r\nwhich sets out a framework for accelerating \r\nagricultural development and food security; the 2006 \r\nAbuja Declaration, which advocates a green revolution \r\nin Africa; and, more recently, the Sharm el-Sheikh \r\nDeclaration on the challenges of the increase in food \r\nprices and agricultural development.  \r\n It is in that contact that Gabon, like other \r\ncountries of the South hit by this crisis, has taken \r\nurgent fiscal and budgetary measures supported by a \r\nsix-month suspension of import duties and taxes on \r\nconsumer products and a suspension of the value-added \r\ntax on such products, causing a substantial loss in \r\nterms of the State budget.  \r\n In addition, from a medium- and long-term \r\nperspective, Gabon is working together with \r\ninternational partners, in particular FAO and the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), to \r\nimplement its national poverty reduction strategy and \r\nits special food security programme. The latter \r\nincorporates aspects related to water management, \r\nintensifying vegetable production and diversifying and \r\nincreasing agricultural production. We are prepared to \r\ngo even further, because we must banish the spectre of \r\nhunger and malnutrition once and for all. The \r\nachievement of Millennium Development Goal 1 \r\ndepends on that.  \r\n Furthermore, the food crisis poses the problem of \r\nthe role and place of agriculture in our economies. \r\nRather than making us overly concerned, it should lead \r\nus to rethink that sector in order to increase its \r\ncontribution to the development of our countries. \r\n The challenge of feeding a planet with a growing \r\npopulation is closely linked to the environmental issue \r\nand to climate change. Environmental degradation is \r\ncharacterized by the degradation of natural resources, \r\nincluding the growing water shortage, the increase in \r\narid lands, deforestation and the effects of global \r\nwarming. All these elements prevent an increase in \r\nagricultural production that could contribute to a lasting \r\nsolution to the food crisis. Thus, we must do our utmost \r\nto significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  \r\n That is why my country welcomes the road map \r\nadopted during the negotiations held in Bali, as the \r\noutcome of the thirteenth session of the Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. The road map is an \r\nimportant step towards the formulation of a follow-up \r\nto the Kyoto Protocol, which is set to expire in 2012. \r\nHere I should like to commend the recent efforts made \r\nby the industrialized countries at the Group of Eight \r\n(G-8) summit held in Hokkaido, Japan, in July 2008, at \r\nwhich they once again reaffirmed their will to halve \r\ntheir greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \r\n For its part, my country, Gabon, whose forests are \r\none of the components of the important Congo  \r\nBasin — the planet’s second ecological lung, after the \r\nAmazon — has acceded without reservation to the \r\nconventions related to the fight against climate change \r\nand the preservation of biodiversity. Indeed, we have \r\ndecided to shoulder our share of the responsibility by \r\ndevoting 11 per cent of our territory to humankind \r\nthrough, inter alia, the establishment of 13 national \r\nparks. Naturally, those efforts require others, in \r\nparticular the admission of our forests into the carbon-\r\ntrading mechanisms and the granting of compensatory \r\nmeasures to African countries by industrialized \r\ncountries, which are the primary emitters of carbon \r\ndioxide.  \r\n Developing countries need the international \r\ncommunity’s ongoing and substantial support to meet \r\nthe new challenges that they face. It is thus urgent that \r\nA/63/PV.5  \r\n \r\n08-51570 36 \r\n \r\nall development partners keep their promises, in \r\nparticular by doubling official development assistance, \r\nintroducing innovative development financing methods \r\nand cancelling debt, whose burden undermines our \r\ndevelopment efforts. \r\n This appeal also has to do with the varying \r\nconstraints that weigh on developing countries, \r\nparticularly HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria and other \r\ninfectious diseases that impact their populations and \r\ntheir economies. In fact, with regard to HIV/AIDS, the \r\nefforts of African countries to provide universal access \r\nto prevention, care and treatment by 2010 do not appear \r\nto be sufficient to eradicate that modern-day scourge. \r\n The interdependence of the threats confronting \r\nthe international community highlights more than ever \r\nthe need to provide a new impetus to the efforts to \r\npromote solidarity and international peace and security. \r\nIn a number of regions around the world, tensions and \r\ndeep crises maintain instability and insecurity, thereby \r\ninhibiting any chance for development.  \r\n Specifically with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict, we can never emphasize enough that only \r\nconcerted and thorough efforts based on the principle \r\nof two States — Israel and Palestine — living in peace \r\nand security within secure and internationally \r\nrecognized borders will make it possible to bring about \r\na lasting, just and equitable solution to that conflict. \r\n In Africa as well there are many hotspots of \r\ntension that continue to be concern. That is the case \r\nwith respect to Somalia, where the instability that has \r\nprevailed for more than 15 years undermines any \r\nfledgling development. Still, we should commend the \r\nrecent efforts to promote a political process that would \r\nbe open to all in that country, in particular reaching the \r\nagreement signed on 9 June 2008 in Djibouti between \r\nthe Federal Transition Government and the Alliance for \r\nthe Reliberation of Somalia under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations, with the support of the African Union. \r\nOne hopes that that event, which is a true opportunity \r\ntowards a lasting settlement of that conflict, will lead \r\nto the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperation that could help end the chaos that has \r\nprevailed in that country since 1990. \r\n The overall security situation in Darfur also \r\ncontinues to be a source of great concern for the \r\ninternational community. One should, however, \r\ncommend and encourage the tenacious efforts \r\nundertaken in the joint mediation of the African Union \r\nand the United Nations in carrying out an inclusive \r\nprocess that would lead to a settlement to the conflict \r\nin Darfur, which has lasted for a number of years. \r\n The situation between Chad and the Sudan has \r\nsparked genuine hope, due to the resumption of dialogue \r\nbetween those two States within the framework of the \r\nvarious agreements that they have signed, particularly \r\nthe Dakar Agreement of 13 March 2008. \r\n With respect to Central African Republic, we can \r\nonly commend the meaningful progress made within \r\nthe framework of the preparations for an inclusive \r\npolitical dialogue since the first meeting of the follow-\r\nup committee on peace talks. We encourage the United \r\nNations and international partners to commit further in \r\nrebuilding that fraternal country. \r\n Lastly, with respect to Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon \r\nwelcomes the progress made in the implementation of \r\nthe Ouagadougou Agreement and its additional \r\nagreements. We appeal to the various partners of that \r\nfraternal country to support those efforts. \r\n The myriad challenges we have just addressed \r\ncan be dealt with only through collective actions at the \r\nglobal level. That is why the heads of State and \r\nGovernment recognized in the Millennium Declaration \r\nand reaffirmed in the Outcome Document of the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit the need to strengthen the United \r\nNations in order to make it a tool that would allow \r\nthem to better achieve their priority goals. That is why \r\nmy country welcomes the fact that since the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, most of the major recommendations in \r\nthe Outcome Document have been implemented in the \r\nframework of the process of reform of the United \r\nNations. The establishment of two major bodies — the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, which have been operational since June \r\n2006 — is a perfect demonstration of this.  \r\n Bolstered by the major progress made, we need to \r\ncontinue our efforts over the coming sessions to \r\ncomplete the reform process. For example, we need to \r\ncomplete the revitalization of the General Assembly, \r\nthe Organization’s most representative deliberative \r\nbody. Similarly, consistency in the actions of the \r\nUnited Nations bodies should be reinforced. From that \r\nstandpoint, I wish to commend the Delivering as One \r\ninitiative, which has had encouraging results in the \r\npilot countries. \r\n A/63/PV.5\r\n \r\n37 08-51570 \r\n \r\n Regarding reform in the Security Council, we \r\nneed to commend the tireless efforts of the different \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, which have made \r\nit possible to complete the process of consultations that \r\nshould lead to the beginning of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations by 31 January 2009, at the latest. The \r\nbuilding of a more just and secure world that would \r\nmeet the deep aspirations of our peoples depends on \r\nthat. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Didjob Divungi Di Ndinge, Vice-President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m. \r\n"
