(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Beck (Solomon \r\nIslands), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka. \r\nMr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \r\nLanka, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Rajapaksa (spoke in Sinhala and in \r\nTamil; English text provided by the delegation) Sri \r\nLanka congratulates the President on his election to \r\nthis high office. We are confident that your guidance \r\nwill enable the General Assembly to make progress on \r\nthe important issues confronting humanity to make the \r\nwork and role of the United Nations more relevant to \r\nthe lives of billions of people. \r\n While my mother tongue is Sinhala, let me \r\nelaborate a few thoughts in Tamil. Sinhala and Tamil \r\nare the two languages of the people of Sri Lanka. Both \r\nhave been used through the centuries, are rich in \r\nliterature and are widely used in my country, with \r\nrecognition as official languages. With the widening of \r\ndemocracy in our country, the bonds between the \r\nSinhala and Tamil people of Sri Lanka will grow \r\nstronger and remain a major force for its future \r\ndevelopment. We will march towards a richer freedom \r\nand the lasting unity that await us as a nation. \r\n The theme of our debate — “The impact of the \r\nglobal food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world \r\nas well as the need to democratize the United \r\nNations” — is indeed far-sighted. It focuses on one of \r\nthe critical survival needs of humanity, as well as one \r\nof the key institutional needs of the world body. The \r\nglobal food crisis has become a frightening actuality \r\nand has the potential to assume even more dangerous \r\nproportions if we fail to take urgent and collective \r\naction. Similarly, a less democratic United Nations \r\nruns the risk of being less effective and less credible, \r\nwhile giving rise to major concerns about its \r\nlegitimacy. \r\n Through a series of projects with regional impact, \r\nSri Lanka will contribute to the goal of increasing food \r\nproduction, investing more in agriculture and research \r\nand sharing technologies and best practices. That is an \r\nintegral part of the rural empowerment that is so \r\nessential in the developing world, as the vast majority \r\nof our people are rural based and depend on agriculture \r\nfor their livelihoods. Achieving food security would \r\nrequire strengthening and revitalizing the agriculture \r\nsector. That calls for the empowerment of small- and \r\nmedium-scale farmers through a series of measures. \r\nThose represent vital collective steps by all of us in the \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 2 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations system. Sri Lanka sees self-sufficiency \r\nas the answer to overcoming the food crisis and giving \r\nstrength to nations. No longer can we expect farmers in \r\ndeveloping countries to be mainly producers for export \r\nmarkets.  \r\n In that context, implementation of effective social \r\nsafety nets remains a priority as reassurance and \r\nempowerment. That is why we have introduced social \r\nsecurity measures such as the fertilizer and fisheries \r\nsubsidies. The advice given by some powerful \r\ncountries and powerful institutions are contrary to that. \r\nYet it is necessary that we pay no heed to such advice \r\nand determine to do what is best for the innocent \r\npeople of our countries. \r\n As the current Chair of the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), I \r\nhave the honour to state that at the recent summit we \r\naffirmed our resolve as a region to make our own \r\ncontribution to grapple with the food crisis and to make \r\nour region revive its historic critical role in food \r\nproduction by once again becoming a major granary of \r\nthe world. We also decided on the immediate \r\nestablishment and operationalization of the SAARC \r\nFood Bank. That mechanism, we believe, will help \r\nconsiderably to ensure both food and nutritional \r\nsecurity for the people of South Asia. That initiative \r\nwill contribute to the larger global efforts that we \r\nlaunched in Rome, in June this year, to avert and \r\nmitigate the impact of the food crisis. \r\n We must also find solutions to the energy crisis \r\nthat are both equitable and pragmatic. Energy supplies \r\nmust be diversified by developing advanced, cleaner, \r\nmore efficient and cost-effective technologies for both \r\nfossil fuels and renewable energy sources. We need to \r\nengage in energy conservation and accept the reality of \r\ndependence on fossil fuels for much longer. \r\n Equally obvious is the imperative of transferring \r\nnew technology to the developing countries. In our \r\nown region, we will use increasing resources of human \r\nand scientific talent to produce our own technologies, \r\nmaking the best use of the natural resources, the sun, \r\nwind and the ocean, which we have in abundance, free \r\nof the restrictions of the marketplace. The demands of \r\nhumanity can no longer be allowed to be at the mercy \r\nof speculative or captive markets. \r\n To that end, Sri Lanka’s own view is that the \r\nUnited Nations and its agencies must take leadership in \r\ndeveloping a framework for international cooperation. \r\nWe urge caution in the rush to use biofuels to break our \r\ndependence of fossil fuels. It has already been seen that \r\nthe rush to biofuels has contributed to high food prices. \r\nSri Lanka’s policy is that no arable land should be \r\ndiverted or directed to the production of biofuels, \r\nhowever profitable that may be in the short term. It was \r\npropitious that Sri Lanka acted with courage and \r\nforesight over the last three years, without being cowed \r\nby many pressures, and thus did not confront any \r\nsituation where our people had to face hunger or \r\nstarvation. \r\n On climate change, SAARC leaders reiterated the \r\nneed to redouble efforts within an expanded regional \r\nframework for environmental protection, conservation \r\nand justice. We stressed that we should contribute to \r\nrestoring harmony with nature, a part of the heritage of \r\nSouth Asia. We humans have interfered with nature too \r\nmuch for too long. We must accept that the dangers of \r\nclimate change are man-made and that its solutions, \r\ntoo, require man’s intervention. \r\n Since the promulgation of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations to save succeeding generations from \r\nthe tragedy of war, at least the major threat of \r\nintercontinental war seems to have receded. However, \r\nthe just struggle of the Palestinians for statehood \r\ncontinues.  \r\n Today, the United Nations and its peoples are \r\nconfronted with the fast-spreading menace of \r\nterrorism, which manifests itself in various forms in \r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America. The United Nations \r\nhas a grave responsibility to save today’s and \r\nsucceeding generations from that new and continuing \r\nmenace. We have been talking for long enough; it is \r\ntime for clear action in that regard. \r\n Like many other countries, Sri Lanka has not \r\nbeen spared this global menace. Exploiting perceived \r\nethnic grievances that must and can be addressed \r\nthrough political means, a well-organized terror group, \r\nthe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), engages \r\nin blatant and brutal acts of terrorism, including suicide \r\nbombings, to seek negotiating leverage, political \r\nrecognition and legitimacy. \r\n I am saddened by the loss of life and destruction \r\ncaused by the recent terrorist attack in Pakistan.  \r\n Our Government has always been ready to \r\naddress the causes of these issues and effectively \r\nimplement political and constitutional solutions to \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n3 08-51749 \r\n \r\nmeet the aspirations and respect the rights of all \r\ncommunities. What the Government would not and \r\ncould not do is to let an illegal and armed terrorist \r\ngroup, the LTTE, hold a fraction of our population, a \r\npart of the Tamil community, hostage to such terror in \r\nthe northern part of Sri Lanka and deny those people \r\ntheir democratic rights to dissent and free elections. \r\nThrough our past actions, we have proved it. \r\n The Government has therefore declared its policy \r\nof engaging in dialogue and discussion with the \r\ndemocratic leadership of the Tamil community, a \r\npeople who have lived in harmony with other Sri \r\nLankans for centuries. Today, there are Tamil leaders \r\nholding responsible ministerial posts in my \r\nGovernment. A former Attorney-General of then \r\nCeylon, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, a beloved \r\nTamil politician, had this to say at a public meeting in \r\nColombo in September 1904: “I have been to many \r\ncountries in the world. But nowhere have I seen such a \r\nfriendly race as the Sinhalese, who also uphold high \r\nmoral values.” Such was the harmony between the \r\nTamils and the Sinhalese. But a malicious group has \r\nturned all of this upside down. \r\n All successive Governments of Sri Lanka have \r\nendeavoured to resolve the problem for over 25 years, \r\nincluding through Norwegian facilitation and \r\ninternational co-chairs overseeing a so-called peace \r\nprocess that was treated with contempt by the \r\nterrorists. On each occasion that talks were held \r\nseeking peace, the terrorists of the LTTE walked out on \r\nthe flimsiest of pretexts and reverted to terrorism of the \r\nworst kind, indiscriminately targeting innocent \r\ncivilians. \r\n Our Government will only be ready to talk to that \r\nillegal armed group when it is ready to commit itself to \r\ndecommissioning its illicit weapons, dismantling its \r\nmilitary capability and returning to the democratic \r\nfold. The Government has also made it clear that the \r\nelected Government cannot and will not permit the \r\nundermining of the territorial integrity of the sovereign \r\nUnited Nations Member State of Sri Lanka and the \r\ndivision of its territory. We are clear in this message. \r\n The Government’s objective is to enable the \r\npeople to enjoy the benefits of democratic processes \r\nand to speed development activities in those areas \r\nwhere there is a heavy presence of terrorists. That \r\nwould be similar to the fast-tracking of economic \r\ndevelopment taking place in the Eastern Province of \r\nSri Lanka, where former terrorists now serve as \r\ndemocratically elected Provincial Councillors, and a \r\nformer child soldier conscripted by the LTTE is now \r\nthe elected Chief Minister, having abandoned terrorism \r\nand embraced democracy.  \r\n Significantly, the restoration of democracy in the \r\nEast of Sri Lanka was achieved in less than one year of \r\nit being freed from the clutches of terror. \r\n Our Government has also sought and received the \r\ncooperation of the United Nations, the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other \r\nagencies to help us in providing humanitarian \r\nassistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and \r\nother affected civilians. The Secretary-General’s \r\nRepresentative on IDPs, who visited Sri Lanka some \r\nyears ago, said:  \r\n“Sri Lanka presents the unusual situation of a \r\ncentral Government providing relief aid to \r\npersons under the control of the main opposition \r\ngroup. In a world replete with examples of \r\nGovernments and rebel groups using food as a \r\nweapon against civilian populations, the situation \r\nin Sri Lanka is one that deserves closer attention \r\nif not more publicity as an important precedent.” \r\n(E/CN.4/1994/44/Add.1, para. 67) \r\n The Government of Sri Lanka continues this \r\nhumanitarian policy even today, although we know that \r\nthe terrorists seize a good proportion of those \r\nhumanitarian supplies. Our supplies are not confined to \r\nfood; they extend to medicines and all other essentials \r\nas well as schools and hospitals, with teachers, doctors, \r\nnurses, and all other essential staff. That is not all; the \r\nGovernment also purchases the paddy and other \r\nfoodstuffs produced in those areas. I do not think there \r\nis any country in the world where there is a \r\nGovernment that provides such humanitarian assistance \r\nto terrorists that attack it. Our Government considers \r\nthe supply of humanitarian relief to its people as its \r\nprime responsibility. \r\n The complex situation in Sri Lanka needs to be \r\naddressed and resolved through an appropriate process \r\nof deterrent law-and-order action and patient political \r\nefforts of consensus-building. We have achieved the \r\ndifficult but essential task of building peace in the \r\nEastern Province and are confident that it can be done \r\nin the north as well. \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 4 \r\n \r\n This session of the Assembly is a good time to \r\ntake stock of progress made towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) around the globe. It is \r\nregrettable to note, as we do so, that most are behind \r\nschedule. The slowing down of global economic \r\ngrowth, financial turmoil and speculation, rising food \r\nand fuel prices and the impacts of climate change are \r\nclear obstacles. Also, sanctions imposed on the leaders \r\nof some countries, and on their leadership, based on \r\ntheir political role, following protests, are in fact, \r\ntargeted at the innocent people of those countries.  \r\n The steadily growing menace of international \r\nterrorism, with related activities such as the smuggling \r\nof illegal arms, human trafficking, drug trafficking, \r\nmoney-laundering, and business empires run by \r\nterrorist groups undoubtedly undermine the \r\nfundamentals of humanity and civilization. It appears \r\nthat steps taken by us to eradicate such illegal activities \r\nhave not been effective. This further complicates all \r\nnational and international efforts at moving towards \r\nrealizing the MDGs. Terrorism, as I have emphasized \r\nmany a time, by its very nature, pushes back even our \r\nmodest achievements. \r\n Another similar menace is threatening to devour \r\nour children, the most valuable asset of any nation. \r\nThat is the insecurity of cyberspace which has not only \r\nhelped corrupt the minds of our children but also \r\nexposes them to predators such as paedophiles, drug \r\ndealers and pornographic sites. Sri Lanka has banned \r\npornographic and similar destructive sites from being \r\navailable through Internet service providers. We are \r\nalso controlling and restricting the use of mobile \r\ntelephones for such damaging activities. That is an \r\nimportant area for world leaders to focus on. \r\n It is important that urgent and collective actions, \r\nboth short- and long-term, are taken to stem those \r\nadverse trends. Only such determined and concerted \r\nactions will enable progress to be made towards the \r\nrealization of the agreed development goals, including \r\nthe MDGs, and frustrate elements that are bent on \r\nreversing the gains made. \r\n We must deeply commit ourselves as Members of \r\nthe United Nations to forging a way forward from the \r\nlimitations not seen by those who laid the foundations \r\nfor this great institution of humankind. If we fail to do \r\nit now, future generations will curse us. \r\n I wish to conclude my address with a verse from \r\nthe Dhammapada, words from the Enlightened One: \r\n “Victory breeds hatred, \r\n The defeated live in pain. \r\n Happily the calmed live, \r\n Having set victory and defeat aside.” \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Victor Yushchenko, President of \r\nUkraine. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Ukraine. \r\nMr. Victor Yushchenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Victor Yushchenko, \r\nPresident of Ukraine, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Yushchenko (spoke in Ukrainian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): It is a great \r\nhonour for me to address the world community: the \r\nUnited Nations and its biggest representative body, the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Together with all other Member States, I am \r\ngrateful to the Macedonian representative \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim for his effective work as President of \r\nthe Assembly at its last session. \r\n I congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann \r\nof Nicaragua on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him \r\nevery success at this critical time. \r\n I am confident that we all have the same feeling. \r\nEmpty words and general discussions have had their \r\nday. We feel a cool wind in international relations that \r\ncomplicates and tempers mutual responsibilities. The \r\ndifference in temperature and pressure leads to a \r\nhurricane. Atmospheric changes in worldwide politics \r\nhave comparable effects. \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n5 08-51749 \r\n \r\n The great illusion of power becomes today’s \r\nultimate weakness and the giant vehicle of ideals and \r\nshaping forces. The principal challenge before us lies \r\nin the neglect and undermining of the standards of \r\ninternational law and foreign affairs. \r\n We see a trend towards the demolition of the \r\nglobal system, whose cornerstone is the unflagging \r\ninternational will and respect for the sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity and established boundaries of \r\nStates. \r\n Ukraine has the right to speak these words. We \r\nwere among the founders of the United Nations and \r\none of the co-authors of its Charter. \r\n We are a nation that underwent fatal trials and \r\nregained a commonwealth in a legitimate and \r\nrecognized way. The representatives of dozens of \r\nStates that share such a fate with us are here in this \r\nroom.  \r\n The latest events in the Caucasus are of the \r\nutmost concern to us. I express condolences for the \r\ntragedy suffered by each human being and each family \r\nregardless of race or allegiance  — Georgians, \r\nOssetians and Russians. Suffering does not \r\ndiscriminate among peoples. Each person has dignity \r\nand the ability to recognize truth, hypocrisy, deliberate \r\naggression, manipulation of public opinion and candid \r\nsupport for separatism.  \r\n Ukraine condemns all acts of aggression and use \r\nof force that occurred in the region. Ukraine vigorously \r\ndenounces violation of the territorial integrity and \r\ninviolability of the Georgian frontiers and the armed \r\nannexation of its territory.  \r\n Ukraine does not recognize the independence of \r\nthe self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and \r\nAbkhazia. Ukraine does not acknowledge, and \r\ncondemns, the attempt at illegitimate and separatist \r\naffirmation of the statehood of any territories. This \r\nposition is fundamental for Ukrainian foreign policy. \r\n Deviation from the United Nations principles, \r\nsuch as the use of force, and the renewal of cold-war \r\nrhetoric provoke our deep concern. Those processes \r\ncreate a potential threat both for Ukraine and for other \r\ncountries in the region. \r\n The problem cannot be solved through isolation, \r\nself-isolation or mutual accusations. There is only one \r\nway out. With common and good will we are to \r\nconsolidate our values and the aims contained in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. \r\n With full responsibility for peace and security, we \r\nneed to stop disturbances by separatist spirits, which \r\ncan turn into misfortune for the instigators themselves. \r\nIt is essential to reject blackmailing and threatening \r\nvocabulary. Ukraine rejects pressure of any kind \r\nregarding ways to ensure its own security and to \r\ndetermine membership in collective security structures. \r\nSuch attempts at infringement are short-sighted and \r\ncounterproductive. \r\n We call for the strengthening of the role of the \r\nSecurity Council, the only body with exclusive \r\nauthority in issues of global peace and security. We \r\nneed its decisions to be balanced and its actions to be \r\neffective. \r\n Ukraine supports all efforts aimed at peaceful \r\nsettlement and unblocking of the situation on the South \r\nCaucasus and will fully cooperate in that process. We \r\nwill continue our peacekeeping activities firmly and \r\nvigorously, and we will participate in the settlement of \r\nthe protracted conflicts on the basis of respect for the \r\nprinciples of sovereignty, territorial integrity, \r\ninviolability of borders, human rights, freedoms and \r\ndignity. \r\n The world is waiting for a confident and positive \r\nresponse from the United Nations. The world needs \r\nrenewed confidence in our collective efforts and strict \r\nadherence to the norms of international law and to the \r\nUnited Nations Organization. \r\n Our national agenda is concordant with the main \r\nchallenges facing the international community. As a \r\ncountry possessing the best black-earth soil in the \r\nworld, Ukraine is going to contribute tangibly to the \r\ncommon work on solving the global food crisis. \r\n We plan to consolidate all possible efforts to \r\nrealize an effective and just energy policy. The \r\nprinciples that should be implemented are mutual \r\nbenefit, the continuous fulfilment of obligations and \r\nthe inadmissibility of any energy pressure. \r\n We reinforce our call for more active global \r\ncooperation in the sphere of the environment. Ukraine \r\nputs forward an initiative to develop a binding \r\nframework agreement — a World Environmental \r\nConstitution — and to establish a single-structure \r\nsystem for ecological and environmental protection, \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 6 \r\n \r\nwith relevant authority and mechanisms in the United \r\nNations. \r\n We plan to revitalize efforts in the fight against \r\nHIV/AIDS and other dangerous diseases. This problem \r\nremains highly topical for Ukraine. \r\n Undoubtedly, Ukraine will continue to keep an \r\neye on the whole range of common tasks and \r\nchallenges, from poverty problems to trafficking in \r\nhuman beings, international terrorism and proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction. \r\n The line we follow is clear. Our policy is based \r\non democratic values, open dialogue with all partners \r\nof different cultures, and unconditional respect for \r\nfundamental human rights. I have the honour to appeal \r\nto the world community with a request for solidarity. \r\n This year Ukraine will mark the seventy-fifth \r\nanniversary of the Great Famine — the Holodomor, \r\nwhich took the lives of about 10 million of our \r\ncompatriots. Our intention is not directed against any \r\npeople or State. We neither overstate nor understate our \r\nsorrow. The tenor of hunger in Ukraine was oriented \r\ntowards genocide and was accompanied by the total \r\nelimination of the national elite, the public leadership \r\nand the priesthood. The goal was to overpower a nation \r\nof millions, because, according to the regime, there \r\nwere too many people to displace to Siberia. \r\n It is important that our steps encourage other \r\ncountries of the former Soviet Union to find the truth. \r\nWe share the pain of all the people affected — \r\nRussians, Belarusians, Kazakhs and dozens of other \r\nnations. We invite a joint commemoration of each \r\nnational tragedy and no toleration of new attempts to \r\ncreate a heroic aureole around Stalin and his regime. \r\nWe have invaluable examples of mutual understanding \r\nwith Poland, Hungary and other States. Honest and \r\nsincere memories about the past have not split us but \r\nhave united us. It is our aspiration that memories of the \r\nvictims of the Holodomor and other crimes of \r\ntotalitarian regimes will prevent the world from \r\nrepeating such catastrophes. \r\n I believe in our ability to respond effectively to \r\nevery challenge the world is facing. Ukraine is \r\ndetermined to work on this. We will act as dedicated \r\npartners. Everything is in our hands. I believe in our \r\npower, will and wisdom. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Ukraine for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Victor Yushchenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of  \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay. \r\nMr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Fernando Lugo \r\nMéndez, President of the Republic of Paraguay, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Lugo Méndez (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the nation of Paraguay, I wish to express to \r\nyou, Mr. President, my most sincere congratulations on \r\nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session. I wish you every success. \r\n This is a place where every year the Powers of \r\nthe world write history that should transcend mere \r\nlofty political prose and be a tool for verse — the \r\npoetry of eliminating hunger, embracing equity among \r\nnations and building a better world for all. I believe \r\nthat, one day, these enormous buildings — which were \r\nbuilt with the aim of preventing war — will be \r\nincreasingly dedicated to providing bread, eradicating \r\nhunger and malnutrition throughout the world and \r\nsaving millions of lives from disease and violence of \r\nall kinds. \r\n After 61 years of single-party Government and \r\nfor the first time in my country’s political history, a \r\nparty has come to power via the ballot — the \r\nappropriate means under the democratic code. \r\nParaguay is soaring on the winds of democratic change \r\nthat are blowing through the region. The new \r\nGovernment that I represent is an unequivocal response \r\nto the many needs that have arisen and opportunities \r\nthat have been lost in recent decades. This year, \r\ncitizens voted for greater social justice, to halt the \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n7 08-51749 \r\n \r\nmassive destruction of the environment, and to combat \r\nthe corruption, shady dealings and favouritism of a \r\nweakened and opportunistic State that delayed the \r\nimplementation of a sustainable and inclusive \r\ndevelopment strategy for years. \r\n The new administration represents the end of our \r\n19-year transition to democracy and has embarked on \r\nreform of the State and the economy. It has encouraged \r\ncitizens to participate in the political decision-making \r\nprocess. We understand that political and economic \r\nstability is not more important than social stability. \r\nThat is why we are committed to applying social \r\npolicies to combat extreme poverty. We cannot hope \r\nfor sustainable development when the market and the \r\nState deny opportunities to the weakest, nor is it \r\npossible to sustain democracy when the vast majority \r\nare excluded from enjoying economic benefits. We \r\ntherefore believe in economic growth with social \r\nequity and in environmental responsibility as the very \r\nheart of our public policies.  \r\n Paraguay has opened a door of opportunity to the \r\nworld. Two weeks ago, before we had come to the end \r\nof our first month in power, my Government launched \r\na major assault on illicit Government management. The \r\nmafias that enjoyed shameful and excessive wealth \r\nthrough their influence on public power are enduring \r\nthe worst moment of their history in Paraguay. We do \r\nnot rule out the possibility of stripping the ill-gotten \r\ngains from those whom scandalous wealth made \r\nmillionaires overnight and are now digging in their \r\nheels and even hatching specific plots to foment \r\npolitical and economic instability. The political \r\nholdovers in Paraguay still cling to a fascistic style of \r\npatronage, to which my Government has responded \r\nfirmly but calmly. We will show zero tolerance for any \r\nanti-democratic activity and close our doors to all \r\nblackmail and any attempt to revive outdated models of \r\naccess to power.  \r\n The new Government, which came to power on \r\n15 August, has been proactive in a historic show of \r\nsolidarity with the democratic peoples of Latin \r\nAmerica and in its rapid response in defence of \r\ndemocratically elected Governments, such as in the \r\nsister Republic of Bolivia, in the context of the Union \r\nof South American Nations. We also thank those \r\nbrotherly countries that stood with us in the face of \r\npotential instability and have expressed their concern \r\nfor and solidarity with the Paraguayan process.  \r\n The only way to build economic relations has \r\nbeen through a market mechanism which sold Latin \r\nAmerica on the financial speculation of the 1980s that \r\nsunk our continent in debt, sidelined the role of the \r\nState and widened the gap between rich and poor. That \r\nmechanism, which was forced upon us, has proven to \r\nbe wrong-headed and very costly for our peoples on \r\nthe social level. \r\n Today, we are seeing a financial crisis in \r\ndeveloped economies as a result of immoral \r\nspeculation that also affects the well-being of peoples. \r\nThe sole motive behind such speculation is the desire \r\nfor greater wealth that privatizes benefits and \r\nsocializes the costs of unregulated market economies.  \r\n Paraguay is in favour of strengthening the \r\nGeneral Assembly and restoring its mandated attributes \r\nand functions under the United Nations Charter. As the \r\nmost representative body of the Organization, the \r\nAssembly must become a true world parliament in \r\nwhich the major issues affecting humankind can be \r\ndiscussed and are not relegated to other bodies whose \r\ndecision-making process is confined to a small number \r\nof countries that often fail to take the opinion of the \r\nmajority of the membership into account. \r\n Paraguay believes that the problems that have led \r\nto climate change call for short- and long-term world \r\nresponses in line with the most recent scientific \r\nadvances and applied in a fashion that is compatible \r\nwith the economic and social development of each \r\ncountry affected. Countries with economies in \r\ndevelopment suffer in particular from vulnerability and \r\nisolation as they attempt to enter the globalized market.  \r\n Ironically, it is the poorest — those who are the \r\nleast responsible for climate change — who suffer \r\nmost from its consequences. When it comes to major \r\nresponsibility, we often note the irony of conservation \r\nmeasures imposed on areas of the world that are \r\nalready suffering from poverty and exclusion. At the \r\nsame time, we note the sustained indifference and \r\nlimited capacities for self-criticism in the political \r\nrealms that manage the fate of the world. That is \r\nprecisely where the principal industrial and \r\nconsumption phenomena arise, creating societies that, \r\ndue to the irresponsibility of their leaders, persist in \r\ndepleting their own resources, their own lands, their \r\nown dreams and their own lives.  \r\n Paraguay therefore calls on countries to recognize \r\ntheir shared but differentiated responsibilities. We \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 8 \r\n \r\nstress the need for all members of the international \r\ncommunity to act on their pledges. The same is true in \r\ndetermining political and economic responsibility for \r\nthe deterioration of the world — the irreplaceable \r\nhome of humankind.  \r\n At the same high level as our concern for the \r\nstructural and immediate causes of poverty is our \r\nconcern for the situation of indigenous peoples. Not \r\nonly are they poor and excluded, but in many regions \r\nof the continent they have not reached a level of civic \r\ninclusion that permits them to be involved in decision-\r\nmaking processes. In many cases, those who uphold a \r\ndiscourse of inclusion are intolerant when our \r\nindigenous brothers take on political leadership roles.  \r\n The indigenous nations of Latin America are not \r\nthe ancient creation of our continent, but the most vital \r\npotential for political action, which we must respect, \r\npromote and include. If we did not, that would be an \r\nintolerable attack against our own civilization. America \r\nmust wake up in the face of all of that.  \r\n We need to account for the old debt, which began \r\nto accrue in the filthy bowels of the slave ships and \r\ncontinued to grow with every gesture of disdain \r\ntowards any indigenous attempt to have their say, their \r\nvote, their dreams and their plans for the land that at \r\none time was theirs alone. Recognizing indigenous \r\npeoples as participants in the political and participatory \r\nprocesses of the State is still a pending issue, and it is a \r\nsad expression of intolerance in many regions.  \r\n In Paraguay, we have begun a process of \r\ntransparency that has no precedents. The media are \r\nplaying a fundamental role in this process. They were \r\nvery proactive in combating corruption in Paraguay, \r\nand today, because of their questioning of our \r\nmanagement, they are working at a high standard to \r\ngenerate ongoing self-criticism. As we guarantee the \r\nmost unconditional support for enlightened \r\nmanagement in journalism, self-expression and the \r\nright to access information, we seek to open up better \r\nhorizons for the communications and education media, \r\nwhich had always been persecuted or dismissed as of \r\nno importance in our country.  \r\n We must work to build a more just world through \r\nsocial engineering. It is time to go beyond statements \r\nthat are incapable of showing clear signs of progress in \r\nthe fight against poverty and exclusion. The world’s \r\nforums for debate and reflection cause strain and risk \r\nlosing credibility if they do not lead to actions that can \r\ndraw a smile on the faces of unemployed youths who \r\nhave no future. It is sad to see migrants who wander in \r\nan incessant exodus of biblical proportions, or to see \r\nwomen who are relegated to a secondary position by a \r\nculture and a civilization unable to recover the original \r\ndignity that belongs to them, who give life, affection, \r\ncreativity and courage to change the world.  \r\n We need to highlight food security by ensuring \r\nnot only space and opportunities for self-managed \r\nproduction, but also its cultural, sovereign and national \r\nidentity dimensions. We are calling for greater, better \r\nand more timely international assistance for \r\nagricultural and fishing production in order to ensure \r\nincreasing food production without destroying the \r\nenvironment and avoiding the current rise in food \r\nprices. Those costs end up punishing primarily the \r\nmost vulnerable groups. On the global scale, we call \r\nupon nations that are heading huge agricultural projects \r\nto recognize the tribulations of small local producers, \r\nwho often are crushed by new models that are \r\narrogantly imposed on them.  \r\n The question of landlocked developing countries \r\nis a fundamental issue in Paraguay’s foreign policy. \r\nThe disadvantages and asymmetries that that \r\ngeographic situation has generated and continues to \r\ngenerate can be remedied only through international \r\nrecognition and the granting of special, differentiated \r\ntreatment in the country’s insertion into a globalized \r\nworld.  \r\n Paraguay believes that the upcoming midterm \r\nreview meeting of the Almaty Programme of Action is \r\nextremely important. It is an opportunity to consolidate \r\nachievements made so far and to ensure greater \r\ncommitment from international bodies and from more \r\ndeveloped countries. Working together in a coordinated \r\nmatter will help landlocked developing countries \r\novercome their limitations.  \r\n In Paraguay, large corporations — the Itaipu with \r\nBrazil and the Yasyreta with Argentina — offer \r\nabundant and available electric energy. Our \r\nGovernment is committed to prioritizing and using \r\nthese renewable resources for economic and social \r\ndevelopment of the country in such a manner as to \r\ncomplement our efforts to create better sources of \r\nwork, more production and a reduction of poverty. We \r\nare operating in a framework of increasingly fluid \r\ndialogue with our brotherly countries, with which we \r\nshare those power stations, so that the benefits can \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n9 08-51749 \r\n \r\nrepair the social debts deserving our attention and \r\nbecome true factors for economic growth. \r\n Taking into account the upcoming review of the \r\nfinancing for development process, which will take \r\nplace in Doha at the end of the year, Paraguay calls for \r\nthe international community to mobilize its external \r\nresources to provide decisive support for the \r\ndevelopment of small economies. That is a priority \r\nboth for both international financial bodies and  \r\ndeveloped economies. We would like the call for just \r\ninternational trade to become a true impetus for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Many of our countries have communities in \r\nvarious places in the world. Just like Europeans who in \r\nthe past century came to America, today many friends \r\nand families from our regions seek better prospects in \r\nthe countries of Europe and in North America. We call \r\nupon the humanitarian, brotherly, hospitable sense — \r\nthe same that our continent showed in the past in \r\nsharing its scarce resources — in nations that today \r\ntake in our migrants, who are dreaming of having a job \r\nand the right to a dignified life, far from their \r\ncountries. The human dimension of that drama calls for \r\na frank dialogue with receiving countries to find a \r\nsolution to this new drama of globalization. \r\n The Republic of Paraguay believes that, although \r\nprogress has been made towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), we cannot deny the \r\nexistence of the inequalities that persist in the \r\ndeveloped world. Millions of people continue to live in \r\nextreme poverty, a situation that is worsened by the \r\nsudden increase in the cost of food and fuel and the \r\nconsequences of climate change. \r\n In order to achieve the MDGs by 2015, we are \r\ncalling for strengthening the combined efforts of \r\nGovernments, civil society organizations and the \r\nprivate sector in the context of a global alliance for \r\nstronger and more effective development, increasing \r\nofficial development assistance for the most vulnerable \r\neconomies in particular.  \r\n We must not forget the thousands of millions of \r\nhuman beings worldwide who live below the poverty \r\nline. In our Latin American subcontinent, poverty has \r\nrisen to 44 per cent of the population. In Paraguay, \r\n35.6 per cent of our citizens suffer from this scourge, \r\nand of those almost 20 per cent live below the line of \r\nextreme poverty. Malnutrition now affects four out of \r\nevery 100 Paraguayan children. This situation is \r\nunacceptable and demands a radical change in the \r\napproach taken to combat this state of affairs. The most \r\ndisadvantaged, those who remain in the sidelines of \r\ndevelopment are the ones we must listen to, and \r\nalleviating their suffering must be our priority.  \r\n Today more than ever, Paraguay requires \r\ninternational cooperation in achieving its socio-\r\neconomic priorities, in developing and strengthening \r\nits institutions and in providing preferential attention to \r\nthe most vulnerable sectors. We hope that the opening \r\nof developing countries will favour the most \r\ndisadvantaged and that the same restrictions demanded \r\nin the development of more developed economies will \r\nnot be applied.  \r\n We believe that this will be a vital tool for \r\nstrengthening developing countries. That is why \r\nParaguay signed the constitution of the Bank of the \r\nSouth and will continue to support the strengthening of \r\nthat institution so that it can meet its objectives of \r\nfinancing the balanced and stable economic and social \r\ndevelopment of its member States, promoting \r\nmacroeconomic stability and strengthening integration \r\nin order to set the foundation for regional and financial \r\nautonomy. However, that does not mean that we no \r\nlonger require the support, resources and cooperation \r\nof the most developed countries for the two modes of \r\ncooperation are complementary for development.  \r\n Paraguay believes that the international \r\ncommunity should ensure that the mobilization of \r\nexternal resources becomes a priority for international \r\nfinancial bodies and the developed economies. To that \r\nend, we must regain the level of expansion of official \r\ndevelopment assistance, which in recent years has been \r\nshrinking in a disturbing fashion. \r\n Terrorism must be eradicated from the face of the \r\nEarth. There is nothing more dangerous to the unity of \r\ncivilization than terrorism as a fact of daily life: the \r\nterrorism that kills children through hunger; the \r\nterrorism of weapons anywhere; the terrorism that \r\naffects children in my country who die because of toxic \r\nproduce; the terrorism that killed our brothers in the \r\nTwin Towers, which will continue to kill as long as war \r\nremains a business for a few and fanaticism continues \r\nto cloud our hearts. \r\n I know that love is a word not frequently used in \r\npolitical discourse, but there is no other way to rebuild \r\na world so disfigured by hate. We must not forget \r\nindividuals who, for various physical and mental \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 10 \r\n \r\nreasons, have special capacities. Those are our dearest \r\nbrothers and sisters in a world that often excludes those \r\nwho cannot compete in terms of physical strength or \r\nthought. We must create conditions to enable them to \r\nshare in our everyday lives without suffering the \r\nburden of exclusion or indifference. Our efforts to \r\nsupport that sector of the population need not be \r\nextraordinary but should be carried out in daily actions, \r\nrich in sharing and informed by an awareness of \r\nbrotherhood and nature.  \r\n In this globalized world where things happen so \r\nquickly and communication is immediate, we see \r\nclearly its greatest technological advancements, its \r\npowerful financial architecture and its scientific plans \r\nto colonize the universe, but, we have to ask ourselves, \r\nwhere has the human being been left in all of this?  \r\n Men and women must always remain at the centre \r\nof that scenario. The only thing that will save us from \r\npost-modern savagery is if they recover their place \r\nfrom which no one should ever have been exiled. \r\nHumanity is the only value shared, without a single \r\ndifference, by a child dying of hunger in a developing \r\ncountry and a child who eats breakfast every day in a \r\ndeveloped country.  \r\n Paraguay is a small country in the world, but it \r\nbelieves in friendship. That is why we have set 30 July \r\nas the Day of Friendship. We hope that this initiative \r\nwill resonate in various regions of the world and that \r\nfriendship, with its values and its principles, sooner \r\nrather than later will replace the hostility which is so \r\npresent in our times. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay for the statement he has just \r\nmade.  \r\nMr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Aníbal António Cavaco Silva, \r\nPresident of the Portuguese Republic \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nPortuguese Republic. \r\nMr. Aníbal António Cavaco Silva, President of the \r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Aníbal António \r\nCavaco Silva, President of the Portuguese Republic, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Cavaco Silva: (spoke in Portuguese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): \r\nMr. President, I wish you all success for your tenure in \r\noffice.  \r\n Guaranteeing international peace and security as \r\nwell as the sustainable development of our peoples is \r\nour shared responsibility. The way we carry it out will \r\ndetermine our common destiny. The centrality of the \r\nUnited Nations has never been so clear. The United \r\nNations will be what we, as sovereign and equal \r\nMember States, want it to be. \r\n We live in a time of historic acceleration, a time \r\nof great opportunities but also of challenges on a \r\nglobal scale. Global challenges imply a collective \r\nresponsibility. The United Nations is the forum that \r\nbest embodies that collective responsibility. That is \r\nalso why I strongly support the statement made by the \r\nPresident of the French Republic, current President of \r\nthe Council of the European Union. \r\n In a globalized and interdependent world, only \r\nstrong multilateral institutions can promote the \r\nfundamental values of peace, democracy, human rights \r\nand sustainable development. Portugal is committed to \r\nsupporting effective multilateralism based on a \r\ncohesive and efficient United Nations. \r\n Our words cannot be empty rhetoric. Therefore \r\nwe must be consistent and put into practice the values \r\nand principles we defend. Our actions must be based \r\non very clear assumptions. First, we must make every \r\neffort to ensure that the United Nations has the means \r\nnecessary to fulfil its mission, and we must contribute \r\nto the achievement of the mandates with which we \r\nentrust it. \r\n Secondly, we must ensure broader representation \r\nin the United Nations bodies and make their actions \r\nmore transparent. Is it reasonable to continue having a \r\nSecurity Council without reforming its working \r\nmethods, when countries such as Brazil and India have \r\nno permanent seat and when Africa is not permanently \r\nrepresented? We surely do not think so and are open to \r\nthe possibility of broader solutions.  \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n11 08-51749 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, we must guarantee the fulfilment of the \r\ndeclarations on human rights approved by all of us. \r\nThe Organization must bear in mind that the ultimate \r\nbeneficiaries of its actions are not States as such, but \r\nthe citizens and peoples that compose them. \r\n Portugal has been committed to this common \r\neffort — first, by participating in peacekeeping \r\noperations. I would like to commend the many \r\nthousands of Portuguese who have participated in over \r\n20 missions led by the United Nations and those who \r\ncurrently are taking part in missions in Afghanistan, \r\nthe Central African Republic, Chad, Kosovo, Lebanon \r\nand Timor-Leste. \r\n This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, and I would \r\nlike to pay tribute to all of the Blue Helmets. In \r\nparticular I pay tribute to the memory of all of those, \r\nincluding Portuguese nationals, who have made the \r\nultimate sacrifice for the ideals of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n Africa must remain a priority. That belief led us, \r\ntogether with our African partners, to hold the Cairo \r\nand Lisbon summits between the European Union (EU) \r\nand Africa, which began to further the dialogue \r\nbetween the two continents. The shared principles, the \r\ncommitments undertaken and the EU-Africa Joint \r\nStrategy illustrate a renewed partnership based on \r\ncooperation in areas such as peace and security, \r\ndevelopment, good governance and human rights, trade \r\nand regional integration. Peace, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, access to education and health care and \r\nthe integration of African economies in the \r\ninternational markets are essential objectives in \r\nbuilding a more just, peaceful and balanced \r\ninternational order. Accordingly, we must support the \r\nefforts of the African nations to achieve those \r\nobjectives. \r\n In that context, I would like to congratulate the \r\nAngolan people for the civic-minded manner in which \r\nthey conducted their recent electoral process. The \r\nlegislative elections had a profound bearing on the \r\nconsolidation of democracy in Angola, with important \r\nregional political repercussions. \r\n I also welcome the political agreement in \r\nZimbabwe, which we hope will mark a new period of \r\nnational reconciliation as well as political and \r\neconomic development. \r\n I wish also to congratulate Guinea-Bissau on the \r\nanniversary of its independence. Guinea-Bissau is one \r\nof the States Members of the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), from which it \r\nhas received strong political support. The CPLP has \r\nundertaken increasing responsibilities as an operational \r\npartner of the regional organizations to which its \r\nmember States belong, such as the European Union and \r\nthe African Union, and of global organizations such as \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n The recent Lisbon summit of the CPLP, at which \r\nPortugal took over the presidency of the Community, \r\nconfirmed its members’ determination to promote \r\npeace, democracy, human rights and development. It \r\nalso led to the definition of a common strategy of \r\ninternational assertiveness based on our shared asset: \r\nthe Portuguese language — the fifth most spoken \r\nlanguage in the world, connecting nations and peoples \r\nin five continents. This assertiveness should lead to the \r\nincreased use of Portuguese as an official or working \r\nlanguage of international organizations. \r\n Recently, Portugal also assumed the presidency \r\nof the Community of Democracies. Very soon, we will \r\nbe presiding over the Ibero-American Summit — a \r\ngenuine reference point for political cooperation based \r\non shared cultures and values. We are honoured by \r\nthose mandates, which we intend to exercise with \r\ndetermination and confidence. \r\n Portugal believes that the natural vocation of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations to bring together peoples, \r\ncultures and religions will be instrumental in \r\nestablishing a world where dialogue prevails over \r\nconflict and where tolerance, respect for cultural \r\ndiversity and individual identity, and mutual \r\nunderstanding overcome built-up tensions. We \r\ntherefore resolutely support the Implementation Plan of \r\nthe High Representative of the Secretary-General. \r\n Seven years have passed since New York suffered \r\none of the most infamous acts the world has witnessed \r\nin our time. Although much has been done since then, \r\nterrorism continues to be a threat. The implementation \r\nof the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is \r\nfundamental to success in combating that common \r\nenemy. In that regard, it is crucial to respect human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, the promotion of \r\nwhich contributes to preventing terrorism. \r\n Hunger and extreme poverty are other, more \r\ninsidious but equally destructive common enemies. \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 12 \r\n \r\nMuch has also been said in that connection, and some \r\nmeasures have been taken. However, much more is \r\nrequired. We reiterate our unwavering support for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Portugal, which is \r\ncontributing to the limit of its capabilities, is directing \r\nmost of its development aid to Africa, where the levels \r\nof poverty are most striking.  \r\n We are pleased to note the establishment of the \r\nHigh-level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis. \r\nCombating hunger and poverty requires a strengthened \r\nglobal partnership in which the United Nations and the \r\nBretton Woods institutions have a central role to play.  \r\n Ensuring sustainable development requires that \r\nwe confront the challenges posed by climate change \r\ntogether. Failure to act now will result in an \r\nirreversible legacy for future generations, as shown by \r\nthe last progress report of the Intergovernmental Panel \r\non Climate Change. In that common effort, we must \r\nsupport those who are most vulnerable to the effects of \r\nclimate change, such as small island developing States \r\nand least developed countries.  \r\n Oceans, seas, islands and coastal areas, which are \r\nvital for human life and economic prosperity, deserve \r\nour utmost attention. It is therefore important that we \r\njoin efforts to ensure that negotiations are completed \r\nby December next year on a global and transparent \r\nagreement on a post-2012 climate regime. \r\n Economic development is not an end in itself; it \r\nis a means towards the progress of humankind and the \r\naffirmation of human rights. Portugal has been the \r\ndriving force behind the draft optional protocol to the \r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights, which the Assembly will be called \r\nupon to adopt. It is our opinion that the draft protocol \r\nrepresents a landmark in the promotion of democracy \r\nthat will enable us to properly celebrate the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Let us always bear in \r\nmind that the dignity of human beings is not \r\nnegotiable. \r\n I would now like to refer to the humanitarian \r\nsituation of refugees. Portugal acknowledges the \r\nremarkable work carried out by the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. We must continue \r\nour collective efforts. In that regard, my country has \r\nresponded to the need by tripling its refugee quota. \r\n We are the United Nations. Its destiny is in our \r\nhands. The success of the Organization is closely \r\nlinked to its capacity for regeneration and increased \r\ndemocratization, representation and effectiveness. I \r\ntherefore wish to commend the consensus in the \r\nGeneral Assembly as regards the Security Council \r\nreform process, which should enable intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to begin shortly. Portugal is honoured to \r\nbe directly associated with that outcome.  \r\n In 2000, Portugal submitted its candidacy for a \r\nnon-permanent seat in the Security Council for the \r\nbiennium 2011-2012. Our candidacy must be \r\nconsidered in the light of the principles and values of \r\nthe United Nations that we have long defended and \r\nwhich are enshrined in the Portuguese Constitution. We \r\nstand for service to peace and stability, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and human rights. We also believe in the \r\ncentral role of the Organization in pursuing those \r\ngoals. We stand for equal representation for those \r\nStates that constitute the majority in this house because \r\nwe believe that that is the best way to guarantee a \r\nsense of justice, which is essential if decisions are to be \r\naccepted by all. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Portuguese Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Aníbal António Cavaco Silva, President of the \r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana. \r\nMr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. John Agyekum \r\nKufuor, President of the Republic of Ghana, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Kufuor: Let me take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on your very \r\ninspiring statement yesterday (see A/63/PV.5). Its \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n13 08-51749 \r\n \r\nvision and compassion should provide a framework for \r\nthe deliberations of the General Assembly into the \r\nfuture. \r\n I should also like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his unequivocal resolve to use his tenure to provide \r\naccountable leadership to this global institution. His \r\ncall for increased support from all Members in \r\nrestructuring and streamlining the Secretariat he leads \r\nto ensure more flexible, efficient and effective tackling \r\nof the many global challenges confronting humankind \r\nis timely and must be heeded. \r\n The unmistakable fact of our time is that the \r\nworld is in a state of flux with unmatched challenges \r\naptly described yesterday by you, Mr. President, as a \r\nconfluence of large-scale interrelated crises. That is \r\nbefuddling all nations, strong and weak, rich and poor; \r\nbut, as you and others have also observed, there are \r\ntremendous opportunities as well. Examples of the \r\nchallenges that practically all previous speakers have \r\nalluded to include the phenomenon of climate change \r\nand its attendant snow-melts, tsunamis, floods and \r\ndroughts; the difficult-to-explain turbulence in the \r\ncrude oil market; the soaring prices of food; the \r\nupheavals in the world financial market; the massive \r\ntrafficking in drugs and weapons; and the spate of \r\nharrowing acts of terrorism in many parts of the world. \r\nWhile some of those problems are natural, many of \r\nthem are man-made. \r\n On the other hand, the advent of information and \r\ncommunication technologies is effecting magical \r\nchanges in awareness and making time, space and \r\nboundaries virtually irrelevant to human interactivity \r\naround the world. Discoveries in medicine are \r\nimproving the quality of life and life expectancy. Fast \r\ntransportation, dramatic feats in engineering and \r\nbioscience technologies with the promise of turning \r\neven deserts into productive land are unleashing \r\nunimaginable wealth among nations and individuals. \r\nCollectively, those opportunities are diffusing power \r\naround the world, to such an extent as to negate any \r\nidea of a few nations having hegemonic sway in human \r\naffairs. \r\n Indeed, the era of the explosion of knowledge can \r\nbe said to be fulfilling the biblical saying that \r\nhumankind has been created in the image of God. \r\nHumankind is increasingly showing limitless creativity, \r\nwhich inspires a vision that it is indeed capable of \r\novercoming the challenges of our time. However, the \r\nproblem is one of whether we will curb our self-\r\ncentredness, greed, bigotry and petty inhumanities to \r\nallow for the sharing of the outcomes of that creativity. \r\nLeft to our individual nations, the peoples of the world \r\nwill not be high-minded enough. The main challenge \r\nthen becomes how the various peoples of the world \r\nwill accept their common humanity as the centrepiece \r\nof their endeavours. \r\n There must be leadership, for which the \r\nOrganization seems to have been created. The founding \r\nfathers must have instinctively believed that, with time, \r\nthe Organization would evolve into a global \r\nGovernment. For even as there were marked \r\ngeopolitical considerations in the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Organization was also imbued with \r\na powerful streak of morality. With time, the moral \r\nstreak has been steadily overcoming the geopolitical \r\ndimension. That perception is what must drive the \r\nentire membership to accept the call for reform of this \r\nglobal institution and its agencies so as to make them \r\naccountable to Members and, in turn, make Members \r\naccept their authority and direction. \r\n Indeed, the United Nations is the only \r\nOrganization in the world with the potential to \r\ncommand respect across the board. Under its auspices, \r\nstrong and rich nations alike are showing increasing \r\ntendencies to share knowledge and finance resources \r\nwith the weak and poor. Fellow-feeling in international \r\nrelations is also deepening. It is my belief that it is \r\nthrough the Organization that the world will eventually \r\nachieve peace, stability and prosperity, following the \r\nmenacing flux that engulfs all of us now. \r\n It is the same moral streak embedded in the \r\nUnited Nations that is propelling the development of \r\nthe various regional blocs around the world. In the case \r\nof Africa, dramatic improvements have been made in \r\nthe last decade and a half. The African Union’s Peer \r\nReview Mechanism demonstrates the great resolve of \r\nAfrican nations to adhere to the rule of law and good \r\ngovernance. It is noteworthy that, as of now, close to a \r\nmajority of the membership of the Union has signed up \r\nfor review. It is also significant that many more African \r\nleaders are today acceding to power through the ballot \r\nbox. \r\n Meanwhile, under the auspices of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, Africa is trying \r\nto pool resources among its members, in partnership \r\nwith others outside the continent, to exploit its huge \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 14 \r\n \r\npotential and to develop its markets and its energy, \r\ntelecommunication, transportation and agriculture \r\nsectors, among others. That is the way to solve the \r\nmany problems of poverty, illiteracy, disease, \r\nignorance and conflict. It is Africa’s initiative to \r\nmainstream itself into globalization, and is receiving \r\nthe support of the international community. Evidence \r\nof that includes the many joint conferences held with \r\nJapan, China, Brazil and India, as well as Africa’s old \r\nallies in Europe and North America. \r\n While we appreciate the support from our \r\ndevelopment partners, I must say that there is still \r\nroom for improvement, especially as regards the \r\ncontinent’s efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The various existing forms of \r\nassistance are uncoordinated and insufficiently \r\nsubstantial to achieve the Goals by the target date of \r\n2015. In that regard, the Secretary-General’s call for \r\nreview and quick delivery of support is timely. As \r\nobserved in the Accra Accord of the twelfth United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, the \r\nwhole idea of aid is to empower beneficiary countries \r\nto stand on their own feet and to become effective \r\npartners in the global market, from which neither rich \r\nnor poor countries can abstain, given the increasing \r\ninterdependence of the world. \r\n In January 2001, I was sworn into office as \r\nPresident of Ghana on a liberal democratic \r\nConstitution with the same strong streak of morality \r\nthat I see in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nConstitution acknowledges the centrality of humankind \r\nin all endeavours; hence the provisions for respect for \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law, gender balance, \r\naccountability and transparency in governance.  \r\n But, in 2001 the national economy was in bad \r\nshape and Ghana had to sign up for the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) in \r\norder to access funds for various reconstruction \r\nprojects for which credit lines were difficult to come \r\nby. With national determination and great discipline, \r\nthe HIPC completion point was achieved in record time \r\nto earn debt forgiveness of about $8 billion from \r\nbilateral and multilateral creditors. That success has led \r\nto increased inflows of domestic and foreign \r\ninvestment that have enabled the Government to \r\nlaunch, among other social services, a free and \r\ncompulsory universal basic education programme and \r\nsubstantial developments in both the second-cycle and \r\ntertiary levels education.  \r\n In the health sector, the first-ever national health \r\ninsurance scheme, including free maternal care, has \r\nalso begun in Ghana. Concurrently, heavy investments \r\nare being made in infrastructure in the transportation, \r\nenergy and telecommunications sectors in anticipation \r\nof accelerated growth in the economy. Meanwhile, a \r\nprocess to modernize the country’s agriculture through \r\nmechanization has begun to improve the welfare of the \r\nmore than 60 per cent of society that is rural and \r\ndepends on the sector for its livelihood. \r\n By those policies, among others, the nation is \r\nnow in sight of attaining its ambitious vision of middle \r\nincome status by 2015, which is also the target date for \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Those \r\ndevelopments have been crowned by the discovery of \r\noil in commercial quantities, which the Government is \r\ndetermined to make a blessing for the whole nation of \r\nGhana, rather than a curse. \r\n That is the Ghana story as my term of office \r\ncomes to a close at the end of this year. The moral I \r\nglean from the story is that development in freedom is \r\npossible. In other words, accelerated national \r\ndevelopment and good governance, including respect \r\nfor fundamental human rights, are not mutually \r\nexclusive. Indeed, good governance should hasten \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President \r\nof the Republic of Chile \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile. \r\nMrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Michelle \r\nBachelet Jeria, President of the Republic of Chile, and \r\nto invite her to address the Assembly. \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n15 08-51749 \r\n \r\n President Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): \r\nEight years ago, representatives of all the countries of \r\nthe planet met in the General Assembly Hall to adopt \r\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) — a text that is one of the broadest \r\nand most explicit agreements ever drafted by the \r\ninternational community on the subject of \r\ndevelopment, well-being and quality of life. The \r\nDeclaration set a series of very precise standards in the \r\nfight against hunger and poverty, education, health, \r\ngender equality, environment and cooperation, stating \r\nfor each the minimum to which nations should commit \r\nthemselves.  \r\n The world at that time announced the civilizing \r\nmission to which it aspired and identified the \r\ninescapable challenges and unavoidable tasks for any \r\nGovernment and for the international community. It \r\ndefined a real ethical vision for the leaders of the \r\nnations. The world has changed since then, however. \r\n We have witnessed, sometimes tragically, the \r\nemergence or reappearance of various problems of \r\nglobal significance, such as climate change, terrorism \r\nor the food crisis. At the same time, the \r\ninterdependence of economies and communications has \r\nbecome even greater over the past eight years, which \r\nhas undoubtedly created many opportunities but also \r\ngreater risks and inequities. \r\n In that changing context, we have witnessed \r\noutstanding progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in many countries of the world, but \r\nwe have also witnessed many regrettable setbacks. \r\nWorld events over the past year give us much food for \r\nthought that will allow us to act decisively. The \r\noptimism of the turn of the century, leading to talk of \r\nthe “millennium of hope”, seems to be dissipating. It is \r\nestimated that the increase in food prices alone has \r\ndriven more than 100 million people into extreme \r\npoverty. In turn, financial instability today is afflicting \r\nmany economies, threatening to generate a worldwide \r\ntrend towards recession in which — as always — those \r\nmost affected in the end will be the world’s poorest. \r\n That is why it is so crucial to review our Goals. \r\nWe cannot remain indifferent to the deterioration of the \r\nbasic well-being of millions and millions of citizens all \r\nover the world. Those of us who share the same \r\nconcept of progress and have made freedom and social \r\njustice our watchwords must raise our voices. \r\n The world has managed to secure the economic, \r\ntechnical and scientific resources that, for the first time \r\nin its history, can ensure the well-being of all mankind. \r\nWe cannot squander that capacity. A better world is \r\npossible, but it requires determination to move \r\nforward, and the current international economic crisis \r\nshows that it is precisely such determination that has \r\nbeen lacking. \r\n The greed and irresponsibility of a few, combined \r\nwith the political negligence of others, has plunged the \r\nworld into a situation of great uncertainty. What a \r\nparadox we are witnessing today! With the money used \r\nto bail out the international banking system, the \r\nscourge of hunger on the planet could easily have been \r\neliminated. Thus, now is the time to reaffirm our \r\nresolve. \r\n The international economic crisis is a blow to \r\nthose who believe that nothing can be done, that \r\nnothing should be regulated or that inequality cannot \r\nbe remedied. That is the major lesson to be learned \r\nfrom what has happened over the past year. None of \r\nthe current problems facing mankind, and certainly \r\nnone of the civilizing goals that we have set ourselves, \r\ncan be tackled properly if the public does not have a \r\nclear option of collective action by States and civil \r\nsociety. \r\n That is why today I appeal to all to work together \r\nto support emergency measures to address the food \r\ncrisis and to redouble our efforts to ensure that the \r\ndeveloping economic crisis does not prevent us from \r\nattaining the Millennium Development Goals. That is \r\nwhy I appeal for an urgent and genuine commitment to \r\nmultilateralism. That is why we must undertake to \r\ncontinue supporting and reforming international \r\ninstitutions, particularly the United Nations, to make \r\nthem more representative, more democratic and more \r\nresponsive to the hopes of our peoples. \r\n That is also why we must reach agreement at the \r\nDoha Round of the World Trade Organization. That is \r\nwhy we must achieve concrete results at the \r\nforthcoming Follow-up International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development. That is why we must also \r\nensure the success of the 2009 Copenhagen Climate \r\nChange Conference and convert those negotiations into \r\nagreements that make a decisive contribution to \r\ndevelopment. \r\n I appear before this General Assembly as the \r\nrepresentative of a nation that has much to contribute. \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 16 \r\n \r\nModestly and proudly, we announce to this Assembly \r\nthat Chile is ahead of schedule towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals set for 2015. I \r\nemphasize that it is possible to eradicate poverty, that it \r\nis possible to emerge from underdevelopment and, \r\neven more importantly, that it is possible to do so in \r\ndemocracy and freedom. \r\n My country almost tripled the size of its economy \r\nbetween 1990 and 2008, which are the years of \r\ndemocracy in Chile. Just as we have made the economy \r\ngrow, we have also made social investment and equity \r\ngrow. We have advanced strongly on all fronts: health, \r\neducation, housing, quality of life, social cohesion and \r\ngreater gender opportunities. \r\n The numbers speak for themselves. At the end of \r\nthe dictatorship, in 1989, 4 out of every 10 Chileans \r\nwere living in poverty. That 40 per cent dropped to \r\n13 per cent in 2006. Although there is much to do, \r\nwhenever we achieve one goal we set ourselves a new \r\nhorizon of challenges. Just as we have drastically \r\nreduced poverty, today we aim to guarantee universal \r\naccess for all Chileans to a social welfare system that \r\nallows them to live their lives in tranquillity and \r\nremoves the fear of disease, poverty or old age, thus \r\nincreasing opportunities for all, so as to advance \r\nsteadily in greater equality and dignity. \r\n However, this morning I wish to highlight the \r\nreasons for those achievements. What underlies them is \r\na clear political determination, shared by the majority. \r\nThe country has freely chosen a path of economic \r\ngrowth, political democracy and social justice. All \r\npolitical sectors have converged on that path, with \r\ndifferences, of course, as in any democracy, but all are \r\naware that those are the major goals of Chilean society, \r\nbecause behind the achievements there is also a sad \r\nlearning process. \r\n In the past, when the country became divided, \r\nwhen the country became polarized in two \r\nirreconcilable factions, there was much suffering and \r\nvery great social setbacks. Democracy placed at the \r\ncentre of public life, as a goal for a freer and more just \r\nsociety, has been one of the main lessons that we \r\nChileans have learned and that largely explains the \r\nachievements of the last 18 years.  \r\n That same conviction led us recently to be very \r\nactive in coming to the aid of a friendly democracy. \r\nOne week ago, when there was a threat to disrupt the \r\ndemocratic institutional order in the Republic of \r\nBolivia, we nations of South America came to the \r\nsupport of the legitimately elected authorities and \r\noffered our cooperation to help in the resumption of the \r\ndomestic political dialogue, while condemning the \r\nrebellion and bloodshed. Within a few days, we \r\nsucceeded in convening a meeting of the Presidents of \r\nthe member countries of the Union of South American \r\nNations in Santiago de Chile, in order to agree with the \r\nPresident of Bolivia on a process for talks and to find \r\nand support a peaceful solution to the conflict in that \r\ncountry.  \r\n From this rostrum, as the convener of that \r\nhistoric regional meeting, I wish to express \r\nappreciation for the willingness displayed by all those \r\ninvolved, because we thereby set an example of how \r\nmultilateral commitment should be understood. It is a \r\ncommitment forged in the diversity of political projects \r\nbut based on shared values, such as democracy, peace \r\nand the defence of human rights. The La Moneda \r\nsummit — as that meeting was called, after the Chilean \r\npresidential palace — will forever symbolize the \r\nmoment at which the South American nations decided \r\nto strengthen their commitment to democracy, \r\nwhenever it is threatened anywhere on the continent. \r\n Yet what does that episode tell us? It tells us that \r\nthe values of democracy, dialogue, human rights and \r\npeace are becoming stronger than ever in Latin \r\nAmerica. It tells us that the region wants to leave \r\nbehind the dark moments of its history. It tells us that \r\ndemocracy is established as a system of government. It \r\ntells us that violence has no place in politics. And it \r\ntells us that those values, in addition to being widely \r\nshared by the citizens, are becoming entrenched in \r\nmultilateralism, in institutions and in international law. \r\n Over these years, we have learned that national \r\npolicies, although essential, are not enough, that there \r\nis no incompatibility between affirmation of one’s own \r\nidentity and integration, and that international \r\nagreements must be formulated to govern globalization \r\nand make democracy and the social rights of the \r\ncitizens a universal requirement. Each country has the \r\nright and the duty to contribute to the creation of a \r\nworld in which the great values of mankind prevail, \r\nregardless of the country’s economic or demographic \r\ndimension, of its influence or its power, or of how \r\nclose it is to or how far it is from the hubs where \r\ndecisions that affect the lives of each and every one of \r\nthe planet’s inhabitants are taken. \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n17 08-51749 \r\n \r\n From our position at the south of the world, Chile \r\nis cooperating. We have enthusiastically supported, and \r\nin some cases promoted, the most diverse initiatives in \r\npursuit of the development of our peoples. A few days \r\nago, in Santiago de Chile, together with the Prime \r\nMinister of Norway, we launched an important regional \r\ninitiative for the attainment of Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals 4 and 5 in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. Under that initiative, Chile will cooperate \r\nin the assignment and training of troops in Bolivia, \r\nEcuador and other countries of the region. However, \r\nwhen we say “troops”, we are not talking about \r\nsoldiers. It will be a force of nurses, midwives and \r\ndoctors specialized in maternal and child health, who \r\nwill travel through the fields and mountain ranges of \r\nour America, delivering babies, helping mothers, \r\nproviding vaccinations and caring for sick children. \r\nBecause despite the progress made in that regard in \r\nrecent years, which has increased the percentage of \r\nattended births from 78 to 89 per cent, still 22,000 \r\nmothers die in Latin America each year simply because \r\nthey received no professional care. Despite the \r\nimprovement in child mortality, 400,000 Latin \r\nAmerican children under five years of age are still \r\ndying each year — hence, the urgency of that initiative, \r\nwhich is the urgency of promoting democracy and the \r\nsocial development of our people. \r\n In just over two months, the world will have a \r\nnoble reason for celebration. It will be the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. What a great step \r\nforward for mankind. That transcendental charter of \r\nrights marked the beginning of the end of centuries and \r\ncenturies of arbitrary action, death, torture and abuse \r\nof power. Certainly that charter did not represent an \r\nimmediate solution, but it did mean the beginning of \r\nthe largest and most effective social and political \r\nmobilization in favour of people’s dignity. \r\n Today, those who violate that charter sully their \r\nreputation with the international community. We have \r\ngone even further by creating an international \r\narchitecture of protection and legal advancement, in \r\nwhich my region set a great precedent with the inter-\r\nAmerican human rights protection system. \r\n We hope that something similar will happen with \r\nthe Millennium Declaration. We want it to become an \r\nethical and political requirement for all the world’s \r\nrulers. We want the citizens of every country to protest \r\nagainst famine, poverty and unsanitary conditions. We \r\nwant discrimination against women to be reason for \r\nshame for all those who practise it. We want \r\ndiscrimination against native peoples to be eliminated \r\nfrom the face of the Earth. We want protection of the \r\nenvironment to be part of the vocabulary of every \r\ninhabitant of the planet and, definitely, of the priorities \r\nof every Government in the world. We want \r\ncooperation by those who have the most to be a \r\npolitical as well as a moral obligation. That is Chile’s \r\nachievable desire, which we have come to present to \r\nthis General Assembly. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Chile for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\nMrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Danilo Türk, President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia. \r\nMr. Danilo Türk, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Danilo Türk, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Slovenia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Türk: We are starting this sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly under the wise and \r\ninspiring leadership of our President, \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann. We rely on your \r\nexperience and your political acumen, Sir, and I wish \r\nyou every success in your work. At the same time, I \r\nwish to express our sincere gratitude to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session, who \r\nguided the Assembly with great sensitivity and \r\ndetermination. I also wish to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose tireless \r\nefforts are guiding the United Nations at this turbulent \r\ntime.  \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 18 \r\n \r\n Indeed, we live in a turbulent world at a turbulent \r\ntime. We need real answers to the accumulated global \r\nproblems. The era of optimism generated by \r\nglobalization has come to an end. The eruption of the \r\nfinancial crisis in recent weeks has removed the last \r\nshred of doubt about that. The world needs real \r\nanswers to big questions. \r\n If you asked me to identify the key policy \r\nrequirement for the United Nations today with a single \r\nconcept — and in one word — my answer would be \r\nthis: we live at a time requiring transformation. \r\nTransformation should be the key idea of policymaking \r\nto guide United Nations action. The United Nations \r\nshould look to policies with a transformational \r\npotential and capable of producing transformational \r\neffects in the not-too-distant future. Obviously, that \r\nambitious and general proposition begs further \r\nquestions. Is the United Nations capable of generating \r\nsocial, political and economic transformation? Does \r\nthe United Nations of today know what is the main \r\narea for the necessary strategic transformation? What \r\nneeds to be done, by way of transformation, in the \r\nmost sensitive area of the United Nations mandate, in \r\nthe area of the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity? Allow me to address those questions one by \r\none. \r\n First, is the United Nations capable of generating \r\nsocial and political transformation worldwide? The \r\nUnited Nations has demonstrated such an ability in \r\nvarious areas of its work in the past. United Nations \r\naction in the field of human rights offers an excellent \r\nexample. Later this year we will celebrate the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, and it does not take much effort to realize how \r\nmuch the change that has occurred in those 60 years \r\nowes to the transformational energy of human rights.  \r\n Consider this: at the time of the adoption of the \r\nUniversal Declaration in 1948, the world had \r\nexperienced one of its most traumatic moments. The \r\nSecond World War was barely over, its aftershocks \r\nwere still strongly felt, and much of the world was \r\nphysically destroyed. Stalinist oppression was the \r\ndominant feature of the Soviet Union and of a large \r\npart of Europe. In Asia and Africa, large populations \r\nsuffered under the yoke of colonialism. The system of \r\napartheid was being introduced in South Africa. Yet, \r\nthat was the time when the authors of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights outlined an optimistic \r\nvision of a just society and a better world. Human \r\nrights were the genuinely transformational idea of the \r\ntime and that idea has guided social change and \r\ndevelopment ever since. \r\n The world of today, while still far from ideal, is \r\nsubstantially better than the world of 1948. Human \r\nrights have triumphed in many parts of the world and \r\nare making steady progress in others. Many of the \r\noppressive systems have ended in the dustbin of \r\nhistory. The remaining ones are likely to follow. \r\nDemocracy has progressed globally and is today the \r\nway of life of more people than ever before. \r\n Obviously, violations of human rights still persist, \r\nas reported by the United Nations experts and by non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. Some of the causes of \r\nviolations, such as racial discrimination, are persistent \r\nand take place in new forms. New issues of human \r\nrights have also arisen. Concerns related to security \r\nand counter-terrorism seem to have contributed to a \r\ndiminished care for human rights in some societies. \r\nThe abhorrent practice of torture has gained a degree of \r\nacceptance, which should be a cause for serious \r\nconcern for all those who take human rights seriously. \r\nArmed conflicts continue to produce atrocities and \r\nmassive violations of human rights.  \r\n Those phenomena must be met with resolute \r\ncounteraction. Human rights institutions need to be \r\nstrengthened and supported. Human rights education \r\ndeserves higher priority. The principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect must be given real meaning \r\nand real teeth through diplomatic and other action. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court has to be accepted and \r\nmade effective as the key institution for punishing \r\nperpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity \r\nand genocide. Violations of human rights have to be \r\ncombated wherever they occur. \r\n But in addition, there is an even more \r\nfundamental reality that affects the actual enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights by all. The Universal Declaration \r\nproclaimed, in its article 28, that everyone is entitled to \r\na social and international order in which their human \r\nrights can be fully realized. The authors of the \r\nDeclaration realistically envisaged the long-term nature \r\nof the effort for human rights. Guided by that spirit, the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted, in 1986, its Declaration on \r\nthe Right to Development, a right which became \r\nrecognized as universal at the World Conference on \r\nHuman Rights held in Vienna in 1993. That was a \r\nsignificant and realistic recognition of the intrinsic link \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n19 08-51749 \r\n \r\nbetween two fundamental human aspirations: the one \r\nfor human freedom and the other for human \r\ndevelopment. In subsequent years, the United Nations \r\nalso developed a comprehensive understanding of what \r\ndevelopment is and what it means in our era. That \r\nunderstanding was elaborated at a series of global \r\nconferences in the 1990s and summarized in the year \r\n2000 in the form of the agreement on global \r\ndevelopment goals. \r\n The vision exists and practical progress, while \r\nstill uneven, is visible. The high-level meeting on \r\nAfrica last Monday strengthened the existing global \r\nconsensus about the immediate priorities for Africa, \r\nincluding more effective financing for development. \r\nThe panel discussions on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals tomorrow will be an opportunity to discuss the \r\nkey issues of today, in particular those emerging from \r\nthe current food crisis. I also hope that the proposal of \r\nthe Secretary-General for a summit to consider \r\nprogress in the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in 2010 will gain wide support. \r\n Those and other discussions also help in \r\nanswering my second question: does the United \r\nNations know the strategic direction in which the \r\ntransformational effort must be concentrated today? \r\nYes, the Millennium Development Goals are part of the \r\nanswer, but it is already clear that global \r\ndevelopment — now and in the foreseeable future — \r\nwill vitally depend on the preservation of our natural \r\nenvironment and, in particular, on how we address the \r\nproblems of energy and global warming. The battle for \r\nour common, global future will be won — or lost — on \r\nthe environmental front, and that is where the main \r\ntransformational effort has to take place. There is no \r\ntime to lose. \r\n Earlier this year, the European Union, under the \r\npresidency of my country, Slovenia, adopted a plan of \r\nactivities to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. \r\nYesterday, President Sarkozy of France, the current \r\nPresident of the European Council, reiterated the \r\nEuropean Union commitment to the success of the Bali \r\nroad map and the Copenhagen conference to be held \r\nnext year. In the meantime — and I wish to emphasize \r\nthis — progress must be made at the conference in \r\nPoznan, Poland, and in the process leading to the \r\nCopenhagen conference and to the final global \r\nagreement. \r\n But those efforts will succeed only if an adequate \r\npartnership is established among the key economic and \r\npolitical players. Partnership between the European \r\nUnion, the United States, Japan, China, India and the \r\nGroup of 77 countries is essential. The existing \r\nenvironmental challenges call for a transformational \r\napproach to the way the world consumes energy, the \r\nway it develops technology and the way it pursues \r\ndevelopment. Incremental change will not do. Global \r\ncooperation is essential. Obviously — and I would \r\nunderline this — the responsibilities of the developed \r\nand the developing countries are not the same. They \r\nare differentiated. But the world as a whole has to \r\nmove ahead and the United Nations has to get the \r\ndirection right. Transformation is the order of the day. \r\n My third question relates to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and the necessary \r\ntransformation in that area. Allow me to state right at \r\nthe outset that there is a serious need for \r\ntransformation of the existing institutions in the field \r\nof international security. \r\n The international security landscape today offers \r\na mixed picture. After the end of the cold war, there \r\nwere moments of high hopes and moments of deep \r\ndisappointment. There were successes and failures, \r\nincluding the failure to prevent genocide. But we also \r\nhave to point out that the overall number of armed \r\nconflicts has been declining for more than a decade \r\nnow. That is an encouraging development indeed, and \r\nit is in no small measure due to the contribution of the \r\nUnited Nations, which has steadily increased its \r\nexperience and its capacity in peacekeeping, post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding and, to some extent, preventive \r\ndiplomacy. The role of the Secretary-General has been \r\nstrengthened in all those areas. \r\n The progress made so far has established a degree \r\nof confidence in the capacity of the international \r\nsecurity structures and their key players to cooperate \r\nand, even more, to work in partnership for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\nHowever, it appears that the confidence developed thus \r\nfar is still fragile and that remnants of the cold war \r\nmentality are still in existence. Further efforts are \r\ntherefore needed. Those efforts, in my opinion, involve \r\ntwo basic sets of tasks.  \r\n The first set of tasks relates to the development of \r\npartnerships to address the key security issues, in \r\nparticular those in the Middle East, the Caucasus, the \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 20 \r\n \r\nBalkans and several regions of Africa. In all those \r\nareas, there has been a degree of success in \r\nestablishing cooperation and partnership among the \r\nkey regional and global players working for peace. \r\nModels of concerted diplomacy such as the one \r\nestablished to deal with the issues of North Korea can \r\nand should inspire preventive diplomacy and \r\npeacemaking in other parts of the world. \r\n The second set of tasks is equally urgent. \r\nImmediate consideration has to be given to a \r\ntransformation of the existing security structures. \r\nReform of the Security Council is long overdue. \r\nIncremental improvements of its working methods, \r\nwhile welcome, are far from sufficient. The time is ripe \r\nfor changes in the Council’s structure. I believe that the \r\nmembership of the Security Council should be \r\nexpanded, and that that should be done in three \r\ndirections. First, there should be six additional \r\npermanent members from every region of the world. \r\nSecondly, there should be an additional category of \r\nnon-permanent members with a more frequent rotation, \r\nsix in any particular composition of the Security \r\nCouncil, and they should be elected in accordance with \r\na formula to be determined by the General Assembly \r\nand alternate every second two-year term. Thirdly, the \r\nremaining eight non-permanent members would be \r\nelected in accordance with the principle of equitable \r\ngeographic distribution. This three-point idea means \r\nthat the total size of the reformed Security Council \r\nwould not exceed 25 members; it would be a 25-\r\nmember Council. It would be a more representative \r\nCouncil and, I believe, a more effective one.  \r\n I offer those ideas on reform of the Security \r\nCouncil to you, Mr. President, to use in the coming \r\nefforts for Council reform. It is widely accepted that \r\nthat work needs to progress towards a successful \r\nconclusion. Success in Council reform would represent \r\na key contribution to the transformation of the \r\ninternational security architecture. Together with other \r\nmajor projects of the United Nations, it would \r\nconstitute a significant contribution to the \r\nimprovement of the world. \r\n Allow me to conclude. Is all of this new? In a \r\ncertain sense, yes, because some of the specific tasks \r\nand specific projects are new. But more deeply, the \r\nanswer is that all of this has to do with continuity. The \r\nUnited Nations has, from its inception, represented the \r\nhope for and the promise of an improved world. Let us \r\nnot betray that hope and let us live up to that promise. \r\nLet us work for transformation wherever necessary. Let \r\nus make this era the finest hour of the United Nations. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Slovenia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Danilo Türk, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nDominican Republic. \r\nMr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Leonel \r\nFernández Reyna, President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Fernández Reyna (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of the \r\nDominican Republic, I am pleased to extend our \r\nwarmest congratulations to the President of the General \r\nAssembly, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of the \r\nsister Republic of Nicaragua, on his recent election. We \r\nalso take this opportunity to greet our fellow Member \r\nStates in this General Assembly.  \r\n Eight years ago, in this same place, \r\nrepresentatives of 189 countries undertook a crucial \r\ncommitment, possibly one of the most transcendental \r\ncommitments that such a large number of nations ever \r\nmade. They agreed on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). In the year 2000, it was believed — \r\nand this is still the case today — that the objectives \r\nestablished at that time would go down in the common \r\nhistory of humankind as the bravest ethical decision \r\never taken in the face of extreme poverty, the shame of \r\ngeneralized injustice and the heartbreaking tragedy of \r\nsocial inequity. It was an agenda of work and \r\ndedication that required a large dose of political will, \r\nactions laid out in conformity with the goals to be \r\nreached, a reorganization of budgetary priorities and a \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n21 08-51749 \r\n \r\ngreater flow of aid resources and support for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n We did not undertake the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in vague terms. We did not couch \r\nthe Millennium Declaration in abstract and \r\ngrandiloquent concepts lacking in substance. Quite the \r\ncontrary, we analysed with the greatest possible rigour \r\nthe situation that we wanted to correct. We measured \r\nwith mathematical precision its overwhelming scope \r\nand the magnitude of the political and financial effort \r\nthat its reversal would require.  \r\n We committed to the MDGs with such supreme \r\nresponsibility that we even set a date for their \r\nachievement: the year 2015. Now we are halfway to \r\nthat date, and we face the disheartening situation of an \r\ninternational landscape full of obstacles to overcome if \r\nwe are to conclude what we set out to do in the year \r\n2000. We knew there would be difficulties. We \r\nrecognized that we would have to overcome immense \r\nobstacles, and we had identified every type of major \r\nchallenge that would await us in the quest to carry out \r\nour plans.  \r\n In the Dominican Republic, we have been able to \r\nachieve some progress towards the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Since 1991, we have \r\nreduced by more than half the percentage of five-year-\r\nold children who are underweight for their age. We \r\nhave also made progress in achieving our goals related \r\nto health development and have the spread of \r\nHIV/AIDS under control.  \r\n However, we now know that over and above the \r\nlimited progress achieved, not just by the Dominican \r\nRepublic but by developing countries on all continents, \r\nmore than half a million women still die every year \r\nfrom complications of pregnancy and childbirth that \r\ncould be treated and prevented. We now know that, \r\nunless an extraordinary effort is made from now on, \r\ninstead of reaching the goal of reducing by half the \r\nproportion of children of low birth weight, their \r\nnumber will grow to over 30 million. We also know \r\nthat in 2006, the number of deaths caused by AIDS \r\nrose to almost 3 million and that the preventive \r\nmeasures against that ominous pandemic remain \r\ngrossly insufficient. Also disheartening is the fact that \r\nmore than 600 million people will not have better \r\nhealth services than the ones they currently have access \r\nto.  \r\n Now, at the same time that this is occurring, the \r\nrichest nations, which committed to providing \r\nextraordinary official development assistance in order \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals, have in \r\ngeneral fallen short in carrying out their pledges. Only \r\nfive of those nations — Norway, Sweden, the \r\nNetherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg — have \r\nhonoured their commitments, making contributions \r\nequal to and in some cases greater than the 0.7 per cent \r\nof their gross national income established as \r\nappropriate by this world Organization.  \r\n Nonetheless, we can be sure that, in order to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, we will \r\nnow require a financial rescue plan from the \r\ninternational community — in a sort of bailout, as it is \r\nreferred to nowadays. According to studies by the \r\nWorld Bank, a yearly average of approximately \r\n$50 billion in foreign aid would be needed to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. That is to say that \r\nachieving the goals of improving the quality of life and \r\ndignity in the living conditions of the poorest nations \r\nof the world would require an international economic \r\nfinancing plan as bold and as urgent as that currently \r\nbeing undertaken to save Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, \r\nBear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, AIG and other financial \r\ninstitutions. In other words, over the next seven years, \r\nuntil 2015, the date established for the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, according to the \r\ncriteria of the World Bank, we would need $350 billion \r\nof foreign aid. That represents half of the amount that \r\nis being debated at this very moment in the United \r\nStates Congress to save from bankruptcy the financial \r\nbusinesses of Wall Street responsible for their own \r\nfailures.  \r\n The people of the world affected by hunger and \r\nmisery are crying out to the international community to \r\nlend the same urgent attention to the resolution of their \r\nplight that has been given to efforts to rescue banking \r\ninstitutions on the brink of collapse. We cannot \r\nentertain the idea that rescuing the dignity of the \r\nworld’s poor is less important or urgent as rescuing the \r\ninstitutions operating in the world’s most important \r\nfinancial centre.  \r\n We would like it to be clear that we have not \r\ncome here to condemn anyone. We have not come to \r\npoint a finger at any friendly nation that is a Member \r\nof the United Nations family. Rather, we wish to sound \r\nthe alarm and be a voice that troubles the conscience \r\nand calls for a solution to a problem that affects all \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 22 \r\n \r\npoor nations and is socially unjust and ethically \r\nunacceptable.  \r\n We would like to use this forum, however, to \r\nhighlight other factors that hinder the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the progress of \r\nour nations. Such is the case, for example, of the \r\nunregulated speculation in the buying and selling of \r\nfutures contracts for oil and food. There is no way to \r\nhide the fact that, without regulation, the futures \r\nmarkets are mechanisms that lend themselves through \r\nexcessive speculation, fraud and manipulation to a \r\ndistortion of the fundamental principles of economic \r\nactivity. We do not question the fact that, with respect \r\nto the determination of oil prices, supply has not \r\nincreased significantly while demand has increased; \r\nthat there has been insufficient investment in new \r\nrefineries in recent years; that there are geopolitical \r\ntensions in various parts of the world, or that the \r\nUnited States dollar has decreased in value. All of that \r\nis true.  \r\n What we do question, however, is the fact, that in \r\njust 12 months, the price of a barrel of oil rose from \r\n$70 to almost $150. In July, we were stupefied to see \r\nthe price of a barrel of oil rise $10 in a single day. Just \r\ntwo days ago, while we were here in New York, we \r\nsaw with great perplexity an increase of not just \r\n$10 but $25 per barrel in a single day. How can we \r\nexplain that? Is it that suddenly, in just one day, the \r\nwhole world increased its demand so abruptly, or did \r\nthe world’s oil wells unexpectedly disappear? \r\n In reality, there is but one explanation: excessive \r\nspeculation in the futures markets. It is \r\nincomprehensible that some can sell something they do \r\nnot have while others can buy what they do not expect \r\nto receive. However, that is what has been happening \r\nrecently, in the clearest example of so-called casino \r\ncapitalism. \r\n In just five years, hundreds of billions of dollars \r\nhave entered the commodities futures markets, largely \r\ndirected towards energy, while prices shot up by more \r\nthan 200 per cent between July 2003 and July 2008. \r\nThat has occurred not just with a few commodities, but \r\nwith every single one of the 25 products on the world \r\nmarket index for commodities. In the past five years, \r\nthe price of wheat has gone up by 177 per cent, soy by \r\n196 per cent and corn by 214 per cent.  \r\n Nevertheless, we must reiterate here that what \r\nhas the greatest impact on the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals is skyrocketing oil \r\nprices. In the Dominican Republic, our oil bill has \r\nrisen from $1.667 billion in 2004 to a projected \r\n$6.5 billion this year. That represents a difference of \r\nalmost 500 per cent. With that difference of $5 billion, \r\nthe Dominican Republic could have financed every \r\npublic investment laid out in the cost analyses of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals from 2008 to 2015. \r\n The world does not aspire to be a gambling den. \r\nThe world does not want continuous manipulation or \r\npermanent fraud in regard to factors that have a \r\ndecisive effect on the quality of life. The world, in fact, \r\nhas very simple aspirations: to live in conditions of \r\nsocial justice and equity, with the creation of \r\nopportunities so that every human being can develop \r\nhis or her creative potential, both material and \r\nspiritual. \r\n For the achievement of such noble objectives, the \r\nStates that have committed themselves to realizing the \r\nMDGs as an agenda of true and genuine social \r\ntransformation turn to the United Nations system with \r\noptimism and hope that it can correct and make up for \r\nexisting distortions. \r\n We trust that with so many intelligent persons \r\nmeeting here, working towards a better life for all of \r\nhumankind, important solutions will be brought to the \r\ntable with the same speed, urgency and interest that are \r\nbeing shown in drawing up rescue plans for bankrupt \r\nbanks during these turbulent times in the world of \r\nfinance. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Dominican Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade.  \r\n Mr. Leonel Fernández Reina, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, President \r\nof the United Mexican States \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the United \r\nMexican States. \r\n Mr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, President of the \r\nUnited Mexican States, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n23 08-51749 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Felipe Calderón \r\nHinojosa, President of the United Mexican States, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Calderón Hinojosa (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Allow me first of all to congratulate you, \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, on your election to \r\nthe presidency of this Assembly. It is truly an honour \r\nfor Latin America to have you leading our work. \r\n I have come to the United Nations to reaffirm \r\nMexico’s permanent commitment to strengthen our \r\nmultilateral system and to build a world order that is \r\nmore human, more just, more prosperous, cleaner and \r\nmore secure. \r\n The problems and challenges that are faced today \r\nby humankind demand a renewed and strengthened \r\nUnited Nations. Mexico is convinced that the United \r\nNations is at a definitive historical moment. Global \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century are testing the \r\nleadership and the vitality of the Organization. \r\n Threats to global security are not only the result \r\nof conflicts between States, but of the challenges posed \r\nby the activities of non-State actors such as \r\ninternational organized crime groups dealing in \r\nterrorism and drug trafficking. Those threats also \r\ninclude the degradation of the environment, pandemics, \r\nextreme poverty and massive violations of human \r\nrights. \r\n I would like to start with a first challenge for our \r\ngeneration and our civilization. Few challenges are as \r\nurgent as reversing the effects of climate change. This \r\nphenomenon affects indiscriminately rich countries as \r\nwell as poor, and paradoxically those that have \r\ncontributed the least to it are often those that are the \r\nmost vulnerable. \r\n Climate change is not a problem to be faced by \r\nnations according to their degree of development. It is \r\na task that requires moving from words to action \r\nsubstantiated in concrete proposals that are based on \r\nthe principles of common, but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n Mexico has accordingly proposed the \r\nestablishment, within the United Nations of a Green \r\nFund that will provide incentives for States to redouble \r\ntheir efforts in this area. It is a great satisfaction for us \r\nto see that organizations like the World Bank have \r\nalready taken the initiative to broaden the availability \r\nof resources for the benefit of the countries that need \r\nthem. \r\n And so today, before this Assembly, I reaffirm on \r\nbehalf of my country the proposal of Mexico to set up \r\nsuch a Green Fund to which each State can all \r\ncontribute according to its economic capacity and that \r\nall of us could use in order to finance programmes to \r\ncut emissions, increase energy efficiency or establish \r\nmeasures for adapting to climate change. \r\n I respectfully call upon all nations, especially the \r\nmost developed, to contribute to the establishment of \r\nthis Green Fund for the creation of financial \r\ninstruments to protect the world’s environment. \r\n As the Mexican Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz \r\nsaid:  \r\n“Whatever the form of political and social \r\norganization adopted by nations, the most \r\nimmediate and pressing issue is the survival of \r\nthe natural environment. To defend nature is to \r\ndefend humankind.” \r\n We have no time or margin of error to avoid our \r\nresponsibility with regard to another global challenge \r\nthat particularly affects the poor: the international rise \r\nof food prices. We must act decisively to prevent that \r\nsituation from annulling the efforts we have made to \r\novercome poverty. \r\n In order to guarantee food security, the \r\nGovernment of Mexico has developed an action plan \r\nthat aims to facilitate access to the supply of food and \r\nincludes a sharp reduction of taxes on commodity \r\nimports, the enhancement of production, irrigation \r\ninfrastructure and productivity in the countryside, the \r\nestablishment of a national strategic reserve of \r\ncommodities and an increase in direct and conditional \r\nfinancial grants to the 6 million poorest families in the \r\ncountry as compensation for the rise in food prices. \r\n Indeed, many countries not only will be unable to \r\nmeet the targets set at the 2000 World Summit, but \r\nhave already experienced setbacks in the fight against \r\npoverty because of the phenomenon of high food \r\nprices. Despite that unfavourable environment, Mexico \r\nis achieving practically all of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. In fact, we have set additional \r\nobjectives that are reflected in our national \r\ndevelopment plan. To meet that challenge, Mexico has \r\npromoted a significant increase in its social spending, \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 24 \r\n \r\nincluding in education, health and human development. \r\nNext year, we shall allocate $125 billion, or 60 per cent \r\nof our budget, to social spending.  \r\n Let me cite some examples. A conditional direct \r\ntransfer programme known as Opportunities, which \r\nenables families belonging to the most vulnerable \r\ngroups of the population to send their children to \r\nschool or to make regular visits to the doctor, has made \r\nit possible to reduce the country’s rate of extreme \r\npoverty. Over the past 10 years, the number of persons \r\nliving in extreme poverty has fallen from 38 million to \r\nfewer than 15 million. We have also achieved universal \r\ncoverage in basic education. In addition, we have set a \r\nvery clear goal of achieving, by 2011, every country’s \r\nideal in the area of health: universal coverage, \r\nincluding medical care, medicine and treatment, for all \r\nMexican women and men.  \r\n We are living in an era of shared responsibility. \r\nEveryone knows that, in a globalized world, the \r\nconsequences of our actions transcend the territories of \r\nour countries and affect the entire planet. The security \r\nthreats faced by Mexico and Latin America are a good \r\nexample of shared challenges; the illicit trade in drugs, \r\nweapons and human persons knows no borders. Today, \r\nLatin America is one of the regions with the highest \r\nnumbers of violent deaths in the world, and that has \r\nbecome one of the major limitations to our \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In Mexico, we are decisively addressing the \r\ndelinquency and organized crime that threaten our \r\nsociety and our democratic institutions. Mexican \r\nfamilies have decided to live in a Mexico of peace and \r\nlaws — a Mexico in which neither impunity nor crime \r\nis tolerated. That is why we have begun to tackle crime \r\nhead on. However, that requires shared international \r\nresponsibility. Mexico reiterates its appeal to all \r\nnations to seek new forms of cooperation against those \r\nthreats. The eradication of those scourges is a guiding \r\nprinciple of Mexico’s national security policy and of \r\nthe international agenda that we are promoting. \r\n In addition to those problems, there is an \r\nincreasing questioning of the principles and values \r\ndefended by the United Nations — principles and \r\nvalues that were once believed to have taken root in the \r\ncommunity of States. Some have called into question \r\nthe fundamental principles of democracy and human \r\nrights, citing security requirements or the pre-eminence \r\nof economic and social rights. In commemorating the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, Mexico calls on Member \r\nStates to defend the universal values that are a \r\nprecondition for human development and the rule of \r\nlaw. \r\n Migratory flows are another global phenomenon \r\nof our time. In today’s world, more than 200 million \r\npeople live outside their countries of origin. The causes \r\nof international migration are complex, ranging from \r\nthe consolidation of integration processes to the \r\ndemand for labour, the lack of adequate economic \r\nconditions and the persistence of internal or inter-State \r\nconflicts. Included in that population are millions of \r\nMexicans living here in the United States, who have \r\nsought opportunities for a dignified life for their \r\nfamilies. \r\n Migration cannot be reduced to the issue of \r\nsecurity, nor can it be managed as merely an economic \r\nphenomenon. That is why Mexico believes that the \r\ninternational community must view it in a \r\ncomprehensive manner that permits migratory flows to \r\nbe legal, safe, orderly and respectful of human dignity. \r\nThe United Nations must fully shoulder its \r\nresponsibility in the light of that global phenomenon, \r\nguided by the principle of shared responsibility among \r\nthe countries of origin, transit and destination. \r\n Terrorism, regardless of its justifications or \r\nideological motivations, has no place in the community \r\nof values that we have forged with such great \r\ndifficulty. Mexico condemns it and reaffirms its \r\nreadiness to cooperate on the basis of international law \r\nto prevent terrorist acts and punish their perpetrators.  \r\n The paradox is that all those problems can be \r\ndealt with and resolved only through global action, \r\nwhich requires the mediation of the United Nations. \r\n We Mexicans do not wish to shirk our global \r\nresponsibilities, nor will we do so. We want to be \r\nactors in — not observers of — the world’s \r\ntransformations. We have decided to strengthen our \r\nactivism. Mexico has the eleventh largest population \r\nand the twelfth largest economy in the world, and we \r\nhave a long tradition of contributing to peace and \r\ninternational law. \r\n Therefore, we want to occupy a place of \r\nresponsibility and commitment to the common good of \r\nnations. That is why Mexico has submitted its \r\ncandidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n25 08-51749 \r\n \r\nCouncil for the period 2009-2010. If elected, my \r\ncountry will commit itself to acting on the basis of the \r\nfundamental values of the international community: the \r\nprevention and peaceful settlement of disputes; \r\nprohibition of the use or threat of use of force; and \r\ncompliance with the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, international law and human rights. \r\n We aspire to participate in the Security Council in \r\norder to promote Mexico’s democratic ideals, which \r\nuphold the rule of law. We would strive to support the \r\nCouncil’s efforts to rebuild societies and institutions \r\ntorn apart by war and by emerging threats. We would \r\nwork to ensure the settlement of disputes between \r\nStates at the earliest possible stage before the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as well as compliance \r\nwith its decisions.  \r\n Our generation has a historic responsibility to act, \r\nhere and now, to meet the challenges of humankind in \r\nthe twenty-first century. It is our conviction that the \r\nUnited Nations is the forum that best represents the \r\ndiversity of human beings, the plurality of nations and \r\nour civilization’s collective aspirations to well-being \r\nand progress. It is a privileged alliance formed to \r\nensure a world of peace and justice, security and \r\ndevelopment, with well-being and opportunities for all.  \r\n Multilateralism is the path of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. It is a comprehensive response to globalization. \r\nIn the new global era, we also need a strengthened and \r\nrenewed global Organization. We must join forces in \r\norder to make it possible for the United Nations to turn \r\ninto reality the dream of its founders: peace, security \r\nand development for all the peoples of the planet. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe United Mexican States for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, President of the \r\nUnited Mexican States, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal. \r\n Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Abdoulaye \r\nWade, President of the Republic of Senegal, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Wade (spoke in French): Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto, in electing you to the presidency of the \r\nAssembly, Member States wished to show their \r\nconfidence in your wealth of experience, as former \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, to successfully guide its \r\nwork. The Senegalese delegation congratulates you \r\nthrough me. At the same time I wish to thank and \r\ncongratulate our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho has taken many initiatives since he was elected as \r\nthe leader of our Organization, as demonstrated by the \r\nrecent meetings dealing with Africa.  \r\n Many heads of State have referred to the dizzying \r\nincrease in the price of oil, including, just now, the \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic. That is not by \r\nchance, because many of us have denounced the policy \r\nof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \r\n(OPEC), which establishes the price of oil as it wishes \r\nand tries to blame it on the increase in demand — as if \r\nwe had never studied economics.  \r\n The assessments of our association have not been \r\nvery optimistic, but it should be noted that the \r\nobjectives set by the founding Members have not been \r\nachieved. I quote from the birth certificate of our \r\nOrganization that one of the purposes was “to promote \r\nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger \r\nfreedom”. I believe that the United Nations has served \r\nhumanity considerably by resolving some conflicts and \r\nby establishing lasting peace, but we must also \r\nrecognize its shortcomings in many areas, including \r\npeace and in the economic field.  \r\n Today, populations throughout the world have \r\ngreat expectations of our meeting, because humanity, \r\nfortunately, still hopes, and that hope remains alive in \r\nthe countries that are called poor, and indeed they are. \r\nBut I usually say with regard to Africa that it is not \r\npoor, but rather that Africa is a continent that has been \r\nimpoverished over five centuries of slavery and one \r\ncentury of colonization and exploitation. However, \r\ndespite all of that, Africa has engaged itself in \r\ninternational cooperation — bilateral and multilateral. \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 26 \r\n \r\nWe also strive to contribute within the United Nations, \r\nfor example to peace, which is one of the objectives of \r\nour Organization.  \r\n Experience teaches us that there are limits to our \r\ninternational system. As you, Mr. President, and the \r\nSecretary-General have both mentioned, we should \r\nlook directly at the issues and undertake reforms. \r\nAbove all, we must demonstrate imagination and a \r\ncapacity for innovation. \r\n The first issue of concern to us is to feed Africa. \r\nWe must substitute this idea of food aid, which was at \r\nthe origin of the Food and Agriculture Organization of \r\nthe United Nations (FAO), and replace it with the \r\nconcept of assistance to agriculture, because we have \r\ndemonstrated that we are able to carry out agriculture \r\njust like developed countries. Unfortunately, we suffer \r\nfrom certain shortages, including seeds, fertilizer and \r\nequipment, as I will show in a moment. In place of \r\ntraditional financing, we need to imagine what is \r\nreferred to now as innovative financing.  \r\n In June 2008, we raised an alarm over the \r\nincrease in the price of basic commodities and \r\nespecially of food products. The Secretary-General \r\nasked FAO to meet in Rome with heads of State. We \r\ndropped everything in order to go to Rome and respond \r\nto that appeal, believing that real solutions would be \r\nproposed. Solutions were proposed, but we are still \r\nwaiting for them to be implemented. At the same time, \r\nI drew attention to the fact that the countries of the \r\nSahel region have three to four months of rain each \r\nyear, during which time one could grow whatever one \r\nwanted if one had the means to do so. That is followed \r\nby eight or nine months of drought. \r\n We launched that appeal, but like the doctor who \r\narrives after the death, no one responded. Fortunately \r\nfor Senegal, we foresaw difficulties due to the weighty \r\nglobal mechanisms and launched a programme called \r\nthe Great Agricultural Offensive for Agriculture and \r\nAbundance. We were told it was too ambitious because \r\nit amounted to $800 million. \r\n The project, which began at the end of May, will \r\nbe completed in a month. I have the pleasure to inform \r\nthe Assembly that, beyond meeting its food needs, \r\nSenegal has met the challenge of achieving a surplus. \r\nSix months ago, Senegal was among the most food-\r\ndependent countries, importing all its food, including \r\nmore than 600,000 tons of rice annually. But a look at \r\nSenegal today reveals that there is green everywhere. I \r\ncalled on all Senegalese everywhere, including in the \r\nSenegalese diaspora, to farm as much as they \r\nwanted — on 10, 20 or 1,000 hectares — so long as it \r\nwas food. That great offensive, as I have said, has \r\nunquestionably been a great success. The world will \r\nnot see Senegal launching an appeal for food \r\nassistance. We have solved the problem and hope that \r\nwe have solved it once and for all.  \r\n Admittedly, we could not have done it without \r\nGod’s help. The programme required $100 million, a \r\nthird of which was to be devoted to fertilizer. \r\nFortunately, our country is endowed with phosphate \r\ndeposits that can be directly used as fertilizer for crops, \r\nthus enabling us to save one third of the cost of our \r\ninvestment in the programme. This has been possible \r\nbecause of the belief I have adhered to for more than \r\n50 years. I have said for a long time that we could find \r\nphosphate. We have now gone out to find that hidden \r\nwealth. As I said in jest about the previous regimes, \r\nGod had hidden it from them, but we managed to find \r\nit. \r\n Africa has responded to the call to protect the \r\nenvironment. President Obasanjo and I launched the \r\nGreat Green Wall Initiative, whereby a band of trees \r\n15 kilometres wide and 7,000 kilometres long will \r\nstretch from Dakar to Djibouti. Once again, we were \r\ntold that it was a dream. No, as I speak, since, in the \r\nwords of the philosopher, we believe in going forward \r\nby walking, Senegal is in the process of building \r\n587 kilometres of the Great Green Wall. Everyone has \r\nsupported us in this endeavour — France, the United \r\nStates, the European Union — at least in words. We are \r\nlooking forward to your support, especially from the \r\nscientists, who we hope will help us to choose drought-\r\nresistant plants. It is possible. I contacted scientists \r\nthrough the Internet. They came from all over the \r\nworld — Europe, the United States, American \r\nuniversities and Australia. I accordingly called for the \r\nhelp now of the Science Without Borders association. I \r\ninvited scientists to Senegal because their knowledge \r\ncomes free of charge, and they are always willing to \r\nmake it available for the benefit of humankind.  \r\n The Great Green Wall will be backed by what we \r\ncall retention basins. Billions of tons of water that fall \r\nduring the rainy season are lost to runoff or the sea. We \r\nare trying to capture that water, as is being done so \r\nwell in countries such as Burkina Faso. We in Senegal \r\nare making that a systematic effort. The World Bank \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n27 08-51749 \r\n \r\nhas labelled our effort conclusive, and we also want to \r\nbuild a green strip from Dakar to Djibouti. \r\n Africa is therefore responding to the call of the \r\ninternational community to protect the environment. \r\nHowever, I cannot fail to point out that the African \r\ncoast is in the process of disappearing, with several \r\ncentimetres being lost from Morocco to the Gulf of \r\nGuinea each year. In that connection, a first meeting \r\nwas held in Cotonou a few days ago to address the \r\nissue of coastal erosion.  \r\n As the Assembly is aware, the Secretary-General \r\nhas issued a challenge to Africa. Not long ago, the \r\nWorld Bank indicated that five African countries were \r\ncapable of achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, including Senegal. The Secretary-General has \r\nsaid that no African country would achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. I, for my part, \r\nrespond to challenges. I shall meet that challenge for \r\nSenegal, I shall take it up, and that is not a dream. Not \r\nlong ago, Senegal was very far down on the World \r\nBank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. Just a few days \r\nago, thanks to our targeted efforts to overcome our \r\nshortcomings, Senegal was classified as the first \r\ncountry in Africa for doing business, and the fifth in \r\nthe world.  \r\n Child and maternal mortality is one of the \r\nobstacles to overcoming our shortcomings. After \r\ngiving thought to the problem, we decided a week ago \r\nin Senegal that, so long as the problem is left up to the \r\nState, we will not make progress. We have instituted a \r\nnew approach that entails putting in charge a woman in \r\neach neighbourhood of the affected areas to monitor \r\npregnancies and help pregnant women to visit doctors, \r\nas well as to immediately inform the authorities of any \r\nproblems. We hope that will enable us to reduce child \r\nand maternal mortality. We are even going so far as to \r\nprovide cell phones to women in the interior of Senegal \r\nso that they can report cases to health-care centres. \r\n There is also a need to establish a new \r\nmechanism to mobilize resources. That was our goal in \r\nsetting up a pilot group for solidarity levies to fund \r\ndevelopment. We have also launched a digital \r\nsolidarity fund. We Africans have done that, with the \r\nsupport of the entire world. We are therefore on our \r\nway to bridging the digital divide identified by the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n As we begin our work here, more than 1 billion \r\nMuslims throughout the world are fasting in \r\naccordance with one of Islam’s five pillars. Apart from \r\nreligion, for every Muslim the fast is a code of \r\nbehaviour inspired by the lofty values of peace, \r\nsharing, forgiveness, respect and brotherly love, \r\nirrespective of religion. On the basis of the letter and \r\nspirit of the message of Islam, which are being \r\ncelebrated during this Holy month of Ramadan, and in \r\nmy capacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference, I should like here to \r\nreiterate the adherence of the Islamic Umma to the \r\nprinciples of the culture of peace and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. We affirm that we condemn extremism, \r\nviolence, intolerance and discrimination, which are \r\ncontrary to the teachings of Islam and which our \r\nreligion condemns as a source of unhappiness and \r\ndiscord. It is for that reason that we are willing to \r\nengage in a dialogue with all civilizations.  \r\n The United Nations ideal of peace continues to be \r\ntested by the reality of conflicts in the world. Although \r\nwe have certainly seen fewer trouble spots in Africa, \r\nconflict still rages in Chad, the Sudan and Darfur. We, \r\nfor our part, will always continue to give our active \r\nsupport to peace and the United Nations. \r\n Quite sincerely, however, I believe that there will \r\nbe no solution in Darfur until we disarm all armed \r\ngroups, which have been clearly identified. As for \r\nZimbabwe, we welcome the progress that is being \r\nmade. In Mauritania, we, as a neighbouring country, \r\nare very concerned about what is taking place. But I \r\nshould like to reiterate here that we very much believe \r\nin the rule of law of the Republic, in accordance with \r\nthe position outlined by the African Union.  \r\n We are also continuing our efforts in the Middle \r\nEast, as we have been called on to give our support to \r\nintra-Palestinian dialogue and to dialogue between \r\nIsrael and Palestine. \r\n For many years now, I have consistently \r\nbemoaned the ineffectiveness of economic thinking. \r\nThe failure from which we are suffering today is the \r\nfailure of economists and financiers and, more \r\ngenerally, of the intelligentsia. I greatly appreciate the \r\nappeal just made to the intelligentsia made by the \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic.  \r\n I continue to believe that the solution to the crisis \r\nis not to be found in the North; crises begin in the \r\nNorth, but we will not find their solutions in the North. \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 28 \r\n \r\n The global economy moved from Europe to the \r\nUnited States where it created a new centre of \r\ndevelopment that has underpinned the global economy \r\nfor almost 200 years. Now that economy is running out \r\nof steam because of crises like the one we are facing \r\ntoday.  \r\n President Bush has told us about a solution \r\nadvocated by his financiers, but I am sorry: the \r\nsolution to the North’s crisis lies in the South; the \r\nsolution lies in Africa. \r\n Rather than allowing capital to roam in every \r\ndirection to create inflationary situations, I think it \r\nbetter, as a Keynesian thinker, to call on Members to \r\ninvest in the creation of wealth and jobs in Africa, a \r\ncontinent possessed of great material and human \r\nresources and capable of taking its turn as the engine of \r\nthe exhausted global economy. That economy, which \r\nleft Europe for the United States, will finally be \r\ndeveloped in Africa. \r\n That is why we call on the entire world to invest \r\nin Africa because it is there that I sincerely believe that \r\nthe last advances will be achieved. It is true that some \r\ntrouble spots remain — as in every country — but with \r\nthe support of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecretary-General, and with all people of goodwill, we \r\nare sure that Africa will be able to play that role, \r\nprovided of course that Africans are trained as soon as \r\npossible to assume that historic mission. \r\n It is on this note of hope and as Vice-President of \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) and President-in-Office of the Organization \r\nof Islamic Conference (OIC) that I make an appeal to \r\nall countries to continue supporting efforts for peace \r\nand continue supporting investment efforts in Africa. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Senegal for the statement he has just \r\nmade.  \r\n Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n Mr. Pohamba (Namibia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\nAddress by Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Karzai: Since the last time we \r\ngathered here in this great Hall, we have passed a year \r\nof great hopes and grave fears. We have witnessed the \r\nhope-inspiring glory of human accomplishment at the \r\nOlympic Games in Beijing but shuddered at crumbling \r\nstock and housing markets around the world. We have \r\na growing global understanding on climate change and \r\nthe issues relevant to it, but seen millions of lives \r\nthreatened by the shortage of food in many countries \r\nand witnessed with disbelief the brutal slaughter of \r\ninnocent people at the hands of terrorists in \r\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, India, Algeria and several other \r\nparts of the world. \r\n Since I spoke at this rostrum in the last session of \r\nthe General Assembly, my country, Afghanistan, has \r\ngrappled with a number of important challenges, none \r\nmore troubling than the problem of international \r\nterrorism. Terrorist forces have significantly increased \r\ntheir attacks and brutality, and enjoyed freedom in their \r\nsanctuaries. \r\n While Afghanistan has borne the brunt of terrorist \r\nviolence, the scourge has now spread like a wildfire \r\nacross the wider region. In Pakistan, where, until \r\nrecently, extremist circles remained mainly focused on \r\ndestabilizing Afghanistan, today terrorist violence is \r\nunfortunately also directed within Pakistani territory \r\nand against the Pakistani people.  \r\n Daily acts of intimidation and violence against \r\ncommunities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in particular \r\non both sides of the Durand Line, the killing of \r\npolitical and tribal leaders and the burning of schools \r\nare the upshots of the continued spawning and spread \r\nof terrorism and extremism in the region.  \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n29 08-51749 \r\n \r\n The callous attack on the Marriot hotel in \r\nIslamabad over the weekend, the bombing of the Indian \r\nEmbassy in Kabul and the terrorist attacks in the Indian \r\ncities of Bangalore and Ahmedabad were the most \r\ndisturbing demonstration of terrorists’ growing reach. \r\n Undoubtedly, terrorism will not go away until we \r\ndismantle the elaborate institutional support terrorists \r\nenjoy in the region and eliminate their secure \r\nsanctuaries. That will be possible only if we engage in \r\nsincere regional and international cooperation. \r\n The democratic transition in Pakistan, heralded \r\nby the historic elections of last February, has been a \r\nmost promising development in our region. \r\n We in Afghanistan have warmly welcomed the \r\ninauguration of the civilian democratic Government. In \r\nparticular, I take the opportunity to once again \r\ncongratulate my brother, President Asif Ali Zardari, on \r\nhis election as the President of Pakistan. I assure my \r\nbrothers, President Zardari and Prime Minister Gillani, \r\nthat Afghanistan stands ready to take several steps for \r\neach single step that Pakistan will take to address the \r\nchallenge of radicalism and terrorism. \r\n To the extent that terrorism in our region \r\ncontinues to be a global threat, evolving in nature and \r\ntactics, the struggle against it must continue unabated. \r\nIn this context, I recall with appreciation this year’s \r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit in \r\nBucharest, where around 40 countries with existing \r\nmilitary commitments in Afghanistan once again \r\nreiterated their strong resolve to stay the course. \r\n Among the most significant outcomes of the \r\nsummit was the emphasis on the Afghanization of the \r\nsecurity sector as a measure to ensure sustainability \r\nand enhanced effectiveness. To that end, I call for a \r\nredoubling of efforts by the international community \r\naimed at enabling the Afghan national security \r\ninstitutions, both the army and the police, to take on a \r\ngreater share of the war against terrorism and for the \r\nprotection of our people. \r\n Above all, Afghanization of military operations is \r\nvital if the problem of civilian casualties is to be \r\naddressed effectively. The continuation of civilian \r\ncasualties could seriously undermine the legitimacy of \r\nthe fight against terrorism and the credibility of the \r\nAfghan people’s partnership with the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Whereas the military endeavour at the regional \r\nand international levels remains the primary response \r\nto the threat of terrorism, success will only be possible \r\nif the local population is empowered to confront it. \r\nTherefore, while terrorism and a persistent \r\nenvironment of insecurity are at work to subvert \r\nAfghanistan’s growth, we must do what it takes to win \r\nthe battle of Afghanistan’s economic development.  \r\n Last June, my Government launched the \r\nAfghanistan National Development Strategy at the \r\nAfghanistan donors conference in Paris. If the pledges \r\nmade at the conference are translated into timely \r\ncommitments, I am confident that we will attain the \r\ndevelopment goals set out in our Strategy. \r\n On behalf of the people of Afghanistan, I thank \r\nPresident Nicholas Sarkozy of France for his \r\nleadership in excellently organizing the Paris \r\nconference. I also thank the United States and all the \r\nother countries around the world that pledged \r\ngenerously towards the implementation of the \r\nAfghanistan National Development Strategy. \r\n As in the security sector, Afghanization of the \r\ndevelopment process is the key not just to the goal of \r\nensuring ownership but also to the effective \r\nimplementation of our Development Strategy. \r\nAfghanization of the development process can be \r\nachieved through a meaningful commitment by our \r\nfriends and donors to aid effectiveness. In that context, \r\nwhile urging a shift away from the use of parallel \r\nstructures and wasteful mechanisms, I strongly endorse \r\nthe role of the United Nations and the special \r\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kai Eide, \r\nin coordinating the international community’s \r\nparticipation in Afghanistan’s development and State-\r\nbuilding processes. \r\n Thanks to the selfless sacrifices of men and \r\nwomen of Member States and the determination and \r\nsacrifices of our own people, the journey of \r\nAfghanistan’s reconstruction is resolutely under way. \r\nToday our people are more educated, healthier, better \r\noff and more optimistic about their future. We have \r\nbuilt thousands of new schools and reconstructed many \r\nmore, where millions of our youngsters go to school \r\nand prepare for the responsibilities of tomorrow. Our \r\nrapid economic growth, with double-digit growth rates \r\nalmost every year, has resulted in higher income and \r\nbetter living conditions for our people. Our rural \r\ndevelopment programmes have improved lives in \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 30 \r\n \r\nthousands of our villages that had never before seen an \r\nagent of the State among them. \r\n We have also taken a number of legal and \r\ninstitutional measures to intensify our anti-corruption \r\nefforts, such as establishing the High Office of \r\nOversight and Anti-Corruption, including special units \r\nin the Office of the Attorney-General and in the \r\njudiciary to oversee efforts aimed at eliminating \r\ncorruption through preventive, educational and \r\nenforcement measures. We are committed to ensuring \r\nmore concrete results in the coming years. \r\n Also very important, on counter-narcotics, this \r\nyear we have registered a 20 per cent decline in total \r\nopium production, while the number of poppy-free \r\nprovinces has reached 18, making 50 per cent of the \r\ncountry virtually poppy-free. The key to sustaining our \r\nsuccess will be ensuring alternative livelihoods for our \r\nfarmers, investing to a greater extent in law \r\nenforcement and interdiction and, above all, addressing \r\nthe far greater dimensions of the world’s drug trade \r\nthat lie outside Afghanistan, such as reduction of \r\ndemand in foreign markets and stricter border controls. \r\n Our efforts in counter-narcotics and in other areas \r\nhave been complicated by the acute shortage of food \r\nwithin the country. In collaboration with the United \r\nNations, we have launched a humanitarian appeal that \r\nwe hope will receive a timely response from our \r\npartners in the international community. \r\n The United Nations Charter promises freedom, \r\njustice, a dignified life, security and peace, and it is \r\nincumbent on all of us to work together to ensure that \r\nthose promises are kept. Today, there are still too many \r\ncorners of the world where conflict and tension are \r\nputting the lives and livelihoods of millions of people \r\nin jeopardy.  \r\n We deeply sympathize with our Palestinian \r\nbrothers and sisters and their struggle and suffering. \r\nWe urge a just and comprehensive settlement that fully \r\nrealizes the rights of the Palestinian people, including \r\ntheir right to an independent State, living in peace, side \r\nby side with the State of Israel. \r\n Today, once again, this Assembly session has \r\nbrought us together at a time when our world is poised \r\nbetween great opportunities and menacing challenges. I \r\nam confident that we will make use of our growing \r\ncollective ability as a community of nations to do what \r\nis right for the betterment of our world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Hâmid Karzai, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of \r\nBurkina Faso \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Burkina Faso. \r\n Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Blaise Compaore, \r\nPresident of Burkina Faso, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Compaore (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to warmly congratulate Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\non his election to preside over our debates and to \r\nassure him of the full support of Burkina Faso. I would \r\nalso like to express to his predecessor, Mr. Kerim, all \r\nmy appreciation for the skill with which he guided the \r\nwork of the sixty-second session.  \r\n It is also my pleasure to pay well-deserved tribute \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who is \r\ninvesting his efforts with foresight and dedication to \r\nensure the success of the reform of our Organization in \r\norder to build a safer world and to ensure continuing \r\nprogress. I would like to reiterate in particular our \r\nwarm thanks to him for the visit he made to our \r\ncountry last April. \r\n This session of the General Assembly is taking \r\nplace at the midpoint in the timetable for attaining the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and in an international \r\ncontext marked by threats to global peace. The food \r\nand energy crises have been joined by a financial crisis \r\nof exceptional seriousness. This session is therefore \r\ncrucial and provides us with a great opportunity to \r\nassess the measures that have been taken and to take \r\nthe necessary corrective measures.  \r\n In that respect, I welcome the initiative to \r\norganize a high-level meeting on the midterm review \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. The \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n31 08-51749 \r\n \r\nconclusions of that meeting, I firmly believe, will help \r\nus to establish appropriate strategies to speed up the \r\nachievement of the Goals.  \r\n The current food crisis throughout the world has \r\namply demonstrated the ineffectiveness of our \r\nagricultural policies and the fragility of our production \r\nand trading systems. It is urgent to improve how \r\ninternational institutions function, to relaunch \r\ninvestment in agriculture and to support farmers’ and \r\nprofessional organizations in innovative partnerships. \r\nTo that end, it is important that we commit ourselves to \r\nmajor investment in farming, improved organization \r\nfor producers, greater control of water resources, more \r\neffective distribution of seeds and fertilizers, and \r\nsimpler access to land. \r\n The energy crisis helps us to prioritize our search \r\nfor lasting solutions in favour of renewable \r\nresources — solar, nuclear, wind and bioenergy \r\nresources — because of the impact of energy-related \r\nfactors on States’ development strategies. \r\n Official development assistance has decreased in \r\nrecent years in terms of the level of funding and its \r\neffectiveness. Beyond the central and recurring \r\nquestion of the level of official development \r\nassistance, there are four other dimensions that I \r\nbelieve are crucial. Those dimensions are, first, \r\nownership of economic policies and support for \r\ncapacity-building in governance in our States; \r\nsecondly, harmonizing and simplifying donor \r\nprocedures; thirdly, the gradual alignment of assistance \r\nwith national development priorities and programmes; \r\nand fourthly, improved coordination between our \r\ntechnical and financial partners on the ground, under \r\nthe leadership of Governments.  \r\n Those are the main requirements with regard to \r\nensuring more effective public aid. I take this \r\nopportunity to express my thanks to all our \r\ndevelopment partners who have always supported us as \r\nwe strive for encouraging results. \r\n The scourge of drugs and narcotics is a threat to \r\nAfrica in general and the West African subregion in \r\nparticular. Used as departure and transit points for \r\nexporting illegal drugs, some parts of our countries are \r\nexperiencing a genuine cross-border crime wave. The \r\nrapid eradication of that scourge requires the solidarity \r\nand active support of the international community. \r\n With regard to environmental issues, the \r\ninternational community must invest more if it is to \r\nbring appropriate responses to the climate change \r\naffecting our planet. Scientific and political ideas must \r\nbe aimed today at protecting and preserving a fully \r\nfunctioning ecosystem for future generations. \r\n Resolving conflicts throughout the world, and \r\nparticularly on the African continent, represents a \r\nmajor challenge for the community of nations. Burkina \r\nFaso, which currently holds the presidency of the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the \r\nWest African Economic and Monetary Union is making \r\nits contribution to enhancing peace and security, which \r\nare indispensable to ensuring progress and democracy. \r\nIn Africa, centres of tension remain, but we can \r\nwelcome the remarkable progress achieved by \r\nnumerous mediation efforts in various regions, which \r\nhave demonstrated the capacity of Africans to resolve \r\ntheir disputes for themselves. \r\n In Darfur, the Security Council’s decision has \r\nallowed the deployment of the African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation. Burkina Faso, which is \r\ntaking part in that peacekeeping operation, welcomes \r\nthe appointment of Mr. Djibril Yipènè Bassolé as the \r\nJoint African Union-United Nations Chief Mediator for \r\nDarfur. Given the complexity of his mission, I call on \r\nthe international community to give him its full support \r\nand to ensure a rapid resumption of the political \r\ndialogue and to strengthen the operational capacities of \r\nthe hybrid force. \r\n We are also concerned by the erosion of the \r\nSomali State and its post-electoral crises. With regard \r\nto Western Sahara, we are encouraged by the efforts \r\nmade by the parties to the conflict, particularly the \r\nKingdom of Morocco, and by the Security Council’s \r\ncall for a realistic settlement.  \r\n The Sahelo-Saharan region has been affected by \r\npersistent insecurity for many years. Collective efforts \r\nat dialogue and cooperation are required to restore \r\npeace and security there. In that regard, we welcome \r\nand support the Algiers accord reached recently \r\nbetween the Government of Mali and the Tuareg \r\nrebels.  \r\n Burkina Faso also welcomes the progress made in \r\nthe Middle East. The strengthening of Lebanese \r\nsovereignty, the creation of a viable Palestinian State \r\nand security guarantees for Israel will contribute to \r\nestablishing lasting peace in that region. \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 32 \r\n \r\n With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, I hope \r\nthat reason will prevail and that negotiations will \r\nreconcile Iran’s rights to civil nuclear power and the \r\nlegitimate fears of the international community with \r\nregard to military nuclear proliferation.  \r\n In Afghanistan and Iraq, the situation continues to \r\nbe tragic and to claim new victims every day, most of \r\nwhom are innocent civilians. Burkina Faso will \r\ncontinue to invest with the entire international \r\ncommunity in re-establishing peace in those countries. \r\n The news today is dominated by the conflict \r\ntaking place in the Caucasus. While reasserting its \r\nsupport for negotiations by the European Union, \r\nBurkina Faso hopes that the solution to the crisis will \r\nbe based on inclusive dialogue and respect for \r\ninternational legality.  \r\n I note with pleasure an improvement in relations \r\nbetween the Republic of China or Taiwan and the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China. I deeply hope that this \r\nnew spirit will open the way to Taiwan’s participation \r\nin the activities of international organizations. \r\n For many years now, the United Nations has been \r\ncommitted to a process of reforms that should lead to \r\nthe improved effectiveness of its activities in the face \r\nof the demands of the modern world. Despite the \r\nprogress that has been made, much remains to be done. \r\nOur resolve to reach that goal must remain constant. \r\n Burkina Faso has deep faith in multilateralism \r\nand solidarity among peoples. We reassert our \r\nwillingness to make our contribution wherever it is \r\nrequested to maintain and consolidate peace, \r\ndevelopment and democracy. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Burkina \r\nFaso for the statement he has just made.  \r\n  Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Shimon Peres, President of the State \r\nof Israel \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the State of Israel. \r\n  Mr. Shimon Peres, President of the State of Israel, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Shimon Peres, President of \r\nthe State of Israel, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Peres: Over 60 years have passed \r\nsince the General Assembly voted on the historic \r\nresolution that would have put an end to the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict. Resolution 181 (II) called for the \r\nestablishment of a Jewish State and an Arab State. Its \r\ntitle was: “Plan of Partition with Economic Union”. It \r\nenvisioned two States for two peoples, fulfilling a \r\ndistinct national aspiration. The Jewish people adopted \r\nthe resolution and established the State of Israel. The \r\nArabs rejected it, and this led to war. \r\n What happened in the ensuing years is much \r\ndifferent from the resolution’s original intent. While \r\nmuch has changed since then, the ironies of history \r\nsummon similar circumstances today. Today, again, we \r\nare in the middle of the lake. There is no sense going \r\nback. Continuing forward will show how near we are \r\nto achieving the initial goal. \r\n A year prior to Israel’s declaration of statehood, \r\nits first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, called me, \r\na young man from a kibbutz, to serve in our national \r\ndefence. Since then, I have participated in Israel’s \r\ndynamic realities: the building of security; the striving \r\nfor peace. So, I need no books to learn the history, \r\nsince I witnessed its miraculous unfolding. We went \r\nthrough seven wars. All have paid heavily. Tears still \r\nflow down the faces of bereaved mothers. \r\nRemembrance days fill the air with silent prayers of \r\nwidowed families who lost young boys and girls in \r\nbattle. They are, today, the same age, but lifeless.  \r\n Israel turned military victories into peace \r\nprocesses, knowing that the cost of life renders \r\nimperfect peace superior to perfect victories. \r\n We have also achieved two peace agreements: the \r\nfirst, with the largest Arab country, Egypt; the second, \r\nwith the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. All the land, \r\nall the water, all the natural resources that fell into our \r\nhands through war were completely repatriated after \r\npeace was signed.  \r\n But for peace, the call in our region is to repair \r\nthe damaged environment and the wounded land which \r\nleads to poverty. If we do not overcome the desert, the \r\nthirst, the pollution, they will overcome us. Joint \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n33 08-51749 \r\n \r\nventures can meet this call. Nature does not carry a \r\nnational passport. \r\n With the Palestinians, we negotiate full peace. \r\nBoth parties agreed to building a Palestinian State side \r\nby side with Israel, living in peace, security and \r\nrespect. We tried to conclude those negotiations this \r\nyear. Apparently, this will take a longer time. I believe \r\nit can be accomplished, in spite of this, within the next \r\nyear. \r\n I know that our Prime Minister is more than \r\nready to conclude an agreement. And knowing \r\nPresident Abbas as well, I am sure he will not miss this \r\nopportunity. We agreed to progress in spite of possible \r\nchanges that may take place in the leadership. Gaps \r\nhave been narrowed through negotiations, particularly, \r\nand hopefully, the territorial ones. \r\n But peace is not just a matter of territorial \r\ncompromise. Rogue politics rejects peace even when \r\nand where territorial disputes have been resolved. In \r\nLebanon, we implemented the resolutions of the United \r\nNations, but Hizbullah paralysed the country and cut \r\nthe road to peace. \r\n From Gaza, we withdrew completely and \r\ndismantled all of our settlements. I know there are a \r\ngreat many complaints about the settlements: in Gaza, \r\nwe dismantled 30 settlements by order of the \r\nGovernment; Hamas responded with a bloody takeover \r\nand turned the Strip into a base for rocket fire. \r\n These militants offer no positive alternative but \r\nthe agonies of Job. They added kidnapping to \r\nbombings, bringing strife to innocent families. From \r\nthis rostrum, I call for the immediate release of Gilad \r\nShalit, the son of Aviva and Noam, a most peace-loving \r\nfamily. This Assembly should place the release of that \r\nperson at the top of its priorities. Holding a hostage in \r\nGaza, causes Gaza’s isolation and could cause further \r\ndeterioration. \r\n At the centre of this violence and fanaticism \r\nstands Iran. It presents a danger to the entire world. Its \r\nquest for religious hegemony and regional dominance \r\ndivides the Middle East and holds back chances for \r\npeace, including among Arabs, while undermining \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Iranian support for Hizbullah divides Lebanon. \r\nIts support for Hamas splits the Palestinians; it \r\npostpones the establishment of the Palestinian State. \r\nYesterday, from this very rostrum, the Iranian leader \r\nrenewed the darkest anti-Semitic libel — the \r\n“Protocols of the Elders of Zion” — bringing to life \r\none of the ugliest plots against the Jewish people. Their \r\ndespicable denial of the Holocaust is a mockery of \r\nindisputable evidence and a cynical offence against the \r\nsurvivors of the Holocaust, contrary to the resolutions \r\nadopted by this very Assembly. \r\n Iran continues to develop enriched uranium and \r\nlong-range missiles. It has introduced a religion of fear, \r\nopposing the call of the Lord to respect human life: all \r\nhumans; all life. The Iranian people are not our \r\nenemies. Their fanatical leadership is their problem \r\nand the world’s woe. Their leader is a danger to his \r\nown people, to the region and to the world. He is a \r\ndisgrace to the ancient Iranian people and tradition. He \r\nis a disgrace to the values of Islam and all religions. He \r\nis a disgrace to this House, the United Nations, and its \r\nbasic principles and values. His appearance here is a \r\nshame.  \r\n The Jewish people have known throughout \r\nhistory that they must stand firm and face evil. \r\nEnlightened humanity should make it possible for \r\nfreedom and respect to prevail for all of us.  \r\n Tehran combines long-range missiles with short-\r\nrange minds. It is pregnant with tragedies. The General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council bear the \r\nresponsibility to prevent agonies before they take \r\nplace.  \r\n Israel has shown that democracies can defend \r\nthemselves. We are able to defend ourselves. We do not \r\nintend to change that capacity to defend ourselves.  \r\n Terrorism has not solved a single problem. It \r\nnever has; it never will. It will make the world \r\nungovernable. If groups of killers are allowed to \r\nthreaten innocent masses, the world — if it continues \r\nto survive — will be without order and security, a \r\nhopeless battleground. The free world must unite to \r\nstop this, to combat it. \r\n Israel, for its part, shall continue to seek peace \r\nsincerely and fully. We suggest immediate peace with \r\nLebanon. Israeli Prime Ministers have indicated to \r\nSyria that, for peace, we are ready to explore a \r\ncomprehensive compromise. To gain trust and save \r\ntime, we have suggested a face-to-face meeting with \r\nPresident Assad. I say to the President: “Follow the \r\nsuccessful example set by President Sadat and King \r\nHussein”. We await an answer. \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 34 \r\n \r\n I know there is a growing concern that peace is \r\nfar away. My lifelong experience provides me with a \r\ndifferent judgement. True, I have seen stagnation, \r\nregression and failure in our journey, but today I can \r\nidentify a road leading in the right direction. In \r\naddition to the peace agreements, a series of summits \r\nhave taken place: Madrid, Oslo, Wye, Camp David, \r\nSharm el-Sheik, Annapolis. In fact, Israelis and Arabs \r\nare marching towards peace. After a long internal \r\ndebate, Israel has chosen to support the two-State \r\nsolution. \r\n Furthermore, I must say that in Beirut, the Arab \r\nLeague replaced the three “nays” of Khartoum — \r\nwhich were no peace, no negotiation, no recognition — \r\nwith an initiative inaugurated by King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud. I call upon the King to further his \r\ninitiative. It may become an invitation for \r\ncomprehensive peace — one to transform a \r\nbattleground into a common ground. \r\n I respectfully invite all leaders to come to discuss \r\npeace in Jerusalem — which is holy to all of us — \r\nwhere all of us are praying to the same Lord as \r\noffspring of the same Father. Israel shall gladly accept \r\nan Arab invitation to designate a venue where a \r\nmeaningful dialogue may take place at their choice. \r\n We are facing a serious economic crisis in the \r\nworld. Perhaps it has happened because we are rich and \r\nlight with funds and poor and heavy with ideas, while \r\nwe live in an era in which science, not land, is the basis \r\nfor a successful economy. Science does not stop at \r\nborders; it is not disturbed by distances. Wisdom \r\ncannot be conquered by armies. Knowledge diminishes \r\ndiscrimination because it operates through goodwill \r\nand transcends race, nationality, colour and gender. \r\n The global dangers unite and divide us at the \r\nsame time. The dangers are clear: degradation of the \r\nenvironment, shortage of water, lack of renewable \r\nenergy, the spread of terrorism and, alas, increased \r\npoverty among millions and millions of people. The \r\ndivisions of the free world may increase them. Unity \r\nmay offer alternatives. It would direct global \r\ninvestments to new areas and to demanding challenges \r\nsuch as health, security, education and the \r\nenvironment. \r\n The future is not in the hands of oil or gold. \r\nIntellectual assets, new inventions and superior \r\neducation hold the key to the future of each of us. In \r\nour region, border areas could become open economic \r\nzones, permitting the free movement of people, \r\ncommodities and ideas. They could encourage tourism \r\nand build high-tech incubators. They could cultivate \r\nand advance modern agriculture. Economic zones \r\nwould provide a million jobs and produce billions of \r\ncubic metres of desalinated water for the Arabs, for the \r\nPalestinians, for the Jordanians, for Israel — for all of \r\nus. We have already started to do this; the initial steps \r\nare promising. \r\n The Jewish people are celebrating a New Year. I \r\nwould like to end with a quote by Rabbi Nachman of \r\nBreslav: \r\n “May it be thy will to remove war and bloodshed \r\nfrom the world and perpetuate the wonders and \r\ngreatness of peace. All the inhabitants of the \r\nworld shall recognize and know the truth: that we \r\nhave not been placed on this earth to wage war \r\nand not for hatred or bloodshed.” \r\nI will repeat it in Hebrew. \r\n (The speaker repeated the quote in Hebrew)  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the State of \r\nIsrael for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Shimon Peres, President of the State of Israel, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the \r\nState Council of the People’s Republic of China \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Premier of the State \r\nCouncil of the People’s Republic of China. \r\n Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the State Council of \r\nthe People’s Republic of China was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.  \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Wen Jiabao, \r\nPremier of the State Council of the People’s Republic \r\nof China, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Wen Jiabao (China) (spoke in Chinese): For \r\nChina, this has been a special year. We experienced \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n35 08-51749 \r\n \r\ntwo major events. One was the devastating earthquake \r\nin Wenchuan, which caused grave loss of life and \r\nproperty. In the face of the disaster, the Chinese people \r\nshowed great strength, courage, solidarity and \r\nresilience. By now, the people affected by the \r\nearthquake have been properly relocated and recovery \r\nand reconstruction work is well under way. The other \r\nevent was the successful hosting of the Beijing \r\nOlympic Games. That grand sporting event provided a \r\ngood opportunity for athletes from around the world to \r\nshow true sportsmanship. It also enabled the world to \r\nlearn more about China and for China to learn more \r\nabout the world.  \r\n In our fight against the earthquake disaster and \r\nour efforts to host the Games, we received \r\nunderstanding, support and assistance from the \r\ninternational community. I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to express sincere gratitude on behalf of \r\nthe Chinese Government and people.  \r\n Now the whole world wants to know in what \r\ndirection China is heading, both politically and \r\neconomically, after the Beijing Olympic Games. Let \r\nme tell you in unequivocal terms that China will \r\nremain committed to the path of peaceful development, \r\nunswervingly pursue reform and opening-up, and \r\ncontinue to adhere to an independent foreign policy of \r\npeace. This is in the fundamental interests of the \r\nChinese people and the people of all other countries. It \r\nis also in keeping with the trend of the world. \r\n The Olympic Games that just concluded were \r\nheld in China, the largest developing country in the \r\nworld. The international community has highly \r\ncommended the efforts made by the Chinese \r\nGovernment and people for the Games, and their \r\nsuccess has greatly inspired the Chinese people and \r\ngiven them even more confidence and strength to \r\nachieve modernization of the country.  \r\n At the same time, however, we are soberly aware \r\nthat China is a country with 1.3 billion people. \r\nAlthough its total GDP is one of the highest in the \r\nworld, it trails behind more than 100 countries in terms \r\nof per capita income. Development between urban and \r\nrural areas and among different regions in China is \r\nunbalanced. The rural areas, particularly in western \r\nChina, are underdeveloped. Tens of millions of Chinese \r\nlack adequate food and clothing.  \r\n China is still a developing country, where \r\nproductivity remains low and further development is \r\nconstrained by the shortage of resources and energy \r\nand by environmental consequences. Our socialist \r\nmarket economic system, democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw need to be further improved, and certain \r\noutstanding social issues are yet to be resolved. To \r\nachieve China’s modernization is a daunting task, and \r\nwe still have a long way to go. Both the opportunities \r\nand challenges that we face are unprecedented. We will \r\nseize the opportunities, rise up to challenges, dedicate \r\nourselves to nation-building and focus on development. \r\nThat is what the Chinese Government and people have \r\nbeen thinking and doing. \r\n People may ask how China is achieving its \r\ndevelopment. The answer is through reform and \r\nopening up. This year marks the thirtieth anniversary \r\nof China’s reform and opening-up policy, a policy that \r\nfundamentally changed the closed, backward and \r\nossified situation that had existed in China for years. It \r\nis a policy that freed people’s minds and aroused their \r\ninitiative, liberated the productive forces, generated \r\ngreat economic and social progress and instilled vigour \r\nand vitality into the country. Without that policy, there \r\nwould not have been such change in China in the last \r\n30 years.  \r\n To achieve the goal of modernization and build a \r\nstrong, prosperous, democratic, culturally advanced \r\nand harmonious country, we will pursue the reform and \r\nopening-up policy. It is of vital importance to the \r\ndevelopment of China today. It is also a strategy that \r\nwill shape China’s future. We are firm in carrying this \r\npolicy forward. \r\n The Chinese nation has all along cherished the \r\nfine tradition and benefited from the wisdom of being \r\nopen to new ideas and drawing on the strengths of \r\nothers. The Chinese people have learned from 30 years \r\nof reform and opening up that only continued \r\neconomic and political restructuring and reform in \r\nother fields can lead to sustained economic growth and \r\nsocial progress. And only continued opening up in an \r\nall-round way can lead the country to greater national \r\nstrength and prosperity. This is the conclusion we have \r\ndrawn both from our practice and exploration and from \r\nhistorical experiences. \r\n The world needs peace, for only with peace can \r\nthere be development. China earnestly hopes to have a \r\npeaceful international environment in order to achieve \r\nits development goals. The Chinese Government is \r\ncommitted to an independent foreign policy of peace \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 36 \r\n \r\nand stands ready to work with other countries to \r\nadvance the noble cause of the peace and progress of \r\nmankind. \r\n Respect for sovereignty and non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of other countries is the prerequisite \r\nfor sound State-to-State relations. The Chinese people \r\nhave learned from their modern history of humiliation \r\nthat when a country loses its sovereignty, its people \r\nlose dignity and status. China is firm in upholding its \r\nhard-won sovereignty and territorial integrity and will \r\nnever tolerate any external interference. Following the \r\nprinciple of treating each other as equals, China also \r\nrespects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nother countries, as well as the independent choices of \r\ntheir people for their own social systems and \r\ndevelopment paths. \r\n China is ready to develop friendly relations with \r\nall countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit \r\nrather than on ideology or on a political system. In \r\nhandling international affairs, we make our own \r\njudgement on the merit of each case and take our \r\nposition in light of our national interests and the well-\r\nbeing of the world’s people. We will neither blindly \r\nfollow the position of others nor give way to the \r\npressure of any forces. In international relations, China \r\ndoes not seek to build alliances or become a leader and \r\nwill never do so in the future. \r\n Peaceful settlement of international disputes is a \r\nfounding purpose of the United Nations and a basic \r\nprinciple of international law. China is committed to \r\naddressing historical issues and current differences \r\nwith other countries through dialogue and negotiation. \r\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council, China \r\nwill continue to play an active and constructive role in \r\npromoting the peaceful settlement of international \r\nhotspot issues and regional conflicts. \r\n China’s development is peaceful in nature. It will \r\nnot harm anyone or pose a threat to anyone. China does \r\nnot seek hegemony now, nor will it do so in the future. \r\nChina keeps and develops an appropriate level of \r\nmilitary capability solely for the purpose of \r\nsafeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity. \r\n The confidence and pride of the Chinese nation \r\ntoday are based on China’s economic development, \r\nsocial justice, the civility of its people and moral \r\nstrength. China will, through its own development, \r\ncontribute to the peace and development of the world. \r\n In the long history of humankind, the destinies of \r\ncountries have never been so closely linked as they are \r\ntoday. Given the global nature of issues threatening the \r\nsurvival and development of mankind, such as global \r\nwarming, environmental degradation, resource \r\nconstraints, frequent outbreaks of diseases and natural \r\ndisasters and the spread of terrorism, and in the face of \r\nthe intertwining challenges related to finance, energy \r\nand food, no country can expect to avoid difficulties or \r\nto handle the problems alone.  \r\n Ongoing financial volatility, in particular, has \r\naffected many countries, and its impact is likely to \r\nbecome more serious. To tackle the challenge, we must \r\nall make concerted efforts. So long as people of all \r\ncountries, including their leaders, can do away with \r\nhostility, exclusion and prejudice, treat each other with \r\nsincerity and an open mind and forge ahead hand in \r\nhand, humankind will overcome all difficulties and \r\nembrace a brighter and better future. \r\n China, as a responsible major developing country, \r\nis ready to work with other members of the \r\ninternational community to strengthen cooperation, \r\nshare opportunities, meet challenges and contribute to \r\nthe harmonious and sustainable development of the \r\nworld. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Premier of \r\nthe State Council of the People’s Republic of China for \r\nthe statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the State Council of \r\nthe People’s Republic of China, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. José Ramón Machado Ventura, \r\nFirst Vice-President of the Republic of Cuba \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the First Vice-President of \r\nthe Council of State and Ministers of the Republic of \r\nCuba. \r\n Mr. José Ramón Machado Ventura, First Vice-\r\nPresident of the Council of State and Ministers of \r\nthe Republic of Cuba, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. José Ramón \r\nMachado Ventura, First Vice-President of the Council \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n37 08-51749 \r\n \r\nof State and Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Machado Ventura (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Mr. President, on behalf of Cuba, I would \r\nlike to congratulate you on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n We are living at a decisive moment in the history \r\nof humankind. The threats looming over the world put \r\nthe very existence of the human species at risk. \r\n The promotion of peace, solidarity, social justice \r\nand sustainable development is the only way to ensure \r\nthe future. The prevailing world order, unjust and \r\nunsustainable, must be replaced by a new system that \r\nis truly democratic and equitable, based on respect for \r\ninternational law and on the principles of solidarity and \r\njustice, putting an end to the inequalities and exclusion \r\nto which the great majorities of the population of our \r\nplanet have been condemned. \r\n There are no alternatives. Those responsible for \r\nthis state of affairs — the industrialized countries, and \r\nin particular the lone super-Power — must shoulder \r\ntheir responsibilities. Fabulous fortunes cannot \r\ncontinue to be wasted while millions of human beings \r\nare starving or dying of curable diseases. It is not \r\npossible to continue to pollute the air and poison the \r\noceans, which is destroying the living conditions for \r\nfuture generations. Neither the peoples nor the planet \r\nitself will permit that without great social upheavals \r\nand extremely grave natural disasters. \r\n Wars of conquest, aggression against and the \r\nillegal occupation of countries, military intervention \r\nand the bombing of innocent civilians, the unbridled \r\narms race, the pillaging and usurpation of the natural \r\nresources of the Third World and the imperial offensive \r\nto crush the resistance of peoples who are defending \r\ntheir rights constitute the greatest and most serious \r\nthreats to international peace and security. \r\n Concepts such as the limitation of sovereignty, \r\npre-emptive war and regime change are expressions of \r\nthe desire to mutilate the independence of our \r\ncountries. The so-called war on terrorism and the \r\nalleged promotion of freedoms serve as pretexts for \r\naggression, military occupation, torture, arbitrary \r\ndetention, the denial of the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination, unjust blockades, unilaterally imposed \r\nsanctions and the imposition of political, economic and \r\nsocial models that facilitate imperial domination with \r\nflagrant disdain for history, cultures and the sovereign \r\nwill of peoples. \r\n The gap between the rich and the poor widens \r\ndaily. The very modest Millennium Development Goals \r\nare an unattainable dream for the vast majority. While \r\n$1 trillion is spent on weapons worldwide, more than \r\n850 million human beings are starving, 1.1 billion have \r\nno access to drinking water, 2.6 billion lack sewage \r\nservices and more than 800 million are illiterate. More \r\nthan 640 million children lack adequate housing, \r\n115 million do not attend primary school and \r\n10 million die before reaching the age of 5, in most \r\ncases as the result of diseases that can be cured.  \r\n With increasing frequency, the populations of the \r\nSouth are suffering from natural disasters, whose \r\nconsequences have been worsened by climate change. \r\nHaiti, Jamaica, Cuba and other countries of the \r\nCaribbean are examples. We issue a special call for \r\nsolidarity with the brotherly people of Haiti in their \r\ntragic situation. \r\n The rise in oil prices is the result of irrational \r\nconsumption, heavy speculative activity and imperial \r\nmilitary adventures. The desperate search for new \r\nsources of energy has propelled the criminal strategy \r\ndriven by the Government of the United States to \r\ntransform grains and cereals into fuel. \r\n For many of the countries of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the situation is becoming unsustainable. \r\nOur nations have suffered and will have to continue to \r\nsuffer the consequences of the irrationality, \r\nwastefulness and speculation of a few countries in the \r\nindustrialized North, which are responsible for the \r\nworld food crisis. They imposed trade liberalization \r\nand financial prescriptions of structural adjustment on \r\nthe developing countries. They caused the ruin of many \r\nsmall producers; they denied — and in some cases \r\ndestroyed — nascent agricultural development in the \r\ncountries of the South, turning them into net importers \r\nof food.  \r\n It is they who continue scandalous agricultural \r\nsubsidies while imposing their rules on international \r\ntrade. They set prices, monopolize technologies, \r\nimpose unjust certifications and manipulate \r\ndistribution channels, financing sources and trade. \r\nThey control transport, scientific research, gene pools \r\nand the production of fertilizers and pesticides. \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 38 \r\n \r\n We have not come here to complain. We have \r\ncome, on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, to support and defend the demands of \r\nbillions of human beings who are calling for justice \r\nand respect for their rights. The formula is not difficult; \r\nnor does it require great sacrifices. All that is needed is \r\nthe necessary political will, less selfishness and the \r\nobjective understanding that, if we do not act today, the \r\nconsequences could be apocalyptic and would also \r\naffect the rich and powerful. That is why Cuba, on \r\nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, \r\ncalls once again on the Governments of developed \r\ncountries to honour their commitments. In particular, \r\nwe urge them to do the following.  \r\n They should put an end to the wars of occupation \r\nand to the plundering of the resources of the countries \r\nof the Third World, and should free up at least a part of \r\ntheir millions in military spending so that those \r\nresources can be allocated to international assistance \r\nfor the benefit of sustainable development. \r\n We urge them to cancel the foreign debt of \r\ndeveloping countries, which has already been paid \r\nmore than once. That would release additional \r\nresources that could be devoted to economic \r\ndevelopment and social programmes. \r\n They should honour the commitment to allocate \r\nat least 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to \r\nofficial development assistance without conditions, so \r\nthat the countries of the South could use those \r\nresources for their national priorities. They should also \r\npromote access on the part of poor countries to \r\nsubstantial new financing. \r\n They are urged to devote one fourth of the money \r\nthat is wasted each year on commercial advertising to \r\nfood production, which would provide nearly \r\n$250 billion more to fight hunger and malnutrition. \r\n They should allocate the money being used for \r\nagricultural subsidies in the North to agricultural \r\ndevelopment in the South. Thus, our countries would \r\nhave approximately $1 billion per day at their disposal \r\nto invest in food production. \r\n We urge them to comply with the commitments \r\nset out in the Kyoto Protocol and to establish more \r\nambitious emission-reduction targets beginning in \r\n2012, without seeking to increase restrictions on \r\ncountries that, even now, maintain far lower per capita \r\nemission levels than those of the countries of the \r\nNorth.  \r\n They should promote access by Third World \r\ncountries to technology and should support the training \r\nof their human resources. Today, on the other hand, \r\nqualified personnel from the South are subjected to \r\nunfair competition and incentives resulting from \r\ndiscriminatory and selective migration policies \r\nimplemented by the United States and Europe. \r\n Something that is today more urgent than ever is \r\nthe establishment of a democratic and equitable \r\ninternational order and a fair and transparent trading \r\nsystem in which all States can participate, in \r\nsovereignty, in the decisions that affect them. \r\n It is our deepest belief that solidarity between \r\npeoples and Governments is possible. In Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean, the Bolivarian Alternative for the \r\nAmericas and Petrocaribe have demonstrated this. \r\n The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has \r\nremained faithful to its founding principles. We support \r\nthe cause of the Palestinian people and their inalienable \r\nright to self-determination in an independent and \r\nsovereign State, with its capital in East Jerusalem. We \r\nsupport the cause of those other peoples whose \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity is being threatened, \r\nlike those of Venezuela and Bolivia, and we endorse \r\nthe right of Puerto Rico to be independent. \r\n We condemn the imposition of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures in violation of international law and attempts \r\nto implant a single model for a political, economic and \r\nsocial system. We object to the negative practice of \r\ncertifying countries that follows the patterns and \r\ninterests of the powerful. We strongly oppose political \r\nmanipulation and the application of double standards in \r\nthe matter of human rights, and we reject the selective \r\nimposition of politically motivated resolutions against \r\nthe member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\noffers the opportunity to open a new era in the \r\npromotion of and protection for all human rights for \r\nall, on the basis of international cooperation and \r\nconstructive dialogue. Those who caused the demise of \r\nthe old Human Rights Commission are now trying to \r\ndisqualify the Council because they have not been able \r\nto bend it to serve their own interests. They refuse to \r\nparticipate in its work in order to escape the scrutiny of \r\nthe international community within the framework of \r\n A/63/PV.7\r\n \r\n39 08-51749 \r\n \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review mechanism. The \r\nlegitimacy of the Council does not depend on the \r\nperception that the empire has about its work, but on \r\nits capacity to discharge its mandate with the strictest \r\nadherence to the principles of universality, objectivity, \r\nimpartiality and non-selectivity in the treatment of \r\nhuman rights issues. \r\n The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will \r\ncontinue to defend the interests of the Third World and \r\npromote the building of a world which is more just, \r\nmore democratic and with greater solidarity.  \r\n Cuba has had to pay a very high price for the \r\ndefence of its independence and sovereignty. The \r\nheroic Cuban people have endured the longest and \r\ncruellest blockade in history, imposed by the most \r\npowerful nation on Earth. Despite the fact that this \r\nAssembly has repeatedly and resoundingly taken a \r\nstand in favour of ending that genocidal policy, the \r\nUnited States Government has not only ignored the \r\nwill of the international community, but in marked \r\ndisregard of it has gradually intensified its economic \r\nwar against Cuba. Never has the foreign policy against \r\na country been armed with such a broad and \r\nsophisticated arsenal of aggressive measures in the \r\npolitical, economic, cultural, diplomatic, military, \r\npsychological and ideological domains. \r\n Cuba has just been lashed by two intense \r\nhurricanes, which have devastated its agriculture, \r\nseriously affected part of its infrastructure and \r\ndamaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes. \r\nAllow me to take advantage of this opportunity, on \r\nbehalf of the Cuban Government and people, to thank \r\nall those countries, organizations and persons who in \r\none way or another have honestly and sincerely \r\ncontributed with resources or moral support to the \r\nreconstruction efforts undertaken by my country. That \r\nstands in contrast with the position of the United States \r\nGovernment, which continues to ruthlessly apply the \r\nblockade. \r\n Cuba has asked for no gifts from the United \r\nStates Government. It has simply asked and asked \r\nagain that it be allowed to purchase in the United \r\nStates the materials that are indispensable for the \r\nreconstruction of homes and the power grid, and that \r\nAmerican companies be authorized to grant Cuba \r\nprivate commercial credits to buy food. The answer has \r\nbeen negative and has been accompanied by an attempt \r\nto manipulate information in such a manner that the \r\nGovernment of the United States seems to be \r\nconcerned for the well-being of the Cuban people \r\nwhile the Government of Cuba is perceived as turning \r\ndown their offer. \r\n If the United States were really so concerned for \r\nthe Cuban people, the only moral and ethical behaviour \r\nwould be to lift the blockade imposed on Cuba for five \r\ndecades, in violation of the most elemental rules of \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations. That irrational policy has a clear objective: to \r\ndestroy the process of profound revolutionary \r\ntransformation undertaken by the Cuban people since \r\n1959 — in other words, to trample on its right to self-\r\ndetermination, wrest away its freedom and its political, \r\neconomic and social conquests and push it backwards \r\nto its former neocolonial status.  \r\n The Bush Administration attempts to justify the \r\nintensification of its policy against Cuba by turning \r\nonce more to fraud and deceit, with its characteristic \r\ncynicism and hypocrisy. Its determination to dominate \r\nand recolonize Cuba is being presented as nothing less \r\nthan as an endeavour to liberate and democratize. \r\n Who, other than its accomplices, recognizes that \r\nthe United States Government has any authority in this \r\nworld in the matter of democracy and human rights? \r\nWhat authority could such a Government claim that \r\nhunts down and cruelly mistreats illegal migrants at its \r\nsouthern border, that legalizes the use of torture and \r\nkeeps in concentration camps — such as the one \r\ninstalled in the territory illegally occupied by the \r\nUnited States base at Guantánamo — people who have \r\nnot been proved of or even charged with any crime? \r\nWhat respect is due to a Government that attacks the \r\nsovereignty of other States, using the excuse of the \r\nfight against terrorism, while at the same time \r\nguaranteeing impunity to anti-Cuban terrorists? What \r\nkind of justice can be promoted by an Administration \r\nthat illegally keeps imprisoned five Cuban patriots who \r\nwere only seeking information to neutralize the actions \r\nof the terrorist groups operating against Cuba from the \r\nUnited States? \r\n Cuba appreciates the solidarity it has received \r\nfrom the General Assembly in its fight against the \r\nblockade and the aggression that it has had to confront \r\nfor almost five decades. Cuba reaffirms its unyielding \r\ndecision to defend its sovereignty and independence. \r\nCuba reiterates its will to carry on, together with \r\nmembers of the Non-Aligned Movement, in the battle \r\nA/63/PV.7  \r\n \r\n08-51749 40 \r\n \r\nfor a better world, where the rights of all peoples to \r\njustice and development are respected. \r\n To conclude, I would like to recall the words of \r\nthe Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution, \r\nComrade Fidel Castro Ruz: “A world without hunger is \r\npossible. ... A just world is possible. A new world, \r\nwhich our species eminently deserves, is possible and \r\nwill become reality.” \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the First \r\nVice-President of the Council of State and Ministers of \r\nthe heroic and supportive Republic of Cuba for the \r\nstatement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. José Ramón Machado Ventura, First Vice-\r\nPresident of the Council of State and Ministers of \r\nthe Republic of Cuba, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): Before \r\nadjourning this meeting, I wish to remind members that \r\nthe opening meeting of the High-level Event on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals will take place in the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall tomorrow from 8.45 to 10 a.m. \r\nImmediately thereafter, at 10 a.m., the general debate \r\nwill continue. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.55 p.m.  \r\n"
