(Nicaragua) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Honduras. \r\nMr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, President of the \r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. José Manuel \r\nZelaya Rosales, President of the Republic of Honduras, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Zelaya Rosales (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMr. President, allow me to extend you the warmest and \r\nmost heartfelt greeting of the people and the \r\nGovernment of Honduras. I would also extend this \r\ngreeting to all nations and peoples represented here. I \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, a distinguished representative of \r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua who today is leading the \r\nAssembly. Your prestige as a man of peace and \r\nharmony and as a builder of dreams and utopias has \r\nbeen recognized throughout the world through the \r\nnumerous prizes you have received, which honour the \r\npeoples of Central America. \r\n Honduras currently holds the presidency pro \r\ntempore of the Central American Integration System, \r\nand I would like to recognize the work of the United \r\nNations and use this opportunity also to recognize the \r\ndetermination of the Central American Presidents to \r\nbring about a process of Central American integration. \r\nAs was recognized by the European Commission, the \r\nregion of the world that is unifying the most and \r\nbecoming the most integrated is Central America — \r\nafter Europe, of course. That is part of an important \r\nprocess, because we are addressing on areas and \r\nsectors that are important for our society. \r\n Francisco Morazán was a martyr who gave his \r\nlife for the cause of Central American union and for \r\nliberal policies, opposing the enemies of independence \r\nand freedom. The peoples of Central America and of \r\nHonduras continue to fight for these causes. We \r\ncontinue to fight for unity as we seek to establish \r\neconomic independence. In recent years, Honduras has \r\nachieved a sustainable growth rate of between 6 and \r\n7 per cent, and we have been able to reduce poverty \r\nand have recognized the international and national \r\nimportance of protecting the environment. Honduras \r\nhas become a tourist destination in Central America, \r\nbecause of the beauty of its main Caribbean Bay \r\nIslands, such as Guanaja, Utila and Roatán. \r\n However, today, all of those advances in our \r\neconomy and in the fight against poverty are being put \r\nin jeopardy by the crisis and the international scale of \r\nthe financial fraud that has been brought about by the \r\nbig multinationals in the world. The serious events that \r\ntoday have dragged us into a food and energy crisis \r\nwith high fuel prices, and the collapse of the financial \r\nsystems, particularly here in the United States of \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 2 \r\n \r\nAmerica, have shown that what I and others Presidents \r\nare saying today are historic and irrefutable truths. \r\n For example, in our countries, particularly in \r\nHonduras, poverty and inequality are continuing to \r\ngrow more marked in our societies. The State continues \r\nto become weaker through privatizations and capital is \r\nconcentrated in a few firms and a few hands, lessening \r\ncapacity to produce and generate development for our \r\npeople. In recent years, the unequal distribution of \r\nwealth and income has become ever more entrenched. \r\nIn Honduras, less than 1 per cent of the population \r\npossesses 70 per cent of the national wealth. Barely \r\n10 families with links to international capital control \r\nthe main economic activities of the country, naturally \r\nimpoverishing the rest of the population. \r\n Over the last two centuries, our peoples and our \r\nregion have resisted with heroism, dignity and stoicism \r\nthe onslaught of the cruel system that governs us. Pope \r\nJohn Paul II himself came to call that capitalistic \r\nsystem savage, an immoral mercantile system that \r\nexploits men and women and turns them into mere \r\ncommodities and numbers. The merciless and demonic \r\nlaws of the invincible market only satisfy the wealth \r\nand power of the few, to the detriment of the great \r\nmajority of our societies. They believe themselves \r\ninfallible gods. They are like a sinister Proteus that \r\nplays cat and mouse with people. They act like Saturn, \r\nthe Greek god who devoured his children out of fear \r\nthat they would dethrone him. However, today, with \r\nthat logic of the law of the market, his sons are \r\ndevouring their creator in the very cradle of capitalism, \r\nin the great centre of Wall Street or the other hubs of \r\nspeculative capital in the world. \r\n To give an example, the international trafficking \r\nof drugs, arms and people are other scourges that \r\nprevent us developing peoples from achieving the \r\neconomic freedom and independence to which our \r\nnations aspire. The submission of our poor countries to \r\nthe economic choices of international capital is brutal \r\nand surprising. We can say that capitalism is devouring \r\nhuman beings in most parts of the world, and \r\nparadoxically it is now also devouring the very creators \r\nof that system. Here I shall mention two particularly \r\nsalient examples. In Honduras, over the last 20 years, \r\nmany small coffee producers have succeeded in \r\nincreasing their exports from $200 million to almost \r\n$600 million. That involved 20 years of hard work. \r\nHowever, in the last 12 months, in barely a year, with \r\nthe doubling of the prices of energy, oil, food, wheat \r\nand the main staples that we consume, we are now \r\nlosing what we achieved in that period of hard work. \r\n Another example is what has happened here to \r\nthe mandate of the United Nations. In 2000, this \r\nOrganization agreed that poverty should be reduced by \r\nat least 50 per cent in 15 years, which we know is not \r\ncoming about. The goal of reducing poverty and the \r\ncontributions that the international community pledged \r\nto the developing world are not being translated into \r\nreality. In contrast, by way of giving an example, for \r\neach dollar that the international community \r\ncontributes to cooperation, it allocates 10 dollars to the \r\narms race. \r\n Another quite fantastic example to give today is \r\nwhat is happening with the bankruptcy of the big \r\ninvestment banks. Now people are racing to provide \r\nfunds to those big banks. Logically, if we were to \r\nprovide them with what is being proposed today to \r\nsave those banking institutions that have created that \r\nspeculative capital — a sum of $700 billion — with \r\njust a third of that amount we could reduce and \r\nimmediately put an end to poverty in Africa, Asia or \r\nLatin America. That system is the true present-day \r\nKing Midas, who tried to convert everything into gold \r\nand profit for one particular sector. We shall never be \r\nfree under that system, and we know that we must not \r\naccept that condition of neo-slavery and \r\nneocolonialism through which, by its domination, it \r\nbends us to its purposes. \r\n The question for us all is can that difficult \r\nsituation being experienced today, particularly by the \r\nless developed countries, be saved. The answer is yes, \r\nwe can save ourselves from that crisis. We can respond. \r\nFirst, the State must act, the State must operate again in \r\nterms of social commitment. Capital must be used so \r\nthat it serves to build a genuinely fair society. The aim \r\nshould not be to destroy the market but simply to \r\nconstruct a social market economy. Capital should \r\nexist, but with limits. Defining the limits of capitalism \r\nis important to put an end to its primitive laws of the \r\njungle. The aim is not to eliminate entrepreneurship \r\nand the free market, but to check and regulate the \r\nabuses and to humanize and sensitize those who are in \r\nthe driving seat.  \r\n We must support a genuine democratic system, \r\nnot only in international bodies but also internally \r\nwithin our countries. We must reform false democracy, \r\nwhich uses different political means to legitimize that \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n3 08-51839 \r\n \r\nsystem of exploitation and injustice. It is a false \r\ndemocracy, in which men and women are seen merely \r\nas voters, as useful instruments employed only to \r\ndistribute power, whose consciences are manipulated \r\nby the highest bidder in a political comedy in which \r\nthose who possess wealth impose their mercantile \r\nirrationality on the larger group of those who are \r\nexcluded from and marginalized by the system. We \r\nmust reform that system, improve it and strengthen it \r\nso as to convert it into a genuine democracy. It is by \r\nthe logic of political democracies that Governments are \r\ncontrolled and States manipulated, basic services are \r\nprivatized and the whole of society is indoctrinated \r\nwith an ideology of gain, egoism and individualism. \r\n Imperialism as a system of domination of \r\ncountries and of trade must disappear from the face of \r\nthe Earth. The twenty-first century, and the peoples of \r\nthe twenty-first century, should not have to pay for the \r\nexcesses and brutality of the twentieth century.  \r\n We agree that property must exist, as it has a \r\nsocial function. Since the beginning of social \r\norganization in the world, property has always been \r\ngranted within the framework of collective ownership. \r\nThere must be the authority to intervene in speculative \r\nmarkets, as is happening now in the United States. \r\nTraders and their spokespeople do not have the right to \r\ndirect society. The strategic areas of the economy must \r\nbe at the service of the State and under its control to \r\nensure that society never finds itself without food or \r\nmedicine and that consumers are not robbed. Profits \r\nproduced by work, wealth and capital should be better \r\ndistributed in our societies among the real owners — \r\nworkers, producers, capitalists, consumers and the \r\nState — in order to attain a common good.  \r\n The major transnational companies that produce \r\nmedicines and chemical products should make \r\navailable to developing countries the patents for \r\ntechnological discoveries that can improve living \r\nconditions for our citizens. This is a time for human \r\nsolidarity.  \r\n We should end unfair competition in markets by \r\neliminating subsidies in industrialized countries and \r\nremoving tariff and non-tariff barriers. That would be a \r\ngood message of the international community, a good \r\nintention at this time of crisis, for those peoples that \r\nwere once their colonies, a message that we are no \r\nlonger looked upon as mere game reserves but as \r\nbrothers in humanity.  \r\n I am sure that the peoples of the world are able to \r\ncome together to provide alternatives to a crude system \r\nthat kills and destroys everything that does not adapt to \r\nits unmerciful laws. \r\n Developed countries have a responsibility \r\ntowards the peoples. Members know that very well. \r\nThis afternoon we want to say, from this United \r\nNations rostrum, that we are very grateful to the \r\ndeveloped world, the industrialized world, for their \r\ncooperation with us at certain times. However, our \r\npeoples and our countries do not want donations. We \r\nhave not come here to beg.  \r\n What we want is to be treated with equality and \r\nrespect, and the right to opportunities and to \r\nparticipate. We do not want to be affected by the \r\nasymmetries in the economies and differences in \r\ndeveloped countries. We do not want to have models \r\nimposed on us, models that only impoverish our \r\nnations. We do not want to be given lessons about how \r\nto manage our economies. We want to be given \r\nexamples of solidarity and responsibility in the face of \r\nthe major problems of nations, examples of how to \r\ndistinguish between matters of importance to human \r\nbeings and matters that are simply material. To \r\ndeveloped countries we say that if they offer us aid, do \r\nnot attach conditions to our acceptance of it. Do not \r\ninsist that we accept a neoliberal model that is \r\nsuffocating and exploiting our communities.  \r\n We cannot continue to measure development of \r\ncountries by the profits of large companies. We must \r\nmeasure development by the access of young people to \r\neducation and jobs, of children to food, of mothers to \r\nhospitals, of those who are ill to treatment, and of the \r\nundernourished to food. \r\n We say to the countries of the Group of Eight \r\n(G8), with all due respect, that that very important \r\norganization should expand its membership to include \r\ncountries that represent the five continents, to include \r\ncountries of the Americas, such as Mexico, Brazil, \r\nBolivia or Cuba, or, from other areas, India. The G8 \r\nshould increase its capacity for dialogue with, for \r\nexample, Central America or the South American \r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR), where there are so \r\nmany societies that could contribute with ideas, for \r\nideas are sometimes worth more than money.  \r\n The countries that cooperate should respect \r\nnational systems and not impose their own aid \r\nreception mechanisms on us. They should respect the \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 4 \r\n \r\nnational priorities and systems that each country has \r\ndeveloped in its programmes, the planning of \r\nGovernments legitimately elected by the people. \r\n Likewise, with all due respect to the European \r\ncountries and to the United States of America, we wish \r\nto ask them to consider — as a gesture of goodwill and \r\nin light of the problems that we ourselves are suffering \r\nas a result of the financial imbalances that those \r\ncountries caused — the rights of immigrants who are \r\nalready on their territories. I would also like to recall \r\nthat the peoples living in the lands of America and \r\nEurope were themselves once immigrants in those \r\nlands. \r\n What does it cost to reunite migrant families and \r\nto begin to deal with their documentation, instead of \r\ndeporting them? To immigrate is a human right, not a \r\ncrime, and we should consider it in the context of \r\nrespect for society. All of us want peace and harmony, \r\nand this is the best means of obtaining them. \r\n The world is also concerned with the enlargement \r\nof the Security Council. Like other presidents who \r\nhave spoken about this matter from this podium over \r\nthe decades, we believe that there should be \r\ndemocratization at the very top of the United Nations, \r\nand the example should begin at home. That way we \r\ncould discuss the real problems of humanity and find \r\nsolutions.  \r\n We therefore need to establish a new pedagogy, a \r\nnew way of education of our peoples, our children and \r\nfuture generations. We must cultivate, as is logical, \r\ngenuine freedom for our nations, freedom of the press, \r\nfreedom of movement, an honest freedom that gives \r\nthe people the opportunity to know the truth about their \r\nproblems without lies and manipulation. \r\n The new manner of teaching that we are \r\nproposing to the General Assembly today could be \r\npromoted through the development programmes of the \r\nUnited Nations. We must begin to teach the value of \r\nsolidarity among human beings, among countries and \r\namong the various organizations represented here. That \r\nteaching should demonstrate in a practical way that the \r\ncentre of the world is not material possessions or \r\nmoney; the centre of the world should always be the \r\nhuman being — men and women, young people, \r\nchildren, the elderly, those beings with a soul and who \r\nare made in the image of the Creator of the universe. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to take a moment to read a \r\npoem entitled, “Gold”, by the Honduran poet and \r\nwriter Alfonso Guillén Zelaya, who described well \r\nthrough poetry the events we have addressed in the \r\nAssembly.  \r\n“Gold killed in men the native communion;  \r\nIt divided the Earth and corrupted affection. \r\nBefore that, hunger did not exist. \r\nFruit grew in all places freely before this, \r\nWaters, hunting, the plains were free. \r\nAs there were no owners, there were never thieves. \r\nLife was one of peace, of love and of gentleness. \r\nPeople were good, like blessings. \r\nBut, Lord of the gifts, \r\nYour gifts are gone. \r\nWe are now condemned to live without fortune,  \r\nEverything that we have made, \r\nOur own clothing, with the gold of the stars and the \r\nsilver of the moon.” \r\n This is the Christian moral; it is the moral of the \r\nmessage today, tomorrow and forever, that we must \r\naccept the fact that this world is extremely materialistic \r\nand not very spiritual. It was the message offered when \r\na tycoon approached the Master of Galilee and asked, \r\nLord, how do I save myself? He replied: leave your \r\npossessions and follow me.  \r\n I would like to end with those thoughts on liberty, \r\nwhich is what our societies most need today. Let us \r\nensure that the liberty advocated by our forefathers — \r\nMartí, Bolívar and Morazán — transforms the destiny \r\nof globalization so that we convert it into a \r\nglobalization of solidarity, of justice and of harmony \r\namong the peoples. We must regain trust in the \r\ncollective so that we can return to trusting in reason \r\nand say to the minority that they cannot be the reason \r\nfor the State simply because of what they own. That \r\nalienating argument is unsustainable for the peoples of \r\nthe world.  \r\n I fervently appeal this afternoon for us to secure \r\nvotes for the freedom and peace of all peoples and \r\nnations of the Earth, for the principles expressed and \r\nratified today in the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly, because I firmly believe that a new world, \r\nanother world, a better world is still possible. We have \r\nunited to defend important matters of other countries. \r\nWe have united to defend the positions of President \r\nEvo Morales in Bolivia so that a real social democracy \r\ncan be established, as he has advocated. Based on those \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n5 08-51839 \r\n \r\nprinciples, we have signed the Bolivarian Alternative \r\nfor the Americas — ALBA — and, based on those \r\nprinciples, we hope that the international community \r\nwill also provide the international solidarity needed by \r\nTaiwan, which is asking for that solidarity. \r\n We ask that God’s blessing for you all and for \r\nyour families and your nations become a reality today, \r\ntomorrow and forevermore. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Honduras for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, President of the \r\nRepublic of Honduras, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President \r\nof the Republic of Mozambique \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique. \r\n Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Armando \r\nEmílio Guebuza, President of the Republic of \r\nMozambique, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Guebuza (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Mr. President, \r\nwe would like to join previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating you upon your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. We are confident that under your wise and \r\ndiligent leadership, our deliberations will be \r\nsuccessful. We take this opportunity to assure you of \r\nour full collaboration and wish you success in the \r\ndischarge of your important responsibilities. \r\n We wish to express our gratitude to your \r\npredecessor, Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, for the pragmatism and \r\ndynamism of his endeavours in conducting the work of \r\nthe sixty-second session. We also reiterate our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his engagement in the \r\nquest for peace, justice and solutions to the various \r\nchallenges faced by humanity. \r\n We have witnessed an increasing number of new \r\nand complex challenges. Among them, the food crisis \r\nis one of my country’s main concerns owing to its \r\ndirect, immediate impact on the lives of our peoples. \r\nThe origin of this crisis may be linked to factors such \r\nas climate change and the subsequent irregular rainfall \r\nthat affects agricultural productivity; desertification of \r\nvast areas and droughts around the world; increased \r\ndemand for cereals; higher oil prices and the \r\nconsequent impact on the price of transportation and \r\nother products such as agricultural raw materials; the \r\nimpact of trade liberalization and agricultural subsidies \r\nin developed countries, which have led to a gradual \r\ndecline in agricultural production in developing \r\ncountries; and finally, the distortion of cereal prices \r\nacross the globe. \r\n Once the causes of the crisis have been identified, \r\nit becomes the responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity to implement relevant and necessary \r\nsolutions in a consistent and vigorous manner. Through \r\nthat process, the crisis can be transformed into an \r\nopportunity to boost international partnerships and \r\ndevelop our countries. \r\n In that context it is important to emphasize that \r\ninternational cooperation stimulates the revival of the \r\nproductivity of farmers in developing countries, thus \r\ncontributing to a speedy transformation of their current \r\nsubsistence farming practices into commercial \r\nagriculture. Such cooperation includes improved access \r\nto improved seeds and to fertilizers and pesticides, \r\ninvestments in infrastructure for market accessibility \r\nand water management. Accordingly, we reiterate the \r\nneed to implement the pertinent recommendations set \r\nforth at the Conference of the Least Developed \r\nCountries on the rules of the World Trade Organization \r\nand the food crisis. \r\n Likewise, we call for support for regional efforts \r\nsuch as the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme in the framework of NEPAD, \r\nand the ongoing work by the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community, with a view to finding a \r\ncollective response to mitigate the impact of the food \r\ncrisis and to re-establish agriculture as the means to \r\nensure food supply and better conditions and quality of \r\nlife for the peoples of Southern Africa. \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 6 \r\n \r\n Mozambique is vulnerable to natural disasters \r\nand to the dynamics of the international prices of food \r\nand fuel products. Those factors represent a major \r\nthreat to the implementation of the Government’s \r\nsocio-economic programmes. Despite the notable \r\nprogress that we have been registering for our \r\nproduction of cassava and maize, we still import large \r\nquantities of other food products. Therefore, any cereal \r\nprice fluctuation in the world immediately affects the \r\nday-to-day lives of our people. \r\n Mozambique is endowed with natural resources \r\nwhich are favourable to mixed farming. However, the \r\nshortage of financial resources and the weak banking \r\nnetwork in the rural zones, combined with the lack of \r\ninfrastructure and technology to secure the \r\ndevelopment of commercial agriculture, have not \r\nallowed us to scale up our production to the levels that \r\ncould meet the food needs of our population. The \r\nsituation is worsened by poor distribution and \r\nmarketing systems, making it difficult to distribute and \r\nmarket the products from certain surplus zones to the \r\nneedy ones. Moreover, the cyclic natural disasters that \r\nhave struck us have resulted in losses of significant \r\nplantation areas, causing the people of those areas to \r\nlive permanently in need. Those calamities have also \r\ncaused soil erosion and depletion and as a consequence \r\nfood insecurity and malnutrition affect our people. \r\nMr. Choquehuanca Céspedes (Bolivia), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n In order to address the food crisis, our \r\nGovernment approved last June, a Food Production \r\nAction Plan for the period 2008-2011. The programme \r\nwas designed as a mechanism to implement the Green \r\nRevolution which we launched in 2007 and is goal-\r\noriented. We are aware that implementing the Action \r\nPlan together with the Green Revolution will require \r\nadditional resources, and we are therefore appealing \r\nfor such additional resources for those programmes. \r\nWe acknowledge the positive effect of the Green \r\nRevolution on the implementation of the MDGs, since \r\nno one can think about tomorrow or about education or \r\nabout gender equality or the empowerment of women if \r\nthey are hungry. \r\n In February 2008, we launched the Presidential \r\nInitiative for women and children. At that time, several \r\nmeetings were held with health professionals, religious \r\nand traditional leaders, women and youth. During those \r\nmeetings, which are being replicated at the local level, \r\nit became clear that health issues permeate the MDGs. \r\nAlthough the advances that we have recorded are \r\nsignificant, they are not sufficient to have an impact on \r\nthe reduction of avoidable deaths in Mozambique.  \r\n Our assessments show that we could, for \r\ninstance, reduce maternal mortality by more than \r\n50 per cent. We could achieve a decrease of 17 per cent \r\nin child mortality. We could significantly facilitate \r\naccess to antiretroviral treatment and to treatment for \r\ntuberculosis and malaria. We could, by 2010 have more \r\nthan 95 per cent of mothers and children sleeping \r\nunder insecticide-treated mosquito nets. However, in \r\norder to achieve those dreams, we are dependent upon \r\nan additional funding of $4 per capita a year for the \r\nhealth sector, from now until 2010. Additionally, we \r\nneed $10 million more for mosquito nets. The $590 \r\nmillion needed to fill the deficit during the next seven \r\nyears could help us train and employ around 20,000 \r\nadditional health workers. That amount would raise the \r\nnumber of doctors by 119 per cent, the number of \r\nnurses and of mothers with access to health care would \r\nrise by 68 per cent. \r\n Our dream is to prevent more avoidable deaths. \r\nAs we have indicated, we cannot realize that dream by \r\nourselves. We need the predictable, substantial and \r\nlong-term support of our partners to meet the needs \r\nthat I have just identified. We need an efficient health-\r\ncare system and coordinated support from our \r\ninternational partners, which is a noble way to ensure \r\nthe achievement of MDG 8, which focuses on \r\ndeveloping a global partnership for development. \r\n We therefore wish to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend and encourage the perseverance of the \r\ninternational solidarity movement in helping Africa, \r\nand Mozambique in particular, in the context of \r\nwomen’s and children’s health with a view to fulfilling \r\nall the commitments made at the Millennium Summit. \r\nIn numerous parts of the world, funds have been \r\nsolicited and initiatives undertaken in support of our \r\nprogrammes. That interaction with our partners has led \r\nto the building of the necessary consensus on priorities \r\nand strategies to ensure sustainable development. \r\n The world is changing and, along with all those \r\nchanges, new global challenges have arisen. The \r\nUnited Nations is a universal institution with the \r\nlegitimacy and the mandate to debate strategies and \r\nfind solutions to such major challenges. Nevertheless, \r\nstructural reforms are needed in order to improve the \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n7 08-51839 \r\n \r\nOrganization’s ability to overcome the current \r\nchallenges. In that regard, the reform process should be \r\npursued so that the United Nations can achieve greater \r\nunity and improve its ability to provide appropriate \r\nresponses to the challenges ahead, which will require \r\nus to strengthen multilateralism and promote \r\npartnerships for peace, security and development \r\nacross the world. \r\n In conclusion, we reiterate the importance of \r\ninternational cooperation to secure the production of \r\nsufficient and affordable food for all and to build a \r\nviable consensus for United Nations reform. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia. \r\n Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the Republic of \r\nEstonia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ilves: Allow me to begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann upon \r\nhis assumption of the office of President of the General \r\nAssembly. I wish him success in his responsibilities \r\nand endeavours. I also wish to express my appreciation \r\nand respect to his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for \r\nhis effective leadership during the sixty-second session \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n I shall be brief. I would like to speak today about \r\nthe following three issues: the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the prospects for \r\nrealizing them; natural disasters and humanitarian \r\nassistance; and the war between Georgia and Russia, \r\nalong with some of the conclusions that can be drawn \r\nfrom it. \r\n Let me begin with the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We must bear in mind that over half of the time \r\noriginally allotted for achieving the Goals is already \r\nbehind us. Yet, have we actually reached half our \r\ngoals? As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported \r\nhere 20 days ago, there are reasons to doubt that we \r\nhave. Some achievements can be regarded as \r\nnoteworthy progress, for example greater access to \r\neducation, a marked reduction in infant mortality, debt \r\nrelief for developing countries, an increase in access to \r\ninformation and communication technology for people \r\nin developing countries, and so on. We have also made \r\ncertain progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS. \r\n At the same time, however, progress in the \r\nspheres of trade and development cooperation has been \r\nmodest. From the Secretary-General’s report, it is clear \r\nthat, although the donor States have increased their \r\nofficial development aid, the actual flow of financial \r\nassistance in the course of the past two years has \r\nactually decreased. \r\n The European Union, of which Estonia is a \r\nmember, is on the whole, on track towards increasing \r\nits development aid to 0.7 per cent of its gross national \r\nincome, the objective agreed at the United Nations. \r\nEstonia has steadily increased its share among \r\ninternational donors; our development aid has grown \r\nfourfold since 2004. \r\n In addition to the actual decrease in development \r\naid, we suffered a serious setback when the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round of trade negotiations stalled and \r\nwhere the main theme has been a more efficient \r\nintegration of developing countries into a world trading \r\nsystem based upon equality and regulations. \r\n I would now like to set forth several positions \r\nbased upon matters of principle that Estonia regards as \r\nessential, and which are also part of the United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration. \r\n First, every nation is primarily responsible for its \r\nown development. In order to ensure their proper \r\ndevelopment, developing countries must strengthen \r\ntheir administrative infrastructure and capacity, \r\nintensify their fight against corruption and put their \r\neconomic  environment in order. That is the only way \r\nto create conditions suitable for an efficient mode of \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 8 \r\n \r\ntransferring development aid and for increasing the \r\nbenefits of the aid received. \r\n High levels of corruption, inefficient \r\nadministrative capacity and an unresponsive economic \r\nclimate make it difficult for donor-nation public \r\nopinion to support increases in development aid. In a \r\nword, our electorates — and here I am of course \r\nspeaking of democratic countries with free and fair \r\nelections — do not understand why their taxes are \r\nspent that way. \r\n Secondly, donor States and organizations can \r\nenhance the effectiveness of development cooperation \r\nby mutually coordinating and standardizing the \r\nprocedures involved in development cooperation. \r\n Finally, I would like to stress that Estonia \r\nstrongly supports British Prime Minister Gordon \r\nBrown’s and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s \r\ninitiative, the Millennium Development Goals Call to \r\nAction. The objective is to inform the general public of \r\nthe importance of fulfilling the objectives of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals programme. This year, \r\nEstonia also joined that initiative. I personally hope \r\nthat Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was right when he \r\nsaid that the MDGs are still achievable if we act now. \r\n The second Wednesday of October is the \r\nInternational Day for Natural Disaster Reduction. In \r\nthat connection, as opposed to the fight against poverty \r\nor diseases, we cannot of course set objectives for \r\nourselves that can be expressed in monetary amounts. \r\nWe can, however, formulate and implement measures \r\nthat can help to minimize the dangers and threats to \r\npeople and their property, and to avoid or reduce \r\ndestruction to physical infrastructure and the \r\nenvironment. We can thereby limit losses and alleviate \r\nthe suffering of people. That, in turn, can prevent the \r\nsocial and economic convulsions that natural \r\ncatastrophes have on repeated occasions triggered \r\nthroughout history. \r\n In the case of humanitarian catastrophes, be they \r\nnatural or man-made disasters, it is of the utmost \r\nimportance that help arrive on the scene as quickly as \r\npossible and that the access of humanitarian experts be \r\nensured, regardless of their nationality or the State or \r\norganization that they represent. Unfortunately, there \r\nhave recently been a number of occasions when \r\nvarious countries have permitted help from abroad only \r\nunder very specific conditions. As a result of such \r\npolicies, it is the weakest and the most vulnerable who \r\nsuffer the most. \r\n As I said earlier, I would like to talk about recent \r\nand ongoing events in the southern Caucasus, \r\nspecifically the military conflict between Georgia and \r\nRussia. There are a series of complex issues involved, \r\nbut here in the General Assembly I would like to raise \r\none fundamental question: What do those events mean \r\nfor us, the United Nations? \r\n To begin with, we must realize that the principles \r\ngoverning relations between States have been seriously \r\ndamaged. It is regrettable in the extreme that the basic \r\nprinciples of the United Nations as enshrined in the \r\nCharter, such as the unacceptability of threatening the \r\nuse of force or actual aggression against a nation’s \r\nterritorial integrity, were grossly and grotesquely \r\nviolated. Those principles must be and must remain the \r\nbases for the activity of the United Nations and the \r\nSecurity Council. Therefore, we have the right to \r\ndemand and ensure that the United Nations be capable \r\nof convincing one Member to withdraw its military \r\nforces from the territory of another sovereign Member \r\nState and to terminate its aggression. \r\n The capacity of the United Nations to fulfil the \r\nexpectations placed upon it cannot be dependent upon \r\nwhether said Member nation chooses or not to act \r\naccording to the good practices of international law. In \r\nthe alternative case, the United Nations loses its reason \r\nfor existence. We cannot allow international law to be \r\nfollowed selectively and only when convenient, for \r\nthen it is no longer law.  \r\n Russia’s behaviour in the weeks following the \r\ncessation of combat activity showed us that, \r\nunfortunately, even in the first decade of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, it is possible to refuse to adhere to \r\ninternational treaties, to interpret them arbitrarily and \r\nto observe international laws only when it serves one’s \r\ninterest. A permanent member of the Security Council \r\nshould be especially committed to fulfilling the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. That \r\nforces us once more to conclude that, in the interests of \r\nthe international community, it is imperative to \r\nimprove the capacity of the United Nations to regulate \r\nand resolve conflicts. Looking at recent events, it has \r\nbecome quite clear how important it is to proceed with \r\nthe reform of the Security Council.  \r\n The previous month’s events in the southern \r\nCaucasus raised another issue. Even before the armed \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n9 08-51839 \r\n \r\nconflict broke out, Georgia was the target of a \r\ncyberwar aimed at Government websites, as well as \r\nthose of news agencies and banks. In the case of \r\ncyberattacks and cyberwarfare, it is becoming ever \r\nmore difficult to determine and apprehend the \r\nperpetrators. As I stated last year from this very \r\nrostrum, cyberattacks are an international problem — \r\nindeed, a form of aggression — that no nation is able \r\nto deal with on its own. Cyberattacks can be launched \r\nagainst any nation on any continent, and from any \r\ncontinent.  \r\n Administering and policing the cyberworld to \r\navoid criminal and hostile attacks requires extensive \r\ncooperation and the standardization of relevant \r\ninternational regulations. I call upon all United Nations \r\nMember nations to deal with the risks associated with \r\ncybersecurity with the utmost seriousness. Estonia, \r\nwhich has extensive experience dealing with and \r\nrepulsing cyberattacks, is ready to contribute its \r\nexpertise to thwarting that new form of criminal \r\nwarfare. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the Republic of \r\nMalawi, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mutharika: I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session. I also take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the \r\nwise leadership he provided to the General Assembly \r\nduring the past year. \r\n I wish to start by stressing that the global food \r\ncrisis is a collective challenge to the United Nations. \r\nThroughout the world, more people are now unable to \r\nfind enough food to feed themselves. There are \r\nincreased cases of food riots that, in turn, lead to \r\npolitical instability. The food crisis has resulted from \r\nthe failure of all nations to increase and sustain the \r\nproduction of staple food crops such as wheat, rice, \r\nmaize, millet, potatoes and lentils, as well as of fish, \r\nmeat and poultry. \r\n As leaders in the United Nations, we were aware \r\nof the signs pointing towards the global food shortage, \r\nwidespread famine and malnutrition, but we decided to \r\nignore those signs. We the world leaders failed to \r\nacknowledge that the food crisis poses a new threat to \r\nthe stability of the social framework and economic \r\nprosperity of all nations, especially small ones. \r\n I submit to the Assembly that the global food \r\ncrisis is beginning to erode and even negate the gains \r\nmade in national and global economic growth and trade \r\nthat were manifested in many developed and \r\ndeveloping countries. If those negative trends are not \r\naddressed effectively, there will be growing conflict \r\nwithin and among nations as the scramble for food to \r\nfeed the people intensifies. Several factors have \r\ncontributed to the global food crisis, but I will mention \r\nonly a few. \r\n First, during the past two decades food \r\nproduction in many countries has been affected by \r\npersistent severe climate changes, such as cyclones, \r\nhurricanes, typhoons, floods, drought, rising sea levels \r\nand desertification. Those climate changes reduce \r\nproductivity in agriculture and food security. The high \r\ndependence on rain-fed agriculture, especially in \r\ndeveloping sub-Saharan countries, has also placed such \r\ncountries at the mercy of the vagaries of nature. It is a \r\nmatter of great concern that global responses to those \r\nproblems have been in the form of world conferences, \r\nseminars and workshops on climate change, but that \r\nnot much has been done by way of concrete global \r\naction. \r\n Secondly, agriculture and food production have \r\nbeen given low priority by international development \r\ninstitutions in their allocation of resources and \r\ninvestment funds. That has been compounded by low \r\nnational budgetary allocations to food production in \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 10 \r\n \r\nmany countries, especially in Africa. The recent \r\ndiversion of food crops towards the production of \r\nbiofuels has also reduced the stock of food and created \r\nfood insecurity in some countries. That is further \r\naggravated by the preference of commercial farmers to \r\ngrow cash crops rather than food crops, thereby \r\ncreating deficits in food production. \r\n Thirdly, there is general concern in Africa that \r\nmultilateral and bilateral institutions continue to \r\noppose subsidies to agriculture and food production, \r\nespecially in sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and \r\nLatin America. That has been the case despite \r\noverwhelming evidence that smallholder farmers \r\ncontinue to find enormous difficulties in accessing \r\nagricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, improved seeds, \r\ninsecticides and herbicides. Those institutions also \r\nknow that farmers are unable to produce enough food \r\nto feed themselves without subsidies. \r\n A matter of global concern is that food \r\nproduction in many developing countries has been \r\nadversely affected by environmental destruction and \r\nthe degradation of agricultural lands caused by serious \r\npollution through the deliberate dumping of toxic \r\nwaste and hazardous materials in rivers, lakes, seas and \r\nother water sources, largely by industries from the \r\nNorth. That has deprived many farmers of land to \r\nproduce more food. The dumping has spoiled coastal \r\nlands, destroyed tourism and brought misery to people \r\nwho can depend on neither agriculture nor on fish in \r\ntheir waters in order to earn a living. \r\n The problems I have enumerated pose a serious \r\nchallenge to global food security. World leaders in the \r\nUnited Nations can no longer detach themselves from \r\nthose serious issues. We should be part of the solution. \r\n First, the Government of Malawi sees the \r\nattainment of global food security as a collective \r\nchallenge. It must be premised on the ability to \r\nproduce sufficient food and to move it from surplus \r\nareas anywhere in the world to food deficit areas. In \r\norder to alleviate the global food crisis, Malawi \r\nproposes that a compact should be reached by which \r\ncountries that can produce sufficient food surpluses \r\nshould be empowered to share with others in the world, \r\nwherever they may be, through a fair international \r\ntrading system. That would ensure that all of \r\nhumankind has enough food. \r\n Secondly, Malawi proposes that the United \r\nNations urge industrialized countries to make \r\nsignificant increases in resource allocation to \r\nagriculture, especially food production. Special \r\nattention should be given to improving infrastructure, \r\nmachinery, equipment and capacity-building for \r\nfarmers, especially smallholder farmers. The private \r\nsector in industrialized countries should be persuaded \r\nto increase investment in food production, paying \r\nspecial attention to the application of science and \r\ntechnology to agriculture, and in research on climate \r\nchange and on measures to protect food-producing \r\nnations from the vagaries of climate. \r\n Thirdly, Malawi believes that the global food \r\ncrisis could be mitigated if the United Nations, the \r\nWorld Bank and other multilateral and donor agencies \r\nwere seriously to consider granting subsidies for \r\nagriculture and food production as an integral part of \r\ntheir global development policy and aid packages to \r\ndeveloping countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. \r\nIt would also be useful if the international community \r\nwere to acknowledge Africa’s potential and capacity to \r\ncontribute significantly to the solution to the global \r\nfood shortage. To that end, the United Nations should \r\nfully support the Alliance for a Green Revolution in \r\nAfrica, which is chaired by former Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan. \r\n More specifically, Malawi appeals to the Group \r\nof Eight countries to support us in creating a green belt \r\naround our lakes and along our rivers to irrigate land \r\nup to 20 kilometres from the shores. The Malawi \r\nGovernment plans to grow a lot of rice, wheat, maize, \r\nmillet, cassava, potatoes, beans and lentils for local and \r\ninternational markets. \r\n I wish to conclude by stating that Malawi is \r\nconvinced that, in order to achieve global food \r\nsecurity, the United Nations must persuade the rich \r\nindustrialized countries to share research, science and \r\ntechnology in food production and processing with the \r\npoor countries. Furthermore, the industrialized \r\ncountries should consider funding food research \r\nprogrammes and subsidizing agriculture in developing \r\ncountries as part of attaining global food security. \r\n The global food crisis is not beyond the capacity \r\nof the community of nations to resolve. The global \r\npolicy to create a hunger-free world must be adopted \r\nhere in the General Assembly. All nations big and \r\nsmall, rich and poor, must work together to eliminate \r\nthe global food shortages, famines, hunger and \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n11 08-51839 \r\n \r\nmalnutrition. Together we can do it. God bless the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Dimitris Christofias, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus. \r\n Mr. Dimitris Christofias, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Dimitris Christofias, President of the Republic of \r\nCyprus, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Christofias: I wish first to extend \r\nsincere congratulations to Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session and to express my appreciation for \r\nthe work done by his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim. I \r\nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport (A/63/1) on the work of the Organization, and I \r\nwelcome his comprehensive approach to threats and his \r\nfocus on recently emerged challenges. \r\n It is an honour for me to address the General \r\nAssembly for the first time as President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus. Maintaining the effectiveness of multilateral \r\ndiplomacy and strengthening the relevance of the \r\nUnited Nations has been one of the cornerstones of the \r\nforeign policy of the Republic of Cyprus since it won \r\nits independence in 1960. \r\n The United Nations is important to the \r\ninternational community and particularly important to \r\nCyprus. It is an essential institution for our global \r\nsurvival and for the further development of humankind \r\nin a balanced and fair way in increasingly difficult \r\nconditions. Our peoples look to the United Nations as \r\nthe best forum for addressing such global problems as \r\npoverty, climate change, rising energy and food prices, \r\ndiseases, natural disasters, human rights abuses and \r\nmany other pressing global problems. Either we do \r\nthings together in a collective, coordinated way or the \r\nproblems will persist and become even less \r\nmanageable. \r\n This week, two important issues are being given \r\nparticular attention — the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the special needs \r\nof Africa. I applaud the focus being given to both, \r\nhighlighting the imperative need for collective action \r\nby the international community. However, we must \r\nmatch our words with deeds. \r\n Cyprus emerged from colonialism as an \r\nimpoverished independent State in 1960. Despite the \r\nfact that Cyprus has suffered greatly, we have managed \r\nto improve our economy. Today, Cyprus is firmly \r\ncommitted to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and maintains an emphasis on \r\nAfrica in its overseas development assistance projects. \r\nOur approach is to focus on a small number of \r\ncountries, concentrating our efforts on infrastructural \r\ndevelopment in the health and education sectors. \r\nCyprus is gradually intensifying its efforts by \r\nincreasing the level of assistance to additional \r\ncountries. \r\n Small States have higher stakes in multilateral \r\ndiplomacy and in a fair and functional system of \r\ncollective security, based on the principles of sovereign \r\nequality and respect for territorial integrity. \r\n There is no clearer example of that than Cyprus \r\nitself. From the earliest days of its independence, \r\nCyprus was forced to appeal to the world community \r\nfor support in defending and preserving its \r\nindependence, its sovereignty and its territorial \r\nintegrity. It became a victim of foreign interference, \r\nwhich sowed the seeds of domestic problems for the \r\nnew State. Those difficulties were exploited in the \r\nservice of strategic interests alien to our independence \r\nand our territorial integrity. The culmination was the \r\nmilitary coup instigated by the military junta of Athens \r\nand the Turkish military invasion of July and August \r\n1974.  \r\n However, Cyprus survived. The will of the \r\ninternational community for Cyprus to survive is found \r\nin the plethora of Security Council and General \r\nAssembly resolutions — most of them, regrettably, not \r\nimplemented. However, the moral support and resolute \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 12 \r\n \r\nstance provided Cyprus with a sword and shield that \r\nhave ensured that it has remained and will continue to \r\nremain an undivided independent country with a single \r\nsovereignty, single citizenship and single international \r\npersonality. \r\n In addition, the resolutions of the United Nations \r\non Cyprus contain two other important elements. They \r\nprovide for a process of negotiations in the form of a \r\ngood offices mission of the Secretary-General and, \r\nvery importantly, they define the legal and political \r\nframework on which the discussions for the federal \r\narchitecture of the Cypriot State will be built. Both of \r\nthose elements are crucial. I firmly believe that our \r\nsuccess in the new effort that is now beginning will \r\ndepend upon respecting those essential conditions. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n With regard to the process of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s good offices mission, it entails negotiations \r\nwith the Cypriots themselves in which they are the \r\nprincipal players. They are the owners of the process. \r\nThe Cypriots themselves must build the State they \r\nenvision for their society. The role of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and of the international community is to assist \r\nand to support. We are grateful for that. Good offices \r\nare not arbitration; they are not mediation. Recent \r\nexperience has shown that any attempt to impose — \r\nand even to import — non-Cypriot-inspired and \r\nimprovised models will meet with rejection by the \r\nCypriot people. \r\n The relevant Security Council resolutions are also \r\nimportant for the new effort because they provide the \r\nlegal political framework within which the effort must \r\ntake place. That framework prescribes a bizonal and \r\nbicommunal federation with a single international \r\npersonality, single indivisible sovereignty and single \r\ncitizenship. The federal institutions will embody the \r\nprinciple of political equality as defined by the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, in terms not of numerical \r\nequality but of effective participation by the Greek \r\nCypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities in all organs \r\nof the federal State. \r\n It is important to remind ourselves that a bizonal \r\nand bicommunal federation has been the only mutually \r\nagreed basis since 1977. It was reaffirmed as recently \r\nas a few weeks ago. It represents a compromise, and \r\nindeed the only possible compromise, on which a \r\npolitical arrangement can be built. The relevant \r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the \r\nConstitution of Cyprus exclude partition, secession or \r\nunion with any other country. \r\n The kind of solution we agree to must take into \r\naccount not only our history and international legality, \r\nbut also the kind of society we are and the kind of \r\nsociety we want to bequeath to our children. In that \r\nsociety, all Cypriot children must be born free and \r\nequal. Human rights and the fair satisfaction of human \r\nneeds must take precedence over strategic \r\nconsiderations dictated by political expedience. \r\n A new intensive effort started on 3 September \r\nwith the aim of overcoming the impasses of the past \r\nand achieving progress that will lead to the \r\nreunification of Cyprus under mutually agreed terms \r\nand the withdrawal of foreign troops after 34 years of \r\ndivision and foreign occupation. If that effort is to \r\nsucceed, there is a need for political will on the part of \r\nCypriots, as well as the positive engagement of other \r\nimportant players, which for historical reasons have \r\nbeen part of the problem and need to become part of \r\nthe solution. \r\n For my part, I want to assure the General \r\nAssembly from this rostrum that my political will to do \r\nwhat is necessary to solve the problem is firm and \r\ndeep-rooted. My origins are in the Progressive Party of \r\nWorking People of Cyprus and in the popular \r\nmovement of the island, which prides itself on a long \r\nhistory of struggles, and indeed sacrifices, in defence \r\nof friendship, cooperation and peaceful coexistence \r\nbetween Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. On the \r\nother hand, I am one of those Cypriots who was deeply \r\nand directly affected by the foreign military invasion of \r\n1974, because I myself and my family are internally \r\ndisplaced persons — refugees in our own country. The \r\nrole of Cypriots is to agree on what they want. We \r\nmust try to achieve that with the leader of the Turkish \r\nCypriot community, Mehmet Ali Talat. I believe that \r\nwe can achieve it. \r\n But that is not enough to achieve a solution. \r\nTurkey should contribute to the process in a positive \r\nway. Turkey still maintains over 40,000 troops and tens \r\nof thousands of settlers in Cyprus and can, without a \r\ndoubt, determine the outcome of the issues under \r\ndiscussion. We believe that the solution should benefit \r\neverybody and will benefit everybody. It would allow \r\nCypriots — Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots \r\nalike — to live together and work together in an \r\nindependent, prosperous country within the family of \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n13 08-51839 \r\n \r\nthe European Union, without the presence of foreign \r\narmies and illegal colonists and under conditions of \r\nsecurity and respect for their identity and their rights. \r\n Our world faces many problems, which are \r\nbecoming increasingly complex. It is our conviction \r\nthat those problems can be solved and that new threats \r\ncan be prevented only through effective multilateral \r\ncollective action. Peace must prevail — a true peace \r\nbased on respect for international law and not the right \r\nof might. A response to the problem of international \r\nterrorism will be effective only if our world becomes \r\nless unjust. If hunger and poverty are not tackled, if \r\nregional disputes are not resolved on the basis of \r\ninternational legitimacy, and if global wealth is not \r\ndistributed more fairly, peace cannot grow strong roots. \r\n The United Nations is an achievement of our \r\nfathers and a necessary tool for ensuring a more stable, \r\nfair and prosperous world. Ultimately, the United \r\nNations is only as successful as we, the Member States, \r\nallow it to be. I wish our community of nations a \r\nsuccessful sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Dimitris Christofias, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Colombia \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Colombia. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Álvaro Uribe \r\nVélez, President of the Republic of Colombia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Uribe Vélez (spoke in Spanish): \r\nSpeaking once again before the General Assembly, I \r\nwould like to congratulate you on your election, \r\nMr. President, and to wish you every success. \r\n Colombia continues to fight so that each and \r\nevery citizen can trust that he or she will live, work, \r\nundertake projects, study and be happy in his or her \r\nhomeland. That trust is sustained by democratic \r\nsecurity, security for socially responsible investment \r\nand the construction of social cohesion. \r\n Crimes against the safety of citizens continue to \r\ndecrease, but we are not satisfied. So far this year, the \r\nnumber of crimes has fallen by 30 per cent in \r\ncomparison to the same period last year. We have \r\nprioritized the protection of union leaders, teachers and \r\njournalists. Of the 11,204 homicides committed as of \r\n10 September, 36 were of workers and teachers \r\naffiliated with trade unions or independent teachers. To \r\ndate, not a single journalist has been murdered. The \r\nGovernment grants individual protection to 8,612 \r\ncitizens, 1,462 of whom belong to trade unions. \r\n Our determination to combat impunity is \r\nongoing. Between 1991 and 2001, only two \r\nconvictions were handed down. Thanks to efforts in \r\nrecent years in terms of budgeting, the strengthening of \r\nthe judicial system, the security policy and the \r\ntripartite agreement among workers, business leaders \r\nand the Government, sponsored by the International \r\nLabour Organization, 199 persons have been convicted \r\nfor the murder of workers and 134 of them are in \r\nprison. Of the 123 sentences handed down, 85 have \r\noccurred in the past three years. \r\n In the past, terrorist organizations penetrated the \r\nlabour movement, resulting in the murder of workers. \r\nThe dismantling of the paramilitaries has eliminated \r\nthat source of suffering, but terrorist guerrillas persist \r\nin committing such crimes, as recently happened in the \r\nsouth of the country with the murder of a group of \r\nteachers by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de \r\nColombia-Ejército del Pueblo (FARC). \r\n Recently, our tranquillity in the absence of \r\nterrorist attacks was shattered by a car bomb set off by \r\nFARC, which destroyed the palace of justice in the city \r\nof Cali and left several people dead and others injured, \r\nas well as many poor families with their small \r\nbusinesses and homes destroyed. \r\n Of the approximately 60,000 terrorists that \r\nravaged the country at the start of the Government’s \r\nterm of office, 48,000 have abandoned their criminal \r\norganizations and joined the reintegration programme, \r\nwhich is a great challenge for Colombia. As of \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 14 \r\n \r\n17 September this year, 2,436 guerrilla members —\r\n2,147 of them from FARC — had been demobilized. \r\n In a democracy of opinion such as ours, the \r\nsustainability of democratic security depends on its \r\ncredibility, which in turn is based on effectiveness and \r\ntransparency. That transparency is tantamount to the \r\nobservance of the fundamental human rights we all \r\nenjoy. From that foundation comes our respect for \r\nliberties in the midst of the fight against terrorism and \r\nfor openness, vigilance, criticism and debate at the \r\nnational and international levels. \r\n Furthermore, a formative, world-leading effort in \r\nhuman rights within our armed forces is crucial, as is \r\nthe ongoing adjustment of operative protocols through \r\nsuch measures as that requiring soldiers to wait for the \r\npresence of a judicial delegate before moving the body \r\nof a member of a criminal organization killed in action. \r\nWe are also resolved to investigate and assist in the \r\ninvestigation of any type of accusation and the \r\nmodernization of military criminal legislation. \r\n On 10 December, our country will voluntarily \r\nsubmit our human rights record to the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review, a new mechanism created by the \r\nUnited Nations that is an additional contribution to the \r\npublic discussion of our new road map on the matter. \r\nOur work with the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights and with the Organization of \r\nAmerican States on the policy of truth, justice and \r\nredress for victims must, along with our historic \r\nmemory, heal wounds and help to extinguish the flames \r\nof violence forever. \r\n There are intangible results of democratic \r\nsecurity. Citizens have greater faith in the State and \r\nturn to it for protection, overcoming the past \r\nindifference of some and the inclination of many to \r\nsolve problems by their own means. Additionally, we \r\nhave recovered the State monopoly on weapons and on \r\nofficial justice. Citizens have lost their fear of \r\ndenouncing others, testifying and cooperating with the \r\narmed forces and the justice system. Victims are no \r\nlonger fearful and today are coming forward to claim \r\ntheir rights. \r\n One year ago, I looked out at this Assembly in the \r\nfrustration of not having been able to rescue Ingrid \r\nBetancourt and those held in captivity with her. Today, \r\nthanks to the heroism, planning and bloodless \r\neffectiveness of our soldiers, Ingrid Betancourt is a \r\nsymbol of freedom — the freedom to which we aspire \r\nas we liberate those who remain in captivity and put an \r\nend to such shameful crimes in our homeland. \r\n Social cohesion validates security. Meeting the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) set for 2015 \r\nis an urgent need for us as an essential part of building \r\nsocial cohesion. We are close to reaching the goal of no \r\nmore than 3 per cent of children under the age of five \r\nbeing malnourished. We are determined to reach zero \r\nand are now beginning to provide early schooling to \r\nthose children. \r\n By 2010, we hope to have reached 100 per cent in \r\nbasic education coverage. Towards the goal of \r\naveraging 10.6 years of education for the population \r\nbetween ages 15 and 24, we have already achieved an \r\naverage of more than nine years. The number of \r\nstudents having to repeat a grade has decreased from \r\n6.1 per cent to 3.3 per cent, towards a goal of  \r\n2.3 per cent. \r\n Mortality rates for children under five years of \r\nage have fallen from 37 to 20 per 1,000 births, with a \r\ngoal of 17. That same indicator for children younger \r\nthan one year has decreased from 31 to 15.6, with a \r\ngoal of 14. Vaccination coverage is almost at \r\n95 per cent, the percentage defined in the MDGs for \r\n2015. Our great challenge is to reduce the pronounced \r\ndisparities between regions. \r\n Despite the economy’s problems, we are still \r\nfully determined to meet the social goals through such \r\nprogrammes as Families in Action, Bank of \r\nOpportunities and the Together Network, which \r\nfocuses social tools on the poorest spheres. That is all \r\nsupported by very ambitious goals in the areas of child \r\nnutrition, educational quality and coverage, vocational \r\ntraining, health insurance, connectivity and good \r\nmanagement of social resources. With regard to the \r\nlatter, our administrative reform, which has already \r\nbeen extended to 411 State entities, seeks to prevent \r\nthe State from being discredited, eliminating \r\nbureaucratic wastefulness and achieving social \r\nefficiency. \r\n The mortgage and financial crises are minor \r\nproblems compared to the threats to the environment. \r\nAlthough Colombia produces 0.35 per cent of world \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions, we are highly vulnerable to \r\nthe ravages of climate change resulting from melting \r\nice and floods. More than 51 per cent of our territory is \r\npreserved as rainforest and is a major net contributor of \r\noxygen. \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n15 08-51839 \r\n \r\n Some of our most important environmental \r\nprogrammes include the building of mass \r\ntransportation systems in nine cities, with plans under \r\nway for 10 more; a network of 66,000 rural families \r\nworking as forest rangers, who are paid by the State to \r\nmaintain collective areas free from illicit crops and to \r\nsupervise the recovery and conservation of forests \r\nunder the oversight of the United Nations; the \r\nconservation of 257 protected natural areas; the \r\nimplementation of aqueduct and basic sanitation \r\nprojects in the country’s 32 departments and the 1,102 \r\nmunicipalities; and the promotion of alternative energy \r\nsources such as wind power and biofuels. \r\n There are three common objections to biofuels: \r\nthe risk of destroying the rainforest, the elimination of \r\nareas for agricultural food production, and the small \r\namount of energy generated compared to that used to \r\nproduce it. Colombia has 578,000 square kilometres of \r\nrainforest and 43 million hectares of savannah. We will \r\nnot allow the rainforest to be touched. Protecting it is \r\nour main contribution to combating global warming. \r\nWith the available savannah, we can expand our \r\nagricultural production concentrated in 5 million \r\nhectares, increase the number of livestock to 24 million \r\nheads of cattle and, without affecting food production, \r\ndevelop a large biofuel industry that generates good \r\nquality jobs, increases income and becomes an \r\nalternative to coca, which fuels terrorism. Our \r\nproductivity is high, thanks to sources of energy such \r\nas sugar cane and the African oil palm, which also \r\nprotects the soil from direct sunlight and prevents \r\nerosion. For every energy unit used, 8 energy units of \r\nethanol are produced, or 6.5 units in biodiesel. \r\n Illicit drugs are a great enemy of the \r\nenvironment, and they fuel terrorism. Colombia still \r\nsuffers from violence because of illicit drugs. We speak \r\nof shared responsibility not to assign exclusive \r\nresponsibilities to consumer countries, for, unfortunately, \r\nour young people also use drugs. We speak of shared \r\nresponsibility to spur the world to combat production, \r\ntrafficking, consumption, asset laundering and \r\nchemical precursors on an equal basis. Our \r\nGovernment requests that consumption be punished in \r\nour country and across the international community. \r\nWe have extradited more than 800 persons. This year, \r\nwe must spray 130,000 hectares of coca crops, while \r\nanother 100,000 must be manually eradicated. Over the \r\npast five years, 10,000 properties have been \r\nconfiscated. However, there has been no significant \r\nreduction in illicit crop areas and consumption is on \r\nthe rise.  \r\n Let us consider that situation. It is more difficult \r\nto carry out prevention and rehabilitation efforts \r\nagainst the backdrop of exponential growth in \r\nconsumption resulting from a permissive attitude. The \r\ndestruction of the rainforest to plant coca, the erosion \r\nof the soil and the pollution caused by chemical \r\nprecursors are enormous affronts on the environmental \r\nbalance. Whoever buys a personal dose of illicit drugs \r\nencourages a child to become a distributor and, later, a \r\nfeared criminal. Whoever buys a personal dose of illicit \r\ndrugs helps to set off a car bomb in Colombia and to \r\ndestroy four trees from our Amazon rainforest. \r\n Investors from all over the world are coming to \r\nColombia every day. Twice as many tourists, from \r\nevery corner of the world, are visiting our country as \r\nwere five years ago. Many of those who looked on our \r\ncountry with scepticism and spoke about Colombia as a \r\nfailed State can now discern clear signals of \r\ninstitutional strength and democratic boldness. \r\nColombia today generates more trust and respect, but \r\nthe work goes on. To free us all from the horrors of \r\ndrug trafficking, terrorism and poverty, we need more \r\nresolute support from the international community. I \r\nwould very much like to thank the United Nations for \r\nits very significant presence in our country. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n Mr. Choquehuanca Céspedes (Bolivia), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Latvia. \r\n Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 16 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency  \r\nMr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of Latvia, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Zatlers: I wish to begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on assuming \r\nthe post of President of the General Assembly at its \r\ncurrent session. \r\n Today I shall start by addressing the security \r\nsituation in the world. During the past year, the \r\ninternational community has deepened its \r\nunderstanding of frozen conflicts. Frozen does not \r\nmean resolved; it means that those conflicts are able to \r\nre-emerge. Therefore, I am particularly glad that \r\nsignificant progress has been achieved towards \r\nresolving long-lasting conflicts in some regions. \r\n First, I would like to mention Kosovo. Strong \r\ninvolvement by the United Nations, the European \r\nUnion (EU) and the United States helped to resolve a \r\nprotracted conflict in the Balkans. Now we need to \r\nfocus our efforts on the development of Kosovo’s \r\nstatehood: political stability, economic prosperity, \r\nsecurity and good relations with its neighbours. \r\n I welcome the decision of the Secretary-General \r\nto reconfigure the United Nations Interim \r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo. It is necessary to \r\ncontinue the constructive cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the EU so that the Kosovo Mission \r\ncan be fully deployed. That is important both for \r\nKosovo and for the entire West Balkans region. \r\n The international community has also made \r\nremarkable efforts to assist Afghanistan in building a \r\ndemocratic, prosperous and secure State. Large and \r\nsmall countries and civilian and military organizations \r\nfrom all over the world are working together to fulfil \r\nour common aspiration to peace and stability. \r\n We must not undermine that immense effort by \r\nbeing impatient. The war ravaged Afghanistan for  \r\n20 years; it will take at least as much time to rebuild a \r\npeaceful society. The international community must \r\npush ahead until that long-term aim is achieved. \r\n Latvia is increasing its commitment to the Afghan \r\npeople in terms of development and security \r\nassistance. We are focusing our civil engagement on \r\nensuring good governance and a strong judiciary and \r\non meeting the basic needs of the Afghan people. \r\n The prospects for peace and stability in the \r\nMiddle East affect the whole world. Latvia hopes that \r\nthe peace negotiations between the Government of \r\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority will produce \r\nresults. We hope that the parties will use the window of \r\nopportunity to conclude a peace agreement by the end \r\nof 2008. The indirect talks that have resumed between \r\nIsrael and Syria are another positive signal.  \r\n Latvia welcomes the stabilization process in \r\nLebanon. We hope that the Doha agreement will be \r\nfully implemented and that it will serve as a solid \r\nfoundation for renewed political stability, national \r\nunity and sustainable economic development in the \r\ncountry. \r\n Not all of the developments over the past year \r\nhave been positive. We have witnessed new challenges \r\nto the law-based international system. We should ask \r\nourselves whether we, as the international community, \r\ncan accept the fact that peacekeeping troops protect \r\nonly one side involved in a conflict. Can we accept the \r\nfact that peacekeeping forces are occupying territories \r\nthat are clearly outside the conflict zones? Can we \r\naccept the fact that the protection of nationals abroad is \r\nbeing used as a pretext for a large-scale use of force in \r\nanother State without the approval of the Security \r\nCouncil? \r\n All those questions arise from the international \r\nresponse to the recent war in Georgia. If they matter to \r\nus, we should have a clear plan to resolve the Georgian \r\ncrisis. The most important task is adherence to and \r\nimplementation of the six-point ceasefire agreement on \r\nthe part of the Russian Federation. First, foreign troops \r\nmust be removed from all Georgian soil. Equally \r\nimportant is the establishment of an EU monitoring \r\nmission to normalize the situation in Georgia. \r\n For 15 years now, the United Nations has \r\nmandated the United Nations Observer Mission in \r\nGeorgia. We must ensure that there are no obstacles to \r\nthe continuation of that effort. I call upon world leaders \r\nto come together not only to provide humanitarian aid \r\nto Georgia, but also to ensure a massive international \r\neffort to help rebuild the country’s economy and \r\ninfrastructure.  \r\n It is about time that we seriously examine our \r\ndevelopment commitments. The time between now and \r\n2015 may seem long, but it is less than the time that \r\nhas elapsed since the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in 2000. Two days ago, I \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n17 08-51839 \r\n \r\nparticipated in the high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs, and tomorrow I will participate in \r\nthe high-level event on the MDGs. Those are important \r\nefforts aimed at giving the issue the top priority that it \r\ndeserves. We must significantly accelerate the \r\nprocesses for achieving the MDGs by 2015. A clearer \r\npicture of what we must achieve in the interim in each \r\nof the main clusters of the MDGs — health, education, \r\ngrowth and climate change — is what the United \r\nNations needs immediately. \r\n We also need a clearer picture of the required \r\ndivision of labour among various actors, and we need \r\nto develop a shared sense of progress. A clear plan of \r\naction is what we need right now. Therefore, Latvia \r\nstrongly supports the EU Call for Action initiative on \r\nthe MDGs. Climate change will have a major negative \r\nbearing on the achievement of the MDGs. Latvia \r\nsupports broader use of renewable energy resources to \r\nreduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, \r\nclimate change cannot be seen as an exclusively \r\nenvironmental challenge; we need a more integrated \r\napproach. \r\n Changes to energy consumption patterns must be \r\ntaken into account as we move towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment, food security and worldwide trade. \r\nInnovative technologies, as well as sustainable \r\nproduction and consumption, would deliver both \r\nmidterm and long-term results. Carbon dioxide \r\nemissions cannot be cut in some regions while others \r\ndo nothing. While each of our countries must commit \r\nto cutting emissions, success will be possible only if \r\nthere is a truly global agreement that enables us to do \r\nso and tells us how. The United Nations, as the only \r\ntruly global Organization, must play a decisive role. \r\n Trade liberalization is an important contributor to \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs. Although the recent \r\ntrade liberalization efforts at the World Trade \r\nOrganization were not successful, the process must be \r\ncontinued at the multilateral level. \r\n Globalization has brought with it both increased \r\nprosperity and increased risks. We need to find a way \r\nto ensure that tomorrow’s globalization will offer \r\ngrowing prosperity to all people. Globalization will \r\nproduce benefits on a truly global scale only if trade is \r\nliberalized across the board. Every country and every \r\nregion must do its fair share in that process. \r\n I would like to congratulate Ms. Navanethem \r\nPillay, the new United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, on the assumption of her duties and to \r\nwish her every success in that highly important post. I \r\nwould also like to thank Ms. Louise Arbour for her \r\ninvaluable contribution to the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights. \r\n This year, symbolically, the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights coincides with the ninetieth anniversary of the \r\nfounding of the Republic of Latvia. In 1918, the Act of \r\nProclamation of the Republic of Latvia declared:  \r\n “All citizens, irrespective of their ethnicity, are \r\nasked to help, for the rights of all people will be \r\nguaranteed in Latvia. It will be a democratic and \r\njust State where oppression and injustice do not \r\nexist”.  \r\nI am truly proud of that statement. Thirty years before \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, the Republic of Latvia declared its adherence to \r\nthe same core values and principles and fully \r\nimplemented them in the newly established State. \r\n Unfortunately, by the time the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights had been adopted, Latvia \r\nhad come under foreign occupation and its people had \r\nbeen deprived of their right to freely determine their \r\npolitical status and were being subjected to oppression \r\nand injustice. It was only in 1991 that Latvia restored \r\nits statehood and the continuity of its commitment to \r\nfundamental human rights, inherent human dignity, \r\nequality and the universality of those values. \r\n The creation of the Human Rights Council and \r\nthe beginning of the Universal Periodic Review are \r\nimportant steps aimed at promoting the values of the \r\nUniversal Declaration. The special procedures of the \r\nHuman Rights Council play a particular role in that \r\nregard. Latvia expresses its full support for them and \r\nurges all United Nations Members to cooperate fully \r\nwith the special procedures, including by issuing \r\nstanding invitations to them. \r\n Latvia is ready to share with the international \r\ncommunity its experience in the area of promoting \r\nhuman rights. Latvia has put forward its candidacy for \r\nthe Human Rights Council for the year 2014. \r\n This year marks the tenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Rome Statute establishing the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). We welcome the \r\nprogress the Court has achieved in its analyses, \r\ninvestigations and judicial proceedings. We call upon \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 18 \r\n \r\nall States to ensure full cooperation with the Court. The \r\nICC is not an instrument that can be activated or \r\ndeactivated according to political expediency. We are \r\nconvinced that universality of justice is a prerequisite \r\nfor sustainable peace. \r\n Effective multilateralism requires combining \r\ngreater awareness of the nature of the risks we face \r\nwith a contemporary understanding of how \r\ninternational politics are forged today. International \r\norganizations are only one part of our global system, \r\nand often that part is the most resistant to change. It is \r\nregrettable that the enthusiasm and momentum \r\ngenerated during the 2005 World Summit in reforming \r\nthis universal international body has somewhat faded. \r\n Reform of the Security Council is long overdue. \r\nWe must move on from the discussion of procedure \r\ninto a discussion of substance. We welcome the recent \r\ndecision by the General Assembly to continue \r\nimmediately within the Open-ended Working Group on \r\nthe Question of Equitable Representation on and \r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council \r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council to \r\nprepare intergovernmental negotiations on the question \r\nof the Security Council’s expansion.  \r\n While recognizing the need for structural reform \r\nof the United Nations, we should not lose sight of \r\nmaking more effective use of existing capacity. \r\nManagement reform is central to all those efforts. We \r\nsupport further measures aimed at ensuring greater \r\ntransparency, enhanced accountability and strict budget \r\ndiscipline. There has been some progress, but not \r\nenough by far. \r\n We live in a world with deteriorating security, a \r\ngrowing population, the consequences of climate \r\nchange and market turbulence aggravated by high \r\nenergy and food prices. We need deeper engagement \r\nwith the risks we face globally. That requires a new \r\ncommitment to our values and a willingness to work \r\nfor an international system that has a vision of the \r\nfuture at its heart. I would like that to become the \r\ndriving force for all the work of the General Assembly \r\nat this sixty-third session. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Latvia for his \r\nstatement. \r\n Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of Latvia, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\nAddress by Mr. Marcus Stephen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru. \r\n Mr. Marcus Stephen, President of the Republic of \r\nNauru, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency  \r\nMr. Marcus Stephen, President of the Republic of \r\nNauru, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Stephen: I offer my congratulations to \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. I can assure him that Nauru will lend its full \r\ncooperation to him as he leads our work during this \r\ntime. Also, allow me to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan \r\nKerim, for his leadership of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session. \r\n I wish to reaffirm Nauru’s commitment and \r\nabiding faith in the ideals and objectives of the United \r\nNations. We declare our support for the Organization’s \r\nefforts to resolve the multiple humanitarian, peace and \r\nsecurity and development challenges confronting our \r\nworld today. \r\n I am grateful for this opportunity to address the \r\nAssembly for the first time as President of the Republic \r\nof Nauru. I took the challenge of the office fully \r\ncognizant of my responsibilities to the people of \r\nNauru. Despite knowing that the road to our economic \r\nrecovery will be slow and painful, I have committed \r\nmy Administration to carrying out its duties based on \r\nthe fundamental principles of democracy, good \r\ngovernance and sound socio-economic policies. \r\n At the beginning of this decade, Nauru was at the \r\nbrink of total economic collapse. Much has been \r\nachieved to improve our economy and to address the \r\nresulting social problems. That has been accomplished \r\nby implementing a range of fiscal, economic and \r\ngovernance reforms. I am happy to say that Nauru \r\ntoday has stabilized. We are now at the beginning of a \r\nrebuilding phase in our history. However, I say this \r\nwith a degree of caution and regard for the fragility of \r\nour situation. \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n19 08-51839 \r\n \r\n In order to secure Nauru’s recovery and to ensure \r\nrebuilding and development, we will need ongoing \r\nassistance from our development partners. We need \r\ncoordinated assistance targeted at our priorities and in \r\nline with our strategies so that we may fulfil our \r\npromise for a better quality of life for my people.  \r\n Nauru appreciates the financial and material \r\nassistance from our development partners, in particular \r\nAustralia, Taiwan, Japan, New Zealand and the \r\nEuropean Union. We appeal for such cooperation to be \r\ncontinued in order to strengthen our nation-building \r\nefforts. \r\n Since assuming office, I have been determined \r\nthat Nauru learn from, and not repeat, the mistakes of \r\nthe past. As a consequence of mismanagement and \r\ncorruption, past Administrations took Nauru from what \r\nthen seemed to be a bright future to standing on the \r\nbrink of collapse. In that process, national reserves and \r\nassets were all lost, and we have been left with an \r\nunmanageable burden of domestic and external debt. \r\nNauru will only ever be able to service a very small \r\nportion of that debt if we are to ensure ongoing \r\nrecovery and sustained development. We therefore seek \r\nthe understanding and consideration of those countries \r\nand institutions to which we owe money and appeal to \r\nthem to allow debt forgiveness or major write-downs. \r\nAt the same time, we are implementing financial, \r\nlegislative and constitutional measures to ensure that \r\nthis never happens again. \r\n Our limited human resources capacity, relative to \r\nthe enormity of the tasks yet to be accomplished, is a \r\nfurther impediment to our development goals. \r\nImproving the quality of education in our schools, \r\npromoting trade and skills training, certifying existing \r\nskills and encouraging ongoing professional and job-\r\nrelated development are therefore high priorities for \r\nmy Government. Increasing our human resources \r\ncapacity will not only serve to address the risk to \r\nsustaining our development, but will increase job \r\nopportunities for my people, domestically and abroad. \r\nWith unemployment overall estimated above 30 per \r\ncent, and worse among our youth, labour migration and \r\nthe associated remittances must be seen as part of the \r\nrange of measures to secure Nauru’s recovery and \r\nfuture. \r\n I appeal to all developed countries with major \r\nworkforce requirements to open up their job \r\nopportunities, reduce barriers to trade in services and \r\npromote labour mobility. That can contribute far more \r\nto the development of small States than many other \r\ntraditional forms of aid. Moreover, such measures can \r\nbe targeted at specific sectors and activities, for fixed \r\ntime periods and with certain conditions. The New \r\nZealand and Australian unskilled labour schemes for \r\nPacific workers are two prime examples. The United \r\nStates military expansion in Guam provides another \r\nopportunity for significant development assistance to \r\nthe Pacific. We call on the United States for \r\npreferential access to those opportunities. That will \r\nrequire special trade, labour and immigration \r\nconditions. \r\n We need to build our human resources capacity to \r\nshift Nauru away from its historical reliance on \r\ngovernment and public sector employment. Likewise, \r\nwe must develop the private sector in Nauru. We \r\nencourage foreign direct investment, and we welcome \r\nassistance in developing diversity and new industries in \r\nNauru. My Government is focused on creating the \r\nenvironment to encourage and facilitate the growth of \r\nour private sector. \r\n Nauru’s recovery and future development are \r\nparticularly vulnerable to external factors. Pacific \r\nisland developing States are greatly exposed to both \r\nthe food and the energy security crises. Dependence on \r\nimported foods, our remoteness and rising fuel and \r\ntransport costs have made both food and energy \r\nsecurity particularly critical issues for our region. \r\n That is especially true for Nauru. Consider our \r\nsituation: our island home is fringed by a narrow rim, \r\nwhere my people live just a couple of metres above sea \r\nlevel. The mining of phosphate on Nauru has left large \r\npinnacle rocks covering 80 per cent of the island, \r\nwhich prevents agriculture and contributes to \r\ndesertification and drought. \r\n Although we place a high priority on the \r\nproduction of nutritious traditional staples, arable land \r\nis just too scarce to achieve a sustainable level of food \r\nsecurity. The Secretary-General stated in his address \r\nyesterday (see A/63/PV.5) that at this time last year rice \r\ncost $330 a ton and that today it is now $730. Nauru is \r\npaying nearly double that. Our imported rice costs us \r\n$1,340 a ton. Rice and other staples are simply \r\nbecoming unaffordable. Without urgent attention to our \r\nregion, it is estimated that an additional 5 per cent of \r\nour people will slip into poverty because of high food \r\nprices. \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 20 \r\n \r\n We need the world to increase food production. \r\nThat requires investment in training and in \r\nimplementing appropriate farming techniques, together \r\nwith efficient seed and fertilizer distribution. We also \r\nneed increased access to food. That includes reviewing \r\ntrade policies on food aid. \r\n The energy crisis is anther significant external \r\nfactor that has an impact on our recovery and the \r\nsecurity of our future. Nauru already cannot afford the \r\ncost of the fuel required to provide for all its energy \r\nneeds. As a consequence, my people suffer, with \r\nscheduled power cuts of up to eight or more hours \r\nevery single day. That has an impact on parents’ ability \r\nto care for and feed their children. Without power, \r\nhouses have no running water, adding to health and \r\nsanitation problems. Power shedding limits business \r\ndevelopment and impedes government services and \r\nproductivity. \r\n The energy crisis is further disproportionately \r\nimpacting Nauru in terms of transport services. Sea, \r\nland and air, passenger and freight: all are fast \r\nbecoming unaffordable for my people, further isolating \r\nour island nation and hindering our sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We need urgent assistance, both to \r\ndevelop immediate alternative sources of energy and to \r\naccess economically viable sources of fuel. \r\n The current reliance on fossil fuels for energy has \r\nfurther particular significance for the Pacific small \r\nisland developing States. It has resulted in emissions \r\nthat are causing sea-level rise and climate change. This \r\nis not scientific theory: we are experiencing the effects \r\nright now. \r\n As with the food crisis, Nauru and the Pacific are \r\nnot contributors to the causes, but we are particularly \r\nvulnerable. We will pay the highest costs and are the \r\nfirst countries to feel the direct consequences. Global \r\nwarming is predicted conservatively to raise sea levels \r\nby one metre in this century. That will flood our only \r\nhabitable land. Our people will be literally trapped \r\nbetween the rising sea and an ancient, uninhabitable \r\ncoral field. \r\n Despite our many challenges, we are working \r\nhard to create a safe and sustainable haven from the \r\nrising sea. We must rehabilitate our mined phosphate \r\nlands and return them to a habitable, arable state. The \r\ncost of rehabilitating 80 per cent of our island is well \r\nbeyond our immediate means. Rehabilitation of the \r\nisland is a high priority, and, as part of climate change \r\nadaptation, we call for sufficient funding mechanisms, \r\nincluding support from the United Nations and \r\nfinancial and private sector institutions, to help restore \r\nour nation and improve our resilience. \r\n To address climate change as a world society, we \r\nneed to meet much of our energy needs through \r\nrenewable energy sources, and by reducing emissions \r\nfrom fuels and using cleaner fuels. But as critical as \r\nthat is for my nation, it is clear to me that the emitting \r\ncountries have yet to do all they can. We all share the \r\nsame global climate. It is therefore vital that all \r\ncountries give much greater impetus to developing \r\nalternate energy sources, increase investment and \r\nimplement real measures to address climate change. \r\n The issue of climate change for Pacific island \r\nnations is a threat to international peace and security. \r\nThe preamble to the United Nations Charter stipulates \r\nthat a primary purpose of the United Nations is to \r\nmaintain international peace and security. The Security \r\nCouncil is charged with protecting human rights, \r\ntogether with ensuring the integrity and security of \r\nStates. It is the paramount international forum \r\navailable to Pacific island countries in which to draw \r\nattention to the dangers that their islands and \r\npopulations face due to the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange. \r\n We do not expect the Security Council to become \r\ninvolved in the details of the discussions in the context \r\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, but we do expect the Security Council \r\nto keep the matter under continuous review so as to \r\nensure that all countries contribute to solving the \r\nclimate change problem and that their efforts match \r\ntheir resources and capacities. We also expect that the \r\nSecurity Council will review particularly sensitive \r\nissues such as the implications of the loss of land and \r\nresources and the displacement of people for \r\nsovereignty and international legal rights.  \r\n Nauru has incorporated the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) into its national \r\nsustainable development strategy. Pacific island \r\ncountries, including Nauru, are struggling in many \r\nareas of the MDGs as a consequence of the recent fuel \r\nand food crises and the effects of climate change. \r\n We lament the fact that the gap between promise \r\nand implementation continues to frustrate our \r\nachievement of the full range of internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals that are particularly relevant to \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n21 08-51839 \r\n \r\nsmall island developing States. It is extremely \r\ndistressing that those goals were determined by \r\nconsensus of the international community yet \r\ndeveloped countries have yet to contribute the 0.7 per \r\ncent of gross national income committed to assist \r\ndeveloping countries in meeting their targets. \r\n On the eve of the high-level event on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, may I call on the \r\nUnited Nations once more to rededicate itself to \r\nmaking development one of the highest priorities of the \r\nOrganization. I would remind the United Nations of its \r\ncommitment to open a total of eight new offices in \r\nPacific island countries. We hope that the Organization \r\nwill not waiver in its commitment to support our \r\nnational priorities in meeting the MDGs and provide us \r\nwith the urgently needed international civil servants to \r\nhelp with our pursuit of sustainable development and \r\npoverty alleviation. \r\n Sixty-three years after the United Nations was \r\nfounded on the noble ideals of establishing a peaceful, \r\nfree and tolerant global order, the world community \r\nstill suffers from the scourges of war, poverty, \r\noppression and discrimination, even as it faces today’s \r\ncolossal global challenges that threaten our very \r\nexistence. If the United Nations is to remain devoted to \r\nthe ideals upon which it was founded, it is absolutely \r\ncritical that it be reformed through the revitalization \r\nand empowerment of the General Assembly. If the \r\nUnited Nations is to remain a defender of human rights \r\nand international peace, it is crucial that the Security \r\nCouncil be expanded to better reflect geo-political \r\nrealities of the modern world. That would mean giving \r\npermanent seats to Japan, India, Germany and Brazil. \r\n If the United Nations prides itself on being an \r\ninclusive Organization that champions the rights of \r\neveryone, it cannot continue to deny the fundamental \r\nright of Taiwan’s 23 million people to participate in the \r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. It is clear \r\nto all of us that cross-Strait relations have been \r\nimproving since May 2008 and that leaders from both \r\nsides have openly shown a willingness to work \r\ntogether to create a positive atmosphere. It is now time \r\nfor the United Nations to find a solution to the \r\nexclusion of Taiwan. Only by allowing Taiwan to \r\nparticipate meaningfully in the specialized agencies of \r\nthe United Nations can the principle of universality and \r\ndemocratization of the Organization be fulfilled, and \r\nregional peace and prosperity ensured. \r\n It is very simple and straightforward: we have \r\nvowed to the people, now let us keep our promise. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n The Honourable Marcus Stephen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Elías Antonio Saca González, \r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador. \r\n Mr. Elías Antonio Saca González, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Antonio Saca \r\nGonzález, President of the Republic of El Salvador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Saca González (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFirst of all, I have the pleasure of congratulating you, \r\nSir, on being elected to preside over this session, an \r\nhonour falling to a Central American for the second \r\ntime in the history of the United Nations. I wish you \r\nevery success and commend you once again. I would \r\nalso like to express our gratitude for the work done by \r\nMr. Kerim as President of the previous session. On \r\nbehalf of El Salvador, I would also like to congratulate \r\nthe Secretary-General for the dynamism and \r\ndetermination with which he is leading the \r\nOrganization.  \r\n It seems to me very timely that the central focus \r\nof debate for this session is the impact of the global \r\nfood crisis on the issue of poverty and hunger \r\nthroughout the world, including the need to \r\ndemocratize the United Nations. It is increasingly \r\nevident every day that the world is facing a global \r\ncrisis that has a negative impact on development \r\nefforts, especially in the poorest countries. Food, \r\nclimate, energy and financial problems are aggravating \r\nthe already difficult situation of developing countries. \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 22 \r\n \r\nWe are gathered here because we have a duty to \r\nassume the political and moral responsibility to \r\nrespond to the problems currently facing the \r\ninternational community. The world must learn from \r\nboth its successes and its failures. We must learn to \r\nface crises collectively and turn them into \r\nopportunities, for no one can solve them alone any \r\nlonger.  \r\n In order to preserve the progress made in the area \r\nof development, we need to strengthen global \r\nleadership to make it both decisive and accountable. In \r\nthe current crisis, there is a danger that we could lose \r\nground.  \r\n The economic and financial system cannot be at \r\nthe mercy of markets that operate on speculation. \r\nTogether, we must rebuild a wise capitalist system that \r\nprovides financing for economic development, rather \r\nthan one that rewards speculation.  \r\n We must help to prevent and mitigate serious \r\nfinancial fluctuations. We must balance accounts and \r\nstabilize credit. I agree with the President of the French \r\nRepublic that, in order to achieve this, countries \r\ndirectly affected by the situation must meet as soon as \r\npossible to find joint solutions to what is the most \r\nacute financial crisis the world has experienced in 75 \r\nyears.  \r\n It is undeniable the rise — and above all the \r\ninstability — in the price of oil continues to have a \r\nnegative impact on development efforts in most \r\ncountries in the world, in particular the smallest and \r\nmost vulnerable among them. \r\n Here, I would like to reiterate the call I made \r\nfrom this very rostrum last year (see A/62/PV.6), for \r\noil-producing countries to seek and implement flexible \r\nmechanisms aimed at ensuring that hydrocarbon prices \r\ndo not continue to drastically affect developing \r\ncountries. Such mechanisms, of course, should not \r\nignore the harmful effects of speculation by \r\nintermediaries in the world markets.  \r\n If we do not act jointly and immediately, and if, \r\nin this forum, we are not able to come up with a \r\nbalanced solution to this problem, we will effectively \r\ncondemn oil-importing countries to bankruptcy for \r\nyears to come. We have invested in development, and \r\nwe have worked as hard as possible to achieve the \r\nMDGs; those successes will be swept aside by the \r\nexcessive and crippling prices of oil. We cannot \r\ncontinue to wait. We must take immediate political \r\ndecisions to shore up development and prevent a \r\ndeeper crisis in order to preserve global peace, security \r\nand stability.  \r\n Faced with the food crisis, which is directly \r\naffecting us all, we support the implementation of the \r\nmeasures agreed upon during the June 2008 High-\r\nLevel Conference on World Food Security: the \r\nChallenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy. We call \r\nfor action and assistance, particularly for affected \r\ndeveloping countries.  \r\n We would like to congratulate the Group of Eight \r\n(G8) on its decision to support, in the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations system, the establishment of a world \r\nagriculture and food association, and the identification \r\nof a range of actions to address the food crisis, \r\nincluding through the participation of major \r\ninstitutions. \r\n In the face of this tangle of problems that require \r\ncreative responses, the countries of the Central \r\nAmerican Integration System (SICA) advocate the \r\ninitiative on action under the Staple Grains Plan, which \r\nconcentrates in particular on strengthening technical \r\nassistance and public and private assistance and a \r\nprogramme for financing, land leasing and a temporary \r\nworker programme. \r\n The countries of SICA and Brazil, during \r\nEl Salvador’s pro tempore presidency of that \r\norganization, supported the holding of a special session \r\nof the General Assembly on the world food and energy \r\ncrisis. As a result, a high-level meeting on food \r\nsecurity was held, beginning on 18 July, in this very \r\nHall, during which El Salvador explained the actions \r\nthat we have undertaken in order to deal with the crisis \r\nin Central America, particularly in the most vulnerable \r\nareas.  \r\n In our country, El Salvador, we are responding \r\nwith social programmes aimed at reducing extreme \r\npoverty, fighting hunger and infant malnutrition, and \r\nattaining other MDGs. At the next Ibero-American \r\nsummit of heads of State or Government, which will be \r\nheld in El Salvador, the subject of children under the \r\nage of five will be a matter of priority. \r\n In order to counter the impact of the economic \r\ncrisis on Salvadoranian households, we have created a \r\nmultidisciplinary commission with broad participation, \r\nwhich has proposed a series of measures to address \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n23 08-51839 \r\n \r\ncurrent effects and promote a social pact of national \r\nsolidarity for productivity and employment. Those \r\nsolutions involve business people, workers, political \r\nparties and civil society bodies, and the creation of a \r\ncommittee for the implementation of viable priority \r\nactions. \r\n One of the most successful measures that we have \r\nimplemented in El Salvador to prevent a food crisis is \r\nthe promotion of improved seed varieties for staple \r\ngrains, which has enabled us to achieve record \r\nproduction this year.  \r\n However, I have to tell the Assembly that all the \r\nefforts of solidarity we make as a global forum or as \r\nindividual countries require broad participation, \r\ndemocratic stability, the enjoyment of full individual \r\nliberties, and a genuine sense of social responsibility \r\non the part of Governments, irrespective of their \r\nideologies. International cooperation is also important \r\nfor strengthening national and regional efforts. That is \r\nwhy El Salvador has insisted on the issue of \r\ncooperation with middle-income countries.  \r\n In October 2007, at San Salvador, we held the \r\nsecond International Conference on Development \r\nCooperation with Middle-Income Countries. In August \r\n2008, in Namibia, my country co-chaired the third \r\nConference on that subject. At that meeting, we agreed \r\non measures including improving access to markets, \r\nreducing poverty, fulfilling the MDGs, increasing the \r\ncompetitiveness of our economies and improving our \r\nphysical and financial infrastructures.  \r\n The problems we face require decisive measures \r\nto be taken. In that respect, I would ask all Member \r\nStates to support the fulfilment and implementation of \r\nthe commitments agreed upon in the El Salvador \r\nConsensus and the Namibia Declaration, as well as the \r\nconsideration of this topic at the Global Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development in Doha. Those efforts \r\nshould lead to a General Assembly resolution with the \r\nobjective of reviewing current practices in the area of \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\n For middle-income countries, injustice is clearly \r\nto be seen in international cooperation. The \r\ncommitment I propose should lead us to swiftly \r\nprepare a multidisciplinary plan of action, global in its \r\nscope, in order to strengthen development cooperation \r\nfor middle-income countries. We believe that new \r\ntypes of development cooperation must also be \r\nincluded, such as South-South cooperation, triangular \r\ncooperation, the exchange of debt for investment in \r\nsocial areas, such as health, education and the \r\nenvironment, as we are already doing with Spain, \r\nFrance and Germany. All of this could help us to attain \r\nall of the MDGs and to meet other parameters \r\nestablished by the United Nations.  \r\n In my view, it is important that as we seek \r\nsolutions to all of those problems, we never abandon \r\nour ongoing efforts to achieve the MDGs. In that \r\nrespect, I am very happy to describe some of the \r\nachievements we made during the period from 2001 to \r\n2007.  \r\n Extreme poverty at the national level was reduced \r\nfrom 32.6 per cent in 2001 to 12.8 per cent in 2007. \r\nWith regard to education, the net rate of school \r\nenrolment increased from 78 to 93 per cent during that \r\nsame period. The percentage of schoolchildren who \r\nenter the first grade of primary school and complete the \r\nfifth grade has increased from 58 to 80 per cent, and \r\nthe literacy rate for young people between the ages of \r\n15 and 24 has increased from 85 to 95 per cent. I \r\nwould also like to inform you that the Constitution of \r\nEl Salvador stipulates that primary education must be \r\nfree. With tremendous effort, our Government has \r\nachieved and established free secondary education in \r\nall El Salvador’s public education institutions. \r\n With regard to environmental sustainability, the \r\npercentage of the population without access to drinking \r\nwater dropped from 23.9 to 12.1 per cent and without \r\naccess to sanitation from 21.9 to 8.1 per cent.  \r\n In the fight against HIV/AIDS, I am very pleased \r\nto report on the major efforts that we have undertaken \r\nin El Salvador to help those suffering from \r\nHIV/AIDS — first and foremost, universal free \r\nantiretroviral drugs for all those who need them, with a \r\ngreat number of decentralized hospitals providing that \r\ntreatment. In the last four years, we have managed to \r\nreduce the mortality rate of those with HIV/AIDS by \r\n35 per cent and the number of children born with \r\nHIV/AIDS by 89.14 per cent, falling from 150 to \r\n15 children annually.  \r\n With regard to implementing the goals of the \r\nSpecial Session of the General Assembly on Children \r\nin 2002, contained in the Plan of Action Creating a \r\nWorld Fit for Children (A/S-27/19/Rev.1), I am pleased \r\nto report the progress El Salvador has made. We have \r\nachieved 15 of the 35 goals, particularly in the \r\nreduction of extreme poverty, immunization, infant and \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 24 \r\n \r\nmaternal mortality and education of children and \r\nadolescents. \r\n Programmes such as the Solidarity Network, \r\nwhich maps poverty in order to identify extreme \r\npoverty, Alliance with the Family with 19 measures to \r\nhelp the family purse, Solidarity Fund for Health and \r\nhealthy schools have been key to those successes. I \r\nmust underline that we have achieved some of the \r\ntargets established under the Millennium Development \r\nGoals before the 2015 deadline, in particular \r\nconcerning poverty reduction, gender equality and \r\naccess to drinking water. That is why we support the \r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General to hold a summit in \r\n2010 to review the progress made in implementing the \r\nGoals.  \r\n With regard to existing regional asymmetries, and \r\neven more those between developed and \r\nunderdeveloped countries, and the role the United \r\nNations should play regarding sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the Member States need a modern, strong \r\nglobal Organization with institutions able effectively to \r\nface the new challenges of the current international \r\nsituation. \r\n To that end, El Salvador would like to reiterate its \r\nresolute support for the United Nations reform process, \r\nso that the purposes and principles for which the \r\nOrganization was created in 1945 can be fulfilled, \r\nparticularly today when we are facing global threats \r\nagainst peace, security, human rights and international \r\ncooperation — fundamental pillars of development. \r\n Security Council reform is particularly important \r\nas part of that effort, and in that respect, we would like \r\nto stress the need to bring changes to make that \r\ninstitution more representative, democratic and \r\ntransparent, so as to adapt it to the current international \r\nsituation. \r\n From this rostrum, I should like to reiterate once \r\nagain our profound appreciation to the United Nations \r\nsystem for supporting the process of coordinating and \r\nreinforcing the peace agreements in El Salvador. \r\nToday, El Salvador is a model. We are living witnesses \r\nof the fundamental role of the United Nations in \r\nguaranteeing peace and stability.  \r\n Mindful of our experience, El Salvador is \r\nparticipating actively as Vice-Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Similarly, we have become \r\na troop-contributing country within the United Nations \r\nsystem, a role that we are proud to assume to defend \r\nworld peace and security in times of need. On that \r\nbasis, we have participated and continue to take part in \r\noperations in Côte d’Ivoire, Western Sahara, Liberia, \r\nIraq and Haiti, and recently, we joined the Spanish \r\ncontingent in the United Nations Interim Force in \r\nLebanon. \r\n Migration, particularly when undocumented, has \r\nincreasingly become a source of differences, instability \r\nand conflict. As a country of origin, transit and \r\ndestination for migratory flows, we appeal for the \r\ncontinued strengthening of actions to combat and \r\nprevent the illegal trafficking of migrants and trade in \r\npersons in all their forms and for guaranteeing full \r\nprotection and support for the victims of those crimes, \r\nparticularly women and children. \r\n While respecting the sovereign rights of States \r\nwith regard to their immigration policies, we call for a \r\ncomprehensive approach to international migration that \r\nvalues the positive contributions made by immigrants \r\nto the economy and culture of the communities where \r\nthey live, and favours schemes in support of controlled \r\nmigration, including temporary work programmes. I \r\nshould like to point out that, in the United States alone, \r\naround 12 million undocumented migrants reside, \r\nawaiting humane and comprehensive immigration \r\nreform. They are good, hard-working people, who have \r\nsacrificed their lives to support their families. \r\n Another subject on which we must try to achieve \r\nconsensus is climate change and global warming. I \r\nwould like to stress that our country is meeting its \r\ncommitment to support international efforts to address \r\nthe effects of climate change. \r\n In that regard, El Salvador is actively \r\nparticipating in the international negotiations aimed at \r\ncreating an instrument that will complement the Kyoto \r\nProtocol on the emission of greenhouse gases after \r\n2012, and awaits the and successful conclusion of \r\nthose negotiations in 2009 at the conference in \r\nCopenhagen, Denmark.  \r\n In the context of Central America, on 28 May \r\n2008, the Presidents of the countries in the region \r\nadopted, at the invitation of my colleague and friend \r\nPresident Manuel José Zelaya Rosales of Honduras, the \r\nDeclaration of San Pedro Sula on climate change and \r\nthe environment, which set out guidelines for tackling \r\nthe serious problems arising from climate change. In \r\nEl Salvador, recently we launched the innovative \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n25 08-51839 \r\n \r\nproject Green Network, which seeks to involve \r\nGovernment and private institutions and the Ministries \r\nof the Environment and of Education in the protection \r\nof the environment through the implementation of \r\nprogrammes to improve social and environmental \r\nconditions for the most vulnerable. \r\n That initiative has encouraged participation in \r\nareas such as water security, judicious use of timber to \r\nprotect the forests, recycling in schools, energy saving \r\nand responsible environmental business policies. \r\n As the emissary of a nation that lives in \r\ndemocracy and peace, respecting human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, I should like to reiterate once \r\nagain, on behalf of El Salvador, our firm support for \r\nthe aspirations of the people of the Republic of China \r\nin Taiwan to participate in the international \r\ninstitutional structure, particularly in the United \r\nNations system. We support the initiative to examine \r\nthe participation of that country in the specialized \r\nagencies of the United Nations, with particular \r\nemphasis on the fact that the people of that country \r\ncannot and should not remain isolated from the \r\ninternational community and could contribute \r\nexperience, resources and knowledge to deal with the \r\nchallenges that we all face. \r\n I also wish to refer to the case of Palestine. \r\nPalestine should have its own State, as does Israel, with \r\nsecure borders. I think that the United Nations should \r\nplay a greater and more active role in ensuring that the \r\nPalestinian people have their own territory and that the \r\nterritory of Israel is also respected through secure \r\nborders. \r\n This is the fifth time during my administration \r\nthat the Government of El Salvador has been \r\nrepresented at the highest level in this important forum, \r\nwhich is the universal and most democratic body in our \r\nOrganization. My presence in the General Assembly \r\nand in other high-level meetings to discuss matters of \r\nglobal interest constitutes an unequivocal \r\ndemonstration of the importance and relevance we all \r\nattach to the work of the United Nations. \r\n I would like to finalize my intervention as the \r\nPresident of El Salvador in this forum. I hope that the \r\nOrganization will be strengthened on the basis of \r\nunderstanding, solidarity and the political will of all of \r\nits Members. I am absolutely convinced that if we \r\ncombine our wills, our abilities and our resources, we \r\nwill be able to steer the United Nations so that it may \r\neffectively fulfil its role of promoting peace, security, \r\njustice and sustainable development. \r\n Despite the problems in the world, I am an \r\neternal optimist. Problems always have solutions, and \r\nit is easier to find those solutions together. We must \r\npromote tolerance and human dignity. There is no \r\ngreater bastion for peace and brotherhood than \r\nunderstanding and respect for our diversity, our beliefs \r\nand our fundamental values, if we are to live together \r\npeacefully and with solidarity between nations.  \r\n I also wish to state today, within this global \r\nforum, that the Central America of 20 years ago has \r\ndisappeared, that the world’s image of it is mistaken. \r\nThe Central American countries and the Central \r\nAmerican Integration System — SICA — are working \r\nwell. Integration is accelerating. Over the last three \r\nyears we have made more progress in Central \r\nAmerican integration than we have made over the last \r\nfifty years.  \r\n Central America has taken valiant, bold \r\ndecisions, among them the customs union. Guatemala, \r\nEl Salvador and Honduras will be making progress in \r\nthe next few weeks in the area of customs — free \r\nmovement of people and goods in a Central America of \r\n40 million people living in an atmosphere of peace and \r\ntranquility, with the normal problems of any country, \r\nbut with many exchanges and closer contacts between \r\nleaders. \r\n Thanks to all, and may the supreme Creator guide \r\nus towards those great goals. May God bless our \r\nOrganization, the whole world and Central America, \r\nand may God bless the Earth to which El Salvador \r\nbelongs. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nEl Salvador for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Elías Antonio Saca González, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname. \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 26 \r\n \r\n Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Runaldo \r\nRonald Venetiaan, President of the Republic of \r\nSuriname, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Venetiaan: Allow me to congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. I am pleased to see \r\na member of our regional group of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean in that high office. I am convinced that \r\nyour longstanding diplomatic experience and in-depth \r\nknowledge of current international issues will enable \r\nyou to successfully discharge the high responsibility of \r\nyour office. I would also like to recognize the able \r\nstewardship and valuable work of your predecessor, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, during the Assembly’s sixty-second \r\nsession. \r\n To the Secretary-General of the Organization, His \r\nExcellency Ban Ki-moon, I pledge Suriname’s full \r\nsupport in implementing the resolutions of the United \r\nNations to achieve the objectives of the United Nations \r\nCharter for sustainable development, international \r\npeace and security and respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. \r\n We are commemorating the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this \r\nyear, while many of these rights are still under serious \r\npressure. New threats, such as global warming and \r\nclimate change and most recently the global food and \r\nenergy crises, are an infringement on people’s rights to \r\nfood, health, education, security and the overall \r\nfreedom to live in dignity. Those tribulations are \r\nintertwined and universal and thus beyond the control \r\nof any single nation. Millions of vulnerable people are \r\ntherefore looking to the international community, with \r\nthe United Nations at the helm, for effective measures \r\nto bring some kind of relief. \r\n The Economic and Social Council recently \r\nrecognized the seriousness and complexity of the \r\nglobal food crisis and reiterated that its consequences \r\nrequire a comprehensive response by national \r\nGovernments and the international community. It is \r\nessential for us to intensify our combined efforts, and \r\nwe therefore support the emergency global partnership \r\nplan for food, called for by Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon in his address to the General Assembly high-\r\nlevel event on the global food and climate change \r\ncrises. \r\n The financial and monetary implications of the \r\nglobal crisis require substantial political and financial \r\ncommitments from us all, from national Governments, \r\nfrom multilateral organizations, including international \r\nfinancial institutions, and from the private sector. We \r\nwill have to change the way that we, human beings, \r\nbehave towards Mother Nature and we will have to \r\nfind a solution to policies and regulations that are \r\ndetrimental to our progress, such as protectionist \r\nagricultural policies in developed countries that are \r\ncausing low production in the agricultural sector of \r\nmany developing countries. If we do not find lasting \r\nsolutions now, the cost of our inaction will be \r\nunacceptably high, and the threats that we will most \r\nlikely pass on to the next generation will be \r\ndevastating. \r\n My country, Suriname, was on the right track \r\ntowards achieving some of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, including poverty reduction \r\nsustained by economic growth rates of over 5 per cent \r\nannually in the past three years, with predictions by \r\nrenowned international financial institutions of \r\napproximately 8 per cent growth for the coming years. \r\nAs a result of the current food and energy crises, as \r\nwell as the recent volatility of financial markets, it has \r\nnow become a challenge for us to keep up the pace and \r\nquality of our development. \r\n My Government has taken action and has already \r\nput some measures in place to respond to the new \r\ndifficulties we are facing because of those external \r\ndevelopments. We have expanded social security to \r\ncover the most needy, such as children, the elderly and \r\npeople with disabilities, we have put in place food \r\nprogrammes for schoolchildren, and we have increased \r\nsalaries and Government pensions, which had \r\nweakened as a result of years of inflation. The \r\nGovernment has now called upon the private sector to \r\nfollow its lead and restore eroded salaries and \r\npensions. \r\n Africa, the cradle of humanity, is a continent with \r\nimmense capability, endowed with indispensable \r\nhuman and natural potential. Paradoxically, in many \r\nparts of the continent, development is lagging behind \r\nor even absent, and development perspectives are \r\nbleak. \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n27 08-51839 \r\n \r\n My country commends Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for holding the important high-level meeting \r\non “Africa’s development needs: state of \r\nimplementation of various commitments, challenges \r\nand the way forward”, which took place just two days \r\nago. It is our genuine expectation that the outcome of \r\nthat meeting will lead to new and unique opportunities \r\nfor impacting positively on and contributing to the \r\ndevelopment of Africa. \r\n Suriname remains committed to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. My country \r\nunderscores the principle of equality before the law \r\nand emphasizes that everyone should be held \r\naccountable for their actions. Against that backdrop, \r\nSuriname acceded to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court on 15 July of this year. \r\nWe thus expressed our commitment to fighting the \r\nimpunity of the perpetrators of gross human rights \r\nviolations. However, providing the Court with its full \r\npotential to meet its mandate depends on a collective \r\ncommitment at the global level. \r\n Environmental disturbances today are of such \r\nmagnitude that we can no longer ignore their negative \r\nimpact on the world’s resources. As a country with 90 \r\nper cent of its territory covered by forests within which \r\nlies one of the largest stretches of pristine tropical \r\nrainforests on earth, Suriname is aware of its value and \r\npotential to contribute to the global mitigation of \r\nclimate change, the conservation of biodiversity and \r\nthe protection of water resources. \r\n However, the contribution of the international \r\ncommunity to the preservation and protection of such \r\nglobally valuable resources is not proportionate to the \r\nsacrifice made by the forested countries. Moreover, \r\nforested countries like Suriname with very low \r\ndeforestation rates are forgotten in mechanisms devised \r\nto compensate for deforestation. \r\n Suriname recently hosted the Paramaribo \r\nDialogue, a country-led initiative on financing for \r\nsustainable forest management in support of the United \r\nNations Forum on Forests. During that international \r\ndialogue, multiple stakeholders from all over the world \r\ncame together to develop substantive proposals for the \r\nestablishment of an international financial framework \r\nto assist in future sustainable forest management. \r\n We stress the importance of new financing \r\nmechanisms, since good management of forests and \r\nother natural resources cannot and should not be at the \r\nexpense of the development of our own peoples, the \r\npeoples of countries with high forest coverage and low \r\ndeforestation rates. We therefore look forward to \r\nsubstantial investments to support the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of such countries. \r\n Suriname has supported the restructuring process \r\nof the United Nations from the start, with the aim of \r\nachieving a more effective and efficient Organization \r\nthat would be better equipped to adequately address \r\nold and new challenges. In that process, we expect that \r\nthe role of the United Nations as a partner in \r\ndevelopment will gain further relevance and achieve a \r\nmore coherent and enhanced presence in support of \r\ncapacity-building and sustainable development. \r\n Suriname is also currently engaged in a “One \r\nUN” policy process, through which it responds to the \r\nneed for coherent involvement of the United Nations in \r\nits development efforts. To that end, Suriname and the \r\nUnited Nations agencies signed the Country \r\nProgramme Action Plan for the period 2008-2011, \r\nwhich also addresses the pursuit of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n We have entered an era of growing anxieties and \r\nconcerns that go beyond national borders. The \r\ncontemporary world situation requires harmonization \r\nof the United Nations with current international \r\ndevelopments. Suriname believes that the United \r\nNations should be given the tools and instruments to \r\nenable the Organization to address global challenges in \r\nsupport of a comprehensive and coherent development \r\nagenda in the interest of all the nations of the world. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Suriname for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Runaldo Ronald Venetiaan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President \r\nof the Republic of Guatemala \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala. \r\n  Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 28 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Álvaro Colom \r\nCaballeros, President of the Republic of Guatemala, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Caballeros (spoke in Spanish): It is an \r\nhonour for me to represent my country, Guatemala, in \r\nthis high international forum. It is an honour for me to \r\nrepresent a people who have fought for their well-being \r\nand freedom for decades, specifically the past 54 years. \r\nMy Administration is an expression of precisely that \r\ndesire, because, after all those years, governmental \r\nactions are now being prioritized around the human \r\nperson, the concepts of solidarity and social cohesion \r\nand, especially, in the 254 days since I took office, \r\nattention to the poorest and most marginalized among \r\nour population, in particular the 23 indigenous peoples \r\nthat constitute our nation.  \r\n First, I should like to commend Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, whom we, with much Central \r\nAmerican pride, see presiding over the General \r\nAssembly at its present session, following in the \r\nfootsteps of a fellow Guatemalan, Mr. Emilio Arenales \r\nCatalán. I know that Miguel’s experience and life \r\nexample will ensure the success of this session.  \r\n I also wish to thank the United Nations for \r\nassisting Guatemala in its peace process and for \r\nfollowing up on it with the United Nations Verification \r\nMission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and, most \r\nrecently, with the presence of the International \r\nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a \r\nunique mechanism that will help us combat \r\nimpunity — indeed, we are the only country to have \r\nsuch a mechanism.  \r\n Participating in the present session of the \r\nAssembly are world leaders who will be remembered \r\nin 10 or 20 years’ time for having had the wisdom to \r\nemerge from the present crisis — a crisis regarding \r\nwhich, in certain areas and at certain times, there has \r\nbeen a marked absence of global solidarity. I join \r\nMiguel d’Escoto Brockmann in his appeal for \r\nsolidarity. I believe that the great remedy for this crisis \r\nis global solidarity. We have globalized trade and \r\ninformation, but we have not gained the wisdom to \r\nglobalize humanity or to globalize labour to ensure that \r\nmigrants are not treated as criminals and that — like \r\nproducts, trade and money — they have freedom of \r\nmovement across borders. Our migrants seek nothing \r\nmore than the opportunities offered by globalization \r\nand the opening of borders. It was that very opening \r\nthat worsened their poverty and encouraged them to \r\nabandon their communities.  \r\n That is why I am making a special appeal and \r\nproposal to the Secretary-General that we no longer try \r\nto resolve the problem of migration bilaterally; rather, \r\nwe must do so as a bloc. For example, I should like to \r\npropose that the United Nations create a forum \r\ncomposed of former Presidents of countries of origin \r\nand countries receiving great numbers of migrants, \r\nsuch as the brotherly countries of El Salvador, \r\nHonduras, Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. \r\nTogether, in six months’ time, we could formulate a \r\nspecific proposal to finally put an end to a situation \r\nthat is a scourge for so many families, so many \r\nGuatemalans and many other nations.  \r\n I should also like to discuss the scourges of drug \r\ntrafficking and organized crime, which greatly afflict \r\nour populations. Only 254 days after taking office, our \r\nGovernment has begun a comprehensive process of \r\nreforming the security forces. We have changed the \r\nhigh command of the army and the entire command of \r\nthe national police so that we can fight impunity \r\ntogether with CICIG and the United Nations system. \r\nThus, Guatemala can finally achieve the true, firm and \r\nlasting peace for which, with such hope, we signed an \r\nagreement here on 29 December 1996.  \r\n Everything that happens in the outside world \r\naffects us. Foreign manipulation and speculation \r\nrelated to oil and food affects us. As my good friend \r\nPresident Saca of El Salvador said earlier, our \r\ncountries are accomplishing their national tasks. In 254 \r\ndays, my Government has, through social cohesion, \r\nreturned to the people of Guatemala what belongs to \r\nthem under their Constitution: free education and \r\nhealth care — totally free, as stipulated in the \r\nConstitution. We have broken a paradigm. In \r\nGuatemala, it used to be forbidden to get sick after \r\n5 p.m., because the country’s health clinics closed at \r\nthat time. Today, 52 municipalities out of a total of 333 \r\nalready have comprehensive health services. In \r\naddition, 300,000 children now have renovated schools \r\nwith teachers, desks and all the necessary equipment.  \r\n With determination, we can do what is required, \r\nbut we need solidarity among everyone. We need and \r\nparticipate in Central American solidarity, which \r\nenables us to tell the world that the free market works. \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n29 08-51839 \r\n \r\nWe have had a common market for 50 years, and we \r\nknow that it works. But we also know that that \r\ncommon market requires social solidarity among \r\nourselves. \r\n I have always believed that solidarity is not \r\ngiving what one has left over, but rather giving what \r\nsomeone else needs; it is very easy to give what one \r\nhas left over. Giving what someone else needs requires \r\nwill and solidarity. We are aware of — and have heard \r\nour colleagues’ statements about — this international \r\ncrisis, but there is a much deeper crisis. The crises that \r\nthe world’s leaders must face are the crisis of hunger, \r\nthe crisis of discrimination and the crisis of poverty. It \r\nis the crisis of hunger that all the Governments present \r\nhere today are fighting against, but that is also a global \r\nissue. We in Guatemala are a people of maize, but a \r\nfew years ago they said it was bad business to plant \r\nmaize and destroyed the production systems. Today, \r\nGuatemala imports maize. \r\n I believe that now is the time for solidarity and \r\ntrue global security. Perhaps civil security is the easiest \r\nto achieve, despite the fact that my country is complex. \r\nSovereignty of food, sovereignty of health, sovereignty \r\nof knowledge — these are more difficult to achieve.  \r\n We have planned to achieve solidarity, \r\nproductivity, a regional spirit and governance. We have \r\nestablished a system of national dialogue that is \r\nenabling all the country’s social sectors to come to the \r\nnegotiating table, to arrive at a true national \r\nunderstanding and to begin rebuilding a country that, \r\nfor 54 years, was afflicted by marginalization, the cold \r\nwar, hunger and bad Governments.  \r\n I am convinced that new times have come for \r\nLatin America. I am convinced that all our Latin \r\nAmerican summits and meetings herald new times. We \r\nhave our differences and individual characteristics, but \r\nLatin America has begun to look north, south and to \r\nthe centre, to the Caribbean, and we see a continent \r\nwith the possibility of stronger unity, of stronger \r\nhorizontal South-South cooperation and North-South \r\ncooperation. Our neighbours, our dear Central \r\nAmerica — we are peoples rooted in the region who \r\nwant a strong and united Central America. \r\n This Assembly could take a momentous turn for \r\nour future as a planet. Of course we are concerned by \r\nclimate change, but we have to maintain our Mayan \r\nbiosphere so that others can breathe while our \r\ncommunities are dying of hunger. That is solidarity. We \r\ngive oxygen, but we receive technology. We give \r\noxygen, but we receive solidarity. We give oxygen, and \r\nwe receive the understanding of countries that we \r\ndeserve a better fate on the basis of this international \r\nsolidarity.  \r\n We have also promoted tax reform. It is no secret \r\nfor many that tax reform in Guatemala meant problems \r\nand coups d’état. But now we have tax reform, with a \r\ngood level of consensus. There is also commitment to \r\ntransparency and to the quality of expenditures. In only \r\n254 days 7 per cent of the national budget was directed \r\nto the poor, money that used to be and today would \r\nhave been spent entirely on other things and without \r\nreference to the poor. Seven towns have begun to lower \r\ntheir maternal mortality indicators. Health centres are \r\npacked, because they now provide services and they \r\nare open. There are significantly more children in \r\nschools in the 45 towns that are priorities. This can be \r\ndone, if there is the determination to do it. \r\n Our security is perhaps the greatest while El \r\nSalvador, Colombia and Mexico are more successful in \r\nfighting drug trafficking. Guatemala pays the bills. \r\nThat is why in this brief time I wish to thank my \r\nneighbours, Colombia, for the support that they have \r\ngiven us so that we can confront drug trafficking and \r\norganized crime on a regional scale. Our young people \r\nshould not have to pay for the weaknesses of others. \r\nOur unassuming people and our indigenous people \r\nshould not have to pay for the vices of others. I believe \r\nthat if we work regionally things will go better.  \r\n I should like to acknowledge and reiterate our \r\ngratitude to the United Nations system for the peace in \r\nGuatemala that was sought during the eight years of \r\nnegotiations, in which I had the honour to take part. Its \r\nfollow-up with the United Nations Mission for the \r\nVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with \r\nthe Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on \r\nHuman Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and now \r\nwith the presence of the International Commission \r\nagainst Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) makes it easier \r\nfor us to take the difficult road towards the integration \r\nand development of Guatemala and towards equity in \r\nGuatemala. \r\n I should like to share with members that the \r\nprogrammes for social cohesion that were learned and \r\ndeveloped in Guatemala, but also acquired in friendly \r\ncountries, are yielding results. The “My Family Makes \r\nProgress” programme is now affecting 40,000 families, \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 30 \r\n \r\nand the young people are going to school and to health \r\nfacilities. The “Shopping Bag Solidarity” programme is \r\nyielding results in the urban areas, and “Open Schools” \r\nis reducing delinquency in the areas of higher risk in \r\nGuatemala City. \r\n If we had the courage to globalize the economy \r\nwe would now have the challenge, and almost the \r\nobligation, to globalize all of mankind. Such \r\nglobalization would lead to comprehensive, global \r\nsolidarity; it could be the way to save our planet. It \r\ncould be that we save it by combining our successes \r\nand trying to avoid our errors. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, and with great pride, I wish to \r\nthank the President of the Republic of Guatemala for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland. \r\n  Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Lech \r\nKaczyński, President of the Republic of Poland, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Kaczyński (spoke in Polish; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): Let me start by \r\nexpressing my respect and gratitude to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its previous session, \r\nMr. Srgjan Kerim, whose active involvement and \r\ninitiatives have contributed to a broader Assembly \r\nagenda and facilitated its work. I wish to extend my \r\ncongratulations to his successor, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann. I congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nappointment and wish you fruitful work. \r\n The past year has seen many new challenges and \r\nproblems with which the international community has \r\nto deal. In our attempts to respond to these problems \r\nand to search for the best solutions we have recognized \r\nyet again that different crises cannot be successfully \r\novercome without referring to such universal values as \r\ndemocracy, freedom and solidarity. \r\n One of the biggest global challenges at present is \r\nthe food crisis and its consequences. The decision to \r\nmake that issue the central theme of this year’s General \r\nAssembly session testifies to the special role of the \r\nUnited Nations as a forum for debate focused on major \r\nglobal challenges. Poland appreciates the initiative to \r\njuxtapose the debate on the food crisis with discussions \r\nabout the need to democratize the United Nations, as it \r\nis only a democratic and effective United Nations that \r\ncan face up to the global challenges of eliminating \r\nhunger and poverty and ensuring the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the poorest nations. That is why we \r\nremain certain that the United Nations reform process \r\nshould continue.  \r\n One of the fundamentals of the democratic \r\ngovernance of the United Nations is the rule “one \r\nState, one vote”. Each State should be given the \r\nopportunity to decide in which direction the United \r\nNations will head, and the General Assembly remains \r\nthe most important forum for such democratic debate. \r\nIn this context, it is especially important to streamline \r\nthe decision-making mechanism.  \r\n We are in favour of accelerating the pace of work \r\non Security Council reform. The number of \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council should be \r\nincreased so as to truly reflect today’s world. Let us \r\nremember that some of the rules in that regard were \r\nlaid down in a world that was fundamentally different \r\nfrom today’s.  \r\n “Everyone has the right to a standard of living \r\nadequate for the health and well-being of himself and \r\nof his family, including food, clothing, housing and \r\nmedical care and necessary social services”: that \r\nprinciple is enshrined in article 25 of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, whose sixtieth \r\nanniversary we celebrate this year. As an international \r\ncommunity, we bear responsibility for their fulfilment.  \r\n Fighting against hunger and poverty is among the \r\neight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has \r\nbeen almost eight years since the international \r\ncommunity set them. Despite numerous declarations \r\nand commitments we are still short of achieving the \r\nGoals. It will be impossible to overcome the current \r\ncrisis or carry out our development policies unless — \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n31 08-51839 \r\n \r\nand I stress this — every country shoulders its \r\nindividual responsibility, takes concrete steps and \r\nassesses the progress made so far. We should make \r\njoint efforts to promote a global development \r\nprogramme with the MDGs as its basis.  \r\n It was in that vein that Poland joined British \r\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown in endorsing the call to \r\naction on the MDGs. We hope that that statement, \r\nwhich reflects a broad understanding among countries, \r\nbusiness representatives, non-governmental organizations \r\nand faith groups will contribute to the full attainment of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We believe that \r\nthe high-level meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals taking place on 25 September will \r\nresult in concrete commitments that will be \r\nimplemented in a timely manner: timeliness is of \r\nspecial importance. \r\n As we analyse the causes of the food crisis and \r\ntry to find effective prescriptions for combating \r\npoverty and hunger, we take note of the immense \r\nnegative impact of climate change on these \r\nphenomena. Although the consequences of climate \r\nchange will be felt globally, it is the poorest who will \r\nbear the brunt and who will be hurt the most severely. \r\nIt goes without saying that, without solidarity, \r\nresponsibility and enhanced mutual cooperation, \r\ndeveloping countries will not be able to fulfil their \r\ncommitments regarding reductions in greenhouse gas \r\nemissions and will fail to successfully adapt to climate \r\nchange. This calls for a certain change of philosophy in \r\nour approach, and for much greater effort on the part of \r\nthe North in favour of the South. What I am saying \r\nnow is mere short hand: the rich should become much \r\nmore committed to helping the poor. The United \r\nNations is, if not the sole organization, then definitely \r\nthe principal organization that can implement these \r\nobjectives. \r\n Poland wants to be an active partner in the \r\ninternational community’s activities to that end. With \r\nthis in mind, we will be hosting in Poznan in December \r\nthis year the fourteenth session of the Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the fourth Meeting \r\nof the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. One of the key \r\nchallenges facing this year’s Conference is to work out \r\nsolutions and mechanisms that will support and bring \r\nabout true systemic change in developing countries. It \r\nis especially vital to ensure the funding of investments \r\nthat will help to modernize the economies of those \r\ncountries and help them reduce carbon dioxide \r\nemissions and adapt to climate change. I reiterate that \r\nthere is no possibility of implementing these objectives \r\nwithout a major change in thinking, especially by the \r\ncountries that now have the most resources. We hope \r\nthat this year’s Poznan Conference will lay strong \r\nfoundations for reaching a new agreement in \r\nCopenhagen in December next year.  \r\n As holder of the presidency of the fourteenth \r\nsession of the Conference of Parties, Poland will strive \r\nto bring the positions of major countries as close as \r\npossible so as to ensure maximum progress during the \r\nPoznan Conference. We anticipate cooperation and \r\nsupport from our international partners and friends. We \r\ngreatly appreciate the Secretary-General’s deep \r\ncommitment to the implementation of these objectives. \r\n Introducing new, more climate-friendly \r\ntechnologies should be coupled with enhanced energy \r\nsecurity and diversification of energy sources. As we \r\ndo not yet have mechanisms to guarantee solidarity on \r\nthe energy crisis among all States members of the \r\nEuropean Union — I refer to the European Union but \r\nthis is also applicable to all other States of the world — \r\nthe issue of energy security becomes our priority. \r\n Poland is following developments in Georgia \r\nwith concern. We believe that engaging in dialogue and \r\nacting in a spirit of solidarity and consistency in \r\nimplementing energy policy should become a priority \r\nfor all European States, especially European Union \r\nStates. It is only in that way that Europe can be assured \r\nof energy security, especially at a time of the complete \r\nunpredictability of actions of the current main \r\nsuppliers of energy to Europe. \r\n Poland’s concern arises from the abuse by some \r\nStates, especially one very powerful State, of energy as \r\na tool to achieve political goals in relations with \r\nneighbours and with all the other nations that benefit \r\nfrom the supply of energy by that State. \r\n Thus it is of fundamental importance to diversify \r\nthe sources of supply, to introduce transparent rules \r\nregulating the energy trade and to extend transport \r\ninfrastructure, especially by developing alternative \r\nroutes and energy sources for the European Union, \r\nmainly from the Caspian Sea, Central Asia and the \r\nMiddle East. This could significantly accelerate the \r\ndevelopment of the States of those areas and enhance \r\ntheir potential as part of global solidarity. \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 32 \r\n \r\n I have referred to Georgia in the context of \r\nenergy security. But the situation in that country is far \r\nmore serious. Several weeks ago we witnessed an \r\nillegal military aggression and the division of the \r\ncountry. That was an aggression against an independent \r\nState. Fundamental principles of international law, such \r\nas the inviolability of borders and respect for territorial \r\nintegrity, were breached. \r\n Without respect for those principles, the world \r\nwill be a hotbed of not one but hundreds of conflicts. \r\nWe cannot allow the relativization of international law. \r\nWe cannot accept that international law is applicable to \r\nthe weak but not binding on the strong. If we do, \r\ninternational law will have no positive impact, \r\nespecially as concerns the principle of territorial \r\nintegrity. We must not allow the undermining of a \r\nprinciple on the basis of which the United Nations was \r\nestablished 63 years ago in the aftermath of the Second \r\nWorld War as a consequence of the bankruptcy of the \r\nLeague of Nations. That founding principle of the \r\nUnited Nations is the principle of law and of \r\nopposition to the unlawful use of force. \r\n Not all members come from countries \r\nneighbouring Georgia or from countries in or near \r\nEurope, but the problem of Georgia is a problem for us \r\nall, for every country that is grappling with issues \r\nrelating to territorial integrity or to stronger neighbours \r\nabusing their advantages. The international order \r\nshould be based on strict compliance with the United \r\nNations Charter by all subjects of international law — \r\nfirst and foremost, by all States. It should be based on \r\ncommon responsibility for the fate of countries \r\nincapable of ensuring their own security alone.  \r\n Those were the motives that guided my response \r\nto the Georgian conflict and the actions of the \r\nPresidents of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. \r\nThe complete implementation of the peace plan, which \r\nshould also cover the issue of the territorial integrity of \r\nGeorgia, is a prerequisite for the further discussions \r\nabout the Caucasus to be held in Geneva in October \r\nand a prerequisite for the future of relations between \r\nthe European Union — of which Poland is the twenty-\r\nsixth member — and Russia. Those relations can be \r\ncorrect and mutual only if both sides respect \r\ninternational law in their relations both with each other \r\nand with third parties. \r\n One expression of Poland’s involvement in \r\ninternational security is its participation in a counter-\r\nterrorism coalition in many volatile regions of the \r\nworld. Today, more than 3,500 Polish troops and police \r\nofficers are taking part in global peacekeeping and \r\nstabilization forces — from Africa to the Balkans, \r\nthrough the Middle East and Asia.  \r\n Iraq was one such place. Through the five years \r\nof its presence in Iraq, Poland has made efforts to help \r\nits Iraqi friends and allies to ensure strengthened \r\nexternal and internal security. Its mission, the main \r\nstage of which comes to an end this year, has clearly \r\nbeen a success. Iraq today is definitely safer and more \r\nstable than a few years ago, despite the doubts \r\nexpressed in some circles.  \r\n What remains a challenge, however, is the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan. We deeply believe that the \r\nmission in Afghanistan, in which Poland is also taking \r\nan active part, is bound to end in success, not only a \r\nmilitary success in the fight against terrorism but also \r\nthe success of the Afghan nation in improving its day-\r\nto-day existence. Military action must also be \r\naccompanied by measures to stabilize the Afghan \r\neconomy, improve the internal security situation and \r\nenable Afghanistan to grow more quickly. I should like \r\nto believe that this mission will end successfully. \r\n The continuing lack of stability in the Middle \r\nEast is a source of concern for almost — the “almost” \r\nis regrettable — every country in the world, including \r\nPoland. The lengthy process of building an \r\nindependent Palestinian State should be completed as \r\nsoon as possible, for the sake of Palestinians and \r\nIsraelis alike, both nations being Poland’s friends. We \r\nwish the Palestinian people every success in their \r\nstruggle for an independent State. To Israel, with which \r\nwe have important historic ties, because many of its \r\ncitizens come from Poland, we wish successes and \r\npeace, a peace much needed by Israel.  \r\n I note with pleasure that our hopes are being \r\nraised by the situation in Lebanon. Poland believes that \r\nthe elections and the new President will bring the \r\nstability and peace for which the Lebanese people have \r\nbeen waiting for 35 years — and even before that the \r\nsituation was often difficult. We wish the new \r\nLebanese authorities and the nation of Lebanon every \r\nsuccess. We will be involved in this part of the world in \r\na spirit of international solidarity and because of our \r\nhistoric ties with the region.  \r\n The issues I have mentioned cannot be resolved \r\nby a single State or a single group of States. Today we \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n33 08-51839 \r\n \r\nsee clearly that we need joint action by all countries: \r\nrich and poor, from both the east and the west. \r\nHowever, in today’s world, where the division into east \r\nand west is no longer as important as it was in the past, \r\nwhat we need above all is solidarity between north and \r\nsouth; we must give help to those in need.  \r\n We need to promote democracy, of course \r\nadapting it to the cultural conditions and traditions of a \r\ngiven State, because, regardless of its flaws, there has \r\nnever in our history been a system more friendly to \r\nmankind. We should act jointly and in a spirit of \r\nsolidarity through effectively operating international \r\nstructures such as the United Nations and its agencies, \r\nwhich have global reach and an unchallenged position. \r\nThe Secretary-General rightly says that there should be \r\ndeeper coordination between the work of the agencies, \r\nirrespective of the great successes which the bodies \r\naffiliated to the United Nations have scored over recent \r\ndecades. \r\n What is most important, however, is to ensure \r\nuniversal respect for international law, human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms.  \r\n I hope that when we meet next year during the \r\nsixty-fourth session the world will be slightly safer and \r\na little closer to the principles that I have had the \r\nhonour to refer to in this address. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Poland for the statement he has just \r\nmade.  \r\n  Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. François Bozizé, President of the \r\nCentral African Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Central African \r\nRepublic. \r\n  Mr. François Bozizé, President of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. François Bozizé, President \r\nof the Central African Republic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Bozizé (spoke in French): First, I \r\nsincerely congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session. The role played by his country, \r\nNicaragua, in pursuing the purposes of the United \r\nNations and his long and distinguished career as a \r\ndiplomat have been recognized by his election. I assure \r\nhim of my country’s support and my own support as he \r\ncarries out his difficult and noble mission. \r\n I also pay Mr. Srgjan Kerim, who presided over \r\nthe sixty-second session, a well deserved tribute for the \r\nexcellent work he did throughout his term in office. \r\n I wish to express words of encouragement to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, for the important \r\ndirection he has given our Organization since taking up \r\nhis duties. \r\n My country, the Central African Republic, has \r\nsince 1996 experienced domestic instability fuelled by \r\nthe effects of numerous conflicts in neighbouring \r\nterritories. The Darfur crisis and the constant \r\nincursions of irregular armed bands in the north-east \r\nand north-west and of the Lord’s Resistance Army on \r\nthe southern frontier, bordering on the Sudan and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, have been \r\naccompanied by plunder, rape, deportation and the \r\nconscription of children under the age of 10. \r\n The use of that part of the Central African \r\nRepublic territory as a rear base for non-State armed \r\nelements represents a danger of the same type as those \r\nthat led to Security Council resolution 1778 (2007). \r\n I welcome the mandate given to the United \r\nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \r\nChad (MINURCAT) as part of a multidimensional \r\noperation to restore the safety and security conditions \r\nneeded for a voluntary and lasting return of refugees \r\nand persons displaced by the conflicts in that area of \r\nthe three frontiers that straddle the Central African \r\nRepublic, Chad and the Sudan.  \r\n However, with the mandate of the European \r\nUnion Force (EUFOR) ending in March 2009, and \r\nbecause of the fragility of the situation in the north-east \r\nand growing insecurity in the south-east, it is highly \r\ndesirable that MINURCAT’s mission be revised and \r\nenlarged. We earnestly hope that it will go beyond its \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 34 \r\n \r\ncurrent framework to become an operational force of \r\nthe United Nations, and that cooperation between \r\nMINURCAT and the other forces involved at the \r\nregional and community levels will continue. \r\n Referring to the situation in my country gives me \r\nthe opportunity to emphasize that the recurrent \r\npolitical and military crises have further increased \r\npoverty and food insecurity, particularly in the rural \r\nand agricultural areas. \r\n A suggested theme for this year’s general \r\ndebate — the impact of the world food crisis on \r\npoverty and hunger throughout the world — in addition \r\nto the need to democratize the United Nations, is at the \r\nheart of the international community’s concerns, and \r\nhas been for some decades. The first matter involves \r\nthe following questions: climate conditions, \r\ndemographic problems, indebtedness, free and \r\nequitable trade, redirecting the agricultural sector \r\ntowards biofuels, the price of oil and armed conflicts. \r\n In the current context of world trade and the \r\nworld economy, there is a tendency for natural \r\ndisasters and armed conflicts, because of their effect on \r\nsocio-economic structures, to accentuate the impact of \r\nthe food crisis on developing countries. \r\n For the Central African Republic, the food crisis \r\ncan be seen as somewhat paradoxical, in view of our \r\nnatural potential. The climate throughout the country is \r\nfavourable to pluvial agriculture, with an enviable \r\nannual rainfall of 800 millimetres in the extreme north \r\nand more than 1,500 millimetres in the south, and an \r\navailability of fresh water estimated at 37,000 cubic \r\nmetres per inhabitant.  \r\n Of more than 15 million hectares of arable land, only \r\n600,000 to 700,000 are cultivated. That is 1 per cent of our \r\nnational territory and 4.4 per cent of the total arable \r\narea. Less than 0.5 million hectares are being actively \r\nexploited by agricultural workers. \r\n Stock-raising land represents 9.3 million hectares \r\nout of a total of 16 million, with livestock totalling \r\nabout 3.2 million head of tropical breeds. \r\n The challenges to be overcome are the insecurity \r\nof rural areas, the disorganization of agricultural \r\nproducers, the low degree of support for the rural \r\ncommunity, the fact of being landlocked, the lack of \r\nbasic economic and social infrastructures, the exodus \r\nfrom the countryside and the impact of HIV/AIDS and \r\nmalaria, which have reduced the labour force and \r\nresulted in limited access to credit and fostered social \r\ndiscrimination. \r\n One of the Millennium Development Goals is to \r\nhalve, between 1996 and 2015, the number of those \r\nsuffering from hunger, and to halve, between 1990 and \r\n2015, the degree of poverty. \r\n There are a number of causes of the problems:  \r\nso-called natural causes and human causes. The natural \r\ncauses result from natural disasters: drought, \r\ndesertification, degradation of the environment and \r\nfloods, resulting in the erosion of arable land. Human \r\ncauses are regarded as having been responsible for \r\nmore than 35 per cent of the food emergencies in 2004, \r\ncompared with only 15 per cent in 1992. Wars and \r\neconomic and social upheaval have caused or worsened \r\nthe food situation. \r\n The General Assembly is the appropriate forum \r\nin which to raise and debate the problems confronting \r\nour world today. That is what is expected of us in the \r\nAssembly. \r\n There is no human endeavour that will not \r\nrespond to application. Therefore, it is possible to meet \r\nthe challenge of the food crisis. But our weakness is \r\nabove all our lack of the technical, economic and \r\nstructural capacity to create the conditions for \r\nagricultural production and productivity. \r\n I welcome the measures taken in June this year at \r\nthe World Food Summit of the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), held in \r\nRome, on the food crisis. The initiative on the upswing \r\nin the price of foodstuffs should mainly be based on \r\nstimulating food production in our countries. For that, \r\nwe look forward to implementation of the International \r\nMonetary Fund proposal to double its aid to agriculture \r\non the African continent, in the hope of strengthening \r\nthe productive capacity of our farmers and creating the \r\nstructural conditions for the production and marketing \r\nof agricultural goods. \r\n As part of regional talks on the food crisis, held \r\nin Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\non 29 July this year, under the aegis of the Economic \r\nCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS), it was \r\nagreed to make effective the Maputo Declaration and \r\nthe Abuja Declaration on, respectively, allocating \r\n10 per cent of our national budget to agriculture and \r\nassuring our countries better access to resources for \r\nagriculture. \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n35 08-51839 \r\n \r\n We have also given ECCAS a mandate to, among \r\nother actions, accelerate implementation of a common \r\nagricultural policy. Relaunching the agricultural sector \r\nis one of the priorities of my mandate as President of \r\nthe Central African Economic and Monetary \r\nCommunity (CEMAC). At the Yaoundé summit in June \r\nthis year we decided to put that concern at the centre of \r\nthe regional economic programme. \r\n None of these good resolutions can become \r\nreality for our farmers unless the support promised to \r\nthem actually reaches them. Particularly in Central \r\nAfrica, if these promises are kept they will speed up \r\nthe putting into place of regional focal points for \r\ndevelopment that will help to reduce the shortfalls in \r\nagricultural activity and the disparities between rural \r\nand urban areas. \r\n Food security has become a matter of concern for \r\nthe world. Hunger continues to be the worst weapon of \r\nmass destruction. The social crises seen in many places \r\nresult from the realization that food insecurity is \r\nworsening with the rising cost of living and other \r\nuncertainties, such as climate change and natural \r\ndisasters. \r\n In Central Africa, because of the destructive \r\naction of irregular military rebel groups, many \r\nmanipulated from outside, food insecurity, particularly \r\nin rural areas, is often provoked by lack of security. \r\nThat led the Government to organize, in April this year, \r\na national seminar on reforming the security sector, \r\nwhich was an important step towards peace. \r\n In the light of this, the process of inclusive \r\npolitical dialogue, which I have pledged to carry \r\nthrough to its conclusion, should be seen by all Central \r\nAfricans as a categorical imperative. \r\n Today, millions of people throughout the world \r\nare increasingly losing their means of subsistence \r\nbecause of the impact of food insecurity and of the \r\nsteep rise in oil prices on the world economy, with \r\nunprecedented consequences for world order and \r\npeace. \r\n Hunger, the environment, corruption and civil \r\nand ethnic conflicts are a burden for the most \r\nimpoverished peoples on earth. \r\n Other threats, such as terrorism, poverty and \r\nmisgovernment, also contribute to making the world \r\neven more vulnerable, and demand from us responses \r\nand methods that will bring about a lasting solution. \r\n In this age of interdependence of States, the \r\nprime solution and imperative need seems to be a \r\ncollective decision-making forum and an instrument \r\nfor rapid action. That was the vision of the founders of \r\nour Organization in 1945. \r\n But we must recognize today that the various \r\ninstitutions that make up the United Nations have their \r\nlimitations, and we must agree on the need for reform \r\nto make the Organization much more effective in order \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nseek the kind of peace that meets the current situation. \r\n My country is convinced of the importance of \r\ngenuine democratization of the United Nations system. \r\nIn that connection, particular attention should be given \r\nto the functioning of the Security Council, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions and the General Assembly. If together we \r\ntake courageous decisions to implement this ambitious \r\nproject, we shall give the world an ideal structure that \r\ncan tackle all international questions. This is an \r\nopportunity to build a world that is more secure, more \r\nequitable, more balanced and freer for all peoples. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic for the statement he has just made.  \r\nMr. François Bozizé, President of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Pedro Verona Rodrigues Pires, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cape Verde \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCape Verde. \r\nMr. Pedro Verona Rodrigues Pires, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cape Verde, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Pedro Verona Rodrigues \r\nPires, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Pires (spoke in Portuguese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): First, I \r\ncongratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nthird session. I wish him a successful presidency. I also \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 36 \r\n \r\nsalute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and express my \r\nhighest regard for his commitment to peace, dialogue \r\nand prosperity for all. \r\n The world grows in complexity, with its multiple \r\nchallenges and numerous risks and uncertainties. This \r\ncalls for increased multilateralism, more collective \r\nresponsibility and greater cooperation. In short, it \r\ndemands and expects more and better from the United \r\nNations. \r\n The world is undergoing a profound and \r\nmultifaceted crisis in the financial, energy, food and \r\nenvironmental areas. Indeed, we face an environment \r\nfraught with uncertainty in the short and long term, \r\nunderscored by financial instability, foreign exchange \r\nvolatility, escalating oil and food prices and a globally \r\ntroubled world economy. There is risk to our economic, \r\nhuman, political and military security — in other \r\nwords, our general and collective security. \r\n On the one hand, organized transnational crime \r\nand terrorism threaten international order and the rule \r\nof law. On the other hand, the effects of global \r\nwarming and climate change, as well as the risks \r\nimposed by their worsening, are real facts that confront \r\nworld leaders and institutions. \r\n World peace remains out of reach. Areas of armed \r\nconflict still exist. Indeed, they resurge repeatedly or \r\npersist at low intensity. In the meantime, new sources \r\nof tension arise in many places. However, I believe we \r\nagree that war is not the best way to overcome these \r\nchallenges. \r\n We also have failed to build security and trust \r\namong all and for all, large and small, rich and poor. \r\nWithout security, without social stability, without \r\npolitical and institutional cohesion, and above all \r\nwithout mutual trust between the international political \r\nactors, it is difficult to further the premises that may \r\ncontribute to ensuring a solution to major global \r\nproblems, resolving our main challenges, overcoming \r\nextreme poverty and the most pervasive endemic \r\ndiseases, as well as moving past current global social \r\nand economic imbalances. \r\n With the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals the international community \r\nexpressly undertook to contribute to overcoming this \r\nunsustainable situation. I therefore urge the Assembly \r\nto work towards the preservation of an international \r\nenvironment favourable to the achievement of the \r\ncommitment that we undertook — the social and \r\neconomic growth of the poorest countries, the \r\neradication of extreme poverty, the consolidation of \r\npeace, dialogue and international cooperation towards \r\ninternational balance, the defence of life and the \r\nplanet’s future. \r\n The current financial crisis is underscored by the \r\ninstability of the financial markets and the volatility in \r\nthe movement of capital, which put our worldwide \r\neconomic stability at risk. We must retain the global \r\nfinancial architecture. It seems necessary for us to \r\nagree on new forms of financial regulation that are \r\neffective, trustworthy and acceptable to all. \r\n The food crisis has placed hundreds of millions \r\nof people in a precarious situation. It is clear that \r\nurgent action is required to ensure increased \r\nagricultural production capable of meeting current and \r\nfuture needs. That requires the promotion of \r\nagricultural policies consistent with the demands of the \r\nsituation, the partnership of the rich and \r\ntechnologically more advanced countries and technical \r\nassistance from international organizations; it means \r\nthat attention must be given to modernizing and \r\nincreasing agricultural production and productivity in \r\nthe affected countries and regions. I think specifically \r\nof my country and the African continent.  \r\n Escalating oil prices have created serious \r\nproblems for the economies of the least developed and \r\nnon-producing countries. I ask, why not consider forms \r\nof compensation for the poorest and most affected \r\nnations in view of the enormous financial surpluses \r\nthat have been accumulated? Admittedly, such an act of \r\njustice and solidarity would not be enough. We must \r\ntherefore act individually and collectively and continue \r\nto promote energy alternatives and energy efficiency, \r\nas well as encourage reduced dependence on fossil \r\nfuels. Urgent and global measures are required to \r\novercome the serious environmental crisis and to \r\ndevelop innovative and safe options for the future of \r\nhumanity. That is the challenge that we must take up \r\nfor the sake of the future and that we must overcome \r\nfor the benefit of all.  \r\n We surely agree that humanity is at a decisive \r\nmoment in history that clearly runs counter to the \r\nparadigms of its recent past — a time when a new \r\nworld is painfully coming into being.  \r\n Recent experiences show that no single nation \r\ncan in isolation solve the great challenges and global \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n37 08-51839 \r\n \r\nproblems which the world faces. However, our \r\nuniversal institution does present the essential \r\nconditions and the required collective responsibility for \r\nsuch an endeavour. Therefore, it is incumbent on the \r\nUnited Nations to shoulder the tremendous mission of \r\npromoting more effective world governance.  \r\n However, to perform such a role, which is now \r\nmore complex than ever, the United Nations is called \r\nupon to adapt itself to the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, to express the major shaping forces of the \r\ncontemporary world and to ensure and convey \r\nconfidence to all of its Member States. Accordingly, \r\nthe United Nations system must be reformed and \r\nimproved and, above all, the representativeness and \r\nlegitimacy of the Security Council must be urgently \r\nexpanded and strengthened.  \r\n Thirty-five years ago, on 4 September 1973, the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau acceded to national \r\nsovereignty. I salute the delegation of Guinea-Bissau in \r\nthis room. It is our firm conviction that our brother \r\nnation will be able to overcome all the difficulties \r\ncurrently facing it and to consolidate the foundations of \r\nits stability under the rule of law.  \r\n Allow me also to welcome the recent legislative \r\nelections in Angola and to congratulate the people and \r\nauthorities of Angola for the responsible and transparent \r\nmanner in which those important elections were \r\nconducted.  \r\n I would further like to welcome the political \r\nagreements that led to the end of the political crisis in \r\nZimbabwe. That is a testament to the emancipation of \r\nour continent and to its aspiration to progress, and thus \r\nhelps to usher in the new era and the new world that \r\nwe so eagerly desire.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Cape Verde for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Pedro Rodrigues Pires, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cape Verde, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bamir Topi, President of the \r\nRepublic of Albania \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania. \r\nMr. Bamir Topi, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bamir Topi, President of \r\nthe Republic of Albania, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Topi (spoke in Albanian; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is a \r\nspecial pleasure for me to address the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. Allow me to \r\ncongratulate the Assembly President on his election to \r\nhis high position. Albania welcomes cooperation with \r\nhim. I would like to take this opportunity to assure the \r\nPresident of the full support of my country. I would \r\nalso like to express my highest praise to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his vision and continuous \r\nefforts to revitalize and to reform our Organization, the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n Allow me also to confirm Albania’s commitment \r\nto a strong and coherent United Nations, capable of \r\nsuccessfully tackling the challenges we currently face. \r\nWe fully support the joint initiatives and actions aimed \r\nat strengthening collective peace and security in order \r\nto achieve sustainable and long-term development to \r\npromote human rights and international cooperation. \r\nWe consider that reform of the Organization in all its \r\naspects is possible only through cooperation, dialogue \r\nand consensus.  \r\n The global fight against terrorism, especially \r\nthrough guaranteeing an effective response to this \r\ncollective threat, demands that the United Nations \r\ncontinue to play a very important role. My country, \r\nAlbania, has very actively met its responsibilities in the \r\nglobal fight against terrorism. In compliance with the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \r\nwhich the General Assembly unanimously passed on  \r\n8 September 2006, Albania continues to be a stability \r\nfactor in the region and beyond through its moderating \r\nand constructive policy. It contributes with \r\npeacekeeping troops in the framework of the United \r\nNations and other security organizations in \r\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Georgia and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. It recently deployed 68 troops to Chad as \r\npart of the European Union-led peacekeeping force. \r\nAlbania is also working to enhance its domestic \r\ncapacities to enable a greater presence in aiding global \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 38 \r\n \r\npeace and security by deepening its cooperation with \r\nthe United Nations in the field of peacekeeping \r\noperations.  \r\n Albania has already become part of the United \r\nNations system-wide coherence effort for reform of the \r\nOrganization by willingly joining the One United \r\nNations initiative. It fully supports this project and is \r\nactively working with United Nations agencies to secure \r\nnew ways of partnership in the fields of development, \r\nhumanitarian assistance and the environment. One United \r\nNations is being carried out in full respect for national \r\nsovereignty and national ownership of development and \r\nin compliance with the needs and priorities of our \r\ncountry, especially of the integration to the European \r\nUnion (EU) and meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs).  \r\n As a pilot country, we are aware of this \r\nresponsibility, and we will do everything possible to \r\nturn this initiative into a tangible success. In my \r\ncountry the MDGs are not viewed simply as \r\ndevelopment objectives, but also as a means for \r\ngrowth. Albania has nationalized the MDGs by drafting \r\nand following step-by-step implementation instructions \r\nfor the zonal strategies of development. It has also \r\nadded one more objective: that of good governance. \r\nKeeping in mind experiences to date, meeting the \r\nMDGs in countries with small and medium incomes \r\ndemands continuous support from the national \r\nleadership, a more efficient use of resources and a \r\ncloser partnership among all the players — in \r\nGovernments, the international community and civil \r\nsociety.  \r\n We are very active in the framework of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, and we are convinced that \r\nthis initiative already presents a political instrument of \r\nthe United Nations to build peace in the broader \r\nmeaning of the term. Following up that commitment, \r\nAlbania has compiled a national strategy of \r\nintercultural dialogue, which reflects the centuries-old \r\ntradition of full religious harmony and understanding.  \r\n Climate change presents a global concern and \r\nthreat, and as such it affects my country as well. \r\nAlbania considers it a priority issue and assesses it in \r\nthe framework of the implementation of the One \r\nUnited Nations initiative. It joins the international \r\ncommunity with determination in the challenge of \r\nglobal climate change and modestly contributes to \r\nreducing emissions quotas to secure a better and a \r\nmore developed future.  \r\n The world food crisis continues to be one of the \r\nmost complex challenges faced by humanity. It not \r\nonly affects the health and survival of millions of \r\npeople all over the world, but directly threatens \r\npolitical and economic stability by seriously putting \r\ninto question the achievement of the MDGs. The \r\ncauses of this crisis are numerous and complex. As \r\nsuch, they demand a multilevel, coherent and well-\r\ncoordinated response. My country hails the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s establishment of the High-Level Task Force \r\non the Global Food Security Crisis.  \r\n Albania is undertaking a full programme of \r\ninstitutional, economic and legal reforms through \r\nwhich we aim to transform Albania into a country \r\nattractive to foreign investments, with a market open to \r\nfree enterprise. I have the pleasure to point out that the \r\nlatest World Bank report listed Albania as second \r\namong countries that have implemented successful \r\nreforms to facilitate business practices during 2007 and \r\n2008.  \r\n Albania has gained the status of a medium-\r\nincome country, and I believe that this progress must \r\nbe consolidated in compliance with the new challenges \r\nof development. The national strategy for development \r\nand integration has determined our vision for the next \r\nseven years of Albania as a country of high democratic \r\nstandards, fully guaranteeing the fundamental human \r\nrights, with its sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment aimed at integrating into NATO and the \r\nEuropean Union, as well as harmonizing with the \r\nMDGs — a country providing a better and safer life to \r\nfuture generations.  \r\n Albania enjoys a solid and irreversible \r\nrelationship with the EU. The Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Agreement serves as our guide, and the \r\nprimary objective is the conclusion of the ratification \r\nagreement by the end of this year. The European \r\ncountries and the European Commission have invested \r\nconsiderably in Albania. We have responded to this \r\ncontribution not only with natural gratitude, but also \r\nwith concrete commitments and with joint and \r\ncoordinated work programmes in the fields of good \r\ngovernance, institutional functioning and economic \r\ngrowth and in the fight against organized crime and \r\ncorruption.  \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n39 08-51839 \r\n \r\n Albania’s path towards full Euro-Atlantic \r\nintegration is widely supported by the Albanian public \r\nand its political spectrum. In particular, the invitation \r\nto join NATO at the Bucharest Summit, the signing of \r\nthe alliance and the protocols on 8 July 2008 and the \r\nongoing ratification process all mark historic \r\nachievements for Albania and are a positive assessment \r\nof the new and tangible Albanian reality. Albania will \r\nrespond to this assessment with greater responsibility \r\nand determination in the face of the obligation that \r\nstems from full-fledged membership in the alliance, \r\nwhich will serve peace and security not only in the \r\nBalkans, but in the Mediterranean region and beyond.  \r\n Albania pays particular attention to the \r\nstrengthening of multilateral regional relations. It \r\nseriously encourages the process of regional \r\ncooperation by being an active partner in all of the \r\ninitiatives undertaken in South-East Europe. That \r\nengagement serves to promote good neighbourliness, \r\nstrengthening security, building trust among the \r\nregional countries, stability and full integration of all \r\nthe countries in the region in the Euro-Atlantic \r\nstructures.  \r\n Challenges such as the fight against terrorism, \r\norganized crime, arms proliferation and border \r\nmanagement have an interlinked character that can be \r\novercome only through joint actions, initiatives and \r\ncommitment. We will continue to play the same \r\nconstructive role for our benefit and for that of the \r\nwhole region.  \r\n Albania considers the foundation of the \r\nindependent and sovereign State of Kosovo as the most \r\nimportant historical event and development of our \r\nregion at the beginning of this century. An independent \r\nand democratic Kosovo, oriented towards Euro-\r\nAtlantic integration, is the just and most sustainable \r\nsolution. It is an example of the most successful \r\ninvestment made by the international community \r\ntowards the implementation of the rule of law, to long-\r\nterm stability and peace and development in the \r\nBalkans and beyond.  \r\n The independence of Kosovo finally frees that \r\npart of Europe from the nightmare of war, of  \r\ninter-ethnic conflicts and of ethnic cleansing and \r\ngenocide. It fulfils and respects the free will of the \r\npeople to break free from political oppression, \r\nhistorical injustices and the inability to develop. \r\nKosovo is no longer being led by the failed Yugoslavia, \r\nnor by the new moderate Yugoslavs. It is being led by \r\nthe principles of a civilized Europe and those of the \r\nuniversalized United Nations.  \r\n Albania encourages the people and the \r\nGovernment of Kosovo in their commitment to build a \r\ndemocratic and multi-ethnic society in which, \r\nregardless of ethnic considerations, its every citizen \r\nwill feel like a free man in his home and on his \r\nproperty. The new constitution of Kosovo and the \r\nAhtisaari package meet the highest standards of human \r\nrights and offer widespread protection to all the \r\ncommunities living in Kosovo, especially to the Serbs \r\nof Kosovo.  \r\n We are convinced that, following the guidelines \r\nof the Secretary-General of the United Nations, all \r\nnecessary actions will be taken as soon as possible: the \r\nUnited Nations presence will be reconfigured and the \r\nEuropean Union Rule of Law Mission Kosovo — \r\nEULEX — will be spread over the entire territory of \r\nKosovo, thus avoiding any vacuum of power and \r\nimposition of competences on top of each other and \r\npreventing any possible regressive attempt, regardless \r\nof where it may have originated, against this Euro-\r\nAtlantic process.  \r\n Albania deems as unfounded the efforts to draw \r\nparallels between Kosovo and the regions of Georgia — \r\nAbkhazia and South Ossetia. Numerous historical, \r\njudicial, constitutional, political and demographic \r\narguments demonstrate that Kosovo is a unique case — \r\na sui generis case — and the solution implemented is \r\nunique as well. As such, it does not and cannot serve as \r\na model to solve other conflicts either in the region or \r\nbeyond it. Any political, economic, military or \r\ndiplomatic endeavour against the consolidation or \r\nsoundness of the State of Kosovo would be a hopeless \r\nattempt against its process of integration to NATO and \r\nthe EU, a regressive move against the investments and \r\nprogress that we so direly need, and it could not be \r\nsold as valuable to the European Union. Historical \r\ndreams must not darken the vision of the future.  \r\n Albania is convinced that the recognition of the \r\nnew State of Kosovo is in the interests of Kosovo, \r\nAlbania, Serbia and of all its close and distant \r\nneighbours. It is in the interest of the European and \r\nMediterranean region. That is why Kosovo — this new \r\npolitical, economical and social reality — fully \r\ndeserves to be a Member of our United Nations as soon \r\nas possible. I call upon the Assembly to admit with \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 40 \r\n \r\nrealism this irreversible development by recognizing \r\nand supporting, without any reserve, the Republic of \r\nKosovo.  \r\n Albania continues to remain committed to \r\ncooperating with and enriching and fulfilling the \r\nUnited Nations ideals by fully believing in the active \r\nrole of the international community as it faces the \r\npresent global challenges. In order to fulfil this \r\nmission, we must all together give our support and \r\nreadiness to this Organization, which embodies not \r\nonly universal values, but also the aspirations of \r\nhumanity.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Albania for the statement just made.  \r\nMr. Bamir Topi, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Costa Rica.  \r\nMr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Óscar Arias Sánchez, President \r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.  \r\n President Arias Sánchez (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nreceived the news of your election to the General \r\nAssembly presidency, Sir, with a brother’s pride. \r\nTwenty-one years ago, it was through war in Central \r\nAmerica that we became acquainted. Today it is peace \r\nthat allows us to meet once more. In the name of the \r\npeople of Costa Rica, and in my own name as well, I \r\nam honoured to extend to you a brotherly Central \r\nAmerican greeting. \r\n I have come here to speak words of the urgency \r\nthat any leader feels at decisive moments in history. \r\nThis is not just any year. While we hold this General \r\nAssembly, millions of people who used to be able to \r\nmeet their most basic needs have seen the face of \r\npoverty once again. Hunger, that abominable monster \r\nthat we had escaped for so many years, has returned to \r\nchase away the dreams of humanity. Pessimism and \r\nhopelessness have taken control of our economies, and, \r\nas always, the poorest among us will pay the \r\nconsequences. World military spending has reached \r\n$3.3 billion per day, but international aid continues to \r\nreach the poorest countries at a snail’s pace and fails to \r\nreach middle-income countries altogether. Brutal \r\nhurricanes and intense droughts remind us that this \r\nplanet reacts to our irrationality, and the time that \r\nremains for us may be a countdown to disaster if we do \r\nnot make a change. \r\n It may be that in no other General Assembly have \r\nissues more global than now been discussed. Our \r\ninterdependence has made us all vulnerable, but in that \r\ninterdependence also lies our strength. In the past, a \r\nnation could avert its gaze from distant suffering and \r\nscorn the pain of others. Today, that option does not \r\nexist. Every victory and every failure is shared.  \r\n The man who, motivated by hunger, cuts down a \r\ntree in the virgin Amazon rainforest unwittingly \r\ndeprives us of a fraction of the air we breathe in this \r\nroom. The European mother who is forced to buy less \r\nfood because she cannot afford the costs unwittingly \r\naffects the economy of all nations in the world. The \r\nAfrican child who drops out of school because of a \r\nlack of resources unwittingly determines the future \r\nperformance of our species. We are all united in that, \r\nand perhaps for the first time in history, no one can \r\nlook in another direction. We are seated simultaneously \r\nat the prosecutor’s bench and at the defence table, in \r\nthe public gallery and in the judge’s chair.  \r\n We must take advantage of this moment when \r\nequality among nations is seen in the equality of our \r\nchallenges. We will not be able to face our realities \r\nunless we understand them completely. We will not be \r\nable to shine the light of reason upon our Earth if we \r\nintentionally leave some regions in the dark. If we are \r\nseriously to take up the challenges of our time it is \r\nright that like that old protagonist of the Charles \r\nDickens tale, we open our eyes to our past, our present \r\nand our future; we must guarantee peace and justice for \r\nthe past, peace and development for the present, peace \r\nand nature for the future. \r\n In the Preamble to the United Nations Charter, \r\nthe States that make up this Organization undertook to \r\nestablish conditions under which justice can be \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n41 08-51839 \r\n \r\nmaintained. Of those conditions, perhaps the most \r\nimportant is will: the will to demand that our \r\nobligations are fulfilled; the will to speak out when \r\ninternational law is violated; and, above all, the will to \r\nensure that acts that are an affront to all humankind do \r\nnot go unnoticed. \r\n Evil springs not only from action but also and, \r\nabove all, from omission. To keep silent when crimes \r\nare grave and responsibilities are clear is not to remain \r\nneutral but is to side with the aggressors. Our recent \r\npast is marked by horrendous, unpunished crimes that \r\ncall out, not for vengeance, but for justice. We cannot \r\naccept that evil is banal. If we do not want to repeat the \r\npainful history of Kosovo and Bosnia, of Rwanda and \r\nKampuchea, then it is time for the international \r\ncommunity to demand that those responsible for the \r\ncrimes committed in Darfur be judged before the \r\ninternational criminal court. Costa Rica will oppose \r\nany attempt to avoid such a path, which is the path of \r\npeace. Forgiveness is based on memory, not on \r\ndissimulation; and peace will be possible only through \r\nmemory. We must understand, in the words of Elie \r\nWiesel, “that the memory of evil will serve as a shield \r\nagainst evil; that the memory of death will serve as a \r\nshield against death”. \r\n If the spirit of the past calls on us to hold people \r\nresponsible for the violation of human rights, the spirit \r\nof the present calls on us to ensure that those rights are \r\nfulfilled today. Governments can indirectly hurt their \r\npeoples in many ways, one of which is excessive \r\nmilitary spending. In developing nations, in particular, \r\nevery long-range missile, every helicopter gunship and \r\nevery tank is a symbol of the deferred needs of our \r\npeople. On a planet where one sixth of the population \r\nlives on less than a dollar a day, spending $1.2 trillion \r\non arms and soldiers is an offence and a symbol of \r\nirrationality because the security of a satisfied world is \r\nmore certain than the security of an armed world. Latin \r\nAmerica is not immune to this phenomenon. Last year \r\nLatin American military spending reached $39 billion, \r\nin a region that has never been more peaceful or more \r\ndemocratic. \r\n I know of no greater perversion of values and no \r\ngreater misplacement of priorities. With a small \r\npercentage of world military spending we could give \r\ndrinking water to all of humanity, equip all homes with \r\nelectricity, achieve universal literacy, and eradicate all \r\npreventable diseases. I am not talking about the utopia \r\nof a world without armies. Unfortunately, that is an \r\nidea whose time has not yet come. I am talking about \r\ntiny percentages of an expenditure that could be \r\nreduced without harming the ability of countries to \r\ndefend themselves — particularly developing \r\ncountries. That is why my Government has presented \r\nthe Costa Rica consensus, an initiative that would \r\nestablish mechanisms to forgive debts and use \r\ninternational financial resources to support developing \r\nnations that spend more and more on environmental \r\nprotection, education, health care and housing for their \r\npeople and less and less on arms and soldiers. I am \r\nconvinced that that will bring us greater development, \r\ngreater security and greater peace than all the money \r\nthat we have now set aside for our armies. I humbly \r\nask members today to support this initiative. \r\n I also ask for members’ support for the arms trade \r\ntreaty that Costa Rica is advocating within this \r\nOrganization, to prohibit the transfer of arms to States, \r\ngroups or individuals if there is sufficient reason to \r\nbelieve that those arms will be used to violate human \r\nrights or international law, or to interfere with \r\nsustainable development. The destructive power of the \r\nworld’s existing 640 million small arms and light \r\nweapons, most in the hands of civilians, deserves the \r\nsame attention or even more attention than military \r\nspending. \r\n However, no matter how urgent it may be to \r\nensure the present development of our peoples, it is \r\nequally important to ensure their future development. \r\nThe spirit of the future, as we look ahead to it, offers \r\nus a desolate image. Imagine an unending desert, a \r\ncracked ground too hot to stand on. Imagine a planet \r\nwhere life has been displaced and only cockroaches, if \r\nanything, can survive. Imagine a world whose range of \r\ncolours, which until now has been endless, is reduced \r\nto grays and dark browns. Imagine polluted air, \r\nimpossible to breathe. “This is not a poor copy of \r\nJohn’s delirium during his exile on Patmos” as Gabriel \r\nGarcia Márquez once said. I am not describing the \r\nApocalypse but simply the world that awaits us if we \r\ndo not take action right away to declare “peace with \r\nnature”. \r\n Sixty years ago an illustrious Costa Rican, a \r\nvisionary and brave man, José Figueres Ferrer, \r\nabolished my country’s army. What had been the \r\ngeneral headquarters of the Costa Rican armed forces \r\nis today our main national museum. Our children have \r\nnever seen a column of soldiers on the march; they \r\nknow only the march of columns of ants. No Costa \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 42 \r\n \r\nRican children know the difference between this or that \r\nmissile, or this or that combat plane, but they can \r\ndistinguish among the trees of the forest and the \r\nanimals of the sea; they know the importance of the \r\nwater cycle, of wind energy, of rivers and of sun. Ours \r\nis a nation of peace among humans, but we also aspire \r\nto be a nation of peace with all forms of life. \r\n We have set a goal of becoming carbon-neutral \r\nby 2021. Last year we became the world leader for the \r\nnumber of trees per capita and square kilometre, \r\nplanting 5 million trees. In 2008 we will plant \r\n7 million more. We are leading an international crusade \r\nagainst global warming and environmental destruction, \r\nwith a special focus on the planet’s primary forests. \r\nToday, Assembly members, I ask you to join us. \r\n The march of humanity through history is neither \r\nlinear nor continuous. It is marked by detours and \r\npitfalls, and even by painful setbacks. As in Pedro \r\nCalderón de la Barcá’s play La Vida es Sueña, one \r\nmorning we awake as princes and the next we are no \r\nmore than beggars. But not everything in life is a \r\ndream. There are concrete realities that we have been \r\nable to build. There are indisputable achievements in \r\nthe history of humankind. This Organization is one of \r\nthem. Members may tell me that the United Nations is \r\nfounded on the search for peace, understanding among \r\npeoples and respect for international law. That is all \r\ntrue. But I dare to say that more than anything else this \r\nOrganization is founded on hope, the hope that our \r\nmarch is upward, that our future will be better, and that \r\na promised land lies behind the deserts of violence and \r\ninjustice that, with courage, we have been able to \r\ncross. \r\n I assure this Assembly that if we confront the \r\nspirit of our past, of our present and of our future, if we \r\nbuild peace on a base of justice, development and \r\nnature, and if we turn away from forgetfulness, arms \r\nand environmental destruction we will reach that \r\npromised land some day and our children and our \r\nchildren’s children will never again be beggars in the \r\nkingdom of their dreams. \r\n The President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Bayar Sanj, Prime \r\nMinister of Mongolia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Mongolia. \r\nMr. Bayar Sanj, Prime Minister of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Bayar Sanj, Prime \r\nMinister of Mongolia, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Sanj (Mongolia): This session of the General \r\nAssembly is taking place at a time when the \r\ninternational community is faced with formidable \r\nchallenges and threats of a much more complex nature. \r\nGlobal problems ranging from poverty, violence, \r\ninequality and disparity, terrorism, natural disasters and \r\nother acute problems have been further impeded by the \r\ncurrent global financial, food and energy crisis. As we \r\nlive in an increasingly globalized and interdependent \r\nworld the solutions demand our concerted action. \r\n The main theme of this session, namely, the \r\nimpact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger \r\nin the world, is most timely. Steep increases in staple \r\nfood prices lead to a global food crisis. Today millions \r\nof vulnerable people in poor countries who were \r\nprobably making ends meet, face even greater \r\nchallenges. It is a tragic setback that more than \r\n75 million additional people have been driven into \r\nhunger and poverty because of the food crisis. The \r\neconomic challenges posed by soaring food prices are \r\ndaunting. They take a toll on inflation rates, breed \r\neconomic protectionism, and further impede economic \r\ndevelopment for developing nations. Those countries \r\nalso had to cope with consequent macroeconomic \r\nimplications concerning the nexus between food price \r\nincreases and the overall inflation rate.  \r\n The Government of Mongolia, having recognized \r\nthe urgent need to address the food crisis, took the \r\nnecessary actions at both policy and practical levels to \r\nreduce its severe impact on the vulnerable strata of its \r\npopulation. My Government has designated this year as \r\nthe year for food supply and safety and aims to achieve \r\nthree main objectives: promoting food production to \r\nreduce the country’s dependence on imported goods; \r\n A/63/PV.8\r\n \r\n43 08-51839 \r\n \r\nraising public awareness about food quality; and \r\nensuring safe food production and processing in the \r\ncountry.  \r\n In pursuit of the first objective I launched at the \r\nbeginning of this year the third national crop \r\nrehabilitation drive, or campaign to reclaim virgin \r\nlands, to revive domestic agricultural production. As a \r\nresult of that nationwide campaign Mongolia is \r\nexpected to ensure self-sufficiency in major staple food \r\nproducts by 2010.  \r\n Countries throughout the world find themselves \r\nintimately affected by oil price hikes. In our case the \r\nsituation is aggravated by the fact that the surge in \r\nimported petroleum prices tends to be followed by \r\noverall price increases. Coal remains the primary \r\nenergy source used for electricity and heating in many \r\ncountries. The use of inefficient coal-burning \r\ntechnology causes air pollution, impacting negatively \r\non the population’s health and the environment. \r\nTherefore, research, development and deployment of \r\nclean coal technology are indeed top energy priorities \r\nfor coal-producing countries such as Mongolia.  \r\n The most effective way to mitigate these factors \r\nis to improve energy efficiency and pursue energy \r\ndiversification. In this regard, Mongolia commends the \r\nefforts of Member States and international \r\norganizations in research and development and the \r\ndeployment and transfer of innovative energy \r\ntechnologies such as renewable sources, cleaner and \r\nlower carbon technologies and nuclear power. These \r\nefforts are crucial as we seek to reduce our dependence \r\non fossil fuels. Ensuring energy security is a challenge \r\nthat requires a comprehensive solution both nationally \r\nand internationally. No country in the world is \r\nendowed with or has developed all possible energy \r\nsources, so every country has a vested interest in \r\nenergy cooperation and has something to contribute to \r\nit.  \r\n Mongolia gives special priority to energy \r\ncooperation in our region. An institutional foundation \r\nfor such cooperation has already been laid with regular \r\nsessions of the Senior Officials Committee on Energy \r\nCooperation in North-East Asia. The first session of the \r\nCommittee, hosted by the Mongolian Government in \r\nNovember 2005, established the Intergovernmental \r\nCollaborative Mechanism on Energy Cooperation in \r\nNorth-East Asia.  \r\n The Tavan Tolgoi, Mongolia’s huge coal coking \r\nproject has an important role to play in such \r\nsubregional cooperation. Such subregional cooperation \r\nin the energy sector, combined with ongoing efforts to \r\nspur the implementation of the Greater Tumen River \r\nInitiative, could be conducive to furthering the \r\nprospect for economic integration in North-East Asia, \r\none of the most dynamic and diverse regions of the \r\nworld. \r\n Since the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in 2000, we have passed \r\nthe midpoint in our efforts to implement them. \r\nProgress on MDG implementation around the globe \r\nreveals a sharply contrasting picture. Some countries \r\nfind themselves in more advanced stages of \r\nachievement, while others are still lagging far behind \r\non all or many important Goals. Thus, there is an \r\nurgent need to foster an effective global cooperation \r\naimed at assisting off-track countries in their efforts to \r\nreach the relevant targets by 2015. In this regard, my \r\ndelegation looks forward to tomorrow’s high-level \r\ndiscussion to come up with bold and specific \r\ncommitments to action. \r\n With rich deposits of coal, copper, gold, \r\nmolybdenum and uranium, most of them still largely \r\nuntapped, Mongolia indeed has an unprecedented \r\nopportunity to embark upon the path of rapid economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development — if we are able \r\nto overcome the partisan divisions which have in our \r\nrecent past all too often obstructed our onward \r\nmovement. It is with this in mind that the two main \r\npolitical parties, in an unprecedented move, set aside \r\ntheir long-standing differences and formed a unity \r\nGovernment only a few days ago, following the fifth \r\ndemocratic general elections, of 29 June.  \r\n The result of the elections, concluded to have \r\nbeen free and fair by more than 80 observers from \r\nmore than 20 countries, gave an undeniable majority to \r\nmy party, the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party \r\n(MPRP) with 45 out of the total of 76 seats in \r\nparliament. However, in the face of the pressing need \r\nto forge a national consensus on major development \r\nissues, the MPRP has decided voluntarily to give away \r\nits right to unilaterally form its own Government and \r\nhas concluded an agreement with the Mongolian \r\nDemocratic Party. Our two parties’ historic decision to \r\nwork hand in hand is testimony to our commitment to \r\nthe well-being and prosperity of the people of \r\nMongolia. \r\nA/63/PV.8  \r\n \r\n08-51839 44 \r\n \r\n I call it the fourth historic choice of my people \r\nover the last 100 years, following the declaration of \r\nindependence in 1911, the abolition of feudalism in \r\n1921-1924 and the embrace of democracy in 1990. I \r\nam most confident that this unity will greatly \r\ncontribute to pulling our efforts together to collectively \r\nsucceed in achieving the MDGs by 2015 and our \r\nMDG-based comprehensive national development \r\nstrategy by 2021, thus substantially improving the \r\nliving standards of our people and upgrading Mongolia \r\nto a middle-income country. \r\n In our globalized world, no nation can achieve its \r\ngoals all on its own. That includes Mongolia. \r\nConstructive engagement in world affairs through \r\nmultilateral cooperation mechanisms, with the United \r\nNations at the centre, and deeper integration into the \r\nworld economy will thus continue to be the cornerstone \r\nof Mongolia’s foreign policy. I understand all too well \r\nthat the existence of a stable, peaceful and prosperous \r\n  \r\nworld is a condition for the fulfilment of my \r\nGovernment’s — or any other Government’s — \r\npromise to its people.  \r\n With this in mind, I wish to reaffirm Mongolia’s \r\nstrong resolve to continue its active engagement in the \r\nwork of the United Nations and other multilateral \r\norganizations and processes, and our commitment to \r\nthe world Organization as a central coordinating \r\ninstrument of the common efforts of the family of \r\nnations to address the complex challenges of our times.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nMongolia for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Bayar Sanj, Prime Minister of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe meeting rose at 8.40 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
